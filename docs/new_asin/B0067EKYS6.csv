4962920,5,B0067EKYS6,"Having just finished teaching Gatsby, I went in with very low expectations. However, I thought this new version did a very good job of presenting the Jay Gatsby I know- he is very electric in his love/obsession of/with Daisy. I agree that Daisy, herself, was cut too much slack. I'm not sure why they decided to make her seem reasonable, but other than that, I was pleased with the production. I'm glad we are still interested in keeping The Great Gatsby relevant.",1368403200,,464,4.670731707317073
4962921,3,B0067EKYS6,"My thoughts are all over the place on this version of ""The Great Gatsby"".

Overall, this movie was only ""OK"" for me.  It felt exactly like ""Moulin Rouge"" except with a different storyline squished between the scenes of Nick Carraway writing/telling the story.

The movie was narrated by Nick Carraway, just as the novel was told in his perspective, however, in this movie version, Nick has gone mad and is using the experience of writing the story as a means of dealing with his internal struggles.  If you have seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moulin-Rouge-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005QZ7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moulin Rouge (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, this premise will sound familiar, because it is exactly the same.

In fact, the entire movie felt exactly the same as Moulin Rouge. The style was exactly the same which leads me to believe Baz is a One Trick Pony.  I felt that sort of style worked for a story like Moulin Rouge, but it didn't work as well in this version of The Great Gatsby.  There were even points where I felt Baz tried making this story comical and goofy.  It isn't a funny story, nor should it be.

I didn't like how this movie spoonfed information to the audience.  There is no tension, no nothing.  For example, in this movie, Gatsby tells Nick towards the end that he really didn't come from money, that actually his parents were poor.  If I remember correctly, Nick actually doesn't know that until after Gatsby died and Gatsby's father comes to the mansion and is the lone guest at the funeral.

I also didn't like that this movie seemed to try really hard to make Daisy a likable character.  Daisy shouldn't be a likable character.  She's a snooty-patoony rich girl who cares nothing about anyone other than herself and the things that she has.

Furthermore, they made Nick's character weak by turning him into a drunk/crazy person in the loony bin.  Nick was stronger than that.  Baz was just recycling this framing device from Moulin Rouge.

The only thing I really liked about this movie was Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby MacGuire.  The casting of these 2 characters was superb.

Overall, this movie was only ""ok"" for me.  It was alright to see once, but I won't bother with the DVD or ever watching it again.",1368316800,,2311,5.026315789473684
4962922,5,B0067EKYS6,"I have not read the book.  It wasn't required reading in my small Texas Panhandle high school.  The reviews were bad, so I  went not expecting much of the Baz Luhrmann production.  At two hours and twenty-some minutes it looked to be too long by half.  Also, neither Leonardo DiCaprio nor Tobey Maguire are favorites of mine.  So I was pleasantly surprised to be totally intrigued, entertained, and even touched by the film and its story of two deeply flawed characters and their tragic tale.  I found DiCaprio (Gatsby) and Maguire (Gatsby's friend Nick) to be quite satisfying in their roles as was Joel Edgerton (Daisy's husband Tom) who was new to me.  I was already sold on Carey Mulligan (Daisy) from her role in Drive.  The big party scenes at Gatsby's reminded me of Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge but it didn't distract from the overall flow of the film.  The dramatic scene in the hotel room with Daisy, Gatsby, Tom, Nick, and Jordan was the high point of the film and Nick as narrator worked splendidly.  Definitely worth seeing.",1368230400,3,1032,4.709497206703911
4962923,2,B0067EKYS6,"This has to be the worst movie I've seen in years. I am well aware of the dangers of making films from classic novels; however, some directors pull it off. (I'm thinking now of ""The Dead,"" ""The Remains of the Day"" and ""The Day of the Locust,"" to name three.)  Mr. Luhrmann's efforts--  sadly--  do not capture the essence of the novel while standing on its own as a successful work of art. I am amazed that the director of ""Strictly Ballroom,"" one of my favorite movies, is responsible in large part for this disaster.

Where to begin? The three main characters played by Leonardo DiCaprio (Gatsby), Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) and Carey Mulligan (Daisy) are hopelessly miscast. (That doesn't leave much to save the movie.)  To be asked to believe that Gatsby would pine for five years for the character played by Mulligan is simply absurd. Maguire, on the other hand, may be the most miscast. He, in a word, plays himself. At times,  furthermore, I thought the director was trying to produce an epic with all those crowd and party scenes a la ""Doctor Zhivago."" And the scenes shot around the service station look like a war zone. What on earth was that all about I ask. And did fashionable men from this period wear skinny-legged suits? Does anyone remember the wardrobe from the 1970's version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow? At least that movie got that much right.

I kept hoping this interminable film (over two hours long) would get better. It did not. Maybe (I thought) the appearance of Gatsby's father would add a tad of pathos to this runny West Egg, but he did not show. (Since surely every high school graduate in this country has been required to read the novel, I do not believe I am offering much of a ""spoiler,"" as they say.)

I kept looking for something to like about this movie as I checked  my watch often. The opening and closing credits are rather good, and occasional lines from Fitzgerald's novel reminded me of the reason it has become a classic, not enough, however, to justify spending money and, more importantly, two and a half hours of my precious life watching this Titanic. A Merchant Ivory production back in the day or Ang Lee perhaps could have made a fine movie from one of the great American novels but not this director.

I hear that Messers Luhrmann and DiCaprio are thinking of making yet another movie of ""Hamlet."" Surely they are not serious.",1368230400,7,2394,4.625
4962924,4,B0067EKYS6,"Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is an eye-popping, over-the-top, hyperkinetic, loud, heavy-handed circus, opera, and kitchen sink drama. Luhrmann takes F. Scott Fitzgerald's quiet, brief, cerebral novel and forces it through a kaleidoscope, crashing and scattering images in a peacock-colored, geometric Busby Berkeley dance routine. The amazing thing is, it works. The heart and soul of Fitzgerald's novel are there onscreen, and honored. Underneath the literal glitter - that sticks to characters' faces and shoulders in multicolored patterns - this is a genuinely serious film about big themes. It entertained me, it moved me, and I cared.

I am very sensitive to color and there were scenes in Luhrmann's ""Gatsby"" when I was overwhelmed by chromatic sensation. There is a hotel room orgy. The women wear vivid, finger-in-your-eye obvious eye shadow that contrasts with their vivid, obtrusive colored jewelry that clashes with their crazily colored dresses which throb in contrast with the hideous, red, patterned wallpaper which I am sure is the wallpaper in the hell that bad interior decorators go to. In another scene, purple, blue, and gold metallic streamers cascade downward on a dancer in a buttercup-yellow, ostrich feather tutu.

And it all moves so fast. That ostrich feather tutu is onscreen for seconds. The camera just keeps moving on to the next visual sensation. The costumes, the cars, the special effects, Bollywood film icon Amitabh Bachchan as Jewish gangster, Meyer Wolfsheim!!!: this movie's fabulosity budget must have been a zillion dollars.

Luhrmann lays everything on with a trowel. Long after the audience has realized that certain characters are users whose wealth protects them from the consequences of their evil deeds, Luhrmann tells the audience that, not just by speaking those words from Fitzgerald's book, but by writing the words out on the screen. Luhrmann shows, he tells, he beats you over the head. Only twice, though, did I feel he'd gone too far. Once when an obviously fake shooting star crossed the screen not once but I think three times, and when a character, struck by a car, is shown hurtling through space not once but twice. Once really was enough in both cases - one shooting star, one hurtling corpse.

There is a scene in this movie that took my breath away. After all that jazz, and color and movement, the movie just ... stops. It stops in a hotel room. If you've seen the film, you know exactly which scene I'm talking about. There are no special effects in this scene, no fireworks, no presto changeo. It's just a group of people sitting around talking. And suddenly you feel as if you are on Broadway watching a Tony-winning production of Eugene O'Neill. That scene make my guts churn; it broke my heart. Is Luhrmann showing off here? Saying, See, I could hook you in with fabulousness, and now I will move you with nothing more magical than words and real feelings.

The cast is perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio totally owns Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be human amidst all the glitz. He conveys Gatsby's power and his vulnerability. His voice is perfect; he sounds like someone trying to sound like a Kennedy. Joel Edgerton inhabits Tom Buchanan's brutality and snobbery. Isla Fisher is solid trash. Carey Mulligan brings Daisy to charming, pathetic, despicable life. Tobey Maguire is appropriately observant, lost, tempted, and jaded as Nick. Gorgeous Elizabeth Debicki channels Kirsten Scott Thomas. Richard Carter conveys quiet menace as a character whose job it is to announce, ""Chicago is calling."" If you can make that line scary, you are very talented.

The soundtrack mixes genuine jazz age music with rap-influenced music, and it works, too.",1368230400,3,3713,5.098684210526316
4962925,4,B0067EKYS6,"This is a review of Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"". Since this is text, allow me to be very obvious with the emphasis...this is a review of **Baz Luhrmann's** Gatsby. If you are expecting a movie that is true to the book, you WILL be disappointed. Mr Luhrmann has taken license with this movie that may irritate some, and I have already seen many reviews to that effect. Are these reviews wrong? Absolutely not!! People are free to dislike a movie as much as they are to love it! I have enjoyed reading the criticisms, perhaps more so than I did when reading several un-reasoned gushes that have appeared in various publications. Now, on to the review. A small preface: this will not be a blow-by-blow account of the movie, there are many synopses you can read for that. This is my (hopefully) reasoned analysis of what makes this a good movie...for me. I hope that this review will encourage some to see what might become a favorite for them, and for those who didn't enjoy the movie, I hope this presents a balanced view of its merits without the usual ""omg I love this movieee!!!"".

Note: I will be purchasing the DVD as soon as it becomes available and will update my review to comment on quality and content of said format!

There are several factors that have led me to this positive review. The first, and perhaps most important, is that despite having read and enjoyed Fitzgerald's book several times, I cannot say that it is a classic that I have a lot of attachment to. Allow me to explain: I am particularly fond of Arthur Miller's tragedies. I have read them, fallen in love with them, and even wrote my AP English final essay on Miller's tragic heroes. If a director took a lot of license with an interpretation of Miller's works, I may take issue. With TGG however, I do not have this close bond. I enjoy the story, I enjoy Fitzgerald's fantastic writing, but without that emotional connection I think I was more free to enjoy the movie in its own right. If The Great Gatsby was one of your favorites, and you do not believe that it should be changed, this probably won't be a movie you will appreciate. You would be entitled to this, but for the sake of argument (and to understand my review), this is an important point.

The second factor that led me to enjoy this movie is that I have an appreciation for Luhrmann's overal style. Now, this is highly personal, and many do not enjoy his carnival-type use of colors, movement and sound. As another reviewer mentioned (and hit the nail on the head), it is almost cartoonish. As with Baz' Romeo & Juliet, as well as with Moulin Rouge, his direction is almost parody-like, often putting ideals over character portrayals. If 'muted' and 'understated' are words you enjoy in connection with a film, this probably won't be the movie for you. To give a more tangible example; if your definition of cinematographical magic is more in line with the work of Roberto Benigni's 'La Vita  Bella', you may find Luhrmann's brand of magic too brash. My wife came with me to see this movie for date night - she found that the movie was at times ""too much"" to handle in terms of audio and visual stimulation. I can absolutely see how this would be true for some.

The third and final overall factor, was the acting of the two male leads. I went to this movie with some trepidation - though I absolutely enjoy Di Caprio's acting abilities, I have to admit that I usually do not enjoy Maguire's performances. I cannot really explain why, I simply have found no connection with him as an actor over the years. I am pleased to say that this movie changed this for me. My personal opinion is that Leonardo Di Caprio nailed Gatsby. Richard Brody of The New Yorker disagrees (in a very well-written review easily found via Google), but I think that Di Caprio's performance embodies Fitzgerald's own description of Gatsby, that is """"an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd."" At first I was annoyed by the two teenagers sitting in front of us, chortling every time ""old sport"" was said, but then I realized that they had inadvertently UNDERSTOOD - Gatsby is living a lie, keeping up appearances, and is doing so in a manner that is bordering on absurd. Initially presented as being almost mythical in social stature, Di Caprio does a great job at portraying a ""nobody"" watching his lie fall apart around him. As I mentioned, I was a little worried about Maguire, but he gave me a new understanding of the short-lived naivet inherent in Carraway's character, and for that I am grateful. In real life, Maguire seems to have a perennial ""green"" way about him - he's 37 and yet has a youthfulness (not immaturity) that only helped convince me when playing Carraway.

Now, on to what I didn't like about the movie. Keeping in line with Luhrmann's modus operandi, popular music features prominently in this adaptation. While not inherently a bad thing, I feel as though it was almost done a little *too* enthusiastically this time around. In Moulin Rouge, Baz shook up the industry by reinterpreting classics, a bold move that was applauded by some and despised by others. This time around I felt as though he was almost pandering to younger viewers by incorporating a lot of pop music. Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I don't feel as though such a classic tale with timeless attraction needs help to be relevant for today's viewers. The second thing that was a little irksome was the performance of Joel Edgerton and Carey Mulligan as Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Despite acting the parts relatively well, I felt as though they lacked the multi-dimensional layers of character that their screen-mates achieved. In very simplistic terms, their portrayal was too clean and single-faceted.

Overall, was the movie perfect? Definitely not. Were there some areas that were ""overkill""? Absolutely. That said, I have to be honest and say that I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. I appreciated the visual representation of the dichotomy between rich and poor, between black and white. I enjoyed the strong historical context presented, without which the book itself does not make sense. The dialogue was clever in its own right, often funny and rarely boring. Again, if you are not expecting an interpretation of the book, you most likely be disappointed, but if you go into this expecting one artist (Luhrmann) interpreting another's art (Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby) I think you might be pleasantly surprised. Despite maintaining strong allusions to the symbolism and emotional ""messiness"" found in the book, I personally feel as though the ""repeating the past"" theme was only briefly touched on and not given the weight that I found it to have in the book. Usually I am not surprised when story lines are given preferential treatment over bigger-picture philosophical ideas on screen, but I have to say that I expected more from Luhrmann who usually tackles these head on. Though open discussion of sociology/philosophy was slightly lacking, I think the film did a great job at presenting the ideas of extravagance, deceit and love for further internal reflection, allowing each viewer to come to their own conclusions.

One final note: I did not see this movie in 3D, nor do I intend on doing so. There are some movies (like Toy Story 3) that make good use of 3D as a ""fun factor"", but I feel as though a classic such as The Great Gatsby does not need it, and I suspect it was done because 3D movies are ""in"" right now...

I'm not saying you must rush out and see this movie tonight, but I think it has enough entertainment and substance to be worth a few hours of your time.",1368230400,24,7682,4.680236861584012
4962926,5,B0067EKYS6,"""The Great Gatsby Film"" featured a wild but entertaining tale of the complicated love triangle between the characters of Tom Buchanan, Myrtle Wilson, Daisy Buchanan, and Jay Gatsby.  Joel Edgerton and Isla Fisher did good jobs in capturing the torrid but scandalous romance between Tom Buchanan and Myrtle Wilson. However, I admit that my three favorite character portrayals in the movie were that of Jay Gatsby (played in an extraordinary way by Leonardo Dicaprio), Daisy Buchanan (sensual and brilliant portrayal), and Nick Carraway (outstanding performance by Tobey Maguire). I personally feel that Dicaprio really became one with the Jay Gatsby character and brought the Gatsby persona to life. It was both touching and tragic to see how far he went for his love of Daisy Buchanan. You then have the character of Daisy Buchanan who is mutually in love with Jay Gatsby, and is conflicted on what to do. Last, but not least, there is the heartfelt depiction of Nick Carraway as one with a strong conscience and sees mainly the best in Jay Gatsby. However, his natural concern for Gatsby towards the end of the film was portrayed in an extreme light.  """,1368144000,2,1154,4.943298969072165
4962927,1,B0067EKYS6,"CGI is becoming the ruin of serious films. Its over-use is leading to films that ever more cartoonish with overblown designs, garish colors and visuals that are notable for their utter excess. This film, in my opinion, takes things to a whole new level of ugly. Its a visually loud film with no real sense of style to speak of. Like most CGI, its so poorly done that it screams obvious fake at least to me. The film has all the visual style of Joel Schumaker's 1997 ""Batman and Robin"" and that is not a complement. Some have complained about the music not being appropriate. I'm not sure about that. If anything, they didn't go far enough with the music. Only a disco soundtrack straight out of the 1970s would have been appropriate.

Worse yet is the script which isn't very respectful of the novel. They invented a new framing sequence which was completely unnecessary. They seemed desperate to make Daisy Buchanan a good and likeable character which she should not be. What I liked the least was the removal of Gatsby's father from the story. The father showing up to the funeral is, in my opinion, one of the great moments in the entire book.

Many of the other key moments in the story are simply overwhelmed by the visuals and noise. The meeting in the city with Meyer Wolfshiem falls flat as a scene because there is so much ""junk"" going on for the sake of going on in the background. They keep going back to a trumpet player on a fire escape for no particular reason.

As far as casting, Leonardo DiCaprio works out as the main character far better than I would have expected. He captures the essense of being a fake very well. Joel Edgerton doesn't work as Tom Buchanan at all. They needed someone who could do a credible WASPy rich hypocrite and that is just not him. Elizabeth Debicki is good, but her character is not given much of anything to do. Amitabh Bachchan was a misfire in that someone seems to have told him to play the part as a vampire. The faults of ""Daisy"" are faults in the construction of the script. Tobey Maguire does a reasonable job, but nothing special.

In some sense, many of the flaws of the film are really simply expressions of Baz Luhrmann's style. But where Moulin Rouge seemed in step with excess of the times when it was released, Gatsby seems completely out of touch.

In terms of the music, Luhrmann's comments sort of speak for themselves:

""The question for me in approaching Gatsby was how to elicit from our audience the same level of excitement and pop cultural immediacy toward the world that Fitzgerald did for his audience? And in our age, the energy of jazz is caught in the energy of hip-hop.""

The problem of course is that where they went for that excitement, energy and pop cultural immediacy to a couple people who no longer have ANY of those things: Jay Z and Beyonce. They found ""pop culture immediacy"" in established acts like Fergie, U2, Bryan Ferry and Amy Winehouse among others. The idea of using high-energy modern music was not a bad one, but they didn't carry it through. They went for celebrity names and a style of music that was low energy.

People who like the overblown style of Baz Luhrmann and who are not very familar with the novel might enjoy this. But for me, it was just a pointless display of excess.",1368144000,74,3281,4.511784511784512
4962928,4,B0067EKYS6,"Since its original publication in April 1925, The Great Gatsby has received the adaptation treatment several times over its near 90 year history - including in film, television, and theater.  F. Scott Fitzgerald's American masterpiece is regarded as one of the greatest stories in literature, so it's not at all surprising that this story has been tackled so many times.  However, there has yet to be one version (outside of the novel) that has been able to do the story complete justice - and that is largely due to the complexity of the story.  The plot and character details within the novel are beautifully written, and haven't exactly translated well to any other medium up to this point.  Now, here we are in 2013 and the same two men that made Romeo and Juliet hip again, Baz Luhrmann and Leonardo DiCaprio, are back together once more, adapting the tale of Mr. Gatsby in The Great Gatsby.

Directed by Baz Luhrmann (Romeo + Juliet, Moulin Rouge!), The Great Gatsby stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, the mysteriously rich neighbor of Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire).  Constantly throwing elaborate extravaganzas, Jay Gatsby asks the assistance of his neighbor to reunite him with his old flame, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) - Nick's cousin.  Despite the fact that Daisy is now a married woman, Gatsby sets out to reestablish his relationship with the woman he loved and lost, prior to joining the fight in World War I.  Joel Edgerton, Isla Fischer, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki also star in supporting roles.

If you've seen the commercials for The Great Gatsby (and the odds say you probably have), you'll most likely have noticed that even though the film still takes place in the American 1920s, the story has been modernly modified with hip-hop music to go along with the glitz and glamour of the &uuml;ber rich New York lifestyle.  Despite the modern additions to this classic story, the fans of the novel can be rest assured that the substance of the story is still intact.  The plot still surrounds the love entanglement of Gatsby and Daisy, all the while still featuring the same important themes (repeating the past and social/class standing) and symbolism (most notably the green light and the watching eyes billboard) of the novel - only with a ton of choreographed dancing and bass pumping Jay-Z music.  Honestly, the music is difficult to deal with in the beginning, but once the film's plot shifts into high gear, the music only adds to the experience and enjoyment...and depending on your music tolerance, you'll either learn to love it, or simply hate it all together.

Like the novel and the majority of films, The Great Gatsby features a three part stanza, the first of which centers on Toby Maguire's character, Nick Carraway, and his infatuation with the life of his next door neighbor, Jay Gatsby.  Upon meeting, Carraway and Gatsby's friendship instantly blossoms to the point that Gatsby asks Carraway for help reintroducing him to his cousin and former lover.  The second part of the stanza features the love affair and growing tensions surrounding the consequences of Gatsby trying to make Daisy leave her husband - who has been nothing other than unfaithful to his wife.  In the final portion of the film, Daisy's decision in regards to whom she wants to be with (Gatsby or her husband), along with the car accident and murder, carry you through to the credits.

The acting in the film is certainly nothing Oscar-worthy, with Leonardo DiCaprio and Toby Maguire dominating the majority of the scenes.  These two do a good enough job interacting with one another, DiCaprio always sprouting confidence while Maguire watches in admiration.  DiCaprio gives everything that you'd expect from him at this point in his career, working hard at being the heartthrob.  Maguire, on the other hand, is just along for the ride as a moderately enjoyable moderator, always two steps behind Gatsby, never giving in to the propositions of wealth offered to him.  The damsels of the film, Carey Mulligan, Elizabeth Debicki, and Isla Fisher, each play the part they were cast to play, but none of them are ever really able to emotionally connect with the meaningful substance of their characters.  In the end, the cast could have been better, but each member is able to pull their weight just enough to get the film across the finish line.

Overall, the modern adaptation of The Great Gatsby reeks with the same over exaggerated flare that made Baz Luhrmann's version of Romeo and Juliet so popular with teens and young adults.  No, The Great Gatsby will not be for everyone (catering to a younger generation), but it will most certainly bring this classic tale to a new generation and back into the spotlight where it belongs.  At the same time, the film sacrifices plot and character development in order to add dancing, drop more confetti, and submit to the Hollywood style of entertainment.  Still, the scenery is beautiful (even though fake at times), and the heart of the story remains in the right place.  In the end, The Great Gatsby is an alluring plot that will draw you in with its glamorous ambition and leaving you clapping your hands with a final approval and endorsement.

4962929,4,B0067EKYS6,"When I saw this classic novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald was being adapted and filmed again, I quickly re-read the book, so it would be fresh in my mind. Directed by the audacious Australian Baz Luhrmann (""Moulin Rouge!"" and ""Strictly Ballroom""), the early scenes are a bit too ""Baz"" (gaudy and frenetic with RAPPING!) but after the story settles in, this is a terrific PG-13 movie. Don't worry about seeing it in 3D because the story is the main thing; both DiCaprio and Mulligan fit their roles to a ""T.""

In fact, all of this cast is great:
  * Leonardo DiCaprio (""J Edgar"" and ""Shutter Island"") is perfect as Jay Gatsby, the mysterious, phenomenally wealthy resident of West Egg, a location on Long Island. He is a free-wheeling host who throws lavish parties that everyone who is anyone must attend.
  * Carrie Mulligan (""Never Let Me Go"" and ""Drive"") is the tragic Daisy Buchanan, the enchanting mirage from Gatsby's past.
  * Joel Edgerton (""Warrior"" and ""Kinky Boots"") is Tom Buchanan, Daisy's possessive husband: promiscuous, wealthy, and vengeful.
  * Tobey Maguire (""The Details"" and ""Labor Day"") is our alter ego, Nick Carraway, who narrates the story and represents our point of view. His cottage is next door to Gatsby's mansion, so they become friends. By the way, Daisy is his cousin.
  * Isla Fisher (""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Rango"") is Myrtle, Tom Buchanan's lover. She lives over a service station on the road to New York City.
  * Jason Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""Lawless"") is George Wilson, the guy we come to pity. It's his wife Myrtle who is the catalyst for the story.

It's nice to see Luhrmann use his fellow Aussies in this one. Edgerton, Fisher and Clarke all hail from Down Under, as do many other supporting cast members. In addition, this splendid film was shot entirely in Oz. Good on ya, mate!",1368057600,7,1826,4.7555555555555555

I than could focus on the characters and see if they were portrayed accurately. There were some parts that were left out of the movie that were not in the book, such as Daisys daughter never appears throughout and the clock in Nicks house was not broken to begin with. The clock was broken when Gatsby knocked it over and it fell to the floor. I thought Gatsby was portrayed correctly even though I couldn't stand the way Leo says, old sport he did a great job.  The two characters who I was confused on/disagreed with were Daisy and Nick. Nick (Peter Parker from Spiderman) was nothing like I pictured him. He seemed to be much more involved in the heart of the stories conflicts in the novel, but in the movie, he is clueless to his surroundings. Nick was so much more involved with Jordan in the book and there is nothing about her whatsoever in the movie. It was a big point throughout the novel. The focus was very much on the main characters in the party scenes at Gatsbys and I feel like they should have broadened their horizons some more. It also felt like things were repeated. Certain flashbacks the same clip or almost the same scene at the party. Gatsby owns a large property with lots of things going on, there is more to see. Most of all, the ending was a big letdown. The whole movie went on and knowing the end was coming it just was not good enough. The narration and the words at the end was cool, but much more needed to be done. The scene where Gatsby was shot was well done and was shown well. When the car hit Myrtle, it was too glamorized, and it seemed much more violent in the book. I am aware that showing something on the big screen is different than the text of the novel, but it was one of the major conflicts throughout and I thought needed to shown better. Daisy was nothing like I pictured her and thought of. She was frailer than I thought in my mind. She seemed to have a much larger presence in the book. Overall, I liked the movie and thought it was well made. I would give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars. Well done old sport.",1525046400,,2219,4.243498817966903

I didn't mind the sound track with the rap, and pop as is the complaint of many poor reviews. It actually just made me chuckle a few times. In my opinion they butchered the character of Nick Caraway. His was the worst portrayed of them all. Maybe it was the actor, the Script, the director or a combination of all three, but they really failed F. Scott Fitzgerald in this adaptation of his Novel in this case. First of all: in the movie they portray Nick as this doe eyed boy coming from a low class family who acts like he has absolutely no idea what he's doing in any scene, like he's never had any kind of interaction with wealth in anyway before moving next door to Gatsby. When in the novel he may have not come from a filthy rich family like Daisy or Tom, or ever seen the kind of extravagant wealth displayed by Gatsby, but he did come from a higher middle class family, respectable and established. He was Daisy's cousin after all, he surely would have been exposed to the rich before, just not as over the top as Gatsby and the Buchanans. They also really failed to show that Nick had a life outside of the parties and misadventures. His relationship with Jordan was non existent in the movie, his job, his actual thoughts on what was going on with everyone was barely shown. I understand that this is an account of his memories of that summer as an observer of events, but in the novel he had way more to say and do. I also didn't like this films portrayal of Meyer Wolfsheim. I know he's supposed to be a man who deals with things outside the law, and has his fair share of shady schemes, but this movie really makes him out to be this despicable, horrible person and I really don't think Fitzgerald wanted him to be seen like that. The other Characters weren't that bad as they were portrayed. I think Tom was the most accurate out of all the Characters. Leonardo DiCaprio did a pretty good job of his portrayal of Gatsby, but honestly I think he would have done a better job as Nick if the script would have done Nick Justice anyway. I'm not sure who would have been better for Gatsby, maybe Daniel Craig or someone who could have been good at being an American trying to pretend to be an Oxford man. I really think Leonardo could have made Nick brilliant if the script wouldn't have killed Nick's character, but I still think he did a decent job as Gatsby. There were a few more things that annoyed me, but those are trivial. Overall it didn't miss the mark completely, but it could have been fantastic with a few little tweaks.",1522195200,,2719,4.354330708661418

Seemed rather low-budget for me, but then again it was made in the 1970's. I've also seen a theater performance adaptation of it in a small stage production, and I also thought it was lacking (definitely not something that would have ever made it to Broadway, that's for sure)... This movie however is the best adaptation of the book, in my opinion. The costumes and effects were beautiful, as were the settings and props, and stage designs.

I didn't feel the 20's in this, I felt a lot of people running around in 20's garb trying to unsuccessfully make us believe it's the 20s.  The acting was subpar, and a little painful at times.

4963228,4,B0067EKYS6,"Quick Story:  Nick Calloway (Toby Maguire) is an aspiring Wall Street bond salesman chasing his dream (riches), happens to move next to Gatsby (DiCaprio) also chasing a dream (one woman).  Gatsby uses Nick to get to his cousin Daisy and though she has married, pursues her to restart the romance they once shared.

Acting was good if mostly over the top.  I think Toby Maguire was probably the most believable though at times i hated looking at his facial expressions (near beginning when he gazes at the chandelier especially)  As far as playing Gatsby, I think I liked Robert Redford better as Gatsby in 1974.  DiCaprio has this weird accent that he dips in and out of throughout the film.  I am torn about his performance in that while I mostly didn't like how at times he seemed to be trying too hard seem big, wealthy, and gregarious;  that also as an actor, assists him to easily break that facade down over the next part of the film.  Also, this film is stylized in such a way that a normal performance might seem out of place, so I can't fault him or the rest of the cast too much for seeming to be putting on more of a show than being believable people.  This over the top performance wasn't limited to DiCaprio, when we first meet Tom Buchanan (Joel Eagerton) he too was putting on a performance seemingly more worthy of a stage production, like in the way he spoke and gestures.  Carey Mulligan was good as Daisy and Isla Fischer is good as Myrtle but they take mostly a backseat among the big personalities.

Overall, it's visually stunning from camera shots, colors, backgrounds, and editing, all was marvelous.  The editing room did a great job cutting scenes in interesting ways the original film (Redford's Gatsby)  just couldn't.  I enjoyed the soundtrack that used elements both old and new and mixed them together to form a balance of modern relevance (party atmosphere) and true to the time period.  Though it's in this focus on visuals that is it's greatest weakness, the visuals distract from and ensure that parts of the film won't be as good, substance and acting.

I hated the first half of the movie.  DiCaprio saying the words ""old sport"" in a weird accent stuck out so much - it seemed unnatural and the way he said it and how often he said it, annoyed the bazjesus out of me.  Much of the 1st half seemed to over-the-top and forced.  The second half of the movie is when everything happens.  The acting feels much more real here.  The events that happen in the 2nd half are more engaging.  The way they did the ending was perfect.  I was highly impressed by the way they captured the shots and what you see in the final frames of the film - the pages of the book, ""The Great Gatsby"" and the green light that is highlighted throughout as symbol of the distance, barrier, hope and dream of Gatsby fades away.  I gave it 4 stars because it is better than an average film in cast and visuals, but I refuse to give it a 5 because I don't love it and won't pursue owning it.  I saw the original and this one. I didn't like the original at all. I like this one better but still won't need to watch it again.",1515974400,,3129,4.426573426573427
4963229,5,B0067EKYS6,"In our hindsight version of the roaring '20's, it's all flappers, gangsters, dancing, and alcohol.  The Great Gatsby novel reinforced that stereotype, and this movie amplifies it a thousandfold.  Too much?  Beautifully so, drawing the viewer into the lavish, over the top life of Gatsby as the story unfolds.

The narrative device of Nick telling the story is an elegant way to work Fitzgerald's direct quotes into the movie, appreciated  for their enduring beauty through the years.  The soundtrack is everywhere, from modern hip hop to jazz to Lana Del Ray's sultry, foreshadowing crooning.

The views, sets, costumes and scenery are all both perfect and larger than life, a beautiful way to frame and underscore Gatsby, with his all too human longings and flaws.  Nick is the fish out of water, new to the environment and trying so hard to blend yet the most stable of the group.  And Daisy, the object of Gatsby's everything, is conflicted, confused, and led by the men in her life.  The acting is spot on, making this a favorite.",1515369600,,1034,4.857142857142857
4963230,5,B0067EKYS6,"First of all, I Love the 1925 F. Scott Fitzgerald novel. The novel is regarded as the best reflection of The Roaring 20s/The Jazz Age (think Flapper culture). I read it in college and then many times since. But this is about the movie. But if you are a fan if the book and have not seen the movie then you are probably wondering, ""How do the two compare?""

I am not going into the may comparisons and contrasts and if you have just read the book once, then you many not notice very many differences at all. Yes, there are some contradictions between the two, but not enough to be a deal killer. But on the other hand, YES, there are many close comparisons the movie makes to the novel, but keep in mind that this movie is mainly about the book's reflection of the times, and the themes, and symbolism that emerge between the society, setting and the well-defined characters.

Well, back to the movie itself. It is visual candy. The hard stuff and the ones that melt in your mouth. I love the cast selection, the cinematography, the music (I love the songs Young and Beautiful and the remake of U2's Love is Blindness), the pacing, the suspense and the love story. It was a crooked time that was lived through too much idleness, want, need,corruption, and liquid confusion. Not to mention some having too much money with a bankrupt soul and others having too little money and the want to sell their souls.  And this is perfectly reflected throughout the movie.

I do not want to create any spoilers for those who have yet to see this picture, so I will just say that I do recommend it whole-heartedly. It is a masterpiece that needs to be studied.

As for the 3D, it is a bonus. I Love it! It is amazing in my opinion. Please keep in mind,  I do not know about what is good vs. bad 3D. I just know what I like when I see it. Some may want to chime in on this, but don't. I like it and you will not convince me that it is bad 3D. I play it on my curved Samsung TV and crank it up and travel back to the 1920's and watch a beautifully sad story of misguided people in troubled times.

4963232,3,B0067EKYS6,"This is one of the best 3D movies I've ever seen. Most 3D movies use 3D as an afterthought. Every scene in Gatsby is shot to maximize the 3D effect with great depth.

I only mildly liked it as a movie. It's faithful to the book. I had to read it for school decades ago and don't remember it well. I didn't like it, but that could be due to the environment of being forced to read it. I'm not in a position to compare the two. I can only evaluate the movie as a standalone experience.

The Great Gatsby is a story about the dangers of excessive consumerism. As much as that problem resonates today, it is very hard to make that point in a movie without explicitly hammering the message. Most viewers aren't going to catch that the characters are symbols for that message. Instead, they see a story of unrequited love in a very odd setting with a downer ending. The movie has a constant voiceover narration that I always find irritating. That may work in books, but it's an awkward contrivance in the visual narrative of movies.

I would have given the movie 4 stars, but the disk said it did not detect a 3D display and would not play. I had to waste time troubleshooting. The problem was that Auto Detect was turned off on my Sony player. Turning it on resolved the issue.",1514505600,,1272,4.313807531380753

Director Baz Luhrmann, a true auteur in the sense that all of his movies noticeably embody his style  and for The Great Gatsby he may have been the perfect person for this story for his vision to fashion a spectacularly eccentric world that simultaneously carries itself as a major Hollywood love story. High-end productions that garnish grand romance with lavish production value often walk the tightrope of difficulty when attempting to marry the two elements, as seen by the critical receptions to The Young Victoria (2009, Jean-Marc Vallee) or Anna Karenina (2012, Joe Wright). Luhrmann does not allow that to happen with The Great Gatsby by highlighting the classic plight of romance between Gatbsy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Daisy (Carey Mulligan) specifically by keeping Callaways (Toby McGuire) perspective throughout, as the source material initiated. Hence, its by keeping the essential elements, Luhrmanns unconventional eye enhances a classic American take for an authentic remake of the classic love story.",1514419200,,1143,5.494318181818182

Leonardo DiCaprio play an older man who has basically wasted his entire life away on a girl who married for wealth and convenience within 6 mos. What a sad story and when they finally meet each other again (many years afterward), she choose the comfort and security of her horrible cheating, lying husband over her true love (The Great Gatsby-Leonardo Gatsby). So in other words, most women would choose staying in an unhappy marriage (as long as the money is good), over starting over and taking a chance with a new relationship that may fail (even with you true love that has spent a lot of money looking for you.

The biggest differece is, that the charakter of Jordan Baker is almost omitted. In the film Jordan Baker is a Golfplayer and one of Daisys closest friends. In the book however she has an affair with Nick and she plays a bigger role in the plot. There are some other deviations in the plot, but the one that I struggel most with, is Daisy. In the book is a scene, where Daisy plays really short with her little daughter. After that, the little girl is sent away with her nanny. In this scene you can see, that Daisy isn't loving her daughter like a mother should love her child. This is a huge insight into Daisys character, that is left completely out in the movie. In the movie you only see the perfect, innocent Daisy.
All in all, the Great Gatsby was a good novel to read and a really good movie to see.",1505001600,,1053,4.27

All of the story content that truly mattered was removed from this film.  While I vastly prefer Carey Mulligan's portrayal of Daisy to Mia Farrow's flighty take on the character, the old film is superior.  I generally like Leonardo DiCaprio, but he gives nothing to the role of Gatsby.  Does he have an accent?  Should I be taking a drink every time he says ""old sport""?  Don't worry, there's at least one quintessential Leo DiCaprio violent shouting incident in here (I think he's contractually-obligated to have one per movie).  Tobey Maguire apparently took an acting lesson from Keanu Reeves for this role - ""I'm just going to look befuddled.  Like, all the time.""  The roles of Myrtle and George Wilson are absolutely wasted.  They may as well have been left out of the movie.  Don't even get me started on the soundtrack (damn you, Baz Luhrman).  In all seriousness, do yourself a favor and read the book.  I was required to read it in high school and thought it was boring as hell.  14 years later, I read it again on a whim and finally recognized why the novel is considered a masterpiece.

The film did not need to be over two hours long, there were too many theatrics and titanic-like filler which weren't necessary. Honesty I do not think DiCaprio was right for the part, nor the actress who played daisies character. There wasn't enough mystery either and it was apparent this version was made to appease the masses, not for those of a particular taste. The music was cringe worthy, didn't fit the movie at all, thrown in to appease the masses once again. The ending was disappointing, all fluff, no sincerity.

The actors are all very good, but the direction is silly, unreal. It doesn't feel like these people are living in the 20's. It feels like they are actors pretending to live in the 1920's. Makes it hard to get into the story.
However, the chemistry between the narrator and Gatsby (Toby Maguire and DeCaprio) is so warm, and Gatsby so tragic... the acting partially redeems the film. Perhaps they should have hired a different director to go along with this amazing cast.",1487808000,,586,4.699029126213592

4963598,3,B0067EKYS6,"On the surface, Luhrmanns _Gatsby_ embodies a typical vision of the Roaring 1920s: the flash and the glitter, the reckless opulent abandon of the rich, and (if only very briefly) the grimy, ashy misery of the urban poor and working-class. Ultimately, though, the movie is too cool, too dizzying to have real depth. At various moments, I found myself simultaneously bored and bombarded by visual stimuli. Too often, Fitzgeralds words, when translated to the screen, go down subtly as a glass of gin. I enjoyed the Nick-as-author structure of the film (obviously an homage to the book, with a sanatorium twist), but Im not a purist for book-to-film adaptations. I would have preferred some artistic license instead of verbatim words, which, when articulated in the voice-over, carry scant traces of Fitzgeralds stylistic beauty and simplicity. In addition, the anachronistic soundtrack alone does not bridge the gap between a bygone Jazz era and our own; and the CGI is distracting enough to make my eyes long for real objects, backdrops, and landscapes. The green light canand should?be a digital illusion, but at least give Gatsby a real ocean that lets him contemplate the vastness of his/our own vanity.

Beyond its lack of subtlety (do viewers really need Dr. Ecklebergs heavy-handed symbolism? I dare to think that Gatsbys viewers are more intelligent than the filmmaker gives them credit for, whether or not theyve actually read the original book), the film is not invested enough in the flaws of its characters. I never felt the bright, empty melancholy of American materialism, the sparkling promise and tragic doom of the American dream, lived out by the actors on screen. The good news is that the film has edge and excess; the bad news, that it never fully unsheathes the knife to dig deep into a convincing emotional core. For instance, here Tom Buchanan is not the racist, ruthless, philandering, arrogant, upper-crust brute that he could be. Joel Edgerton does a fine job, but I didn't despise his Tom enough by the end. Likewise, DiCaprios Gatsby is not what I expected, for good and ill. Though he seems a little too old to play the seeker of the grail, DiCaprio finds the cracks in Gatsbys well-kept persona and convincingly lays them bare for the audience. However, if he is indeed a crime lord with pure intentions, then let the contradiction be even more pronounced. Give him free reign for ruthlessness, naivet, foppery, confidence, passion, vulnerability, infinite hopeuntil we see him, as through Nicks eyes, larger than life and somehow free from blame or scorn.

Daisy remains a major source of disillusionment. The scene where we are introduced to Daisy offers a promising start: Windows open to the patio and the gold of late afternoon. Long, beautiful, floating white curtains whipped by the breeze. A disembodied hand emerging from behind a white fainting couch. But where the camera should linger, where the room should bask in that airy languidness, Nicks voice-over resumes, and Daisy appears all too suddenly in the flesh. The moment is, after all, not a Moment. Mulligans Daisy is pretty; but where is the vain, ethereal, sad, unstable, potentially cruel and thoughtless woman with the thrilling voice that alters mens destinies? Our first glimpse of Daisy should be steeped in the auratic glow of a halo, the white-gold of an angel. Or of freshly-minted money. We should first see Daisy not necessarily as Nick sees her, but as Gatsby, the young yearning solider, once saw her, five years ago. But unlike Jay, we should soon realize her fragility, her inability to ever become the incarnation of a dream. What allure has this demure Daisy, beyond her dark doe eyes, glittering headbands, expensive fur shawls and flapper dresses?

I admit that Ive never been a fan of Toby Maguire (nothing personal), but once again I was disappointed with his performance. Whether this was due to the actor, the direction, or the script, I cannot say. But Nick Carraway should be jaded even before the narrative begins. In place of a shrewd detachment, lonely aimlessness, and post-war apathy that slowly blossoms into admiration and disgust, we get a slightly clueless Nick who lacks the keen sense of irony as the storys narrator. While I find Gatsby and Nicks chemistry more affecting than the Gatsby-Daisy romance (their farewell scene stands out in my mind as a highlight), Nick is far too visible as a narrator. Instead of fading in and out of the readers consciousnessthe same way he fades in and out of his own lifehis presence is innocently obtrusive. We know that _The Great Gatsby_ is Nicks book; but it must also go beyond him to capture the spirit of his own age while somehow speaking to our own generation.

When the film takes a breath between its orgiastic feasts for the eyes and its strange, pop-modern assault on the ears, it whispers of things that might have been. But as last shots are fired and the green light glimmers, this _Gatsby_ falls short of greatness. Such an outcome may or may not be so different from the fate of the American Dream.",1486598400,,5086,4.924242424242424

4963769,5,B0067EKYS6,"I was initially resistant, as I love the 1974 screenplay. I teach The Great Gatsby to high school students. I was, however, quickly won over in spite of a few minor issues. Amazing production value, sumptuous visuals, and some wonderful casting make this movie well worth seeing. It's also fairly true to the book, Duesenberg aside. The framework of Nick at a sanitarium sometime after the events of the novel works well, and the shortcut with regard to Tom and George also works.

While I loved the cast in general, for me the stand-out performances came from Elizabeth Debicki as Jordan, who seemed to walk right out of the pages of the book, and Joel Edgerton, who played a very human Tom... which is difficult to do, perhaps, given the character's shortcomings. DiCaprio transformed himself well, as he often does, and played a much better Gatsby than I imagined he might. That smile!

First, I believe I have seen other versions of this movie in the past, and never liked ANY of them. Yet with this variation of the story, I feel that I really came to appreciate what the author may have originally being trying to express: a man haunted by a dream, a love, a vision, a hope...but all gone so terribly wrong.

Baz Luhrman is one of my favorite all-time directors, if not my absolute favorite, and I do wish very much that he would make more films. He has a way with music, costumes, sets, design, and just setting an overall mood that may be unparalleled.

The acting is excellent, the casting quite fine...and so why the one star?

Because Hollywood always has to ruin a movie by cursing God, and I am quite tired of dealing with a long string of movies that I can never watch again because the director had to be obnoxious and throw those words in.

So, while I do hope that Baz Luhrmann will make more films.... please keep the cursing God OUT - so that I can give the films FIVE STARS!",1482451200,,1132,4.222222222222222

Honestly, I know this film cost them millions to make, but I am so sick of classic stories being turned into mush.

4964275,5,B0067EKYS6,"The Great Gatsby is a classic film which attacks the idea of new money and old money head on all while being consumed in Art Deco glory. Through this film, we follow Nick through his journey in the world of new money. He buys a house in East Egg; directly opposite of his cousin, Daisy Buchannans estate located on the West Egg. His house may be small, but its juxtaposed next to a Gatsbys grand mansion. Soon Nick and Gatsby become friends and Gatsby divulges a heart-wrenching secret to Nick. Nick then realizes its up to him to help Gatsby achieve his goal of winning back the one that got away.
The director, Baz Luhrmann, revamped the original 1974 Great Gatsby to fit the modern age. Both of which were derived from Scott F. Fitzgeralds, The Great Gatsby. In the 2013 version, every aspect from the soundtrack to the way of which the camera filmed had a modern touch to it. The opening scene is fast paced suiting to the 1920s lifestyle. Small clips of the stock market, alcohol production and bustling city life flash across the screen telling the story of the 1920s. Nick narrates as a mix of Jay-Zs 100$ Bill and No Church in the Wild plays over the clips. This brought an edgy, more modern portrayal of the 1920s. The heavy hip hop beat clashes with the jazzy vibe to appeal to a younger more modern audience.
Another way Luhrmann appealed to the younger audience was the way of which he filmed the parties. Nick narrates and says In the summer of 1922the parties were bigger, the shows were broader, the morals were looser and the ban on alcohol had backfired, making the liquor cheaper. Luhrmann took this quote and made it his own inspiration. Each of the parties filmed were over the top. The scenes were full of actors, decorations were everywhere and details were not overlooked. All these aspects came together to make the viewer feel like they were engulfed into the party.
The last way Luhrmann revamped this classic is through his choice of actors. Viewers were able to familiarize Fitzgeralds characters with familiar faces. Leonardo DiCaprio became Jay Gatsby and made viewers fall in love with his pretentious yet caring virtue, while Toby Maguire became the quiet, youthful and dazzled young man who we identified with. These two characters contrasted so well that they made a perfect connection in the viewers mind and allowed for the story to flow evenly.
In the 1974 movie, the film was not as bright and appealing as the 2013 film was. This is due to the lack of modern technology in film. The camera was simply aimed straight onto the characters while Luhrmanns camera became one with the actors. He was able to surround the actors and capture them in such a way that they became real people that the viewer felt like they could reach out and touch. Suddenly the film took on a 3D effect which did not make the viewer feel nauseated.
Although I favor the newer version more, I will still give some credit to the 1974 version. Yes, it was directed in a very similar way as the 2013 version; and yes, it did address the important concepts, but it was lacking the glamour and dazzle my mind desired. Throughout the film I felt flat. I was simply watching actors on film, not experiencing the situation among them. This was because they did not fit my imaginary portrayals of the characters I created from reading the book. I did not feel like the 1974 actors had the same passion and dedication to their characters as the 2013 cast did. This made it very difficult for my mind to allow me to be transported into the 1920s.
Scott F. Fitzgeralds, The Great Gatsby has been one of my favorite books I have ever read. His writing is so eloquently written and I was very excited to see both film adaptations of the book. I had very high expectations of what I wanted the film to address. I believe there are quite a few main concepts that need to be expanded on to create the story. If I were to rate which film did a better job of expressing these concepts, I would have to give the award to Luhrmann. His film was by far more expressive of the ideas and atmosphere that Fitzgeralds book contained that it was almost like Luhrmann took the scenes running through my mind while reading and turned it into a movie, and I believe this is a very important aspect that only great films can achieve.",1478563200,,4315,4.540436456996149

4964531,1,B0067EKYS6,"Too keep it short, I found the soundtrack so distracting I couldn't enjoy the movie. Everything about the movie, from its setting and ambiance, to its costumes, prohibition-era speakeasies and transatlantic accents screams 1920's America. But the music, and only the music, was so anachronistically out of step it became an irritation to the point of distraction. I don't mind anachronism; I enjoy the new Sherlock Holmes movies, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and so on, this movie just didn't mesh with me. Far prefer the '74 version, or, better yet, the book.

4964536,3,B0067EKYS6,"This version of The Great Gatsby was more exciting and visually appealing than the one with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. That said, it still lacked character depth. The best performance in the entire production came from Joel Edgarton who played Tom Buchanan (Daisy's narcissistic, self preening husband). Everything Joel Edgarton does is fantastic. Everyone else? Mis-cast. Lol

I like Leonardo DiCaprio, but I don't feel he chooses his roles well. He is not the actor who can play everything... there are very few who can (Kevin Spacey, Kate Blanchett, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Russell Crowe come to mind as master actors who can play everything), so Gatsby was not a good fit for him. I could see a Jude Law as a better fit. Same for Toby McGuire. Good actors... not great actors. This movie needed great actors to pull it off.

His acting is as good as ever, but (someone) who didn't have enough experience, muddied up the background...and many speaking lines were unable to hear clearly.

4964850,2,B0067EKYS6,"Read the book several times, and enjoyed the somewhat dark  Alan Ladd movie of 1949, and recently caught the Robert Redford version. I'm not sure what Baz Luhrmann had in mind with the Di Capprio version, but for this viewer the tone came off almost as cartoonish. I must say I wasn't happy at the outset because the video was front loaded with 20 minutes of upcoming garbage I had no use for. I knew something was wrong with the Di Capprio version when I started laughing at the wrong time, especially when I started hearing rap music in party segments. I'm for diversity, but I'm also a fan of authenticity.

4964883,5,B0067EKYS6,"This film is far better than the original one with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow.  Leo is perfectly cast as Jay Gatsby, the most iconic character in modern American literature in my humble opinion.  He does a great job of enthusing the character with his personal brand of charm and style.  I think the choice of Carey Mulligan as Daisy is phenomenal.  That's the kind of girl you picture Daisy being played by.  She's terrific in how she expresses Daisy's personality of warmth mixed with cynicism at times.  Tobey Maguire does a nice job as Nick Carraway.  Many of his reactions are shared by the viewers, and he's a great voice for Fitzgerald's take on the events of that summer in the city.  This has been one of my favorite books since I first read it in high school.  If you've read the book, or even if you haven't I would highly recommend this version.

4965002,4,B0067EKYS6,"I saw the film when it first came out and did not like it very much.  I felt that some of the rap music did not connect well with what was transpiring on screen.  I did not like the digital Disneyesque look of Gatsby's mansion.

I did like the inserted scene of how Jay Gats would have gained the knowledge and deportment of the more worldly manners, speech, deportment of the very rich. The Internet or movies did not exist in the twenties for him to gain such knowledge.

Leonardo DiCaprio turns in a wonderful performance.  Carey Mulligan is not exceptionally interesting as Daisy but passable.  The strongest performance is Joel Edgerton as Tom.  He dominates the screen in each scene as the oafish and contemptuous Tom.

I bought the DVD because it was offered at an extremely reasonable price.

After watching it on the small screen, I enjoyed it more.  I already owned the early 70s version.  I find it overly long; but, Mia Farrow turns in a performance as the vapid and ethereal Daisy that is stellar and hard to excel.

The Great Gatsby is a difficult novel to dramatize on film.

4965058,3,B0067EKYS6,"Suffice to say that there still isn't a ""great"" Great Gatsby film. Each version seems to be missing something or does not go as deep into the novel as it should. Most people who didn't like this version prefer the Robert Redford version, but I didn't really care for that one, as it was a little too tedious. I'm a little more partial to the 2000 version, but, once again, this one is barely 90 minutes and really does not go in depth into who Gatsby is. The most recent version is very big on dazzle, style, and eye candy, but overblown to the point of tedium and nausea. It really comes across as a superficial and dazzling ball of nothing at points.  Moreover, the characters say the lines from the various characters, but there really isn't much meaning to them. I should have known, with Baz as the director, what I would be getting. However, somehow with Romeo and Juliet, it worked. And I liked Moulin Rouge as well. It took guts to take on The Great Gatsby, and the visuals are impressive, but, when you really just get down to the core storytelling and characters for this novel, there isn't a lot there. Plus, there are some scenes that are excruciatingly and unnecessarily long, yet still manage to be rather weak in depth. Also, I found Toby McGwire's narration rather annoying, and there are many points that they dumb down the novel to a version of CliffNotes. In the end, this version is visually stunning, but mostly it like a big fancy box with very little substance inside.",1467849600,3,1491,4.522222222222222

The fellow was prissy, maudlin, awed by wealth and status and unattractive, all of which comes across clearly in his writing. Turning his books into films presents huge challenges. Luhrman's approach was to embrace Fitzgerald's excesses and try to do him one better, using the tools available to modern filmmakers. It doesn't work. The orgy of glitz and effects in the party at the mansion, for example, make it hard to take the film or Gatsby seriously. It's way too much. Ditto with the campy acting.

Seeing this impassioned, go-for-it acid trip of a literary adaptation for the second time with the American Lit class I was teaching, I was reminded again of the reasons why I like the film anyway. FIrst and foremost, Leonardo DiCaprio is a first-rate professional actor who works his craft deeply and you utterly feel it here. He knows the book, he has thought hard and caringly about the character, and he carries the film on his back like Atlas. Second--see sentence #3. This is a passionately imagined film that takes all kinds of risks with absolute conviction. There is an idea behind every shot. So I don't mind in the least that not all of the choices work for me. Lots of them do, and what doesn't work for me may really really work for the next person. Art! Gotta love the daring zest of this production. It's got the spirit.",1465862400,,1050,4.531578947368421

4965236,5,B0067EKYS6,"Alright. Lots of people complain about this version of The Great Gatsby, and I will at least concede that it's not perfect...but what film adaptation to a book is (Fight Club excluded)?

I'm an 11th grade English teacher, and I love love LOVE being able to show this version to my students because everyone loves Leonardo DiCaprio and the music transfixes them into the story line.

So, the cons first. (I'll try to do this without spoilers.) For die hard fans of the book (like me), I feel like Luhrmann screwed up the ending. I understand some of the choices he made (the father is absent from the film) but the newspaper bit annoys me because it gives people a reason for not showing up in the final event of the book.

And that is legitimately the only thing that bothers me about this film adaptation.

The pros:
Leonardo DiCaprio carried a copy of Trimalchio with him everywhere on set. Yes, this version of Gatsby is darker. Yes, Gatsby seems like much more of a gangster than in the novel The Great Gatsby. That's because he was. Fitzgerald's first attempt at The Great Gatsby was a novel called Trimalchio, in which Jay Gatsby is much darker and has much more of an ulterior motive when it comes to Daisy loving him. Even though some parts were changed in the final version of the novel, you can still pick up on that when you read Gatsby. The man is in the crime business for goodness sake, so anyone who complains that DiCaprio's version of Gatsby is too dark are probably the people who read Gatsby as a love story which (spoiler alert!) it's not.
The Great Gatsby is a book about how corrupt all people are, especially when it comes to obtaining money, and how the American Dream is an illusion that will always appear in front of us, but just like a mirage, disappears when we get closer to it. Fitzgerald HATED the rich and how easy they had it because that's the class he himself wanted to be in, and he never got there. He had a taste of it once, and then lost all his money.

The music is amazing, the story is great, and it's absolutely fantastic. If you're an English teacher who teaches Gatsby or just someone who really enjoys the story, buy or rent this!!
Also, buy Trimalchio.
Also, buy Maureen Corrigan's So We Read On.
Both of those books will give you a much deeper understanding of what Gatsby is.",1465171200,5,2325,4.448356807511737

For people unfamiliar with F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel and other film adaptations of it, this movie may have been a disappointment in terms of how it ended, perhaps because they were expecting an epic love story. In fact, in the book, the ""romance"" between Gatsby and Daisy is deliberately underplayed, it's more of an expose of the decadence and carelessness of the 1920s decade, and how the past simply cannot be recaptured, despite the actions that are taken in hopes of doing so. Baz Luhrmann's film does place a large amount of emphasis on the ""love story"" aspect, which may have led audiences to expect more than was ultimately delivered.

Not to say that this movie is not entertaining or good. It is, in many ways. Like other reviewers, I found the usage of hip-hop songs out of place, but luckily, the film does incorporate music that does seem to suit the era. Despite not being a period song, Lana Del Rey's ""Young And Beautiful"" works perfectly. The CGI does get a bit much at times, to the point where it looks unreal and a bit too much like animation, but it's still glorious to look at. I suppose that in a way, it was fitting as Fitzgerald was constantly describing light, natural and artificial, throughout ""The Great Gatsby"".

I can't think of another actor of the past few years who could have played Jay Gatsby other than Leonardo DiCaprio. While not a huge fan of the actor since my teenage years, there's no denying that he is a compelling presence on film. You believe that this self-made millionaire or whatever he was, achieved all that he did through blind ambition to win back his first love, Daisy (Carey Mulligan). I have to give Mulligan credit because Daisy is not an easy role to play, largely because the character was deliberately underwritten in the novel. There is a reason for this, because Daisy is idealized in Gatsby's eyes, as well as in the eyes of her cousin Nick Carraway (played here by Tobey Maguire, adequate but really nothing more), although to a lesser extent. Basically, Daisy is someone that others project their fantasies on to. Hence why I've never really believed that it was intended to be a love story, because it was not about real love, but trying to recapture the past, to achieve a dream and attempting to obtain the unobtainable. Gatsby does not truly love Daisy, but the image he had of her in his mind. Daisy, no matter what her feelings were for him could not simply walk away from her life; she was married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and had a child with him. The differences between old money and new money aside, there was no way that her husband would ever have let her go, and at some point, Daisy does realize this. Gatsby never does.

Elizabeth Debicki, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke and Amitabh Bachchan all do reasonably well in their under-developed roles. Luhrmann clearly was busy focusing on Gatsby and Daisy's relationship, but it's curious that despite the love scenes, which are well-acted and beautifully photographed, they exhibit little on-screen chemistry. The actors tried, but it never quite comes off. Ironically, there are far more sparks between Mulligan and Edgerton, in spite of the fact that Daisy is unhappy in her marriage and Tom is a brutish philanderer. The way Daisy and Tom look at each other, respond and react to one another says far more than any speeches, declarations of love or ""romantic moments"" with Gatsby. While some may feel that Edgerton over did it in portraying Tom's brash ways, he does show vulnerability, particularly when Gatsby starts pressuring Daisy to claim that she never loved her husband. I've never found Tom to be particularly sympathetic, but Edgerton manages to pull it off, as does Mulligan. Daisy as a character is much maligned but when push comes to shove, she was trapped in the high-society mindset into which she was born, and never pretended to be anything she was not. It was Gatsby who refused to accept reality, and this what ultimately led to his downfall. In fact, even when Gatsby tells Nick about his past, we can't even be entirely sure he is telling the truth, as he is so prone to fantasy. We are also not sure as viewers what was inside Daisy's heart and mind, perhaps she loved both men, but had to make the choice that was best for her, but not without consequences.

The costumes and sets will literally take your breath away, but the exclusion of a few crucial scenes (one of which does show up in the deleted scenes section of the special features of the DVD) may have helped to clear some things up.

It's not my favorite film adaptation of the novel but it's not as terrible as some are making it out to be.",1458691200,5,4691,4.673123486682809

4966019,4,B0067EKYS6,"Every year my American Literature students study The Great Gatsby.  This year they read small parts of the novel, and then watched the whole 1974 version (with Robert Redford.)  I then show parts of the new version for comparison.
In general, the students like the newer version better, which is not a surprise.  It is much more vibrant and moves along better.
When I first watched the movie, I was annoyed with the modern music.  As I watch it more and more, I can understand the reason for the modern music, but I still don't think it fits the era (of course.)  However, many of my students feel that it allows young people to better relate to the movie and catches their attention more.
  I have never liked how Gatsby is introduced in this version.  Having the character say, ""I'm Gatsby,"" and then have fireworks is just unnecessary.  Many of my students agree with me on that.
The thing that both my students and I agree upon is the depiction of the deaths of both Myrtle and Gatsby.  If the director really felt that showing Myrtle's death was necessary (even though the actual accident is not described other than the car that hit her didn't stop and what her body looked like after she was hit), having her fly over the car in slow motion with the glass flying around her made it seem nearly ""Matrix-like, which is really silly"" and ""overly dramatic,"" (Students' words....not mine.)  I think those are accurate descriptions. Having Gatsby whisper ""Daisy"" before he dramatically falls into the pool is the same thing.  Slow motion is rarely needed in a movie such as this.
However, DiCaprio's depiction of Gatsby, although different from Redford's, is very good.  It is interesting to see how each plays the character, and I think they are both good.
Next year I plan to have my students read the entire novel and then watch just this newer version.  It will be interesting to see what they think.",1458259200,4,1905,4.647761194029851

4966292,5,B0067EKYS6,"Everyone has their opinions and to me that is what a review is, a person's opinion of the movie they watch. So, this is my personal opinion of what I thought of The Great Gatsby.

I purchased this movie because I love watching it. It's one of those movies I can watch over and over again and find new things that I like about it. The music, the plot, the characters, all things I love about the movie. The costumes are exquisite. I think what I love about the movie most is that if a person really watches the movie, you can relate to Jay and Dixie's relationship. A love lost, rekindled, and then a tragic end to it all. I think what really got to me about the movie is Tom's role in it all. Knowing Dixie married him because of his place in society, cheating on her was ok, and then to make sure her happiness was taken away, essentially framing the true love of her life to take the fall for everything bad that happened. Kind of - it's ok if a man cheats, but if a woman does, there is hell to pay thinking. Funny how one man went to the ends of the Earth to get to her while the other only cared when someone took notice of her.

I love the movie. Plain and simple. This is my short review because this movie has been reviewed a lot, so why repeat what others think? If you do not like my review, feel free to say why as I am always looking to improve my reviews.",1455926400,,1368,4.044280442804428
4966293,4,B0067EKYS6,Would be a better film if the music at the parties had been actual 1920's style. Weird to hear current style music for a 1920's era.....,1455926400,,136,4.269230769230769

4966356,5,B0067EKYS6,Genius. Absolutely loved it. Brought the book and story-line to life in a powerful way.,1455667200,,87,4.866666666666666
4966357,5,B0067EKYS6,"Most of the 1-star reviews stated that the movie was made for (paraphrasing here) shallow, non-literary airheads who don't have a long enough attention span or enough intelligence to read or appreciate deep works. So I'd like to say that I am pretty much the opposite of all those things and yet I loved this movie. Normally I wouldn't toot my own horn like I do here, but I want to defend those who enjoyed this movie from the unjust generalizations by those who didn't.

I love books and writing. Reading is my favorite pastime, and my favorite book is The Count of Monte Cristo. I was one of two people in my AP English class to get a 5, my mom was an English professor, and the only things I loved more than writing literary analysis papers in school were playing music and doing art. (The movie is HIGHLY artistic and that definitely influenced how much I enjoyed the movie.) I read Gatsby in high school, which is, like most required reading, not able to be fully appreciated at that age. I didn't like the book at the time, and I didn't remember it at all, but after seeing the movie I am now going to re-read the book. And I think that is the best reason to be able to say this is a good movie: when it makes you want to read the book! (Update in March 2016: I really enjoyed the book, and thought the writing was absolutely stunning for the settings/atmosphere, though for the characters too vague.)

I think the real prerequisites for enjoying this movie are simply being prepared for and liking the style of past similar movies by Baz Luhrmann, which are extremely visual and musical and ""over-the-top,"" and also perhaps not being wed to the book too much to be able to look past the changes Hollywood will always make to adaptations. Luhrmann's style did not overshadow the story for me in the least, but rather magnified it. After the movie was over, what stayed with me was not the visuals or the pageantry, but the story and the characters, primarily Gatsby's. I spent quite a bit of time thinking about everything that happened, and why. And I haven't been able to get the various expressions on Gatsby's face out of my mind in the days since seeing the movie: when he first sees Daisy again at the private tea, the ""understanding smile"" when Nick meets him for the first time, and so on. I'm not normally a huge Leo fan but he excelled in this movie. He was intense and passionate just as his character should be, and I was quite surprised at the 1-star reviews saying the acting was horrible.

As for the music, I love jazz and I am an amateur jazz and classical musician (saxophone, clarinet and piano). But I completely understand Baz' choice to represent it with today's music, to more closely capture for today's audience the wildness and raw joy that jazz evoked for people when it was the newest, hottest dance music of their time. (Wikipedia quotes music critics of the time describing jazz the way the 1-star reviewers described the movie: 'Despite its popularity, as a form of music Jazz was still not appreciated by many critics, including Anne Faulkner who passed off jazz as ""a destructive dissonance"", asking if the music ""put the sin in syncopation""and Henry van Dyke who described jazz as ""an unmitigated cacophony, a species of music invented by demons for the torture of imbeciles.') I think if jazz had been exclusively used instead of being intertwined and/or replaced with pop, it would have distanced the viewer quite a lot, both by feeling old-fashioned, and also because people just don't listen to jazz much now. Jazz is now the lowest-selling genre of music and is not nearly as appreciated today, especially not the earliest jazz.  Speaking of the music, although I LOVE ""Young and Beautiful"" by Lana Del Rey, it doesn't fit the story at all. But her song ""Without You"" fits perfectly. They should have used that instead!",1455580800,19,3865,4.605224963715529
4966358,5,B0067EKYS6,"The Great Gatsby is an amazing read that you have to read word-for-word to fully appreciate the story.

Also- the author was drunk when he first wrote the draft, that in itself is a huge accomplishment.",1455580800,,471,4.425287356321839

When I went back in to finish watching it, there was no option to finish watching, only to pay again to rent. This seemed like a bizarre version of Gatsby. The 1974 movie followed the book and I thought was much better at capturing the content and era. This new version was just plain bizarre. People who haven't seen the 1974 version, or younger people who know nothing about the 20's and post war era will think that rap music was also a part of that era, when that is nowhere near the truth.

4966696,5,B0067EKYS6,"Not ever having read the 1925 novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, nor having
seen any of the previous film adaptations, I went into this viewing of The
Great Gatsby with an open mind and somewhat high expectations knowing
that it came from director Baz Luhrmann, the man responsible for one of
my favorite films, Moulin Rouge.

Speaking of Moulin Rouge, if you loved that film, most likely you are going
to adore The Great Gatsby, which has most all the same elements intact here
outside of the musical numbers.  It's a lavish production -- at times a theme park
ride -- complete with exhausting quick edits, spinning camera motions and
over-the-top party scenes populated by seemingly thousands of drunken guests.

Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) is an aspiring writer and Bonds salesman
who lives out in the country near his cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan) and her
rather volatile husband, Tom Buchanon (Joel Edgerton).  An invitation to a
party introduces Carraway to Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a millionaire who
pulls him into a world of bountiful luxury in hopes of a return favor that will
reunite the socialite with a lost love.

With so much emphasis placed on the film's visuals it becomes apparent
that if taken away, there isn't much of a story left to keep one engaged.
Furthermore, the audience never really has the opportunity to bond with
the characters to to really care what happens to them.

...but who cares?!  The film's exaggerated visuals depicting ""The Roaring
20s,"" amplified in glorious 3D, kept this viewer in a constant, hypnotic trance.
There is so much appreciation to be had for the complex world that Visual Effects
Supervisor Chris Godfrey has created for this film.  There's a tantalizing
sequence where Gatsby takes Carraway for a ride in a brilliant yellow 1929
Duesenberg.  The camera follows overhead as the car races through countryside
roads into the Manhattan Skyline.  The depth that 3D provides makes it look
like something out of a pop-up book, so beautiful and tantalizing to watch that
it nearly takes your breath away.  Luhrmann prefers to keep all the cool 3D
elements within the screen (rather than outside of it), with plenty of neat effect
touches that include floating champagne bubbles and thrown confetti. One of
the most interesting 3D effects was Gatsby shaking his cane.  That was perhaps
the one prop that came closest to protruding itself outward. The transfer is
immaculate as expected, with popping, vibrant colors and nice inky black levels.
None of the brilliant imagery was lost with active shutter eyewear.  Crosstalk was
slightly evident in some scenes near the beginning of the film, but it wasn't
frequent enough for it to be an issue.

The film's DTS-HD 5.1 soundtrack doesn't disappoint with its robust presentation
and underlying LFE that emphasizes the beat of the film's various hip-hop tracks
(yes you read that correctly) as well as selections from other popular contemporary
artists. The rears give support for the jazzy film score as well as providing ambience
for the party sequences and weather elements.

The Great Gatsby arrives as a 3-Disc (Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD/Ultraviolet)
package with a lenticular sleeve.  There are a wealth of extras that include
deleted scenes, trailers, and features on the sounds and fashion of the 20s
era.

The first question you must ask yourself is if you need to see The Great
Gatsby.  For fans of Baz Luhrmann and his stylish Moulin Rouge, this becomes
an easy film to admire.  Anyone looking outside of the visuals for a entertaining
story are going to somewhat disappointed.

If one is considering a 2D or 3D purchase of the Blu-ray, it is definitely worth
considering the latter.  The layers of depth that the 3D process provides really
augments the tantalizing visuals created for this film.  I could not imagine enjoying
The Great Gatsby as much without that added depth this presentation provides.",1453075200,,3910,5.0015432098765435

Unfortunately, the beginning (and even an hour in) felt very rushed and too cartoony at times.  I suppose that's part of the style, and a representation of the horrid gaudiness and falseness of many of the characters, however I didn't care for it.  I also didn't care that some of the dialogue was simplified to the point of changing cogitations, and that some of the greatest lines from the book were cut from the script (e.g. voice full of money). Probably the worst part though has got to be the soundtrack, especially for the parties.

the actresses are pretty cute (of course).
I felt the sound track was pretty cool, they would be walking into a speakeasy or club and the soundtrack would be Jay Z rapping, nice touch.
strong ending.
cool cars and nice mansions in this movie, if you appreciate things like that.

it took me a minute to get used to DiCaprio's accent in the beginning, but it ends up making sense when you learn more about his character.",1447891200,,692,4.7190082644628095

4967248,5,B0067EKYS6,"Great movie.
Its a modern portrayal of a movie/book that takes place in the 1920s. I love the casting. They weren't accurate to the characters from the original book but they were casted in a way so we could relate more to how that character was supposed to be viewed when the book was written. For example, Daisy ""the golden girl"" with a voice that sounds like money as Nick, her cousin and the story's narrator, describes her is originally dark haired in the book but cast as a blonde in this movie or Wolfsheim being an Middle Eastern man instead of the original Jewish character.
To make it more modern, Gatsby's parties are absolutely huge and over the top. Its very unlikely that the way Fitzgerald imagined the parties was anything like they are in this movie portrayal but this is exactly how one would imagine a Gatsby party in this decade.
Having read the book long before watching the movie, I am a bit disappointed that certain scenes weren't in this movie. Personally, I believe that one scene that would have made this movie is the scene where Gatsby actually meets Daisy's daughter that would have been right before the plaza scene. At this point in the book, Gatsby slowly starts to realize that he hasn't actually had any contact with Daisy in the five years they've been apart. She's been with another man and this little girl right in front of him is literal proof of that and even if Daisy doesn't love Tom anymore, she loved him enough to have a child with him. He's slowly starting to realize that maybe this (him and Daisy) won't work but he's so stuck on this idea of having Daisy that he won't openly admit it until he snaps on Tom at the plaza. Daisy, herself, admits that she loved (past tense) them both and even then he doesn't directly admit that hes starting to lose hope. The scene also brings into question, what would Gatsby do about Pammy, Daisy's daughter, if Daisy had chosen him in the end? Would he bring her into his home and life too? Or would he leave her with Tom? Would he want to raise his ""enemy's"" kid? Overall, I think that this scene could have given the movie that extra boost to make it one of the best movies that came from a book.",1441843200,,2183,4.432835820895522
4967249,3,B0067EKYS6,"Lavishly produced film about an odd, obsessive love story between a mysterious and obscenely rich man and his lost love.

4967705,1,B0067EKYS6,"Whatever this is, it isn't The Great Gatsby. Luhrman drains all intimacy from the novel and replaces it with unnecessary dialogue that overstates the themes, plot points and character motivations at every turn.  It is as if a teenager stoned out of his mind heard about the story of the Great Gatsby from someone who only read the Cliffs Notes in high school 20 years ago and then decided to turn it into a film 20 years after that.  Luhrman clearly was given a lot of money, but there is little to show for it.  The story is edited and rearranged to the point of being unrecognizable and devoid of any real emotional impact.  I feel sorry for anyone who thinks that this is in anyway representative of Fitzgerald's novel. Every character is completely wrong in characterization and tone, starting with Nick who is confused here with Holden Caulfield reminiscing from an asylum. Gatsby is confused with the titular character from Citizen Kane, bombastic, ostentatious and always on the edge of control.  The rest are an unfortunate mix of extras from some hackneyed WB show, vapid and underdeveloped.  Luhrman, despite a big budget, is not even able to capture the spirit or elegance of the Roaring 20s, as it is all buried under his frenetic camera that reads Millennial pill party, not hedonistic flappers swimming in the wake of the nouveau riche.  I could go scene by scene but needless to say, it's not in any way close to or satisfying as the novel. And finally halfway through, I realized that Luhrman was not making Gatsby but was remaking Citizen Kane, which would have made more sense with Luhrman's over the top style and use of modern music (which, btw, was surprisingly the least problematic part of this movie).  Unfortunately, the most careless people involved in this version of the story were the producers and director.",1435104000,,1837,4.791139240506329

This is a huge, gorgeous, Technicolor comic book rendering of the story that puts all writers to shame (since we know we can never top it)!  Baz Luhrmann was born to bring Gatsby to life. He ""gets out of the way"" of the prose by not taking it (or himself) too seriously, and by doing so, the weight of the words speak for themselves.  The ""Rhapsody in Blue"" sequence is nothing short of breathtaking.  YES it's over the top -- exactly how Gatsby would have wanted it.

Some of the things that were different is how the book described Myrtel as a not pretty just an attractive women but she was actually pretty and attractive. Another difference was that the movie added a little of simple extra things with the characters reactions. And at the end of the book after Gatsby's death, his father came to his funeral but he did not in the movie. The similarities were much more than the differences because the movie was pretty close to the book and had almost everything that the book has. The movie had the places where the events happened the West Egg, East Egg and the city. The characters also said some quotes that were in the book. It described the characters exactly how they were in the book. Also the same events happened such as the death of Myrtel and the affairs between Tom and Myrtle, and Daisy and Gatsby.

4967857,4,B0067EKYS6,"When this movie was released the reviews were all over the place and when I watched the trailer I couldn't imagine a film about the 1920s with the music of today---loud, raucous, and certainly not the jazzy era feel.  But I found that I actually liked this film.  There was a lot of raw basic elements in it that I didn't remember from the 1972 version because the Redford/Farrow film was more romanticized.  This one vilified the character of Jay Gatsby even more.  He was reckless, excessive, secretive, deceptive, and a man who always got what he wanted except the woman he loved.

Toby McGuire as Nick Carroway  was the narrator.  This movie placed him in a sanitarium as a recovering alcoholic---almost like it was F. Scott Fitzgerald putting himself in that place.  And he's told by the psychiatrist to write down all his experiences as he tells his story of his acquaintance with Jay Gatsby and who he really was and how he made an impact on him.  McGuire captured the innocence and then downfall of the bright young Yale graduates trying to make money selling bonds on Wall Street before the big crash---kind of a juxtaposition to today's world!

Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role was good but his accent didn't quite stand up, but maybe that was intended since Gatsby was pretending to be someone that he really wasn't.  He tries to disguise his roots in the beginning but it soon falls apart.  There is also more references and flashbacks to the earlier Gatsby looking dashing in uniform before he goes to war.

Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan nailed it!  The look of helplessness, vulnerability, and being a slave to a philanderer but wealthy husband was well done.  She's really the victim here but doesn't know it and continues to play the privileged, protected wife who wanted something more in Jay Gatsby but was just too impatient and spoiled to wait.

The sets, costumes, and graphic features were well done.  It's evident that the special effects and designs of films these days have come a long way!",1431388800,,2021,4.728571428571429

On the other hand, the reason why I didn't give it a full five stars is because the rest of the actors weren't cast right.

The music I thought was fantastic and just really set the scene better than the jazz of the 20's could.  The 20's were a sexual and moral revolution after WWI and that hard sound brought out the grittier side of the 20's.  WWI was such a devastating time for the world,1/3 of the male population  of the world died in this war.  Those who survived were ready to party.  I liked the visual impact and the fantasyland like air of Gatsby's mansion.  I really don't know why this picture got such a bad wrap.  I think this version holds up with the Robert Redford version.  Which is  good but not spectacular.  I think this was better than that version in the depth of the acting.  But always  this book is going to be really hard to film.

The film attempts to be a period piece using the latest digital effects to create an accurate 1920s New York.  While they succeed in seamlessly creating this backdrop, the producers insist on a PC inclusion of a hip-hop soundtrack that is simply all wrong and terribly distracting.

The set up, music, dialog, additional scenes...it's all wrong.  After 20 minutes, I turned it off.  (I didn't get far enough to see Leonardo DiCaprio's performance.  Why bother?  But I can say that Tobey Maguire is terrible in the role of Nick. His narration grates on the senses.)

My recommendation is to read the book, then watch the Robert Redford version of ""The Great Gatsby.""  Francis Ford Coppola wrote the screenplay.  He was meticulously faithful to the source material.  As I recall, the film received mixed reviews when first released.  But time has been kind.  Mia Farrow's performance is spot on.  It's incredibly close to the way the character is written in the book.  And Redford is terrific.  The casting in the 1974 version really is perfect.  It may not have the wiz-bang digital effects of this 2013 debacle, but it certainly is more accurate in bringing the book to the screen.

When compared side by side, 1974's version wins hands down.",1423785600,,1490,4.768627450980392

From the initial screen to the last credits, this movie is a complete failure.  The art deco frame on the initial screen overpowers the information it surrounds.  There is HIP HOP music in a 1920's Charleston era film! The dancing sucks and the crowd scenes are filled with people who don't look at all like people of the era.  The supporting characters are extremely poorly developed and in some cases so wooden that they might as well be mannequins. It is not the fault of the actors, it's the terrible script and direction that they were subjected to. The stage set looks like something concocted by Disney, not at all like a 1920's mansion.  Even DiCaprio's character is only marginally believable.  And to top it all off, the DVD is encrusted with 8 or 9 previews.  Again, save your money for an earlier version, e.g. with Robert Redford.

It jumps around like a Family Guy episode on fast forward.  Your retinas will never be the same after you behold the eyeball searing sets that look like Walt Disney threw up on them after a Kool-Aid acid test.

Just to make sure no one would have to think too hard, Luhrmann rewrote Fitzgerald's elegant prose in the narration so that now it sounds like it went through an Microsoft Word auto-correct for grammar. It's as clear as hospital broth and just as tasteless.  Did he think he was improving the story? The allure of Gatsby is in the poetic prose.  It's a beautiful, heartbreaking story about very shallow people.  It's a tragedy about people who conflated the trappings of achievement with achievement itself.

I have read the book many times, and even studied it in my AP English class, and I have seen the other versions of the film, but none add up to the book as well as this adaption. The new contemporary soundtrack, with jazz undertones adds a more illuminating and jarring tone to the movie, while the stellar acting brings the emotions that the Robert Redford version greatly lacked. The costumes were fantastic. Though everything was over the top, this was an artistic interpretation that I feel reflected the Jazz Age as a whole, very realistically, as well as adds to the mystery and hugeness of Gatsby himself. The point is Gatsby is over the top. The Jazz age is over the top. In both bad and good ways, this is how people became disillusioned with the Jazz Age as a whole, how they became sick of the people, and the sounds, and the money. Gatsby is a reflection on that through love and the American Dream. Honestly this adaption showcased that so well, as other have failed to do.",1420243200,4,1022,4.52972972972973

I found t difficult to follow which forced me to watch it several times to figure it out and I'm still not sure I know why the guy is in an insane asylum. It's a little strange playing rap music in a period film way before rap music was invented. I guess that was an attempt to modernize and attract a younger viewer. At times this movie slows to a crawl at other times the cuts are so quick you cant see anything. They had a chance to make a great film here and blew it. Not the actors fault in my opinion it was the plot itself who is at fault as well as the direction and editing. There's a lot of things going on that aren't explained thus do not make sense.

I remember seeing the 1974 version with Redford, which was underwhelming, but with performances that at least stuck in my mind.  I can't say that about this one.  Maybe it's my age and preferences.  But, really, the behind the scenes folks here changed the Gatsby story so much that it is no longer the Gatsby story.

4968781,3,B0067EKYS6,"First half impressions:
Buhrman applies the same meandering, gen-next pandering schizophrenic approach to ruining a classic as he did to Shakespeare, by way of ""modernising it"" ie. destroying the intent, feel and meaning of the original work.
At least the orchestral soundtrack is nicely worked.
I would've preferred to see something with the same production values but retaining the pace and intelligence of the book. Sadly, nothing is available in film form. This is the best we can get. Unfortunate, sad, and a devastating commentary on the expected intelligence of the movie-going populace in this day and age. Making the visuals match the style of the times while altering the musical and video-editing epoch to such a high degree gave a jaded, undereducated feeling to the entire ensemble. The acting is good, toby mcguire does his thing, leonardo dicaprio does his thing, but in Burhman's filmns, actors are little more than props in a visual story, his effervescent sherbet fizz version of a film.

Second half impressions:
By the second half Buhrman slows the pace down and it approaches being a normal, contemporary film and a good depiction of the novel. It is unfortunate that he felt the need to hook the audience in with what they expected of him from previous films in the first half. It shows a lack of faith in the audience. More space is given to the actors to actually act in the second half, and the editing slows down long enough to show actual story rather than filigree. The music becomes more appropriate while remaining touches of contemporary work remain. I'm glad he actually managed to show some emotion in this half of the film. The characters develop some depth and become human. I'm happy I watched this half with exception to the two moments of stylised violence that felt emotionally out-of-place with the resonance of the portrayed situation.",1415750400,,1876,4.955555555555556

4968901,5,B0067EKYS6,"This version of The Great Gatsby is the rarest of all movie birds, a heartbreaking human drama that has achieved a mass audience.  This rendition of the F. Scott Fitzgeralds American classic novel was written by Baz Luhrmann (also directed by Baz also produced by Baz).  Luhrmann has a history of handling the writing and directing tasks in his projects.  Movie buffs will remember his 2008 attempt at a big screen epic with Australia and the 2001 Moulin Rouge.  The Great Gatsby is a vastly superior film.  Luhrmann takes enormous pains in even the smallest things in his direction, which we notice in the opening credits which are sort of a grand, opulent Art Deco statement-to an early scene where a writing instrument is just perfect.
 The casting is also brilliant.  Tobey Maguire plays the movies narrator, Nick.  Maguire is the classic odd man out and fits the Nick character exactly.  Carey Mulligan is the leading lady, a married woman named Daisy Buchanan.  He husband is the odious Tom Buchanan played with a vacuous brutality by Joel Edgerton.  The naive, driven, obsessive and mysterious Jay Gatsby is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in perhaps his greatest role yet, certainly his most complex.
 For those who missed the novel in American Literature in 11th grade, like me, the story is of lost love.  Gatsby and Daisy fall hard for each other just before Jay leaves for the French front in WWI.  After the war he builds a fabulous fortune in order to be respectable match for Daisy in the eyes of her well to do parents-but neglects to inform Daisy who naturally moves on.  Sadly, she moves on to a rich but empty man with no discernable morals.  Gatsby returns with a determination to recapture Daisy.  We know this cant have a happy ending but we want desperately for that outcome.
 There are many wonderful things about this movie.  Music Director Craig Armstrong is responsible for a temporal mix of old and current music that shocks but works.  The scenes of Gatsbys parties are colorful, complex and the very emblem of the kind of decadence that made the Roaring Twenties famous.  And the characters travel back and forth from Big Egg to Manhattan through the bad lands of working class New York in a surrealistic satire of the social classes.  Wow.
 This is as close to perfect as movie making gets.  Fans who want a major production geared for adults who appreciate true drama, excellent acting and world class direction, this is it.  This is a five saw blade movie with a PG-13 rating.  It lasts two hours and 23 minutes.
 Fun fact, The Great Gatsby was filmed in Australia which saved the producers tens of millions of dollars.  With those savings the $105 million actually spent will likely be returned.  Projections are for a $50 million opening weekend.",1413331200,,2777,4.763102725366877

4968942,5,B0067EKYS6,"THE GREAT GATSBY - the compelling novel by Author: F.Scott Fitzgerald, is brought to the motion picture screen in a larger than life way. The year is 1922 and the pomp and circumstance of the 'Roaring Twenties' combined with the supremely wealthy but enigmatic GREAT GATSBY, is flawlessly portrayed by Academy Award winning Actor - Leonardo DiCaprio. Within this powerful story of generosity, obsession and sacrifice to the point of death, in order to rekindle a former romance with a woman that he just couldn't get out of his heart or mind. That being: Daisy - a bored, selfish, indulgent, self-centered, spoiled, immature, self-absorbed, woman, who behaved as though she was a little girl within a woman's body, who just happened to have been long since married and a mother to boot. And, not only married..., but married to a flamboyant husband with an immense fortune of his own, who was repeatedly unfaithful to her. But, deep within her being, she for the most part was a gold-digger who after having sold herself out in marriage for the finances, creature comforts and ultra luxurious lifestyle, conveniently turned her head at her cheating husbands, numerous marital indiscretions. Bored out of her mind and ungrateful with her life of leisure, she is not in the least bit inconvenienced when her former lover THE GREAT GATSBY... reappears, and woes and pursues her with extravagant abandon. In hopes, of making her his own by marital commitment. Flattered by the attention, she sends out mixed messages... by accepting the flowers, gifts, clothing, parties, dinner invitations, the romantic innuendos, the secret rendezvous, passionate love-making and the enticing allure of it all. She even agree's to divorce her unfaithful husband in favor of THE GREAT GATSBY - or so she said..., when she was alone with him. Who by now, was hopelessly in love with her to the point of idolatry, that bordered on obsession. But, when he wanted to go public with their affair by confronting her husband by petitioning him with the divorce papers, she backed down. She did have a daughter with him and in 1922, it wasn't easy for a woman to get a divorce, if at all. Regardless of how much money, she had. Never mind the fact, that the mega wealthy, GREAT GATSBY could afford to make it all happen, she still backed down and went back to her cheating husband. Because being innately selfish, scared and bound by her conceit and self-deceptive delusion, she got the attention that she craved. Especially since, she wanted the best of both world's from each of the men but only, at her beck and call. The little hussy, who was a passive aggressive, master manipulator and a ""damsel in distress"" control freak, knew just how to pit her husband against THE GREAT GATSBY, then sit on the sideline, as if she was so sweet and innocent. Hmm?! And for his part, they say that 'love is blind' but when the handwriting is on the wall, willful obsession and continued pursuit of a married woman who obviously toy's with and then outright rejects him, is foolishness and waste of time on his part. Because, if she cheats on her husband then eventually, she will ultimately cheat on him, too. Either that, or she'll continue to play while the getting is good, but when she tires of him, she has the luxury of going back to her husband. So, either way, it's his all around, loss. So, why bother? Perhaps, as a fellow human being, THE GREAT GATSBY has his flaws, as well. Again, just because he had the enormous riches to make his union with his beloved Daisy - happen, he forgot about one thing. That being: Her free will. She had a right too, love him and then, leave him. That was her choice. His choice was, that he would take a gamble on a married woman and lost. And, if her husband cheats on her..., then her cheating on him isn't a valid excuse for her infidelity. Why not? Because 'two wrong's' don't make a right! If a spouse is unfaithful and you don't want to forgive him or her and work towards healing your marital/sexual differences, then get a divorce. Afterwards, you can freely romance, live with or marry, whomever you wish. Minus all the sneaking around, only to end up with egg on your face when your married lover goes back to his or her own, spouse. Besides, why would you want someone who play's yo-yo with your mind, your heart and your body? Their terms, on their time, if and when they want to 'play' (make love) with and too, you? In the meantime, what are you supposed to do? Wave 'bye-bye' while he goes off on a family vacation with the wife and kids?? Wakey, wakey! Like, THE GREAT GATSBY... who was an active participant in an adulterous affair, he was setting himself up for disappointment and heartache. Because clearly, his 'significant other' was playing both sides of the field. The husband was for the socially accepted title of 'Mrs.' as well as, for the respectable position of 'wife.' Which sufficed for the pretentious appearances, as the happily married couple. Never mind, that they were living separate lives. THE GREAT GATSBY was for the secret, passionate, lovemaking, rendezvous sessions, extravagant spending spree's and all the romance that she could handle and indulged in. And although she privately shared her body with him, she had already predetermined that she was going to keep him on a leash. Especially since, she didn't think enough of him and had no intention of going public with their affair by divorcing her husband. ""I love you..., BUT!"" To her, it was play and fantasy time with THE GREAT GATSBY, but only on her terms and time. Whereas he thought that she truly wanted to be his. He didn't want to see that she was immature and selfish to the core, whose only ultimate regard for anyone's feelings, was for those of her own. Then, came the accident...! The fault and blame of which, fell upon THE GREAT GATSBY. He was innocent and she knew it, but let him take the blame for it, anyway.

4968944,1,B0067EKYS6,"A bizarre interpretation of a classic novel.  What would possess anyone to make a movie about a novel set in the Jazz Age and then avoid using any jazz music for the many, many musical numbers.  It is jazz that set the tone in the actual era and the book.  The movie is devoid of jazz.  It was like making a movie about football and where the football scenes should be you would have basketball scenes.  Probably not the worst movie ever made, but clearly in the running.  The movie did make some money, so some people must have liked it.",1412640000,7,538,4.2772277227722775

I decided to give it a go anyway, and I am glad I did! The music was modern, but I thought it made the movie. The party scene as Gatsby's mansion is spectacular. Of course the costuming was out of this world. And Leo, oh Leo, you were great. Truly. I also thought that Toby McGuire actually gave a very good performance as well, even though I am not a fan of him or his works in general. I think you have to watch this movie with a more open mind and remember that this is a Baz Luhrmann film. This is what he does. You can see his style carry from Romeo+Juliet and Moulin Rouge to here.

It was good to see these two childhood friends finally in a movie together.  I dislike the person they got to play Daisy.  I think she ruined the whole film for me.  Her acting was less than convincing.  Except when she wasn't talking.  Then she was believable.

The scenery is beautiful and the music is good albeit not fitting this type of movie.

Overall I preferred the original movie with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford.  Their performances were more memorable to me. I did not intend to purchase this film. Only wanted to rent it.

4969092,2,B0067EKYS6,"The Great Gatsby on film is always a disappointment, and I've puzzled over why this should be so.  The novel is a masterpiece of its kind, but the films never seem to really work.  The Robert Redford/Mia Farrow version made in the 1970's is more successful than this version and is certainly true to the book.  I think the character of Nick Carraway, as portrayed by Sam Waterston, anchors that film. The viewer likes him and trusts him. Redford was an okay Gatsby and Mia Farrow was a pretty believable Daisy

The Leonardo DiCaprio version is a disaster.  The casting is a mistake.  Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor, but he was a lousy Gatsby.  Some of this is not his fault.  The annoying and repetitive dialogue he had to speak would defeat any actor, but I could never buy into him as Gatsby.  His performance felt off and DiCaprio seemed uncomfortable throughout the film. Carey Mulligan is similarly miscast.  It is impossible to believe that she is a woman capable of making a man like Jay Gatsby pine for her for years to the extent that he reimagines his whole life for her.  And don't get me started about the disasterous way the movie  portrays Nick Carraway,  Far from being a bystander who observes and reports what is happening - he is front and center in all the action.  This mischaracterization of a pivotal character in the film is not just a deviation from the book, but it undermines the whole structure of the movie by taking away the only character who is potentially likeable in the film.

I've come to two conclusions about The Great Gatsby on film.  The first is that it is impossible to make a film of this book without the right actress as Daisy.  Though Gatsby is the center of the novel, on film, Daisy has to be convincing as a woman (fantasy) this man would build his entire life around and pursue for years.  At the same time she has to be what Fitzgerald portrayed her to be:  vapid, selfish, careless of others.  If you don't buy Daisy, you don't buy Gatsby either. The truth is: Daisy is an unpleasant woman.  For a screenwriter and an actress to convey these polarities is, based on the repeated failures making this movie, extremely difficult if not impossible

Finally, I think the reason a really good version of The Great Gatsby has never been made is that these characters are just not likeable.  They are, as Nick says, ""careless people"".  Even Gatsby, whose heart is large, is a crook living a lie, building his life, and staking his life, on a delusion.  Nick Carrowary, certainly the most sympathetic character in the book, is unlikeable here as well.  He doesn't try to avert the disasters coming; he takes no stand at all about the building chaos around him.  As portrayed in this film version he  is almost as careless as Daisy and her husband.  He plays along to get along.  In the process he is fully complicit in the tragedy that will come.

F. Scott Fitzgerald was a brilliant writer who somehow made readers care about these unlikeable people; he made Gatsby a great romantic figure and a symbol of something very fundamental in the American experience, the ability to remake oneself.  I love the book, but what a writer can do with words and the reader's imagination is fundamentally different from what a filmmaker does with words and moving images.  SEEING the ugliness in Daisy and SEEING Gatsby's own foolishness, in the flesh so to speak, breaks the magic.

This is an overdone movie with nothing besides glitz.  Another Gatsby fail",1410393600,3,3492,4.622764227642277

4969125,4,B0067EKYS6,"This film impressed me as very well put together and entertaining. As befitting a worthy adaptation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel set during the zenith of the Roaring 20s in New York City, it was also very glitzy (reminding me of ""Chicago""). The main actors -- Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby, Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, and Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway -- all gave strong performances, in my opinion. For example, I don't discount Maguire's efforts here, just because he starred in three Spiderman movies. He also appeared in ""Seabiscuit"" and many others, and will star as the late chess champion Bobby Fischer in the soon-to-be-released ""Pawn Sacrifice."" Even Indian actor Amitabh Bachchan, miscast as Gatsby's Jewish mentor, also did a very good job.

With that said, the 2013 Gatsby betrayed at least one notable shortcoming, in my opinion. Although entertaining and of the correct style, the music was anachronistic. One person I know likened it to Rock-and-Roll. I wouldn't go that far, but the Jazz presented here was far more up-to-date than the 1920s. Adding some period-conscious music would have enhanced this film's credibility. Throw in a touch of Ragtime and a little more Gershwin. And yes, ""Old Sport"" did get tedious -- just as in the book, I'm told. Nonetheless, a solid, four-star worthy effort. Fr. Dennis",1409356800,,1337,5.049773755656108

It helped me understand the entire work and I had such empathy for the characters. It would be nice though, for Daisy's husband to be less of a stereotype, but perhaps he is shown as such because that is how he is portrayed in the book.

The casting was flawless, the three leads could not have been more perfect, and while sometimes the music seemed a bit jarring, that may be in part because I don't really listen to rap etc., but some of the choices felt wrong to me. I loved Moulin Rouge (sp?) but perhaps that's in part because I knew and like the songs.

The scene in which Tom and Gatsby confront each other was wonderfully intense, and the shock at their breaking of normal social intercourse was palpable.

I enjoyed the stylistic elements, but there seemed too much of that at the beginning. It took awhile to finally have actual full scenes and for the heart of the story to unfold. I would have chosen different music at certain points.

I LOVED the look and feel of the entire film. Rich detail, artistically beautiful and powerfully done.

4969477,3,B0067EKYS6,"The short answer is, Go ahead, but read the book!  However, the short answer is deceptively  simplistic.  The reality is that even when Baz Luhrmanns adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds most famous novel, Hollywoods third, is at its worse it may be due to his desire to be faithful to the written work.
 For example the two most egregious errors of the movie are the musical score and the presentation of the parties at Gatsbys mansion.  The modern hip-hop music of Jay-Z and Beyonc is wholly inappropriate, not to mention woefully anachronistic, and the party scenes are way overdone.  It may be that Luhrmann thought that an historically accurate rendition of Roaring Twenties bacchanalia and music would fail to capture for our contemporary jaded society Fitzgeralds portrayal of Jazz Age decadence.
 Two other shortcomings may be due to the same desire for fidelity to Fitzgeralds story.  The acting (Leonardo diCaprio plays Gatsby and Tobey Maguire is Nick Carraway, the narrator and Gatsbys neighbor) seems lifeless, and the computerized scenes (And, no, I did not waste my time and money on the 3-D version!) are ridiculous.  Nevertheless, they may be an attempt to portray respectively the detachment of the main characters from their surroundings or even from reality and the pervasive force of their illusions.
 Fortunately, the movie in the main follows Fitzgeralds story line.  Even more importantly, it preserves the novels reflective, at times philosophical, narration by Nick.  It does so by the happy technique of having Nick recovering in an asylum by writing the story of Gatsby.  Although this framework is not part of the novel, it does allow us to hear Fitzgeralds very words, even that hauntingly despairing romantic anti-romantic passage with which he so famously concludes his great novel.
 The Great Gatsby is a poignant critique by an American of American society.  It is much more than an expos of the shallowness of Roaring Twenties frivolity and rebelliousness, a lifestyle that Fitzgerald not only knew about but also lived in many ways.  It is a commentary on the differences between the East and Midwest.  It also displays the futility of the frenetic forces of American progressivism to combat the deep countercurrents of the past.
 At its deepest and most universal The Great Gatsby is a cautionary tale concerning the destructive illusions created by living a dream.  Gatsby had a dream of being a member of the elite wealthy of American society.  Daisy and his love for her were an essential part of that dream.  He created a false persona to conform to his dream.  In the end he could neither escape his real past nor recapture a seemingly ideal moment from it and his dream consumed him.
 Fitzgeralds writing is richly textured and poetic, something that no movie can ever capture.  It is also a bleak and hopeless vision of human life in which we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
 Fitzgeralds masterpiece deserves a careful reading, yes, even a meditative one.  It reminds us that such an attempt at self-creation as Gatsbys repeats the fundamental human desire to be like God and the disastrous consequences of self-deifying hubris described in Genesis 3 and 4.  It should lead us to examine our hearts in order to see whether we have fallen prey to this human tendency to live in a self-created dream world that we strive to make a reality.  But I speak as a Christian who believes in the possibility of change, of a turning around and going against the current, a painful turning around called repentance.  This repentance is not a human possibility.  It is only possible because of the One who entered the current of history from the outside and can redeem us from this present evil age, bearing us against the current to the new age created by God.
 So, go ahead and see the movie, if you want to, but please, please read the book.",1403913600,6,3915,4.895295902883157
4969508,5,B0067EKYS6,"Everyone has an opinion about Luhrman's vision of Gatsby, however I think this version best captures the musicality of the source material.  As usual with a Luhrman production, the visuals are over the top.  The colors pop and the music is a constant companion to the drama.  However, given the florid language of Fitzgerald, the eye popping visuals work.  The conceit of the Nick Carroway character writing down the story as part of a therapeutic endeavor after the fact allows them to work in some of Fitzgerald's amazingly lyrical prose.",1403827200,2,540,4.966666666666667

She has a deeper, sexy voice and shows vulnerability to the pt. that you don't hate her nearly as much as you hate Mia's Daisy.
Leonardo was a bit too intense and talked too much and frowned too often.  There wasn't the vulnerability of Redford's Gatsby.
Still, I liked this version's acting better but the Redford and Farrow one more accurately depicted the time period.

While it does take a few liberties (Nick in a sanitarium...), it captures the spirit and beauty of the novel. The film is saturated with color and the music (an anachronism) is absolutely perfect (and powerful). Fitzgerald was one of the Lost Generation. He lived Ezra Pound's credo, ""Make it new!""

And I really hate the use of modern rap music in The Great Gatsby which is defined by jazz in the novel and the decade it was written.  Still, the actual music soundtrack (not the stupid songs which will actually age this film faster than anything else) is quite haunting and, for the most part, the film is a straight telling of Fitzgerald's masterpiece.  Wonderful performances and great recreation of the time period (although I could have done without a lot the CGI work - particularly of Gatsby's mansion).  The 1970s version, which is stiffly directed, also had a great cast (though neither film manages to get Daisy right) and wonderfully recreated 1920s New York without any special effects.  Still, other than Carey Mulligan's Daisy (and Amitabh Bachchan who has as much in common with Meyer Wolfsheim as I have with Indira Gandhi), the other characters could have stepped right out of the novel.  I just wish Luhrmann would not have given in to his baser instincts and include modern pop music in the film.  Again, in a lot less than ten years time, this music will age the film, and instead of being a Gatsby for the ages, it will always be stuck in 2013.

Truly one of the best movie versions of a classic book ever produced.",1400976000,,297,4.96
4969604,4,B0067EKYS6,"Theres a lot to like in this version of F .Scott Fitzgeralds classic novel of the jazz age, although this ones a little to jazzy for me. Aussie director Baz Luhrmann was an awesome choice to head this project. He captures the spectacle of the novel and its age better than any other I can imagine.  Its reminiscent of his earlier works Romeo + Juliet and Moulin Rouge!  The best aspect of the film is the cinematography: the sets, fashion, jewelry, etc. are executed to perfection.

The cast is excellent; DiCaprio owns this role as much as any hes played.  Tobey Maguire is great as well; hes as effective as Sam Waterston was in the 1974 version. Ive always thought he owned that role. Robert Redford was good in that version. Hes not the actor that DiCaprio is. But he certainly looked the part. Carey Mulligan surprised me how well she played Daisy Buchanan, although after seeing her performance in An Education, I knew she was destined for greatness.

Summing up what I liked and what I didn't is almost as simple as the films emphasis on style over substance. That emphasis encompasses the whole jazz age, so that the film portrays that should come as no surprise. Everyone and everything as seen through the eyes of Nick, the narrator, is completely superficial. As an indictment of the near-universal values of the era, this film really works. I did not like much of the soundtrack. It was distracting and anachronistic, just a device to relate the jazz age material to the hip hop generation. Luhrmanns Gatsby is certainly visually stunning and undeniably entertaining, but I think the update detracts from the real power of the story.

But as I was soon to find out, Baz Luhrman was EXACTLY the right person for this job. I thought THE GREAT GATSBY was the best treatment I've ever seen, and that includes the TV one so often overlooked. His sense of cinematic zing and dramatic exaggeration was perfect here, and I not only really enjoyed this movie, but felt he really captured much of what previous versions had failed to grasp.

First off, his 1920s New York is an amazing confection, a blend of reality and the hype that caught the Jazz Age and the heyday of the pre-Depression stock market beautifully. It was more than a time machine of sorts...it was one that captured a mashup of music, wealth and style that portrayed the wild, chaotic frenzy of the pre-Crash era. It was a time of fast music, women, and cars, of bright colors and new hair and clothing styles that shocked THEIR older generation like our 60s did some four decades later. Luhrmann - a man who works well with music at the core of his films - did a great job here. (The movie won two Oscars for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design.)

A really big plus this time around was the acting: while I liked Robert Redford in the earlier movie (as I have in almost everything he's in), he has always had a staid, stilted way about him in roles like this one; he carries himself like an Actor's Studio actor, saying lines ""just so,"" but not naturally. Sure, he's gorgeous, and his celebrity seemed right at the time for Gatsby, but it is under Leonardo DiCaprio's adept hand that it really becomes possible to see how perfect HE is for this role. DiCaprio is able to portray so many aspects of Gatsby perfectly: the romantic, the heroic, the vulnerable, the gangster...and they all blend seamlessly in his portrayal.

But what is particularly notable is what an improvement Carey Mulligan is over Mia Farrow, who I thought more than anything else sank the 1974 movie like a lead minnow. In Mulligan's hands, Daisy is more the woman Fitzgerald invented: a woman who chose convenience over romance, a woman tired of loving a bully whose countless dalliances have made her ""cynical,"" to use her word for it, and a woman who is dearly WANTS to love yet is painfully unaware that true love might come at some price. And, more than anything else, Mulligan is a woman that a man might give up his future for, whereas Farrow's Daisy made me want to drive nails through my ears: she gave such a shrill performance I could hear dogs wailing.

Additionally, the crucial part of Tom Buchanan is handled extremely well by Joel Edgerton, who has enough physical presence to be able to portray him as a hulking menace of a man...a brute. In the earlier movie he was so capably played by Bruce Dern that he masked the fact that he was so physically wrong for the part.

But, to return to Luhrmann, yes, he took certain liberties...some have complained about the framing device he used of having Nick Carraway's narration be a tale told in a sanitarium. But this is one liberty that paid off well...the conceit works perfectly as a confession, of a sort, given that this is really a morality play. It is after all a tale told by a man (played well by Tobey Maguire) who is trying his best to come to terms which a remarkable summer that has changed him forever, but this idea of having him tell his story to a doctor - one who indeed urges him to give in to his literary side - and this gives it just the right angle for clever turns of phrases and verbal wordplay.

Not everything is golden: some of Luhrmann's attempts come off schlocky: when Jordan Baker tells her story of Gatsby the man appears in front of an obvious green screen, though the effect does come off like a scene from an old, dated movie. And given Nick's narrator status, how are we made aware of events he clearly did not see, like a man being taken outside a gate and pummeled?

But overall, Luhrmann's film is a triumph. His cinematography is outstanding: time and again the shots are timeless, postcards sent from a forgotten era, colored by a splendor that is more than a time or place...it was an evocation, a beckoning, a dream. It is a film peopled by ""careless"" people - as Nick tells us -- whose money allowed them to obey their every capricious whim - people whose station afforded them a lifestyle above morality, above having to pay for the things that others yearned for but could never afford.

And most of all, it is a story about Gatsby, whose gift for boundless romance is too perfect to be sullied by this cruel world, a world he took part in so that he could touch the heart of a woman too corrupted by it to be his equal. And Luhrmann lets that shine through here, a concept captured so well in print that it's taken almost a century to capture it again, this time on film. THE GREAT GATSBY is a great turn by a director (and co-screenwriter) who has just grown by leaps and bounds in my estimation.",1398384000,4,5925,5.013211382113822

4969784,5,B0067EKYS6,"Baz Luhrman directed this 2013 version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus in the garish and grandiose style in which he directed 2001's ""Moulin Rouge"",  complete with zippy camera shots pushing us into facial close-ups,  or zooming up and down,  panning to give viewers just a glimpse of certain dramatic details, and a modernized and synthesized score, incongruous with the Jazz Age that it depicts, but presumably done to attract a younger audience, (Even many of the songs from the 1920s were not written at the time in which the story takes place), a few hazy  black and white shots to artificially age the otherwise sharp cinematography to make the view look more in sync with the period when photography was only black and white,and a saddened and chastened narrator typing a story about an ill-fated central figure whom he mourns deeply.
 An element not featured in Fitzgerald's original story is the narrator, Nick Carraway( a boyish, amiable and folksy Tobey Maguire, still sounding like an adolescent with a crack in his voice) being confined to one Perkins Sanitarium where he is recovering from alcohol addiction, where Dr. Perkins(Jack Thompson, discreetly worked into the piece) in the winter of 1929.
 Carraway notes how the fashionable set drank to keep up with the times, and contributed nothing new, reminding any student of history of how that scenario repeated itself via drug use in the 1960s.
 Carraway recounts his Midwestern upbringing, his time at Yale, and his aspirations of being a writer before becoming a bonds salesman on Wall Street, renting a small cottage  for $80 a month in between the illustrious mansions of West Egg, across from the courtesy bay of East Egg where the old moneyed families live, including his cousin Daisy Fay Buchanan( a sharp eyed, very pretty, and indeed fay-like Carey Mulligan, slightly more assertive  and less breathy than Mia Farrow was in the part four decades earlier), who lives with her husband Tom( a strapping Joel Edgerton), whom Nick knew at Yale, and daughter, Pammy(Emily Foreman, Tiger Leacy Wyvill, Charlize Skinner), in an accurately  recreated  red brick Georgian-style mansion. The spired, castle like mansion where most of the drama will unfold, is also in accordance with the book's description.
  Tom, a polo player leads Nick into the house where he has a playful and lighthearted moment with his college buddy before reuniting him with Daisy as she lies on a couch in an open and aired room, with curtains blowing in the summer breeze. Her companion, Jordan Baker(Elizabeth Debeicki)also lies on the couch, and is introduced to Nick amid Daisy's promise to fling them together.
 Their dinnertime is rafe with repartee, gossip, and conversations that make Nick uncomfortable.
 A Mr. Gatsby is mentioned as Nick's neighbor, temporarily drawing Daisy's attention. Jordan reveals to Nick that Tom is having an  extramarital fling, and Daisy reveals her personal unhappiness and feelings about her daughter's future.
 Soon after, Tom takes Nick on what he initially claims will be a luncheon at the Yale Club,but it turns out to be a jaunt into the  seedy underbelly of  his life---the Valley of Ashes where they stop at a gas station run by George Wilson( Jason Clarke, who appeared with Joel Edgerton in ""Zero Dark Thirty""), where Nick is introduced to Tom's mistress, Wilson's wife, Myrtle(a trashily voluptuous Isla Fisher) to whom Tom slips some money so she can travel to meet him in town.
 When the two hook up,Tom buys Myrtle a dog  for the NYC apartment where they carry on their affair, an uncomfortable Nick tries to leave, but is blocked by Myrtle's  sister Catherine(Adelaide Clemens) and a Mr. and Mrs. McKee(Eden Falk and Kate Mulvaney). Catherine chats with Nick about the illicit couple's inability to stand their respective spouses, and offers him some pills. Unlike the 1974 version, we see Nick get drunk,and view himself as both an insider and outsider to what is going on in his life.
 He finds himself on his front porch the next day, with no idea how he got there, and a feeling that his mysterious, wealthy , party-throwing neighbor is watching him.
 Nick soon receives an invitation to attend a wild party next door, and is the only guest to actually have received such an invitation.
 Dressed nicely enough but sans a tuxedo, the young broker joins the festivities and is reunited with Jordan as he tries to find his host.
 The incongruous modern music under the auspices of Beethoven's alleged dubious descendant, Klipspringer(Brendan Maclean) galvanizes the party, and the colors and atmosphere are more intense than in the 1974 version. Maguire's Nick Carraway busts some modern dance moves on the dais above the pool, but he also gives a broader narration of the story.
 One Teddy Barton(Gus Murray) keeps trying to divert Jordan's attention away from the penniless Nick, reminding him that ""Rich girls don't marry poor boys.""
 After chatting with a servant, and an elderly gentleman in the mansion's library called ""Owl Eyes""( Max Cullum), Nick is no farther along  in locating his host than before.
 Soon he's back outside as Klipspringer begins a ""Jazz History of the World"" playing George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue""(two years prematurely, given its 1924 debut), and someone addresses  him as ""Old Sport"" while asking if he had known him during the war. Nick acknowledges his  time in the service, explains that he hasn't met the host, repeats rumors others have said about the host, and... Lo and behold the mystery is solved!
 Standing before Nick is his handsome young host, Jay Gatsby, handing him a glass of champagne, played by  a still impishly cherubic-faced Leonardo(Will someone please give him an Oscar already?) DiCaprio.
 A striking difference between the newer cast and the cast of 40 years ago is  how young the newer cast seems although they're approximately same age as the previous cast was.
 The male leads in Coppola's  version looked like  men aged by war. But here, youth is flaming and blossoming.
  The two-decades-old friendship of DiCaprio and Maguire, who first worked together in 1993's ""This Boy's Life"" comes across in this film, and while they both sound as though they could pass for teenagers--DiCaprio's full, slightly weathering visage looking as round and as sweet as a sugar cookie-- the film's warm lighting makes the sun appear to beam on their camaraderie.
 Zipping through New York in a fated yellow car not long afterwards, Jay takes Nick to a speakeasy where he introduces him to  his associate,gambler Meyer Wolfsheim(Amitabh Bachchan), who fixed the 1919 World Series. Jay leaves the encounter mysteriously when Tom shows up, and a befuddled Nick soon runs into Jordan, who tells him of Jay's desire to have him invite Daisy to tea, revealing their previous history together. A reluctant Nick agrees.
 Jay hires florists and caterers to prepare Nick's cottage for the encounter, which occurs at long last with much awkwardness and poignancy.
 After the three spend time on the bay together, Jay escorts the cousins over to his house after tea to give them a tour. At one point, Daisy weeps at Gatsby's wealth, acquired too late for him to marry her. But she reviews his scrapbook of mementos of her, which he kept from the time her family entertained him and his Army camp buddies in Louisville during the war. We learn of a young James Gatz'( Tasman Palazzo, Callan MacAuliffe) early life and his life-altering mentor, Dan Cody(Steve Bisley). One of the films' most delightful moments  is in watching the cousins do the Charleston to the sounds of Jay's Wurlitzer as Klipspringer plays, to the amusement of their host, Dicaprio flashing that beautiful white-toothed smile of his...
 Soon Jay takes over the dance as the affair begins. After one more party, attended by the Buchanans, the lights of Gatsby's pleasure palace slowly go out, and only servants affiliated with Wolfsheim are kept on to discreetly make way for his mistress.
 There is a brief scene of adulterous lovers together in bed-Jay's full, well-tanned muscular physique dominating that of his pale and fay paramour, and of her sleeping peacefully on his shoulder by heaving masculine breasts with hair like golden fleece...
 Nick and Jordan are present at a lunch at the Buchanan's where Jay's and Daisy's affair becomes apparent.
 Things come to a head  at the Plaza Hotel, where the previously preoccupied Nick gradually remembers his own 30th birthday.
 Jay and Daisy leave, with a fateful collision of mistresses that alters the course of events. The shattering of a pearl necklace is symbolic in so many ways.
  A line from the musical ""Camelot"" comes to mind: ""In the dying candle's gleam came the sundown of a dream.""
  Flaming youth will burn out.
  In lieu of a grieving father's involvement,and a final confrontation with Tom, we end with a disillusioned Nick taking responsibility for a tragedy's aftermath, and writing an unforgettable cautionary tale, cathartic for a man who has kept too many secrets for too long--a tale whose message transcends the Jazz Age and which will bode well for all time!",1396915200,,9143,5.0092592592592595

Very similar artistically to Moulin Rouge as every scene is a firework of extravagant color, depicting the character of the 1920s very well.

I was particularly found of the score as well, fusing modern music to the 1920s scenery seamlessly.

4969852,3,B0067EKYS6,"Is the acting entertaining?  Yes.  Well-done.  Are the settings accurate?  Yes.  Visually interesting.  Is the story enthralling?  Well, if you like a leisurely paced mystery that turns tragic, yes.  If you enjoyed the book, it follows the novel well.

So what's to complain about here?  First, the music.  Often it is so distracting and off-putting and inaccurate that I almost gave up on the movie.  Is this an F. Scott Fitzgerald adaptation or a commercial for Jay-Z and Beyonce?  At one point the soundtrack is a slower version of Crazy in Love.  What the heck?  Other points in the film sound like two songs played at once over one another.  Then there is the rap.  Rap?  Really?  In a novel set in 1922?  The Roaring 20's had some cool and appropriate music.  Why ruin the film with such an inaccuracy?

Second, a little distracting is the color.  Often the scenes are so over-saturated in various colors that it feels like you are watching one of Willy Wonka's wildest dreams.  Or an explosion at a jellybean factory.  Just overdone.  Why?

Other than these flaws, the movie is a faithful presentation of Fitzgerald's book.  The tragedy of Gatsby's love for a woman who is not worth the dirt on his loafers is still poignant.  The statement this story makes about the vapid and cruel and wasteful existences of the rich is still appropriate.  Following Gatsby via NIck is still heart-wrenching and interesting.

And the ending is quite sad, but quite well-done.  Kudos to DiCaprio and Maguire.  In fact, I have to say that all of the acting is stellar.

4969881,3,B0067EKYS6,"I remember trying to read this book in seventh grade and thought,""Man this has to be the most boring book ever."" When I got older and started enjoying more historic time periods, I started embracing the 1920's style and culture. I enjoyed the actors of this move, the visual style I expected from Baz Luhrmann. I enjoyed his other works even though I am a person who usually enjoys authentic renderings of time periods. For some reason I love it when a director blends the historic with the modern like the movie Titus. When a director does that I feel it shows human themes are timeless.
The reason why I enjoyed this film is because the atmosphere is amazing. Like a drunk induced emotions of time that moves too fast. I like how the main character narrates like a novel. I know most people do not like that but I feel it captures the thoughts of a character close to a novel. And of course the over-exaggeration of the parties,  the feeling you are in some sort of high like you are there is why you watch a Baz Luhrmann film.
Now what I do not like about the film is the use of music. The hip hop music just did not resonate with me. They could at least make the hip hop lyrics with 1920s instruments. It had no sense of timelessness like his other films just a feeling of a rude neighbor intruding with his music you don't feel like listening too. Imagine boardwalk empire with rap music. Well that's how corny it felt.
If it wasn't for the music I would say 5 stars but since it is a Baz Luhrmann film that relies on music on visuals I gave it 3.",1395619200,,1552,4.261016949152542

4969917,4,B0067EKYS6,"I've never tried absinthe, never been privy to this opiate's ability to bring to its user vivid and fantastic images, sights, and sounds.  Yet something tells me watching a Baz Luhrmann film is akin to drinking absinthe; I became a fan of this creative director ever since I was floored by his amazingly bizarre&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moulin-Rouge/dp/B000077VR3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moulin Rouge</a>.  And his latest offering, a provocative version of Fitzgerald's classic THE GREAT GATSBY, evokes the same sensations:  vivid, brightly colored images; anachronistic music; wild party shots almost to excess; haunting sights transposing to another scene; eerie animation; and acute attention to detail.  Luhrmann weaves all of these mind-altering components like an enchanted sorcerer, making his THE GREAT GATSBY one entertaining experience.

We're all familiar with the fatalistic, tragic story.  And the cast does an admirable job bringing Fitzgerald's characters to life; Tobey Maguire lends credibility to Nick Carraway's initial naivete, giving way to anguish and despair; Leonardo DiCaprio keeps getting better and better, and here he doesn't disappoint as the ever-optimistic Gatsby, forever pursing that green orgiastic light; and Carey Mulligan is a pseudo weak link as pampered, indecisive Daisy Buchanan.  Of the remaining cast, I especially enjoyed Joel Edgerton as the philandering jock Tom Buchanan, and the scrumptious Isla Fisher as Tom's mistreated mistress Myrtle Wilson.  But again, the real star of this ensemble is Luhrmann; he brings his version of THE GREAT GATSBY to pyrotechnic life like a master craftsman.  So as far as the absinthe, I'll pass.  I've seen heady images, compliments of Luhrmann.  That's psychedelic enough for me.

4969923,1,B0067EKYS6,"Perhaps because I grew up on Long Island Sound in Connecticut, and F. Scott Fitzgerald penned his literary masterpiece, The Great Gatsby in my home town, it is my favorite work of American literature.  I thought the 1970s movie version of the film was OK but felt Mia Farrow was miscast as Daisy.  From the reviews of the 2013 adaption I knew it was largely a flop but wanted to see for myself what a contemporary director might turn out.

From the get-go with its anachronistic hip-hop musical score by Jay Z, Baz Luhrmann, proceeds to lay waste to this classic story.  I should have known from seeing the stomach churning trailers for Moulin Rouge that this would be more of the same.  Garish, over the top, over produced, and under edited Lurhrmanns Gatsby is clearly aimed at a nation of people who won't read anything longer than 140 characters, and never read the book.  Fitzgeralds book relies on expert mastery of the language and is full of subtle imagery and intelligent dialog; youll get none of that here but snippets.  The vehicle of using poorly cast Toby Maguires character Nick reliving the tragic events by way of a therapeutic journal writing exercise at an alcohol rehab clinic is tiresome.

CGI for a film such as this should be unnecessary but for whatever reason its used extensively and to poor effect.  The wardrobe budget would feed a third world country for a year.  Gatsbys walking stick and oversized pinky ring are creations of this film, he was a bootlegger, but not a pimp.  His car in the novel is described as being a cream yellow with a green leather interior, not this screaming yellow nightmare that he drives like he stole it.  Every scene is a study in excess and overly choreographed.

Casting is everything after the screenplay and no one fits their role well in Luhrmanns interpretation.  Leonardo DiCaprio looks uncomfortable in this part, maybe because he lacks the background to play such a rags-to-riches fellow who is full of hope and haunted by his past?  All I know is that using the affectation old sport every other line doesnt make him Gatsby.  JG certainly says that phrase in the book but not to the extent Leo does and it wears thin very quickly.

I never heard of Carey Mulligan and while at least in terms of appearance shes an improvement on Mia Farrow.  Here is a character who is supposed to be so compelling that she drives our protagonist to expend vast sums of money and make grand gestures all with the aim of winning her favor and winding back the clock to when they were first together.  Off hand I cant think of an actress who could convey that beauty and desirability but its not Ms. Mulligan.

Joel Edgerton didn't seem physically big enough for the role of the brutish Tom Buchanan (DiCaprios an inch taller according ti IMDB).  Jordan Bakers part in the story was watered down and forgettable while Isla Fischer does a decent job with what little she gets to do as Myrtle Wilson, Toms mistress.

Fans of the novel will mostly be irritated at the details that are wrong.  For example they go through the trouble of pointing out Wolfscheims tie pin which is made from a human molar, but its actually his cufflinks- why change this?  Bottom line, purists who cherish F. Scott Fitzgeralds work should avoid Lurhmanns tedious flick.",1395187200,41,3297,4.664359861591696

It loses all the subtlety, mystery, and social commentary of the book and replaces it with inappropriate and distracting computer effects and a hip-hop sound track. All this would be okay if the director had replaced it with something creative or thought-provoking, but instead this version is reduced to a childish, melodramatic plot in a Walt Disney animated style.  The costumes were great, though.

CGI was way overused, the music was in a word ... horrid.  I was hoping for so much more from Baz Luhrmann.

Based on a novel, this tragic love story takes place in the roaring 20's in New York City and surrounding Long Island.  The reproduction of the times is remarkable and much appreciated by this viewer.  The entire film story allowed one the view of that era through the third person's narration of Nick Garraway played by Tobie Maguire.  Leonardo De Caprio took off from his Howard Hughes portrait of ten years ago and is believable as the ""The Great Gatsby.

Although I had not seen the other Gatsby films and missed this film at the theater, I enjoyed this film even though it did not have a successful run at the local theater.

4969979,4,B0067EKYS6,"I stayed away from the film when it came out in theaters due to some critical reviews, and also because I was so disappointed in the Redford/Farrow version.  I think that expectations play a big part in one's enjoyment of a film, at least they do for me.  I had loved the novel, (who doesn't?) loved Robert Redford (who doesn't?) and thought Mia Farrow was lovely.  So I expected a lot from that film and was terribly let down, mostly due to the performance of Farrow, who was pregnant at the time (she failed to tell the directors) and gave off totally the wrong vibe for the part.

So, not expecting the magic of the novel, or anything approaching that, I watched this (for free from Netflix) and was pleasantly surprised.  I'd been warned of the excesses of Luhrman so I wasn't shocked.  I was happy that Carey Mulligan at least looked good and I liked Tobey Maguire.  Mostly, it was the performance of DiCaprio that made it worth watching. I have to say that I think he's up there with Redford for charm.  All together, the original spirit of the novel--that of the character of the Great Gatsby--and his impossible romance were brought to the audience in a  heartfelt, convincing way.

4970122,1,B0067EKYS6,"Speaking as a serious film collector and viewer with a 1900 DVD library.

First of all, Warner Brothers inflicts a bunch of disgusting promos for forthcoming releases before the film even starts that takes about 15 minutes to wade through. Of all the cheap pandering of product to a captive audience, this is the most disgusting abuse of the viewer ever seen.

Absolutely one of the worst sequels ever made, in fact one of the worst films ever made. The director doesn't know the era or his craft, that is certainly obvious. Only some drunken cocaine sniffing idiot would dare put his name on this trash. Who is this clown anyhow?? Any high school kid would have done better by a long shot.
Thumping rap music is more than just offensive, it stinks. The music of the 1920s was and certainly still is fun to listen to, this is absolute garbage. In fact, it is so typical of the absolute incompetence of most film directors these days when it comes to music. This rude screaming black tribal noise has no place in a film supposedly taking place in the early 1920s. The director, this Baz, whoever he is or thinks he is, ought to be banned from cinema for life. Talk about bad taste and blundering ignorance, this trash takes the crown by far.
DiCaprio is OK as Gatsby; but nowhere up to the performance that Redford gave in the previous version. Daisy is horrible miscast, she should be confined to playing the bimbos one sees soliciting on street corners. Nick is so badly cast, one wonders what idiot was responsible for the casting.
All in all, one has to ask why even some fourth rate actor would ever consider damaging his professional standing by appearing in such garbage.

No such exaggerated Disneyland cartoon castle exists on Long Island, been there. The first J Duesenberg was in late 1929, the SJ Duesenberg came out in 1932, not the early 1920s, same for the Auburn Speedster.  The so called party sequence is an offense to the eye and ear.  Even in the most extravagant parties during that era, such deportment would never have been tolerated even in the wildest whore house or speakeasy. Again well illustrating the stupidity of the director and producers. No one seems to understand what that era was all about or why and this trash certainly gives no clue at all. Least of all this alleged mincing arty-farty so called director.
The prints should be collected and burned. Warner Bros. should be run out of the business for having anything to do with this garbage.
The earlier Gatsby version with Robert Redford was made with taste and care and certainly worth having in ones library.

For a sequel that far exceeds the original, watch SABRINA with Harrison Ford. This Gatsby is a disgrace and slur on Scott Fitzgerald's story and memory.  My DVD was thrown in the garbage, where it belongs.",1392508800,8,2806,4.668016194331984

4970255,1,B0067EKYS6,"This movie was not only a total bastardization of the book, it was also the biggest collection of awful acting, the worst example of excess in editing, and the most ridiculous collection of non-sequitors.

It opens with a quote from the book that doesn't exist in the book, and in fact perfectly demonstrates how totally it misses the whole point of the book. Important lines are attributed to the wrong people, thereby missing the point. The narrator is portrayed as having fallen prey to the mess that is Gatsby's life, when in fact he is a far more reticent observer in the book. The whole thing is wrong, wrong, wrong.

And to make it worse, it's not even beautiful. It's obscene. As in all versions of the story, the big deal is Who is Gatsby, so his entrance is a big scene. Only in this version, he enters to a background of climaxing fireworks, like massive ejaculations writ large. He regularly appears against a backdrop of imagery from the Hubble Space Telescope. This movie looks like what you'd get if you let a 16-year-old boy loose with all the special effects he could get his hands on, and you'd given him a shot of speed first.

And why does Carey Mulligan continue to get so many leading lady parts? Sorry, but in my opinion she doesn't have the looks or charisma to merit the faith that the powers that be in Hollywood keep bestowing upon her. I don't get it.

I thought it would be strange to listen to a soundtrack filled with Jay Z songs for a movie of this era (the roaring '20's) but the songs actually do the movie justice and serve it well. If you look hard, you can also catch an uncredited cameo by Lady Gaga. The colors 'pop' in this film! Cinematography is excellant! The wardrobes are fantastic!

4970376,5,B0067EKYS6,The Great Gatsby has always been one of my favorite books and Leonardo did a great job of playing the role of Gatsby. This movie is not for kids however as there are many sexual references and representations of cheating on marriages. Looking past that the movie is fantastic!,1390003200,,276,4.653061224489796
4970417,4,B0067EKYS6,"Against all expectations, I actually ended up liking this movie. It's infused with the unmistakable Baz Luhrmann imprint: this director imagines the most over-the-top scenarios possible and then goes 30% more over-the-top. Here, he outdoes himself. It's ""Moulin Rouge!"" meets ""A Clockwork Orange"" . . on acid. Scott Fitzgerald, chronicler of the Jazz Age (one might say the inventor of it, at least, the name), no stranger to excess and debauchery, would find Baz's rendition of Gatsby's house parties too dazzling to look upon.

I totally understand where Baz was coming from with this production: he wanted to capture for a 21st century audience the absolute extravagance, wild fiscal post-war optimism and cutting-edge pop culture explosion in music, dance, materialism, media, and social mores--all marinated liberally in alcohol--that earmarked the Jazz Age. A more sedate and faithful hewing to 1920s period would not have achieved that, since 20 and 30-somethings going to movies today associate the 1920s with, not their grandparents' generation, but their great-grandparents' or even their great-great-parents'. But for those who were young in the 1920s, those were dangerous, exhilarating, completely 'modern' times. So Baz transposes motifs from today's youth culture on Gatsby's world to convey the modernity, the sexual freedom, the licentiousness and the lawlessness of that time for those of us who are reduced to reading about it in books. Had MTV been around in 1925, it surely would have been broadcasting from one of Gatsby's parties on Long Island . . and Jay-Z would have been DJ. One has to make peace with this idea in order to enjoy Baz's version.

Our quartet of leads all do impressive work. I was initially dubious about Leo DiCaprio in the part of Gatsby, but I think he nails the quintessential paradox of Jay Gatsby: Handsome and self-assured on the surface; underneath a roiling sea of self-doubt, social insecurity, longing and rage. When this Jay Gatsby lets the unruffled faade slip and shows his internal darkness, the onlookers have no difficulty believing that he could have killed a man, easily. Leo has developed a manly heft and gravitas as an actor that would not have been thought possible in his ""Titanic"" heartthrob days, when he was a callow and skinny 23-year-old who looked younger. His Gatsby is quite excellent, though slightly marred by an odd, self-conscious accent that I suppose is meant to be 'posh Atlantic'. He would have done better to use his own. When Gatsby calls people 'old sport' (often), it sounds particularly labored. ""Old sport"" sounded much more natural coming from Redford.

Tobey Maguire is alternately appealing and annoying as our narrator, Nick Carroway. Nick is definitely a more challenging role than Maguire's best known 'Peter Parker/Spiderman' schtick. He captures well enough the 'outsider looking in' essence of Nick, but it's hard to accept him at the grownups' table sometimes. In comparison to DiCaprio or Joel Edgerton as Tom (a noteworthy performance from him, capturing the tricky mix of brutality and masculine charisma in Daisy's husband), Maguire seems like a 12-year-old boy who's wandered into his great-great-granddaddy's closet by mistake. Baz frames the novel as Nick's recollections to his psychiatrist in the sanitarium where he's been sent to dry out.

This movie was shot entirely in Sydney, Australia, and most of the dizzy panoramic views of Fitzgerald's New York City and its environs are entirely computer-generated. It visually stuns, and I mean one feels quite literally assaulted from all the visual and aural stimuli . . but there is an essentially hollow feeling, too. Of course, Fitzgerald's New York no longer exists . . but it still feels like a cheat.

This is a remake in every sense of the word, and it is starting how similar this is to the 1974 production. You merely edit out Robert Redford. Mia Farrow, Sam Waterston and Bruce Dern  and paste in Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton and you have exactly the same movie. Thats how undistinctive this new production is. There was no reason to remake this movie. It was already made 40 years ago, with the same look, the same sets, the same screenplay, in essence, the same visual tribute to the hollow Jay Gatsby, his meaningless life, and his colorless friends.

You add it all up and you wind up with the same yellow Duesenberg running over the same woman in the same circumstance in the same industrial wasteland leading to the same senseless conclusion, all based on the same overrated F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.",1389916800,3,1168,4.632850241545894

The only complaint I have about this movie, is that it did not really distinguish itself well from the 1974 version of the movie. The script wasn't exactly the same but the scenes were pretty darn close. If you want to save a little money, it might be less expensive to get your hands on the older version.

I went from slouching on the couch to actually caring about the characters.  DiCaprio was terrific as always, and I even liked Tobey Maguire (so that must have been some great directing.)

4970499,3,B0067EKYS6,"I love Baz Luhrmann's eye & ear candy. But in often detracts from the emotional content of a truly complex story. Which _The Great Gatsby_ is. It's a great story about love and the real world, about desire and expectation, judgement and despair, corruption, power, survival and helplessness. I don't think Luhrmann's version does that complexity justice. It made me want to go watch Redford, Farrow and Dern again. And who can really top Dern in his role?

This remake did please me by including, verbatim, my favorite quote from the book -- ""I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."" (that I've carried around in my little book of great quotes since 1982).

However, I admit, Tobey Maguire irritates me beyond reason. I guess he's perfect for the impotent third wheel narrator of the book, but that doesn't make him less subtly-annoying. It's hard for me to hear his voice-over without going into a kind of numb stupor... spiced with irk.

I was also holding out high hopes that it would be another ""Moulin Rouge.""

We had the movie on for about 5 - 10 minutes before deciding it was complete garbage.  To begin with, the music which accompanied the movie was an insult to jazz as it's quality isn't even comparable to that of jazz and the musicians of the jazz age.  Updating the music was unnecessary and destroyed the film for me.  I should mention that my grandfather was a professional musician (beginning at the age of 12) during the jazz age and throughout his entire life.

I also did not like the choice of Tobey McGuire.  The only movie I liked him in was Pleasantville as it was a perfect fit for his youthful, flaccid personality.  He is not a good actor and should not have been considered for a work of this magnitude.",1389312000,9,1048,4.450261780104712

4970553,1,B0067EKYS6,"I'm not one of those people who have some sentimental attachment to the Robert Redford version. Although that earlier movie was very good, I was never a big fan as I thought that it lacked a certain flair. So, my loathing for this modern version is based solely on its lack of merit. It is a cartoon that frequently can be mistaken for a spoof.

I knew beforehand that the soundtrack was mainly composed of rap and hip hop. As disappointing as that is for me (who loves the music of the 1920s and usually deplores ahistorical touches in period pieces), even that wasn't a deal breaker, as such music could accurately convey the bacchanalian frenzy of the 1920s to a modern audience. However, the choice of music was a portent. The entire movie was completely dumbed down for the benefit of an audience of modern American simpletons. Everything, and I mean everything, had to be spelled out and explicitly explained. Nuance, implication, subtlety and respect for the audience are non-existent here, and probably for good reason, as American audiences under 50 years old neither understand nor desire to watch anything more complex than good looking people having sex. When the movie showed a woman from the early 1920s_explaining_who Kaiser Wilhelm_was_(""you know- the evil German king""), I was determined to throw the DVD right in the garbage.

As if the superstructure of the movie (the script and plot) wasn't bad enough, the actors were deficient as well. DiCaprio was appropriately elegant and handsome, but seemed to be concentrating too hard on maintaining his strange accent to do any heartfelt acting. The actress who played Daisy is not the type of woman to inspire the type of devotion that she was supposed to have enflamed in Gatsby; she looked like a 12 year old hobbit. And Tobey McGuire's Nick Carraway is just too unbelievably goofy looking and sounding to take seriously. That anyone would want to associate with this clownish jester is just not credible. The only really good performance came from Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan who is convincingly brutish and dominating, the type of man who would both repel and attract Daisy.

There are just too many elements that deserve censure. What they all amount to in the end is a failure of a movie that insults its source material and any intelligent audience.",1388966400,18,2323,4.875949367088608

It still has some of the same likable quality, but overall it puts more effort into big sweeping scenes and showcasing the actors in the best way possible than actually capturing the story that made me love the original so long along. It's not horrible, but it's just not a movie that I would really want to watch again unless it was playing when I couldn't really find anything else to watch. I'd rather re-watch the original any day than this.",1388966400,,620,4.447368421052632

4970576,2,B0067EKYS6,"I LOVE the Great Gatsby.  It is one of my most favorite novels of all times.  And I just loved the 1970s version with Robert Redford and Mia Follows. And I had high expectations for this version because of the cast members.  But I was highly disappointed.
Leonardo Di Caprio is no Robert Redford or Gatsby.  He made the role seems unnatural and everytime he said ""old sport,"" it just sounded so forced.  Robert Redford is a natural Gatsby and he exudes the character.  Mia Follows is a much better Daisy as well.
And I agree with other reviewers...the modern rap music that they put in this video is so annoying and NOT matching to the period which does affect the quality of the movie and my viewing experiences.  They also messed up the quotes from the characters.  Some lines were mix and match from who was supposed to originally said it.  I have read the book as well.  The 1970s version did a much better job staying closer to the book.
This newer version is filled with glitz and glam but I still prefer the original version from the 1970 with Robert R.
It was so painful getting through this movie.  I lost interest half way through the movie and could not wait for it to end.
I was glad that I waited to watch it on Amazon rather than spending over $25 at the movies.
So watch it if you are curious but don't have expectation for this version, otherwise you will be disappointed.
I advise you watch the Robert Redford 1970s version before watching this version.",1388793600,,1470,4.4275092936802976

4970599,1,B0067EKYS6,This movie was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  My wife wanted to rent it and I watched it with her.  She didn't like it either.  The plot is all over the map.  The story doesn't develop for a good 45 minutes and when it finally does it still doesn't make sense.  You scratch your head and ask 'I paid $4.99 for this?'.  The dancing and partying at the mansion drags on and on and on.  After several minutes it becomes ridiculous.  Spiderman is a spectator and just observes everything and narrates the movie throughout.  DeCrapri's lines repeatedly refer to him as 'old sport' in a condescending and arrogant manner.  I think we're supposed to put on our Yale and Harvard sweaters and connect with him.  There's rap music mixed in with gangsta brothers driving aroung for an authentic touch of the 1920s.  There's a dumb broad named Daisy and she and Gatsby run over and kill a woman who was Daisy's husband's whore.  Then Gatsby drives away and hides his car in his mansion and wipes off the blood from the front of his car at 4 O'clock in the morning.  Spiderman catches up to him and has a brief conversation with him and Mr Gatsby invites Spiderman to go swimming in his pool.  This is exactly what every hit and run criminal does after he kills someone: goes for a swim in his pool.  The whore's husband is distraught and makes his way to the castle and shoots Gatsby in his pool.  End of movie...eject and dispose.,1388793600,,1442,4.422053231939164

To me, Nick is the key character in Fitzgerald's story - the moral observer of Gatsby, the Buchanans and the time.  Nick's observations are important because he was like the Buchanans.  He went to Yale with Tom.  Daisy was his cousin.  But he is capable of morality the Buchanans lack.  And Gatsby has, in his own way.

Of course I expected Dicaprio to play a good Gatsby, he played the part well but all was lost with the loud music that wasn't the time, this came across as 1/2 a musical and dance movie, lots of flash, not the good drama I expected.  This was a waste, save your time and money, this movie didn't even deserve a 1 star. Watch the 1974 version with Redford, Mia Farrow, Karen Black and Bruce Dern.

4970763,5,B0067EKYS6,"I've also seen the 1949 version of this movie (thought not the 1926 or 1974 versions) and all I remember of it is the last scene, which guarantees an unhappy ending. Since I was a child, I was terribly disappointed and thought the whole thing unfair. As an adult, seeing this version, I now understand the whole thing. In spite of Nick Carroway's declaration that Jay Gatsby is the ""most optimisitic person"" he's ever known, Gatsby appears surprisingly naive for someone who's been through a war and is now in league with the criminal element. As a man in love with a woman who in the end proves too cowardly to openly declare her own love, he appears more enamoured with the memory of that woman  than the real thing.  In other words, Jay Gatsby is a tragedy just waiting to happen...and when it does, it's not even of his own making.  The characters are ones now almost stock and caricatures...the woman he loved and lost and hopes to love again...her profligate husband, a playboy sportsman no longer able to indulge in his favored game thus reverting to drink and women, the wife's best friend who isn't much of one in the end...and the onlooker/confident who arrives almost an innocent himself and is slowly drawn into their world, to document and comment on the events as they unfold.

Spectacle is the watchword here...from the Bauhaus-decorated introduction to the lavish tsunami of sound, color, and artistic  camera shots and angles. The story itself is diminished into something which could've been told in just a few scenes if the epic grandeur of all that cinematography were taken away. The scenes themselves take on a surreal quality with symbolism blatant throughout, and the characters themselves become almost an allegory, the Flaming Youth, the gangster with a heart still in part uncorrupted, the youthful love which didn't die but isn't really as he remembers it. It's a great movie, well-acted, and beautiful to watch. I just wish I'd seen all the others so I could compare it to them.",1387756800,2,2007,4.805797101449276

My daughter and son read the book and the actors did a fantastic job of portraying the characters. They were as they imagined.

It was good, followed Gatsby, but was a little too ""trippy"" for my taste.  I guess, thinking back, the book seemed the same, but maybe I interpreted it differently.  I think Leo did a fantastic job though!

Seriously though, the entire movie was amazing as long as you don't pay attention to anything hitting your eardrums. I cannot stress how important the soundtrack must be to the movie, yet this one seems to butcher the movie at EVERY turn and in almost EVERY scene. A classy movie such as the great Gatsby should not be as tactless as sounding like ""boyz n the hood 1930s"". Complete crap. The noise that was responsible for infuriating my ears subsided long enough for me to get major plot points, but overall ruined the movie completely.

A bit uneven because the techniques that the director used changed somewhat for the last half of the movie. However, some of his techniques really illustrated the feel of the the frenetic, hedonistic times and lives of the book/story. At first I thought that Toby McGuire might not be right for his part but not far into the movie you realize that he is great for the character. Well done depiction of the story. DiCaprio is always good. Superb performances were pulled from everyone.

After the black and white beginning, as soon as color comes in, it is time to leave the theater (and all of your hopes that the film will do the book justice) entirely.  It isn't even the anachronistic Jay-Z soundtrack, the color palette, or even the choices Baz Luhrmann makes in the framing device of writing the story from an asylum.  No, what is lost here entirely is the POINT of F. Scott Fitzgerald's work, which isn't a love story or love triangle, but a metaphor for class and accountability.  This movie has the precise opposite moral from the book.  It turns out if you have enough money to make or sell a movie like this, you are Too Big to Fail and can get away with murdering the classics--just as our antagonists have gotten away with murder in the end.

4970930,4,B0067EKYS6,"If there is one glaring problem of this otherwise very good adaption of Fitzgerald's most famous novel, the post-production music soundtrack editors are the guilty party. For about the first half of the film, the party scenes which provide the backdrop to this story of the Lost Generation and moneyed inequity during 1920's New York is inundated with super sounds of the 21st century, replete with Rap and Hip-Pop. It's as if the filmmakers were afraid that using music from the era, called the Roaring 20's and the Jazz Age for obvious reasons, wouldn't be ""intense"" enough for modern audiences.

The music from this era, which saw the rise of Jazz from its beginnings in New Orleans and into white culture, is some of the most intense party music ever written and recorded. Instead the filmmakers balked and settled on music which would have never existed in the post World War I era. Duke Ellington, Paul Whiteman, Fletcher Henderson and the immortal Louis Armstrong could bellow on acoustic instruments probably with bigger and more robust sounds than any generic hip-pop musician of today. The sounds accompanying the popping of champagne bottles will be forever fused together. Fitzgerald even wrote a book called ""Tales of the Jazz Age"" not ""Tales of the Hip-Pop Age"".

That being said, aside from the questionable music choices, the film is a reasonably good adaption of a story which is nearly un-filmable but has become the 20th-century American novel by which all others are judged. The stand out is without question Leonardo DiCaprio who almost single-handedly saves the entire project. In fact it may be the best DiCaprio performance to date, possibly worthy of an acting nomination. The rest of the cast is strong as well particularly Tobey Maguire as the straight man Nick Carraway.

The movie begins almost like a music video with lots of quick cuts and slow-mo's to the rap and hip-pop which doesn't fit very well with the era it is trying to portray. However, about a third way through, the acting begins to hit its stride and the silly pop music finally starts to wain. Although the story references the crazy parties of the era, it's not about the parties per se, but about the strange love triangle between Daisy Buchanan and her two loves, Jay Gatsby and Tom Buchanan.

Jay Gatsby is the ""new money"" on the block who holds lavish parties where all the elites of New York come to West Egg to douse themselves with champagne (currently illegal, but what the hell), splash around in swimming pools and throw tinsel in the air for reasons not completely explained except possibly to see if it sticks on the many statues on Gatsby's estate. In this film, Gatby's house rings of an Italian manor house a la the Renaissance which might make a member of the Medicis take notice. The narrator is Nick Carraway, living in a humbler house near Gatsby's servants' entrance, who watches but does not participate actively in the events which follow. The Eyes of Dr Eckleburg, like the eyes of God, are there on a poster in the Valley of Ashes, the industrial and working class area between New York City and the suburbs of East and West Egg. The story concerns how ""Nouveau Riche"" Gatsby plans to court his former lover, Daisy Buchanan from the clutches of the Old Money, Tom Buchanan, who is probably worth the equivalent of about 9 Windsors.

Despite a number of reservations, such as the music soundtrack, the strange book ends with Carraway telling his story to a psychiatrist at some kind of half-way house (in the book he is disappointed but not mentally disturbed), and the character of Jordan significantly reduced, the adaption is reasonably good. And the performance by DiCaprio as the anxious ladder-climber who wants desperately to fit into the world of elite money, is outstanding. DiCaprio finds the delicate balance between friendliness, phoniness, and ultimate anxiety which is what makes Gatsby one of the quintessential tragic heroes of American literature. His may be the best portrayal of Gatsby ever on screen thus far. Carey Mulligan also makes a fine Daisy, who is not a bad person but only rather flighty and longing for love and fun.

So when this new version came out (didn't see it in theaters), I took a leap and hoped I'd like this just as much. I saw a lot of parallels in both films (as expected, since they're from the same book). I liked some elements from the older movie more than this one (period music vs. hip-hop of the new movie is no contest...this movie needed period music of the roaring 20s). I new this was a Baz production and expected it to be a bit ""off"", but overall, I enjoyed his take on the book. Casting was well done overall. DiCaprio did quite well as Gatsby, although ""old sport"" got OLD really quick (seemed forced at times).

The story is about unpleasantness  so it works.

If you like it, check out the Robert Redford version. I think you will find it more satisfying. Well, if you DIDN'T like it, I'd stick with the same advice. It's toned down but still makes its points. And it's Redford, not DiCaprio trying to be Redford.",1385337600,2,911,4.481927710843373

4970995,3,B0067EKYS6,"Attempting to adapt a literary classic like F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" to the screen is always a tricky proposition. Just ask the makers of the 1974 version who got their rear ends handed to them for their efforts - by both critics and audiences alike. The risk, of course, is that devotees of the work will balk at any attempt to expand or modernize it beyond what is contained on the printed page. After all, great works of literature exist primarily in the individual's imagination, and the way one reader envisions a particular scene or character is likely NOT how another reader - or filmmaker - sees them. The result is that literary adaptations all too often turn into stuffy affairs, with movie makers taking the safest possible approach to the material in an attempt not to offend anyone while still trying to make the piece work in an entirely different medium.

  All of this is prelude to saying that when it comes to Baz Luhrmann's adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby,"" regardless of how one feels about the final product, one has to at least admire the chutzpah of the effort. (His trumped-up modernized version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" similarly divided audiences in the 1990s).

  A high school English class staple if ever there was one, the highly prescient ""Gatsby,"" published in 1925, is often considered to be THE archetypal novel of the Roaring '20s, focused on the party-like decadence, conspicuous consumption and spiritual emptiness of a decade sandwiched between a Great War on one end and a Great Depression on the other. At the center of the piece stands Jay Gatsby himself, the self-made millionaire who achieves the American Dream through a combination of dreamy-eyed determination and corrupt opportunism (with much of his wealth gleaned through bootlegging and gangsterism). Yet, for all the wealth and material possessions he's managed to accrue for himself, Gatsby (Leonardo Di Caprio) can never find true happiness until he re-connects with the girl of his dreams, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), an alluring Southern-belle he fell in love with while still a penniless officer in the army. In the five years since their last encounter, Daisy, who is willing to go a certain distance with a fantasy romance until the going gets too tough for her, has gone on to marry the brutish womanizer Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Gatsby, in that same period, has bought a mansion across the bay from Daisy's house, hoping against hope that she will one day wander into one of his parties and that they will be able to rekindle their love as if nothing had happened in the interim. It is to this end that he befriends his next door neighbor, Nick Carraway Tobey Maguire), a nave bondsman from the Midwest, who's moved to New York to make his fortune on Wall Street and who also happens to be Daisy's cousin. It is Nick who narrates the tale (in this version from a sanitarium after suffering a mental breakdown from the trauma of the events he's witnessed), claiming to be an objective observer of what's going on around him, but in reality casting moral judgments on the people he encounters all along the way.

  It's easy to understand why the filmmaker was drawn to the material in the first place. With its wild parties and overall air of carefree abandon, the era practically screams out for the Baz Luhrmann treatment. But does the novel? I'm not so sure. The problem is that ""The Great Gatsby"" is about so much more than just unrestrained partying, and the director (along with his co-writer Craig Rearce) often seems oblivious to that fact. Luhrmann typically drenches his film in all sorts of visual razzmatazz, but the result is that the movie is so over-stylized that the characters are all too often reduced to caricatures and the whole thing to the level of a cartoon. The parties themselves become out-of-control orgies as seen through the lens of Simon Duggan's hurdy-gurdy, hyper-kinetic camera. Meanwhile most of Fitzgerald's nuance and subtlety are wiped away in the phantasmagoria. A case in point is the first appearance of Gatsby in the story. In the novel he literally sneaks up on Nick - and us - as just another anonymous and inconspicuous party guest who engages Nick in conversation. In the movie, his entrance is greeted with a literal display of pyrotechnics. The stylization extends to the dcor as well, which often reflects ""Alice in Wonderland"" more than 1920s Long Island. Nick looks like he lives in an enchanted forest attached to Gatsby's mansion, which has more turrets than Blahousie Castle and manicured grounds that would put the Palace of Versaille to shame.

  Viewed another way, however, Luhrmann's approach seems to make a certain amount of sense. The grandiose, over-the-top theatricality, and stiff, yet, at the same time, over-emotive acting are aptly reflective of the silent movies of that era. It's hard to actually evaluate the performances since the actors have clearly been instructed to ham it up as much as possible (especially Edgerton). At times, they come across as little kids engaged in dress-up and playacting. But in the context of this particular film, is that necessarily a bad thing? (I will say that Robert Redford cut a more impressive figure as Gatsby than Di Caprio does here).

  And there's one other thing that can be added to the movie's win column: its overall manic energy, which seems a direct attempt to avoid at all costs replicating the mistakes of the heavy, inert 1974 version.

  Luhrmann knows that he is treading on sacred ground here and he clearly doesn't care. He's going to give us ""The Great Gatsby"" as HE envisions it and to hell with the rest of us. In this age of artistic timidity and over-cautious commercial calculation, that attitude turns out to be both admirable and refreshing when you come to think of it.",1385164800,2,5837,4.872855701311806
4970996,2,B0067EKYS6,"Didn't work for me. Main problem was the way Daisy was written, she just wasn't all that and couldn't figure why any man would worship her. She's pretty, but the writer needed to give her more umph in my opinion. Also not a fan of the voice over, filmmaker seemed to be telling me the story, not showing me. Acting was fine, sets were great. Even if story is about the illusion of love, that people can sometimes fall in love with the idea of love and not the real person, writer should've created a better illusion in Daisy.

Gatsby seems an idiot, pining after some woman who'd willingly stay with an awful husband for the grand lifestyle he could provide.  This is my assessment of Daisy before Gatsby's reappearance. If the writer wanted to soften that opinion he should've introduced her as a loving (though glamorous) mother, then we could've given her an out for staying with her oafish husband for her child's sake. Later, she willingly allows another person take responsibility for a crime she commits. Not appealing. Nothing to her but a pretty face, nice figure and youth, all of which change over time.

Instead of calling the story The Great Gatsby should've been called The Great Nitwit. Like young people everywhere Gatsby fell in love with beauty, and became blinded by his own love of another person, no crime in that. The problem is when he returns, older and presumably with some experience on him, he still insists on seeing Daisy the way he wants to see her, and not as she is. Basically, he failed to vet her character, to kick the tires so to speak. This mistake is excusable in a young person, but really problematic in a 35 to 40 year old mature man, apparently willing to risk his freedom for someone who doesn't deserve the sacrifice. In fact, if a person asks another or allows another to make such a sacrifice that should be a red flag right there.

The audience needed to be seduced by Daisy, as apparently Gatsby is. The writer absolutely needed to attach us to her, so we'd be duped, just as Gatsby is duped but really Gatsby dupes himself. The story is an example of self delusion so I don't understand ""The Great"" part of the title (maybe another viewer can enlighten me). Since we're presented with nothing but Daisy's outer beauty, no way did I find her impressive or noteworthy in any way, and because Gatsby does everything out of his love for her, no way could I attach to him: a fully mature man who makes foolish, overly romantic/dramatic gestures out of blind love, or worse, stupidity and/or hubris.

Gatsby is after all pursuing another man's wife, and they have a child, so he's breaking up a family.  By making the husband awful, the writer tries to soften what Gatsby is trying to do, but basically Gatsby wants what he wants and is willing to bust up a marriage to get it. The audience is shown that it wasn't much of a marriage, but apparently it was enough for Daisy, who showed no signs of leaving before Gatsby's appearance. Given his age and life experience, Gatsby should've known to leave all that mess alone.  He was far past 21, and yet refused to see reality (I hate when a writer presents a dumb character; a story can't recover from a dumb hero), and the filmmakers make Daisy seem more a lump of coal than a multi-faceted diamond, so it wasn't communicated why life without her wouldn't be worth living.

This story needed to present Daisy as the essence of feminine appeal, in beauty and character, to explain and justify Gatsby's choices: she powers him, he moves the story. A weak Daisy provides no engine. Stars need to better assess screenplays not only for their own part but for the parts of the other characters who motivate them. A star's character does not operate in a vacuum, and is part of a whole, the most important part, but still just a part. Stars must look at the whole and question how all parts fit together. If not, you get stories like this: a hero who looks dumb for throwing it all away for an unworthy woman. A smart star would've looked at the Daisy character and insisted she be better developed to make her more appealing to the audience, not to compete with the hero, but so that when the hero makes the ultimate sacrifice (give up his freedom for her), the audience understands why he'd do such a thing. As written, we have an unappealing dumb hero, and nobody wants a dumb hero/heroine. We need better script assessment, and someone with enough clout to insist changes be made to a script when lesser characters aren't written strongly enough to carry their weight. What's a sign of a superior screenstory? When all characters bring added value. The main mistake here was underwriting Daisy.",1385164800,,4684,4.587813620071684

4970999,4,B0067EKYS6,"THE GREAT GATSBY  1974

To really understand this film, or the novel behind, you have to keep in mind the alternative story that D.H. Lawrence tells us in Women in Love. In the same way we are dealing with love in the upper class of the very rich  before the First World War and then after before the big crisis of 1929. I will not compare the two here but the two films also came out in the same period, the early 1970s after the 1968 political and generational crisis. They both carry the denunciation of the upper class.

We are telling the story from an outside point of view but yet close to the protagonists. The story teller, Mr. Nick Carraway, is a neighbor of Mr. Jay Gatsby and a bond seller in Wall Street, New York. Nothing to do with present time golden boys, the traders in Brokerage firms. Well-off but definitely not rich and anyway with no rich parents. Yet he is the cousin of another woman who is from an extremely rich family, married to an extremely rich man. Gatsby is the black sheep in the neighborhood.

He is from an extremely poor family. He managed to get an Oxford education after 1918 because he became an officer and was heavily decorated during the war and he then took advantage of veterans privileges. He had also the chance to fall in the hands of a certain Meyer Wolfsheim who introduced him to business, though we are never told what that business really is. We can imagine, due to the speed with which he became rich (less than eight years) that it had to be in some financial speculation in the 1920s. That period is clearly identified with the paraphernalia of the time and with the music, including the dancing, including the famous song Charleston. Note that Jay might not be a real first name, but an initial and that the name Gatsby is not the real name of the man who was the son of  a certain Mr. Gatz we see at the end. Note too that the name Wolfsheim is of course meaningful and the main principle of this man is we can be a friend of a man when he is alive, but not when he is dead.

At the end of WWI, Jay Gatsby, alias Major Gatz, fell in love with Daisy, a rich girl. But he was a poor man. She fell in love with him on a short-lived whim and he fell in love with her forever. But a rich girl does not marry a poor boy, as she says so well. So he disappears to build a fortune and she got married to a rich boy and became Mrs. Daisy Buchanan.  She had promised to wait but rich girls never wait.

When he is finally rich he manages to get close to her and then to be introduced to her by her cousin, Nick Carraway, and before he had tried to attract her attention by having enormous garden parties every week end in that summer of 1926 or 1927. She eventually falls in the trap.

The rest is to be discovered in the film, or the book.

The morality, bad word, the immorality of this film is that in spite of the American Dream, rich people attract and mix with rich people and poor people can only eventually be accepted when they are rich. The second lesson is that rich people with a rich pedigree can always manage to get through any crime or accident or whatever particularly by pointing at another of their class but that does not have the rich pedigree they have. This immorality can even be worse: rich men can have as many poor mistresses they will furnish with some luxury as much, and as many, as they want or can afford. But a rich woman is not supposed to have any affair with a rich man of any sort, and she will not condescend to have an affair with a poor man. It would not be in anyway anything but a short and exciting sexual episode that would be doomed even before it starts, and like the praying mantis she would destroy the poor lover after using it.

In other words a woman is the property of her husband but in no way the husband is the property of his wife, and social inequality is absolute in the USA, just like in Great Britain, in the 1920s just the way Henry James described it in his novels more than thirty years before. Nothing has changed.

The narrator is able to express this immorality and that is the only moral element in this film, and novel. Morality is on the side here of the upper middle class, and a lower stratum in that upper middle class. That means there may be some hope for such a society that is doomed because the rich do not care for their neighbors in all the meanings of this word. They only care for their money and the gossips that can be aired around them about them.

This older film shows these elements with great care but at the same time it is obvious Jay Gatsby is not natural as a rich man. He is not able to play the game properly: he is awkward, he is shy, he is inconsiderate in his presents and in his lavish help he may give to someone who is trying to make him realize one of his intentions or desires. One hundred white roses are not even enough in such a situation and he very well may send one thousand. The dialogue is good too in the fact that Jay Gatsby is the only one who has a linguistic idiosyncratic tick and he calls every man old sport and such an Oxfordian tic shows in him a rather recent integration in the class of the super rich: he cuts a role, a character, a behavior and sticks to it: he believes in a way the tuxedo makes the money aristocrat. And he is wrong: the money aristocrat is in the careless and nonchalant way he wears the tuxedo and that cannot be imitated.

All together a beautiful but cruel film on the egocentric selfishness of the super rich born super rich.

4971002,3,B0067EKYS6,"I rented this movie with a sense of trepidation.

As with many people, ""The Great Gatsby"" is an almost-holy text to me. I have an emotional investment in this book such that butchering it for a movie would enrage me in a way that messing with ""The Hunger Games"" does not. On the other hand, I love a lot of what Baz Luhrmann has done. I think that Moulin Rouge and Romeo+Juliet were spectacular. The themes and setting of Gatsby definitely lend themselves to Luhrmann's over-the-top-style.

Parts of this movie were every bit as bad as I feared. Nick, as a character, was butchered. The ""added story"" was unnecessary and dumb. Acting-wise, it felt like Tobey Macguire just stood around, star-eyed as the other actors moved around him. I also thought that the ""modern soundtract"" was a bit self-conscious in some places. It worked in the party scenes, but not so well in other bits. I do appreciate what Luhrmann was trying to do, however, and it wasn't entirely painful.

This film contains some real brilliance in bits. The movie was exceptionally well-cast. I never jumped on the Carey Mulligan bandwagon, but she was fantastic as Daisy. Her portrayal added a lot to my understanding of the character, and Leonardo was, as usual, perfect as Gatsby. Visually, the party scenes and Gatsby's house were spot-on.

""The Great Gatsby"" centers on the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a wealthy and illustrious man who throws extravagant parties and who has a sort of mystique set to his name - nobody really knowing his past nor where his fame and wealth truly came from. It is the mysterious past of Jay Gatsby that drives the film forward and what keeps the audience in dazed wonderment as the story unfolds.

In Fitzgerald's own words from the novel, ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" The film ""The Great Gatsby"" has been one of many representations of the novel, each one having different feels and imagery, but in my humble opinion this has been the best. The depiction of society gave me the impression of an exciting lifestyle marked by a rapidly growing market and degradation through cheap alcohol. Society, at the time, couldn't have seemed more alive and booming. It is through this period that the story of the great Gatsby is revealed.

The novel, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, was written in the year 1925 and soon became a legacy, an inspiration, a novel of great value. It centers on idealism, resistance to change, change being an enemy unto mankind, as well as the american dream that ""we can have it all."" It paints a vivid picture of the 'roaring 20s' and the beautiful jazz age in the great Big Apple. This picturesque period is the subject of many novels and films, having no shortage of unique stories and myths.

Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Joel Edgerton, and the beautiful Carey Mulligan, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a colorful and intriguing take on the novel. The film was directed by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia), who is well known for his use of bright colors and fast-paced editing. He created a visual symphony to represent this thrilling story of love and riches, but, unfortunately, Luhrmann's distinctive taste has made the film subject to some negative reviews as well as low numbers in theaters.

But can I say the same as those film critics who claim that the film is too flashy or too contemporary for a fictional story based in the 1920s? No. To me, the story was told as it should have been told to audiences of today. The actors generated personalities similar to that which is found in the novel, the story was gripping and told by the character named Nick Carraway as it is also done in the novel, and the imagery and symbolism was portrayed just as it was to be imagined. A novel of such caliber deserves to be visually told excitedly and thoroughly and should not suffer from lack of imagination.

I came to believe that the early material was deliberately designed to grate on viewer nerves, so when Gatsby appears and the ambiance becomes more serene, the audience will relax and see Gatsby as the suddenly appearing focus of ultimate handsomeness and coherent speech.  As the movie unfolded, I began guessing that those who put it together must have intensely studied the 1949, 1974 and 2000 versions of the same story and guided the 2013 result toward an evolved version that omitted the shortfalls that critics and reviewers assigned to the past three versions, then added strengths coming from advances in movie making often wasted on violence for the sake of violence.

The 1949 version did concentrate more on the story but it deviated from the book, this version is true to the book's story and the cinematography is great and the acting good, but the music could have been better chosen.",1384214400,,430,4.671052631578948
4971142,2,B0067EKYS6,"As a teacher of literature, I'm very familiar with the Great Gatsby as a book and from its earlier film incarnation starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow.  Overall, I was unimpressed with this film version, and in certain moments, I was actually angry with it.  It seemed to me that the screenwriter felt superior to F. Scott Fitzgerald to the point that he felt he had to not only present the story but also explain it.  It felt very ""dumbed down"" to me.  Since I've read the book a good number of times, I could immediately recognize when a line of narration came directly from the book and when it was added material whose purpose was to manipulate the audience to see the story only in one particular way -- the way the screenwriter sees it.  I felt that the movie took us places that Fitzgerald never intended us to go, especially in its depiction of Nick Caraway as having been severely damaged from his acquaintance with Gatsby.  According to the movie, Nick is now a horrible, bitter alcoholic, in need of constant psychiatric therapy.  Seriously, if this were the case, how could Nick look back at his friend as the ""great"" Gatsby?

Allow me to say one good thing about this movie.  It did have a beautiful look to it.  Visually, it depicted the world of Gatsby to be an airbrushed version of life.  I feel the ""look"" was consistent with the imagery of the book.

Now, having said that, I didn't like the ""sound"" of the movie.  The Great Gatsby is the defining novel of ""The Jazz Age"".  Why, then, was it necessary to supply the movie with music by the Black-Eyed-Peas?  Their music isn't bad, and I can see how it might have been ""inspired"" by jazz, but it just seemed out of sync with the story.  It was a distraction to me.

I don't fault the actors at all.  Each was well-chosen for his or her respective role and skilled at the craft of acting.  I just despised the way the book's wording had been tampered with and that the director had a skewed interpretation of the original story.

F. Scott Fitzgerald was a great writer.  The Great Gatsby is a great story.  This film did not live up to the same level of greatness.",1384214400,3,2135,4.434447300771208
4971143,3,B0067EKYS6,"Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of Nabokov's novel ""Lolita"" strayed so far from the original that Nabokov immediately disowned it.  Over four decades later, ""Lolita"" was re-made, starring Jeremy Irons and faithful to the novel -- and it was almost impossible to watch.  Movies too loyal to the original novels are hard to watch in general, but the truth of the matter is that neither ""Lolita"" and ""The Great Gatsy"" were very good novels to begin with.

""The Great Gatsy"" is a novel that everyone had to endure in high school, as high school teachers love it for its bloated metaphors, vast imagery, and empty symbolism.  The main character is Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who dreamed himself a fantastical life to pursue the woman of his dreams, but the real protagonist is Nick Carraway who straddles West Egg and East Egg, old money and new money, and finds himself disgusted and disillusioned by both, but strangely drawn to Gatsby.

This new film adaptation of the novel is both carelessly unfaithful and zealously loyal to the novel.  On one hand, the movie is too extravagant, so great is the exaggeration of America's Jazz Age that the movie feels campy.  On the other hand, the movie follows the main plot of the novel, which is neither interesting nor clever.

That said, both Tobey Maguire and Carey Mulligan offer excellent performances, and are each in their own distinctive way charismatic on the screen.  Unfortunately, the real disappointment is Leonardo DiCaprio, who has recently played a string of larger than life characters -- Howard Hughes and Jay Edgar Hoover, for example -- but in being asked to play the greatest larger than life character of them all he offers a meek and understated performance.

The film's main failing is that there's no chemistry at all between DiCaprio and Mulligan, and we're left wondering why the two are attracted to each other in the first place.  Mulligan is listless and lazy, stupid and careless -- and we just don't understand how someone so devoid of charm and personality can enter into DiCaprio's heart until it consumes his being.  It's endearing that a man who is constantly re-inventing himself and living in a castle in the sky could be so utterly devoted to a mundane woman so that he's left sweaty and speechless in front of her -- but it's just not believable.

The movie is like Gatsby himself -- unsure of himself, sweating and grasping for that ephemeral green light that may or may not exist across the harbor.",1384214400,,2489,4.855791962174941
4971144,3,B0067EKYS6,"I want to say 3.5 stars.  The pluses in this film as opposed to the 1974 film would be Dicaprio's Gatsby is much better than Redford's.  Decaprio was darker and I think that added an element that Redford's ""nicer"" Gatsby failed to.  The downside; Mia Farrow will always be Daisy.  (If only there was a way to cast young Mia Farrow opposite of Leonardo...*sigh*)  Toby was a much better Nick than whoever played Nick in the 1974 film.  Tobey just showed the right amount of innocent awe at all that was happening around him than the guy from Law and Order.  The other characters though just seemed very throw-away in this new version though.

The party scene was way over the top for what would have been possible at the time but given that this is for a 2011 audience I can let that slide.  But on the other hand it did really bring out the grotesque opulence of gluttony of the time.  Actually I maybe more on the fence on that.

It's a good movie but not great and doesn't really live up to all the hype generated at the time of release but it came pretty close.",1384128000,,1064,4.296482412060302
4971145,4,B0067EKYS6,"It has very good acting (C'mon, Dicaprio), although Tobey Maguire did his usual excellent work (perhaps better than Dicaprio) and Joel Edgerton as Tom gave an excellent performance. Perhaps because it was written in the same era, the woman's parts seem rather thin. I love Carey Mulligan and Isla Fischer, but they were primarily foils, the roles did not seem to match the talent. The movie had the Baz Lurhman crispness and snap to the visuals, but dare I say It? Perhaps, just perhaps, the writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald is getting a bit dated? It just doesn't seem to translate well, might just be me. By now, I've just seen the Gilded Age spoiled decadent American Royalty caught in their own lifestyle trap thing before.",1384128000,,725,4.761904761904762

4971160,4,B0067EKYS6,"The DVD gets an extra star because there is an entire extra DVD of extras! The stuff on there is all pretty good but you also realize how much Baz Luhrmann has lost the plot when you hear him talk about the movie. Basically, the guy is in dire need of someone (such as a good editor) to reign him in. The background on how he melded modern music with the music of the Jazz Age is interesting until you realize here's a guy from Australia (where bands he should know being about the right age to have come of musical age post-New Wave such as the Hoodoo Gurus, Crystal Set, Celibate Rifles, Porcelain Bus came from) has far too lamestream tastes as beyond The XX, the stuff he thinks is cutting edge is basically for the hipster college radio crew at best and the Jay-Z types at worst.

That out of the way, I almost fast-forwarded the entire movie as it fell into two big traps--voiceover narration (the lazy person's way to tell a story onscreen) and had Tobey Maguire on far too long before Leonardo DiCaprio showed up and the thing finally came to life. (In the extras, check out the PBS doc and the still of F. Scott Fitzgerald in side portrait and Tobey looks like a dead ringer from the side).

The colors in this movie are an assault on the eyes and only after reading it was released in 3-D did I figure out why all the fast zooms across bays or down roads were going on. Now it makes sense--it was for 3-D effect.

Then in the extras you learn it was all pretty much shot on green screen. It does shows in a very odd unnatural setting especially to the party scenes in the Gatsby mansion. Everything just looks that much off.

Then the B-team has been rolled out in the bit parts. We get a B-list Michelle Williams in Carey Mulligan, an B version of Amy Adams in Isla Fisher and a younger Kristin Scott Thomas B version in Elizabeth Debicki. Have a look on imdb at their pics. I swear they are all doppelgangers for those A-list actresses. OK, Debicki is a bit of a stretch but go with me on that.

It's an entertaining movie but once the car accident happens I grew incredibly bored and started fast-forwarding as it just seemed to lose any momentum. Look, The Great Gatsby has been done to death onscreen and off-, did we really need another version? Plus Baz Luhrmann? Seriously? He is a musical dance guy. Last I looked The Great Gatsby is a novel not a musical play (yes, Broadway has had its claws in it as such and well, sorry, not a fan of the stage or musicals in any form).

Honestly, I'd like to challenge Baz to do a movie involving no music or dance. Let's see him show off his directing chops because he falls back on this way too much.

Having said all this and stated that it is entertaining for much of it, I will say that without DiCaprio this thing would have been a farce. He's the only thing in it worth watching. So hats off to The Aviator.",1383955200,,2871,4.266544117647059

4971193,5,B0067EKYS6,"I've heard others say that the over the top CGI makes the movie seem unrealistic and hard to watch, but I think it emphasizes the theme of dreaming and Gatsby's dream of his perfect life with Daisy. Luhrmann does a quality job of embodying the spirit of Fitzgerald's novel without seeming like he copied the text word for word -- when there are direct quotes, it is a special perk for those viewers who know and love the original material.

Luhrmann's choice of music and score is unconventional but impressive. Even with multiple diverse genres on the soundtrack, the album is centered around the themes of Gatsby and so the collection of songs somehow works and flows together. The only drawback of the stellar soundtrack is that, having listened many times to the songs, the lyrics became a distraction while they were played in the background of the movie itself.

Leo and Carey Mulligan (and the rest of the cast, for that matter) brought their A-game for this movie. All of them succeeded at making me hate every character plus have a strange sadness towards Gatsby - key emotions that Fitzgerald seemed to desire for his readers to have after finishing the book.

this is a STORY FROM LUHRMANS immagination that has nothing to do with the novel we know as The Great Gatsby.

While I like Leo, there is no nuance, look, mannerism or charm he could insinuate that would make it a worthwhile picture. His use of the term, ""old sport"" which is used throughout the film, is forced -- unbelieveable to his portrayal of Gatsby. If anything about the character should come smoothly, it's that term. The real story should be in-depth character studies -- in this film, the only story is showing off how far they can push computers. For all the computer-generated spectacle of backdrop and set design, this may as well have been an animated movie. Also, a soundtrack in keeping with the time period would have been a lot less distracting. Can't believe I will never get those 2 hours of my life back.",1383523200,4,819,4.616438356164384

BUT, to my eternal regret, after suffering through the Buzzkill Luridman version on DVD, it hit me how grossly I had underestimated the Aussie knack for hideous kitsch. When compared to Luridman's Fantasia on a Theme by Inspired by Fitzgerald, the problematic 1974 Gatsby becomes the very model of refinement. At least the '74 version has a script by Francis Ford Coppola, who apparently did actually read the original novel.

Everything we see here suggests that Luridman was much too discombobulated on a combo of pills, powders, pot or whatever to maintain the concentration to even listen to the audiobook for such a very short novel. His movie is ludicrously over the top, utterly tone deaf, and quite possibly displays either:
(a.) the tackiest art direction in the entire history of Hollywood or
(b.) the worst, most cluttered and absurdly excessive CGI,
either (or both) of which make for rather a remarkable achievement.

The casting is absurdly awful throughout, with the minor exception of Carey Mulligan, who does marginally more resemble a brain-dead Daisy Buchanan than Mia Farrow did in the '74 Robert Redford vehicle, where at least Redford had quasi-charming moments as Gatsby (and wore the Ralph Lauren wardrobe reasonably well). Leo DiCaprio's Gatsby, when not preoccupied with doubling for the Pillsbury Dough Boy, demonstrates somewhat less charisma than a cardboard cut-out surrounded by a gaggle of gargoyles, and to call Toby Maguire ""lame"" playing Nick Carraway would be truly unkind to genuinely handicapped and disabled people.",1383004800,3,1658,5.159851301115242

4971417,5,B0067EKYS6,"Background.  Have not read the original book.  Saw the Redford version, but so many years ago, its a blur, though a beautiful blur.
  At first found the 3D effects a bit ""contrived"" in the first 5 minutes or so....but finally, I just let the lush and evocative imagery draw me in, like a beautiful wave on a hot Mexican beach and I began to truly enjoy it without holding back due to its unusual style.
  Perhaps only 3D could do such a story proud. I suspect F. Scott Fitzgerald would love this version.
  (Wouldn't it be interesting to see this director (Baz Luhrmann), pull off Romeo and Juliet in 3D....and watch Shakespeare react to his interpretation?)Oops...I found out this director did do a version of Romeo and Juliet, but don't know if its 3D.  (Somehow, I doubt it).
  I suspect he'd say: ""Yummy!  Truly brilliant and delicious and decadent and visually sumptuous.""
Ever since I saw Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""  when a child star, I have found him captivating.
I don't believe he's ever won an Oscar.  (I am totally clueless as to why, unless the other stars just won't vote for him.  I feel he simply reeks talent).
  The fight scene in that hot hotel room was as real as if it had happened in my own living room: Thundering.  In your face;  and ripped from the core of his soul.
  I thought Carey Mulligan who played Daisy was good, but I do prefer Mia Farrow better in the earlier version.
Still, she was  gorgeous and believable in this  role.
  Artistically, the sets,  costumes,  cars,  cityscapes,  houses, were spectacular and worth the price of admission in and of themselves.  It seems no penny was spared to bring an ""over the top"" non stop fiesta to life.  All bit actors did splendidly.
  Tobey Maguire did a wonderful job too. I felt he was almost as good in this as he was in ""Cider House Rules"".
His character was not as fully developed by the screenwriter, but his acting was brilliant.
  Having seen this version, I now want to re-watch the older Gatsby film again.  I know that each will stand on its merits.  Each was created using the technology and talents of the artists and visionaries of their time.  (I often hate ""remakes"" but this is one that was worth doing.)  The message burns strongly  and the visual impact in certain ways has more power than even Avatar did with the 3-D effects.  That is because in Avatar everything is fantasy, whereas this is more true to life.
  I am not the kind of person who generally watches a movie again and again.  This will be an exception.
I am really glad we purchased the 3-D version and can easily do that whenever we feel the need.
  One of the reasons people go to the movies is to escape their own lives.
  The Great Gatsby, and I mean THIS particular Leonardo DiCaprio version is that perfect getaway.

I recommend this movie to everyone I know. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie definatly should. :)",1382659200,,611,4.464285714285714
4971424,3,B0067EKYS6,"but the second half was better.

Leonardo DiCaprio has gotten much better looking...he's lost the baby face and looks like a MAN now.  He actually has chemistry with Carey Mulligan, which he and Kate Winslet did not have together. As he plays Gatsby, he's anxious, energetic, sad, nervous, romantic and devoted...Robert Redford's Gatsby just seemed hyper.

Carey Mulligan's Daisy is wimpy, weak and unlikeable.  Mia Farrow's Daisy was flighty, flaky, shallow and unlikeable.

Tobey Maguire...is just Tobey Maguire.  When speaking to his doctor, he seems to weirdly emphasize every single word.  His characterization of Nick is not realistic.

The first half of the movie, I did not care for the rap music, the scenes jumping around, or the way everyone spoke as quickly as they could (making the closed captioning go faster too). I also did not like all the crazy, careening, fast driving around..but maybe they were trying to make a point how careless these people were.

The second half was more the story of Daisy and Jay...Jay's desire for Daisy's love and his love (or infatuation) for her. Daisy just seemed to go along with him...not having much gumption to make up her mind either way.  It seemed strange that she would refuse to lie about ever loving her husband (which made her husband feel triumphant), but she refused to say that she did not love him now.

Did Jay only want Daisy because of what she represented to him? Success and that she came from a good family? Did he only love what he thought that she was, not seeing her true nature? Did he only become rich to win her back?

It's worth watching for DiCaprio's performance, I think.",1382659200,,1652,4.798586572438163

Sure,the new Gatsby,played by Leonardo D'Caprio is a very good performance but it is Mia Farrow,in the original film,whose performance is Oscar worthy! I'm not knocking Cary Mulligan,as she does an adequate job but it was Mia's Daisy that stoled the entire movie! Mia was able to capture the subtle nuances of a very spoiled woman,and yet a woman pure of heart. This is tough to do and,in my opinion Mia wins hands down.",1382659200,,527,4.739130434782608

My girlfriend liked the music, I didn't.  This movie is full of music that was popular like six months ago...  Knowing this I am sure that this movie will feel very dated in a few years because of all this early 2013 music.  I don't understand why they didn't just use music that was popular in the time period this movie actually takes place in.  My gf doesn't feel the same way, she loved all the songs and thinks I'm dumb for thinking that this bad pop music will date the movie.

I recommend this movie to anyone that likes good, fun, stylized, drama.  This movie has a lot of each of those qualities, however be aware that this is a tragedy, so don't expect a happy ending or anything.

4971439,2,B0067EKYS6,"Pros: I read the book before I saw the movie, and it follows pretty close. In fact, the movie cleared up a few things for me that were not clear when I read the book. The mansions and cars were pretty to look at. The acting was good at times.

Cons: The CG effects were visually jarring. The graphics did  not look real and did not convey a sense of the era to me. All of the scenes with the cars driving looked fake to me, from the speed they were driving to the way they weaved in and out of traffic. I think the least realistic scenes may have been when the cars drove over the bridge.

The director used the optometrist billboard as a backdrop for way too many scenes. In one scene it was used behind the girl getting hit by the car and because of the perspective angle it looked like she was flying fifty feet in the air. Another scene panned over the billboard across the water. Wait, wasn't the billboard next to road, or was it in front of the lake?

The music was terrible. The party scenes were blaring hip hop to convey what was supposed to be a roaring 20's party. It was so out of character it was off-putting.

At times I didn't think the acting was particularly good. Some of the characters didn't seem real or convincing. Based on the many poor decisions that went into making this movie, I am guessing the poor acting was because of poor direction.",1382572800,2,1365,4.234615384615385

4971461,5,B0067EKYS6,"Baz Luhrmann's version of Fitzgerald's classic ""The Great Gatsby"" sizzles! Each scene and every frame is hot to the touch. The characters are well drawn, and the actors are perfectly cast: Maguire's Nick wavers between wide-eyed innocence and wearied ennui; Mulligan's Daisy is just the right mix of sadness and whimsy; Fisher's Myrtle is brassier than a jazz band; Edgerton's Tom intimidates and infuriates; and DiCaprio's Gatsby nails the melancholy hidden beneath a mask of dapper calm.

Has there been a brighter, more colorful movie? We're treated to a madcap parade of star-spangled evening gowns and party dresses drizzled in glitter. Meanwhile, Jazz, the maddening pulse of this film, thumps and trumps with the occasional interlude from Jay-Z, Fergie, and other pop stars.

The first half is a terrific surge of energy, color, and frenzy. Three quarters the way through, however, we see the film sober up. As a well-executed matching of form and function, the audience, like Gatsby, starts to see through the facade of tinsel and lights. The gleaming, thumping bacchanalia fizzles out, and Gatsby's castle for the first time feels ""too-big,"" empty, and overwrought. The dream dissolves and colors fade while our title character's lifelong journey takes center stage.

I'm hard-pressed to name a film as bright and beautiful as Luhrmann's ""Great Gatsby."" Fitzgerald's book (his legacy to Great American Novels) deserves nothing less than all the color, sound, and well-managed mania of this adaptation. Always criticized for his cinematic excesses, Luhrmann here has harnessed the frantic and fantastic to give us a vision true to Fitzgerald's story while at the same time expanding it to fill the widescreen.",1382400000,,1717,5.305147058823529

Lurhman, however, got some important elements of the book even though he didn't seem to get others (e.g., in the book Gatsby's gangland connections are hinted at, not shown, as, for example, in henchmen beating up a guest outside the gates).  Carey Mulligan made me see why Nick and Gatsby both might have found her more than a bubble-head, even though she remains true to form, and Leonardo diCaprio--so unlike what I've always pictured Gatsby to be--was surprisingly effective.  Tobey MacGuire, on the other hand, seemed too hapless to be Nick, and, while the psychiatric setting framework made it easy to translate the narrator's voice to film, Nick is the last person I'd see needing to be institutionalized.

Scott Fitzgerald, observing life for the novel he will eventually write, ""The Great Gatsby"".  I was anxious to view this DVD on my giant 54"" HDTV.  Even that screen size didn't pick up all of those glamourous gowns and costumes, or details of the homes' backgrounds...but I did enjoy the movie.  I didn't want to like it because I felt that Robert Redford's 1979 version made Gatsby the vision you would expect a gazillionaire to be.

Very colorful, good cinematography, great soundtrack.

The key role of Nick Carraway is wasted on Tobey Maguire, who brings nothing at all, besides some rather terse narration.

The music is totally anachronistic and completely out of place. It makes you think you're watching some commercial for liquor or something.
 One thing's for sure: you can't have it both ways in a period film like this. Music by Jay-Z might sell some tickets, but will date this thing terribly in a few years. They should have taken a cue from HBO's Boardwalk Empire by having modern theme music at the beginning and end, and having all source music within the film be true to the period.

Di Caprio is very good, but the girl who plays Daisy is utterly forgettable. I can't even remember the actress' name.
Hollywood may never get this one right, but the film is watchable to a degree. The 70's version with Redford has it's flaws, but it's better than this one.",1381708800,,1020,4.624309392265193

4971527,1,B0067EKYS6,"While visually pleasing, this version of Gatsby is an atrocity in every other way.

They could not have chosen a worse soundtrack - I mean, this is the 1920s, and they're playing hip hop and rap? They were clearly going for a ""Knight's Tale""-style approach, but they failed miserably. Watching the flappers dancing to Jay-Z and Andre 3000 literally made my jaw drop in horror and shock. Completely ruined the 1920s atmosphere in every scene with modern tunes.

Cary Mulligan is adorable and likeable... she completely fails to capture Daisy's lofty carelessness and arrogance. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, who is an amazingly talented actor, he was badly miscast as well. He was, I fear, too old and serious. He simply does not portray young Jay Gatsby's naivete and optimism, and those are his most important qualities! Toby Maguire is the only one who seemed to fit his role.

The story plods along and does not entice or reel you in. I found it to be overly lengthy and not entirely true to the book. There were a lot of pointless and neverending close-ups of raindrops, leaves, wine glasses... just about every inanimate, insignificant object they used on that set got some quality time with the camera, and then, of course, they shorten the characters' scenes - because the LAST thing they wanted was to cut back on those 5-minute artistic stills.

The movie is, overall, a huge disappointment and 2 hours I will never get back. The people who made it clearly thought they were making a masterpiece and they overshot every aspect of this film, which should have been great, but was drastically exploited in the name of cinematic art.

The movie is visually appealing but it falls especially flat when modern music is crowbarred into the party scenes.  Tobey Maguire spends the entire film with an earnest grin and Carey Mulligan really disappoints as one of the great female characters in American literary history. DiCaprio does well with the mysterious Gatsby, and it's painful to watch him unable to reconcile himself to Daisey's choice, but this isn't enough to save the film.

Redford is a brilliant actor, but the film he starred in was dull and awful. Mia Farrow as Daisy was terrible. So I was a bit tense about renting the new version with Leo and Carey. All for nothing because the film was brilliant. Baz did such a great job directing it. The actors in this film were brilliant. The music in the film was beautiful as well, although I wasn't too fond of the rap music in between some scenes, but that's ok. It wasn't over bearing. Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful"" song was placed on several scenes in different version and it brought me to tears at some points. Even though I knew that Jay Gatsby would die in the end of the film, I was still bawling like a baby. That's the power of Leo's acting. I didn't even react when Redford's version died.

The story by F. Scott Fitzgerald is really compelling and this version of the movie does a good job of connecting you to the characters.

4971562,3,B0067EKYS6,"I want to handle this review delicately and accurately, because I think there is a lot to say about this movie, good and bad. I don't know if I'm the only one who picked up on this or felt this way, but I thought the first 1/3 of this move was approaching brilliant. The stylized cuts and fast paced story and movement were kind of brilliant. If it could have maintained that kind of power and verve, this movie would have been as good as, or better than Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece, ""Romeo + Juliet."" The first 1/3 could have been even better, but it was still pretty great.

However, I believe, due to the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the fact that Luhrmann sort of ran out of vigor, the last 2/3 seemed really pretty slow and like it was just trudging along. Luhrmann was handed a pretty bland 2/3 of a story by Fitzgerald, but he also didn't rise to the occasion, and make it powerful either. I don't think it's a plot spioler to say that the whole last 2/3 of this movie is waiting to see Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) just work up the nerve to tell a girl that he loves her. Kind of slow, no? The girl is played by Carey Mulligan, and she is beautiful, and has a great face for the role, but there isn't much there, character wise. Another thing is that I personally don't really think that the book ""The Great Gatsby"" was really a masterpiece. I've read it, and I actually thought it was pretty paint by numbers and the dialogue and characters were kind of cardboard cutouts. So the movie slows to a crawl waiting for Gatsby to tell the girl that he loves her, and then the ending is crammed with a bunch of completely improbable events. The story and movie are so crammed with fake situations and characters that you don't really feel much for them. It is such a shame because the beginning was so interesting, and if the whole movie could have maintained and capitalized on the mystery and intrigue that is built in the first 1/3 of the story, it could have actually been pretty spectacular. However, the book itself doesn't really tell the awesomest, most coherent story, and Luhrmann would have had to go pretty far off the page to tell a better story. I don't know what it was, but I didn't really care when we got to the climax of the story.

DiCaprio (who I usually don't really like in roles like this) surprised me by doing a fair job. However, he really needs to drop that ever so slight New York (I guess) accent that he tries to do in so many of his movies. It doesn't sound subtle and believable, like I think he is shooting for, it just sounds like he made a half hearted effort to do a New York accent and gave up. He talks in his normal voice, and then every 16th word or so, he throws on a half New York accent. Yikes! It drives me crazy. However, in many scenes, he really showed some tension on his face, like his character was really trying to set things right, and that was nice. He didn't seem exactly like the brushed and polished mysterious figure that you'd want him to be, but overall he did a good job. He also didn't 100% nail the ""old sport""s like you'd love it if he did, but he did good overall character work, and he was ok. I will, however, scream if he gets an Oscar for this role, and you know that somewhere out there, between Hollywood, London, and Australia, there was a better man who could have played the role of Gatsby.

Overall, this movie dropped the ball on the mystery and intrigue, but a huge chunk of that was Fitzgerald's fault, and the first 1/3 I thought was actually pretty awesome. Overall, I give it a low B, C range for a grade.",1381190400,,3591,4.293510324483776

4971568,5,B0067EKYS6,"I thought this movie was extraordinary...of epic proportion. I don't really care for the story so much, but the movie itself was fabulous. Great acting, photography, special effects. Well worth watching.",1381104000,,203,5.580645161290323
4971569,5,B0067EKYS6,"This version of The Great Gatsby catches the depth of Gatsby character, the many moods and shifts that make him what he is..basically a kind of charlatan and a person who wants the American Dream to come true for him and for Daisy. It cannot come true and she is ultimately relegated to the discard pile, while Gatsby must atone for things another person did, all very messy and a part of the one-dimensional life he seeks to escape at every turn. Gatsby, as DECaprio plays him, is enigmatic but finally deep at the surface only, and his is America.

Visually stunning with music that propells the action into the depths of the 20s and at the same time takes us into the present which is passing away as quickly as a glass of champagne, as quickly as fortunes will disappear at the end of the 20s. Already, as the film opens, Gatsby is obsolete.

Leonardo DiCaprio once more gives a stellar performance. He is that kind of actor who is a genuine artist with his timing, gestures, facial expressions, intonations of voice,those quick steps,sharp-eyed glances, and surprise and shock that everything must end, for him apocalyptically.

The rest of the cast is flawless, especially Daisy ( Elizabeth Debicki) and Tobey McGuire. McGuire very subtley suggests the sexual ambiguity that he posseses along with Gatsby's own mysterious attachment to him, never defined, never acknowleged, but there, a sensuality that is absolutely brillaint the way it comes across.

Daisy is at first all shine and glitter and very little substance, but then she suddenly exudes charm and guilesness and purpose. Her ""death"" will be one by 1000 cuts at the hands of her thug of a husband. It is all very well done..one magnificent scene after another.

 Those who are bored with films like this usually go to computer-driven action films about the earth ending or about the iron-clad heros beating up everyone they encounter all done with tricks..but the bad acting! These people who are not into serious cinema cannot be paid attention to in any venue they may choose to criticize a film, for they are finally without a knowlege of the art of film. Leave them to their own devices.

Buy this film and rejoice!",1381104000,,2187,4.7851458885941645

I'd like to say a few things on two elements people criticize: the modern day music, and all the CG. I think having period music wouldn't have given the movie the same kind of craziness. it helps drive across how vain and glitzy the 20s was. As for the CG, I like it for the same reasons. The emotions and activities of these people are so hollow and such, not as real as we would like. I think the loads of CG for everything went along with that. Then there's the beautiful song written by Lana Del Rey that fits perfectly. This is a great movie, with fantastic music, direction, and production design.

Too much 1920's era stuff going on and not enough story. The parties were overdone. I watched it in patches not all at once - only finished watching it because I paid for it! It was painful to watch.

4971586,1,B0067EKYS6,"In the disc's extras, director Baz Luhrmann goes on and on about how much effort went into making everything as authentic as possible, from the set design, hair styles, costumes, the cars, even the cars' sounds. I kept asking myself, why? He sure didn't care that the music and the dancing was as inauthentic as it could be, having absolutely nothing to do with the music of the 20s or the way people danced in the 20s. Why not have a 60"" HDTV hanging on the wall playing music videos?

Why was it so important to Mr. Luhrmann for the sets and costumes to be authentic to the early 20th Century, when the soundtrack and choreography were doing everything possible to take the viewer out of that era, slapping the 21st Century into one's face at every turn?

I felt like I was watching 'Moulin Rouge II'. Don't get me wrong, I loved 'Moulin Rouge'. The modern music worked in that film because it was a musical. A musical, by the sheer fact that people break out in song, is fantasy. But this film is not a musical, making the soundtrack (obviously heard by the characters in the party scenes), and the dancing especially jarring.

When you're dealing with a straight period drama, one based on a classic no less, I want to get lost in the PERIOD. This is impossible when the authenticity is ripped away by modern hip hop and dance music, with the early 20th Century characters doing some lame, stylized, 21st Century Charleston! Not only is it awkward and ugly, but it ruins any emotion that the time period evokes in the viewer.

Please, don't let Mr. Luhrmann set his sights on a remake of 'Gone With the Wind'. God only knows what kind of music Rhett and Scarlett would be dancing to!",1381017600,19,1687,4.485342019543974

4971596,5,B0067EKYS6,"I was aghast when I heard they were making ""The Great Gatsby"" in 3-D.  Was I one of those film snobs who feel the classics should be made by Merchant-Ivory types and relegated to the arthouses?  Truth be told I last read F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel thirty years ago as part of an American Lit class.  Having now seen the film it's nothing short of brilliant.  Baz Luhrmann has breathed life into Fitzgerald's ninety year old work and made it accessible to the masses.  I don't think it was Fitzgerald's intent to only be enjoyed by the elites.  I'm going on recollection and as far as I can tell Luhrmann's version retains most of the original text.  I saw this film in 2-D so I can't really tell what 3-D adds to experiencing this film but it is an eyeful.  The vibrant art direction and costume design signify the excesses and decadence of the Roaring Twenties to a tee.  Despite the spectacle the performances are not overwhelmed by it but draw you into the characters.  This is definitely a film that will resonate for years to come.",1380844800,3,1037,4.497326203208556
4971597,5,B0067EKYS6,"As a fan of the book as well as of DeCaprio's, this is undeniably the Gatsby adaptation I've been waiting for.

First, the set: Much attention is paid to small but important details, such as the glowing green light at the dock and the faded oculist's sign.  The splendor of Gatsby's mansion is recreated exquisitely, and the ""valley of ashes"" doesn't disappoint in its ghastly wasteland.

Second, Luhrmann doesn't depart from the story too much, though I think there was a lot more discourse between Gatsby and Daisy than I remember reading in the book.  He may have changed some of the dialogue, but he does stay unflinchingly true to the spirit of the book and its morals, which I think is vastly more important.

Third, the casting was perfect, and probably the most telling detail about Luhrmann's good judgment in making this film- DeCaprio is the embodiment of Gatsby--the smile, the charm, the mannerisms are all what one reading the book would expect him to be like.  Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway was also a great pick -- he has the 'outsider' qualities required for the role of the narrator.  Debicki as Jordan Baker was also very well-cast; she had the aloof coolness and the slightly-bored gaze I pictured when I read the novel.  Daisy, by far, was the most crucial casting in my opinion, because if played too obnoxiously and over-the-top, the whole story falls flat.  However, Carey Mulligan makes her flighty and airy but also lets her show real emotion.  In a way, though her character does horrible things in the movie, you can't help but feel that she isn't completely devoid of thought/emotion.  And of course, her husband Tom, makes the antagonist as a macho-man whose emotions occasionally seep through to the surface.

Honestly, with all the good things this movie had going for it, the anachronistic music surprisingly didn't bother me one bit.  It was also clever how jazz motifs were mixed in with hip-hop and rap beats, somehow making the sound swirl into an unidentifiable, chaotic experience.

Overall, this was a phenomenal adaptation and definitely a must for any Gatsby fan.",1380844800,126,2106,4.862745098039215

4971632,1,B0067EKYS6,"This is a terrible interpretation of the famous novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. If I could give it zero stars I certainly would. Baz Luhrmann, the director, has remained true to the basic story and plot of the novel, but his selection of actors, the performances they deliver, and the tacky eye-slime that he has provided undermine the entire production.

Because the sets and party scenes have received so much attention, I think it best to point out that they are too slick, too silly, and too shiny. Did every flapper in 1922 dance the Charleston as if they were a professional Broadway dancer? I think not. In the real world bad dancers mix with good dancers on any real world dance floor, but not here. Instead we have perfect dancers acting outrageously while not missing a step in scenes that scream artificiality. Every polished floor or car, every drape or staircase or sofa is overdone. Gatsby wished to achieve what the wealthy had attained as part of his quest for Daisy, so why would he have fallen for such glaringly overdone hotel lobby dcor?

In all fairness, Leonardo DiCaprio does a fair job of playing Gatsby, but unfortunately he is compared to Robert Redford's interpretation which is much more subtle and nuanced. Robert Redford play Gatsby as a tragic character who has pursued an illusion thinking that he has pursued his dream and in the final swimming pool scene the tragedy of expectations unmet is evident. DiCaprio is more surface and less substance in his performance so that in the final swimming pool scene the viewer thinks that another floating pool adornment has popped.

Luhrmann misses the point as to what The Great Gatsby is really all about while he follows the basic story or plot line. He misses the sadness and burden of unrealized dreams.  It is also about classism which Luhrmann never captures. Joel Edgerton does a passable job playing Tom Buchanan, but his performance does not hold a candle to Bruce Dern's excellent performance in an earlier version of Gatsby. The wealthy can use their power for insulation, for insurance against harm, for keeping reality away, and most importantly, for getting their way. Dern captures this aspect of wealthy in a way that Edgerton misses.

Tobey Maguire is an awkward Nick Carraway and his performance is almost silly in comparison to the more natural performance of Sam Waterston in an earlier version of Gatsby. Maquire plays Carraway as a wide-eyed intrusive, almost adolescent, intrusive observer whereas Waterston plays Carraway with more intelligence, natural grace, more worldly reflection and experience. Maguire plays Carraway like a newly hatched chicken, staring at the drama around him, never relaxing, never fitting in with any social ease. Waterston plays a young man but he has the background and intelligence to put the drama that is unfolding before his eyes in perspective. Isla Fisher does a passing job playing Myrtle Wilson but her performance does not compare to the outstanding job done by Karen Black in the previous version. Black dripped desire and vulnerability whereas Fisher was over dressed and doll-like, a piece on a chess board and not a real person in a real tragedy. But the worst performance of all would have to be Carey Mulligan playing Daisy Buchanan. Mulligan is unfortunately compared to Mia Farrow and comes up very short. Mulligan never captures the real vulnerability, the underlying fear, the neurosis just under the surface that Farrow captures in Daisy. Daisy is a crushable flower, she is not strong, she make poor choices, she wants to be directed and told what to do and Farrow captures this essence whereas Mulligan plays Daisy as a pretty ordinary girl who happens to be rich, happens to have selected the wrong husband, and now is in a fix as she falls for her old boyfriend.

F. Scott Fitzgerald lived in a world of struggle, hardship, and competition before he was introduced to the world of fame, glamour, and wealth. He knew that the rich play by different rules, they win, they take it all, they leave nothing, they are cunning, they use you up and throw you away. Tom Buchanan is the personification of this process yet it underlies the personal tragedy of the story. Poor people die and rich people go on cruises. Fitzgerald has this as a structural theme in his novel but Luhrmann completely misses this point.

Are Redford, Farrow, Dern, Black and Waterston that much more accomplished as actors than DiCaprio, Mulligan, Edgerton, Maguire, and Fisher? Maybe so but the fault in this failed interpretation lies at the feet of an insensitive director, Luhrmann.",1380672000,11,4606,4.927835051546392

1st the positives. It looks good, the party scenes and the set design are every bit as audacious as you'd expect from a work that lampooned the gross excessiveness of the roaring 20s.
2nd The acting is pretty good and they had the right cast

Now the bad
1) I cant stand an historical piece that uses modern music. WHY IS JAY-Z on the soundtrack and why do I hear his annoying hip hop rhymes throughout the movie? It just takes you out the story completely. The 1920s had a soundtrack and hip hop and rap was not part of it. And for that matter neither was techno music which is also featured throughout the movie and during the party scenes. You wouldn't make a civil war movie and have Britney Spears singing Opps I Did it Again during one of the battle scenes, then why have Jay-Z playing when they walk into a speakeasy
2) They miss a lot of the character story and the symbolic meaning of the book as embodied in the characters. What they did to Daisey is a shame, she isn't just a person she represents something each person is metaphor and when you change how certain characters acted and reacted to the storyline then you lose the metaphor they were supposed to represent

In short, this movie was a butchering of a classic. A very stylized butchering but it butchers the work that F Scott Fitzgerald created, but it does use a pearl handled hatchet",1380585600,4,1468,4.413284132841328

Instead, this is the most matured, assured and well-made film by Baz Lurhmann to date.
The key to the success of any film adaptations of this classic is the casting.
Leonardo di Caprio gave an astonishingly good performance as the elusive, vulnerable and love-crazed Gatsby.
Carey Mulligan while not a true beauty in a sense but as Daisy she was able to project an emotionally fragile and shallow woman.
Joel Edgerton made Tom Buchanan an unsympathetic character totally believable and made the viewers appreciate his shrew motives.
Lastly, Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as the wide-eyed and kind-hearted Nick Carraway.
Credits must be given to Baz Lurhmann to keep this film adaptation under lid while concentrating on telling the story of that unfulfilled love.

Some people may be put off by the contemporary/hip-hop music that plays during the dance numbers, but it gave me a sense of actually being there and added to the excitement for me. There are a couple of instances where Tobey Maguire seems to break character for a second, going into a smile during a serious scene, but overall stellar acting.

So, by that standard, this lives up to expectations.  It has the grandness, the glitter, the music, the costumes.  Visually, it's a stunning movie.  Possibly that's why this movie fails in some respects.  The actors simply can't live up to the grand scale of the rest of the movie.  Dicaprio does make a fine Gatsby.  He gets the desperation and the ruthlessness perfectly.  And his good looks, while not a match for Redford, make him all the more irresistible.  Carey Mulligan looks the part of Daisy but can't quite pull off the careless little rich girl.  For one thing, she seems much too young and she doesn't have the hardness that Daisy must ultimately possess.  And, honestly, there just didn't seem to be any chemistry between the two stars.  The attraction seemed more superficial than obsessive and overpowering.  The biggest miss, character wise, was Tobey Maquire as Nick Carraway.  It just felt like he was reading someone else's story rather than telling his own.  The beginning of the movie felt completely awkward with his character, almost embarrassingly so.  From the time that Gatsby and Daisy meet, the movie does improve and rolls along pretty well for a while.

4971671,4,B0067EKYS6,"""Gatsby"" is a movie about would-be writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) as he leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan  (Joel Edgerton). It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits.

Gatsby is based on the classic American novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  I remember this being required reading in high school back in the day as an example of a great novel.  Although I didn't really appreciate the novel for what it was back then, I realize now that this was a great telling of the times in the 20's.

The director does a good job at recreating the era of the 1920s, but also gives it a modern edge and a flair that could only be captured in the world of film.  Some people are critizing the modern music choices in the film as opposed to the music of the era, but that didn't bother me and I thought gave it a good backdrop for the excesses of the time that reflect some of the excesses of the modern era.

Gatsby is beautifully made and shows the glitz and glam of the era.

Leonardo DiCaprio does a good job with the character and I feel at times doesn't get enough credit for playing character roles.  In fact, all the main characters do admirable jobs in bringing their characters to life.

The 2013 Gatsby is not the 1925 version of the Great Gatsby, and it simply can't be but that doesn't necessarily a bad thing.

I think the producer owed them money and instead put their music as ""paid in full"". The music totally bastardized the era. I'm appalled at Leonardo's decision to star in this monstrosity, which makes me think that he had a mortgage payment due and needed the money. Don't get me wrong: his acting shines on the screen and you're kinda left longing to see more of him, than the voyeur Toby Macguire. What was his function again? The woman playing Daisy--I was so not impressed with her performance. She was lackluster.

4971689,3,B0067EKYS6,"This wasn't a bad film, but it had several flaws...the overuse of ""green screen"" being one of them. The costumes and set were quite dazzling and beautiful, but it was so obvious that there was a green screen behind the actors in several of the scenes; I found it fairly distracting. However, the party scenes at Gatsby's house were especially well-done, and the viewer could really experience the hedonism going on there! (It's probably worth watching the movie just for those scenes). Leonardo does a very nice job as Jay Gatsby, and I felt he was faithful to the character portrayed in the novel by Fitzgerald. Carrie Mulligan did a stellar job as well with the pivotal character of Daisy. Yet, one of the aspects of the film that annoyed me the most was the music. I am a purist and would like to have heard authentic 1920's era music, instead of modern rap music! (I thought it was ridiculous in this film). Overall, I do feel that this movie is worth watching if you can get past some glaring flaws.",1380240000,5,1004,4.552486187845304

The result is a frantic mess, and I agree with the critics who said it was sound and fury, signifying nothing.  First, Toby McGuire is dreadful in this part (and often in other roles), and so my ears felt assaulted by his callow whine every time he spoke or narrated.  The much-ballyhooed opulence of the film feels like second-hand Moulin Rouge run through a blender, a slumgullion of ""techniques"" that don't tell an even mildly interesting story.  And the framing narrative is so badly done at first I hoped it almost classifies as camp. You know how bad it is the *third* time confetti starts falling during the lavish party scene.  Doesn't matter that it's differently shaped. And relying on fireworks? Tacky.  It's not surprising TGG did better abroad; so do the big, showy, dumb movies made from comics.",1380240000,9,983,4.7251461988304095

4971697,4,B0067EKYS6,"I read the book some time ago and then saw this in theaters.  I was re-watching it bored one night.  Is it worth a watch?  I'd say yes, but only if you know what you're getting into.  If you're just looking for an entertaining movie to watch and know little about the story, it might be a bit long (perceived as boring).  If you've read The Great Gatsby you should watch.  Purists are probably upset as this is an art-deco retooling of the movie.  As such everything is over-the-top.

The good:
- It follows the book pretty closely without much alteration.
- The imagery is beautiful.
- The lighting in the movie is fantastic.
- It's The Great Gatsby!

The bad:
- Leo might have added a touch too much to Jay.  The character is already over the top, but Leo makes him a bit tooooo crazy in my opinion.
- The Great Gatsby should be about emotion.  The overacting from nearly everyone in the movie pushed it beyond a simple emotional story, into a jazzy show-tune.  That's where the disconnect occurs and everyone thinks it's boring, because it's not believable.  You can't feel the emotion of Daisy and Jay.
- They gloss over some of the past history from the book.  Those scenes feel about 5 seconds long...but they're important to the character development.

The ugly:
- Jay-Z?  Seriously?  The music choices in this movie are awful.
- The ending feels rushed while the middle of the movie falls flat.  Hard to connect to over acted characters.
- Wolfsheim...another poor casting job.  I went in expecting Arnold Rothstein and came out feeling like he was dirty poor pimp rather than the man that fixed the world series.

Conclusion:

I OWN TWO DIFFERENT PANASONIC 3-D BLU-RAY PLAYERS DMP-BT220 AND DMP-BT-310. THE 3-D COPY PLAYED FINE AS WELL AS THE REGULAR DVD COPY,BUT THE 2-D BLUE RAY DISC WOULD NOT PLAY IN EITHER PLAYER.

It is a flashy, noisy, yet terminally dull film.  The acting is wooden, the dialogue stilted.  Good actors are used as mannequins and props so Baz can photograph his lavish sets (even though most everything is done with a very noticeable CGI backdrop).  Everything is so stylized that it doesn't really draw one into the concept of excess and its pitfalls as a theme, it is just simply excess on display.  It all serves to make this interpretation of The Great Gatsby about as poignant and meaningful as a P Diddy video.  Avoid this and buy the novel.",1379203200,2,680,4.578512396694215

He may see a scene in a movie and wonder if he could ever be attracted to a man. Well, after seeing about 30 minutes of The Great Gatsby, I knew for certain I am 100% straight, because this is the queerest picture ever made. In the worst way possible. This is the movie that proves that for every ultra-talented gay person, there's Baz Luhrmann's toilet taste, an aesthetic made for $2 tranny shows. There is nothing at all about this film that strikes the right note - it's revolting throughout in every possible way. The casting is absurd, the script pretentious and stupid, and the direction, well, let's create a category called Cowpie.

4971824,5,B0067EKYS6,"It is so refreshing when a film lives up to your expectations. I have been a fan of Fitzgerald's masterpiece for many, many years. Happily, I was very impressed with this version. I don't think it could have been better filmed or casted. The soundtrack -- a bit controversial to some who don't understand the director's artistry -- was perfect in expressing the spirit of each given scene.  (People forget that jazz was the hip-hip/rap of its day. The older generations in the 20's denounced it as ""Devil's music."" Also, this movie speaks to the younger audiences today. The contemporary soundtrack is successful at making viewers long to be a part of the lavish, wild parties thrown by Gatsby, and greatly add to his allure.) People who take this story only at face value are missing the larger picture. This book/film is a (rather cynical) commentary on the elusiveness of the American Dream -- something that countless Jay Gatsbys have striven for, only to become faceless victims of its sharp (but hidden) teeth.

The spirit of this story is perfectly understood by its actors (or so it appears.) DiCaprio, because he is so attractive physically, is often underrated as an actor. He nailed Jay Gatsby. As far as I was concerned, he WAS Jay Gatsby. He managed to convey the perfect balance of Gatsby's grand mystique and devastating vulnerability.

This is a film I feel I must own. Rarely do I come to that conclusion about any new film.",1379116800,2,1441,4.779116465863454
4971825,4,B0067EKYS6,"Although the only other version I have only seen is the 1974 version (pretty boring) I'm sure this is the most exciting interpretation of the story. This is pretty much everything you would expect from flamboyant director Baz Lurhmann with the added influence of producer Shawn Carter (Jay-Z).

It is obvious Jay wanted his fingerprints to be clearly visible on this film as many of his songs are noticeably played throughout. This is probably the movies most controversial point as it is a period piece, though if you know and like the way Baz Lurhmann's movies are, this is probably something you have already come to expect. The atmosphere of the movie is like that of a party you've always wanted to go to but never been invited. Visually it's stunning in almost every single shot (largely due to green screen and other digital effects).

While the plot is not new, the way it was written this time made it far more interesting from a storytelling aspect. Lurhmann has a fantastic tendency to romantisize any personal encounters, this works quite well for this film particularly.",1379116800,,1083,4.848648648648648

There were many fine things about it as the film technique and design work really evoked the period for me.  However, I found it slow and plodding in places and that made it difficult to stay interested and engaged in the movie.  I also couldn't help feeling the lead role was miscast.  In short, what i was up for seeing turned out to be a snooze-fest for me.

From the visually sumptuous opening credits to the final sad scenes, I enjoyed every minute. True, I might not have made some of the casting choices, but the actors are all effective; and it took about 20 minutes to get fully into the action, as is typical of a Baz Luhrmann movie; but the costumes and scenery and acting all combined to make a beautiful film that underscored the pathos of this famous character study. Is Gatsby the ultimate optimist, as the narrator believes, or are all the characters complete fools? The question is one decided by each viewer, and opens some stimulating conversations. My only real criticism of this version is of it being in 3D. Why? Such a distraction! Other than that, it's a feast for the eyes and the intellect.",1379116800,2,878,4.670967741935484

After much research and many calls to Panasonic, it was discovered that there is not enough memory in the unit to handle all the menu items and such (thanks Baz for so much info!).  However, the easy fix is to insert a blank SD card of 2GB or larger into the SD slot to the right of the disk tray in the front.  This adds the extra memory it needs to play the blu-ray.  I found the Ultra versions (10x) work best.

Since this looks like an ongoing issue, I would recommend Amazon stock because many people, myself included, will be buying SD cards for their Panasonic players. <grin>

Meanwhile, the movie is lush and worth the watch. Still working through all of the special features Baz has on the disk.

When it comes down to it, this retelling of ""The Great Gatsby"", will most likely be a hit (for all the wrong reasons).

I'm an opinionated old coot (born in 1955), who grew up listening to old movies, old music and reading old books.  I love Jazz, adore Gershwin, and other music from the 20's.  So I guess I've always been a little off key and out of step with so called popular entertainment.  That said, trash is trash regardless of when or how it's created.  Luhrmann's lurid retelling of ""The Great Gatsby"" fails miserably on so many levels it reduced me to tears.

The soundtrack and music are jarringly uncomfortable and not even remotely close to the type of music popular during the 20s, let alone described within the pages of Fitzgerald's Gatsby.  It's almost as if Luhrmann believes Jazz is too archaic for modern (translation: younger) viewers to enjoy let alone comprehend.

Technically stunning, with astonishing attention to detail, I'm saddened beyond words for what this movie could have been.  Gorgeous visual elements created by combining  20s achiaval film and graphics along with state of the art CGI and newly created film ::: all thrown together in a never ending frenetic 3D display.  Exhausting to watch, confusing to follow and boring in ways difficult to describe.  Simply too much excess, too much noise, too much bad behavior, too much vulgarity and too much of everything else.

The visual effects out shine almost everything real in this movie.  The movie is filled with so much visual imagry, movement, music and noise as to obscure the actors.  For me, much of the movie's substance was lost in the cacophony.  In a way I felt as if I were watching a movie that had been filmed from a speeding car ::: everything's a bright vivid confusing and noisy blur.

I found Luhrmann's schizophrenogenic version of ""The Great Gatsby"" difficult to watch and oddly depressing for ALL the wrong reasons.  But don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and then decide.

The Cast

Jay Gatsby: Leonardo DiCaprio shines as Gatsby.  I would have loved to see him act in a less manic movie.

Nick Carraway: Tobey Maguire (an actor I admire greatly) comes across like a wide eyed nebbish totally out of his depth.  But then that could be how Luhrmann wanted him to act.

Tom Buchanan: Joel Edgerton comes across as boorish, vulgar and lascivious in the extreme.  His considerable talents were wasted on this film.

Daisy Buchanan: Carey Mulligan's performance is more a caricature of Daisy, than a living incarnation.  Mulligan's performances in other movies have been stunningly real, and a joy to watch.

Myrtle Wilson: Isla Fisher, another actor who's talents are wasted in this horrid film.",1378944000,,2871,4.788187372708758

4971898,5,B0067EKYS6,"I am starting to believe DiCaprio is the best actor alive,..this movie confirms what I thought after watching him in Romeo and Juliet a few years back,..he's an artist, rare in recipe weary Hollywood,  not just a Grecian urn of a gorgeous face, frozen in neurotic preciosity, like Ben Affleck or Harrison Ford, he is truly unique and impossible to categorize. I say, appreciate him while he's in our midst,..or, as Jesus famously told Judas ""you'll be sorry when I'm gone"", yeah, that's in the Babo, only you never actually read those fairy tales to which you entrust your eternal soul, so you think, like Sir Yorick, I'm jesting. OK, sorry if I perturbed the dwindlings that still believe in talking snakes, but, seriously:
  There is a beautiful moment near the beginning, if you love the book you will know this part: ""He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself..."" In this scene the camera zooms in and I swear DiCaprio was Gatsby in that moment, the way I envisioned him ever since I first read the book in high school english. I was crying like a newborn baby, I couldn't believe anyone else, besides me,...""understood"" what a wonderful, momentous event in 'psychological' literary history had taken place, Freud and Dostoevsky notwithstanding.  Ok, hyperbolic me, you're thinking. (that sounds like a great song title, eh? YOU have my permission to use it)
I recommend: if this movie you like, read the Last Tycoon by the same author, and RUN, don't walk, to rent DiCaprio's Romeo and Juliet.
Pros: excellent casting! sumptuous sets, tons of creativity in music and mood, and through it all they stayed true to the book--which is a new pair-of-dimes, or as you pedants would say, ""paradigm"", the meaning of which has eluded me since that day all the windows blew out in my philosophy101 class at UNLV due to the Pepcon Blast.
Cons: if you have a sub-average IQ (read o.b.a.m.a.p.h.o.n.e) you won't 'get' the movie or the book. This is not a put-down, I just want to save you time and money so you can,..say,...enjoy a 10 dollar Vegas buffet, replete with wine and hints of sexual encounters that your loyal family, back in California, will never find out about. After all, you are their hero, come to Vegas on an important Convention, because you are a serious man, with a suit and tie, and self-improvement books in your briefcase, a real life Dick Diver, only on the south-bound train.",1378684800,,2804,4.775257731958763

4971901,4,B0067EKYS6,"The 2013 movie adaptation of The Great Gatsby scores four gold stars for contemporary music, touching acting, and a surprise ending. In the story, we learn about the glamorous lives of New York City's Long Islanders from newcomer Nick Carraway, played by Tobey Maguire. Nick narrates an epic love affair between his cousin Daisy Buchannan, played by Carey Mulligan, and millionaire Jay Gatsby, Leonardo DiCaprio. The story of The Great Gatsby is original and heartwarming. With characters motivated by love, jealousy, and curiosity, the viewer gets swept up in the strong driving emotions of the story.

At the beginning of the movie, Nick moves in next to the mysterious Gatsby mansion. Every weekend, Gatsby throws outlandish parties complete with endless alcohol, energetic dancing, and six-foot-tall champagne bottles that spray confetti into the crowd. Everyone is invited, and the whole of New York City piles into convertibles for the drive out to the island. Curious, Nick joins the merriment one night by a formal invitation from Gatsby himself. He learns that Gatsby and Daisy used to be in love five years before. However, Gatsby was sent to war, and Daisy married another man. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange tea for the old lovers to catch up. As Gatsby and Daisy rekindle their romance, the viewer learns that Daisy's husband Tom is also having an affair.

By far, the best part of the movie is the couple's reunion. Gatsby brings scores of gaudy bouquets of flowers and two cakes popping with bright pinks and blues, squeezing them into Nick's quaint living room. When Daisy arrives, Gatsby gets so nervous that he runs out into the rain, changing his mind about seeing Daisy again. A few minutes later, he returns, bashful and soaking wet. The two talk for hours.

Although the reunion is the best scene, the viewer is entertained throughout the movie by the 1920s women's flapper costumes and sharp men's suits that are showcased as the highlight of the movie. The updated Jay-Z rap songs and Lana Del Ray ballads contemporize an older story and engage a younger audience with an older story.

For all of the movie's accomplishments, the story plods along like an old horse at the beginning. Before Gatsby and Daisy reunite, the viewer isn't quite sure what the point of the story is. The purpose of the movie could be made clearer at the beginning with a flash forward or some foreshadowing. Daisy's character acts selfishly for the entirety of the film, and the viewer ends up disliking her as a result.  If she poured out more of her thoughts and feelings, the viewer could understand her motivations better.

The Great Gatsby is reminiscent of Moulin Rouge (2001) and Marie Antoinette (2006) because all three movies are untraditional love stories where emotions run high and the endings are unexpected. They all are set in historically great cities: New York City, Paris, and Versailles. And in each film, contemporary music is paired with an older story. Anyone who enjoyed one of the three will enjoy the others.

The Great Gatsby is a story about crazy love, crazy parties, and crazy people. The drama draws in the viewers, and the strong emotions hold them until the end. The viewer pities Gatsby for losing Daisy to her husband, and the ending only drives home that immense sympathy. Gatsby is the underdog, and so we hope he will get the love of his life.",1378684800,,3379,4.886561954624782
4971902,2,B0067EKYS6,"I couldn't wait to get this DVD as the actual movie only ran in my local theater for 2 weeks.  While Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors, and I would see ANY movie he starred in... this was a colossal disappointment.  While there were moments in the movie where true DiCaprio charm showed, the script and actual story just wasn't for him.  This was the first movie I saw with Tobey McGuire... and hopefully the last.  The guy just can't act.  His words were like he was just reading the script, no emotion, no facial expression.  Maybe that's what his character was supposed to be.  He just seemed so very out of place in this glitzy movie.  The final word I have is that the soundtrack could have been SO MUCH BETTER without the rap music!  I kind of expected old Hollywood, roaring 20's kind of music and the wrap was just way off base.  Most of the other non-rap songs were good and fit the scenes quite well, but I cannot get past all the unnecessary rap.  Sorry, this director was just off base and the movie could have been so much better.",1378684800,,1056,4.336734693877551

4971906,3,B0067EKYS6,"......and always has been, rather lackluster.

I have, oddly, yet to meet anyone who read and liked the book.

Friends and family of mine, have spoken about this movie in conjunction with the disappointment they felt after having to read it for English Class in H.S.

Back in the day, for many of us stuck reading THE GREAT GATSBY by school requirement, we all wondered how F Scott Fitzgerald could  write a book with such a simple plot and one that contained no real moral to it, or at least some striking revelation about people/life, and still manage to win this very ordinary book much hype and acclaim.

If he had written this book today, I think he would not have been published.

There really is nothing outstanding about the story.

In any case, for some reason, his book stood out to those who read it, and he got published.

Eventually the book took off like wildfire.

BACK TO THE MOVIE:  Dicaprio, who I do like a lot as an actor, is miscast here, in my humble opinion.

I kept waiting for him to comfortably slip into character, but something is amiss and I kept seeing Leonardo Dicaprio dressed up in  Roaring 20's attire and not some figure named Jay Gatsby.

 His constant use of the phrasing,"" Old Chap"" is beyond annoying and seems unbelievable, coming from his mouth.

Tobey Maguire ends up really being the best and most interesting character in the movie.

I also feel he stole the movie from everyone as Nick Carraway- the one who narrates the story in the book.

  The spotlight shines on the incredible wealth of the times and people depicted here, and it glows specifically on this particular place on the coast of the Long Island Sound.

While given a bogus name in the story, Fitzgerald was referring in general, to the location of Nassau County's North Shore of Long Island- which is still deemed THE GOLD COAST even today, as it does have many breathtaking old mansions that still exist.

The cinematography is fantastic and I felt it was worth renting it just to see how this movie was filmed.

The music is current music- which throws the film off kilter a bit.

 Why this artistic license was taken, I am unsure.

You see the art deco decor and the timely fashions of the 20's, but throwing in modern music left me- and others- a bit puzzled.

 But, I will say, that when you see the party scenes and hear today's music, the director definitely managed to pull it off.  This might have been done to appeal to the younger generation of viewers.

I am sure some of the  older segment of viewers will think the director should have stayed with a truer approach to that  era's music.

There are some minor additions to the story-mainly the beginning and ending, that were not in the book. However, they do not affect the integrity of the original story.

All the actors did a great job with the role they were given, but Dicaprio just can't seem to pull off the role of a mature, mystery man of money.
It is not that he wasn't trying. I just don't think this role was meant for him.

With now 3 versions of THE GREAT GATSBY on film( ALAN LADD- ROBERT REDFORD & NOW LEONARDO DICAPRIO), I don't think we will see another version anytime soon.

I saw the coming attractions for this movie and I thought maybe, with a great all star cast and the very enticing visuals, it might- MIGHT- change my mind about the book.

Unfortunately, no.

 Even awesome cinematography cannot save a basic story.

This movies definitely pads it out with looks, but in the end you are still left with the book you read in High School.

I will say, when it comes to the first opening scene of a party in progress, you are wonderfully bombarded by incredible imagery- and you DO soak it all in!

VISUALLY GORGEOUS IS WHAT THE MOVIE IS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT SAVES IT FROM BEING A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.",1378684800,,3802,4.491970802919708
4971907,5,B0067EKYS6,I think everyone did a great job in this movie! From the acting to the costumes everything made the story told a great movie! This movie is a must see for 2013!,1378684800,,160,4.03125
4971908,5,B0067EKYS6,"What a movie, what acting, what direction, what a story of Love everlasting is F. Scott Fitzgerald's Novel and Movies in the first one with Alan Ladd, the second one with Robert Redford and the third one with Leonardo Dicaprio all as The Great Gatsby.

The Love forgotten by a woman, who was to wealthy to lower herself to the level of a poor man.  How sad that things have not changed even in today's world.  We live for power climbing to the top of society and for what?  To be unhappy in a marriage of no true love, but a duty to their wealthy parents, and ancestors.  While the man cheats with other women, while is model wife does her duties to put on a show for the rest of society, as the perfect wife and mother.

This is a must have movie to add to my collection of great movies.  I now will have all three by the end of this month and worth every penny each and everyone of them.

Leonardo Dicaprio was and is a perfect Gatsby and as an actor is a young Orsen Wells, as actors go and beyond anyone's expectations he will accomplish much, as he is very careful what he chooses to act in, and does a superior job in each and everyone of the movies I have ever seen him in.  Tobey Maguire as Nick Carraway, also chooses his roles carefully and will go far, as he has in so many movies I have, also seen him in, was perfect for the rold of Nick Carraway the cousin of Daisy Buchanan played by Carey Mulligan was almost as good as Mia Farrow in the second movie of The Great Gatsby.

4971911,5,B0067EKYS6,"Normally, I find myself disappointed after viewing film adaptations for novels I've already read, because I feel like they hinder the original images & emotions that I drew from my own reading experience. However, I can't wait to read Fitzgerald's classic novel again after watching this, with a new-found appreciation for a story with such depth & beauty, yet tragedy all at once.

 This is not only an excellent portrayal of an American classic, but they did a spectacular job of incorporating modern music into a story that takes place decades ago. I would never have thought that songs by Jay-Z or will.i.am could fit into a 1920's setting, but the songs were tastefully placed in a way that I personally felt added to the film, rather than detracting from it.

4971913,1,B0067EKYS6,"The movie is basically ruined by a music soundtrack that is completely alien to the story. The story has as an essential back drop the wild jazz age of the late 1920's the music breaks that feeling that the story is so focused on.
The story itself is only loosely based on the original book. I wouldn't watch the movie as a way of getting away from reading the book for a class. Still it would have been an okay movie, if it wasn't for the music.
The music kills the movie for me. Please don't get me wrong, I love pop music as much as anyone else, and have a few rap albums in my collection, the music just does not fit the 1920's story.",1378598400,26,638,4.071428571428571

This movie is all about plagarazing the other version scene for scene,so I can see why they hired Jay Z. Watch that one it's 1000x better. As the NYTimes said, the book literally spells out the soundtrack so it should have been very easy for the director. Baz Lurhman is not ""love it"" or ""hate it""; he just sucks. This is what you call a ""feelie"" to take a phrase from Brave New World- it's all schlock and no substance. It's like a giant commercial made for five year olds or maybe raccoons who only require that their films showcase a lot of shiny objects. I don't see the chemistry between the love interests at all.

4971925,1,B0067EKYS6,"This is a fair movie... if you can manage to sit through the first half.  The first hour of this film made me want to scratch my eyes out, it makes no sense, has no consistency, is historically inaccurate to the point of bringing tears my eyes and is just abolutely retardedly ridiculous.  Poorly made is an understatement, this film will stand for all time as a testament to the fact that a big budget, big stars and outrageous CG effects do not mean the movie is good.

Other than the fact that the first half of the movie (unlike the book) made absolutely no sense, seemed to completely lack any purpose and was nearly sickening in it's constant camera-angle changing motion spinning toward making as much noise and pretty colors as possible without advancing any kind of plot... it was freaking BORING and completely uninteresting.  The only reason I even made it through more than 30 minutes of this tripe is because my wife refuses to not watch a movie she's paid for, no matter how awful.

Now, at about half-way through the film, after this absolutely ridiculous excuse for a ""party"" at Gatsby's (see below), the film slowly becomes tolerable.  As if they suddenly changed directors the film starts to turn away form flashy, noisy ""look at how cool looking my new movie is"" (which it isn't) toward an actual character and circumstance driven story.  Too late though, because by the time it really gets interesting it's pretty much over, and to be honest I was more than ready for it to be.

Why it sucks more than anything else:  Historical piece, base upon classic literature, with absolutely NO historical accuracy or base of reference.  Dear director and producer, this is supposed to be the roaring twenties you idiots, do some research.  JAZZ MUSIC DOES NOT SOUND AT ALL LIKE CLUB MUSIC, people didn't dress like that, the world didn't look like that, they didn't have super-charged cars that could outrun the batmobile, they didn't talk like that, and nothing was made of plastic.  Ever heard of this thing called art nouveau?  No?  Well they did in the twenties.  Truly, the opportunity this movie had to protray life in the twenties should have been inspirational.  Instead, the production team used it as an opportunity to go retarded.  SHAME ON THIS MOVIE AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN MAKING IT.

4971930,2,B0067EKYS6,"Frenetic energy gushed everywhere in this film, creating such a motion sickness that I'm surprised they didn't supply barf bags to the people in the audience. And sadly, some of the imagery was indeed clever and could have worked if it had been used sparingly and as a thematic spice, but instead it drenched the film in a stylized vomit that obscured the entire point of the story. In short, the signal to noise ratio in the movie may make your head explode. Although Luhrmann presents a fair amount of the story from the novel, it's like reading the Cliff Notes version. The characters act out famous scenes, recite memorable lines, but in the end it's all devoid of meaning.

I was at least expecting the visuals to exceed the original, but it just came off as harsh. No subtlety or beauty. It was a total trash effort of a classic book and the original film.

The only member of the new cast I did like was Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan. Tobey McGuire was acceptable as Nick Carroway. Mr. DiCaprio is not a bad actor, again miscast as Gatsby.

I am a complete sucker for a romantic plot, especially those with a ""Cinderella"" undertone such as this one.

The constant use of Jay Z, Kanye West, and Beyonce music throughout the film completely ruined the entire thing for me. At almost every chance the movie makers had to draw us into the scene and try to give us an understanding of the mood of the era, instead of giving us authentic music of the day, they gave us modern hip hop and pop songs that destroyed any realism created by the amazing sets and wardrobe.

You could put the party scenes next to those in Moulin Rouge and hardly be able to tell them apart - the same sort of over-the-top glitz and wild, modern music and crazy costumes.

4972000,5,B0067EKYS6,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Baz Luhrmann is an absolute genius.

I saw the movie just hours after finishing the book, and I will say that it is honestly an acceptable replacement for the book. I do not think there was anything that Fitzgerald wanted readers to get out of the book that was not portrayed in the movie. That is not to say that you shouldn't read the book, but if you don't, you will not be missing anything important.

The cast was perfect. They simply could not have done any better, and neither could anyone else have. Especially Carrey Mulligan, as Daisy. Her and DiCaprio BOTH deserve TWO Oscars, and possibly a few dozen gourmet cakes, for their performances.

Luhrmann's trademark visual decadence was perfect for this story. I honestly don't think that the surrealistic luxury of Gatsby's parties could have been adequately achieved in the past, without the aid of 21st century picture enhancement and special effects capabilities, and I don't think anyone else could use those capabilities as masterfully and tastefully as Luhrmann does.

I've heard many negative comments about the modern music, but I think that it was a brilliant decision, and that F Scott Fitzgerald would have agreed with it wholeheartedly. It helped US to connect to the story more. Using music that WE hear at big parties, rather than appealing to us with nostalgia by using 1920's Jazz music.

And with that, I will now proceed to buy this perfect movie.",1378339200,,1473,4.783464566929134

But I admit, those kind of reviews always influence me, until I see the movie.  9 times out of 10  I never agree with the reviews.  This movie was directed by the great Baz Luhrman.  Leonardo DiCaprio was a revelation as Gatsby.  I found it so moving and his performance elicited many tears for me personally. The music, which is highly controversial--and I was prepared to hate--was marvelous.  I  do not know if people are uptight about monkeying with a classic or what it is, but how can anybody not like that music?  I watched it in 3D and it was breathtaking.

Leonardo DiCaprio was excellent as Gatsby, and i can't think of a single character who was poorly cast (Joseph Gordon Levitt would have made an excellent Nick, but then again I'm biased-i much prefer him as an actor over Tobey Maguire).

I loved Leo Dicaprio as Gatsby and Joel Edgarton as Buchanon, and everyone else is strong too (these were just the two standouts for me.) I didn't love all of the artistic choices Luhrman made - I felt the contemporary music didn't always work - but I was mostly enthralled, and the choices engendered discussion between my husband and I.

I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.

The Great Gatsby - We own the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD + UltraViolet Combo Pack

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
Nick Carraway, a somewhat reserved bond salesman in the rip-roaring 20's has an appointment with destiny when he accepts the invite of his `married to a blue blood' cousin, Daisy Buchanan and her husband (and Nick's college friend) Tom.  After Tom introduces Nick to his mistress (a strumpet and gas station owner's wife) and a multitude of slumming it friends, Nick begins to spiral into the decadent life which culminates in an invite from his next door neighbor - the very mysterious Jay Gatsby.  Very long story short (in a Bowling for Movies lightning round) Gatsby = new money; Buchanan = old money; Daisy = married for the money; Nick = go-between for Gatsby and Daisy (who apparently fell in love prior to the War to End All Wars but she couldn't wait for him); Mysterious Letter = Still Mysterious - and I watched the whole film.  Much drama and tragedy ensues.  Note to self: no swimming at Gatsby's house.

You ever see an ad for some really good food... you couldn't help it, the T.G.I.Friday's rib platter just looked so good on the T.V.  You find yourself thinking about those delicious looking ribs all day until you finally just can't contain yourself any longer and you head on down to the nearest strip mall, pull in, and nearly run to the door - your mouth salivating painfully.  You sit down, it's noisy in here... real noisy but hey, those ribs will make it all worthwhile.  You exchange loud words with the waitress who can't seem to get your order straight (because she can't hear you any better than you can hear her) and you hope for the best.  Hey, at least you ordered the cheesy sticks appetizers, you know, to get the evening headed in the right direction.  While you wait (they still haven't brought the drinks yet) you realize two things at the same time... the sun is shining RIGHT IN YOUR eye off a Ford Taurus in the parking lot and you've stuck your pant leg to a wad of gum someone ""thoughtfully"" left under the table.  You look at your watch as you watch the sun move down the sky and 20, 30, 40 minutes go by... still no cheesy sticks, but hey, at least you got your Coke (but what is that aftertaste???  Did they give you a Diet Coke?)  Your waitress seems to have an uncanny ability to NEVER look your way every time she walks by and even your, ""Excuse me, Miss??!!??"" was ignored but it's so loud in here she probably couldn't have heard you even if you were right next to her.  40 minutes turns into an hour and you look at the `fun and wacky' farm implements, kitchen tools, old pictures, and other visual candy they have tacked up on the wall one more time... maybe you missed some interesting tidbit between the old license plates and the picture of dogs playing poker.... Nope, guess not.  Finally the waitress flies by and drops a plate of disappointment in front of you - still no cheesy sticks - and you get a good look at your dinner.  Are those ribs?  Why is the sauce that off color orange and dried on the plate.  The fries are soggy and instead of cooked to a golden brown remind you more of a jaundice victim.  A McRib sandwich at McDonald's tastes better but at least you paid a premium to get it.  Yup, that's what watching The Great Gatsby was like this afternoon.

Ok, let me be honest - I couldn't tell if I liked the movie or not after we watched this and neither could Mrs. Movie Dude or Little Miss Movie Dude.  Visually striking but cartoonish... musically extravagant and Hip Hop sore thumb... story about hope that had none... it was a movie of paradoxes.  Stylistically it was 100% Baz Lurrmann but in a very pedestrian, been there done that way - nearly feels like Moulin Rouge rebooted.  Admittedly, we are not really big on tragic stories but even still... this one just felt like it was missing something.  It left us feeling like microwaved and set under a heat lamp rib platter at T.G.I. Friday's.

What I loved:
* The costumes and other period visuals were decadent... rich silks, art-deco everything, sumptuous over the top parties... everything was beautiful to behold.
* This movie was cast fantastically - Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton and Elizabeth Debicki were clearly the right team to bring the story to the screen - better direction and story development would have brought out their talent more vibrantly
* The third dimension - wowza, the 3D was wonderfully rendered; no ghosting or double images and also very artfully used - we are not the ""needs to poke me in the eye to be called good 3D"" people but rather we look for 3D to help draw us into the story, GREAT 3D makes you feel immersed

What I did NOT like:
* Jay-Z failed miserably in pulling together a modern version of the jazz culture represented in the original novel - there is absolutely NO PARALELL between Hip Hop and authentic Jazz, the former not qualifying in many people's minds as music (it being rhythmic speaking set to borrowed sounds) and the latter attaining true art stature - the result was the soundtrack equivalent of a loud belch during a melodic opera - rude, crude, and NOT appreciated; to see anachronism done right, watch the Baz Lurhman prequel to this, better known as Moulin Rouge
* While I am nearly positive that the visually stunning first half of the movie dropping suddenly to a nearly dreary last half of the movie was done on purpose, the contrast in styles from beginning to end was clumsily done - almost like the art department changed hands mid-way thru and the new team had a different vision of what the flick should look like

I finally rented it here from Amazon and I was wishing I had bought a Bluray copy at the end. It starts out big. All the fanfare of Hollywood and the roaring twenties, that's the first hour.

Like the book, all the glitz and glamour wears off in the second half when you learn who Gatzby is. That's when it becomes less about glamour and more of a drama to tell the actual story.

It followed the story as I see it in my head--over-the-top decadence, alcoholism, infidelity, love, missed opportunities, and loathing. I was thrilled with the modern soundtrack, the sets, the costumes, the camera shots--all the glitz and glamour the story deserves.

although it may not be as good as the book, it truly was well done.  I enjoyed this film with my 14 year old daughter who watched it
a second time...without any ideas pre notioned she truly attached herself to the story, and honestly we talked about the movie
for days after.  I don't think many of today's movies move me much, not to mention most movies are being cut short timewise,
leave little converstion afterwards and by no means are worth the 15 dollar ticket price, but this one in my personal opinion was
worth it.  The acting was done very well by leonardo Dicaprio, and he has grown into the roll very well.  My daughter ended up disliking the character of Daisy due to her selfish ways and heart made of greed...I think she really thought things out here and hopefully walked away with a new view of how money can change people not always for the better in life.  I would recommend this to others to see...it does make you stop and think when too much of anything can turn everything ugly and sour...and make people very empty, lonely, selfish, greedy and always looking for more...great material, great music and overall great cast.",1378166400,,1274,4.565789473684211

4972069,1,B0067EKYS6,"I gave this movie one star because I didn't like it.  Here's why. Movie makers these days have made movies from Graphic Novels.  Baz Luhrman makes a Graphic Novel out of a movie.  His energetic CGI infused style works in some cases but not in all. In my opinion, it didn't work for Gatsby.  The hot, hazy, at times, sultry summer was depicted as a sharp, clear constant party wherein the characters were lost.  Perhaps it's the clarity of CGI and High Def that turned me off.  But the casting didn't seem to fit as well.  I think Leonardo DiCaprio is a terrific actor and I love most of his films.  But this one...not so much.  He looked and sounded very uncomfortable when ending his sentences with the signature words ""old sport"".  I cringed with each utterance.  The words didn't seem natural for him.  I'm not a fan of Tobey Macguire and don't understand Hollywoods fascination with him.  I didn't even like him in Spiderman. But again, just my opinion.  The rest of the cast, as far as I'm concerned, were forgettable.  The 1974 Robert Redford film, while not the best of movies, was much better than this one.  Except for Bruce Dern, the cast fit easily into the 20's era. Finally, some movie remakes should not be made.  Time to leave this one alone and move on to a fresh original story.",1378166400,5,1295,4.489270386266094

This movie is great, could not ask for a better pairing between Dicaprio and Mcquire.  The story is a classic American Novel, and the movie ""does the book justice"" which is fairly rare in my opinion with most movies based on books. I have tried watching the original movie several times but never made in past the intro because it is slow and seems to drag on endlessly. This is not the case with this version, action, adventure and love abound in this version of the movie.

Bottom line, Its absolutely worth the $5.00 rental fee, its absolutely worth the purchasing fee but I will tell you if you are on the fence at all spend the $5.00 and enjoy a great ride to a different time in American History.",1378166400,,852,4.3125

Leonardo DiCaprio did a spot-on job of portraying Gatsby as Fitzgerald penned him, and I thought that was true of just about every other character as well; special kudos to Ms. Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan.

4972084,1,B0067EKYS6,"Sorry to say, I watched this movie in intervals. I simply could not place myself into the story. Not a one of the characters was interesting or identifiable or relatable to oneself (at least not to me). Most of the time in movies there is at least one sympathetic character to whom the audience can relate or with whom or for whom one could find sympathy or empathy -- not the case in this remake. I found myself feeling somewhat embarrassed for the actors. They surely will not be remembered favorably for these roles.

I recall the original (the earlier) movie with Redford and Farrow, and my memory of their acting is/was much better and their characters much keener and on point. I truly feel that this remake was a total waste of time and money. Every second of it seemed phony. ""Boring"" is a word I do not often use with movies, but this one certainly was. There was a lot of senseless noise and action; nothing advanced the story enough for me to watch more than five minutes at a time.

Generally, I like Leonardo, but even he fell completely flat in this movie.

As a friend of mine used to way, when describing something so unentertaining: ""I'd rather sit on the porch and watch grass grow."" That's my feeling, too.",1378080000,10,1225,4.484304932735426

4972089,3,B0067EKYS6,"Sick & Stupid Score: 3/7*

Hollywood directors and screenwriters these days have the artistic maturity of a 15-year old.  Having been brought up on video games, comic books and throwaway MP3s, they seem to be completely incapable of understanding the subtleties of art, literature, and music.  Hollywood's latest attempt at a film version of ""The Great Gatsby"" is sadly just another example.

After about 30 minutes of Roaring 20s hype--scenes filled with loud period music absurdly mixed with modern hip-hop, exaggerated dance routines, bizarre costumes, comical art deco sets, and ridiculous computer graphics, all carried along on a tidal wave of alcohol--the movie finally settles down to the business of telling a story.

If you make it through those opening scenes without being blinded, rendered deaf, or deeply insulted by the infantilism of the performance, you might extract some entertainment and enlightenment from the rest of the movie.  That probably depends on how familiar you are with F. Scott Fitzgerald's work, and how much you desire to see whether the movie succeeds in bringing his story to life on the screen.

The acting is competent, but the characters are flat, especially the female characters.  Cinematically, the viewer gets the impression that the director has watched ""Citizen Kane"" too many times, and the screenwriter has aided and abetted this addiction by having Gatsby gasp ""Daisy"" in his dying moments, rather than whispering ""Rosebud.""

* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

4972091,2,B0067EKYS6,"Despite the filmmakers' efforts to adapt the well-known novel into a palatable movie for 2013, ""The Great Gatsby"" serves as a cautionary tale for anyone bent on changing the source material.  Sometimes things are best left alone.  Director Baz Luhrmann unwisely plays up a romantic angle.  This miscalculation dooms what could have been a stylish update of a popular book.  What's the real story?  Gatsby is a man who believes that he can buy the American Dream (and pretty much anything else he desires).  Instead of this picture taking the time to get know its central figure and depict his inevitable fall, the script puts a `Romeo and Juliet'-type spin on his story.  This misses the whole point of the novel.  Also, Daisy isn't supposed to be a likable character, but this fact didn't stop the producers from trying to make her so.  What all this boils down to is one should never adapt a story if they intend to dramatically change the characters motivations.  When motives and intentions are altered, the original structure ceases to exist.  The end result of this adaptation is an empty work brought down by its pointless misdirections and unfulfilling ambitions.",1378080000,,1171,4.923469387755102

4972093,3,B0067EKYS6,"...I would not have watched this movie. Personally the original movie, with Mia Farrow and Robert Redford, was qualitatively better. If one was to ask an older generation, I am sure that the original would prove to be quantitatively better as well. I did not care for most of the music in the film, though a couple of the renditions were okay. Also, as a fan of the book, there was a particular dialogue that made the book and the original movie that was critically altered in this film, ""rich girls don't marry poor boys"" (Daisy to Gatsby in the book and in the 1974 film). In the new film this line was muttered by an insignificant character to Carroway in reference to his crush on Ms. Jordan Baker. Also, the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy is a bit skewed. In all, I gave the film three stars because of the things mentioned above and because the direction was not stellar, nor was the cinematography (which was jerky and disorienting at times). As a long time fan of Leo DiCaprio, I hate to give a film he stars in a less than stellar review. I would urge everyone who has not read the book or seen the 1974 film to do so and judge for yourself.

The mental hospital?  Seriously?  That's a cheap stab at psychoanalysis that became popular in the '20's and totally un-neccessary. Why not write lines for ""Zelda"" and just get the cheap shot over with.

One star for the attempt by the cast to give pathos to the Hindenburg of movies.

This was an amazing love story between Daisy and Gatsby, and you hoped all would go well since the ""husband"" was a brute. Contrary to the desires of how the story would end, Daisy is just a shallow human being and leaves you feeling so sad for Gatsby. I loved this movie because I love the character Gatsby...full of hopes and dreams. It is sad at the end, but I still would watch this movie 50 times.

  -At 2.5 hours it still moved fast enough to stay interesting.

Bad Things:
  -The updated soundtrack was as annoying as the music from the 20's and I found it a distraction more than a nice update.
  -Way too much CGI!!!  Is it really necessary to computerize a tree?  For this kind of story I find it hard to believe that shooting a real bay
  would be that expensive.  Many parts of the movie came off as almost a cartoon.
  -The 3-D idea is really getting old as too many aspects are put in for the affect alone.  When you are watching in 2-D it is very contrived.",1377993600,3,1119,4.269230769230769

4972117,3,B0067EKYS6,"Ah well.  Not nearly as well acted as the 1970's original, but in terms of energy, this ""Gatsby"" makes the Redford version seem comatose.  It's also a ""Gatsby"" for our age.  I thought the modern music would drive me nuts, but in fact it acts as a bridge between our era and the 'Twenties.  We may have some wild parties, but a bunch of kids in hoodies just isn't quite as decadent as kids in tuxes and gowns.  And illegal booze is quite a bit different than illegal speed, or ecstasy.

On the other hand, where it counts, in the acting, a Madonna video has more depth.  Toby McGuire is practically invisible, a wide-eyed shadow.  Carey Mulligan never seems to change her expression.  And DiCaprio...  When he doesn't say anything he's at his most convincing.  When he talks he sounds like someone faking his dialect, badly.  And when he gets nervous he reminds me of Hitler---the clumsy way he wipes his hand over his hair to push it into place.  Like everyone else, I found Elizabeth Debicki by far the most compelling character to watch, although I must say, when they first go into NYC, to the aparment Tom keeps for his mistress, that set, and the women in it are all quite a picture to behold---the use of green on one actress and red, green and yellow on Myrtle both suggests colorized film and black and old fruit crate label art.

When Fitzgerald wrote ""The Great Gatsby"", WWI was a sharp wound in the collective consciousness.  Today it's locked up deep within our collective amnesia, like the grave of a supposed hero that always presents embarrassing truths each time someone opens the casket.  You don't need to understand the impact of WWI to enjoy the book or either movie, but it certainly helps.  It wasn't just illegal booze and short skirts that made the twenties, but the escape from the horror of an utterly unnecessary war we never should have entered, where corporations profited to epic excess, and where not only were there no good guys, but the ending was so unsatisfying, everyone knew another war was imminent, just as they knew the prosperity couldn't last forever.  That's why this movie is such a ""Gatsby"" for our age.  With 9/11 still too close behind us to forget, and too many questions we're afraid to answer, we know we're on the edge of an abyss;  wealth abounds, and if you can't see it in the flesh, it permeates our media.  This can't last, something bad is going to happen, and yet we don't know what to do, so we keep on shopping, keep on partying.

No, ""The Great Gatsby"" of 2013 is not the best version of the book, but then again, either was the 1973 version.  They're both flawed, neither can quite deliver the book to the silver screen, but for me, the energy and visuals of this one make it far more watchable than the 1970's snooze fest;  the other one had more developed characters and this one has the better look.  I'll take this one.",1377907200,,2885,4.523166023166024

4972119,4,B0067EKYS6,"This latest effort to bring F. Scott Fitzgerald's words to the big screen succeeded well enough. We are introduced to the narrator, Nick Carraway (played by Tobey Maguire), as having been committed to a sanitarium for alcoholics. His doctor asks him to put to paper his thoughts, as a form of therapy. As he writes, the words seemingly come to life and the story of his friend Gatsby unfolds. The movie resembles the director's other flashy spectacle, Moulin Rouge, using many of the same tracking crowd shots and crotch shots. Almost all of the film's scenery appears to be CGI, save for the close up interior shots. It seemed to have an animation quality to it that I found unsettling. Thankfully the acting was good, especially the part of Daisy played by Carey Mulligan, and the small part of Myrtle the mistress played by the capable Isla Fisher. Rounding out the ensemble is relative newcomer Elizabeth Debicki who just killed it as Daisy's gal pal, professional golfer Jordan Baker. Of course who would argue that Leo DiCaprio didn't make a great Gatsby. As one of my literary friends said ""Who else could play a super rich guy better than a super rich actor?"" To which I replied ""A good actor can play rich or poor, regardless of their own wealth or upbringing."" It's interesting because Leo has played all levels of the social strata. And while some might say he was the perfect choice to play Gatsby, I tend to disagree. Yes, Gatsby was a poor boy who made it big, but his conspicuous consumption lifestyle was a means to an end. His huge parties, poppin' bottles & touchin' models, was all for the sole purpose of getting Daisy to come back into his life, now that he had made it. I felt that DiCaprio attempted to convey this desperate longing and hopefullness but it didn't quite strike me as convincing. Suave and debonair as he is, I don't think he is (even acting) as suave and debonair as the character of Jay Gatsby.

Rarely does the movie pause for a breath, and when it does, brace yourself, because the effects people are about to unleash more visual overload. DeCaprio almost pulls it off, but he is about the only thing in the movie that works, and he is too often betrayed by whipsaw cutting and a camera that can't stand still. Perhaps most annoying of all, nearly all the outdoor scenes are filmed on obvious indoor sets with false looking landscapes digitally inserted. One hundred forty three minutes of your life irretrievably lost, time that might have been better spent pulling your toenails out one by one.",1377907200,9,825,4.9855072463768115
4972125,2,B0067EKYS6,"The 1974 film adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" starring Mia Farrow and Robert Redford shines in comparison to this Baz Luhrmann interpretation.  That's not to say that Carey Mulligan and Leonardo DiCaprio as former flames Daisy and Gatsby (respectively) didn't do a very good job.  Tobey Maguire as Daisy's cousin, Nick (also the film's narrator) did especially excellent work attempting to add depth to a very shallow production. But overall, this movie is more spectacle than substance.  Seemingly taking for granted that everyone is familiar with the story of a ""self-made"" man trying to recapture the past and steal the woman he lost years ago away from her ""old money"" husband and lifestyle on Long Island, NY -- relationships and characters are not developed at all.  Instead, the movie focuses on frenetic visuals and relies on Nick's voice over to provide the narrative.

I streamed the movie in HD and it is quite lush and beautiful; however, it is also obvious that it was shot to be viewed in 3-D and images frequently seemed to be coming at me from the TV.  In addition, the camera has a very limited atttention span for most of the movie, jumping from image to image, scene to scene at a frenzied pace.  This works kind of okay during high-energy party scenes (of which there are too many) or when cars are racing down the road, but the roller-coaster-ride-like editing significantly detracts from any actual story telling (of which there is too little).  The juxtaposition of Fitzgerald's ripe and serious words with over-the-top scenery, staging and cinematography makes the whole thing seem farcical.  Fitzgerald sometimes worked as a Hollywood screenwriter, but he meant for ""The Great Gatsby"" to be his great American novel; ultimatey, the pages of a book may just be the medium for which his story is best-suited.

There are glimpses of the story's heart in the movie.  The best scene is when Gatsby reveals his relationship with Daisy to her husband in front of Daisy, Nick, and their friend, Jordan (played very entertainingly by Elizabeth Debicki). The camera finally takes a back seat and the actors are allowed to meaningfully interact with each other.  And again, Tobey Maguire is quite adept at conveying his point of view in every scene he's in, even if he has no lines and is being upstaged by grandiose sets or the 21st century soundtrack, which is so out of place.

If you're familiar with the novel (and if you're not you may feel lost watching this movie), you'll notice that this screenplay takes quite a few liberties.  It is ironic that the movie ends with Nick reciting the last words of the book verbatim, which convey what the story is supposed to be about: the elusive American dream that we continue to believe in long after the possibility of realizing it has faded.  Fitzgerald made it clear that Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy is a metaphor for this. The problem is, the two hours plus of the movie that precede those final words need to support that, and they don't.  Instead, they convey that the 1920's were actually roaring.  Yes, the ambience of the movie does a good job of portraying the opulance and ""anything goes"" mentality of the Jazz Age.  But that ambience consumes everything, including any social/moral commentary because it's hard to take seriously anything that's so over-the-top.  Personally, this period in American history boasts my favorite architecture and fashion, but too much is too much!  The movie also would have been better served by keeping references to bootlegging and criminal activity as subdued as they were in the book; Gatsby comes off too much like a gangster here, making Nick's elevation of him odd.

It would have been interesting, given that the themes of the story carry through to today, if Baz Luhrmann had updated the time period and not just the score, and explored what a 21st Century Gatsby would look like.  But the creativity in this Gatsby lies in the choice of upstaging the story with spectacle; if you choose to watch it, do so for that or you'll be disappointed.  I might have enjoyed it better if I'd seen it in a theatre.",1377907200,9,4117,4.825035561877667

Luhrman brought contemporary music and flashy style without letting it dominate the movie, and I ended the movie the same way I finished the book--with a deep sense of melancholy.

He finally comes into the character in the last scenes, and in those, is really good.  Toby McGuire is vacant; without the writing tool used in the movie he has no personality at all.  Carey Mulligan is a picture of Daisy; the depth of character and beginnings of her madness are not there.  She never has those 'Zelda'  moments which gave meaning to her part in the story.  The best character in this version is Jordan; Isla Fischer is beautiful and conveys her character, the times, everything with only few words; in her facial expression and movement there is a true depth that draws attention.  Found myself wanting to hear more from her.  The story is lost.  There is no mention or appearance of Daisy's child at all until the last; one is left wondering where she came from and when, unless you know the book.  The best part of the screenplay is the use of Fitzgerald's amazing closing lines and the green light......

4972145,4,B0067EKYS6,"From the encyclopedia the facts are here: `The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.' Pretty well said and for those many of us who have read the novel that straightforward description serves Fitzgerald's story well.

Enter Baz Luhrmann who adapted Fitzgerald's novel with his constant co-writer Craig Pearce (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet, Strictly Ballroom) and director this Rose Parade Float version of Gatsby and the emphasis is different from the book - and that really is OK; it is a visualization of the raucous flamboyance of the Roarin' 20s pushed to extremes and decorated with Luhrmann's fetish for across time music themes and songs. The story remains intact for the most part as narrated by faux writer Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and the epitome of the American Dream Jay Gatsby is pasted on Leonardo DiCaprio while the vapid Daisy is well underplayed by Carey Mulligan. The spectacle settles down for moments offering some fine cameos by Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan, spectacularly beautiful and talented Elizabeth Debicki in the small but significant role as Jordan Baker, Isla Fisher as the doomed Myrtle Wilson, Jason Clarke as Myrtle's husband George Wilson, and Callan McAuliffe as the teenage Jay Gatsby plus a `cast of thousands'. It places rich man poor man and the opportunities for role reversal at a new level and Luhrmann and company make that happen. Yes, it is overdone and over the top as is Luhrmann's style, and no, I wouldn't watch it again, but as entertainment on the grand scale it is not bad!

4972146,2,B0067EKYS6,"If you start from the premise that this is a film about the corruption of wealth, and the failure of the Great American Dream, as Fitzgerald I think intended, then it really falls short of its palpable objective. Now its unfair to compare this film to ""Citizen Kane"", agruably one of the finest films ever made, but it is essentially the same theme. Gatsby, is also Kane, in his own way, from the humblest of circumstances, destroyed by wealth (as the script of ""Kane"" reads (sic): ""You know, if I hadn't have had wealth, then I might have been a really great man"".Indeed, Kane's wealth and power will not get him back to ""Rosebud"", or in Gatsby's case, ""Daisy"". However, does Dicaprio really have the swagger of Orson Welles? Does he exhibit the similar defiant charm? I think he is a great actor with terrific presence, maybe one of the best actors of a generation. Think of him in ""The Departed"". But, in this role, Leo sadly falls short, really flailing about as to whether the character should display arrogant charm or a devoted and sad sensitivity. And, Mulligan as ""Daisy"" is a disaster. She is a lovely ""dishrag"", completely devoid of any of the characteristics that would inspire such devotion and enduring love in Gatsby. I really want her to drink a few expressos. Finally, the entire opening sequence of parties, meant to set the stage for a ""Jazz Age"" is completely coarse, glaring, and ""in your face"" to the point where you want to turn the movie off. Perhaps, this is, the producers thought, the only kind of ""bling"" that would lure a modern, jaded crowd to the viewing of one of the greatest classics of literature, written both sparely, with the plainest kind of sincerity, and a vision of horror and tragedy engendered by a driven search for wealth that is, really, only a search for self. This is a small novel, but filled with great meaning and powerful images/symbols. If only someone could make a version that was also simple, small, and seriously engaging, show-casing the great depth of its characters. It is a difficult novel to transform into film, but this version, sadly, only scratches the surface.",1377734400,,2128,4.723118279569892

The very best direction and editing was given to the introduction of Gatsby with Gershwin's Rhapsody in the background.  Truly one of the best scenes of any movie.,1377734400,,330,4.466666666666667
4972148,1,B0067EKYS6,"Awful cinematography. Just a bad movie altogether. We were disappointed, we were hoping for a movie that did the book justice.",1377734400,4,126,5.0476190476190474
4972149,4,B0067EKYS6,"I actually started this book and gave up on it, because it was just too ""wordy"" and therefore a bit boring. (Why do some of these books become ""classics""?  I just don't know).  Anyway, I realize the book was written in the ""style"" of the times, and ""keep it pithy"" was not their motto.  So I decided to try the movie, just out  of curiosity.  And besides, I like Leonardo!

Well!  I was sort of mezmorized, sort of shocked, and sort of turned off a little (too much rap - more on that later).  One thing I WASN'T, was bored! This movie never drags - not once.  Although it may appear a bit frantic and disjointed, it's actually very easy to follow since a lot of it is narrated by the main character (played by Toby Macquire).

In the movie, which is set in 1922, a frustrated writer goes to live in NY, and becomes a bonds trader.  He happens to live right next door to Jay Gatsby, a mysterious guy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who dwells in a huge mansion and throws lavish parties every weekend.  There is cheating, there is a compelling love story, and there is (obviously) loads of sex, although they never actually ""show"" anything....while Toby MacQuire's character is sort of an ""observer"" of it all.  Eventually, he becomes friends with this mysterious Gatsby, and learns all his secrets.

And, there is also....rap?  Rap in the 20's?  I remember thinking...whhhaaaaat????  This doesn't belong here!  I think the movie would have been much better if they had adhered to musical pieces from that time-frame...there are plenty of rioutous jazzy tunes to choose from, I'm sure.  It was the roaring 20's, after all.  The rap music was just weird...it didn't fit...and it sort of takes you out of the movie.  Why not stick to music of the times?  Why are we just catering to teens and people in their early 20's all the time?  Why not just do what's right for the movie?  Anyway, that was really my main problem with the movie, although I just convinced myself to ""go with it.""

Also, I wish there had been more character development.  Maybe the main character could have told us a little more about his feelings - even if that wasn't in the original story, they could have added it in.

Other than these problems, I did enjoy the movie for what it's worth....this version of The Great Gatsby is unique, interesting, and ""larger than life.""  Plus,like I said, it is definitely NOT boring!  There is a loose plot, so be patien, even if the movie seems a bit ""plotless"" at first.

This movie is worth seeing, whether you've read the book or not.  I am glad we bought it, because I probably will watch it again.  The Great Gatsby is good for teens on up - not for really young children, of course.",1377734400,5,2698,4.4989690721649485
4972150,3,B0067EKYS6,"First, I'd like to say that I do like this film, and have seen it several times. It's very entertaining, and certainly colorful, with fine performances and wonderful sets, but it just isn't a great film, and I can't give it more than three stars. I'm not sure this version of ""Gatsby"" would be recognized by its original creator. After the first 15 minutes or so I began to wonder if Fitzgerald's story had been rewritten by a graphic-novelist. The film seems cartoonish, somehow, and I couldn't quite believe in Gatsby or Daisy; they just seem too round-faced and, (despite DiCaprio's wrinkles), young.

  Who on earth would ever imagine Gatsby as DiCaprio? There's absolutely nothing mysterious about him. His performance was identical to all of his performances; I don't think he's capable of being anyone but Leo. His accent is bizarre, definitely not Midwestern, or New York, or Oxford. Exactly what was he shooting for? Carey Mulligan may be cute, but it's very hard for me to picture anyone, even DiCaprio, investing so much effort towards winning her heart. They both look about 15 years old, they'll probably still look like teenagers when they're 60. And what's up with casting Spiderman as Gatsby's minion? Unfair, I admit, McQuire's a decent actor, but the Spidey image is not easily shed.

  As for the soundtrack, there are so many problems with it that I don't even know where to start, but the first thing that comes to mind is the Rap music. Others may disagree, but when I watch a movie set in the 1920s, with costumes that are vaguely reminiscent of the era, and the word ""jazz"" is flung around from time to time, I don't want to hear anything that sounds like Rap.  There's virtually no jazz, although there are some songs that sound like they might be popular music from that era; lyrical songs, of course. All those lyrics are very distracting. Songs with lyrics are used to accompany strongly emotional scenes, something that's generally not done in movies aimed at an adult audience. The soundtrack doesn't support the story, instead, it seems to be jumping up and down screaming for attention.

  Come to think of it, each element of the film, the music, the costumes, the sets, the clever dialogue, tries too hard to be noticed.  There's no sense of restraint, and it doesn't add up to an integrated whole. All of the glittering facets may catch your eye, (and your ear), but they don't capture your heart. That's unfortunate, because, in my opinion, the film's makers have totally missed the point. Somewhere in the middle of all the flashy sets, the pumping music and the special effects,  the story got lost.",1377734400,4,2637,4.784140969162996

4972153,4,B0067EKYS6,"My favorite film of 2013, the severely underrated, The Great Gatsby finally arrives on Blu-ray 3D this week in a nice, full featured set.

Movie

I don't think I've ever read The Great Gatsby. I know it is required reading in a lot of High School English Lit classes, but I'm fairly certain, surprisingly enough, that I didn't take English Lit - not even in College (I took French and Spanish instead). Always the practical one, who knew that I'd end up being ""forced"" to read all the classics anyway?

After a string of misfires (I hated Shutter Island and Inception) Leonardo DiCaprio returns to form. He is perfect as Gatsby. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. Gatsby is a complicated, yet simple man. His entire existence is his desire to get the girl, Daisy (Carey Mulligan) that he foolishly let go of.

This is a role that was tailor made for DiCaprio. If DiCaprio wasn't already an A list mega star, this movie would have made him one. He just oozes off the screen and is simply radiant here (can I use the word radiant to talk about a guy?).

In any other hands, Daisy could easily be hated and come across as shallow, naive, and as someone just going through life, but Mulligan brings a lot of hidden layers to Daisy. You can see the inner conflict through her expressive eyes.

As wild and over the top as Moulin Rouge Director Baz Luhrmann usually is; The Great Gatsby is his most assured, straightforward, gimmick free (not counting 3D) film to date. From a pure story telling and directing standpoint it is by the numbers. There are very few scenes that made me feel like I took a bad acid trip. Even the party scenes are beautifully shot and framed here.

Much has been written about the modern mixing of Hip Hop with 20's era Jazz and how it wouldn't work. Luhrmann actually did an amazing job of not overdoing the gimmick. Yes, it is noticeable, but he uses it very sparingly, so it never took me out of the movie.

There was one scene when they were on the bridge and they passed a car that had rich black people in and they were playing Jay-Z's Izzo (HOVA). It was odd and random just to have rich black people appear out of nowhere. I loved Luhrmann use of various versions Lana Del Rey's song Young and Beautiful in the love scenes. It really added texture and emotion to the romance.

One of the most beautiful moments in the movie comes when Gatsby is lamenting everything that he's lost, and Tobey Maguire (Nick Carraway) says, ""You can't repeat the past"" and Gatsby responds with an earnest ""Of course you can old sport,"" such a simple but impactful moment.

Generally, I'm not a fan of narration, but Maguire does an amazing job with the lyrical prose used in this movie. Maguire gives a mature, nuanced performance here where you can really see his love and infatuation for Gatsby grow while his distaste for his friend Tom Buchannan (a wonderfully evil Joel Edgerton) increases. At times it almost seemed as if Nick wanted to jump Gatsby's bones.

This is my favorite film of 2013. It hit all my buttons - beautifully shot, very hopeful (but with an ultimately sad end), and had some flashes of brilliant prose.

Video/Audio/Packaging

This movie received a lot of flack because it was pulled from its original release date and delayed by 6 months so that Luhrmann could add 3D. I'm here to tell you the 3D really doesn't ad much to this film, yeah there is some good depth to it, but it seems like a gimmick and pretty pointless. I preferred the regular 2D Blu-ray version.

The quality on the Blu-ray 3D is solid, if I'm looking directly at it, however if I lay down on my couch it become basically unwatchable. Lack of viewing angles is one of the drawbacks to using Passive 3D technology, but normally they aren't this off.

In this day and age, can we get rid of letterboxing? Please? I have a large screen television for a reason; I don't want half my screen taken up with black bars. The Blu-ray 3D would have been more eye-popping if it used full screen. Other than the letterboxing issue, the transfer is almost flawless. There are a couple of scenes that purposefully has some grain to help establish the time period.

At $29 (Amazon price) this is the most ""expensive"" Blu-ray 3D set that I've purchased all year and the packaging is cheap as heck. There are three discs and the Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D discs don't even have individual holders - just two discs slapped together.

There's no artwork on the two Blu-ray disks, just Gatsby written on it in a fuggly font. Looks like some amateur bootleg disk, not a professional $30 Blu-ray 3D set. What was WHV thinking? Oh, I know, ""We'll do a better job with an extended version in a few months.""

Extras

The Extras on this set are nicely laid out and contain a lot of solid information about every aspect of creating this movie. I kind of wish there was just one full length documentary (broken into individual featurettes), because it felt like I was hunting and pecking through the menu.

It was weird that the Blu-ray 3D trailer is on the Blu-ray disc, but not the actual Blu-ray 3D itself. I mean what do I get out of seeing an ad for Blu-ray 3D in 2D?

There is One Trailer for Gravity

1926 The Great Gatsby Trailer (1 min, HD) - This long lost trailer is a fun look at the old silent film classic.

Within and Without with Tobey Maguire (8 mins, HD) - Tobey Maguire brings his camera on set for some rare moments with Co-Stars and Director Baz Luhrmann

The Swinging Sounds of Gatsby (12 Min, HD) - This feature looks at the amazing, eclectic score that blends the sound of Jazy-Z, Bryan Ferry and other contemporary artists with classic 20s era jazz

The Jazz Age (15 Min, HD) - A nice, detailed look at the history of the Jazz Age and the parties that inspired it.

Razzle Dazzle: The Fashion of the 20s (15, HD) - This is exactly what the title says, a look at the fashions of the 20s.

Fitzgerald's Visual Poetry (7 min, HD) - Baz talks about the importance of using 3D for this film to create ""poetic glu.""

Gatsby Revealed (30 Min, HD) - This is essentially a 30 minute documentary (broken up into several pieces) that delves into various aspects of how various scenes were created and staged. Very well done.

Deleted Scenes - There are three deleted scenes, one of which includes an Alternate Ending. The Alternate ending is interesting because it shows Gatsby's father coming to pay his respects and there was a romance between Nick and Jordan that unfortunately got cut because Baz didn't have enough time to fully flesh it out.

Digital UV Copy - After spending a lot of time complaining about UltraViolet and clutching onto iTunes, I'm now fully onboard and love the idea of it. When UV first started, my primary issue was all the various sign-ups and the fact that I could not play the digital files anywhere. In the last 8 months UV has become almost as ubiquitous as Netflix. I can get UV through Vudu, CinemaNow and Flixter and all those apps are available on every connected device (TVs, Blu-ray Players, Game Consoles) I have. As much as I love iTunes, it annoys me that I had to buy two Apple TVs just to watch my digital copies on my TV.

With that said, I hate having a fractured digital library - I have 300 UVs and 100 iTunes now, so I wish studios would provide both UV and iTunes copies. It is also annoying that Digital Copies don't include the extra features and that services like Vudu sell bonus materials separately and that iTunes Extras don't even work on Apple TV.

Conclusion

This movie is the ultimate love story about a man that would and did do everything he could to gain back what he lost. Having never read the book, I can't comment on what has been changed but it is a movie that everyone should enjoy. This Blu-ray 3D package is disappointing, I'm not sure what I expected, but I wanted more than was delivered. Even so, it is hard to be mad when I love this movie as much as I do. The sloppy packaging, the outrageous price and the annoying letterboxing are the only things holding this back from an A+.

As far the presentation of the box goes, it is the typical cardboard slider on top of the Bluray box that has lenticular printing on the front. It has most of the characters, while I think the other presentations only have Leo on them. What I found odd was that when I opened the box one of the disks was loose and there are only two places to put the disks in but there are 3 disks. I assumed since they are thinner than normally, two would fit on the same side.",1377648000,,735,4.212765957446808
4972155,1,B0067EKYS6,"Rap music. In a movie set in the 1920s. During the JAZZ AGE.

Whatever potential this film might have had was utterly destroyed by the decision to lay a ""contemporary"" sound track over this classic story of love and decadence following WWI, when jazz and other new developments were changing American society. I am reminded of a version the Scarlet Letter which was produced a few years ago which tried to make adultery a virtue, which was NOT the way the original book was written.

How can you NOT use jazz music in a movie about the 1920s entertainment scene? That's like playing heavy metal music in a movie about Bach. It's like playing bluegrass music during the filming of Cleopatra. It's like playing Gilbert and Sullivan during the Hitler Files. It's bad enough that we're subjected to rap  music in 2013 without subjecting people in the 1920s to it.

If these people want to use their actors and entertainers in a vehicle, here's a concept: come up with an ORIGINAL STORY, one more suited to what you want to do.",1377648000,9,1022,4.629834254143646

4972158,5,B0067EKYS6,"""The Great Gatsby"" is great! This is how the story goes: Would-be writer Nick Carraway leaves the Midwest and comes to New York City in the spring of 1922, an era of loosening morals, glittering jazz, bootleg kings, and sky-rocketing stocks. Chasing his own American Dream, Nick lands next door to a mysterious, party-giving millionaire, Jay Gatsby, and across the bay from his cousin, Daisy, and her philandering, blue-blooded husband, Tom Buchanan. It is thus that Nick is drawn into the captivating world of the super rich, their illusions, loves and deceits. As Nick bears witness, within and without of the world he inhabits, he pens a tale of impossible love, incorruptible dreams and high-octane tragedy, and holds a mirror to our own modern times and struggles.

The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (great as Jay Gatsby), Tobey Maguire (as Nick Carraway), Carey Mulligan (as Daisy Buchanan), Joel Edgerton (as Tom Buchanan), Isla Fisher (as Myrtle Wilson) & Jason Clarke (as George Wilson) is great. The directing by Baz Luhrmann (who also produced and co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The screenplay (based on the novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald) by Luhrmann & Craig Pearce is great.

The music by Craig Armstrong is great. The cinematography by Simon Duggan is great. The film editing by Jason Ballantine, Jonathan Redmond & Matt Villa is great. The casting by Ronna Kress & Nikki Barrett is great. The production & costume design by Catherine Martin (who also produced) is great. The art direction by Damien Drew, Ian Gracie & Michael Turner is great. The set decoration by Beverley Dunn, set dressings by Ciaran Jordan & Sam Lukins is great. The special effects supervised by Dan Oliver & coordinated by Jasmin Lyford is great. The visual effects supervised by Mark Breakspear, Andy Brown, Tony Cole, Jon Cowley, Lindy DeQuattro, Julian Dimsey, Chris Godfrey & Lesley Robson-Foster, coordinated by Ann-Marie Blommaert, Michelle Cornwall, Zachary Mallett, Barry St. John, Katrina Taylor & Pip Wright is great. The stunts coordinated by Glenn Ruehland & Ashley Fairfield is great.

This is a great, well-crafted, well-made and great-looking film that is entertaining and well-done. This is a great film adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. Leonardo DiCaprio gives another great performance as Jay Gatsby, a character that is well-suited for him. Baz Luhrmann directs another great film that is an interesting pick of a movie to do. This was a long awaited and anticipated reunion of DiCaprio and Luhrmann, working together after nearly 17 years since ""Romeo & Juliet"". This is also an interesting and long-awaited / anticipated pairing of close childhood friends DiCaprio & Maguire. This is one of the best-looking films of the year and of the summer season, thus far.

4972159,2,B0067EKYS6,"It turns out that this is one of the few directors I absolutely hate. The same guy that made the monsterously awful ""Moulin Rouge"". When I started watching I thought to myself ""what's with all the needless semi dissolves, quick cuts, wipes and fades all dumped into the first few minutes?"" So I had this creepy feeling it was the same style as Moulin Rouge, and looked it up.

None other than the same hack. Just a mish mash of shots thrown in for no real reason. It was like he handed the reins to some person that likes gimmicky shots and said ""have at it"". Cheesy shots with cheesy animation and effects ruin the chance to suspend reality.

It calms down after the open, but the endless blue screens are obvious and stand out from the location shots. DiCaprio is turned into a cross between Jack Black in King Kong and  Rudee Vallee. If I have to hear ""old sport"" one more time I'll gag. Toby McGuire is replaying Spider Man without the suit as he narrates everything. Dressed like PeeWee Herman McGuire has that stupid wide eyed look as if he just saw a naked woman for the first time.

No. As you can guess, it was millions of miles from he Robert Redford version, which I always loved. This is a comic book version, with comic book colors and all the artistic beauty of a crayon colored poster with magic marker highlights. It was shot or processed in 3D because they knew it needed something to make people see it.

Pass on renting this, it should be on Netflix soon where it will be less painful to your pocket. Friends don't let friends watch bad remakes of great classics.

The reason I gave this a higher star was that I loved the story, and it really stuck close to the book, and i loved the actors in this film they did an amazing job. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance blew Robert Redford's performance as Gatsby away. The problem is the directing, it has the same problem that I personally didn't care for in Romeo + Juliet it is sooooo over-directed to the point where it all looks almost surreal.

Cast is wonderful, and I will even go as far as saying the more minor characters (Tom and Jordan) did an even better job than some others.  Mostly, the acting was amazing.  Daisy made you immediately interested, yet hate her more as the story went on which was perfect.  Gatsby was quite interesting and meaningful, but I feel as if he was too well-known to play the mystery part of the movie he should have been.  Too bad we all know how well he acts and exactly how he acts, so he didn't seem to portray the troubled and mysterious card very well, I felt.  But otherwise, he was brilliant.

The story itself was shown perfectly, and the CGI scenes were quite easily portraying the 1920s dramatic city.  And you really felt like all of the cast believed that they were in this era, because of the new rise in the rich and the decline of the desperate poor.  Speaking of this era, the costumes deserve a complete A+.  It was amazing to see the sets with all of the early 1900s immigrant-like styles, after many Europeans coming over and settling over here in the US; and this means a colorful wardrobe, which was shown off to the greatest effect.

They're not perfect.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Gatsby/dp/0743273567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Gatsby</a>&nbsp;by F. Scott Fitzgerald is not just the possible holder of the mythical title ""Great American Novel"", but one of the finest works of fiction period. A haunting, caustic look at wealth, money, decadence, love, and the American Dream, The Great Gatsby, in it's 50,000 words, manages to be both vividly written, hauntingly affecting, and timelessly relevant. Go on and read it. Your English teacher was right.

But how does it translate to film? Not seamlessly. I still have NO idea why it was released in 3D. This decision seems ultimately misguided; how many novels written in the Twenties are going to be released in the Third Dimension? The Catcher in the Rye? The Beyonc and Jay-Z and will.i.am black rap may seem questionable to purists, and certainly jarred a large portion of the audience I watched the film with. And do we really need CGI sets and zooming shoots and kinetic driving scenes in a film about excess in the Jazz Age? One of my big gripes with the film is with the (otherwise) emotional scene in the garden between Daisy and Gatsby. We should be swept up in their tale of doomed love, and in the phenomenal acting, but whatisthat? GREEN SCREEN. Obvious, fake GREEN screen in a scene in the garden. Cheap, or was it part of Baz Luhrmann's effect?

Endless debate can be sparked on these topics. The real issue for me is harder to pin down. The film...the performances...seemed so...HOLLOW. Like it was all colour and light and splendour on the outside, but inside it was empty and hollow and lifeless. Carrie Mulligan in particular felt so empty-headed and vapid.

Or was this all intentional? Was Mulligan's performance intended to represent that selfsame attribute of Daisy; empty-headed, filled with faux-girlish innocence that revealed a sad, tortured girl inside? Did the emptiness of The Great Gatsby represent the hollowness of the American Dream that Nick Carraway finds so evident? Does the vapidity of the characters Gatsby and Tom and Daisy reflect the vapidity and fickleness that our narrator, Nick Carraway uncovers? I don't rightly know...

But the movie wasn't terrible. The Great Gatsby has a lot of things going for it.

The first half of the film has almost palpable energy. The Jazz Age was a terrific time to be alive, and Luhrmann shows us the wondrous new land of New York according to the relatively innocent Nick Carraway; cheap booze, flappers, the Charleston, riotous parties, confetti, fireworks, Jazz, big cars, grand castles, mysterious people, and lots and lots of money. In short, this is decadence and excess to the full.

A pity then, that it seems to lose this vigour in the second half. Again, maybe this is intentional and it's all me. The tonal shift is abrupt - from happy to sad - but the film works on mostly thanks to it's talented cast.

This is an incredibly versatile, charismatic, talented, and potentially brilliant actor at the top of his game. Reading the book, it is almost impossible to imagine how Gatsby could be realized onscreen, so dashing and larger-than-life was he. But DiCaprio makes it happen. He is suave, charismatic, sophisticated, sympathetic, mysterious, and charming. He is also a twisted, heartbroken, often deluded and complex soul. His multi-faceted performance is another star in his crown, which includes Blood Diamond, The Departed, Django Unchained, and hopefully many more to come. We're sorry for underestimating you, Leo.

His Nick Carraway was spot. on! Maguire captures the wide-eyed sensibility, innocence, and strong moral compass and decency of the character; not in a showy way, but in a sincere performance, becoming the focus of the audience's sympathies - Nick, who at times seems the most sane man in New York.

...

I give an abnormal amount of praise to Luhrmann's talented cast, because that is what impressed me most with the film. I liked the colour that assaulted the senses, the energy almost pulsing through the films veins, the colorful and diverse score (Lana del Rey's Young and Beautiful is particularly haunting), and the subtly brilliant performances from the cast.

The Great Gatsby left me feeling torn however. The enormous amounts of CGI and crane shots, coupled with the unnecessary 3D and the rap make this into a love-it or hate-it experience. I fall somewhere in between. I liked the movie. The Great Gatsby is like Tom Buchanan's riotous party early on in the film; new, original, colourful, exciting, but also hollow, misguided, and something that many people may want to stay away from.

4972191,3,B0067EKYS6,"`The Great Gatsby' was one of those films I really, truly wanted to love.  While not on the same level of anticipation as last years `Les Miserables', `The Great Gatsby' was extremely high on my list of films with the most potential to wow me this year.  I'm a huge fan of the novel.  Fitzgerald's most recognized work is an outstanding piece of literature, and having read it last year for the first time, it was one of those rare instances where all the hype surrounding a book represented it well.  I was blown away.  Having seen the 1974 film version years ago, I had this lingering air of disappointment resting in the back of my mind.  Coppola's Redford/Farrow helmed film was a boring mess and never really captured the magnificence or even poignancy of Fitzgerald's prose, which is shocking to be honest (you'd think that director and that cast would be aces).

Baz Luhrmann is never boring.

When news broke initially that Baz was going to be adapting this novel, I was nervous.  I love Luhrmann's style more than most and so I had no qualms with that aspect, but the fact that at the time all I had going on was the 1974 version (which bored me to tears) and the casting (Maguire, really?) has me thinking this was a bad idea.  Then I read the novel and became more intrigued by the prospect of Luhrmann doing for Gatsby what he did for Romeo.

I was hooked.

While the rest of the world cringed at every new development regarding this project (the stills, the trippy party scenes, the Jay-Z centered soundtrack, the casting of Carey Mulligan, the visual expansiveness) I was in hog-heaven; wet with anticipation.  I love the bold visual quality to Luhrmann's body of work.  No, I've never seen `Australia', but I have seen the rest of his films, and I personally consider `Romeo + Juliet' a masterpiece and consider `Moulin Rouge' close to one.  His sense of style and trashy elegance is profound and unmistakably authentic to his own vision.  He has undeniable showmanship, and while his films can become chaotic and almost trippy, he reigns in those formulas to create something inspired and endearing.  Sure, it doesn't seem like the obvious fit for Fitzgerald and yet that is what I loved so much about this project `in the making'.  It was so out of left field.  It didn't make sense, and because of that I was expecting absolute, unbridled G-R-E-A-T-N-E-S-S.

I kind of got M-A-D-N-E-S-S instead.

I don't want this to be a total bashing of the film, because I did not hate this, but unlike some film experiences, this did not rest better on me the more I thought about it.  The flaws here are too large to ignore, and while some flawed films make the most of their flaws over time (even those obnoxious close ups in `Les Miserables' can be argued as intimate after subsequent viewings), the more I think about `The Great Gatsby' the more uneasy I am over the overall product.  Still, there are certain aspects that deserve our attention (most notably the technical aspects and Joel Edgerton).

I'll talk about those first.

The film is lushly draped and a whole lot of fun to watch, from a purely visual standpoint.  Okay, the use of CGI was atrocious and made me really, really angry, but I'm talking about the clothes and sets right now.  The garments for each character were beautifully tailored and expertly crafted for each individual personality.  The use of angelic pastels for Daisy or gruff structure for Tom or silky smooth polish for Gatsby were all magnificently accurate.  The rooms, the showman's quality to each piece was jaw dropping in many respects.

The acting, for the most part, was really well done.  Carey Mulligan, despite initial concerns, was a wonderful Daisy.  She captured her free spirit trapped by her upper crust lifestyle and her imbedded selfishness that refused to allow her to completely follow her heart.  She had this breathy, almost adolescent take on Daisy's overall `act', but she managed to flesh out those final moments with her eyes to excruciating detail.  Newcomer Elizabeth Debicki was sensationally good as Jordon Baker.  I had high hopes for this particular performance because Lois Chiles delivers my favorite performance in Coppola's film and so I love what `can' be done with this character.  Debicki did all that and then some!  She handled her alluring tension, her unashamed material point of view and her dripping sensuality while capturing the era, the vibe and the bridled chaos of the city.  For me though, Joel Edgerton takes top honors.  Not only does he hold his accent marvelously (poor DiCaprio goes in and out too much) but he also etches out every layer of Tom's emotional complexity.  When reading the novel I was enamored with how layered this man was, and he instantly became one of my favorite literary villains.  Edgerton gets it so right here.  He captures Tom's sexual presence as well as his gruff exterior, his selfish tendencies and his control issues.  The panic in his eyes when he sees his world slipping is compelling, and the tension he brings to his neck when he faces Gatsby's rage is fantastic.  That laugh, that all knowing chuckle (that shakes in its attempt to mask his fears) is flawless, and his manipulative talk is authentic to a T.

DiCaprio is effective here, but the script doesn't help him much (I agree with those who say a drinking game on the utterances of `Old Sport' would result in alcohol poisoning) and Tobey Maguire is a mess.  His narration is awful (I hate his voice) and he really suffers at trying to bring some authenticity to his role.  It's a poorly executed performance, and I personally wish a younger and more talented actor had been cast.  The biggest disappointment for me was Isla Fisher.  I had such high hopes for this performance because I personally like her a lot and this character has so much meat, but instead she is relegated to a caricature who appears in one outlandish party scene and then, well, the car.

But that brings me to one of my biggest qualms with the film as a whole; Luhrmann.  I never thought that this would be my issue, mainly because I championed him taking a bold approach, but his boldness feels so half-baked here.  I told my wife as we left the theater that I wished he had taken it all the way or not bothered to take it there at all.  He had so many visual ideas, but he left them half-developed.  The first thirty minutes or so of the film is a chaotic exploitation of modern ideas infiltrating times past and then he almost gives up on that amalgam altogether and tries to give things a more respectable air.  It creates a disjointed atmosphere that doesn't hold up.  The sad part is that both divisions are flawed in their execution as well, and so you can't even say that one half is better than the other.  The chaotic scenes lack the proper editing to make them feel exciting.  The party scenes drag on too long and become repetitive and feel high-school trashy, not visionary trashy.  I'm someone who considers Luhrmann an auteur and so I expected more from him.  The drier parts of the film, while never boring, feel like they were ripped from a completely different film done by a different actor.  They almost have an amateurish quality to them.  Luhrmann's grasp of the material itself just feels so rudimentary, so surface.

He never digs deep enough, yet is contented with exploiting the obvious.

Now, while I applaud the lavish sets and costumes, the use of CGI was an embarrassment.  I understand that he was trying to create layers, and maybe in a 3D world this has better effect (I saw this in 2D), but I feel that any 3D film better work in 2D, and this one just felt like it was trying too hard.  The CGI was distracting, especially in the creation of landscapes (the shots of the car driving into the grimy district were horribly cartoonish) and the obnoxious car rides and complete insistence on giving us everything gave me a headache.  While I find Luhrmann's use of music in all of his films to be exciting and inspired, there were moments here that felt a tad beneath him in execution.  It felt like he was a new director trying really, really hard to be relevant and ultimately coming off as a poser of sorts.

But that Lana Del Rey song is heaven!

So there you have it.  I'm in the middle here.  I'll see this again, and I can't say I'd not recommend it.  It has a lot to offer, but at the end of the day I feel as though this is lesser Luhrmann and ultimately feels like a step backwards for the director.  He doesn't mesh his directorial approaches well and delivers to us a beautifully draped, awkwardly paced and ultimately fragmented take on a stunning literary piece.",1376524800,5,8672,4.634993446920053

I'm thankful though that some music of the period was included as well or it would have been unbearable, no matter how excellent the actors may have been.

4972196,5,B0067EKYS6,"Tackling a classical novel by turning it into a blockbuster is always going to be tough. Baz Luhrmann's Great Gatsby is stunning and sensational, but can't live up to Fitzgerald's original prose. In my opinion, though, it comes about as close as it can get.

The tale of Nick Carroway's induction both into decadent society and into the irrepressible, insane hopes of Jay Gatsy is told through a narrative framing device unique to this 2013 version of the story: Nick is a recovering alcoholic in the future, and tells the entire story to his psychiatrist, who urges him to write it down as a novel that just happens to sound exactly like the celebrated source material. This is clearly a way for the film to get away with a ton of narration. The film even explicitly shows the typed words on screen occasionally.

This whole thing is a bit questionable, as a film that adapts a book is supposed to stand by itself as a film, with as little narration as possible, and certainly without the actual words showing up on screen. However, the film is also admitting that the book is better at sounding good, so I can't really blame it for admitting the truth.

Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, and Carey Mulligan all tend to love this type of film: cool, slick, and cultured. They all act well, and fit their characters aptly. The film stands out in a couple ways. First, the CGI is thick and strong, giving the film a more surreal quality, and one that keeps it interesting. Chris Godfrey, the VFX supervisor, has posted a clip on Vimeo that points out just how much the CGI influenced the final product: [...]

It definitely establishes the excess and cheer of the 20s, though maybe not as subtly as the original text. The second stand-out element is the soundtrack. It uses modern artists -- Lana del Rey and Jay-Z, for instance -- to evoke the mood of the film, rather than using time-period-suitable musical choices. It's definitely a polarizing choice, as I've heard from people who loved it and hated it, but no one who didn't notice and form an opinion on it.

I like it: the soundtrack carries the same themes of hedonism and unrequited longing that are essential to the story, but uses them through fresh musical eyes, removing the feel of age and vintage that an older soundtrack would force on the audience. It's not the same as Fitzgerald imagined it, but that's because we could attain that mood after the decade has passed. I suppose the most accurate path to that mood would be to read the book, though. So if you enjoy this film, go check it out from your local library.",1376092800,3,2583,4.606521739130435
4972197,3,B0067EKYS6,"This is a film directed by Baz Luhrmann, the man behind ""Romeo + Juliet,"" a modern-day Shakespeare adaptation set in ""Verona Beach."" You either loved or hated it for its visual extravaganza, and now he has turned F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel into a film (and in 3D). While the film's lavish period costume (with a support from Prada and Miu Miu) captures the spirit of the jazz age, the script needs a lot of improvement.

I don't summarize the story here. I only report that the new film adaptation begins with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) in a sanatorium, writing down his past experiences as therapy. It is great to see veteran actor Jack Thompson as his doctor, but the unnecessary frame narrative device only slows down the film, removing us further from the titular hero we really want to meet.

After the visually dazzling party scene, we finally meet Jay Gatsby. Leonardo DiCaprio is effective as a man of colossal vitality, showing off his wealth for one purpose only. The film finally gets interesting as Jay Gatsby is reunited with Nick's second cousin Daisy (Carey Mulligan), Gatsby's dream girl, now married to rich and pompous Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).

Among the melodramatic contrivances and one-dimensional characters, DiCaprio's charismatic Gatsby stands out, and his friendship with Nick Carraway is one of the most credible aspects of the film. Unfortunately, beautiful as she is, Mulligan's Daisy, who should be more ethereal and enigmatic, just doesn't convince. Also, Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan appears as Meyer Wolfsheim, one of the strangest casting choices I have ever seen.

After all this is how Baz Luhrmann envision the world of Gatsby, the jazz age with dazzling visuals and hip-hop influenced soundtrack music. Although I like it for what it is, I also feel that it's time for the director to do something different.",1375920000,4,1870,5.061688311688312

And we started to wonder why the trailers were being shown (seemingly) 6-9 months before the movie was released. That had to be a bad sign.

Fresh out of even half-way decent movies to watch, we thought we'd give The Great Gatsby a try. But not at the first-run theaters. We waited until it appeared at the local cheap theater.

In fact, ""we"" didn't wait for it at all. I went to see it by myself while my wife out of town on business. I didn't want to waste another $3.99 on a ticket for her.

The movie blew me away. It was compelling, emotional, creative, and seemingly very in tune with the spirit of Fitzgerald's book. The ending moved me greatly. I left the theater stunned.

When my wife returned from her business trip, the first thing we did was go see The Great Gatsby.

She was as moved as I was.

We left (me, after seeing it a second time) vowing to buy the Blu-ray the day it comes out.

I doubt we'll ever be big DiCaprio fans. He's just not that good of an actor. But Carey Mulligan is always a treat, and the rest of the cast was decent, too. Even Tobey McGuire, another actor we don't particularly care for.

Yet, all of them together work. The whole movie works. The Luhrmann style captured the craziness of the era without going overboard into a too-busy, too-loud movie.

This version of The Great Gatsby beats the 1974 movie starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. By a long shot. Compared to this version, the Redford/Farrow film looks even more lame. And it was pretty darn lame.

My advice is this: Give it a try. Go see it at a second-run theater. Or buy the movie when it's released. It's a very good film, far more compelling and accessible than Luhrmann usually is, and quite a good yarn.

As for me, I'll buy this Blu-ray version the day its released...and watch it a third time. It really is that good.",1375488000,9,2131,4.367088607594937
4972200,4,B0067EKYS6,"For those who know nothing about The Great Gatsby - never read the book or seen previous screen versions of it - count your blessings for you'll be able to soak all of this up without being bothered by whether it's faithful to Scott Fitzgerald's literary masterpiece or whether it's better or worse than previous attempts at bringing it to the big screen. You will, almost certainly, be knocked out by its fantastic sets, its clever plot and its superb love story because as a stand-alone experience, free of any preconceptions, it's an exciting, gripping and deeply moving movie.

For the less fortunate - those who have expectations of what a screen version of this novel should be - things are much more difficult. For, while this is fundamentally the same story that Fitzgerald wrote it's not what he wrote - key parts of it have been missed out, much of what's been kept in has been exaggerated, and quite a lot of it simply isn't in the book. It's not The Great Gatsby as you want or hoped it would be and much gnashing of teeth will almost certainly follow as you witness scene after scene being twisted or, worse still, added-in for dramatic effect.

In rock music terms what it is is a big production ""cover version"" and, in the end, that's how it should be judged because it's quite clear right from the opening scenes - a sequence that isn't mentioned or referred to anywhere in the book - that Baz Luhrmann has no intention of producing a faithful interpretation of it. What he wants to do is to take Fitzgerald's quite brilliant story and use it as the basis for a fast & furious cinematic ""work-out"" - a huge spectacle, full of CGI graphics, vast sets, swathes of exciting, technically complex audio-visual virtuosity and, on the way, a great deal of genuine drama.

It is in fact The Great Gatsby on steroids - a pumped-up and distorted version of the original - and the really annoying thing for aficionados of this 20th Century classic is that it works, at times quite brilliantly, because like all good cover versions the essence of the original has been retained and then extended out into something that's exhilaratingly different. Just don't expect it to be what it's not.",1375401600,,2193,4.646907216494846
4972201,4,B0067EKYS6,"For what I believe is the 6th attempt to put F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby on the screen, director Baz Luhrmann's adaption brings the novel to life in a novel way. Many will love the razz pizzazz of Baz-Jazz and hate the 1920's soap opera-like scenes. Others will appreciate the reverent tone of Fitzgerald's novel, especially the words narrated by the writer's surrogate, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) and hate the loud, gaudy yet contemporary party scenes. For me the film is balanced pretty well.

Jay Gatsby (terrific Leonardo DiCaprio) is a self-made millionaire, living in semi-seclusion in a huge mansion directly across the bay from Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) in New York's Long Island. While Gatsby is most often alone, he deals with his mysterious businesses by phone. He also throws elaborate parties almost every night. Hundreds of guests come in all their colorful finery and party all night long with bootlegged booze endlessly on tap. Gatsby's next door neighbor is Nick who is renting an old caretaker's cottage. Nick is also a cousin to Daisy.

After Nick and Gatsby become acquainted, a meeting is set-up between Gatsby and an unsuspecting Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby, then an officer about to go to war, met Daisy at her parents Louisville home. They fell in love but the war kept them apart long enough for Daisy to marry Tom, the heir to an industrial fortune. As they say, old money. Tom, a brutish chauvinist is romancing Myrtle (Isla Fisher) on the side. Myrtle is the wife of George (Jason Clarke), the owner of a broken down gas station between Long Island and the city.

In the big party scenes, Luhrmann reminds of his ""Moulin Rouge"" with many shots down from the ceiling, spinning cameras and twirling dancers. ""Gatsby"" has one of the best soundtracks of the year, coordinated by executive producer, Jay-Z. The filmmakers do a great job mixing some older music, mostly Gershwin classics, with modern rock and hip-hop. It all works.

The film falls a bit short of perfection however. And by short I mean long. That is, the film runs nearly 2  hours. This might have been OK if it meant longer or more musical opportunities. Instead, the last act crawls along until the obvious conclusion. Unlike Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 underwhelming version, DiCaprio and Mulligan have a real connection giving their characters a believable portrayal of love lost, found and lost again. I suspect Fitzgerald would have liked this version.

(BLU RAY UPDATE 12/30/13)

I thought the movie seen for the first time was worthy of 4/5 stars, primarily for the production values.  I watched it again, this time on a Blu ray disc that comes in a couple different packages.  I've added 1/2 a star.  Before I get into the Blu ray qualities, allow a supplement to my original review.

The film received mixed reviews at best, some scathing.  While I will admit to Lurhmann devotion to Fitzgerald's novel is shallow, I don't think he was trying to make a dramatic commentary of the illusion of the American Dream.  He was trying to entertain with big sets, big color, big music and an overall big production.  While not a musical in the traditional sense, Lurhmann and his music producers (Craig Armstrong and Shawn ""Jay Z"" Carter) manage to create a stew that portends the era with vintage and modern music beautifully mixed.  You will hear shadings of Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" throughout the film.  The movie opens with Jay Z's 100$ Bill and closes with Armstrong's ""The Green Light"" with properly layered modern songs in between.  The music adds a richness to the film, from intimate moments to the wild parties.

Lurhmann does effectively maintain the love triangle created by Fitzgerald and incorporates his dialog, sometimes with the words floating above the screen (effective in 3D).  My favorites include Nick, after meeting Jordan (Daisy's pro golfer best friend), recollecting ""She frightened me but I enjoyed looking at her."" And Jordan telling Nick about how Daisy met Gatsby in Louisville, ""The way he looked at her was the way all girls want to be looked at.""

I loved the art deco sets, The Jazz Age (Fitzgerald coined term) feel, the exotic clothes and the overall amplification of the time.

As for the Blu ray version.  It is as exotic and spectacular as the film.  Properly transferred in 1080p and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, it looks great.  In an over-the-top production like this the color must pop and it does.  The film is purposely bright and the lighting often provides overly sharp images, especially skin tones.  This should be expected.  The blacks are inky dark.  If you look closely at some of the scenes with night skies, you might see a speck or too but no big deal.  Overall I thought the video was sharp with excellent delineation.

Likewise the audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  Other than wishing it was 7.1, I have no complaints.  Again with the music a major contributor to the movie, it has to resonate.  And it does.  Surrounds are active most of the time, especially in the party sequences.  The subs will get a workout as the Duisenberg's big engine roars.  And some of the more lively songs produce plenty of thump.  Here are the extras, most of which I found fascinating:

4972202,4,B0067EKYS6,"This version of The Great Gatsby has received mixed review and I am in no way surprised.  It's a bit of a dichotomy.  On the one hand we have an original Baz Luhrmann creation.  It has all the flim and flam of his earlier works and my feeling is it worked much better in those.  It fitted brilliantly into the seedy theatre of Moulin Rogue and added fresh stye to the substance of the Bard in Romeo and Juliet but here it left me cold.  It was a forced and obvious intrusion.  It was a pink sequined jacket on a penguin.  So isn't that a disaster?  Doesn't that ruin the whole production?

In a word?  No.  You see, it's all rather bullet proof.  The human drama between the four main players, the strong, clever and earnest performances from its cast, the wonderful language of Fitzgerald, the message, are all there, all intact and no amount of fizz and razzle dazzle can undo the good work.  There may be attempts to batter the driving heart of the production but they all bounce harmlessly away.

I didn't care that the music was incongruous or I could pick out certain visual licks from Luhrmann's earlier work.  I didn't care that there were small changes from the book or that it was told in flashback.  It's not the over-stuffed party that holds your attention, it's the quiet man passing through it.  Luhrmann made a brilliant call; he filled his movie with people who understood their characters and the story better than he did and, in that, he orchestrated a triumph.  I loved the book when I was first 'subjected' to it in highschool English class.  I loved Fitzgerald's way with words and I loved Nick and Jay and it's all here.  Everything I loved about the book is here so what do I care if there are clumsy highlighter marks and notes in the margins?  Fitzgerald's words can all be read, clear as day.

Four stars, not at the least because, for most of the film, it made me care about Daisy Buchanan.",1374883200,5,1917,4.432664756446991
4972203,5,B0067EKYS6,"WOW!!!!  This is not your father's Gatsby.  Or is it?  How does one explain to a high school junior that the Charleston was decadent and that Jazz is not something played in the elevator made with a keyboard?

If one wants to instill a true interest in history, then bring it to life, and this movie does!  Themes are classic because they relate to people across generations.  However, difficulties in culture and language can make even overarching human experiences like lost love seem somehow relevant.  Imagine Grandmother describing how all the boys fought over her, and that she used to be quite a dish!

The Redford classic was immaculate but at the same time lacking in energy and life.  Sure, you can ask anybody over 75 what the Marble House is and what it signifies, but what does this mean to a bored teenager?  However, say Gatsby lives in a Bavarian castle, and now they can relate to his wealth.  Watch Gatsby flash his business card to the police officer to get out of a ticket, and later see the police commissioner illegally drinking alcohol and partying with Gatsby really tells the story of Gatsby's influence and power.

More than anything, this movie emphasizes how COOL Gatsby has become and his parties and the paparazzi, and how HOLLYWOOD and the stars of the sporting world come to his home each week-end.

Now, there are legitimate criticisms that the movie does not explore the deeper themes of the movie more in depth. [in particular, I missed a more in depth examination of the role of women, in particular the missing interaction of Daisy with her daughter and what is a desirable path for a female follow] This is a valid criticism.  However, the purpose of the movie is NOT to be some sort of visual novel, but rather to encourage people to read the literature, explore the deeper symbolism of the book, to breath some life into a nearly century old story, or simply to be entertained.

The updates such as the substitution of substitution of the Duesenberg Model J for the stodgy old RR, and more importantly, the roar and speed at which it was driven help to convey to the audience that this is was the Bugatti one hundred years ago.  Times Square was also made to feel vibrant as it does today on the televised New Year's celebrations.  [how hard is it to make a pale yellow car look ""cool?""]

In summary, I view this movie in much the same way as I would The Marriage of Figaro or Don Giovanni.  No production is ever identical, and there is some magic in that.  Baz has put his brush to a clean canvas and come up with an extraordinary work.  It is not for everybody, but in a world that continues to lack in literary scholarship and ""classic"" has become synonymous with ""out of touch"" or worse ""irrelevant"" an interpretation such as this one can, perhaps, help to bring younger people to the classics by allowing them to be somewhat more accessable. When places and things are more identifiable, it is easier to realize that it does not matter that the Castle is now LeBron's house, and the Duesenberg is now a Bently, but the themes of love, achievement, morality and ultimately the analysis of the self are the same today as they have always been.",1374624000,5,3187,4.585537918871252

This film is made to appeal to a visual generation, and it is full of imagery and symbolism. Every scene can be paused to discuss - why -choices have been made.

4972210,5,B0067EKYS6,"From the moment the film began I was captivated. The cinematography is spectacular with a 3D added bonus (optional)! Crisp, clean and crystal clear, unlike anything I've ever seen on the bigscreen. I mean from the colors to the clothing, the actors, aerial angles, flashing lights and special effects, to the energy and the excitement delivered by the soundtrack and the high speed revving from the roaring engines of the rich were mesmerizing. For me, what this film projected was intensely engaging, ever arousing and fantastical in a sense. So much so that I saw the film in theaters 3 times!

Let me just say, the anticipation leading up to Gatsby's onscreen introduction had me overly anxious. As a huge Robert Redford fan, I wasn't sure if Leonardo DiCaprio would measure up, but boy was I wrong ol' sport! Leo became a man in this film. Exit Jack from The Titanic, enter Gatsby, Jay Gatsby... And woo-hoo, the ladies in the theater go wild!! Needless to say, I was done! Stick a fork in me why don't ya!!! LOL! From that second on, I fell deeper and deeper in love with his character, his story and his passion for love in his lifetime. Face it y'all,  I am hooked for life. Granted, there were 2 songs on the soundtrack that were over the top and unnecessary (H to the Izzo 0 Jay-Z and a remake of Beyonce's Crazy In Love), but they come and go so fast that they become tolerable and easy to ignore. Other than that and the fact that Gatsby dies, I have no room for contention. Matter of fact, I can't wait to buy it on DVD.

In closing, I know for those who saw the original, the modern day twist to the film threw many for a loop. But given the fact that Baz stayed true to the story, the added flair of the 2013 flavor was far from a bust. If anything, Baz's adaptation introduced a younger audience (who may have otherwise lacked interest in the original) to the F. Scott Fitzgerald literary classic. My 15 year old niece also saw the movie 3 times and not with me. She went with her 16 and 17 year old friends who enjoyed it just as much as she did and that says what? It says Baz did something right!

All I ask is that you see the film for yourself, but please watch with an open-mind. If you can't do that then this movie is definitely not for you. Don't watch expecting to see the 1974 Robert and Mia, softly lit, slow and semi-boring version (which don't get me wrong, I liked) 'cause you'll be highly disappointed. Watch, remembering that its 2013, it's a new dawn, it's a new day, it's a new life and I'm feeling good!",1373500800,7,2538,4.3594080338266386

So yeah, rap probably wasn't the music Fitzgerald had in mind for Jay Gatsby's parties, but that doesn't mean that kids in school studying the novel this movie is based on won't find this movie helpful. In fact, it might be more helpful than any movie adaptation made before it, for this reason: it is largely contemporary. I think it sticks to the story quite well. It is only told differently - that is, it doesn't attempt to stiffly adhere to some notion of antiquity. It tells the story in a way people today, and probably especially those the adolescent age of students studying the book in school, will understand. Maybe jazz in the 20's evoked a feeling different from what it evokes now. And so the soundtrack used in the film expresses what the novel means (while still playing along with the Jazz Age theme, entertainingly) - lavish, badass partying, scandalous forbidden love, intense hope, for example - and isn't that what's important?

I think watching this movie will enhance the understanding of anyone who reads the novel.

Otherwise, whether you are studying the novel, reading it for pleasure, or not reading it at all, this is a great movie worth watching. Superb acting, gorgeous costumes for each body that appears, music that makes an impact, and brilliant retelling of a timeless story.

4972212,4,B0067EKYS6,"The Great Gatsby is a novel that has famously failed to cross into other mediums. With this latest adaptation, by director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge!), I was curious to see how Luhrmann's unique style would translate to this classic story. I entered the theater with a fair amount of trepidation, especially after the largely mixed reviews that I'd read. To my surprise, however, I really enjoyed this adaptation.

There were a couple of major alterations to the novel's original story, namely Nick's background and the events that take place after his time with Gatsby, but the film was mostly faithful to the novel. Many of the reviews argued against the director's style over substance approach, but I completely disagree with these claims. While there are moments of dazzling camera acrobatics and 3D effects, there are also many moments of quiet introspection. DiCaprio's Gatsby is probably the most sincere portrayal of this character that will ever appear on film. His interactions with both Maguire's Nick and Mulligan's Daisy seemed genuine, and I could really feel the soul of the man behind the facade he had made for himself.

This unique interpretation will, no doubt, garner a variety of reactions amongst the faithful readers and casual moviegoers. In the end, it is probably impossible to perfectly translate the intentions of the novel into a film, but this one comes pretty close.",1373155200,11,1399,5.104803493449782

Jay Gatsby (terrific Leonardo DiCaprio) is a self-made millionaire, living in semi-seclusion in a huge mansion directly across the bay from Tom (Joel Edgerton) and Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan) in New York's Long Island. While Gatsby is most often alone, he deals with his mysterious businesses by phone. He also throws elaborate parties almost every night. Hundreds of guests come in all their colorful finery and party all night long with bootlegged booze endlessly on tap. Gatsby's next door neighbor is Nick who is renting an old caretaker's cottage. Nick is also a cousin to Daisy.

After Nick and Gatsby become acquainted, a meeting is set-up between Gatsby and an unsuspecting Daisy. Five years earlier Gatsby, then an officer about to go to war, met Daisy at her parents Louisville home. They fell in love but the war kept them apart long enough for Daisy to marry Tom, the heir to an industrial fortune. As they say, old money. Tom, a brutish chauvinist is romancing Myrtle (Isla Fisher) on the side. Myrtle is the wife of George (Jason Clarke), the owner of a broken down gas station between Long Island and the city.

In the big party scenes, Luhrmann reminds of his ""Moulin Rouge"" with many shots down from the ceiling, spinning cameras and twirling dancers. ""Gatsby"" has one of the best soundtracks of the year, coordinated by executive producer, Jay-Z. The filmmakers do a great job mixing some older music, mostly Gershwin classics, with modern rock and hip-hop. It all works.

The film falls a bit short of perfection however. And by short I mean long. That is, the film runs nearly 2  hours. This might have been OK if it meant longer or more musical opportunities. Instead, the last act crawls along until the obvious conclusion. Unlike Robert Redford and Mia Farrow in the 1974 underwhelming version, DiCaprio and Mulligan have a real connection giving their characters a believable portrayal of love lost, found and lost again. I suspect Fitzgerald would have liked this version.

The Blu ray package comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio. In a word it looks spectacular. This transfer is an honest projection of the filmmaker's intent. The film is often very bright, especially when there is a party going on. The colors are intense and the picture is crisp. Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 option is rich with the mixture of genres in the musical score. The surrounds are often in play, especially during the party sequences. Subtitles come in Spanish, Portuguese, French and English SDH. I did not review the 3-D version.  Here is a list of extras:

4972217,4,B0067EKYS6,"I adore Baz Luhrmann and this movie only grew my love for him more. It's funny, I expected this movie to be a lot more fantastical than it was. Usually there is lots of extra silliness in a Luhrmann film(close-ups, sound effects), but this one was toned down. It was more fitting for the novel I guess. A bit disappointing, but still okay.

The reason the movie ranked higher than the book for me is two main reason. First, there was none of that Nick Carraway dithering on bits. Second, When I can see people talking I know who is talking and I don't have to re-read the same chapter ten times to figure out who's talking. Both of those things made me like this movie a lot more.

This seems like an easy book to film adaptation to be able to follow the book. I mean, it only takes a couple of hours to read the book anyways. For the most part the film followed the book nicely. There were a few things that were done differently and some were okay while others I didn't like. When Nick shows up to Gatsby's first party there is a strange guy pulling Jordan away from him the whole time. It seemed to set up a connection between Nick and Jordan that didn't happen again in the film. It was a bit strange but okay.

One thing that drove me a little crazy was the ""Old Sport"" thing. In the film it sounded like ""Old Spore"". Why? Why was DiCaprio pronouncing it like that. It's probably the way that it's supposed to be pronounced, but there is a ""t"" in there! I hate it...I don't care if it's correct I still hate it.

I enjoyed this movie though and if you are looking for a book to film adaptation that works, check this one out.",1372204800,2,1630,4.198083067092652
4972218,4,B0067EKYS6,"Having heard conflicting reports in reviews and through word-of-mouth,
I approached Baz Luhrmann's version of THE GREAT GATSBY with mixed
feelings. In the first half-hour I have to admit that I thought it was
rather over-blown and operatic; the screen was filled with color and
light; many scenes, although brilliantly staged and expertly filmed,
seemed rather irrelevant to the purpose of the story; while the music -
an anachronistic combination of Twenties standards and contemporary
rock - jarred on my ears. As the action unfolds, however, so the film
radically improves as Luhrmann becomes far more interested in his
characters. As Nick Carraway, Tobey Maguire assumes a pivotal role in
the action; he is the first person we see on screen as he recalls what
happened to his psychiatrist. At once appalled yet attracted to Jay
Gatsby's way of life, Nick comes to understand what lies behind it:
Gatsby's perpetual desire for recognition in New York high society.
Carey Mulligan comes across as rather colorless as Daisy Buchanan;
however, in terms of Lurhmann's interpretation, this seems entirely
coherent. Gatsby is prepared to go to any lengths to recreate his love-
affair with Daisy; Lurhmann shows that Daisy is not really worth it. As
Fitzgerald says in the source-text, she is ""careless"" as well as
indifferent. Joel Edgerton's Tom Buchanan is quite simply brilliant;
someone accustomed to a privileged way of life, who possesses little or
no understanding of anyone around him. He believes he can pick up and
throw away people at will, just like material things. Leonardo
DiCaprio's Gatsby bears a striking facial resemblance to the young
Orson Welles. At once confident yet suspicious, his eyes dart around
from person to person, as if unable to trust anyone. His final
confrontation with Tom in the hotel room is quite stunning - especially
when Gatsby loses his civilized veneer and reveals his true nature. At
the film's end we are left feeling terribly sad: Gatsby might have been
a fraud, but as Nick says, he embodies the kind of perpetual hope that
seems quite at odds with the material world around him.",1372118400,,2126,5.042613636363637

Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

 Most of the critical reviews of Baz Luhrmann's new take on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic, 'The Great Gatsby', focus on its over the top production values. Here are a few samples of the type of criticism I am referring to: ""a near-constant bombardment of visual over stimulation,"" ""mostly a cacophony of style, excess and noise that makes you want to turn it all down a notch,"" ""anachronistic convergence of hip-hop and swing,"" ""all look and no feel,"" ""hyper-active cacophony rather than enthralling entertainment,"" ""baroque, overblown, megalomaniacal spectacles,"" (with Luhrmann) ""less a filmmaker than a music-video director with endless resources and a stunning absence of taste.""

Aside from the hip-hop and unnecessary use of 3-D, Luhrmann's penchant for overindulgence didn't really bother me. In fact, one of the titles Fitzgerald came up with before settling on 'Gatsby', was ""Trimalchio in West Egg""--referencing the obnoxious, ancient Roman 'noveau riche' businessman in Petronius' 'Satyricon', known for his wild orgy-like feasts. I'm not sure at all whether Fitzgerald would have actually objected to all those over-the-top, gaudy spectacles, Luhrmann proffers up here in his take on the 1920s 'jazz age'.

Getting back to the critical reviews, only Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times actually has the temerity to suggest that Fitzgerald's source material is no masterpiece: ""Though it is gorgeously written and often cited as one of the great American novels, Fitzgerald's ""Gatsby"" is in fact very much a slender reed, a tragedy in a minor key."" I would go further and argue that Fitzgerald's main character is not fleshed out at all and woefully unconvincing. Hence, no matter how Luhrmann 'jazzes' up 'Gatsby' (whether successful or not), Fitzgerald's source material will leave any film director handicapped from the get-go, in attempting to successfully adapt the novel from page to screen.

The Gatsby slow-moving introduction appears intentional, as the mystery behind the elusive tycoon, is built up. Again, the gaudy production values (the costumes, the old cars, the set designs) are enough to keep one settled, until the story really begins to pick up. One notes that Nick Carraway, an ordinary 'Joe', plays the part of the protagonist's only true ally. Carraway, the film's narrator, appears to be a stand in for Fitzgerald himself.

Perhaps the best scene in the film is when Gatsby is introduced to Carraway, his social inferior, and then takes him on a tour of 'his world' the next day, setting out in his Yellow Duesenberg (let's not be too upset that this is a 1929 Duesenberg, and the scene takes place in 1922!). Gatsby of course has an ulterior motive: he hopes that Carraway, will help him reunite with his long-lost love, Daisy Buchanan, who happens to be Carraway's cousin!

The problem with all this is Gatsby's character. Can you really believe any of it? It's obvious that Fitzgerald, through Carraway, creates an idealized picture of a ruthless gangster, who just happens to go goo-goo eyes over a woman he fell for, five years earlier, before his 'trial by fire', as a confirmed bootlegger . You would think a gangster like Gatsby would have modeled himself on a realistic character like Tony Soprano, who never had any compunctions about going from one woman to another, disposing of them at his whim, in rapid succession. But no, Gatsby is such a noble, mushy guy, that he pines for Daisy (a complete airhead who we learn nothing about) and will even take the heat, when Daisy is on the hook for vehicular manslaughter (at film's end).

Another convenient strategy is for Fitzgerald (again through Carraway's perspective), to ignore Gatsby's dark side by failing to show us any of Gatsby's malevolent behaviors in the bootlegger's world, which allowed him to accumulate all his money, and rise to the top. What's more, Tom Buchannan, the antagonist we must compare to the 'noble' Gatsby, is a flat-out cartoon racist who is constantly mouthing pronouncements about how the white race continually faces annihilation by 'darker peoples.'

Fitzgerald wants us to feel bad about Gatsby when Carraway informs us that no one who attended his extravagant parties, shows up for his funeral. Why in fact should we feel sorry for Gatsby? If in fact, he resembled a fleshed out, real person, then I could have easily felt some sympathy. But the truth of the matter is that Gatsby exists only in F. Scott Fitzgerald's imagination. There is no attempt to create a real-life person here and isn't that what 'art' should be about?

For those who say 'Gatsby' is purely a fable, I say a good fable should reflect 'reality'. Despite being a master of descriptive phraseology, Fitzgerald's characters are the stuff of cheap melodrama: a 'softy' sociopath with a heart of gold. Don't feel sorry for Gatsby as Nick Carraway does at film's end--and don't put him on pedestal. Break out some of your old Soprano DVDs--if you want a true portrait, of a REAL gangster!",1371945600,,5056,5.0503597122302155
4972220,5,B0067EKYS6,"I've seen Baz Lurhmann's The Great Gatsby five times (so far). The sets, costumes and cars are brilliant; the pace is dizzying; the excess is intoxicating; and the overall visual thrill is exhilarating. This film has moved me emotionally in ways that amaze me. It fills me with hope and it makes me sad. At times, it brought me to tears.

The hope comes from Lurhmann's portrayal of Gatsby's vision: Gatsby sees himself as a son of God, who has unique purpose in this life, despite being born into poverty, and he's determined to live that purpose and his life to the fullest. Gatsby shoots for the stars and lands among them knowing nothing can stop him, aside from himself.

The sadness comes from that fact that Gatsby does destroy himself. He shifts his eyes away from growing fully into being the person he is destined to be and allows his eyes to become intoxicated with Daisy Buchanan. He then becomes obsessed with having the one thing in life he cannot possess: Daisy. And this is the beginning of the end for Gatsby. I also resonated with the great sadness of Daisy when she lamented the loss of all of the precious, beautiful things in life that fade away so quickly and never return, like youth and love.

I've never been a great Leonardo DiCaprio fan, but he shines brilliantly through an amazing portrayal of Gatsby. He's the perfect Jay Gatsby. I can't imagine any other contemporary actor playing this role so well. And in my mind, Robert Redford's Gatsby fades to gray against DiCaprio's Gatsby. I believe DiCaprio's Gatsby will become the gold standard. All past and future portrayals of Jay Gatsby will be compared to DiCaprio's--and they'll all come up short.

The rest of the cast was also amazing. In particular, Tobey Maguire, who has the weight of the movie on his shoulders as Nick Carraway, is really magnificent in portraying the innocence, vulnerability and honesty of his character.

If it were up to me Gatsby would sweep every awards ceremony. I can't wait for the DVD release! This is THE masterpiece of 2013.",1371859200,,2041,4.72191011235955
4972221,5,B0067EKYS6,"Saw this in 3D and thought it was absolutely fantastic. Full of contrasts -- rich/poor, black/white, and of course, gay/tragic. Wonderful, vivid and colourful presentation of the Jazz Age in this brilliant dramatic tale of a once ""poor"" man still trying to realize the American dream. The party scenes/music/costumes et al were spectacular! Not American so not exactly sure what the American dream is (rising from poverty to great wealth and fame?!) but was completely engrossed in the visuals as well as the story and acting. Read the book many, many years ago and this was a nice way to relive Fitzgerald's finest work. Have in the past seen DiCaprio in several films but I think he outdid himself here. There were moments when he reminded me of Marlon Brando, that's how good I think his performance was. Impressed with almost everything about this film -- only thing that I found very odd is when Gatsby visited Carraway's house for an ""accidental"" meeting with Daisy, gets wet in the rain and comes in with dripping hair and clothes but a moment later, his clothes all appear dry!",1371427200,2,1085,4.807486631016043
4972222,4,B0067EKYS6,"Saw The Great Gatsby and find myself profoundly affected by it. It's been 18 years since I've read Gatsby and while its themes of ""the American dream,"" excess, classism, and societal conventions are intact in Baz Luhrmann's adaptation, it also left with a great emptiness. It is as if I've watched a beautiful watercolor being painted before my eyes. At times vibrant, frenetic and bombastic, often slowing to perfect the intricacies. Then a sudden deluge washes the beauty away, as colors are mottled to grays and browns, streaking the canvas and blurring a picture that was more illusion than reality. In so doing, I've taken the journey of Jay Gatsby and Nick Carraway- impermanence, futility, hope, beauty, and the impossibility of redemption. Time marches ever forward and our beacons are ever beyond our grasp, not because of time or distance, merely because the beacon isn't what we imagine it to be.",1371168000,2,907,5.013245033112582
4972223,5,B0067EKYS6,"The thing about Great Gatsby is that it surprised me from the very get go. The story is being narrated by a gentleman played by Toby Maguire. He is refreshing, earnest and his voice over the sequences seems to have a transient effect. The movie begins with him talking about Gatsby, there are many sets in the film and the 3D is certainly rewarding. I found that despite the limited storyline the film is poised very well, the sets are fabulous, the acting is consistently good, the humor is good, while the music is great.

I have not liked a Leonardo Di Caprio film since The Departed. He does these agonizing roles just to prove a point to himself but he is perfectly suited to do a role such as Gatsby.

I haven't seen this good a film since i saw the place beyond the pines earlier this year. This is tied for the film of the year spot with that film.

Strengths are great acting, wonderful sets, very fast paced and intriguing direction, gripping storytelling and an overall feeling of sufficient intrigue and euphoria.

4972224,2,B0067EKYS6,"Based on the classic novel, this is the story of a friendship that develops between J. Gatsby and his neighbor. Gatsby is a mysterious figure known for lavish parties and a significant life story. This effort by director Baz Luhrmann is heavy on the visuals while being light on the storytelling, and the drama. The movie is like a birthday gift that is wrapped beautifully, but when opened, nothing much is there. It certainly looks extravagant, but the film is too long, and it does not do justice to one of the great American stories ever told.",1370822400,2,547,4.649484536082475
4972225,3,B0067EKYS6,"To date there have been a number of movie adaptations of Gatsby, the 1974 version starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow, being my favourite; so when I heard Gatsby was about to get the Baz Luhrmann treatment, I wasn't quite sure what to think. See, like the decidedly mixed reviews on this film, I share similar feelings about Luhrmann's movies in general. While I adored his modernised interpretation of Romeo + Juliet, I could barely make it through Moulin Rouge. Seeing Gatsby was a gamble for me because while there's no doublt Luhrmann has a monopoly on contemporary flare and visual excess, he also has a tendency to skim the surface, missing much of the underlying detail. So what was the end result?

His Gatsby fell somewhere in between the two.

It's hard to know where to start because my thoughts on this movie are all over the place. Though I did enjoy the theatrical experience in a visual sense, emotionally it was incredibly unfulfilling. Not exactly what you expect or want from an adaptation of one of the most hailed novels, like, ever. So yeah. But honestly, was I surprised by this? Not really. It ended up being exactly what I thought it might be: visually striking but lacking in depth and character. It all boils down to way too much focus placed on the aesthetic parts and not enough on the ""meat and potatoes"" of the film. Sure, there are brief sparks of something special, but overall, it lacked a lot of the heart and soul that comes from the original source material.

Luhrmann's Gatsby is imposing, in-your-face and brash which works both for and against it. This forwardness has a tendency to highlight the obvious making it lack the subtlety that makes earlier versions of the movie so much more effective. For instance, you're beaten in the face with the symbolism of the green light so much so that it feels like you're being insulted. Look Baz, the green light is important, I know, but we're not all that dense, okay? There's something to be said for leaving an air of mystery, of which this movie did none of. However, that being said, I do think he excels in creating striking cinematography which keeps you riveted to the screen. He makes you not want to look away because his world stands out from all the rest. The opulence of this movie matches the excess of the Roaring 20's to near perfection and it sets the stage well while enhancing the mood. I also really liked Luhrmann's use of contemporary music when contrasted against the vintage-inspired glitz and glamour. I know this isn't something that will please everyone, but it worked for me. It's Luhrmann's trademark and he does it well.

That being said, good visuals aren't enough to carry a movie. I think my biggest issue was the lack of personality. Don't get me wrong, the setting had plenty of it but where it mattered, it had little to none. There was very little natural chemistry between Leo DiCaprio's Gatsby and Carey Mulligan's Daisy. They were solid individually, but not when they were together. I mean, this is the key relationship in the movie and it didn't feel real. And if I'm being real here, I wasn't vibing on Leo's take of Gatsby at all. He was too disingenuous and self-serving for my liking. If you ask me, Robert Redford pretty much has the monopoly on the multi-faceted character. He was self conscious and refined in all the right places. Leo's angry, angsty Gatsby was fitting only in bits and pieces. What I did enjoy, though, was Mulligan's Daisy. She brings a stronger, more defiant side to Daisy's otherwise flighty, dainty damsel-in-distress act. It's a refreshing twist on the character, for sure.

Another thing I noticed (and not in a good way) was how the story was told. More often than not, Nick Carraway's (Tobey Maguire) narrative was mistimed and misplaced, frequently jarring me out of the story. It made every second of the 2hr 23min running time seem that much longer. So that on top of the characters not feeling true to the characters in the book, it was hard to foster a connection to anyone of them --- and in a story that ends so tragically, you want to, no, need to be moved. I, on the other hand, couldn't care less. Baz Luhrmann's Gatsby, unfortunately, was a swing and a miss It's not that the movie is terrible, it's actually pretty enjoyable if you can take it at face value. It's got jazz in all the right places, if you know what I mean. I just happen to like prior versions better, that's all.

And on a side note: I still think Baz Luhrmann's interpretation of Romeo + Juliet was the pinnacle of his directing career so he's definitely got that going for him because that movie is AMAZING.

Food for Thought: While Baz Luhrmann's signature flare worked in tandem with the rich excessiveness of the decade, his version of The Great Gatsby missed the mark in just about every other way. There were strong performances by each of the characters individually but when together, they lacked chemistry. I found caring more about the way the film looked than I did any of its characters which defeats the purpose of translating such a deep and meaningful story to the screen. This movie is all about face value in a world where there's so much more beneath the surface.",1370476800,,5222,4.645021645021645
4972226,4,B0067EKYS6,"If you've watched Redford's performance as Jay Gatsby you know going into this movie that Leonardo DiCaprio has a lot to live up to in this role. I enjoyed the version with Redford in it. And I enjoyed Moulin Rouge! So a Baz Lurhrman version of the story sounded like something that would remake the mold of Hollywood's Gatsby.

First off : This is no Moulin Rouge! There is flash and bling and lovely posed shots and beautiful setting and velvet and gold but the over the top luxuriant performances from Moulin Rouge are nowhere to be seen. Even the frantic pseudo flapper parties are nowhere near the madness of Moulin in celebration. The soundtrack is nowhere near the brilliance of Moulin either and makes an appearance too far in between.

But this isn't meant to be Moulin Rouge and you figure that very quickly. The story does not stray too far from the original but the performances from the actors are really exceptional. The leading pair are absolutely wonderful in their interpretation of Daisy Buchanan and Jay Gatsby. DiCaprio manages to be vulnerable and slightly dangerous without the aloof, slightly snooty, persona that Redford infused the character with. DiCaprio is much more believable as the Gatsby of the book. Carey Mulligan's Daisy too is a much more nuanced character in this movie than Mia Farrow's constantly frenetic, slightly unbalanced performance. If anyone appears to be mildly unbalanced here, it is Gatsby with his brave and unrealistic dreams that eerily border on obsession. A scene that stood out in this movie as a definite improvement over Coppola's version was the shirt throwing scene where Farrow comes across as just plain cuckoo whereas Mulligan is a woman in mourning for what might have been.

The movie does fall flat in the choice of Tobey Maguire as the narrator and witness to all the madness. Sam Waterston's performance as the outsider observer was much better than the nave young fool that Maguire plays that seems to have not an ounce of wit or drive behind him. Waterston was able to portray the contempt he felt for Daisy and her sort while Maguire wallows in depression and misery. The whole idea of having Nick go off the deep end and end up in a Sanitarium is  bit morose and over the top.

So, there are some gaps to this movie but the leading stars give solid performances. To fans of Gatsby this movie will not be perfect but, frankly, with the star power and the beautiful filming, it would be wonderful if this movie drew a newer generation to the world of Fitzgerald and Gatsby and Daisy and Nick Carraway.",1370217600,,2571,4.742729306487695
4972227,3,B0067EKYS6,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

Where to start, where to start. There are many words I can use to describe The Great Gatsby and none of them are positive. It took less than four minutes for this film to turn me off and inform me, ""Yup, everything you feared is true. You wanna walk out now and save yourself the time?"" To be completely honest I should have because The Great Gatsby felt like two and a half hours of torture. They took everything this film could, and should, have been and tossed it out the window. Instead of attempting to make a film that would go down in history as a classic, they went the easy route and set their sights on the teenage audience. Not only is this film disrespectful to F. Scott Fitzgerald, but it does a great disservice to the source material.

I should note that I was never particularly fond of The Great Gatsby to begin with. I thought the story itself was enjoyable enough, but Fitzgerald's writing style was very... odd. Plus, I always felt that the novel just wasn't good from a literary standpoint. However, I thought that, if done right, it would make for a great piece of film. Which was why I was so excited when this movie was first announced. My excitement was only enhanced when I found out that you had DiCaprio playing Gatsby and Maguire playing Nick, what could go wrong? Apparently a lot could go wrong because somewhere along the line someone suggested ""let's modernize it"" and the end result was disastrous.

For those unfamiliar with the story you have man named Nick Carraway, the narrator, who lives next door to a very wealthy man by the name of Jay Gatsby. Now Gatsby is sort of an enigma. No one really knows who he is or where he came from so, of course, people start making up rumors about him. Gatsby frequently throws huge, extravagant parties at his mansion. No one ever receives an invitation and only a handful of people actually know what he looks like. We later learn that all of this is done in the hopes that Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan), a woman from his past and Nick's cousin, would show up one day. The problem is that Daisy is a married woman now, but it's obvious that there's still that connection between the two of them. He loves her and she loves him, but she also loves her husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton). In the end what you're given is a story filled with secrets, death, and the consequences of one man's love for a woman.

The one and only thing this movie does well is the fact that they basically took the book page by page and transferred it into a film. Majority of the time film adaptions leave stuff out or they change big events, but they did a very good job at sticking to the source material. I only noticed a few minor differences with the first being that the story is told by Nick to a therapist. I don't remember that being part of the novel, but I think this was done just to give the story some sort of context. Then they had Gatsby overuse the phrase ""Old sport"". It was a common phrase of his, but he didn't say it in almost every single sentence. It got a little annoying after a while. Oh, and it seemed as if they downplayed Jordan Baker's (Elizabeth Debicki) role. She just didn't feel as important as she did in the book. Keep in mind that none of these were major gripes, just observations. As we were leaving the theater I overheard a woman say ""They were really accurate with the story."" Which is absolutely true. It's almost insane how accurate they were with everything, but accuracy doesn't mean a damn thing if everything else in the movie is done wrong and, unfortunately, everything else is very wrong.

As odd as it sounds the person I blame the most is Jay-Z. From the moment it was announced that he was chosen to ""compose"" the film's soundtrack I knew it was doomed. Having Jay-Z in charge of a movie's soundtrack just screams ""modernization"" and I was right. My biggest issue with The Great Gatsby is the music that fills the scenes. Answer me this: why in the hell would you have a bunch of modern music in a movie set in the 1920's? It's almost hilarious how big this man's ego is. Not only did he screw up the soundtrack by not including music from that time period, but he put four of his own songs in the film. Not one, not two, four. Why? WHY?!? From a music standpoint the Hip Hop we know today (rhyming over beats) didn't get created until the 70's. So why would you do that? What purpose did it serve other than to boost your own ego? Oh, and trust me, it's not just music that's played over the scenes for the viewers to hear. The music is actually in the scenes. During one of Gatsby's parties when Nick and Jordan are in the library and they meet the man who looks like an owl, you can hear the bass thumping from outside the room like they're at a high school party. I wanted to scream and chuck my drink at the screen. All this film needed was someone to compose a powerful score. That's it. It didn't need all that flair and it definitely didn't need music from artists that weren't even thought of yet.

Unfortunately Jay-Z isn't the only thing wrong with this film. Almost everything that had to do with the technical side of film making is beyond terrible. During the parts where Nick was narrating what's going on you see words flying across the screen because he's typing this story on a type writer. Not only is this effect overdone in the film industry, it takes the viewer out of the experience because it's overdone in the film itself. There's a section towards the end of the movie where the screen is literally filled with letters and words. It reached a point where it stopped serving an artistic purpose and they were doing it just to do it. Then the amount of green screen they used was almost hilarious. Almost every single piece of scenery is fake. What's worse is that the scenes that use the green screen aren't even believable because they don't look real. Just like the letters flying across the screen, the green screen is overdone as well. The only thing the green screen accomplished was making it difficult for the viewer to appreciate the physical sets that were used because by that point it's hard to care. Once again all this does is take the viewer out of the experience.

The film excels when it acts as a film and nothing more. When there's actors doing a scene, reciting the script, and making the novel come alive. A great example would be when Gatsby first brings Daisy to his house. When he's showing her around and DeCaprio, Maguire, and Mulligan are just acting. It's a wonderful thing to watch because it's what it needs to be. It's simple and it's engaging. There's a fine line between making the scenes grand and explosive and making them over the top and annoying. I truly believe that Baz Luhrmann doesn't comprehend the difference. There's just so much wrong with this film's execution that it almost hurt me to watch it.

It may have been a bit of an exaggeration when I said the only thing good about the film was the fact that they stuck to the source material. That isn't entirely true. The cast in here was, surprisingly, great. I never pictured DiCaprio as Gatsby or Debicki as Jordan, but it would be wrong to deny that they both gave great performances. DiCaprio is DiCaprio so you can't really go wrong with him and Maguire gave a solid performance as Nick. Nothing spectacular, but he served his purpose. Out of everyone involved I think Carey Mulligan and Joel Edgerton were the best choices for their respective roles. They're how I envisioned the characters while reading the novel and they both delivered fantastic performances.

Overall Score: 5/10 - It's almost depressing how much of a disappointment this was. The film's final 30 minutes are what I expected the entire movie to feel like; powerful and moving, but that's not what I was given. Any enjoyment that can been found in The Great Gatsby is buried beneath the god awful music and the overdone special effects. Baz Luhrmann was perhaps too ambitious in what he set out to do here and the film is ultimately ruined because of it. There's no doubt in my mind that there's going to be a young audience who finds this fascinating, but for those with a more developed mind this is nothing more than a movie that will soon be forgotten. A faint memory of what could have been. I can't say I will ever watch this again so see this at your own risk.",1370131200,3,8420,4.462337662337663
4972228,4,B0067EKYS6,"I enjoyed this remake.  It was very close to the 1974 version that Robert Redford did, but a bit more grandeous and colorful.  If you are not familiar with the story, it is basically a love story, with sinister dealings and deceit interwoven.  There is also the concept of how the filthy rich just play with people,to achieve their own desires, without even a second thought.  It is also a sad story, in that respect, as you will see when you watch it.

The movie begins at Perkins Sanitarium, where Nick Carraway is talking to his doctor about Gatsby (DiCaprio) as he watches the fluffy white snow twirl in the air.  The doctor suggests that Nick (Toby McQuire) write about Gatsby, to get it out and make himself feel better.  Nick is obviously distraught about losing his friend, and some other realizations he has had.

Flash back to the summer of 1922.  The stock market is soaring up and liquor is flowing. Nick rents a small house on Long Island in the middle of the filthy rich, where he can have a peaceful vacation.  Turns out he is right next to Gatsby, and they get to be good friends, ""Old Sport"".

Nick's cousin Daisy is married to filthy rich Tom Buchanan, and the marriage is not exactly lovey-dovey.  Daisy also knows Gatsby from a long time ago.

Gatsby went from dirt poor to filthy rich within a year or so and nobody knows anything about him or where the money comes from.  Most folks have never even met him.  He seems to have some strange friends and a lot of secret phone calls.  Everbody has a story about Gatsby though, and everybody attends his lavish weekend parties.  They are extravagently unbelievable.  The house is a mansion equivalent to a castle.  The movie combines CGI nicely with real actors and real scenery.

4972229,5,B0067EKYS6,"I eagerly waited for this movie to come out and it did not disappoint me at all. I watched it with the expectation that it would be mildly entertaining and fluffy. Instead it had me in tears the last half of the movie hoping events would change.  I recently reread the book and Leonardo DiCaprio played Gatsby perfectly. The attention to the little details really made it a beautifully tragic story that i could watch many times and not get tired of it.

I've seen the movie twice and love the many layers beneath the glitz and glamor of the larger than life parties that Gatsby throws. Even though i knew what would happen with Daisy and Gatsby, the way the events played out was both heartbreaking and fascinating to watch. It reminded me of watching an accident knowing what will happen yet being unable to change events set in motion long before the final tragedy even occurs.

Seeing the story from Nick's POV really showed that beneath all that glamor there was a dark side to living the fast life. I was initially skeptical about the music but it was blended perfectly in the party and dramatic scenes, it did not feel out of place at all. I've been listening to the soundtrack non-stop this past month. I could go on forever but in short...this movie is so unique and reminds me of Moulin Rouge in some respects.

4972230,4,B0067EKYS6,"May 10th, 2013 marked the highly anticipated release of Baz Luhrmann's The Great Gatsby. This film marks the fourth time F. Scott Fitzgerald's glitzy classic has seen the big-screen treatment. It seems that in an almost poetic piece of truth, filmmakers have been reaching for their own `elusive green light' in that no one has been able to cinematically capture the full power and prestige of the classic novel. It's unusual for a book to be adapted to film every 25 years or so, but that is precisely what has happened. Alan Ladd played the mysterious Jay Gatsby in 1949, Robert Redford in 1974, Toby Stephens in the deplorable A&E TV movie in 2000, and now Leonardo Dicaprio steps into that legendary yellow car's driver's seat. Is the fourth time a charm?

It's the roaring 20s in America and in the midst of America's strongest economic boom in history, Nick Caraway (Toby Maguire) puts his writing career on hold and leaves the Midwest for the magic of New York as a bond salesman. Caraway becomes fascinated with his mysterious neighbor (Gatsby) as rumors about the man and his wealth circulate all around him. Nick is drawn into Gatsby's lavish world and through him, the audience is presented Fitzgerald's cautionary fable of excess, greed, and moral decay that lies beneath the surface of social luxury.

Fourth time a charm? The answer to this question is a complex one. The appeal to this film rests in the impeccable casting of Dicaprio as Gatsby and the choice of such a distinctive director in Luhrmann. Luhrmann and Dicaprio have, of course, successfully updated a classic once before with 1996's Romeo + Juliet. While The People's Critic was not that impressed with that film, it can be admired for its style and individuality. The Great Gatsby does not disappoint in terms of its style, which is no surprise given Luhrmann's reputation.

The film chooses to introduce Caraway slightly differently from the novel, and in that commits its first mistake. The tone of the film is altered right from the start, and Caraway's character is strangely identified as a flawed and beaten down man; he is introduced as a man clinging to sanity. Fans of the book will also be incredibly disappointed in some glaringly missing elements from the film's final act. These changes result in a sacrifice of some major complexities within a major character's past. Nonetheless, the middle section of the film is faithful to the novel and develops very well.

The cast is rounded out nicely with Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan and Joel Edgerton as her husband Tom. Isla Fisher plays Tom's mistress Myrtle and newcomer Elizabeth Debicki plays the vapid vamp, Jordan Baker. Luhrmann is guilty of rushing the pace a bit too much when it comes to developing these characters, but this is likely because he knows the story swings on the hinge of Gatsby and Caraway's relationship. Unfortunately the pacing does affect the film's effectiveness. This and some astonishingly poor editing reduces the film's overall impact. Consequently, Maguire effectively sets up awe and majesty for the appearance of Dicaprio, although the anticipated reveal of his character is not quite as satisfying as it should be.

The Great Gatsby is a story of mood. A successful adaptation must transcend regurgitation of plotpoints and allow the viewer to feel and experience the raw nature of desire and time's fleeting nature. It is here that Luhrmann does succeed. The major victory for this film is in its capturing of the essence of the novel, the time, and the message. Bold choices from contemporary music, effective use of slow motion, and inventive camera placement make the movie exciting and at times, well...Great. I do, however, question the decision for executive producer Jay-Z to use four songs by himself or Beyonce in a film that so urgently attacks bravado, audacity, and arrogance. The Great Gatsby is the best adaptation of Fitzgerald's material, and Dicaprio adds another iconic role to his ever impressive career. While the film is not perfect and will certainly provide some disappointments for fans of the book, the film does stand on its own as a determined, flashy, show-piece of entertainment.

4972232,4,B0067EKYS6,"I have not read the novel THE GREAT GATSBY, nor have I seen other film versions.  To be honest, the little I knew about it didn't grab my attention enough to seek it out.  But when the most recent version was released, I thought it was time to broaden my horizons just a little.  I'll admit, seeing a film version is not a good substitute for reading the original...but there you go.  I haven't read it.  After seeing the film, it's more likely that I might read it, because I felt a number of questions were left unanswered by the film.  (I'll bet the book does the same, but somehow, it's easier to fill in blanks for oneself with a book.)

Anyway, I came into the film with few expectations about the plot.  Essentially, you've got a narrator (Tobey Maguire as Nick) who moves into a small house next to the glittering party palace that belongs to the legendary and little-known Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio).  Nick gets to know Gatsby a little bit, and the two become fairly constant companions.  Nick is enlisted to help achieve Jay's goal of winning back the heart of the girl he has loved for years, Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan).  He was once romantically involved with her, but war and money separated them.  Now Jay has money and he wants to spend it on his love.  Unfortunately, she's married to the reprehensible Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton) and thus Daisy and Jay's road to togetherness does not run smooth.  Not at all.

I don't know what all F. Scott Fitzgerald was trying to say about the times he lived in with his novel, but Baz Luhrmann's glitzy, noisy extravaganza seems to be commenting on wealth.  Yes, there's the idea that money can't buy happiness.  Or that we're destroying ourselves in a relentless pursuit of wealth.  I'd say the film also implies that we've become a society that has a self-imposed class system...where the ""poor boy"" can't get the ""rich girl"" unless he's got the money.  And in America, if one properly applies oneself, the poor boy can become rich enough for the girl to ""love"" him.  Yet love is now a possession, not a feeling.  Tom Buchanan doesn't really ""love"" Daisy in the romantic way we think of love...but he sure feels he owns her.  Jay may love Daisy, but he can only manifest this by showering her with ""stuff""...and Daisy seems delighted and moved by the material goods.

This is a fairly long movie, which is normally just fine with me if the movie is good.  But these people are so unlikeable that I grew tired of spending time with them.  It's tough to root for Jay & Daisy when so much of their passion is materially motivated.  This is perhaps an accurate and even scathing commentary to make on the nature of love in a deeply materialistic world...but it certainly makes it hard to get behind our central couple.  And Luhrmann spends much of his film exposing the viewer to the most shimmering and over-the-top parties and wealth consumption...it's admirable from a design standpoint, but it becomes almost numbing.  (We saw it in 3D...this was not really needed for this film.  The 3D was well done, but it didn't enhance the story for me.)

Luhrmann also made the choice to collaborate with modern artists on the music and songs.  This was, in my opinion, a mistake.  Many of the songs selected were true classics of the period.  They are quite lively and exciting on their own.  Yet when a clearly hip-hop or rock influenced number comes on, it's very jarring.  This isn't A KNIGHT'S TALE, where part of the conceit is having rock music in a medieval story.  Luhrmann wants to have things both ways:  a detailed period piece, but modern sensibilities.  It is distracting.  No doubt it helped album sales...but it ticked me off as a filmgoer.

The best parts of the film are in the performances.  DiCaprio is pretty terrific as Jay, and while it's tough to actually LIKE this guy, DiCaprio fills his character with many shadings and secrets.  Gatsby is a bit of an enigma (and we don't know his entire story until late in the game), but DiCaprio makes him a compelling even charismatic presence.  Certainly the film demands a top-notch Gatsby, or there'd be no hope for it.  DiCaprio delivers once again, and makes the film worth seeing.  This is a 2.5 star film that I'm moving up to 3.5 stars just for this performance.  And I will further round it up to 4 stars (it's still 3.5 really but I can't pick that) because of Joel Edgerton.  His Tom Buchanan is a monster at times, but when he goes toe-to-toe with DiCaprio, he actually manages to win grudging respect from the audience.  He sees right through their romance and calls it for what it is.

Carey Mulligan is a charming actress, but Daisy isn't a very fleshed out character.  In this case, I'd say the script betrays her a bit.  I still like her a lot, but THE GREAT GATSBY does nothing to move her down the road to real stardom.  And the role of Nick is problematic.  He's our narrator and guide, and unlike others, I didn't mind the idea of literally having some narration to help set the stage.  But Maguire gives a wan performance.  He's got a hang-dog look already, but he accompanies his appearance of being a milquetoast with a performance to match.  Nick is a fairly passive character, the man on the sidelines observing it all.  Yet he's onscreen so much that we need him to be more dynamic.  Maguire was simply a poor casting choice from the start.

All-in-all, I'm glad I saw the film.  It has some moments of great visual spark.  It's an interesting story, and features a couple of top-notch performances.  But it is a bit too in love with itself, and Luhrmann's tendencies towards excess (I truly did not like MOULIN ROUGE) allows the film to run long enough that we become actively annoyed at these unlikeable characters.  It's unlikely I would ever see it again...but I do recommend that teen & adult audiences at least give it a look see (sans 3D).",1369785600,,5895,4.576481835564054
4972233,4,B0067EKYS6,"My only concern going into this movie was my memory of what Baz Luhrmann did to Romeo & Juliet.

Overall, my fears were quelled after seeing the movie..

Luhrmann did a very good job capturing the spirit and tone of this novel.  This film did well in making a visualization of the wildness and sensuality of Gatsby's parties. DiCaprio was well cast as Gatsby and capably portrayed the desperation of Gatsby in his lifelong quest to obtain Daisy.  Tobey Maguire did a good job as Nick, giving us the story as he claims that he feels he ""watches from both within and without"" of the group around him.

Carey Milligan was possibly the second best portrayal of Daisy that I've seen (behind Mira Sorvino).  While Milligan did a better job of portraying Daisy's unhappiness with her own marriage, Sorvino did a better job throughout of portraying Daisy as the self-centered person that she is, happy with her life until Gatsby re-appears and challenges what she has.

The one real complaint that I had with the movie was the music.  It was, especially during the party scenes, very anachronistic. Modern hip-hop songs playing was completely out of place in the 1920s jazz-age.  This largely faded in the second half of the film once Gatsby ceased having his parties and began spending every moment with Daisy.

Overall, the film did a very good job of telling the story from the novel and stuck very close to the Fitzgerald's work.

Leonardo diCaprio is fabulous, as usual, and captures just right the cadence of speech and desperate fakery of the title character. Toby Maguire, what an inspired casting decision to have him play the narrator and third wheel, Nick Carraway! And Joel Edgerton, wow, I never knew he was such a great actor. He's been stuck for too long playing these action hero parts. Edgerton's subtle facial features were enough to communicate volumes. And then there is Carey Mulligan, perhaps not as inspired of a casting choice, but at least she isn't the neurotic and screeching Mia Farrow. Soft and sweet, but also useless and money-grubbing, Mulligan's version of Daisy Buchanan was still lovely and lovable enough to make one believe that a social climbing lying psychopath like Jay Gatsbay would fall for her, unlike the insane poodle that was Mia Farrow's version.

4972236,4,B0067EKYS6,"Like the tragic characters and stories that light up the screen and wrench up our hearts, The Great Gatsby 2013 film adaptation is almost more devastating for how great it could have been. Baz Luhrmann's film is a very, very good one. But it is not great.

The performances are excellent. Reviews have been somewhat mixed on Leonardo DiCaprio, but I think he gives us a perfect Gatsby, who pairs beautifully with the always-exceptional Carey Mulligan as Daisy Buchanan, rounded out by the superb Tobey Maguire, in one of his first noteworthy roles in years.

Luhrmann has achieved something few film adaptations of classic literature have; he has taken a work, the F. Scott Fitzergerald novel, which is of course rich with symbolism and meaning, and maintained all these complex themes that your high school English teacher beat into you, without feeling remotely forced or condescending. He allows the audience to reach their own conclusions, both about the characters (particularly Gatsby and Daisy, whom polarize audiences in both their novel and film representations) as well as the iconic symbolism (THE GREEN LIGHT, T.J. Eckleberg).

This is where The Great Gatsby succeeds the most; when taking the source material at its most shallow surface, the story could be represented just as carelessly and giddy as the characters pretend to be. Yet, behind every line and every action, there is an air of tragedy, and Luhrmann knows how to bring that out to great effect.

Luhrmann also does what he usually does best, through the noticeably anachronistic soundtrack. The setting may look like the 1920s, but it sure doesn't sound like it, with an urban soundscape rich with beats by Jay-Z and a haunting love theme by Lana Del Rey.

While Luhrmann employs many of his old tricks, they do not feel as over-the-top or cinematically overwhelming as they could be taken in other films. I love Moulin Rouge with all my heart, but the fast editing and goofy humor could understandably turn some audiences off; The Great Gatsby feels so much more grown-up, as a Luhrmann film free of the cartoonish qualities that may have dampered his prior works.

Where the film disappoints though is through its pacing, especially towards the end; the scenes, while visually stunning and often emotionally compelling through the stellar performances and soundtrack, but so much of film's motion is through mood, not action, which weighed me down by the end of this 2 1/2 hour epic. There are also some odd choices with visual effects, which you will likely know when you see them (re: the film's narrative structure).

These slight disappointments make me hesitant in my review of this film; much of it, particularly the scene when Gatsby and Nick Carroway make their deal, and the montage of Gatsby and Daisy reunited, are excellent and still stick with me long after leaving the theater. These kinds of moments are Baz Luhrmann at his best, and I wish The Great Gatsby, for all the time and effort put into it, was as sharp as these glorious scenes in the middle were.

It is still a very good movie and I recommend seeing on the big screen in gorgeous, colorful 3D. I will likely be revisiting The Great Gatsby and am anxious to see how my opinion develops as my relationship with this film continues through repeat viewings. But for now, I can only go so high as four stars.",1369440000,,3358,4.848167539267016
4972237,4,B0067EKYS6,"I finally got to see the new ""The Great Gatsby"" movie and was surprised at how good it was. I was expecting it to be awful given my opinion of director Baz Luhrmann's prior work, notably the insipid ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moulin-Rouge/dp/B000077VR3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moulin Rouge!</a>""

Although there were considerable liberties and abridgements taken with the story, the core of it was definitely preserved and, more importantly, the contradictory but simultaneously elegaic and exuberant tone of the novel was preserved.

Earlier adaptations, such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1974-version-with-Robert-Redford/dp/B00AEFY66U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1974 version with Robert Redford</a>, were so plodding as to be almost unwatchable. The 1974 movie makes the fatal mistake of being too realistic, reducing the whole affair to something like a Lifeiime television movie. That's exactly what you get from the novel if you distill the bare plot and characters but lose the tone, because the novel is ultimately structured as a nostalgic remembrance of lost hope. The deliberately unrealistic excitement of a period in time when anything seemed possible is the perfect environment for Baz Luhrmann.

In the new version, the cinematography and costumes mesh well to convey the excitement of the Jazz Age at its peak.

The music was surprisingly appropriate, the exact opposite of ""Moulin Rouge,"" with George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" -- one of my all-time favorite pieces -- as a significant recurring motif. Even the new music, especially ""Young and Beautiful,"" fits in well.

The movie is visually very impressive in a way that the novel cannot be, but it does conjure an imaginary and unrealistic world of grandiose excess that is worth seeing. The 3D gimmick is kind of pointless, but that is true for most movies.

Without spoiling anything, the opening credits begin in rough black and white with uneven lighting and flicker, very much like watching an old movie actually made in the 1920s, before the credits change to sharp and colorful gilded art deco designs. The effect is clever, making all of the flashy color that is the movie seem almost dreamlike, copying the elegaic tone of the novel. Eventually the closing credits reverse the effect back to fuzzy black and white.

Gatsby is an archetypal character whose purity and single-mindedness are his defining elements, creating a kind of naivety that distinguishes him from everyone around him -- and which eventually destroys him at the hands of those more cynical. One of the main reasons why the novel has become what it is today is that it presciently in 1925 understood that the Roaring 20s were an unsustainable party that must come to an end, which we know now from hindsight would happen with a horrific crash and decade-long hangover of the Great Depression. F. Scott Fitzgerald's almost puritanical discomfort with the Jazz Age, despite being its most enthusiastic contemporaneous chronicler, proved to strike just the right chord. A very good book about the 1920s Paris expatriate community (of which Scott and Zelda were prominent members) borrows a quote from a less well known writer as its title: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Everybody-Was-So-Young/dp/0767903706/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Everybody Was So Young</a>.""

The characters are all very dislikable, with the exception of Jay Gatsby himself. Nick Carraway is extremely self-critical, regarding himself as a failure. One of the most common criticisms of the novel is that Gatsby's interest in Daisy lacks credibility because she is something of a petulant child who needs to be taken care of, but of course she mirrors to some extent Scott's real-life wife Zelda and their co-dependent marriage. Regardless of the truth about Zelda, who was by all accounts a remarkably capable and intelligent woman, there can be no doubt that she was treated as someone who needed to be taken care of and eventually ended up confined to a mental hospital. I don't want to fall into the trap of misidentifying authors with their characters, but it seems clear that Scott intended Gatsby's interest is Daisy to be entirely credible, even if Gatsby's perception of her was idealized as a result of his naivety and boundless optimism.

The original novel is unstinting in its portrayal of the mistreatment of servants, which is intended to be offensive. What Scott Fitzgerald fully intended to condemn in 1925 looks even worse to us now, but it is an important part of the story and is an essential literary device used repeatedly to illuminate the defects of Tom Buchanan's character and worldview. The novel draws explicit parallels between Gatsby, as what would then be disparaged as a ""self-made man,"" and the servants --- both of whom Tom believes are limited and inexorably predestined by their circumstances of birth. Indeed, one of the reasons Tom is so disgusted at being described as ""the polo player"" is because being known for what he does instead of how he was born degrades him, in his own view, to the level of competition with Gatsby and the servants.

I should explain somewhat my comment about ""liberties and abridgements."" There are a number of lines of narration and dialogue that, although quite widely known and remembered from the novel, are simply gone in the movie. The opening and closing text is preserved, as it had to be, but everything else was apparently up for challenge about inclusion.

Almost all of the subplots are removed, which reduces some of the characters to very minor status, especially Jordan Baker who in the novel is an iconic representation of the independent ""new woman"" that we might today call a ""feminist,"" and is therefore a counterpart to narrator Nick Carraway who, although of respectable pedigree and a Yale alumnus, has to actually work for a living. The screenwriters were probably correct in thinking that this was of much less interest to the modern audience than it was when the novel was published. On the other hand, it makes some things incomprehensible, such as why Tom Buchanan gets so annoyed at being introduced as ""the polo player.""

The handling of the Meyer Wolfsheim character is outright bizarre, probably because there were fears of the portrayal being regarded as anti-Semitic despite the character unquestionably being based on the real-life Arnold Rothstein. For one thing, he is played by an actor whose ancestry is from India, a pretty extreme case of ""funny, he doesn't look Jewish,"" and who is the only actor who seems to have any identifiable ethnicity with a speaking role that is not a black waiter. Odd things are changed, such as his cufflinks made from human teeth turning into a tie-pin, possibly because the screenwriters were worried that the modern audience would be too confused as to what cufflinks are, but the cufflinks are significant because they are something that would not be noticed immediately but when noticed would pierce the veneer of civility -- a major theme in the novel.

It's a vibrant, colorful movie that successfully evokes, if not the real Jazz Age, then our collective historical memory of it.",1369267200,,7281,5.304423243712056
4972238,5,B0067EKYS6,"Previously Baz Luhrmann directed a version of Romeo and Juliet also starring Leonardo DiCaprio, and the visually spectacular Moulin Rouge. The Great Gatsby opened to a much higher than expected $51 million weekend.

I was highly impressed with Baz Luhrman's direction. We don't see Gatsby for a while. We know him by how others react to him before we meet him, and DiCaprio does an amazing job of bestowing his own charisma on the character to create a certain aura of mystery. We get the sense that Gatsby is not quite on the level, yet he is a caring and considerate neighbor almost to a fault, old sport.

Nick Carroway the narrator, and everyone's confidante, puts us firmly in the passenger seat to this adventure and lives next door to Gatsby's huge mansion where he throws lavish parties. Nobody knows how or where he got his money. As the movie progresses we learn why. Seemingly inconsequential events lead to unpredictable places.

Essentially, it's a story about lavishly wealthy people, who sometimes lead careless, amoral and irresponsible lives.

In the hands of Luhrmann for me at least this is a visually masterful movie, with some amazing shots. We have people dancing and swigging champagne in an open top car on the bridge into the city, and then the camera magically zooms away as the film speeds up. Was this shot from a helicopter flying at bridge level? There is a certain magical flow about how the movie unfolds visually, and moves between different visual images. I particularly liked how Gatsby in the flower scene imposes his greater reality on his neighbor's humble house, and how the woods add almost a surreal fairy tale element.

It's almost as if Gatsby is godlike and creates the universe that surrounds him. Everything except free will. Gatsby has a moment of friction with Daisy, and at his party a glass breaks.

Gatsby's place is like a Disneyland for adults. Set in the 1920s the movie boasts a fusion of musical sounds introducing a textured range of styles all the way to the current era, including some jazz and hiphop. I particularly loved a piece played on a giant Wurlitzer, and the scope of the movie is huge.

We have beautiful cars including a yellow Duesenberg, plush almost ridiculously ostentatious Long Island mansions, impeccable costumes, and a wild unrestrained feeling. We have the rich and poor hobnobbing. We have parties. I sensed rather than knew this was a Luhrmann movie because it was somewhat visually reminiscent of the style of Moulin Rouge. This was not a bad thing. In fact, I wished that the musical aspect was played up at times, with more music or seeing a theater or performance of some kind within the scenes rather the performance being a backdrop to what was happening onscreen.

And the character of Gatsby reveals first through a legend, based on image and respectability and being accepted by other rich people. Then we have the real story which for me was more impressive, and really encompasses the American dream. Perhaps that is why the story is so popular.

Gatsby is special, and destined for greatness. He always knew this, and when he meets a certain someone it motivates him to achieve that greatness. But he did not seek this greatness only for himself. If there is shadiness involved, there is also a certain purity of heart, which sometimes skirts the edges of narcissism, and personal hubris. For nothing will dissuade him from his true purpose, and he wants an equally unbridled love in return. Does that sound unreasonable?

I loved this movie. It's a refreshing change from the usual Hollywood formula. Usually one has to wait to year end for this type of quality entertainment so it's great to see such a movie in summer.

After watching this I viewed the 1974 Gatsby starring Robert Redford, Mia Farrow, Sam Waterson and Lois Chiles.
The screenplay was written by Francis Ford Coppola. I found myself wishing that Coppola also directed that movie as it was somewhat slow in pacing, and the outstanding cinematography, a hallmark of Coppola's movies would have given it added visual splendor. I certainly recommend it for a viewing if only to compare and contrast. I loved some of the music and party scenes.

It's clear that Luhrmann did use the 1974 movie as a template yet elevates this story and delivers a version that is superior in almost every respect, and the visuals especially were a feast for the senses. Some of the story elements are far clearer especially the denouement. Most importantly even though Gatsby was not perfect, Gatsby was great. And I feel privileged to have watched it. Apparently it got mixed reviews from critics. I say never mind the critics. Check it out for yourself.

It looks better than the real twenties. I think most people will enjoy it and I hope this was helpful.",1369180800,8,4801,4.818955042527339
4972239,3,B0067EKYS6,"First -- I enjoyed this movie.  It is well done, beautifully photgraphed with excellent costuming, but it really strays from the book to such an extent that it really isn't ""The Great Gatsby"" but more like a movie that was ""suggested by"" the book.  In this film Gatsby plays a much larger role and lacks all of the mystery that surrounds him in the book.  Tom plays a much smaller role and is much less of a cad while Wilson and Myrtle seem like an after thought. The connections between Tom, Myrtle, and Wilson are just hinted at.  Admittedly this film goes out its way to address and answer some of the questions about Gatsby's past that are hinted at in the book.  Daisy plays a much larger role here than in the book which makes the movie entertaining but really is only hinted at in the book. Perhaps the worst deviation from the book is the very end where the car isn't being driven by Tom but is driven by Daisy. I failed to see the need to do this other than to reach an ending which was very different from the book, other than death of Gatsby.  Still I liked the movie and DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire did a good job.

I hated the sound track which pandered to contemporary music tastes but seemed out of place in the movie.  The same with the choreography which sort of hinted at the Charleston and other contemporary dances.  I gave this film three stars because it is a good movie and worth seeing but it really isn't ""The Great Gatsby"" as written by Fitzgerald.",1369180800,,1473,4.346715328467154
4972240,2,B0067EKYS6,"Baz Luhmann (Moulin Rouge!, Romeo & Juliet) has taken his whimsical eye and transported us into F. Scott Fitzgerald's world of money, parties and power in a new screen adaption of his classic novel. The screenplay was written and adapted by Baz himself and long time writing partner Craig Pierce (Strictly Ballroom, Moulin Rouge!), but the flow and ebb of this film lacks the romance and majesty of the original novel. This film is beautiful to look at because of the wonderful cinematography by Simon Duggan (I, Robot, The Mummy 3) and has an enchanting score by Craig Armstrong (Kiss of the Dragon, Love Actually), that is when you are not listening to hip-hop, but it just rides a slow wave of visual after visual after visual. Not substance. No meat. And, a very small heart.

On the upside, Leonardo DiCaprio (Inception, Titanic) does an amazing job at playing Gatsby. He's got the swagger, the look and the innate ability to capture your attention on the big screen.  His looks and eyes celebrate all that is his characters money, power and parties all held at his lavishly decked out home along the shore. Leonardo knows how to create a character and live it well.

Equally as intriguing and taking the audience point of view is Tobey McGuire (Spider-Man, Pleasantville) playing Nick Carraway, Gatsby's new neighbor and writer of the tale that unfolds. Tobey and Leonardo have some good on screen chemistry together as well. Tobey makes an honest effort to make us as an audience believe in the wonder that is Gatsby.

As with all films, there are many plot complications that specifically revolve around Carey Mulligan (Drive, Pride & Prejudice) as Daisy Buchanan, the girl who lives big and dreams even bigger. Joel Edgerton (King Arthur, The Thing-2011) is Tom Buchanan, Daisy's husband who also has a thing or two going on, on the side himself. The chemistry and passion of these four actors is palatable when they are together, however the rest of the film falls short of the mystery and magic that was always ""The Great Gatsby"".

Long drawn out shots, beautifully executed and visually stunning, but too long and in some cases too pointless. It was also obviously shot for the 3D cinema because it's apparent certain camera angles, movement and positioning were designed to poke at you as you watch the film. It just didn't work, even for the 3D.

A modern touch for this new generation was the added hip-hop, modernized style of pop culture music added to the soundtrack. It just didn't feel right. It didn't compliment the images, in fact, it was annoyingly noticeable. Oh well, a good set of strings and horns would have done the film much better.

Overall it cannot hold a candle to the original film in terms of character development, action, glamour and pizazz, and except for the strong performances of the four I mentioned, this film reminds me of a cable TV movie rather than a big screen epic as the original text and film were. I usually enjoy all of Baz's work, but this one left me very very short!",1369180800,6,3024,4.748571428571428
4972241,4,B0067EKYS6,"My mom wanted to see this movie.  I said ok and we went to see it.  It is a period movie.  Set in the early 1900s.  But do not let that fool you.  It is not slow or boring in ANY way.  The movie starts out extremely odd.  VERY flashy.  Full of bright lights, fun music and odd people.  The only way I can describe it is this, imagine a Disney movie set in the 30s.  It is that way for a reason though.  They are trying to show you the way Gatsby lives.  After about 40 or so minutes, it gets more settled down and begins to resemble a normal movie.  Though you almost wish it would continue being the way it was.  A man who wishes to be a writer, ends up working in stocks.  He lives next door to a man named Gatsby.  They end up talking and the man gets drawn into the amazing, bright, rich, fabulous world that is the life of Gatsby.  Gatsby holds many mysteries.  There are a lot of rumors about him and how he got all of his money.  Over time the man will become friends with and learn many things about Gatsby.  He finds out that there is really only one and one thing only Gatsby really wants.  It is what he has created his entire image for.  What may come as a surprise though, is that this thing that is wanted by Gatsby, may not want or may not know what she wants.  In the end, if you really think about what you have seen, it is his expectations of this person wanting the same thing as him and the fact that he made a friend that may lead to his demise.

I hope that is not confusing.  I can say a few things extra.  I am 28 and have really began to appreciate movies.  All the work and time that goes into them.  That being said, this movie is one of the most brilliantly stunning movies that I have or will ever see.  It is so bright and flashy.  Everything looks so authentic.  As I said, the beginning of the movie is very over the top.  If you do not think you will like it, wait about 40 minutes.  It begins to transform from one art form into another.  You learn the story of the man who is Gatsby.  You learn of the thing he truly wants in life.  You being to see his own true sadness and really want him to succeed.  It really is his live for one and friendship of another that leads to his biggest problem.  I do not want to say what happens.  Watch the movie.  When it is done, think about all the events that made the man go to the place he did.  Realize what made the things become that which they were and you will understand what I am talking about.  If not, please email me and I will tell you what I mean.  Such an amazing movie.  One that I will truly be proud to own.

The reason I gave this is four is this.  The movie is about 2 hours and 20 minutes long.  At a point, you feel like everything has happened.  You wonder what else they can do.  You kind of feel it is a bit drug on.  That will go away.  But I still felt it for a bit.  That is why I give it a four out of five.",1369094400,,2910,3.887179487179487
4972242,4,B0067EKYS6,"Note: my review is of the regular version of the film as I did not see it in 3D.  I have had to read The Great Gatsby in both high school and college so it was a story that was burned into my subconcious.  Additionally, I had seen the original with Robert Redford and Kathryn Lee Scott (those are the two actors I remember) when it first came out.  This film is far superior to the original as it is a lot more fun.  The director did take a lot of liberties with the film having some modern songs put in but the director did an amazing job where you can feel the energy of Gatsby's parties and the visual effects just seemed to transport the viewer back to the 1920's.

This version of the film does follow the book story very closely, in fact, Toby McGuire as Nick narrates a lot of the film, quoting directly from the book.  DeCaprio is excellent as Gatsby however, my only beef with him is that he looks a little bit too young (remembering Redford in the original appearing to be a little bit more mature looking) to have served in the military and then waited the five years building up a fortune and hoping to woo Daisy from her husband.

The shots of New York City are stunning, even better than what I remembered from King Kong.  The one thing that the director kept showing and I wasn't sure of were some guys working with shovels in what I am assuming is Queens.  Queens is depicted as just a bunch of junkyards and also serves as the stopoff point where Daisy's husband goes for gas and to meet his mistress.  It is not clear how he gets away with seeing her without her husband knowing though.

Nick narrates the story while he seems to be treated in a sanitarium.  Even watching the movie it is not clear why he eventually ends up there.  Don't remember if this was specifically explained in the book.  Nick seems to be the ""nice"" guy that everybody likes and he acts as the go-between between everybody especially between his cousing Daisy and Gatsby.

I am not a big fan of 3D but I would like to see this film again in 3D just for the excellent visual effects.",1369094400,,2075,4.271099744245524
4972243,5,B0067EKYS6,"While reading The Great Gatsby in school my imagination went wild putting faces to characters while trying to fathom the extravagant parties Gatsby threw. I imagined the roaring twenties meets mardi-gras. Confetti and beads, flapper girls and zoot suits, alcohol and speak easies... everything the twenties had to offer a lonely, hopelessly in love millionaire. The first movie was a huge disappointment. In fact, I fell asleep while watching it. The book was more exciting and I couldn't stand my teachers attempt to make The Great Gatsby less of a hassle by forcing us to watch this god awful movie... but THIS version! Oh my god this version of the movie was PERFECT! Everything I hoped for! Leonardo Dicaprio did a fantastic job as Gatsby and the actress for Daisy blew my mind. All the characters were spot on, even the extras. The parties were explosive and they didn't leave out any details of the book. They did try to modernize it a bit by mixing rap/hip hop in with some less than classical genres but it sort of worked. What would anyone in the twenty first century expect? A black and white film about a millionaire without some over the top tidbits? If anyone can appreciate a good movie based on a book it's me and I make a habit of reading or re-reading the book before I watch a movie. This movie was great! I'm buying it the day it comes out and I may even see it in theaters again. At the very very very least, 4 stars, because there was one really nasty black woman that kept ""twerking"" during some of the party scenes. Without her the movie would have been dynamite xD",1369008000,3,1588,4.536585365853658
4972244,4,B0067EKYS6,"First of all I'd like to say that I liked the film. Not for its ability to translate the novel,which it didn't,but for making a film which stood up in its own right,for creating a parallel universe of the Gatsby phenomemon. The excess of the parties was a little too excessive,in that everything seemed too rehearsed,too razz-a-ma-tazz,too many fireworks,too much glitter and confetti,it all looked like it was going to go up in smoke or evaporate. It treated everything like it was pushing success,materialism,designer goods,conspicuous consumption,at the expense of the hollowness andfailure,the disillusionment and disenchantment of Gatsby's dream. It's OK in 2D,by the way.

Lurhmann uses a clever framing device as the film opens with Nick Carraway (McGuire),recounting episodes from his life in rehab,unwinding to a psychiatrist in detox from alcohol. This forms the basis of his writing of the novel The Great Gatsby. He is both inside and outside everything like Fitzgerald looking in to worlds that exclude him. This is a useful technique to have the narrator tell the story. But it makes the mistake somewhere in an early party of saying he'd been drunk just twice in his life! What Lurhmann does well is recreate the area of East Egg and West Egg, and the stretch of water in between Gatsby's mansion and Daisy's and Tom's Buchanan.

The drive from New York through the marvellous Ash Heaps near the Wilson's garage, is superbly realized,with help from a camera moving skywards out into the water. The fast cars are very fast with beautiful coach work. Best of all DiCaprio pulled off the greatest of the 3 filmed Gatsby's. He hints at the great dream that's driven him to create his mansion and all his wealth as well as the dark side. Cary Mulligan too suggests very well the unobtainable rich girl,but also the shallowness and inability to take responsibility after the crash or even to choose Gatsby after all. The minor characters,the Wilson's,Jordan Baker,Dan Cody not drawn so well. Joel Edgerton plays Tom Buchanan as if to the manner born,with nastiness and aggression.

Jaz-y's music is used cleverly to suggest all the influences of the Roaring Twenties as well as the bling. Lurhmann has ventriloquised New York waterways and skyscrapers from his base in Australia using special effects. This film has been hyped for so long I almost never saw it,and its been slated by the critics. But having seen previous films Romeo and Juliet(updated) and Moulin Rouge(all singing & dancing),I think he has done a version of 2013 in 1922 and he's breathed new energy and life(Ok 3D)at a time of depression in world markets into this perfect gem of a book. Whether Daisy was worthy of the intensity of Gatsby's love is another question.",1369008000,,2746,4.991266375545852
4972245,4,B0067EKYS6,"The first hour seemed a little lost and slow but after that, the film gets better and better. Leonardo Di Caprio shines as Jay Gatsby and Carey Mulligan is superbly sultry as Diasy. Their chemistry is sizzling. The film bears the unmistakable OTT trademark of Baz Lurmann and his penchant for tragic endings (Romeo+Juliet, Moulin Rouge). The songs that appear on the film's soundtrack make more sense when featured in the film. In any case, this is a film adaptation of a literary classic and it's impossible to move everything on screen but it serves its purpose to entertain and perhaps, quickly educate the new generation unfamiliar with Fitzgerald.",1368748800,,652,4.990825688073395
4972246,4,B0067EKYS6,"Baz Luhrmann's ""The Great Gatsby"" is the third film version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 immortal novel. Faithful to the book, mostly a remake of David Merrick's excellent 1974 movie, ""The Great Gatsby"" deposits a 1920's love story into the CG twenty-first century. And does it well. Very well. Nick Carraway is a failed 1920's bond salesman. Nick enters a sanitarium to treat his anxiety and alcohol abuse. The doctor recommends that Nick write. Write stories. Nick and his typewriter pound out a novel about Nick's friend, a mysterious, handsome millionaire who wore pink suits, and sometimes stared down at Nick from his mansion windows. But mostly, Jay Gatsby looked across the sound, from West Egg, to the beautiful home of Daisy Buchanan, his one-time lover. Gatsby must find a way to get Daisy back, because if he doesn't, his bags of money, and all-night jazz parties won't matter. And neither will his life....Director Baz Luhrmann shot most of ""Gatsby"" in his native Australia; dazzling special effects, rock music, and plain-old magic remind you of Luhrmann's excellent ""Moulin Rouge(2001)"" and the very good ""Australia(2008)"". Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a strong, romantic  Gatsby; he does say ""old sport"" too much. And if you're a little tired, or not paying attention, you might just think you're watching the last Gatsby, Robert Redford. An old, sad love story in a mind-bending modern new format is actually very fine. Very fine. ""Gatsby picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He did not know that his dream was already behind him. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter---tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one fine morning---So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"".",1368662400,,1864,5.0519480519480515
4972247,4,B0067EKYS6,"The Great Gatsby (2013) is a film that really seeks to capture the attention of the modern generation and transplant all watching into a style and way of life not seen for almost 90 years. The film has received mixed reviews and after seeing the film I believe that the reviews were quite harsh. I did thoroughly enjoy the film, even if I found the first 20 minutes to be atrocious. The editing, close up, and text that appeared throughout the film were quite distracting and it did pull me out of the film and Roger Ebert comically said that Gatsby's yellow roadster ""moves as believably as the talking cab in 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit.'"" But thankfully the acting and visuals saved this film from being a complete dud. The acting was the absolute best interpretation of the characters that I have seen in any of the other film adaptations of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald's granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan said that ""This really was Baz Luhrmann's take on 'Gatsby' and I think he had every right to pump it up with music and make it very lively for our modern ears.""  I understand that The Great Gatsby is a difficult novel to adapt to film as the whole thing is narrated, but Baz Lurhmann and crew did an exceptional job with the notion of creating a Gatsby for the 21st century and for the younger generation even if there are some things I would have liked to see done differently. Read the book before you see any of the films because none of the films will ever do the book justice but I think that Baz Lurhmann's 'Gatsby' comes the closest to really portraying the characters as accurately as possible.",1368489600,,1618,4.5793103448275865
4972248,5,B0067EKYS6,"I was fully prepared to see another movie where Hollywood's cash of directors spent their entire wad of creativity on special effects and over-the-topness, and they certainly did. After all, this is a movie based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic novel, ""The Great Gatsby"", a story of decadence, excess and circumstance. Yet, Director Baz Luhrman (Moulin Rouge, Romeo + Juliet) delivered an equal amount of substance and character with his beautiful painting.

Luhrman delivered the largeness and decadence that the movie deserved, but also delivered upon the small world that Gatsby has embedded himself in. Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a character of great mystery. He has huge decadent parties, yet nobody truly knows the man. While Luhrman's cameras sweep and swoop through Gatsby's lavish party of dance and drink, we feel the moment like it should and at the same time, we feel Gatsby's emptiness when he stands alone against the backdrop of his amazing mansion. Luhrman's atmosphere, at times, was allowed to do the talking and the great actors chewed up the rest of it.

The cinematography of ""Gatsby"" is absolutely brilliant and the 3D that goes with it is vital. You have to feel that depth and largeness to truly feel the world that surrounds Gatsby. It is proof that 3D doesn't have to be in your face to be effective. The depth of it gives you the feeling of being there and it is absolutely beautiful. The ocean water that separates Gatsby from the mansions across the way, the deep shots of New York City in its early stages and the exploding confetti and dance during the party scenes are all so perfectly done but at the same time chaotic and consuming; drawing you into the world.

I didn't think I would be saying this, but Luhrman's film is near perfect. It is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen. What really puts it over the top though is the quality of the actors involved. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Jason Clarke and Isla Fischer were all perfect. Watching DiCaprio bring Gatsby to life makes me wonder how this guy has gone without an Oscar so far. He has become something great, if he was ever anything less.

""The Great Gatsby"" is what going to the movies is all about. It brought the beautiful words of F. Scott Fitzgerald to life in its own unique and beautiful way. It is pure escapism. I can honestly say I was riveted from beginning to end. Earlier I stated that the film was `near perfect' and I have to say, there were a few instances where my mind left the roaring 20's. Twice the movie soundtrack, produced by Jay-Z, was horribly too 21st century. Instead of using music from the era, they used two rap songs that shook me from the dream that I had fallen into and reminded me that this was a 21st century movie made by 21st century actors and directors. Fortunately, those moments were fleeting and the escapism dream continued. Honestly though, that is the only blemish I spotted in a mostly flawless film.

This is also a 3D movie masterpiece and if you have the means to watch this in 3D; do it. If you don't, you aren't getting the entire experience.",1368489600,,3152,4.682310469314079
4972249,5,B0067EKYS6,"Wow. Baz and Jay-Z together have really done it. It's flashy and definitely different, but I believe it tells Fitzgerald's story well in this time without really modernizing it. The acting was phenomenal, the scenes and costumes superb; the whole movie was just great. There were just a few parts left out or changed from the book, however I don't think it altered the story very much at all. I had to read this book in high school a few years ago and I think my generation will like this movie the most, but I really loved it. One of my favorite movies of all time, maybe my favorite book-to-movie.",1368403200,,599,4.454545454545454
4972250,4,B0067EKYS6,"This story hit too close to home! I can strongly identify with Gatsby. The problem is that when you go to the movies most people, like myself, wants to escape and not be reminded of their failed relationships! I also don't like seeing unapologetic evil win in the end, either! It's too depressing. In the real world there are way too many people like Daisy and her husband!

To all the critics who tore this film apart: shame on you! This is an extremely well done movie. You critics don't hesitate shilling for Iron Man, practically comparing it to Shakespeare, but a story with a great screenplay,acting, cinematography and music you trash. Even people who rarely go to movies are telling me how bad The Great Gatsby is because the critics all hate it.

All I can say to whomever reads this review: stop being manipulated like you're a sheep! Be your own judge of what is worthy to watch on the big screen! If you're still curious, read the dopey critics after you watch a film!",1368403200,,980,4.531073446327683
4972251,2,B0067EKYS6,"It must be awfully tough, restrictive and artistically unsatisfying for actors nowadays to give performances when they spend most of their time in front of blue-screens and not in actual, real, tangible locations.  Maybe that is why none of the actors in this take on the classic novel seem convincing whatsoever. Every performance seems as unreal and phony as the CGI settings that surround it. Another terrible thing is the style over substance approach of this movie. For example, when Gatsby and Nick are driving into the city there is much important dialog being spoken - but it is all but lost to the winds as the ADHD-afflicted camera/computer dart about the car and the road, showing us every view and angle imaginable, yet in doing so scene-stealing the stuff of the only real things in this sequence - and that is the actors, whose words are subjugated to the style. And, sadly, this is par for the course for most all of the movie.

The argument could be made that the world of Gatsby is, indeed, a superficial, phony, unreal world - and that this essential vapidness is what is being captured via the mind-deadening overuse of the movie-killing Monster that is CGI.  But this is a razor's edge.  In the case of this film, there are nicks and cuts galore that threaten the heart of the story, the reality of the romance below the glitz and glamor. Too many scenes are simply run over roughshod, the same way Wilson's wife gets the deadly bump from the yellow Rolls. And then there is the odious soap opera-ish musical underscore to the whole thing that tries too hard to make us feel what the visuals and dialog may fail to make us feel.  It creeps into every scene, further enhancing the phoniness of the entire affair. As to the use of hip hop, the question is why?  I understand the argument that contemporary music is used to make modern audiences feel more relevant to the moment of a period film, but then why not update fashions as well?  Cars, too?  Heck, why not just uproot the whole story and plant it in a 21st century setting?  The point is - where does it end?  And why NOT utilize the jazz music from the actual era being depicted?  The popular music then was a helluva lot better than the music of today! One reason for the choice in music may have been to be...controversial.  Controversy gets people talking - and in this world anymore there is nothing worse than not being talked about!

When will money-mad movie makers and their too obliging, too accepting audiences reach a long overdue saturation point and realize that more often than not less is more - and that just because a thing can be technologically done doesn't therefore mean it should be.  When will a tree be a tree again?  A sky...a sky?  When will so many highly purchased actors truly act again - and not simply falsely react and become as unreal as the things around them that aren't really there?  When will movies be more than the grandiose computer games so many of them now are?  When will movies again care more for substance over style?

Despite its own faults, the Robert Redford GATSBY is quantum leaps above and beyond this latest outing.  I think I'll revisit it now - and in doing so remember what directing, acting, mood, pacing, quality are all about.  Substance, yes, over style.",1368403200,9,3293,4.5948717948717945
4972252,4,B0067EKYS6,"The Great Gatsby is a novel that has famously failed to cross into other mediums. With this latest adaptation, by director Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge), I was curious to see how Luhrmann's unique style would translate to this classic story. I entered the theater with a fair amount of trepidation, especially after the largely mixed reviews that I'd read. To my surprise, however, I really enjoyed this adaptation.

There were a couple of major alterations to the novel's original story, namely Nick's background and the events that take place after his time with Gatsby, but the film was mostly faithful to the novel. Many of the reviews argued against the director's style over substance approach, but I completely disagree with these claims. While there are moments of dazzling camera acrobatics and 3D effects, there are also many moments of quiet introspection. DiCaprio's Gatsby is probably the most sincere portrayal of this character that will ever appear on film. His interactions with both Maguire's Nick and Mulligan's Daisy seemed genuine, and I could really feel the soul of the man behind the facade he had made for himself.

This Unique interpretation will, no doubt, garner a variety of reactions amongst the faithful readers and casual moviegoers. In the end, it is probably impossible to perfectly translate the intentions of the novel into a film, but this one comes pretty close.",1368403200,7,1398,5.100436681222708
4972253,5,B0067EKYS6,"I have rather enjoyed Luhrmann's films. Romeo & Juliet, Australia, and Moulin Rouge were for me mildly entertaining and moderately successful, but while I have been able to appreciate his vision, I have always felt there was something that does not quite gel. Until now.

Before seeing this film, I always thought Gatsby was unworkable as a movie adaptation. The 1974 Jack Clayton effort felt stiff and insincere. Even screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola practically disowned it. I vaguely suspected this was not the fault of the director or actors, but that perhaps Gatsby was simply untranslatable to film. I was wrong.

Fortunately, Baz Luhrmann has finally found his calling. His attention to detail coupled with his absolute rejection of subtlety works for Gatsby. He manages to retain the symbolism, pushing image after image in the faces of the viewers. This is especially noticeable by those who have viewed this in 3D.

His brazen approach is matched with an incredible attention to detail. For example, the ""man in the cool shirt"" is shown several times early on in the film on the New York billboard. Also, Nick Carroway is clearly portrayed as Fitzgerald himself who was negatively impacted by the East-coast lifestyle of the 1920s.

Direction aside, the soundtrack to this film is incredible! It would have been easy to use only period music, but instead the film includes music by newer artists who use 1920s elements. Rather than watching and thinking, ""This is a period piece,"" the music along with the in-your-face direction and production invite the audience to feel the excitement of the 1920s. It is just plain fun!

In conclusion, this is an adaptation that finally does the novel justice. Go see it.",1368403200,3,1719,5.017543859649122
4972254,5,B0067EKYS6,"Having just finished teaching Gatsby, I went in with very low expectations. However, I thought this new version did a very good job of presenting the Jay Gatsby I know- he is very electric in his love/obsession of/with Daisy. I agree that Daisy, herself, was cut too much slack. I'm not sure why they decided to make her seem reasonable, but other than that, I was pleased with the production. I'm glad we are still interested in keeping The Great Gatsby relevant.",1368403200,,464,4.670731707317073
