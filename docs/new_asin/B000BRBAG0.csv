8091452,2,B000BRBAG0,"Oops, this is just a Troma flick, and there's really no point in reviewing anything specific aside from making a general observation.  First, being a Troma chick vid, the only purpose of it is to show nude models, and pretty nice ones too.  The rest of the film is apparently populated by members of the film crew judging by the acting (and most of them are wearing hoods anyway).  It's a pretty telling tip off when the DVD features a quick link to the nude parts!

Okay, there's nothing wrong with the tradition of using a horror/killer flick to display skin, right?  Well . . . in 1994, maybe.  Now?  No way.  There is so much nudity available on TV and especially the internet, needless to say, that no excuse is needed anymore.  Try typing any girl's name on a global search of usenet postings, the typical response is maybe 10 thousand images and videos, 99.9% of which are porn.  Nudity here, nudity there, nudity everywhere!  Troma is going to have to harden up and get out the whips and torture chambers, because as it stands their films are too corny and too nudie cutie to be of interest to the sleaze crowd.

That's it, two stars for cute girls and the NTRL factor (nudity to total running length), but I gotta say, the NTRL factor is reaching the end of its useful life.",1167868800,8,1283,4.435897435897436
