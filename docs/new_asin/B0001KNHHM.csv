The film is great, like a (now relatively) modern version of silent film comedies.  I don't speak French, but found the film pretty easy to follow, even with some interesting plot twists.  Both Bardot and Perkins were funny and charming.  It's a really creative comedy and I'm very glad I bought it!",1382227200,,406,4.757142857142857
8013827,3,B0001KNHHM,"I decided to give this film a shot because I am a fan of Cold War era comedies. I must say, this is a very strange film and I'm not sure I completely understood the plot. I do not speak French, and therefore had to rely on the shoddily made English subtitles. Because of this, I had no idea what was going on in some scenes. Whoever made the subtitles was probably not a native English speaker because there were so many spelling and grammar issues. This is a big problem because the film is a farce and much of the jokes are dialogue heavy. I could tell that the humour was getting lost in translation.

Another strange thing about this film is the way it speeds up the action during slapstick scenes. It is jarring and distracting. Some of these scenes had the potential to be very amusing but they fell flat because of this cheesy effect. It took away from the film a great deal. Nevertheless, Brigitte Bardot and Anthony Perkins are cute together and there are many funny and well-done scenes. They just do not come together to form a coherent plot. If you do not understand French I would skip this film.",1372982400,2,1109,4.383495145631068
