As a world war buff I was excited about watching a documentary on the First World War, after seeing The World At War series about World War II. But I gotta say this was more a documentary on the time period itself rather than the main event of that time period. The narration was horrible. Nowhere near the standards of Laurence Olivier. If you're interested in the highlights of the early 20th century then perhaps this movie is for you. But if you're expecting an in-depth analysis of the causes and effects of World War I, as well as the general spirit among the world at that time, then you'll be sadly disappointed. Frankly, this is the type of movie they show middle school and high school history classes right before a test. Even the narrator's breakdown of the causes and effects of World War I was so simple it felt like I was back in school watching one of those boring documentaries and taking notes. I can only hope one day they come out with a much better documentary about the Great War. The problem of course is that unlike The World At War series where they interviewed actual people who were alive during WW2, I don't think there is really anyone left to interview about WW1. Good luck finding someone.",1387756800,2,1272,4.534782608695652
7795699,4,0935621210,"This tape is a good companion to the author's book on the same subject.  In fact, it helps the text of that book to 'come alive' with greater meaning and clarity.  Reading the book first will also help in understanding the author's spoken English, which is a bit difficult at times.  It's even occasionally funny in a few places and the author has a good sense of humor.",1386288000,,370,4.411764705882353
7795700,3,0935621210,I bought this film to use in my high school social studies classes.  I found that I was unable to do so.  The program is very slow and just shows the primary footage.,1331683200,2,166,4.0
7795701,1,0935621210,"I bought this item as an impulse buy at a discount store. Big mistake. Poorly written and edited, it jumps around and spends, for example, the first about ten minutes talking about the growth of the motion picture industry in California! Overly simplistic and heavily reliant on what I'd guess is public domain film, it tries to piece things together based upon what film clips it has available. Pass on this one. Even at $4.00 it is a waste of money.",1285372800,4,451,4.580246913580247
7795702,1,0935621210,"Not only is this DVD poorly written, edited and directed it also contains several inaccuries -- my favorite is ""the historian"" Gary Rhay (who?) refering to the German/Austro-Hungarian alliance as The Axis.  It glosses over several major themes while spending far too much time on boring and repetetive film footage.  I could go on and on but sufficite it to say save your money and look elsewhere.  Except as comedy and as a sleep aid this DVD has no value.",1234656000,17,457,4.6875

 Very interesting way to visualize chi kung, much hard to find information. Even the slowlier learner will get the info ;-). Idiot proof.",1141948800,2,317,5.076923076923077
7795705,2,0935621210,"Correct me if I'm wrong but the US did enter the war 2-3 years after the other allies, yes? Well, you'd never know it from watching this muddled and patched together account of WW1. From the outset you are into an almost total US perspective of WW1, and considering the other allies had been engaged in fighting for such a long time before the US arrived, this is a bit much to take.  It also means that a lot of interesting and crucial non-US perspective is missed out.
The narrator is, well, how can I say this kindly?  Well you get the feeling he is narrating this while facing and talking to his living room wall.  It could and should have been done with a lot more passion. Everything was 'ineresin' (yuk!) or 'kind o' (oh no!) etc etc. a casual style of presentation that really detracted from the seriousness of the event. By tape 7 I was definitely feeling maybe this would be better with sound off.",1030752000,11,907,4.386904761904762
7795706,2,0935621210,"This series has the look and feel of something that was slapped together for the educational market.  The film's only real virtue is a large amount of original period footage, but  the accompanying narration is banal and  often inaccurate. This is ,at best ,an archive and not  a compelling history.  Definitely a far cry  from  the Robert Ryan/CBS News 1964 documentary, which is regrettably out of print.",1004745600,7,406,4.970149253731344
7795707,4,0935621210,This video is for the individual is who seeking to master themselves.  The video is easy to understand and contains a wealth of knowledge.  It would be to your benefit however to purchase the book as well.,980294400,6,205,4.513513513513513
