Suspense is built.
Sheridan addresses how to add little suspense elements to each scene. This will keep your story moving with lots of tension. There are literally hundreds of ideas just one right after the other, all of which fire up ideas for your own story. You will never make a boring movie or story again after watching this class!

8311399,5,B001IV61E4,"Ever watch a boring film or write a boring story? Not if you have seen this video. Literally 100's of ideas on how to make your story have cliff hanger moments in each scene. Simple things like adding a ticking clock or showing the bad guy doing really horrible things to someone else first. I found this to be one of my favorite videos in the series since the ideas are so easy to apply to any story and make it better right away.

It took me a few months to get through all 19 of these videos but now I have a great script! Lots of info on things I never learned in any writing or film class. Special focus on digital film making and animation too. There are samples of this class on YouTube which is how I found out about it. It has changed the way I write and made it much easier to plan out. Great for students or people new to digital film or animation!",1244332800,,859,4.052941176470588
