Cinema Insomnia is a wonderful example of ""new blood"" (pun definitely intended) coming to the rescue!

Mr. Lobo is dryly humorous, and does a creditable job of presenting this ""documentary"".

The only negative is the incessant vintage trailers - perhaps these should have been an extra, leaving just the feature presentation.  But then again, I never viewed this in its broadcast version and apologise if this is an integral part of the program.

Definitely recommended - I will certainly purchase further editions of CI.",1263427200,3,618,5.13
8278973,3,B001AQZRW4,"Well - this product certainly confused me.  I was looking for the Roddenberry ""documentary"" that preceded the series ""In Search Of..."" but my only option was this sort of Elvira-ish version with a guy called Mr. Lobo doing shcticky-bits between episode segments.

On the bright side he's got a good voice and isn't quite as campy as say Zacherly...  On the dim side, if you want to skip and just watch the ""feature"" you have to use a crapload of fast-forward because the chapter breaks are tied to Mr. Lobo's segments.

The feature itself has a perpetual red-ish tint and I almost expect to hear the clicking of a projector as it looks like it was a videotaped transfer from an 8mm projecting in someone's basement.  (I'm sure it wasn't, and perhaps the thing was always this crummy?)

Anyway, I think I'll rent ""Chariots of the Gods"" and see if it is as bad as this.  This regardless of the preposterous content, mind you.  Von D's source material is as bad as the quality of the film by way of facts - but I'm going for nostalgia here.",1231200000,8,1037,4.4787234042553195
