8670399,2,B00M58FROY,I would have rather seen a few of the off camera deaths. Than witness his woodworking.  Just ok. Kept me entertained....but I was let down.,1442707200,,139,4.56
8670400,3,B00M58FROY,"Shame!
  Could have been good thriller/horror?  But along the way lost the plot!!!
Towards the end  - - - 10mins resulting in NOTHING!
Ground in a blanket of snow, Black man walking about with saw,comes to a log
pours himself hot drink.goes off walking, next seen pulling cut down xmas tree
encounters killer & runs off, back to his cabin phones police.
He is neither killed/or seen again?
Then we are treated to a few scenes of the killer doing woodwork.
Then the penny drops! - - - Better finish the movie!
Could have at least extras.

8670401,3,B00M58FROY,This movie was ok but not my favorite ive seen much better independent horror movies. This movie did have an interesting plot but lacked allot of action and gore.,1420848000,2,162,4.620689655172414

8670404,5,B00M58FROY,"In my mind, the best horror movie ever made for $7,000 .... My mind IS a little biased, however.

Enjoy the Gore!",1414022400,4,113,4.136363636363637
