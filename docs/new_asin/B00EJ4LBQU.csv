8605911,5,B00EJ4LBQU,"Simon Callow did fine job with this Albee adaptation of McCullers' short story.  The fight scene, difficult to read about or to stage, is very good.  Good casting: Vanessa Redgrave is just right for the lead (I usually find her difficult to watch --the actor and the acting too present, the character not).  In Callow's production the character lives and is believable (good directing?).

Note: I was unable to play the DVD obtained thru Amason -- perhaps because it was European-made and formatted?. I was eventually able to obtain a copy thru my library that was compatible with my devices.",1506816000,,592,4.89
