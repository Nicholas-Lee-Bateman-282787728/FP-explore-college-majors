8550341,2,B00AEB7E0Y,"Its got all the elements of a slasher but I didn't detect a heartbeat. I really couldn't care one iota for anyone, protags or antag. Hey, at least the antag had some atmosphere in his looks. I hate when they insert a big guy in overalls and call it a day. A killer needs some energy, an 'it' factor. This guy had a good look but no energy either. Actually many of his poses were counter-intuitive. I don't know if its the same in British culture, but stooped shoulders and a somewhat hunched head conjures low self confidence and self esteem. There wasn't a shred of meaningful or interesting or even entertaining dialogue, just incidental stuff. Like, ""you're a jerk."" ""No, you are."" ""Where's Whassername? (X10000)"" and then ""go left to find Wasshername"", etc. The script must've taken 20 minutes to write.  I don't get tension, dread, horror, suspense, or pretty much any sensation I look to get from the horror genre when I am watching someone go about carving up bodies. Its in the HOW they carve the bodies up, and I don't mean methodology. A cleaver or a chainsaw is irrelevant. Its all in the killer's style, which is best conveyed through subtle choices, like body language, movements, extracurricular scenes (when he's not killing), etc . While the visual values were good, the killer's style was bland and not at all thrilling or entertaining. Didn't work for me.",1406851200,2,1373,4.720833333333333

8550343,3,B00AEB7E0Y,"This film starts out as a British gang movie and half way through suddenly becomes a slasher film.

A group of young adults agree to place a broadcasting antenna for a pirate radio broadcast (they still do that with the Internet?) on top of Mercy Point, an abandoned apartment building taken over by rats and pigeons. They also decide to party with mind altering drugs. When the expecting Jemma (Sophie Stuckey) goes missing, her boyfriend Lloyd (Jacob Anderson) leads a search party with the expected knife/ nail gun slasher film results.

I watched the film not realizing the slasher aspect, which made it a surprise for me and slightly more enjoyable. The film description gives this aspect away. I liked the setting and set up, although the slasher had no personality. There appears to have been some connection between the slasher and Jemma, although that was not known or developed. Likewise, we know nothing about the slasher until the end. It seems they set this film up for a sequel which will add interesting and intriguing aspects they opted to leave out of this one.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1374969600,2,1121,4.828125
