stooge like Bernard Piper-Collins, a cult-

ist to review his video to get 'kudos',

there must be something wrong with it.

For the definative review see Bradley

Smith's Report, #133, Nov. 2006 for

Prof. Butz cmplete review. It is above

average to good, like the very fine

Lorraine Day says, but it's not good

enough. Especially with losers like

I've seen the swimming pools and the buildings where stage plays and orchestra concerts were given, but I've never seen this kind of footage with the inmates performing. . . .

""This past week, I showed your DVD to a group of people in my home, some of whom knew nothing about revisionism.  They had believed in the Holocaust all their lives.  But after seeing just that one DVD, they became believers in the truth.""

--Lorraine Day, M.D.

""Really excellent job on this one...""

""...Once again, you have produced a very useful and fact-filled presentation, in a time frame that is ""watchable"" for most Americans.""

--Harrell Rhome, Ph. D.

""Your revisionist video is top-notch.

""The whole time I was watching it I was thinking, 'This is something I want my friends to see.'""

--Michael Collins Piper, distinguished writer/author/talk show host

""Sensational - a must for those who seek the TRUTH!

""Today I received your DVD. I am speechless, not because I have the honour of being first off the rank in your story but for your wonderful narration of a difficult topic within 50 minutes.  The music and narration volume is good because the voice is full and the music compliments it...

""This is great stuff - I will publicize it as well as I can.

""...[Y]ou have made it - you've made it to the DVD Holocaust Revisionism - beware Guido Knopp, Stephen Spielberg and other 'Holocaust'  believers.

""I am speechless with gratitude for what you have created -- this is great stuff.""
