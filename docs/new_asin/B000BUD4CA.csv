8092883,4,B000BUD4CA,"This is a very funny video.  One thing, I love the behind the scenes on all of the stupid and funny things they did (""Nice dress, Chris!"" lol.).  And also the bloopers are really funny. But one thing, why don't they have anything for Allison, and/or Ttark??  That's why my review is only 4 stars, not 5.  I love this video, nonetheless.",1296604800,,336,4.370967741935484
