The official title of this DVD is ""Asleep at the Wheel: Then and Now - Forty Years on Film and in Concert"" but Amazon seems to have ""edited"" the title.

The (now) Austin-based western swing band, Asleep at the Wheel, has been producing great music and touring as many as 300 days a year for the last 44 years! The original line up of five members first grw by adding two fiddle players and then when disco music came n their hits stopped coming and all the originals left except for founding member Ray Benson. Benson has kept the band alive through good times and bad and, though there have been 90 different members of AATW, Benson is still there. I got to see the band open for the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (another group from the 1970s that is still going with at least three original members) last year near Philly and they were great. Benson still plays guitar and sings lead but hes brough a new y9ounger generation into the fold too.
Last month Benson was involved in two new releases on the AATW label  Bismeaux Records. One is Bensons first solo record  outside of the band. Ill be reviewing that shortly. The other is this great DVD which, I feel, is a must for AATW fans, whether new or long-term. The hour-long DVD is divided into two programs. First is a wonderful  34-minute documentary which tells the history of the bands founding in 1970 in Paw Paw, WV. Yep, the town was as rural as it sounds and Benson describes the original band members as counter culture kids who liked western Swing music. In the film Benson goes back to Paw Paw in 2013 and finds the original shack still standing. Using comments and interviews with a few of the other band founder plus Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, Bill Kirchen, George Strait,  Director Dan Karlok inserts some great archival TV footage (including appearances on German television) and a few quick moments from the 40th Anniversary Reunion Concert held at Armadillo World Headquarters in Austin in 2010.  Another highlight is a tour of the AATW tour bus. If youve ever wondered how 7 musicians can live in a bus, this will answer that question. The documentary alone would be worth seeing, but, since it is so short, Executive Producer Benson added six full performances from the 2010 reunion concert to add another 23 minutes to the DVD. Im sure the full concert was recorded, so Im not sure why we only get six songs. But Ill certainly settle for that as its great stuff.

The DVD is packed in long digipak and inside is a list of each and every performer who played on each of the six concert songs. Theres also a list of thank yous and some black and white photos of the babnd in their early days.
Ive really enjoyed watching this DVD and can highly recommend it to all AATW fans and anyone who is a fan of the western swing style of Bob Wills.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
