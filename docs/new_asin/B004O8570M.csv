8437015,5,B004O8570M,"Whore Angels.... What's a great title! My girlfriend is a whore but she is an angle for me. That's why I watched this movie!
Anyway, I really loved this movie. This is not just like a regular soft core sex film. It has a deep theme behind: An angels fights against a demon, but the script writer, Takao Nakano (Big Tits Zombie), made it even funnier.
Also, I really liked one of the evil chicks, Shoko Kudo. She is hot and awesome! I remember she was in Takao Nakano's ""Sumo Vixen.'
Director, Mototsugu Watanabe, did a great job! This movie is equivalent to ""Sexy Battle Girls!""
Also, I really appreciate Pink Eiga, Inc. They always bring awesome movies  to the U.S. audiences.
You guys are rock!",1330560000,9,696,4.523809523809524

Some of them thought I was crazy but the rest were on the same boat as me. This movie has everything drama, comedy and lets not for get some great sex scenes! It's not the best shot film but who cares when you have a chick that heals people with sex acts. don't get me started on the villains talk about laughing your but off. you should def check it out if you get a chance.",1302652800,22,531,3.8807339449541285
