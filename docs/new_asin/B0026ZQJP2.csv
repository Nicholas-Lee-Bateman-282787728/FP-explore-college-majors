3857834,2,B0026ZQJP2,"From the moment the film started it was clear who the murderer was. No he was not clever, the people were dull. In fact the film was dull. The transfer visuals were so dark it was almost impossible to make out the action on the screen. Film noir by its nature helps to build suspense by the use of showdowy black and white  photography but this Dvd it just was dark or should I say dull. Definately not a sharp picture. The audio track was also dull at times it was hard to hear the dialogue especially Cluade Rains.

Then there is the issue of the price. It is way to high for the product you get. Choose another film noir you will be happy you did.",1277424000,3,650,4.110236220472441
3857835,5,B0026ZQJP2,"My review is not about the movie Unsuspected. As always another great film starring one of the most gifted and underrated actors of the 30's & 40's Claude Raines.
 My comments are about the ridiculous prices both Amazon and Warner places on these great old films.
First..Amazon charges more for these Warner Archives films than their Studio Store charges.
Second..Warner put these films out on DVD-R. The cheapest recording medium available.  I understand why...the cost. It would add greatly to the purchase price,to put out a fully loaded DVD. But shouldn't the 19.95 price the Warner Bros Store charges, include some of the shipping charges
as well?",1263168000,7,652,5.08411214953271
3857836,4,B0026ZQJP2,"You have to be patient... this movie is almost perfect, but the first 30 minutes definitely need better editing. I have read in a TV magazine that Michael North, intended to figure as the male lead, wasn't convincing, so that the studio reduced his part considerably. You may see this in the first 30 minutes which are extremely confusing and over-constructed. Persons appear, disappear, do mysterious things, reappear, seem to commit suicide, seem to be murdered, seem to be killed by accident, seem to suffer amnesia and to have forgotten that they are married... it is a thoroughly directed, very atmospheric, but somehow crude picture which is much too mysterious, even for a mystery thriller. It is almost impossible to identify with one of the persons or to follow one of the subplots before the switch of the switch of the switch makes the film shift to a completely new subplot...

But be patient, it's worth it, and the last two thirds are excellent. It gets quite clear that much is a fake in a witty, very clever and sometimes perverse attempt of radio announcer Claude Rains to murder those who are in his way - therefore, Michael North has to play a false role himself in order to discover the truth. This, of course, will be very dangerous for him and for a girl he falls in love with. What you will see is a clever film noir of dense atmosphere with an outstanding Claude Rains as the villain (which he does with the same sardonic aplomb as in ""Deception"") who is the unofficial lead. Mike Curtiz' direction is on the top of his art. Much suspense, long shadows, superimpositions, mirrors, elegant camera movements, long, dark bars, strange camera angles focusing menacing objects (such as a glass with poisoned Champaign), significant close-ups, vivid action, many thrilling moments, and the murders / attempted murders of Rains are as clever as those in the ""Columbo"" series. The picture is even more than perfect entertainment - it may be remarkable that it mixes plot and message, for many things explain how deception really works. Rains is the author and host of a murder mystery radio show - by talking about things people are interested in, he tells the truth (murderers may look like anyone else), but makes the audition keep a certain distance. We want to suspect someone of a murder by our general curiosity, and Rains gives us what we want, thus detracting from the fact that he himself is the greatest murderer of them all. His plans are executed by means of acoustics, such as edited and thereby misleading tapings of conversations. This does not only illustrate how the media work and how we all may be deceived by allegedly ""objective"" evidence, but this makes Rains' attacks even more dangerous: Means of acoustics are those of the radio, Rains' natural domain in which he is an expert of manipulation (of the masses, i.e. us, and the other characters in this movie).

The end is not to be spoiled, but Rains even uses his radio show to fulfil a last act of vanity. One has the impression that he is only living in the eye and in the ear of the other. Therefore, this picture is not only a thrilling film noir, but tells also a story about people with an empty life, suffering from complete other-directedness. Not to be watched and heard by the other is not to be. Revealing all the perverse consequences of this modern disease makes ""The Unsuspected"" as subversive as later films such as ""Peeping Tom"" (1960), which has become a classic on voyeurism. But ""The Unsuspected"" is nevertheless great entertainment - at least in the last two thirds.",1260144000,4,3577,4.739967897271268
3857837,5,B0026ZQJP2,"Another great old film that if there were justice in the world would be available remastered on a regular dvd release with extras.

In this movie, Claude Rains has a terrific voice and charisma.  But the plot of a media star who recites crime stories on radio  who  then (for money)  gets involved in one murder and then another to cover his crime is weak because he is such an obvious suspect and his alibi is easy to break.

3857857,4,B0026ZQJP2,"""The Unsuspected"" is a 1947 murder drama directed by Michael Curtiz, based on the novel of the same name by Charlotte Armstrong. The film opens as Roslyn Bright (Barbara Waddell), secretary to radio personality Victor Grandison (Claude Rains), is speaking on the telephone from Grandison's home office to Althea Keane (Audrey Totter), wife of Grandison's alcoholic nephew Oliver Keane (Hurd Hatfield). A shadow enters the room. Roslyn senses danger. She screams as she is murdered. Her death is ruled a suicide. The excitement in the Grandison household doesn't stop there. Matilda Frazier (Joan Caulfield), Grandison's beautiful niece, recently lost her life in a shipwreck. A man named Stephen Howard (Ted North) turns up on Grandison's doorstep and invites himself to stay, claiming that he and Matilda were married only 3 days before she died. No one has reason to question Howard's motives, when they find out that he's independently wealthy.

""The Unsuspected"" is often classified as ""film noir"", but it doesn't possess any strong noir elements. It's a straight ""murder drama"", as they were called at the time. The presumed villain, Victor Grandison, is over-the-top eccentrically creepy, so the real interest lies in the hostile flirtation between Althea and Stephen, both strong characters with a scheme. The character with a ""noir"" predicament is Matilda, but her plight is not written from that perspective. She never grasps what's happening to her; she's just buffeted about, seemingly no worse for the wear. The film is entertaining and eventually suspenseful. There is even a car chase at the end. It's never clear with whom we are supposed to sympathize. The strong characters, even when well-intentioned, are devious and cruel. Matilda can be pitied but not admired. I was a little surprised the film worked as well as it did considering the lack of sympathetic characters. Perhaps credit is due the director, Michael Curtiz.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2013): This is a DVD-R, so there is some concern about how long it will last. There is no scene menu, but you can navigate the film in 10-minute intervals by using the fast forward and back buttons. The print is decent but not restored, and the sound could be clearer and louder. The volume is too low. The main menu says there is a trailer, but it is just a short clip of the film's first few scenes. I wish Warner had been able to dig up a real trailer. Running time for the film is 1 hour 43 minutes. No subtitles or captioning.",1407110400,11,2498,4.959427207637232
3857858,4,B0026ZQJP2,"Another good mystery in the style of Agathe Christie.  The main character appears to be a popular, and successful, mystery story raconteur on radio.  So why does his secretary hang herself in his study? His ward suddenly returns home after apparently having been shipwrecked and lost at sea for several weeks. The wards husband suddenly appears on the scene, but she cannot remember him. Why? The police investigation into the apparent suicide of the secretary seems to stall. Who killed her and why? All good questions that make this an above average murder mystery/thriller. The film is typical of the 1950s, and perhaps a little wordy for modern tastes, but the exciting and suspenseful ending is well worth working through the plot.",1397865600,2,736,5.024590163934426

3857864,4,B0026ZQJP2,"Michael Curtiz always made movies with great visuals regardless of genre; this is an example of classic film noir cinematography at its best. The use of shadows, mirrors, and expressive lighting brings endless delights to the viewer of this suspense movie.  It seems to me the script and editing could have been a little tighter.......the first half hour was a little less clear than it could have been; but a lot of noirs are made this way and the confusion may have been part of the plan.  The last 30 minutes are really edge of your seat material, and the editing is very good in this portion of the film.

At least to me the film played as a homage to earlier noirs and suspense films........the film evokes images to me of Laura, Rebecca, Notorious, and even Dracula where the footlocker takes the place of Dracula's box.  Claude Raines was a master and could play the creepy villian role in this film in his sleep...........I really liked Michael North and Audrey Totter; I just wish Joan Fontaine could have played the rich girl in peril.

All in all this is a fun noir. It is not Out of the Past, but it is very entertaining.",1333584000,2,1133,4.507317073170731
3857865,4,B0026ZQJP2,"I agree with another reviewer who very eloquently described how confusing this noir is!  I almost gave up on it as it didn't make sense to me....and I customarily enjoy circuitous noirs like ""Somewhere in the Night"".

  Aside from the confusion, I found this picture to have the typical dark, menacing nightmare environment of noir - as if it all took place at night in a disturbing dream. The chiaroscuro is there...fine angles and shadows..etc...

  As for the DVD quality, I found it excellent. I would appreciate having the ""special features"" that some DVDs have but as long as the picture is available, then thank you, that is the important thing. The picture quality is perfect. I did notice however (and this is also true with DVDs that contain special features and all the bells and whistles) that the audio is not consistent and really not as loud as normal television would be. I have to turn my volume adjustment up all the way. But when I do, I can hear it fine. (Just wonder why I should have to do that?) Some things, like gunshots and roaring trains are too loud at this point, but the dialogue is audible.",1307404800,3,1121,4.575

The only true drawback is Joan Caulfield!  Not the best actress in the world.  Gail Russell would have been MUCH better in the role.  She had that somewhat psychotic vulnerability for which this type of role calls.

3857868,3,B0026ZQJP2,"Nothing against the movie - Its definitive a good one.

Thrilling, good photographed, great actors, including my all time favorite actor Hurd Hatfield who was always underrated. Also great Ted North (born 1916 and still somewhere in New York area...)

It's good to have this movie now on DVD. But... I don't like really the WB Archive collection. It's to expensive in my mind for a DVD-R and without any subtitles. Its hard to understand the movie for deaf hearing people.

The Picture quality of course is not the best but OK.

TRIVIA:

The radio station call letters, WMCB, were created by inserting Michael Curtiz' initials into those of Warner Bros.

Crew or equipment visible: When Steve Edwards shows up for the first time at the front door of Grandison's home, the cameraman is clearly reflected on the window of the door.

3857869,5,B0026ZQJP2,"Claude Raines can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned. Love his voise, his timing and his presence in any movie he does. I fell in love with him in Casablanca, and will watch any movie he is in. Great actor, good story line. He chews up the scenery in this movie. Great",1291507200,4,269,4.0
8353837,5,B0026ZQJP2,"Let's face it, Claude Rains is probably elegant even when he's on the crapper. He's one of my favorite character actors of all time. In 1947 he starred in THE UNSUSPECTED, a murder drama that's more suspense than mystery. We know very early on the identity of the killer, and it's Claude Rains. He plays Victor Grandison, a ""renowned writer, art collector, and teller of strange tales."" Grandison is the ""genial host"" of a popular murder mystery radio show (sponsored by United Motors Company, if you were wondering). Observe and absorb Grandison's timing and cultured elocution as he regales his rapt audience with yarns of the macabre and the sinister and of ""the calm and often smiling mask of the unsuspected.""

Perhaps he's so good at his job because he's had experience germane to the subject of homicide. For, you see, Victor Grandison is himself a murderer. In the opening scene, we bear witness as he eliminates his secretary, makes it look like a suicide, never mind that hanging one's self off a chandelier is damn elaborate and tricky thing. If only he'd stopped there, they would've had nothing on him.

For me, one more irresistible draw is Joan Caulfield whom I remember very well for her part in the sparkling, criminally underappreciated DEAR RUTH, one of my favorite comedies. But there's nothing funny in her role in THE UNSUSPECTED. She plays Matilda Frazier, beautiful heiress and Grandison's ward. Matilda is worth millions, so imagine how vigorously them vultures must've circled when it's learned she died on the freighter that burned at sea last month.

And then there's Grandison's penniless niece, Althea Keane (Audrey Totter), who resides on Matilda's grand estate, along with her uncle. Upon learning of Matilda's passing, Althea promptly demonstrates she's no sentimental sob sister. She wastes no time moving into Matilda's bedroom.

One by one, we're introduced to the other participants in this murder drama. The only one left whom I've still to mention is Steven Howard (Michael North). Howard, probably more than any other character, is responsible for driving the narrative. He fosters his own hidden agenda. But who in this movie isn't?

Well, I guess Matilda isn't. She's the most uncomplicated person in this story, and the most oblivious, and, therefore, the most uninteresting. The movie makes it so that her resting mood is that being perpetually distraught. Good thing Caulfield is such a stunning looker.

Honestly, the two most interesting characters are Grandison and Althea, courtesy of Rains and Trotter' knack for adroit habitation of their roles. I already knew Rains was the consummate performer, with his velvet voice, flawless urbanity, and unflappable pulse lending a chilling element to his being the serial murderer. But it's Audrey Totter who knocked my socks off with how catty and loose-moraled and disillusioned and brittle she was. Whenever she was on screen, it was seriously entertaining. Althea Keane made it her mission to each time be the life of the party. The poor girl, it's her way of compensating for what she lacks: money, love, companionship, self-worth... Anyway, Totter is terrific.

It's expertly directed by Michael Curtiz. He makes it effortless to keep up with the twists and turns of the plot - and there's a heap of twists and turns. Just because we already know who the killer is doesn't mean we still can't be kept biting our nails, nerves all jangled up.

I have two nitpicks in what otherwise would be a flawless film. One is that I didn't quite buy the romance that springs up and felt that it required more screen time to develop. The other is that it seemed to me that Grandison's stooge panicked for no reason. All guy had to do was stay calm and drive normally and he would've gotten away okay.

And there's always a twin frisson of nostalgia and, I dunno, regret that surges thru me when I watch these old movies and I see things that aren't around anymore. Case in point, the Pan American World Airways jet that Matilda boards. I remember PanAm! Anyway, great cat-and-mouse movie.",1527292800,,4072,4.950219619326501

Highly recommended.",1520726400,,158,4.888888888888889
8353839,5,B0026ZQJP2,"I enjoyed this film a lot. I think that Claude Raines performed masterfully. The ads about the film reveal that the man played by Rains is a murderer. But we do not know why or how he did it. So the film is filled with mystery, suspense, and intrigue. I think that Raines acted masterfully in the film from the beginning to the end.
The intrigue revolves not only around Raines but the rich young woman, played beautifully by Joan Caulfield, who is given top billing, for whom he is a guardian. She was in a ship-wreak and was presumed dead. But as some time passes, it is discovered that she is still alive. She was rescued but the ship that saved her had no radio. She is met when she returned by a man who tells her that he is her husband. She says she has no memory of ever meeting him. He is not saying what he is saying to get her money because he is also very rich. He proves that he is her husband when he takes her to a restaurant where a waiter says he recognized her as the mans wife. He also takes her to the judge he says married them and the judge assures her that he did so. This man came to Raines house before it was revealed that she is alive. We wonder why he did so.
Also, before coming home, after she apparently died, the man she loved and who loved her married Raines niece, a marriage that did not work out well, and he became a drunk. We do not know why he married the niece.
An assistant of Raines is found dead before this woman comes home. She was hung. It is an apparent suicide. Raines seems to have an alibi.",1509580800,,1539,4.082508250825082

8353841,5,B0026ZQJP2,"Terrific film noir. Great light and cinematography. If you're a Claude Rains fan like me you will most certainly enjoy him in this role. He is magnificent as always. Audrey Totter is also great in a supporting role. Im basing my review off a TCM viewing, not the dvd but i will likely purchase it and add my thoughts on the quality of the dvd. Wish they would put it on blu ray tho",1508716800,,381,4.162162162162162
8353842,5,B0026ZQJP2,"I love films of the 30 & 40s. I am talking mostly of the 'b' movies. They did a great job with what was on hand: actors, scripts, sets, locations, etc. They did not go overboard with huge names, drawn out scripts, locales, etc. This is a perfect addition to any library.",1508025600,,270,4.211538461538462
