Listen here, I bought this movie out of curiosity and mostly because it was 3.99 at Sam Goodies Clearance Bin in about 06ish. Well before ever watching this film I always look at the back cover. The cover art is sort of boring and there was atleast 4 warnings on the box saying MUST BE 18 TO WATCH.By the way I was 14 when I bought this at sam's Goodies and no one gave me stick about it. SO i pop the dvd in and there 2 FBI WARNINGS saying that IF COPIED THINGS WILL HAPPEN AND SUCH.  Then at the same moment there are these doctors in the background working on what looks like a brain it just plain freaky. Honstly the first time I watched it I only watched about 35 mins before I just stopped it cause of the freakyness ( such as a man falling from a building,Alien Autopsy,Man getting head blown off by a maginum revolver,and the scarest thing was these weird surgiries first cause there was no sound to it, and secondly it look so damn real. I mean I've seen beasteyalogy on film,rare realistic underground horror films that only a handful of people know. But after viewing it a second time it really was scary but the quality of the video is junk in the begging of the video I noticed that a company called Flatline Productions made this video on a VHS tape in 2000 (do I smell lawsuit in the future). And because of this VHS copied to a dvd quality you'll get the loud buzzy noise time to time. Now to me I wouldn't recommend this DVD TO ANYONE. The only reason I could see someone watch this DVD is out of couriosty and even then it's pretty awful. Now I cant comment on this film on other people's vision of this I watched this film 2 years ago and I will never forget the frightful experience and that my friends is my review and why I give it 2 stars!",1265673600,3,1830,4.140449438202247
