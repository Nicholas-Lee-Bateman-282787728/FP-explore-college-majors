8400309,4,B003M987SS,"I know this video is of fair quality at best, but the performance is great. This is the first video I have seen of this band (I have ordered the other 1973 concert DVDs) and it was neat to see the guitarists. The picture is not always bad and the sound is acceptable for what it is. I did not see Miles live until 1981, so this is jazz history for me. I give five stars to the music and three stars to the video quality, hence the four star rating.",1364083200,,448,3.934065934065934
8400310,4,B003M987SS,"Others have given this video a poor rating based on the very poor quality of the recording.
I used to and still do maintain that I'd rather hear Caruso on a scratchy old 78 than Madonna in crisp bigger-than-real-life stereo recording.
This is why I give this video a high rating.
There are relatively few video disks out there of Miles pre-1980.  Add to that that this 1973 performance refreshingly contains some tunes that are not heard on a lot of the other videos out there from this period (thankfully there's not yet another rendition of 'willie' on this disk)..
So, yes the quality is poor but it's worth it to me to have the recording for the music that's on it.  It's not like we can go ask Mr. Davis if he'd like to re-record it.",1352764800,,738,4.37956204379562
8400311,1,B003M987SS,"I should have listened to these other reviews, but i didnt. Instead, i went to you Tube, and looked up this concert. For anyone thinking of doing the same, let me warn you. You tube has some of this concert, (less than 2 minutes) that is A+ grade sourced directly from the Stockholm TV broadcast video, which ultimately was the source of this DVD. Judging from the superior quality of the source broadcast, i can tell you right now from my own experience collecting VHS bootlegs of rare concert broadcasts, this DVD is copied at best off a third generation tape. I suspect that someone copied this concert's original Swedish TV2 broadcast, onto VHS Tape. What third generation means, is a vhs copy of a vhs copy of the original vhs recording of the Swedish TV broadcast, is what was used to manufacture this DVD. If this video were being sold at a tape-trader convention, it would be labeled C minus grade, with degraded sound and picture quality. (The picture quality is so bad, that behind the image blurs, and constant snowy edges, the colors are extremely faded, and bleed far off their edges. Hideous.) The sound quality is every bit as horrible as the picture quality. Again, hearing the original copy of the broadcast video off you tube, lets you hear how muted, hissy, buzzy and distorted the sound is. Honestly, you are hearing only about 50% of what is on the original video. If i paid less than $4 for this at a convention, i would still feel ripped off and cheated. I think that Amazon should remove this product, and whoever produced these dvds for public sale, should be sued by the Miles Davis estate. I'm serious.

Right now, there are so many other Miles dvds that are professionally produced, that you shouldn't throw your money away on something so pathetically poor, its not watchable. I suggest purchasing the Stadthalle Vienna DVD concert, recorded one week later during Mile's 1973 European tour. Also, this 1973 band is found on the Montreaux Jazz festival 'Best of' DVD. (If you wish to buy the whole box set of 10 DVDs from Miles' complete festival performances, you would have a complete 1973 concert also, in pristine vision.) So, trust these reviews. LIVE IN STOCKHOLM 1973 is unwatchable, and not worth owning just for collecting reasons. Lets wait until that day, when Sweden's TV2 broadcast video master is used to create a watchable version. Sadly, even with all the distortion, buzzing, hiss, muted and blurred sounds, you can still see its a well filmed concert utilizing 3 cameras, cross fades and excellent close ups. However, that's what galls me; knowing there's enough ""Mile's Magic"" left on even this pathetic, ruined document of the original video broadcast, to discern a truly excellent show.",1320278400,8,2735,4.806794055201698
8400312,2,B003M987SS,"Classic Miles from the early 70s but both the sound quality and picture quality are very poor.  Looks as if someone put a videocam in front of a TV screen and recorded a live TV broadcast.  Consists four tracks of 56 minutes:

1. Untitled Original
2. Caylpso Frelimo
3. For Dave [Mr. Foster]
4. Tune In

This DVD is only for collectors and historians.",1277942400,12,351,4.4375
