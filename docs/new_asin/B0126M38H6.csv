7343027,4,B0126M38H6,"I'm not going to go over the details of the series.  This is a love it-then-hate-it-then-kinda-like-it-a-little-more-than-you-used-to-but-never-as-much-as-when-things-were-new-and-fresh-and-great sort of show.  Nothing in the series tops season one, everyone knows that.  How about the product itself?  It's a relatively rote package that doesn't do much to celebrate the show.  It was pretty obviously released to entice people to buy this based on the new Heroes:Reborn season.  It worked on me.  Durn you, advertising gods!!

I paid way more than I should have, but these days it's a good price for the set.",1448409600,10,610,5.7
7343028,5,B0126M38H6,Arrived as described.,1447632000,,21,6.333333333333333
7343029,2,B0126M38H6,Glad I got it elsewhere for 49.00 and not at this price. The packaging is horrid. I ended up buying two 9 disk blu-ray cases to hold all 4 seasons and tossed the rest of the packaging in the trash. Doesn't seem like they made much effort in converting over to blu-ray. Picture quality and sound are not much different than the DVD. If you can get it at a discounted price it's ok. Not worth at the current price here.,1446163200,7,417,4.160493827160494
7343030,3,B0126M38H6,"I didn't buy this set on Amazon, but this is my honest review about it.
I'm a huge fan of Heroes and I was looking forward to get this package.
However, I couldn't be more surprised when I opened it.
Turns out that somebody had the clever idea of ""recycling"" all the old Blu-Ray packages from individual seasons, put on a big beautiful box (that wasn't damaged on shipping!), and then sell it as brand new products. THIS IS A JOKE. The individual seasons aren't even 100% pristine, the discs are, but the paper/carton parts of the ""digipak"" package are all damaged on the corners, one of the Blu-Rays was even loose from its compartment, which evidences the reuse of said packages.
I was also hoping for a Digital HD release along with the new package. Got frustrated again, as there are only the Blu-Rays and that's all you'll get.
If NBC wanted to promote Heroes Reborn with this package, they failed miserably, as the original Heroes series is great, but this Blu-Ray set DEFINITELY isn't.",1445644800,5,992,4.642045454545454
7343031,1,B0126M38H6,"Just a word of warning about this set: I received my copy only to be disappointed that the inner content was obviously repackaged old stock in a new box. The outer box itself is made of flimsy cardboard (more like paper) with top and bottom tuck-in flaps that will likely tear off after opening-and-closing a few times. The four individual season DigiPaks had their original outer sleeves removed, but each exhibited nasty corner wear, scuffing, and one had a tear on the spine that caused the back panel to become almost separated. I don't know why, but I expected Universal would have packaged this release in the sturdier outer box used for most of their other complete-series releases. This is another disappointing release that will be going back for a refund rather than replacement.",1444780800,13,789,4.895522388059701
7343032,2,B0126M38H6,"Also, how do you call this The Complete Series when the Heroes: Reborn mini series is still on the air. At least wait till it's over.",1444694400,,133,4.153846153846154
7343033,4,B0126M38H6,"This is only getting a re-release due to Universal's Heroes Reboot this Fall
This box set is shameless to say the least (You can already buy the Region Free UK Box Set Cheaper! If you must have this series in a box set That would be the wise choice) If you don't care about having a overly big Box that probably won't fit in your blu ray Collection
Just get the ""Original"" Blu Ray's Season by Season (you can get each season for around $12.00 give or take
all the extras from the original BR's seem to be carried over to this new set
the only new thing is the box art (If this is the official box art it's plain and looks rushed)
This Box Set is super over priced for a series that's been off Network tv for 5 years

The Series itself had it's up and down's
Season One/Volume 1  (Genesis) was close to flawless you seen so much limitless potential
It was also the longest Season within the 4 seasons
Season Two/Volume 2  (Generations)  on the other hand was broken and short due to  the Writers Guild of America strike @ the time
This strike effected a handful of great New Properties in the long run  Two NBC's programs come to mind  Life  &  Journeyman
Season two lost all the magic season one introduced everything was disjointed you could tell by the end of Season two
This Series would Never fully recover and return to what made season one great

Season Three/Volume  3  (Villains)
  Volume 4 (Fugitives)  This season was broke into two parts which helped smooth out the story line but, with every two step forwards there are two steps backwards

Season Four/Volume Five: Redemption The Final Season actually very good close to season one but, it had no Real Conclusion to any of the main characters  no type of closer

I haven't watch this series since it first aired on NBC
Have all 4 BR's but, haven't had time to crack 'em open and re-watch them again
It's no way bad but,, it's also no way amazing people at the time bought into all the hype surrounding it
This was Pushed and Promoted like crazy NBC seemed to have put all there eggs in one basket  with these series
It was a blessing and a curse
NBC was ahead of the ""whole"" comic book adaption thing 3-4 years ahead of everyone else They didn't buy licensing rights from Marvel or DC Comics they created there own universe and new charters  (very smart)
to many people romanticize this series! @ times it was close to flawless but, it also had terrible problems and after Season One was never really consistent ever again
This creation was it's own worst enemy
But, it's still one of the better shows in the past 15 years
The Complete Series of Heroes is without a doubt a solid  9/10
Just save your money and don't buy a over priced box set",1437868800,17,2705,4.359281437125748

7343035,3,B0126M38H6,I could have liked it a lot more but there were so many abrupt changes in the script and timeline that it got very confusing.  Probably explains why I stopped watching the broadcast version and waited for the DVD set.,1523491200,,217,4.425

The dvds played well, but I should say that the cover labels were wrinkled and there were some broken off plastic pieces from the case, one piece of which helps hold a disc in place, but seems to be staying in anyway.

7343053,2,B0126M38H6,"First, I hate how people review movies and TV shows like this is Rotten Tomatoes...  This just isn't the place for that type of review!  My review applies to the quality and condition of the product, price, shipping...

I put this collection on my watch list months ago...  I was waiting for it to drop below $20.  I read the relevant reviews that warned about damaged cases, but couldn't pass up this 21-disc collection when it finally dropped to just under $22.

When it arrived (on time with Prime/2-day) I almost didn't open it, because the thin paper box was dented in several places, every corner was damaged/rounded, and 3 of the plastic cases were obviously shattered.  Considering each disc was only about a dollar, I decided to open the worst case first.  It had several hinged plastic pages that were completely unattached and cracked...  tiny pieces of plastic were everywhere...  Long story short, every plastic case was damaged from slightly to comical, but the discs all looked fine.  Other reviewers warned me about the probable damage, but I paid significantly less than a pristine box from a traditional store and the seller shipped quickly.  I may buy a few new empty cases, but (overall) Im happy with no regrets.  In my opinion, low price and functioning discs > pristine plastic cases.  Each of the paper sleeves were fine.  Just the plastic cases and thick paper box was trashed.",1517616000,5,1402,4.807531380753138

7343066,3,B0126M38H6,"This review may be premature since I just watched season 1 and just started season 2.  I will give you my impression now and update later if my opinion changes.  The good thing is the story line is somewhat unpredictable.  One bad thing is that there are many main characters and they are constantly switching to another set of characters.  The first few episodes it was really bad but over time I am either getting used to it or they are not switching as much.  I am thinking they are not switching as much because the number of main characters in each episode is fewer.  Another bad thing is that it is one big long story.  I prefer TV shows where the episodes are more or less independent.  Another bad thing, from my point of view, is that some Hollywood liberal is trying paint a world from their point of view.  What do the following characteristics have in common (drug addict, cheat on wife and have illegitimate child, get in accident and make wife crippled, cheat on wife again, selfish drama queen, fat policemen that cannot get promoted in 3 tries, fat policemen commits a crime, serious villain that kills a bunch of people, a drunk, plus others) > white males.  The cast is very diverse and other groups (except the Asians) are portrayed more favorably.  I joked to my wife about the diversity and I told her they forgot the Hispanics.  Well in season 2 we get Hispanics.
Now I am starting season 3.  The fact that story never ends kind of gets frustrating like having sex and not being able to finish.  To keep making stories they use time travel to create new timelines.  It starts getting confusing.  The strong point, as always, is what happens is usually unpredictable.  In these later episodes, using the different timelines, which characters are good and which are bad changes.  Kind of like driving home the point that good guys can be bad and bad guys can be good.  In these later episodes the white bashing is less often or maybe I am getting used to it.  They are merciless to the Asians and make them look like buffoons and silly children.  The Indian scientist keeps making bad choices.
Here I am starting season 4.  I forgot to mention earlier when I commented on all the diversity that they forgot LBGT characters.  Well in season 4 we get a woman who loves women and kisses Claire on the lips (for a while!).  On top of that, not only does Claire not totally reject the kiss but says she is not sure what to think.  I think they also snuck in another one.  Claire's mother looks suspiciously masculine and from the back the mother kind of looks like a football player.
The best thing about the show is the Sylar character, Zachary Quinto (Spock on Star Trek), who says things which although evil, are funny.  Many of the later episodes with him in it are really good.  If you buy these DVDs for no other reason, I would buy them just to watch Zachary as Sylar.

I will update as needed but my gut feel is that this long story is going to get tiresome someday.",1496188800,,2989,4.45303867403315

The outside box of the Heroes case was also crunched a little as well, but again that's not that big of a deal to me. Long as all the DVD's are all in good shape and play well, I'll be happy enough.
 I did notice in the 3rd season DVD, there was one area on the disk where the audio and video were not in sync like it should be, But not sure if that is a problem with the DVD, a fluke, or possibly my equipement?

As you have definitely read about this dvd collection from other reviewers (and title Ive written, obviously), I happen to get the same treatment. Most of the cases came a bit damaged, except for Season 3s box( for the worst). Only the first and sixth discs were in the box, all scratched up by the way. With the pictures Ive provided, you can see the box has Skips + Stops written in sharpie. Someone,somewhere knew these two dvds were no good and still sold them. Is honesty a rare thing these days? Could I buy honesty? Can I get the respect for just being a human being? .........No, fine.

There are no DVDs in there. I haven't yet check on Seasons 3 and 4 yet. I mean, I know its the worst season of the bunch, but I still paid for (and wanted) the complete set.

About the show, season two is a hot mess, but for the most part, Heroes as a whole is pretty amazing.",1524268800,,433,3.9204545454545454
