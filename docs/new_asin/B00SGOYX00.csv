8698298,5,B00SGOYX00,"Unlike most American television shows, there is a real story behind this series.  The show isn't shot on a one room set and there's a lot of attention to detail, from the settings to the costumes.  In the end, it's a love story.  And it's played out well by the lead actors, Eddie Peng, Lui Shi Shi, and Hu Ge.  This is my first foray into Asian film, and I was pleasantly surprised to find myself really engrossed in this show.

As expected, this PAL version cannot be played in my US DVD player, but plays fine on my computer with my DVD drive.  It works even better with my external DVD drive though.  I also use Cyberlink Power DVD to play it.",1438646400,,647,4.211382113821138

8698300,5,B00SGOYX00,"I love historical dramas often however because of the events in history the writers of a drama are limited with the romantic aspect .History
is not always romantic and does not always end as we would like. This drama gives us history with romance as well as great scenes in the Gobi dessert which many of us would never otherwise see. It is also filled with amazing costumes of the period even dessert people had a great sense of style in this drama. If you are a romantic and like Asian history this is the drama to watch. The story is complicated ,yet simple a woman , two men and still a fairly happy ending, who could ask for more? I enjoyed it and will probably watch it again in future. Just a word of advice of you do not understand Chinese you have to follow story carefully to get all the meaning subtitles are ok but loosely translated.
This clearly a great find.",1423440000,3,873,4.329268292682927
8698301,5,B00SGOYX00,"Story takes place during the Han dynasty with the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (156 - 87 BC).  The Han daynasty is considered to be China's golden age as China's majority ethnic group to this date still continues to refer themselves as the ""Han people"".

Jin Yu surpasses in both intelligence and beauty but her time with the Xiongnu ends with the tragic death of her adopted father during internal coup d'tat among the Xiongnu.  She reverts back to her wolves for a time period before she decides she needs to live among people of her own origin.  This takes her to the Han capital city of Chang'an, where her fate crosses paths with two powerful men.  With one being the soft spoken mysterious master of Shi Manor, Mo Xun and the other is the handsome but impetuous rising general, Wei Wu Ji.
