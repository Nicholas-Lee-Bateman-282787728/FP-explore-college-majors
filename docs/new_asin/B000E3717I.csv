It was informative; however, more carrier history and more details about the Essex class aircraft carriers would have made it better. The dramatic reenactments and (modern) music were okay. This documentary was short; after removing the beginning and ending credits, it was about 40 minutes in length. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm not sure if I would watch it again.

8285315,5,B000E3717I,"This fine video produced by the History Channel documents the growth of the American carrier task force in the Pacific.  After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December, 1941, the American Pacific Fleet was left with just three carrier groups.  These centered on the carriers Enterprise, Lexington, and Hornet.  But these groups proved their mettle in the fight against the Japanese by stiking at Japanese bases in the Marshall and Gilbert islands, and the Enterprise and Hornet groups led the famous Doolittle raid against Tokyo in April, 1945.

However, the real tests came at the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway in the spring of 1942.  These battles turned the tide against the Japanese, but the Americans also suffered losses of their own.  After these battles, it became clear that the war in the Pacific would be won by the aircraft carrier.  Thus, the United States launched a massive campaign to build the biggest, fastest, and best carriers the world had ever seen.  These were the Essex class carriers.

At over 800 feet long and carrying almost 100 combat aircraft, the Essex carriers were the best carriers ever produced.  By the end of the war, the United States had commissioned over 15 of these ships.  They were ultimately responsible for the final death of the Imperial Japanese navy.  The Japanese never produced any carrier class even remotely close to the Essex ships.  And, with the great American industrial capability, it became only a matter of time before the Japanese were overwhelmed.

I was gratly impressed with the quality of this video.  The story of carrier combat in the Pacific is brilliantly described, both from an American and Japanese point of view.  The color images are striking to see, and the testimony from officers who actually served aboard the Essex carriers gives a human side to the story.  Each battle of the Pacific war and the impact the carriers had on its outcome is described in detail, and the combat sequences add great authenticity to the story.

I highly recommend this fine video.  The story is captivating, the color images are vivid, and the crewmembers' stories are riviting.  Watch this exciting video and see how the Essex class carriers played a major role in the defeat of Japan.",1161129600,,2255,4.899736147757256
