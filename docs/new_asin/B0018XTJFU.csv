8271369,5,B0018XTJFU,"Wonderful and little known comedy starring James Stewart and Ginger Rogers.  If you are familiar with Ms. Roger's work in either Bachelor Mother or the Major and the Minor and you enjoyed those movies, you will undoubtedly be delighted with this movie.  If you enjoyed Mr. Stewart in You Can't Take it With You, you will probably greatly enjoy this film.

One of my personal favorite comedy classics along with Bringing Up Baby and Arsenic and Old Lace.

A multi-region DVD player will be required to play this movie, but it is well worth it.

You can catch a few clips from this delightful film on You Tube.",1314835200,2,608,4.592592592592593
