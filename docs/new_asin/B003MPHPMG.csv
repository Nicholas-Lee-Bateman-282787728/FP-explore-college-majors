8400434,3,B003MPHPMG,"Fonda has suffered through her last abusive relationship when she receives an elixir from a New Age holistic medicine woman, an elixir that summons all of her rage and anguish into the demon Enyo. Enyo goes on to seduce and eliminate each of the men that caused Fonda harm, but once they have each been killed, what will it take to stop Enyo's murderous rampage? While its tiny budget is clearly evidenced in much of the film's acting and production, MANHATER makes an honest effort to mask its limitations with ambitious effects and a strong social conscious. Few Horror entries have attempted to tackle the issue of domestic abuse head on, let alone in such a violent manner. MANHATER includes a great deal of bloodshed, nudity, and savagery that is contextualized into the plot rather than becoming gratuitous. One can't help but notice a hint of irony in the fact that the film condemns domestic violence yet depicts numerous scenes of graphic gore, but those who are willing to suspend disbelief will revel in the carnage on screen. As a unique revenge film that crosses the Southern Gothic classic PUMPKINHEAD with Eastern influences like JU-ON, MANHATER is able to mold its heavy theme into a workable Horror movie.
