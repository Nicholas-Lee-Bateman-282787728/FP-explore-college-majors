8325645,5,B000Q9R45Y,"Being a fan of Keali'i Reichel and his Hawaiian renditions of song and the Hula, I was thrilled to find this VHS tape (previously owned) on Amazon.  It was filmed at Honolulu's Waikiki Shell during a performance in 1996, within a year or two of his first CD. While at times it is difficult to understand what he is saying as the sound is not the greatest (outdoor performance), it is still entertaining and fun to watch his interaction with the audience and the other performers who join him on stage.  Great mix of old and new songs as well as chants.  A great addition and keepsake for all of us who love Hawaii and Keali'i  Reichel's music. Highly recommended!  You will enjoy!",1376784000,,680,4.495934959349594
