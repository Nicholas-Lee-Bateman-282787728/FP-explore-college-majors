7866279,2,6304252129,"Loaded (Anna Campion, 1994)

Anna Campion is the older sister of Jane Campion. Jane is a noted, and notable, director (Sweetie, The Piano, etc.). Anna directed only a single feature film, 1994's Bloody Weekend, re-released under the name Loaded. It would be, for many reasons and not all of them related to the respective genres the two sisters worked in, ridiculous to compare this film to anything Jane Campion ever did. But that comparison, wanted and warranted or not, hangs over Loaded at every turn, and I cannot claim that it did not color my judgment here. Your mileage, as always, may varythough judging by the film's 4.7 IMDB rating (as of March 2014) and woeful score at Rotten Tomatoes (they do not do percentages until a certain threshold of review has been reached, but the movie has no fresh reviews and four rotten ones as of this writing), it probably won't.

Plot: Seven young-and-beautifuls (whose ranks include Thandie Newton, Catherine MacCormack, Oliver Milburn, and a couple of other faces you are likely to recognize twenty years later) head off into the British countryside to make a movie. It is ambitious, well-meaning, and impossibly bad. Things start off all right, but tempers start fraying for various real and imagined slights. Then someone breaks out the LSD.

I have read at least one review of this film expressing confusion at where the title came from. I'm not sure how that's possible, considering that my biggest problem with this movie, as it is with so many movies of this stripe, is that Campion, who also wrote, uses drugs as a plot device. For me, that's pretty much instant failure in a screenplay. The movie was already headed downhill, and it felt (as it so often does) like the writer used it as a desperation move. That it immediately transforms the movie into a morality play is a given, and from there the outcome is assured. Predictability, however, is only the surface symptom of the disease that riddles the scriptit didn't know where it was going. Some decent acting by the cast, but they didn't have anything worth acting to work with. **",1401580800,,2094,4.811111111111111
7866280,3,6304252129,Good cast with Thandie but not enough of her in the movie.  I watched it a few times and give it three stars because it can be a little boring at times.,1237420800,,152,3.75
7866281,2,6304252129,"This bizzare tale of the filming of a horror movie  left me feeling empty and dissapointed.  The plot had many chances to thicken, but it never does.  The actors do as best they can, but the script is poorly written.  Many  details begin to come up, but they are left in midair with no completion.  This movie had many holes, but many attractive and talented actors in it.",947462400,7,372,4.397058823529412
7866282,4,6304252129,"Loaded is an average, run of the mill first film. While the writing is so-so, Anna's direction shows she has some talent.  As with most freshman films, it's not quite polished but it does indicate Anna has potential as a  filmmaker. What makes this film enjoyable are the performances by Thandie  Newton and Catherine McCormack. These two Brits demonstrate their acting  talent and really make the film worth watching. I gave this film four stars  for the acting -- that's what carried Loaded.",926640000,4,493,4.891566265060241
