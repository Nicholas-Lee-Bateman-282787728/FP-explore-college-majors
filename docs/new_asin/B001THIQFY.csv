8341411,1,B001THIQFY,I bought this over a month ago but didn't have a chance to watch till last night & the Mallrats disc is horrible. Has some blue bar through the top of the screen for the whole movie & it was not removable via settings. Very disappointing because it's too late to return it.,1490400000,,273,4.169811320754717
