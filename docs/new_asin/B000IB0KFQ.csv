8144680,5,B000IB0KFQ,"I highly recommend any DVD presented by Richard Smith.  I have them all, and he covers techniques that you're not likely to see in any other presentation.  This DVD focuses on R & B playing, which didn't interest me at first- I thought I was getting a lesson on different strumming styles.  Instead, Smith lasers in on all sorts of techniques that you wouldn't expect: one being ""bubble"" picking.  Another technique he calls ""funnies.""  Really, you have to see this guy in action to understand his complete mastery of modern electric guitar playing.  Buy just one of them.  You'll probably get 'em all, just like I did.",1315785600,,619,4.728971962616822
