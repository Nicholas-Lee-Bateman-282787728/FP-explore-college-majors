Tremendous cast, cutting script, and excellent use of locations. In some ways, this miniseries was ahead of its time.  Great to see Andy Griffith cast against type here.

5089549,5,B007ISJS8M,"Although not identified as such, this is a chilling account of a president ( one can assume Nixon) and his paranoia running the  United States during his mandate. The similarities are too striking with Richard Nixon not to see that this portrail is a cardon copy of Mr. Nixon's presidency. The arrogance and disregard for anything honorable and decent is what is shown here and the cast does a marvellous job in their respective assignments. Jason Robards and Robert Vaughn  steal the entire show when they are on the screen and there is just enough of several actual incidents for the period to bring home the reality of it all. Although this was shown on television over 30 years ago the same can hold true today. View this striking account of a presidency gone haywire to realise that history can repeat itself. A must see for all history buffs of the American Presidential Political System.

It's all the Watergate story so it's not impossible to guess the ending but it's the story of the journey which is the magic part. A cast of stars - more distinguished than in most feature films - is possibly led by the great Jason Robards as the ""President"". Most if not all the names are changed to protect the guilty, but that's  a big part of the fun - trying to remember who's who, and what they did !

5089551,5,B007ISJS8M,"This is an excellent, albeit terrifying, dramatic parallel to the Nixon administration. Since I was living out of the country at that time, I didn't fully ""feel"" the impact it wrought, but this film really drives the point home retroactively.  It seems strange that John Ehrlichman would have written such a revealing story, when he was an integral part of the hypocrisy that regime carried out.

Yes, a few situations were altered, but the frightening background was quite factual.  Jason Robards, Cliff Robertson, and Robert Vaughn, among others, turned out their customary outstanding performances.  You could say that the ""lovey'dovey"" affairs were a bit overdone throughout the entire miniseries.  Nevertheless, each of the various husband-wife-mistress messes was influenced by the political turmoil surrounding the characters.

What amazes me is how a country could elect and re-elect such a man, considering the degree of disrespect evidenced by the public, so vividly described on screen.  We clearly had to be asleep at the switch.  I can well remember that just before Nixon's second election, Ralph Nader described his administration as being the most corrupt administation in U.S. history.  Although hardly anyone apparently listened, this was soon to be proven correct.

I honestly feel that what I'm writing here is not overmingling fiction with fact.  This was a story that needed to be told, and has been done so far more clearly than the film Nixon managed to achieve -- without mentioning specific names, yet coming mighty close syllable-wise.

If a movie studio should choose to produce a film describing Nazi Germany in its heyday, they wouldn't have to do much more than modify this one's script a bit and change the setting from Washington to Berlin.",1364083200,,1773,5.204225352112676

It was great. Its a characterization of the Nixon years. I think its a must for anyone who wants to see the inside story of the Nixon white house. If you can get past the late 70's look, the mini-series is excellent. The story moves along, the characters are good and the acting is good for the time.

Odd that my favourite characters in this series were the two presidents - Anderson and Monckton - and the chief of staff, Frank Flaherty. The others are great, but Griffiths, Robards and Vaughn are just so malevolent in their own special ways and project their on-screen personalities so powerfully that you just can't wait for them to do or say something real MEAN again.

Pay phones-NO cells; no deleted expletives; VHS tape surveillance technology; and the film look of the late 70s--early 80s but its datedness is quickly forgotten THEN seen as a period political series with set-costume historic perfection. I lived the Nixon years (actually voted for him, OUCH!) This is powerful. Made me mad all over again, but also expect a compelling drive all the way to the 3 DVDs' end.
SUBTITLES for all 6 feature-length episodes.

One dialogue quote sums it up: ""It's just so vicious. There's so much back-biting and insincerity."" Perhaps too true in an election year. You may opt to stay away from the voter booth in favor of another viewing for this adaptation of Ehrlichman's book. Everyone knows the book and this series was about Nixon and Watergate. Author Ehrlichman was part of it. Like Haldeman, portrayed perfectly by Robert Vaughn under the fiction name of Flaherty, they did 18 months of jail time. Both the real man and Vaughn inspire disgust of politicians. Also giving such an astonishingly perfect performance that it makes a voter want to puke, was Nicholas Prior as Hank, anything-to-get-ahead boot-licker. And you'll be spitting nails at the see-saw politics of the CIA Director (Cliff Robertson plays Martin, but it was Helms in real Nixon life). Plenty of other stars like Jason Robards playing `Tricky Dick',President. I'm surprised congress didn't investigate the actor after the series, like they did the president--that convincing. Oh and who'd have thought Andy Griffith could play such a nasty former-Pres ESA (really LBJ)? Easy to spot Tessler (Harold Gould), or the real Kissinger, with German accent and dark frame glasses.

Unfortunately, some really good acting by female leads of Stephanie Powers, Frances Lee McCain, Lois Nettleton, Meg Foster, and Lara Parker but Ehrlichman's book and the film script left all women looking like they served no purpose in DC other than sex objects and arm candy...wait, what's changed? Politics as usual, almost. It's not Disney!

I remember refusing to read the books put out by the Nixon political crooks, didn't think they should benefit financially for what they did to the USA citizens. I did watch this ABC series. Good DVD to revisit. After 35 years this series appears to be a documentary for those of us who lived it, a history lesson for younger generations, and a lesson never learned by DC.

5089557,5,B007ISJS8M,"I first watched this mini-series on British TV some years ago, and found it riveting.  Having since enjoyed the film ""The American President"" and the entire West Wing series, I think Washington Behind Closed Doors was the first of these political dramas, showing the behind the scenes jockeying for position, power and privilege.  But it was shown at a time just before most of us in the West began to doubt and mistrust most of our political ""leaders"", so it was in some ways quite shocking at the time.  But it was also funny, sometimes hilariously so.  Nicholas Pryor springs immediately to mind as a young man desperate to climb the greasy political pole, but a man also greatly lacking in confidence, someone who would behave as though he were a lord of creation when things were going well for him, but who disintegrated into a wimpish, snivelling, sweating wreck when he saw his golden future disappearing in front of his eyes.  It is a truly great performance.  Robert Vaughn,in full Machiavellian mode,usually cut him down to size in no time at all, browbeating, intimidating and blackmailing everyone into following his instructions, and a first rate job he made of it, too.

Jason Robards made a wonderfully shifty, devious and underhand President.  Cliff Robertson and Stefanie Powers were also in the cast, along with a dark-haired actress with hypnotically blue eyes, name of Meg, but I can't remember whether that was her character's name, or the first name of the actress playing her.  I believe I read somewhere that she had been auditioned for one of the lead parts in ""Cagney and Lacey"", and was in fact in the pilot of that show, but subsequently replaced for the series.

5089561,5,B007ISJS8M,"Why does Monckton (Nixon) say ""I'll take it"" in the TV aired series, but here he just walks off without answering? Fantastic!, 1 Feb. 2015

This review is from: Washington: Behind Closed Doors [DVD] [1977] [Region 1] [US Import] [NTSC] (DVD)

Created in 1977 in the flames of the presidential scandal that was still unfolding with the ""pardoning"" of Nixon by Ford this series is a white hot prime time lavish concotion featuring a rosta of acting talent, sharp dialogue and slick screen play.

It's a great dramatization of a somewhat fanciful narrative loosely based on facts and real events by the Nixon aide John Erhlichman. In particular the extremely red blooded flamboyant characterisation of Nixon given by Jason Robards has to be taken with a pinch of salt, however watchable and charismatic. Similarly the emergence of a smoking gun in terms of a bundle of evidence implicating the White House in illegal goings on, that the harassed Director of the CIA - Cliff Roberston - confronts the President with in the final episode, on the eve of Nixon's landslide 1972 re-election, in order to secure his own retirement to a safe post overseas somewhere ""not too heavy"" - again this treatment of the CIA by Nixon, or mutual antagonism has no basis in fact.

This final showdown is followed rather closely by the film adaptation here, except in these points: the book gives Martin the CIA Director as finally divorcing his long suffering wife (who is drawn non too sympathetically in this film) and shacking up with in paradise with his lover Stefanie Powers (who has also been a useful tool in his machinations as well as bit on the side) but in the film there appears to be a reconciliation, and that is they way he bows out. Nevertheless, Cliff Robertson gives a masterly performance of a charscter with few if any redeeming features: ""I had to replace a few enemies with a few friends"". A cursory newspaper article indicates that there will be trouble ahead, but ""he"" is ""out"" of it. However, in the book, he says quite clearly that a long fuse has been lit which will burn right up to him. Yep, there are no good guys in this story, just idiots and takers.

The bigger mystery to me is why is there an important and significant change in the broadcast on British TV, when it was originally aired (I compared from copies of the VHS tapes I made of its showing on BBC at the time!) With this DVD box set?

During the showdown and the meandering walk through the gardens at Camp David, at the end of the toing and froing, Martin says: ""Damn it! Answer me!"" The President considers, then says with a sickly look: ""I'll take it."" That's in the original TV broadcast I watched in the 1970s on the BBC.

On this DVD, the President merely considers the trade, licks his lips, then walks off enigmatically without giving an answer to the proposed deal: the destruction of the Primula Report and safe retirement for Martin with his self appointed successor in place at the CIA in exchange for silence over the smoking gun.

Was that a change made for legal reasons?

Again, in the book, Perrine plays a much more telling background role in the dark side of the Nixon machine and interestingly is a closet gay. This aspect is dropped in the screenplay. Already too many ghosts or goings on in the closet? Behind closed doors?

Anybody interested in the Nixon myth will want to watch this highly entertaining and long (550 minutes!) mini-series. There are many standout performances - too numerous to list - with a major battle going on for champion sleaze ball amongst the thesps. John Houseman (This is going to cost a LOT of money!) and Robert Vaughn contend for leader of the rotten pack, while lower down the food chain the likes of the ominous Joseph Sirola (Ozymandias - your friendly arms dealer) and John Randolph (Lowmann - hotels and casinos) grovel to donate to the Nixon campaign, in cash of course. One simply has not the space here to mention the rest but it's a pack of acting aces with Nicholas Pryor giving a standout hilarious performance as the put-upon junior press relations man and his dizzy wife, promoted beyond his ability. There are moments of sheer farce in his entrances.

I don't know how Erhlichman's book ""The Company"" sold in the USA following the Watergate scandal, Nixon's resignation and his own downfall leading to prison, but we must regard 100% of it as pure fiction as with this filmed version.

The truth is that Nixon was a far greater and lesser man than depicted here. At his best one of the greatest Presidents this century. At his worst, a President who betrayed the American people. Marlon Brando used (in his autobiography ""Songs My Mother Taught Me"") Nixon's record of achievements in office set against his failures, as an example of a myth that people must keep alive in order to defy reality because they refuse to see life in any terms other than black and white. For Brando he is a wrong ""un""categorically. But as a life long Democrat, Brando, he would say that, wouldn't he?

I tend with Theodore White that while we have not seen the last re-appraisal of Nixon and his place in history, it is most certainly true that the picture of the man that has emerged from the (restricted and small) release of tapes and transcripts of White House recordings, Oliver Stone's curiously sentimentalising movie biopic, the witless sardonic portrayal by Harry Shearer in Nixons the One - echoing the campaign slogan - the unconvincing dramatisation of the Frost Nixon interview for film with Michael Sheen and Frank Langella as a guilt-ridden, hapless, old duffer, which of course Nixon never was or became, which leaves a question mark hanging over David Frost's legacy of accurate journalism, rather than Nixon's reputation...well this picture is probably far removed from the individual who re-defined American politics and the Presidency in the crisis years of Vietnam, assassinations and race riots, of strife abroad and at home.

There were other iconic events going on at the time - and the fact that this dramatization fails to give a mention to the Moon Landing of 1969 or Fischer/Spassky Chess Match in Iceland of 1972 - rather robs it of any historical context and rather hermetically seals the events portrayed into a time capsule. But the absence of any black acting talent or characters - or any mention of the racial divides of the time ( and Nixon's legislative response to it which was highly positive) is again puzzling and I think detrimental to how far we can take this portrayal of Nixon or his administration seriously.

But it is to the credit of the director and producers of this mini-series that our lasting impression of Nixon, as portrayed wonderfully by Robards, is less clear than that and probably going in the right direction whatever the exaggerations. By ending the film at precisely the moment Nixon reaches the summit of his long arduous career while showing all the seeds and conditions, including his own character defects and vices, drifting into place that would shortly emerge and erupt to bring about his fall, the creators of this magnificent film have appropriately left the bean counting and final verdict to others.",1422748800,2,7197,4.769477911646586
5089562,5,B007ISJS8M,"I saw this in the 70s on British TV and loved it, so now great to get a DVD finally released after such a long time. The whole thing was so fresh then - based clearly on Watergate and the recent Nixon administration scandals, it was both very current and used story telling in a way that took another thirty odd years to become mainstream per the endless TV serializations we now have post Sopranos and West Wing. This series based on actual events took a clear decision to terminate on the discovery of Watergate and so there were no follow on series of what happened to Nixon after the scandal broke.

That freshness still shows though though the rather 70s style of film shooting (too many zooms and a recapping at the start of each episode of the prior episodes) shows how TV has moved on. The script is fast moving and the many intertwining story threads as well as guessing the real persons the characters were portraying was pretty well unseen at that time in any TV series. The stellar cast is faultless though my favourite is still Robert Vaughan then remembered for his ""Man from Uncle"" TV role, showing a hard and ruthless edge as the Bob Haldeman character, Nixon's ""Prince of Darkness"".

A great historical and groundbreaking TV series for me at least.",1416528000,2,1265,4.568281938325991

5089565,4,B007ISJS8M,"Revisiting TV programs from the 1970s invites comparison to what is being produced on television today. Shows like The West Wing have set a new standard for dramatizing politics. Yet a superior mini-series like WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS holds up very well for any number of reasons: the timeless story that reminds us that absolute power corrupts absolutely; the incredible assembly of first-rate actors including Jason Robards and Robert Vaughn (who won an Emmy for his efforts); and the direction, which includes any number of impressive shots at a time when television production was still considered a static, rather than a visual, medium. What doesnt hold up as well is the technical standard of production, which serves as a reminder of the wonders of the digital age. Some of the footage in WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS is inevitably quite grainy.

Fortunately, content trumps technical specifics every time, and the political machinations of WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSED DOORS make for some fascinating viewing.

My first reaction as the story unfolded was here comes another Hollywood Liberal Democratic indictment of Republicanism, but as the storyline unfolded, it became clear the scope was not so narrow-minded. Although some of the effects, such as freeze frames, are dated, some unabashedly over-the-top performances propel the series into the realm of Greek Tragedy. There is genuine amazement, horror, remorse and hope for justice in the proceedings and this keeps the series from falling into the category of mere Democratic diatribe. Lets face it, Nixon is an easy target. With source material written by one of the ex-presidents closest associates, even the most outlandish behaviour (the presidents paranoia, for example) is believable even while being eminently theatrical. Fortunately, the cumulative effect is more look at what happened to our country and how much of it is still true without painting so obvious a picture as a Them VS Us scenario, which, lets be honest, would only satisfy about half the audience. The abuse of power on display is not about one particular party, it is rather a warning to us all that even in a free society, governments can and frequently do fail, especially when those at the top of the food chain are permitted to wallow in greed, paranoia and fear.

The allusion to Greek Tragedy is appropriate, for taking this road of exploiting the obvious theatricality of the series elevates the story to a more neutral plain. Because of the delicate balancing act between theatrics and realism achieved by the director, this expert blending of stylistic choices does not prevent fine actors like Cliff Robertson from being wholly natural and believable. There is some beautifully nuanced work by him, Lois Nettleton and Harold Gould, especially, to name a few. Contrast this with Robards theatricality, Vaughns Machiavellian manipulations and Nicholas Pryors whining simp of an Ill do anything to get ahead character, and youve got a wide range of dramatic dynamics to keep things interesting.

Less successful in the overtly theatrical front is Andy Griffith as a president modeled after the charismatic Lyndon B. Johnson. His performance in the role does not ring true. Griffith is an outstanding and beloved actor, but this time he misses the mark. Conversely, Stefanie Powers character is underwritten. Her performance simply doesnt register on this grand scale, preventing her from having any significant impact on the audience. Powers plays the mistress of Cliff Robertson. Eventually, when he returns to his wife it becomes clear that this sub-plot is a metaphor for a country steered off course for awhile but finding its way back, or, more simply, a return to values and morality. Ultimately it is a purely functional part and could have been played just as effectively by a no-name actress. Powers is as talented and beautiful as ever, but she is wasted in this role.

American politics, it seems from this Canadians perspective, has always been about extremes. Perhaps this is inevitable with a two-party system. Polarization between the Republicans and Democrats was arguably never so extreme as during the double whammy crises of the Vietnam War and Watergate. This is fertile ground for drama and WASHINGTON: BEHIND CLOSES DOORS does not disappoint. Perhaps the timing of this DVD release by Acorn Media is appropriate to an election year. Question is, will current political scandal and intrigue turn out to be as interesting as that depicted in this long but rewarding mini-series? One would hope not.",1397433600,5,4574,5.209239130434782

What's different is the fact that Congress was far more of a real check and balance back then (one Party didn't control all the levers of power), and grand visions like the overture to China could co-exist alongside despicable domestic conniving. But the isolating of a President, the coddling and stoking of his ego, the managing or pandering to his tantrums, far transcend the Watergate evocation of the 70's. The cast is spellbinding, mesmerizing in conveying the vagaries of human lusts, passions and fears. There are imperfect heroes and some perfect villains, and if the tempo and camera work can be a little tough on us today used as we are to fast paced, frenetic dramas...there is something about slowing down to listen, look, feel and think, that makes this a remarkable piece of dramatic entertainment: a fascinating window to our political past, but as well in many ways, a troubling mirror to our political present.
