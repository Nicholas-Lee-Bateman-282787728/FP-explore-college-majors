8647819,5,B00J3Z4KZ4,"Brilliant bundle price, for the two 3D movies; although I got them for when the grandkids visit, I watched them myself first.  To be honest, I hadn't expected a lot from Turbo, but it punched above it's weight, in my estimation.  I didn't watch Croods all the way through, just enough to check out that there were no initial glitches.  So the delights of that film still await me.",1399852800,,380,4.478260869565218
