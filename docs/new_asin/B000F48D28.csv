2551098,2,B000F48D28,"My 6-year-old son, who had minimal knowledge of soccer at the time, found this DVD to be extremely basic, slow-paced, and (in his word) ""babyish.""
I forced myself to sit through it with him, and tried to seem interested and enthusiastic, but it didn't work.  If your kids are still on level with Dora the Explorer, this might fly...  Otherwise, give it a pass (so to speak).",1248048000,,374,4.567164179104478
2551099,5,B000F48D28,"I was shocked at how engaged my child actually WAS by this DVD. He loves soccer and he wants to learn how to play so he can play on a real team next year, and he went crazy as soon as he opened this present for his birthday! We watched it right away and after each section we had to stop and try out the new skill.",1238803200,,314,3.701492537313433
2551100,5,B000F48D28,"I bought this for my nephew, who is a aspiring soccer star.  However, the program he belongs to is severly underfunded and most of the instructors have no idea about teaching the basics of soccer and his team has become the ""Bad News Bears"" of the city's youth soccer league.  Now my newphew, who is nine years old, loves the video and regularly puts what he learns into practice.  Maybe now his team can win a game.",1238716800,,416,4.376623376623376
2551101,5,B000F48D28,This is a good basic information dvd on the sport.  The dvd format keeps a childs interest in a fun way so they remember the explanations etc.,1212364800,6,142,4.2592592592592595
2551102,5,B000F48D28,"My five year old son has been really struggling at soccer, even though he is a fast runner and very co-ordinated he was just wandering around the field looking lost. So I spent three months looking for a good kids Soccer DVD to teach him. This was the third we had tried and it is brilliant!! He watched it six tims in the first two days. He had his first post-DVD soccer game yesterday and the difference was astounding. He excitedly jumped out of the car for the first time, dribbled the ball perfectly from the car to his time for the first time, line up with his team and kicked his first goal and started jumping up and down with excitment. He was very pleased with himself and the first thing he asked for this morning was, ""Mum, can I please watch the soccer movie again?"".",1178323200,15,780,4.312925170068027
2551103,4,B000F48D28,"Actually, checked this out from the library several years ago.  My daughter who has turned into a reasonably good soccer player (not necessarily thanks to this video, but...) really liked this video at the age of 7-8 years and actually remembers it.  It is a basic resource that will hold their attention and can be the basis for a conversation on what they should be doing on the field.  It is not comprehensive, but a good start for young kids in playing fundementals.",1168041600,6,470,4.63855421686747
2551104,3,B000F48D28,"Your 4 or 5 year old would probably love this movie.  I have 5 kids with their ages ranging from 4-10.  My 4 year old liked it, but the others noticed how the lips of the person talking didn't line up with the words being said.  Also, the video itself was not the best quality.  It did cover basic soccer skills that a very young child might enjoy seeing.",1162339200,2,355,4.101449275362318
8117243,4,B000F48D28,"I have a daughter on the autism spectrum (age 4), and I ordered this to help her get the fundamentals.  She and her twin brother play soccer, and she is often lost on the field.  I saw a lot of people say it was for ""babies"" and only taught the basics, and one compared it to Dora the Explorer.  Well, it is not as interesting as Dora, but it does do a good job introducing fundamentals.  I did expect more from it--but it was not all bad.",1492387200,,439,4.011494252873563

8117245,5,B000F48D28,"On a technical level, I might score this video lower, but there is no way around the fact that the kids love watching this video. As a result, you have to say it is successful in getting them to watch and learn some very basics of soccer.",1401580800,,238,4.085106382978723
8117246,2,B000F48D28,"This wasn't very good at all
I bought it for someone else and glad I reviewed it first before giving it to them
pass",1386288000,,116,3.875
8117247,5,B000F48D28,"Purchased this video for my 5 yr old grandson, who wasn't enjoying soccer and was one of the younger ones on his team. At the beginning of the video it talked about a little boy who didn't think he was as good a player as the rest of the team.  When my grandson heard that, he looked at his Mommy and said,""that is like me"".  That moment was priceless and it was as though his spirit was unleashed.  His participation and confidence went through the roof.  It is a great training video as well as meets emotional needs in young childern and adults.

I might add that my grandson is separated from his father and I think videos like this sometimes reaches out to childern with one parent.  There is just no way one parent can do what two  good parents can do.

A+++++++

I salute the creator.

Concerning the shipper, he went above my expectations.

Thank you Amazon.",1319414400,,866,4.383647798742138
8117248,2,B000F48D28,"this is so basic as to almost not be valuable.  It's pretty much a waste of money.  I recommend getting a more advanced video, even for very beginners.",1295740800,,151,4.357142857142857
8117249,4,B000F48D28,This DVD is a good beginners overview of soccer. The talking ball is a little goofy but my boys like it.,1283299200,,104,4.0
8117250,5,B000F48D28,I bought this DVD for my son to watch before playing his first soccer game ever.  He still has a lot of skills to work on of course but I feel like this helped him get a feel for how the game is played.  He will finish his first season next week and he has shown real improvement.  There is no substitute for attending practices and playing real games but I feel like this gave him the confidence to get in there and participate.,1274918400,,429,4.083333333333333
8117251,3,B000F48D28,The intro is way too long although the video itself is too short.  The time would've been better spent getting down to brass tacks about soccer techniques.,1268006400,,155,4.7407407407407405
8117252,5,B000F48D28,I am using this video to teach my physical education class the basic skills of soccer. The students love it!,1265846400,,108,4.45
