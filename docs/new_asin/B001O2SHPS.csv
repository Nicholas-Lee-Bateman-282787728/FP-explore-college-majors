3726353,5,B001O2SHPS,This film describes the tragedy of divorce and substance abuse in the most personal and universal way.  Even though my family did not divorce I felt very emotional while watching the film.  Touching and not sentimental.  Loved it.,1231286400,,230,5.0

8329128,5,B001O2SHPS,"In The Watershed, filmmaker, Mary Trunk, shares the harrowing story of her own family's plummet from their typical, middle-class American dream to the nightmarish depths of divorce, desertion and homelessness. Trunk takes us back to her childhood in the 70s when her father uproots the family from Long Island to sunny California for a job that doesn't pan out. Dad leaves, Mom fades into an alcoholic haze, leaving the seven siblings to beg, borrow and steal  in order to survive.

Three decades later, Trunk doesn't shy away from asking her siblings, parents and relatives very tough questions to make sense of what happened. Their surprisingly candid answers reveal stark truths behind grainy home movies of the once seemingly ""perfect family"". But The Watershed  is not a simple story of one family's dysfunction and redemption. Viewers will find themselves examining their own lives through the lens of Trunk's account, which is both poignant and unsentimental. Trunk's remarkable objectivity in piecing together these events of her life reminds us of our own childhoods when even trusted and well-intentioned adults failed us, of us the tenuous ties that hold our families and lives together, of the complexity of acceptance and forgiveness. What emerges from the wreckage is the story of a family that has decided to face and move on from the past, scars and all. More importantly, The Watershed subtly urges us to look inward and remember that there but for the grace of God go anyone one of us.",1321401600,,1503,5.05241935483871
8329129,5,B001O2SHPS,"This moving film stayed with me for days after I watched it, and I felt compelled to leave a review, which I rarely do. I chose the title of this review because the film accomplished what so many documentaries fail to deliver...that is, a story revealed in a modest and thorough treatment that doesn't opine or judge. Nothing sensational, nothing exaggerated. This is, quite simply, the story of a fascinating and dysfunctional family told by the family members themselves. The filmmaker is the eldest daughter, Mary Trunk.

This is the story of a family torn apart by infidelity, alcoholism and divorce in the 1970's. I appreciated that this film included really funny home movies, testimonies from both parents, and each of the six siblings commenting on how this saga shaped them. Their spirit, humor and candor enrich this film and made me think about how our struggles affect us as adults.

Those of us who saw ""Cinema Verite"" and followed the story of the Loud family in Santa Barbara, may have expected some similarities in this film. Not so. ""The Watershed"" manages to relate this dysfunctional tale with an elegant sensitivity. Mary Trunk and Paul Sanchez have deftly crafted a film that really reminds the viewer why we appreciate documentary films.",1316390400,,1259,4.962085308056872
8329130,5,B001O2SHPS,"Riveting.  A true American story of family, betrayal, loss of faith and redemption.  It had me laughing and crying and totally engrossed. The filmmaker lets her characters speak for themselves and collectively they give a very nuanced account of what coming apart at the seams feels like.",1315958400,,288,5.1063829787234045
8329131,5,B001O2SHPS,"This story of a dysfunctional family has heroes and -- if not villains, certainly adults who could have acted more directly to help the children in this troubled household.  In addition to an aunt and uncle who were willing to step forward, the real heroes are the children themselves.  There is real joy is seeing them as adults who are willing to share their painful history.  As angry as I felt towards the parents, I also got a sense of the struggles they faced, particularly the mother, and felt the documentary gave them a fair chance to express their side of the story.  Congratulations to the director in being able to film this story of her own family with understanding and compassion.",1315872000,,695,4.672131147540983
8329132,4,B001O2SHPS,"This film has to resonate with many of us raised in the 50s and 60s.  I believe that as some of us grew up, developed relationships, and had families of our own, we recognized that our parents were merely human, even if they positioned themselves--and treated us--as though they were beyond human without failings or weaknesses.

And as we struggle with the question of whether to forgive our parents for the damage that may have been done to us, or to rail against it, speak about it, even expect or demand some inkling of understanding or contrition from our parents, the Watershed puts the discussion in a very honest and real context.  It doesn't indict, but rather lets the truth unfold in the participant's words and experiences, allowing us to draw our own conclusions. I suppose that if my father, (who emotionally deserted his family rather than physically--and the film makes you question which is worse) were to watch the Watershed, he would likely not identify with the father, or would find similar rationalizations for his inexcusable behavior.  It's unfortunate, but it's honest.

For me, although the specifics of the Trunk family were different than the details of my life, when the film ended I had a warm and peaceful feeling.  I felt like I'd had a long talk with one of my siblings, with the emotional detachment of time and distance, and realized that it wasn't just me that felt that way.",1287705600,,1411,4.7860082304526745
8329133,5,B001O2SHPS,"The Watershed (Mary Trunk, 2003). Trunk makes this film to peel away layers of confusion about a mysterious but disastrous event in her own family life. A man deserts his family almost without explanation, sending his unprepared spouse into a tail-spin. An alcoholic, she inaugurates a Long Weekend that lasts years, and is utterly unable to handle the basic needs of the children. Because the events are in the Kodachrome early '70s (there is an extensive amount of poignant home movie footage) the ensuing journey from Cheever country to homelessness is even more striking.

I don't quite understand how, but as The Watershed unfolds, it avoids being an exercise in maudlin self-therapy. There is the inevitable confrontation between father and filmmaker daughter, which is not as cathartic as either hopes. The father remains an enigma, a baffled, involuted narcissist, who cannot begin to fathom anything outside his closely guarded pleasure zone. Mary Trunk keeps herself scrupulously outside the frame of the film, relying on her siblings, cousins, aunt and uncle to unravel the story of her lost parents. The distance makes the film more effective than say, My Architect: A Son's Journey (Nathaniel Kahn, 2003) which treads similar ground but ultimately rings sentimental and false. What's amazing about this film is that there isn't a trace of self-pity in it. By stepping out of her own frame of reference, Trunk gives the film what it requires - the rigour and purpose of art. The film finally, and movingly, accomplishes what its protagonists so desperately longed for - it stitches this broken family back together.",1239926400,3,1627,5.162878787878788
8329134,5,B001O2SHPS,"This film takes you to the heart of a family crisis in 1973.  Jack Trunk moves his wife and seven kids from the east coast traditions of Long Island to the celebrated freedoms of west coast Santa Barbara. In short order he loses his job and disappears from his family. Overwhelmed by her husband's desertion, Paula retreats into an impenetrable alcoholic fugue.  Now abandoned by both parents and a continent away from their tight-knit Catholic clan, the kids must fend for themselves. And they do, bonding together tighter than ever to save each other and themselves.

Wrecked families are not unusual. Overwrought examinations of past wrongs can be a bad filmmaker's indulgence.  But The Watershed is special and unique in that the entire family weighs in, one by one, with their own take on what happened. A son recalls stealing his mom's wedding ring to buy lunch. Jack attempts to dispel his shame and looks into the camera, daring the viewer to accept his revisionist history. Each of them paints a different picture of the same landscape.

Director and daughter Mary Trunk is careful to exclude her opinions and keeps her inquiry agenda-free. This clear-eyed approach allows the subjects to speak to the viewer so candidly, so unguardedly that you have the sense of spying on a private conversation. The secrets, hopes and fears of a collective lifetime are laid bare for your consideration.

Beautifully edited with a wealth of the family's 8mm home movies, you witness the times as they are described - skinny ties, rambunctious kids, parties and all. I judge movies by whether they can get me to really care about the characters.  In this case, The Watershed had me crying tears of happiness for the family that got lost in trouble and found their way out. The story is so engrossing you won't stop it until the credits roll.",1231891200,,1835,4.843450479233227
