8608000,5,B00EPFEZ0M,"Wow, what a great triple-feature for fans of action/horror/grindhouse/biker cinema. You can't go wrong. Must have for your DVD collection all on one handy package. Not for the kids to say the least... oodles of violence, gore and nudity, sometimes gratuitous, which is standard and expected for this style of cinema and why its fans like it... so have at it. Very high quality acting, plotting, dialogue and cinematography by some of the best in the business. Love it.",1486598400,,468,4.936708860759493
