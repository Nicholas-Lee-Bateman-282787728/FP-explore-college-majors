8253989,4,B00141FXHY,"Wasnt expecting much from this film, but it was a good blend of the horror films of the 30s and the humor of Abbott and Costello. And it works well as both a horror film and a comedy. Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi recreate their roles as the Wolfman and Dracula. Frankenstein actually plays a supporting role. Whether you're a fan of Abbott and Costello or not, this is an entertaining film.",1472515200,,392,4.383561643835616

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello were probably the greatest comedians in twentieth century America. They made many comedies that dealt with life, such as Buck Privates, In the Navy, In Hollywood, Keep Em Flying, In the Foreign Legion, etc. I never saw a bad movie. They also had a radio show and a television show. These are satires on the horror movies of the 1930s. You should have seen the original horror movies to best appreciate these satires, but its not necessary. All their movies were funny and very popular. Some of their movies dealt with the popular Westerns of that time (Ride Em Cowboy and The Wistful Widow of Wagon Gap). Read the individual reviews for more details.

Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein.
The boys work in shipping, they move crates from Europe to the House of Horror. These are the remains of Frankenstein and Dracula. Larry Talbot calls to warn them! There is comic action and confusion along with the threats from monsters.

Abbot and Costello Meet the Mummy.
An archeologist found a mummy in Egypt and ships it to America. But some try to prevent this! There is a song and dance. A missing map will reveal the location of a vast treasure. There are repeats of earlier comic skits. Will it end in a blast?",1436832000,,1272,4.644444444444445
8253991,5,B00141FXHY,"As fans of Bud & Lou or UNIVERSAL horror pictures will tell you, BUD ABBOTT AND LOU COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN (1948) (originally called ""The Brain of Frankenstein"") is unique in that company's catalogue, for herein are assembled three of their legendary monsters (Frankie, Drac and Wolfie), playing against the studio's most popular comedy team.

""The Frankenstein Monster,"" as he's correctly referred to (thus the boys never actually ""meet"" Frankenstein, the scientist), is Glenn Strange. Boris Karloff was asked to reprise the role but declined, fearing this picture would tank with moviegoers. After its phenomenal success however, just one year later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ABBOTT-AND-COSTELLO-MEET-THE-KILLER-BORIS-KARLOFF/dp/B0002FIJTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET THE KILLER, BORIS KARLOFF</a>&nbsp;would bring them together at last.

""Bud and Lou Meet Frankie"" marks the second and final time that Bela Lugosi portrayed his most renowned character on screen, and also the last Classic Era appearances of the other two monsters. Vampire bat and Dracula transformation cartoons seen here were penned by UNIVERSAL's resident animator, Walter Lantz.

Lon Chaney Jr. (Wolfman) played the monster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-GHOST-OF-FRANKENSTEIN/dp/6302841771/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN</a>&nbsp;(1942) and he was the Transylvanian Count in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SON-OF-DRACULA/dp/6301005783/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SON OF DRACULA</a>&nbsp;(1943). For one sequence here (while Glenn Strange had an injured ankle), Chaney again dons Frankie's fixin's. Mr. Strange BTW, was primarily a bit player in 'B' westerns.

THE STORY:
Freight handlers Chick (Bud) and Wilbur (Lou) receive large crates containing Drac's and Frankie's remains, but Frankie isn't really dead and Drac is undead but sleeping. Larry Talbot (Wolfie) arrives from Jolly Old, hoping to prevent Drac from reanimating a monster sorely in need of a new brain. Drac tries to steal Wilbur's gray matter with the help of the poor guy's reticent sweety, Dr. Sandra Mornay (Lenore Aubert).",1269561600,2,2261,6.840277777777778
