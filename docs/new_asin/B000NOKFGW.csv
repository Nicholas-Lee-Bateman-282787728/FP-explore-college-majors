2775861,5,B000NOKFGW,"This show Kyle XY has brought so much to ABC Family for it's full 10 episode run of the summer had many viewers asking question's ""Who is KYLE XY?"" A boy new to the world fully grown, walking the forest naked, with memory loss and no belly button. Kyle XY (Matt Dallas) plays a good feature role in this new season every episode ending with a cliff hanger capturing the audiences eye, and kept on asking questions about Kyle XY.

The Pilot episode contained alot of information and then again asked alot of question. A smart young man now seeing the world through the eyes of a new born child, not intimidated by others who oppose a threat to him like the snake in the woods and the bully trying to start some stuff with Kyle. Nicole Trager (Marguerite MacIntyre)a mom a councilor who takes Kyle in and meets the family Stephen Trager (Bruce Thomas) Josh Trager (Jean-Luc Bilodeau) and Lori Trager(April Matson) who takes Kyle into their home. My favorite part of this episode is when Kyle follows Lori to a party and saves Lori from a cop who is about to arrest her and shows some of the skills Kyle posseses. I don't want to ruin the show for you but would rather give you a teaser to let the audience know what this show is all about.

The second episode is Sleepless in Seatle. Kyle is having trouble sleeping but begs to ask the question ""Why do people sleep when there is so much knowledge to learn"". Yet Kyle wanders the street and there is a man who is nameless but knows Kyle's past.......My favorite part is when he pieces together a puzzle in less then 5 minutes (you gotta watch it).

The Third episode is The lies that bind. Kyle is confused about telling the truth and telling a lie. Knowing that the truth can hurt yet he is torn between betrayal of the spouces and the parents. My favorite part of the episode is when Stephen Trager takes Kyle to his job while the computers are down as the temp tries to contact a tech. Kyle comes to the rescue.

The Fourth episode is Diving In. Kyle has a crush on Amanda Bloom (Kirsten Prout) and Amanda teaches Kyle how to swim but something happens in this episode that was I believe rated. This episode is about Kyle's first love and first heartbreak. My favorite part in this episode was when Amanda taught Kyle how to swim and Kyle no less than 20 minutes took off like a dolphin.

This Fifth episode is This is not a Test. Kyle goes to school for the first time. Spend weeks with the Tragers Kyle is in a new world and is accused of not coorperating with the system of taking an exam. He learns by reading the entire encyclopedia with the help of his loner friend Deichman (Cascy Beddow). My favorite part of this episode is when Josh Trager got into a fight with a bully and Kyle caught one of his punches after being thrown down a flight of stairs.........and after school after acing the test Kyle wanted to thank Deichman for his help and managed to make a friend in the class nerd.

the Sixth episode is Blame it on the Rain. Kyle gets smarter in ever episode. It is Lori's birthday and it manages to rain and Lori's Boyfriend Declan (Chris Olivero) crashes the party after Amanda introduced her boyfriend to Kyle he has been hurt but still managed to make a friend in her. Kyle learns more about images so clear in his mind that he draws the perfect image to life and then that is where the memories start comming back to the surface.

The Seventh episode is Kyle got Game. Kyle joins the high school basketball tean which Stephen Trager supports Kyle 100 percent which drives a wedge between his own son. Then Kyle gets real close to his new found friend Declan.

The Eigh Episode is Memory Serves. Kyle decides to travel to a college where he sees himself 20 years ago and tries to find answers only then is confronted by the mysterious man Thomas Foss (Nicholas Lea) who fights Kyle not to continue further or something bad will happen..........

The Ninth Episode is Overheard. Kyle has the ability to read lips and over hear through walls but this ability comes with a heavy consequence. Kyle and Declan work together to piece together memories that were lost and then later Kyle is confronted by his real parents.

The Tenth Episode is Endgame. Stephen, Lori, Josh and Nicole Trager are heartbroken over the fact that Kyle is going home to his real parents alot of questions are answered in the episode and many questions remain. My favorite part is when Nicole Trager is forced to let out her emotions after being strong for her family after the departer of Kyle.....is he going home to his real parents or is danger still lurking around the corner.

The second season of Kyle XY season premires on June 11, 2007 but for those who do not know ""WHO KYLE XY IS?"" here is your chance to find out and I promise you the price here on amazon is real cheap unlike the ones in the retail stores. Kyle XY is a real clever show brought to you by ABC Family and this show will bring you into the world of KYLE XY.",1176076800,29,4974,4.401523394994559

2775863,5,B000NOKFGW,"I love Kyle XY -- I bought and downloaded all the season 1 episodes from the iTunes Store to my Mac Mini's iTunes Library (that's right I now use Mac computers after switching a few years back from Windows world and have an Intel compatible Mac Mini) and transfered over to my 80 GB video iPod. I am planning to buy an Apple TV in the near future and my first HDTV shortly afterward -- I bought it on iTunes because of convenience the store provides, I don't have to go to a video store to buy it on location and don't have to pay shipping and handling charges for ordering home delivery -- also up till now Kyle XY has only been available on iTunes -- no DVD (other shows I bought on iTunes because of cheaper pricing than DVDs or because DVDs released for such shows were theme DVDs with only few episodes -- imagine if Buena Vista Home Entertainment had released a theme DVD with only the first 5 episodes of Kyle XY but the entire first season all 10 episodes were on iTunes -- that's not fair to fans who want the DVD -- also if you buy the DVD you have more rights to the content -- can back up a copy of the videos to your hard drive, convert it for your video iPod etc or play it on your television via your DVD Player, whereas videos bought on the iTunes Store are copy protected with DRM restrictions that cannot be easily removed. Also if you buy the DVD you get bonus features not included in a video on demand (VOD based iTunes purchase) so downloaded video has less advantages than disadvantages but to some until they try video on demand downloads unless they have read the pros and cons in advance they won't know about these issues. Misinformation is the enemy of anti-DRM activists -- the more consumers are informed the less they will support such systems and support content that is not copy protected.

Buying video on iTunes has some advantages but after a thorough analysis and comprehensive review of the situation I find buying the DVD to be a better choice. Fortunately Buena Vista Home Entertainment is making a season 1 release of Kyle XY with the entire season on DVD.",1173312000,8,2097,4.376923076923077
2775864,5,B000NOKFGW,"This word describes both the main character of the show as well as the show itself.  Kyle XY follows the current television trend of creating shows with mystery in them following in the footsteps of such shows as Lost and Heroes.  However Kyle XY reaches an emotional depth and wonder that is not even begun to be touched upon by the other show.  Kyle himself is a boy genius within the body of a young man.  He has complete amnsesia when you first meet him not even knowing how to talk but as the show progressess both his verbal skills and social skill grow.  Slowly the mystery begins to unravel about where Kyle came from and what is the nature of his creation. The actor who plays Kyle is genius making you see the world through is eyes.  Indeed, next to Battle Star Galactica this is the best show on television.",1173139200,13,818,4.3841059602649
2775865,5,B000NOKFGW,"`Kyle XY' exploded onto the television landscape last summer after months of a singular promotional campaign showing a naked teen-age boy wondering around in the forest with the tagline `who is kyle xy.'  But the promotional Campaign did its job correctly, because not only did `Kyle XY' because the most watched program to air on ABC Family, but was a rating powerhouse for ABC as well.

From the very first moment when we meet Kyle, laying naked, scared, and alone in the middle of a Washington forest, till when he finds a family within the Tragger family and starts on his quest to find out where he came from - millions of people all around the World where hooked.

Throughout the first season, the audience follows Kyle as he acclimates himself to a life without a memory in a foster-family in a new surroundings, to his discovery of just `how weird he is,' and initially to his quest to try and find his true parents and were he really came from, and why he is how he is.  But more than that Kyle is learning what it is like to be a teenager in the new millinum, going through all the same growing pains as his serogate siblings including crushes, puberty, school, and learning how to interact in a social world.

""Kyle XY: The Complete First Season' comes with all 10 episodes on three discs with audio commentaries, deleted scenes, an alternate pilot, extended version of the season finale, and `secrets revealed' featurette, and is set to be released only a month prior to the second season premier.",1172275200,60,1509,4.615671641791045

Matt Dallas does a great job of portraying Kyle and the supporting cast is great as well.  This was one of those series that just grabbed me from the beginning.  Sure, there are parts that I did not like as much as others, but it all comes together in one fashion or another.  The plot has already been discussed so I will not go into that.  This is a show you can watch with the family.",1437350400,,539,4.037735849056604

2775997,5,B000NOKFGW,This was a great premise that differed from other sci-fi series. I liked the way the everyday humans acted like ordinary people and Kyle's story was more about him learning about his past and limits to his power.

2776031,4,B000NOKFGW,"If you like Smallville, you might like this.  It's early Smallville with less action and more teenage drama stuff.
I wish I liked this series more than I do. I just finished watching season 2 and I probably won't be watching season 3 any time soon.  It has its good points: likeable characters/actors (for the most part) and some clever ideas. The whole ""fish out of water has to learn how to live in the world"" aspect hooks you into the series, though this is aspect gets de-emphasized in Kyle and transferred to a new character in the next season.  It's always fun having Nicholas Lea (X-files' Krychek) in a series.  How the show could have been better:
1. Get rid of Hillary- the cookie-cutter evil popular girl.  Since she's Lori's best friend, Lori suffers via guilt by association.  ""Look, Lori, you can't be best friends with Cordelia Chase.""
2. Have slightly better actors for the Trager parents - and write them more realistically (no parents are THIS permissive, without the kids turning into monsters.)  Their acting does get better in the second season, or perhaps I just got used to them.
3. Make the plot a little more believable.  ""Hey, there's this kid who is a complete amnesiac.  Let's throw him into high school!"" (Okay, I get why they did this, but they could have handled the transition more smoothly.)
4. Get rid of the Smallville-esque whiny moany music (one of the things I hated the most about Smallville. Is that what the young-uns are really into these days?)

4 stars is me being nice.

mediately bought the remaining two seasons. I enjoyed every single episode.
I must add that I live in EUROPE, and never saw any of this show's episodes till last month. A few weeks later, I'd
seen them all, and wonder why ALL OF MY FAVORITE SCI-FI SERIES GET CANCELLED before their 5th season...

2776061,5,B000NOKFGW,"I'm so happy I randomly decided to see what cheap DVDs were for sale. This is one of my absolute favorite TV series and the first season is amazing. The pilot for Kyle XY is hands-down my favorite pilot ever. When I got the DVD, I watched it twice in a row. Kyle XY is funny, intriguing, and makes you wish you were a member of the Trager family. It also makes you wish you were incredibly smart. I think it's a really interesting concept and it makes you think about your own morality in relation to the characters. This is a fantastic show that highlights what it means to be a family and all of the relationships seem very genuine.

I was really pleased with the special features, especially the alternate pilot (what a shock). Ultimately, I'm happy with the final pilot, but it was really cool to see more of the proposed story. I also really enjoyed listening to the commentary, everyone who worked on the show was so into it and it's easy to see they got along great. It was nice to learn more about the process of making the show.

I definitely recommend this show to any and everyone interested in sci-fi and family dynamics! It's more than worth the investment, especially at the price it's being offered at currently. Next step: finding the second season at another great price.",1399420800,2,1288,4.476595744680851

2776116,4,B000NOKFGW,"Kyle XY was the first successful original show on ABC family. Featuring cute boys, which played right into their key demographic of teenage girls. Kyle woke up having no memory, like some big adorable baby. Not wanting the show to be some cutesy messed up version of the Brady Bunch, the producers actually gave the show a complicated storyline, which made it much better, but also led to it's downfall. The series starts when Kyle wakes up naked in the woods outside of Seattle. He has no memory and doesn't know how to do anything. He's quickly put into a group home, as a John Doe, where he gains the attention and admiration of the local psychologist, Nicole Trager (Marguerite MacIntyre). Trager knows that Kyle will never survive in that environment and decides to foster him. Once at the Trager house, Kyle doesn't need to just learn the basics of survival, but also the social norms associated with being part of a family. The series starts out with Kyle as a clean slate, having to learn everything from eating to using the bathroom, and to me this was the worst part of the show. It did however give the stations key demographic exactly what it demanded and lead to these episodes being the networks highest rated to date. Wanting to show off Kyle's abilities and not wanting him to be some loveable moron, the writers shifted the focus to Kyle's extraordinary abilities and how he uses them to try and find out who he is and where he came from. That's the point where the show started to get interesting to me and of course the point where the ratings started to decline. Show some trendy teenage girls, a bunch of cute boys being adorable and you've got high ratings, but show those same boys as part of a global conspiracy, that makes you think, and those girls want nothing to do with it. Half way through the first season, Kyle XY went from a lame family show to a terrific science fiction drama. Matt Dallas stars as Kyle and he has a lot going for him. Dallas is good looking, athletic, and intelligent, unfortunately he's not a very good actor and many times seemed like some emotionless robot, who was reading lines from a cue card. Thankfully the family and friends surrounding him were far better actors than he was. The Trager family is a terrific mix of wit and emotion that is centered on Kyle, but doesn't focus solely on him. There is a terrific storyline featuring the daughter Lori's (April Matson) entrance into sexual activity with her boyfriend Declin (Chris Olivero), who may be the single most talented person on this cast. The brother Josh (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), gives much needed comic relief to the show, while teaching Kyle the things every teenaged boy needs to know. Kyle XY was a magically complex show that blended a great science fiction story with comedy and family drama, unfortunately it was on the wrong network. A show like this could have continued to grow and come out of nowhere to be a mix of the X-Files and 90210, that appealed to a huge audience, instead, it was geared toward teenage girls who just didn't want to think. The show was designed for a large audience on a network that has a very limited demographic. Ultimately the cute boys and the occasional comedy just wasn't enough to keep them interested and the show was canceled after 3 seasons. In my opinion this show was just starting to hit it's stride and should it have been on a network that appealed to a larger audience, it would probably still be on the air today.",1370563200,2,3482,4.59967845659164

It shows how our consciousness effects the world around us.  Just as Kyle inspires and changes the lives of the people in his life, the series Kyle XY can transform the lives of the people who watch it.  Even though it is labeled as science fiction/fantasy, you don't have to be a science fiction fan to enjoy it because it is so much more.  There is mystery in it because the series starts out with the question of who is Kyle?  As questions are answered, more questions unfold so there is always an air of mystery.  There are twists and turns and surprises so you never know what will happen next.  If you are a person who likes to think, be enlightened, enjoys being inspired to be a better person, or just want to be entertained, you will find Kyle XY well worth your time and will want to see it over again (and may even join the effort to revive it as fans around the world are doing).",1369526400,,1050,4.2944162436548226

2776170,4,B000NOKFGW,"I've been watching so many other ABC Family shows so I figured I'd give it a shot. Plus, the entire series is up on hulu, which is a huge plus.

Kyle XY tells the story of a teenage boy who wakes up in the middle of the woods with no clothes and no memories. He's taken in by a psychologist, her husband, and two kids (Josh and Lori) who slowly teach him how to fit in with regular society (he lacks all semblance of social skills, originally even lacking speech, though he learns this quickly). The series follows Kyle as he adjusts to life as a regular teenager and tries to discover the secrets of his past.

In the beginning, I was somewhat disappointed:

  As a general rule, I dislike voiceovers. For them to be worthwhile, they have to be both informative and used sparingly. otherwise they become irritating. A good example of well used VOs is Grey's Anatomy: they lead you in with cues of what the characters are struggling with and ends with what they've taken from the cases they've dealt with. A poor example of VOs would be Sex in the City where they continue throughout the show, are rarely informative, and are mostly redundant with exactly what you will see in a second. In Kye XY, the voiceover is mostly redundant. We can see that Kyle doesn't know how to answer the history questions, we don't need him to tell us that.
  The entire gimmick of the show is that Kyle is not normal (he has no navel, he woke up in the middle of nowhere with no clothes, he remembers nothing but feels most comfortable sleeping in a bathtub, he's freakishly smart). And while we do see a lot of Kyle being unfamiliar with the world around him, in five episodes we have yet to see or hear any possible hints towards his origins. Instead, the drama around him is learning to become part of high school (which because of his voiceover is less funny or more solemn) and worrying about a murder that he may or may not have witnessed.
  As far as a show about normal teenagers trying to navigate through high school goes, the show does a decent job. It's certainly nothing special. Just the standard teen issues of finding friends, dealing with ""the chill,"" and trying not to look stupid in front of friends...

Though the first few episodes were slow and un""Kylie-history"" related, it really picked up from there. They began delving into Kyle's background, explaining Tom, the Professor, etc. In fact, I would argue it got a little ahead of itself since it basically solved all the mysteries by the end of the first season. And the last couple are answered quite casually (ie- lack of navel and lack of memories) by the end of the season two premier, leaving little else for us to wonder about.

Not to say there isn't more happening, as we already know that Kyle is no longer one of a kind and depending where his ""sibling"" (taking a cue from Dark Angel here, where all the mutants consider each other siblings) ends up, their interaction could be a lot of fun. But unless they don't see each other for a while, Kyle and family should easily recognize someone whose story and behavior is just like his. But maybe the upgraded super-baby is smarter or learns faster? What if the ""sibling"" is taken in by someone who hates the Tagers?

My other complaint would be that while Lori and Josh took center stage the first few episodes, they've taken a total back seat since, largely because Kyle doesn't include them in his mysteries and their social problems have resolved themselves. I hope one way or another the two get brought in more. Well, that and I don't care for the mother all that much. She doesn't really do anything but ignore her kids and obsess over Kyle (and not just when he leaves to go with his ""parents."")",1308614400,,3714,4.494065281899109
2776171,5,B000NOKFGW,"The jewel in this show is how the Trager family, Kyle's adopted family, instantly becomes one's favorite television family...ever!  Stephen and Nicole Trager 's parenting provides an incredible balance that meets their children's needs.  They spend time with and listen to their children, while providing definite boundaries.  Their children, including Kyle, know they are loved; they know that home is a safe place.  At the same time, Stephen and Nicole's parenting encourages their children's independence and the development of their children's maturity.  As a result, the storylines that develop Lori's and Josh's characters, Trager children, provide meaningful experiences.  Then, of course, there is still the main character development of Kyle.  And, the viewer simply loves Kyle.  The way Kyle continually adapts from naivet to understanding is delightful since he always matures without losing a bit of his boyish and innocent charm.

2776223,5,B000NOKFGW,"It occurred in the pilot episode. Nicole Trager (played by Marguerite MacIntyre) asks Kyle (played by Matt Dallas - what a talented young actor!), the mysterious boy she has decided to take care of by bringing him into her home, what makes him scared. As he thinks back through the previous scenes, Kyle realizes and admits to Nicole, ""Everything!"". In his fear, Kyle pleads, ""Help me..."" and after a short pause calls her by the name he has heard her two children call her, ""Mom"" .
This sealed it for me. Whatever else the show would be (and there's a lot of other stuff that piqued my interest: the sci-fi stuff, the mystery-solving, etc.), this mother-son dynamic in the relationship between Nicole Trager and Kyle was always the bedrock of the show. Whatever weird or cool or scary stuff happened, the show would always return to Kyle's love for the Trager family. There are many more scenes in later episodes that cement this.
While I agree with one reviewer about the shaky moral foundation of the characters, I set this complaint aside. I have resigned myself to the fact that many in the TV industry will never truly understand the moral underpinnings that many of us as Christians hold to. (And some even don't want to understand.) Knowing this, I still watched the show and enjoyed it for what it was.
Kyle XY is a show that transcends genre. Is it science fiction? Yes. Is it a family drama? High School Teenage drama? Cloak and Dagger? Yes, yes and yes. It tries to do all of these things and more. Sometimes, I'll have to admit, the writers will emphasize one aspect of the show to the detriment of other aspects, but when they do all work together, the results are truly great (example, the episode ""Overheard"").
Kyle Xy is a show that will make you want more of it; it's really addictive. Even characters that you found less than appealing early on will become essential and down-right likeable, and you wind up pulling for them. (i.e. Declan and Foss)
In conclusion, get Kyle XY and enjoy! It has everything you could ask for in a good show: excellent casting and acting, great effects, snappy dialogue, drama, suspense, comedy, romance. And don't forget your Sour Patch Kids!",1255737600,2,2192,4.681347150259067

2776268,5,B000NOKFGW,"Kyle XY is the undeniably first family show I have ever seen that didn't get in your face with its ""I am a family show so get your kids to watch me with you"" attitude.

That's because it's not just about the family.

Kyle XY is centered around a teenager who wakes up in a forest not knowing who he is.  The  similarities to John Doe seem rampant at this point, but it's only the beginning of the pilot episode and the similarities begin to diverge from there.  He cannot talk and doesn't know anything about ""acceptable"" social behavior.  (If you've seen John Doe you know that he discovers in the first episode that he can speak just about any language and knows perfectly well how to behave with other people.)

Of course, Kyle ends up in a juvenile detention center of some kind and a child psychologist is called in.  Mrs. Trager immediately feels that Kyle requires full-time attention and gets permission to bring him into her home in a fostering situation.

Kyle thrives in this environment - despite the two teenage children of Mrs. Trager, and the mild objections of Mr. Trager at the wife bringing her work home with her.  The kids believe him to be very strange, (not the least of which is his absence of a belly button) which is true, but we can see that Kyle has a basic goodness in him that is very endearing.  He begins to communicate within a day or two.

Eventually it is discovered that he is quite the genius, so he ends up going to school with Jake and Lori - his foster siblings - and slowly becomes a part of the family.

It is also discovered that Kyle has some unique and powerful abilities that no one can explain.

There are strangers watching him and subplots galore, which will eventually gel into some explanation and new directions for the characters.

The family dramas and resolutions are a big part of this show - despite their official back seat position to the main story which is ""why Kyle is different and what that means to him and those who care about him.""

There are touching scenes and story morals in every episode, married with the show's ability to tackle real issues (such as dealing with cancer in a teenager, teenage sexual activity, and how to cultivate and maintain true friendships) and inject some biting humor and acceptably scary moments with some bad guys - or seemingly bad-but-well-meaning-parents or -administrators, etc.  These ingredients mesh together to create a show that could appeal to almost anyone - accept of course, those who think you have to have intense violence and/or sexual situations in order to have a good show.

Let me tell you, Kyle XY is a great show. Long story short: it's based around a boy (supposedly around 16, though I would guess 20 or more) who wakes up and has no idea who he is. He is taken into a foster home and learns how human behaviour works, etc.

Some bits (such as eating the banana peel with the banana) are entertaining, other things are interesting (like how Kyle develops as a person and learns what is and is not socially acceptable), and others are almost a wake-up call to our daily human behaviour (like why we lie to each other).

The main characters you are focused around are all interesting in their own way.

The only complaint I have is the backstory of who Kyle is and where he comes from. Whilst we obviously need answers for all these questions, I personally prefer the social drama and other storylines of this show.

All the antagonists of this show are cheesy, and not very well written. However, the show only focuses on them for the last few episodes of the season, and there isn't too much time forced upon them.

Hopefully the second season will either quickly answer and move on from all the questions, or have a major re-vamp on the ""baddies"" of this show.

That aside, if Kyle XY keeps up this quality, I hope it manages to last for many more seasons!",1193529600,,1491,4.341726618705036

We are enjoying this wonderful experience of Kyle XY together and we are sitting on the edge of our seats during each episode.  My 16 year old daughter has never been into watching TV very much, even when she was small.  But she is the one who had caught a couple of these episodes and asked to buy this first season DVD set.  Thank goodness they offer TV shows on DVD now or we would have missed out on a great experience.  We bought this DVD set and we were off on a great adventure, watching at least two episodes a night and then we bought this seasons episodes off of I-tunes until we got caught up to where the current season was at.  But now this second season just finished and there will be no more episodes until January.  We are wondering how we can wait that long to find out what happens next???  When this last season is available on DVD, we will buy it even though we have bought episodes of I-tunes.  The quality of watching a DVD is so much better.

This is such a refreshing surprise to have a TV show offered that is so different from anything else we have ever seen, and we all actually like the same show.

2776324,4,B000NOKFGW,"Kyle XY is, to me, guilty pleasure. It's like eating a corner piece of a wedding cake loaded with butter cream frosting. It tastes wonderful, even if it isn't any good for you.

Not that Kyle XY isn't good - it is. It's just not great, not by any standards. It can't be - not when a purportedly superb psychologist (Nicole Trager, played well and with loving sympathy by Marguerite MacIntyre) decides to leave her teenaged, irresponsible children in charge of watching someone she's just brought home from a juvenile detention center. Or any of the incredibly stupid decisions that Nicole and Stephen Trager (his ""foster"" parents) make that put Kyle in harm's way during the first few episodes.

While watching all ten episodes, I was able to point to at least five things *per episode* that no reasonable person would have done regarding Kyle - and it's not limited to the Trager's. The involvement of the police is, well, just abominable.

But there's a neat little mystery. Kyle woke up naked in the middle of a forest, and wandered into civilization, not remembering anything that happened to him prior to that point. He is the quintessential blank slate - except that he has remarkable ""powers"". He can read an entire set of encyclopedias in a day, solve impossibly difficult math problems in ten minutes, hit every basket he shoots, and fight/defend himself with a defense that Floyd Mayweather would envy (Mayweather's the guy who recently beat Oscar De La Hoya, mostly because Oscar couldn't find Mayweather, and had one heck of a time hitting someone who wasn't in the same place that he was when Oscar's punch launched). There seems to be no end to what Kyle can't do - other than remember anything about his past.

One puzzle that should have drawn much more interest by doctors than it did is Kyle's lack of a bellybutton. It separates him from everyone else.

But for all of Kyle's extraordinary talents, he is remarkably human. He seems to know the difference between right and wrong, and he can love and feel. In many ways, he is more human, and certainly more moral than most of the people his age.

I've poked some fun at the show here, and that might belie the 4-star rating I gave it. For all of the shows ineptness, it's immensely watchable, and Kyle (played by Matt ""yes this is my real name"" Dallas) is so likeable. You have to root for the guy - he's a genius who walks around looking utterly clueless most of the time. I have to wonder, though, if that's Dallas's real expression, or if it's ""acting"". From photos I saw on imdb.com, it seems to be the former.

Still, thumbs up. I loved the first season, and am anxious to see the second.",1184889600,3,2662,4.61522198731501

2776327,5,B000NOKFGW,"Warning!  Spoilers ahead!

Kaspar Hauser was a sixteen year old boy who appeared out of nowhere in early 19th century Nuremberg, Germany, barely able to walk or use his hands and with virtually no ability to speak.  There are startling similarities between Kaspar and Kyle, who likewise is roughly sixteen and initially has limited control of his body and no ability to speak.  Unlike Kaspar Hauser, Kyle proves to have an extraordinary capacity to learn, quickly mastering both his body and huge bodies of human knowledge.  And also unlike Kaspar, who never learned the secret of his origins (because he was assassinated some speculate that he may have been the offspring of a royal house--why would people go through a great deal of trouble to kill a mere peasant?), Kyle eventually learns the secret of who he is and where he came from.  At that point, as viewers of the first season will be aware, the story starts to veer over more towards DARK ANGEL, both in the sense that like Max Guevera Kyle was made rather than born.  That is not really much of a spoiler.  One of the first things we learn about Kyle is that he does not possess a belly button, leading to the rather obvious conclusion that he was never born as humans normally are.  Other parallels to DARK ANGEL will emerge in Season Two, but the most obvious resemblance between the two shows, apart from a similarity in origins, is that both series are set in Seattle but filmed in Vancouver.

The series begins with Kyle, covered with strange goo, waking up naked in the woods.  After he walks in a completely natural state into the nearby city and is placed in a juvenile detention center, the police contact a psychologist, Nicole Trager, to solicit her help in assessing Kyle.  Sensing that the juvenile center is not really appropriate for him she takes him to her home in order to serve as a temporary foster situation.  There he gets to know the other Tragers, including Nicole's husband Stephen and their two children Lori and Josh.  Much of Season One consists not only of Kyle learning to function in society but in establishing a home with the Tragers.  This continues a now-established tradition of focusing in series on what has come to be known as ""chosen families.""  It has appeared in series after series in the past decade or so.  Many have commented in regard to Admiral Adama's relationship to the various women in his command on his various ""daughters.""  But perhaps no series ever stated the theme so explicitly as BUFFY in the episode ""Family,"" in which Tara's father, brother, and cousin come to force her to return with them to their home.  When Buffy makes it known that she would not allow them to take Tara the father asks who they were to stand in the way of them, her blood kin.  ""We're family,"" she replies.  The ongoing theme through a number of shows is that the families we chose to be a part of are sometimes more important than mere blood ties.

In terms of action, not a lot happens in Season One.  Most of the focus is on Kyle learning about himself, about the world, and exploring relationships with others.  Besides the Tragers, he nurses a crush on Amanda, the girl who lives just down the street from the Tragers, and Declan, Lori's bad boy boyfriend, who gradually throughout the season becomes both less bad and an increasingly important friend to Kyle.  We also get to see an ever-expanding number of oddities about Kyle.  For instance, his ability to master any physical activity in a matter of minutes, or his propensity for sleeping in a bathtub (we find out why in Season Two), or his off the chart mathematical ability, or his ability to read any book in seconds.  And through it all, we are conscious of a mysterious individual whom we see kill one person and suspect has killed another.  We eventually learn his name is Foss and that precisely who he is demands a more complex answer than we assumed.  Foss is, by the way, played by Nicholas Lea, best known for his role as Alex Krycek on THE X-FILES.

Although the show has many strong positives, without the marvelous work of Matt Dallas in the title role the show simply wouldn't work.  Dallas manages to imbue Kyle with both a sense of wonder and a feeling of often being lost and at sea.  It is a part that would be easy to mess up, but luckily he strikes the right balance between odd and being brilliant.

I have to confess a special love for shows made in Vancouver.  More and more in recent years Hollywood has chosen to film series in Vancouver.  Partly the reason is that it is cheaper to shoot there, partly it is because there is a different kind of terrain there than in Los Angeles, and partly it is because an enormous number of actors have moved there to support the ever growing television industry there.  But although there are a lot of fine actors there, sometimes it feels as if there is just one large theater troupe, and they merely shift from one series to another as needed.  For instance, taking just two examples from KYLE XY, Amanda's mother is played by Teryl Rothery.  She played a nurse in a memorable episode of THE X-FILES from the years it was filmed in Vancouver, as well as a real estate agent both in SMALLVILLE and in DEAD LIKE ME (I have to say, the house the Tragers live in feels like it has to be in the same neighborhood as the house George's family lived in on that show), and many other series such as DA VINCI'S INQUEST, COLD CASE, and THE CHRIS ISAAK SHOW.  And she is certainly best known for having played Dr. Janet Fraiser for many seasons on STARGATE SG-1.  Eileen Pedde, who plays the professor Kyle, Lori, and Declan meet when he goes to the University of Washington, has a recurring role in BATTLESTAR GALACTICA as a marine sergeant, but has appeared on a host of other Vancouver series, including SMALLVILLE, THE DEAD ZONE, STARGATE SG-1, DARK ANGEL, THE X-FILES, and MILLENNIUM.  If you watch SMALLVILLE, DARK ANGEL, THE L WORD, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, SUPERNATURAL, the STARGATE series, HOUSE, DEAD LIKE ME, THE 4400 and all the other Vancouver shows, you will see the same performers crop up with vastly more frequency than in those filmed in Hollywood.

I highly recommend this series.  It tells a compelling story of a highly likable and sympathetic main character with finely scripted and executed stories.  The show may at times feel a bit familiar.  Certainly parts of the story bear similarities to any of a dozen or so shows of the past, but still they manage to blend all the elements together in a truly wonderful way.",1183507200,7,6551,4.5950128976784175

Unfortunately I know I'll miss some of the later episodes, so I'll have to assume season 2 will appear on DVD, too.  This DVD transfer is given in wide-screen - it wasn't shown that way on Family channel.  Despite some quibbles from other reviewers, I don't find the slightly prominent sexual situations (shown or talked about in later episodes) to be done in anything other than a tasteful way.  Matt Dallas is wonderful as Kyle.  But then, he's surrounded by a whole cast of good actors.  Jean-Luc's libido seems to be going over time, and Olivero as Declan is really well carved out.  The ending definitely points to season two.  It was my second viewing (on DVD) that finally made me realize that ""Adam"" is the guy who visits Kyle in the church.

Do I have ANY quibbles myself?  Yes.  I could have done without the constant introductions and endings of each episode.  I would also have liked to see the credits in something other than the teenee scrawl on the left of the screen.  For the record, ""extended"" final episode amounts to about one minute added footage.  The original pilot has mostly the same stuff, but with a few alternate scenes of interest.  Matt Dallas, who ""narrates"" the film, too, is not the narrator in the original pilot, and the jarring difference is troublesome.  Thenk goodness they changed that.

2776364,1,B000NOKFGW,"Josh, Kyle's `foster' brother claims Kyle must be from another planet - if so, so am I.

Forget the premise that Kyle is a Supra-genius of unknown origin.  That is what drives the show and a decent plot idea.  However, pay attention to the writing.

Poor writing and implausible stories:

A non-communicative teen shows up in the middle of downtown, naked.  He ends up in juvenile detention center in a few hours.  I do not think so - he would be in a hospital.  48 hours in the psyche ward minimum.

A woman whose job, other than `teen counselor', has no definition - gets custody of same unknown, uncommunicative teen diagnosed as having `traumatic amnesia'.  Again, I do not think so.  At least, not on the planet I live on.

Same uncommunicative traumatic amnesiac teen is identified as a possible material witness in a murder - and still, no city social worker, no hospital, no psychiatric evaluation or treatment.

That is just the first couple of episodes.

Fast forward to `Kyle Got Game' [Season 1 Episode 7].  I have two words for a `COMMUNITY CENTER' basketball coach that orders a teen player to play injured (or else) - `fired' and `lawsuit'.  (We are not talking about a high school football team in Texas - we are talking about a `Community Center' coach in suburban Seattle.)

In between are six episodes of the same shoddy, implausible writing.

Now, give reviewer `Dawn M. Christensen' - ""5 stars for adults 1 star for children"" a standing ovation - for calling it as it is.  Then I will apologize to `M, Compulsive Reader' - ""Wonder-child in an (un)Brave New World""

I am sorry, but I do not want this to ""be required viewing in every middle-school in the land with discussion following.""

Yes, the show discusses ""teenage sexuality, loyalty, truth, standing up for what's right.""

How about:

- Underage drinking until you throw up and pass out is OK.

- Teenagers having sex (with no mention of consequences - other than it was not that great)

- It is okay for teens to sneak out for the night, and to sneak opposite sex teens into their bedrooms at night.

- Masturbation is a topic of dinner conversation

- Mom's not `upset' that her 16 year old daughter is not a virgin - it is okay, - and we `know' that our `precious' 14 year old boy is still a virgin because he still keeps his porno collection hidden under his bed.

- It is no big deal that our 14 year old is `making book' (taking sports bets).

- It is okay for our 16 year old daughter to take an overnight road trip with her boyfriend and another guy without a chaperone (even if that guy is our foster son - the angelic `Kyle').

- It is okay for kids to lie to their parents.

- It is okay for kids to cheat on tests.

- It is okay for parents to lie FOR their children - to each other and in front of their children.

- The list goes on...

The only consequences for these actions by our misfit teens are the nebulous `grounding' that does not stop these kids from anything and the `no video games or internet' curse.

I must be from another planet because this is not the definition of acceptable or normal behavior OR family values.  It is certainly not something I want shown in middle school as a discussion `starter'.

Even though its rating is TV14 - it is a Family Channel staple.  Yes, there are shows that are `worse' - but most of them do not claim to be `family oriented' or `family friendly'.",1180310400,19,3392,4.4288025889967635
