6254382,5,B00I9H3W56,Not what you think- A decent Movie,1420070400,,34,4.0
6254383,4,B00I9H3W56,"Upfront, this is a very violent film. It's a revenge film, but the younger brother, Joe, seems at first much too out of life in general to get a handle on beating anybody to death, plus it doesn't seem like his style. And if you think you've seen Piggy someplace you're probably right. He's been in everything from Dr. Who to Sherlock Holmes, Game of Shadows (where he played Moriarty's right hand man.) Beating people to death, especially if he has a good excuse, is DEFINITELY Piggy's style.

This is how it goes: Joe's older brother pays him a visit while Joe is wallowing in depression and pretty much never leaving his basement flat, which must be inherited from his deceased parents as no one who isn't making a million could afford to own or pay rent on a place that size in London. Anyway, his older brother has always been his protector until one night, after convincing Joe to go with him to a pub, he insults a bunch of rival gang members (including the actor who played ""Goyle"", one of Draco's henchmen in Harry Potter) who catch up with him on his own later and yes, kick him to death. This seems to be a popular method of murder in the UK. Because gangers don't carry guns, some carry knives, but most wear Dr. Martens (also known as ""bovver boots"" and they will bovver you alright.) Using mostly their feet, these guys literally stomp your head in, break your neck, arms and rib cage and leave you there to bleed out in agony.

After the older brother's death, Joe is home one night as he normally is, when he receives a visitor (he keeps 6 locks on his door and knows no one so this is a surprise) claiming to be one of his late brother's school pals and who encourages his desire for revenge, as the perpetrators will most likely never be caught, and he calmly offers to knock them off one by one, since what they did ""wasn't right.""  He says his name is ""Piggy"" which believe it or not, is a nickname that is fairly common, along with calling someone with the last name ""White"" ""Chalkie"", or someone overweight, ""Slim"". I also wondered if Piggy was a ref to ""Lord of the Flies"" but the Piggy in this film says it's because he wears this rubber pig's nose so ""that's the last thing they see before they die"".

And die horribly they do. Joe's brother also had a girlfriend, back in the old days, that Joe had always fancied and they bond over their mutual loss; but Piggy is very single-minded and all about keeping Joe on track.

There are some twists and turns I was not expecting. The acting was over the top amazing by everyone. SO natural and yet SO out of control. They just did a terrific job telling this story, and getting you to feel what they're feeling. There is some discussion going on about Piggy's true identity and motives and this film definitely gives you something to think about. How far would you go?",1419984000,3,2838,4.408396946564886

6254385,1,B00I9H3W56,Not for me and pretty much that is all I can say about this movie. Didn't even make it 20 mins.,1419638400,,95,3.5714285714285716
6254386,4,B00I9H3W56,"When you read a vague title like PIGGY, there are many things that can spring to mind.  For me, I was expecting a slasher-type of film with the killer dressed in a pigs mask.  When I mentioned the movie to my wife, she thought it would be campy.  We were both wrong, and thats not a bad thing, I can assure you.  This film is a haunting and gripping portrait of revenge in its purest of forms.  And whether or not you agree with Piggys motives, he sure gets the job done!

I am so happy to have been wrong about this film.  It is the complete opposite of what I expected, which made it an even better movie.  And I can honestly say this is one film I will probably revisit very soon.

PIGGY is a well made revenge thriller that will keep you on your toes.  It looks great onscreen and is written well, although the pacing can be slow in parts.  The cast does an excellent job in their roles, and I have to give special recognition to Paul Anderson who portrays the titular character.  Anderson does a stellar job in his performance, and I hope to see more of his work in the future.

There is even a nice dose of gore.  We get to see some primo special effects when Piggy starts doling out his vengeance.  I am impressed with how the movie only shows glimpses of it as well; doing so, instead of shoving it in the audiences face, makes it more impactful.

PIGGY is almost a perfect movie for me.  My sole complaint, as I mentioned above, is that it can be slow in spots.  Otherwise, its a heck of a thrill-ride.  Give this one a look.",1400457600,12,1534,4.156462585034014

6254395,5,B00I9H3W56,"Excellent acting. Sort of a coming of age mixed with a revenge story.  The main character transforms slowly from a meek fellow who takes crap into a guy who gradually becomes what the Piggy character molds him mentally into. Or is that what he is really deep down inside? At any rate, I found this film to be entertaining.

6254397,4,B00I9H3W56,"Seriously, I don't know what I have to change to get Amazon to accept my review since it contains no foul language or sexual situations, but this is my final shot (after eight tries and all kinds of changes): WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD:  Vigilantes are not born, they are created. This film may take the transformation of a ""nobody"" into a ""person who kills people who need killing"" a little too far, but there have been worse cases in real life. Joe (Martin Compston) narrates the opening of the film about how his friend ""Piggy"" (Paul Anderson), whom we first see stomping a man in the face, became Joe's savior. Joe says that ""Piggy was an avenger"", but in order to get to know him, we first have to get to know Joe. Joe is your typical English bloke that no one would take a second look at. He gets a job in the mail room of a big business, where he is constantly teased and verbally assaulted by his mailroom co-workers. Every day of his miserable life, it was ""Go to work. Get numb (smoke weed). Go to sleep."". And then Joe's brother John (Neill Maskell) becomes involved in Joe's life and everything turns around for him. He is actually having fun in his life with John, playing video games, going to bars, meeting women and generally enjoying himself. An innocuous fight between John and another bloke in a bar at first seems like nothing, but then Joe's life takes a 180 turn, as he is robbed by a man with a knife (this is London, so guns are mostly out of the equation) and John is beaten up by the guy and his friends at the bar so badly while he is walking home, that Joe watches him die in the hospital. Everything good about Joe's life was taken away from him in one night. And then one night Piggy comes into Joe's life. He tells Joe that he was John's friend years ago (even having a photo to prove it and Joe says that he has faint memories of him). I know what you are thinking: Piggy is an imaginary person made up on Joe's mind like in FIGHT CLUB (1999), but you would be wrong. Piggy tells Joe that something should be done about John's death and they become close (You have to pay close attention to their relationship to get some important clues). Piggy becomes Joe's proxy vigilante, killing all those involved in John's death one-by-one, but before he kills them, he gets the name of the next victim. Piggy says he loved John and would kill for him (which he has proved), but is Joe's love for John just as strong? Piggy beats the crap out of one guy, but Joe runs away when Piggy grinds the guy's hand into the pavement with his foot. Piggy catches up with Joe and tells him what ""acceptable injury"" is and only the truly guilty should die. They come up with a plan to kidnap one of John's killers and wear pig noses as disguises, so they can get the full list of names of the killers. The film makes Piggy seem like an extension of Joe's psyche, especially when John's fiancee Claire (Louise Dylan) comes to Joe's apartment and Piggy hides from her in another room, but it has nothing to do with Joe's psyche. It has more to do with Piggy keeping his identity a secret. It's also apparent that Claire is starting to have romantic feelings for Joe, but it is too soon...for now. Joe and Piggy put their kidnap plan into effect (complete with pig noses, which will not elicit laughter in you, believe me), kidnap one of the men and bring him to a filthy mens room. Piggy tortures the guy and gets five names from him. Did Piggy just beat the crap out of this guy (like he told Joe) or kill him, as Joe is waiting outside because he's still is not ready to see such ultra-violence? Joe likes hanging out with Claire, but while they are walking down the street one night, Joe discovers the leader of John's killers, Anthony (John Herdman), walking with his girlfriend (Kate Korbel). Piggy and Joe kidnap Anthony that night, put a white hood over his head and Piggy draws a smiley face on it before he beats Anthony's head in until there is no white to be seen on the hood. Anthony screams out that Jamie (Ed Skrein) is actually the killer, but Piggy stomps on his head with his foot until he is dead. This time Joe stays and watches the whole bloody ordeal, but still ends up vomiting at the end. Joe is now a different person, who doesn't take any more crap from his fellow mailroom workers (they actually end up being scared of him). Joe and Piggy once again put their fake noses on and Joe watches as Piggy slits the throat of another bar member. Joe moves Claire into a new flat, while he and Piggy kidnap Jamie (who ends up soiling himself), who now says Danny (Tommy McDonnell) is the brains behind John's death. They hold him captive in the same dirty bathroom, when a drunk friend of Claire's walks into the bathroom and knocks Joe on his behind. It's clear by now that Claire wants a romantic relationship with Joe, but it's hard being the boyfriend of someone whose brother's killers he is disposing of. Piggy frantically tells Joe that their latest escapade has been caught on cameras, so they will have to kill Danny tonight or it will never happen. They end up killing Danny and then go quiet for a while. Joe is afraid that every knock on the door or phone call will be from the police and then Piggy shows up and says they can help other people (""We aren't done yet! We aren't ****** done yet!""). Joe screams out ""I don't even ****** know who you are!"" Turns out that Joe is correct, because when he checks out Piggy's flat when he is not there, he discovers that the photo he showed of him and John was a mock-up and the drawers are full of newspaper articles on vigilante killings dating back a couple of decades. Piggy shows up and calls Joe a ""self-made victim"" (which he is) who needed a push in the right direction to balance out the world. It seems like Piggy has been doing this kind of thing for 20 years: Picking people he sees who have suffered an unjust tragedy in their lives and the bad guys end up getting away with it. Piggy turns them into vigilantes because the law is ineffective in cases like that. Is Piggy really a bad person? Claire kisses Joe, but he tells her. ""Please don't get involved with me."" He tells Claire he is leaving for good, visits John's grave and becomes the next ""avenger to the innocent"". Yes, vigilantes are not born. They are created. Director/screenwriter Kieron Hawkes (his first feature film) makes no apologies for the extreme violence on view because all violence is extreme. This really can't be classified as a thriller or a horror film, because it could actually be viewed as a another genre of how a mild-mannered picked-on person says enough is enough and, with some major help, turns his life around. Real life doesn't end like DEATH WISH (1974). Still, this film is pretty good and you'll need a strong stomach for some of the violent scenes, but what is truly scary is that there may be vigilantes out there teaching other people how to be vigilantes. I believe that is what Kieron Hawkes was trying to convey here. A mousy little man could become a cold-blooded killer with just a little prying. That should scare everybody.

6254406,1,B00I9H3W56,"The new ""Clockwork Orange"" so it has been said, Piggy really doesn't gain anything from the comparisons, which are deluded and fatuous. From the Extras, first-time director Kieron Hawkes seems an affable enough bloke, wanting to make films for years and then realising that British audiences liked on-screen savagery.  So we get Piggy. Stanley Kubrick, watch out. Maybe in time Kieron will give us a  film as haunting as The Shining. I doubt it on the basis of this. A  tasteful, piano-led  score helps us through the first 15 minutes. as shy boy Joe (Martin Compston) struggles with Camden and the world in general, living alone, doing a routine messenger job. At least he's got his bruv, John, Neil Maskell, back from nearly getting a bullet in St George's Day. But John gets set on by pub bullies. He never comes out of hospital, leaving Joe and John's gilrfriend Claire bereft. So far, so watchable. But then in comes Paul Anderson's Piggy. Is he really John's old mate from way back, a redeeming angel of death, a  super-hero gone wrong, or, gulp, a ballsy alter ego for wimpy (but getting there) Joe? On go the piggy noses and we get a predictable slaughter trail, each killing nastier than the last. Actors talk warmly of the prosthetics on offer, Good to know it wasn't all for real. Roland Manookian is in there somewhere, probably getting butchered. ""Everyone on production did an amazing job"",said Kieron, with understandable pride..
