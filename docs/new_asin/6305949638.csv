1103144,5,6305949638,"Toby McGuire is a fine young actor and absolutely superb teamed with the great Michale Caine. The supporting cast of the film is composed of many familiar faces, and each adult and child did a fine job.
The story is set  in an orphanage in New England sometime early in the 20th Century.  Unlike  some ""film"" orphanages, this one is run by caring adults. One of  the strengths of the film is that it accurately portrays the real sorrow of  being an orphan, which sooner or later we all are, but which is  particularly hard on children. The staff at the orphanage compose an  extended family of sorts, but new children are coming, and old friends are  leaving, and there is little continuity or security. And, there is always  the hope that tommorrow some beautiful couple will choose you for their  child.
Michael Caine, the loving doctor and surrogate father who heads  the orphanage staff is also a doctor who performs abortions. Every girl who  comes to the orphanage pregnant has the option of having the child or  having an abortion. This film has been described as ""pro-choice""  and that's too simplistic. It doesn't advocate abortion as much as it  demonstrates that there are valid reasons why some women might need to  undergo this proceedure. It is a complex film, not for the faint of heart.
In a subplot that actually ""explains"" the final turn of the  main character's life, a parent behaves irresponsibly toward his daughter.  I found his behavior disgusting, and I found him repellent. This event was  critical to the plotline, but I hate to be reminded of it. I don't know how  it was handled in the book, but I think it might have worked better if we  had known the father a little less well.

1103145,4,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is a  very well done movie .Michael Caine is simply excellent. Tobey Maguire shows in this movie that he has deeply improved since Pleasantville. Charlize Theron is really a pleasant surprise in the  new Hollywood panorama. She is the living proof that some top models can  become little by little very good actresses. As far as the themes of incest  and abortion are concerned ,I partly agree with those reviewers who  criticize the scarce deepening of these two important problems,but I also  think that their investigation is not always strictly necessary In my  opinion there are in this movie other very important themes. For example:is  it really important to follow absurd rules?(Those written on the sheet of  paper).Is it wise for us to stay in a comfortable place for a long time  without seeing anything else in our life?And besides don't you find that  Homer has been somewhat ungrateful towards his  ""creator""Dr. Larch?I mean,according to me he left him too  soon,after all,Homer's new life is not exactly Pleasantville.",961113600,,1055,5.063953488372093

Homer falls for Charlize Theron's character  (who wouldn't?) and he leaves the only home he has ever known.  He enjoys  his life outside of the New England orphanage and belives he is making  something for himself.

1103148,3,6305949638,"Read a few pages of John Irving's wonderful novel The Cider House Rules  and you may decide that novel is not worth reading. The reason why the book  as a whole was such a success is the familiarity the reader builds over 718  pages. The quirks of its many characters, the acute sense of time and  place, its many subplots and sly observations about human nature and  self-rightousness. This is precisely why Lasse Hallstrom's gently charming  film is essentially a failure, it is impossible to adapt such a sprawling  novel into the movie without either having an atrociously long running time  or making the whole thing into a fast paced incomprehensible mess. The  screenplay by Irving himself leaves out a lot of the book (most  distressingly the colorful, butch and gripping character of Melony), yet  still fails to be an adequate adaptation for the screen. The film feels  like what it really is, a large work of literature compressed and condensed  into a small number of scenes, themes are lost and charcaters  distilled.
  For those of you who haven't read the book, the film is  still annoyingly thin, never really discussing the issues it raises, all  the performances (with the exception of Michael Caine) hardly register. Yes  it looks gorgeous and the kids are cute(a little too cute), but does this  supposed coming of age tale amount to anything? Not really.
  Arguably  the most bizzare Oscar nomination of the nineties must be that of Best  Director for Lasse Hallstrom. There is a pretty thick line between being  subtle and doing absolutly nothing, and his direction here is straight  forward its virtually non-existant, which is partially responsible for the  film's unclear message. Considering that the academy ignored a pair of  spectacular directing jobs by David Russel for Three Kings and Daivid  Fincher for Fight Club this is unforgivable. Crazier still is John Irving's  oscar win for the script, as it is far from being cinematic, but  degenerates into an arbitrary series of events touching the bases but never  exploring similar events in the novel.
  To be honest, I've given much  better films (like Snow Falling on Cedars) the same 3 star I awarded this  one becuase I can't get myself to give it the dismissive 2 stars. Take my 3  stars as a weak reccomendation for a rental. Watching this film is a  pleasent experience, but when you get right down to it, its also an empty  one.",960249600,,2418,4.847665847665848
1103149,2,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is not so much a good film as it a well marketed film. Released at Christmas time with massive publicity by Miramax, this is a totally average film that audiences just lapped up.
Michael Caine plays  a mild mannered doctor who is also the head of a New England orphanage. The  films driving force lies between the relationship of Caine and Tobey  Maguire, an orphan of his. As Tobey grows, Caine teaches him how to be a  doctor. Caine also notices that Maguire has an uncharacteristically good  relationship with the other orphans, very Father like.
As Maguire grows  he longs to experince life away from the orphanage. He discovers romance  while assuming a job as an apple picker. Along the way he is caught in a  web of secrets and lies involving his new co-workers (Delroy Lindo doing a  bad job.)
There are, I suppose several surprises to The Cider House  Rules. None of them are particularly earth shattering but I will not spoil  them anyway.
That just about sums up the general idea to The Cider House  Rules. When it ended I was forced to ask myself why so many people liked  this film? The answer lies in the same reason so many embraced The Green  Mile. ""Cider House,"" like The Green Mile is a cliche ridden movie  that manipulates the audience throughout. It has a warm fuzzy feeling to it  that is the type of thing that mainstream audiences seem to  love.
Unfortunately I found that the movie was dull, boring and  uninspired. Caine is good but not Oscar worthy and everything about this  film is totally average.
I especially despised the ""Kings of New  England"" line that was repeated throughout by Michael Caine. I can  just picture someone thinking, ""OK I need a great line here that this  movie will be remmebered by."" This is the result and it is  garbage.

1103254,5,6305949638,"Review of The Cider House Rules
Hot Toasty Rag, November 27, 2017

The Cider House Rules is a beautiful, beautiful film. Based on John Irvings novel, its set in the years before WWII, as a boy whos spent his entire life in an orphanage chooses to explore the outside world. Its extremely difficult to sum up the story, or even to describe central themes, because this film means so many different things to different people. For some, its about the relationship with between a father and son, how the father tries to impart his wisdom, and how the son wants to forge his own path. For others, its a story of youth and maturity. Others still will look at it as a historical film preserving a way of life that doesnt exist anymore.

While it lost the Oscar in 2000 for Best Picture to American Beauty, it won gold statues for Adapted Screenplay and Supporting Actor; the latter was a highly competitive contest, including Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Ill leave it to you to decide which extremely talented performance deserved the award that year, but if I had my way, Id have given a two-way tie, plus a special award for Outstanding Juvenile Performance. If you read the book of The Cider House Rules, youll see that Michael Caines character is actually the lead in the story, but in the long, complicated process of turning his novel into a screenplay, John Irving made the focus of the story Tobey Maguires journey. Michael Caine is still the heart and soul of the film; his lines are the most memorable long after you leave the theater, and his scenes inspire the most tears.

Tobey Maguire, who was not even nominated that year, also completely embodies his role. Hes raw and emotional, mature in some ways but completely inexperienced in others. Its truly exhausting to watch this film, because as Tobey lives through his imprinting experiences, his face shows every hurt.

Lasse Hallstrom, whose films are sometimes a little more sweet than serious, gives incredible love and care to his direction. The colors are beautiful, paying tribute to New England, and the scene transitions are smooth, paying tribute to the time period in which the film is set. He compiled a star-studded supporting cast, all of whom are authentic and full of emotion: Paul Rudd, Kathy Baker, Jane Alexander, Kate Nelligan, Delroy Lindo, Erykah Badu, and J.K. Simmons. Charlize Theron plays the love interest, and while I don't happen to like her as an actress, she doesnt really detract from the film too much. Theres so much more to love, so whenever I watch it, I concentrate on the other cast members, the poignant and heart-wrenching script, beautiful music, and lovely scenery.

I watched the film before reading the novel, and as much as I absolutely love the book, I recommend watching the film first. The novel spans decades, and if you read it first, youll probably be disappointed that certain plot points and characters are cut out. The book starts decades before the film, and continues decades after the ending. However, watching the film first allows you to fall in love with the story and then learn more about it. I love both versions of The Cider House Rules, even though it inspires buckets of tears every time I watch and read it. Its so incredibly lovely, and its so rare that this degree of near-perfection is reached.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult subject matter, a rather intense sex scene, and scenes of abortion, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1511740800,,3565,4.751211631663974

But the plot is contrived, and classic Hollywood beat-you-over-the-head agenda. Although the common synopses put out mention nothing of the sort, the movie is essentially a pro-choice social engineering film. It's all about abortion.  Abundant with what modern people seem to value as ""complex characters,"" (even the good guys are bad), the only character of worth ends up betrayed and paralyzed. Near the end of the film, it goes all Hamlet and people start dying left and right, at least one with little dramatic purpose, and by the end of the film, we are left with the implied message that growing up entails being pro-abortion. Rape, incest, abortion, death. It's a real misery fest. I heard this was a decent movie, but after subjecting my wife to this, I lost my chance to pick the next film. Honestly, it was horrible. I gave it two stars since it was a quality production, but a well done misery fest is still a misery fest. Do yourself a favor and pick something more enriching.",1483401600,,1159,4.766169154228856

If you grew up watching the Walton's and enjoyed it, this movie will take you back to the days when life seemed simpler and the focus was on the human spirit. The movie focuses on the inner struggle we face as we mature and find ourselves. It reminds us that what we yearn for isn't always what we need or should do with our lives. Contentment can sometimes be found where we least expect it. It's a movie with a great cast and a great message.

This time, I had two friends who, as usual, couldn't decide which of my watch list movies they might like.  I finally said I'd always wanted to watch this movie so how about we just go for it! We did, and we all loved it. Even though we were hoping for something a little more humorous and lighthearted, this had those moments along with the more serious issues. Since all was made to come to a satisfactory conclusion, there was no cause for that ""after-movie depressed feeling"". Michael Caine and Tobey McGuire were excellent in their roles, as were all the other cast members including the children. The pace never dragged and there were many stories within the main story.

The film also does a great job of portraying the range of emotions and choices women had in that time concerning an unwanted pregnancy. The love triangle is a realistic picture of the wartime romances of that time, and the migrant workers lot also seems an accurate presentation.

1105072,5,6305949638,"This movie is deep, much deeper than the one star reviewers can fathom as they obviously missed the point.  This movie examines formal rules set by people for situations they cannot relate to or understand.  This includes rules for a hot smelly cider house inhabited by folks who cannot read and written by someone who has not experienced the living conditions therein.  This includes rules of society for abortion written by those who cannot fathom all the ways an ignorant inexperienced young girl can become pregnant against her intentions and sometimes her will, nor the feelings, desperation, and actions that follow.  This also includes the rules that favor formal versus apprentice training, where some of the more capable people have experience rather than a formal degree.  The rules of morality are examined as they relate to unwanted children,  boyfriend and girlfriend, and father and daughter,  basically showing that creating a selfish morale code is harmful all around and eventually hurts both innocents and the perpetrator.",1480636800,2,1040,5.266666666666667
1105073,1,6305949638,"Boo!  Such a bad movie.  The scenery is the only reason it deserves 1 star.  The cinematography and acting were fine but the story is horrible.  It displays the worst actions of humanity and their consequences but with no redemption.  Anybody who has eyes can see all of these tragedies taking place all around us in the real world.  But this movie leaves you with a sense of hopelessness.  People die, commit suicide, run away, lose children, and get paralyzed.  I guess when the main character (spoiler alert) returns to the orphanage in the last five minutes, everything is supposed to be fine...except that he's a fake doctor!  So dumb.  And as for the name ""Cider House Rules"", it has to due with poor, uneducated workers who have no respect for their employer.  They ignore the fact that their housing and income are provided by someone who ask them to follow a few simple rules that are intended to keep them safe.

1105153,3,6305949638,"I had seen previews for this movie years ago and somehow got the impression that I wanted to see it. I did not until this viewing today when I found it in Amazon Prime. I won't say that it wasn't interesting, because it definitely was interesting, just not necessarily enjoyable.  At the very beginning, when Homer was being named and Dr. Larch was caring for the boys, I got the impression that this was going to be an uplifting movie. It didn't take long for me to find out that I was mistaken. The musical score throughout shows, however, that the filmmakers believe it to be uplifting. I believe that the reason for most of this is a difference in values. While I saw the children in the orphanage all as perfect, some would see them as a problem for society to have to deal with and/or beings with a quality of life destined to remain so poor that they would be better off had they not been born unless they find some way to ""be of use"" to others. It smacks of Eugenics. Drug use, abortions, incest, cheating on a significant other while they are away at war, and lying are all romanticized heavily with an ""ends justify the means"" attitude. Rules are meant to be broken?  Depends on the rules. In my world, the immoral rules are the ones worth breaking and there are plenty of them. If Margaret Sanger who founded Planned Parenthood is a historical heroine of yours, then you will probably enjoy this film immensely.  While I have no problem watching movies or reading books that don't follow the same world-view as my own or that include what I would consider to be immoral activity, I had a hard time enjoying a movie whose sole purpose seems to be either to inspire future doctors who will provide abortions or praise those who already do in a form of hero worship.

The movie could have a been so much more if it was more plot heavy and showed the events that it did with out the musical score and camera work that made it seem more like something that should inspire all of us to our highest selves. We are all broken and that is why characters that are human are so appealing to us. These characters had their humanity stripped away from them in that instead of being broken; it seems like the point was that whatever someone is, they are not broken.",1479427200,2,2262,4.404306220095694

1105330,5,6305949638,"I was attracted to this movie because it was the story about the life of a boy who grew up in an orphanage.  I've always felt sorry for kids who grew up without a Mom or Dad, which is the main character Tobey McQuire played.  Luckily for him, he grew up and was surrounded by loving nurses and an on-site doctor who thought of him as a son.  He learned so much from the doctor, that he became a doctor himself without ever having gone to medical school.  But, he wanted to see more of the world and parted ways with the orphanage.  He didn't go too far from home and experienced a different way of life for a little while until he felt obliged to return as the head doctor at the orphanage.  It's a very good, old fashioned-type movie if you're tired of all the drama you find in today's movies/shows.  I would highly recommend it after a long, harrowing week of work.  It's a low stress movie that's sweet, fairly innocent and doesn't leave you feeling anxious after watching it.",1475798400,5,980,4.316939890710382

I saw this movie years ago, when it first came out and was mesmerized with this character driven , beautifully scored, subtly and superbly directed , cinematic work of art.  I watched it again today, and felt even more moved.  For the author, John Irving, to be able to unabashedly address these subject matters with such honesty, integrity in an unaffected way was no small task.  Especially with such delicate subject matter.  I was not once offended.
I hope it won an academy award for the writing, and actually, for many categories.  I'll check that information out later.  But for now, the journey of the these characters was compelling.  I will definitely watch it again in the future. It's a lot to take in.  It's views like a classic film.  Deep, rich and real.

1105962,4,6305949638,"IMDB says that John Irving wrote both the book and the screenplay. Unbelievable. All I can say is, it must have gotten chopped by some editor hepped up on goofballs, because it makes almost no sense whatsoever, and I can't believe an author would butcher his own story. But I haven't read the book, so maybe that was flawed to start with. But there were so many good actors in this movie you kind of just had to watch it. Especially the kids in the orphanage and the apple-picking crew were top notch. And you get to see a gorgeous shot of Charlize Theron where she looks like a cross between a Reubens and Marilyn Monroe; it's just stunning. (Although I wonder if that's really her, because the way she turns her head it looks like it might have been chopped.) Some of my faves were: Delroy Lindo, Erykah Badu, Paz de la Huerta, Kathy Baker, and little Curly. Everyone was good. Paul Rudd got to play a regular guy instead of a dweeb; that was a treat. And you got to see 'Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle.'

I had a chuckle at the end of the movie, when the Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron characters split up. Both looked forward to a life of taking care of others: Theron's character would take care of her paraplegic fiance/soon-to-be husband, and Maguire's character would take care of the orphans. It occurred to me that, after a few years, those two characters would be getting together again to re-ignite a little of the old magic. Because it was clear, in the end, that both of them were boxing themselves into lives of saint-like service.

Even though this isn't the type of movie that I would routinely go for, theres something really heartfelt and genuine about this movie that really must be experienced and felt to understand.

The Homer character is something of an everyman who questions what else is possibly out there for himself even as the well-meaning advice of those who seek to protect us whether it be parents or mentors? In this way, the Cider House Rules really yanks on the heartstrings and really keeps the watcher glued to the screen for the entire two + hours.

1106742,2,6305949638,"This review contains spoilers about the plot. This movie earns two stars only because I couldn't ignore the well-done production of the film. The score and scenery are beautiful and the acting is compelling. It is a moving drama if only because of the individual components that make up a movie. However, if I rated this movie on message alone there would be no stars. The basic message of this story is that everyone deserves to make up their own rules- truth and right and wrong are purely circumstantial. We don't (and can't) live in such a reality and to have it presented as a glimpse of what ""should be"" is very naive and deceptive. The movie is heavy on the topic of abortion: doesn't abortion really help women in need? The two heroes of the film (Caine and McGuire) believe that it does, although one holds that belief from the start and the other comes to that conclusion through a series of events. Caine, the resident doctor/father-figure, encourages McGuire, the budding young man, to suspend what is true and right as opportunities to ""play God"" arise. The long-term good gives way to what appears to be the most pressing need at the moment and lives are lost to a warped sense of truth and morality. Caine is openly anti-Christian and unrelentingly hounds McGuire to become his protege in the field of abortion, though McGuire resists at first. Though Caine himself is portrayed as sort of a tortured soul (getting high on ether on a regular basis and having a fairly pessimistic view of life), nonetheless he comes off as the ""hero"" who lives by his own code in order to ""save"" others from their circumstances (whether it's lying to them or performing abortions or forging credentials to deceive the board). He does what is right in his own eyes regardless of the consequences to others, denying them the freedom to makes choices for themselves based on the truth...all the while maintaining his caring and protective persona. McGuire at first resists this perspective and ends up going ""out into the world"" to see what life is really like. Based on the tone set thus far, it's no surprise that McGuire comes to face difficult circumstances that seem to confirm Caine's perspective on life. McGuire yields to the view that right and wrong are circumstantial (this point is plainly verbalized and embraced in a scene regarding the ""cider house rules"") and not only performs his first solo abortion but agrees to cover up the circumstances of a crime/death. It sounds very seedy but it is all portrayed as the most natural, caring thing and his character is all the more respected for his actions. He gains a sense of confidence in his newly found (lack of) ethics and when Caine's character dies (from overdosing on ether, no less), McGuire takes on his position and role. Ironically, all of this happens in the context of an orphanage where all the ""unwanted"" children actually seem to live a happy live with each other...though the idea that being alive in any circumstance is better than being aborted is actually scoffed at, even in front of one of the other orphans. The more I think about the subtle (and blatant) messages of this film, the more I dislike the movie. It presents a very twisted perspective in a very compelling, artistic fashion that will no doubt draw many into its deceptive and false ethic. Wherever you stand on the issue of abortion, the perspective presented in this film, though it hinges on abortion, has farther-reaching consequences as it calls into question morality as a whole. A very irresponsible perspective on life is glorified, and that is very disappointing. The only true value of this film is in its wealth of false arguments to be discussed and, ultimately, rejected as hollow, harmful, selfish and unrealistic, and in the discussion that could be had of the subtle and compelling way in which those arguments are presented so as to make them look true.",1449014400,5,3911,4.78698224852071

This movie isn't about abortion.  I can understand a pro-life advocate seeing it as a movie with a pro-choice message - because it has one.  Undeniably, the pro-life protagonist is in a sense ""converted"" when faced with the apex pro-choice situation so often put forward.  The toll that the decisions take on each character is almost palpable and the task that many consider morally appalling is not approached with casual insensitivity.  Generally, the question is ""is this life or not?""  In this story, the deeper question was ""is just any life worth living?""  Certainly, the abortion sub-plot was designed to be the prime example, but it was not the most resonating element.

The stronger message that should touch any adult is the tragic but beautiful decisions we all make in life.  Most of us have a deep desire to taste the world; we have a desire to explore and live the life we dream of.  There is a prevalent message in society that it is worth abandoning all else in order to achieve those dreams.  The beauty of this film is the recognition that that isn't what most of choose because we are compelled to do otherwise.  There is nothing inherently wrong with chasing dreams and feeding the hunger of wanderlust.  But when your calling is to tend to the orphans in Maine, then all the searching outside of those walls won't fulfill the deeper hunger.

The obvious symbolism of the incineration of the arbitrary rules placed over the lowest caste may reach too far if it applies to abortion (then illegal) alone.  What I found more compelling was the message, intended or not, that humans can argue over what policies and rules are right, but the people who really sacrifice in order to fulfill their noble callings that truly live.  Life on the orchard offered a more classicly rich experience with wealth and a beautiful woman - but inside it was impotent.  It was life at the orphanage, interacting with the abandoned and apparent broken that offered the protagonist real life.",1441152000,4,2030,4.773638968481375

However, this world is too narrow for him and he decides to experience the ""outside"" world. After all he is a young man and past the age of adoption. The second world war is brewing but he is not physically eligible (bad heart).He leaves this world of its daily repetiveness. Homer leaves and now he hopes to experience the entire gambit of emotions from the people he will meet and touch. Romantic love, joy, heartache, and friendship,to name a few await him. He is not prepared for some of the powerful negative emotions that will come with each one of these new experiences. Homer is needed in this outside world as much as he was needed at the orphanage. The difference being not much is predictable in this new setting. At first this is very attractive to him . His eyes are wide open. He wants to take in everything. But he is not prepared to handle all these new wonders with the disappointments that goes with each new experience. At the orphanage which is  managed by his father figure (played brillantly by Michael Caine )cannot understand why Homer wants to put himself through all the pain this outside world will throw at him. There are now decisions Homer will have to make to survive in this new world . This world has people of color which the orphanage did not. There are beautiful young women that now he can try and build a relationship . There are co workers , bosses, new people he knows he will meet. He expects the joy and the pleasure of new relationships  but does not realize that there can also be real pain in these new relationships. At the orphanage he was a practicing doctor and now on the outside he is an apple picker .He seems happy at first but life plays dirty tricks with which Homer is forced to deal. There are painful decisions to be made. This is all very confusing for him. The question becomes where was he the most happy and where was he needed the most. Which world offers him true happiness and a sense of belonging.",1439596800,11,2482,4.43859649122807

1107523,5,6305949638,"Dr. Wilbur Larch, a graduate from Harvard Medical School, was an accomplished gynecological and obstetrical surgeon with experience in pediatric care. He was the administrative coordinator of the St. Cloud's Orphanage in rural Maine. Infants and children living there are adopted by mostly infertile couples. Dr. Larch delivered babies and on rare occasions performed abortions. The staff and utilitarian doctor home-schooled the orphaned children. Dr. Larch taught his medical skills to a particularly adept and astute orphan named Homer Wells. Homer was born in 1922 at St. Cloud's. By the time he reached early adulthood, Homer had been judged a skilled and gifted surgeon with near perfect, impeccable obstetrical and gynecological procedure. He had never been to medical school or even high school and had no diplomas. His duties and responsibilities as Dr. Larch's assistant become unbearably ennui and perfunctory. So he left the orphanage and all the children he was so close to and went to work at an apple orchard farm. He worked with immigrant crews that travelled up and down the East coast for seasonal harvesting of crops. Apples were picked and culled at their peak of ripeness and some were ground-up for apple cider vinegar. Homer becomes acquainted with the son of the affluent owners of the apple orchard. The son's name was Wally Worthington, he was a Lieutenant during the war, and he flew the B-24 Liberator aircraft. Wally's wife name was Candy, and Homer and Candy become intimately involved while Wally was away flying combat missions over Burma. Candy was enchanted and beguiled by Homer's insular and parochial idiosyncratic disposition. Candy was quite the opposite; she was rich, sophisticated, and worldly. They were in love and so happy. You want them to be together, because you feel their potent, wistful need for each other. Part of the movie is like ""12 Years a Slave,"" however, I would rate ""The Cider House Rules"" as a better film.",1439510400,,1968,5.114906832298137

1107721,5,6305949638,"Sixty years before the release of ""The Cider House Rules"", we learned in a heartwarming story, from a girl named Dorothy, that if we are ever looking for our heart's content we shouldn't look past our own back yards. In 1999, in another heartwarming but more adult tale, a young man named Homer sets his cap to see the world and discovers also, that home is where he belongs.

All that Homer Wells knows of life is the orphanage in Maine where he has grown up. The orphanage is run by Dr. Larch who has been like a father to Homer and has passed on  his medical knowledge to him, in hopes that someday Homer will take his place. The orphanage by the way also doubles as place where unwed mothers come to have their babies...or not...as abortion is also one of the choices. The time is the early fourties, and not only was abortion as controversial as it still is today, but also, illegal.

Homer feels it is his time now, and decides to strike out on his own. Not knowing where he will go or what he will do, doesn't really matter. What matters is that he experiences life. And so he does. Love, happiness, sadness and loss are all part of life's experiences that Homer gains on his journey.

Lasse Hallstrom(""Chocolat""/""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"")has masterfully directed this wonderful film that captivates from start to finish. The cast is a brillant mix of seasoned veterans and outstanding young performers. Michael Caine took home a Best Supporting Oscar for his touching portrayal of the ether addicted, but caring Dr. Larch. Tobey Maguire, is perfect as the young and intuitive Homer. Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, and Kathy Baker all add their wonderful talents as well. The film also garnered an Oscar for Best Screenplay by John Irving and was nominated for several others including, Best Picture, Director,and Music.
It's not only a beautiful story, but beautifully filmed as well.

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves touching tales of life.

1108043,5,6305949638,"This is one of the best films I've seen in the last five years.  It's a story about love, innocence, protection, curiosity,  emotional ""collateral damage,"" and knowing where and with whom you belong.

It's in the general category of ""innocent abroad"" films like ""Being There"" and ""Forrest Gump."" But it's by far the best of the lot, if only because the characters all seem so real.  Most of all, it's a story about how human beings cope with the hands they've been dealt, sometimes with great courage but often with selfishness and duplicity.

The title (""The Cider House Rules"") is a masterful allegory for the rules of law and religion that we (or most of us) think ought to govern our lives.  In the course of the film, the characters violate many of them.  But everything makes sense in context, leaving the viewer with nagging doubt about any moral absolutism.

I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, so I won't say much more.  Suffice it to say that this film is brilliant on so many levelsemotional, dramatic, moral, philosophical and practicalwithout ever getting preachy or didactic.  The script and acting are superb.  And the sound management, unlike that of most modern movies, leaves dialogue in the foreground.  The actors enunciate and project, as actors should but most today don't.

But the story is very human, and filled with lots of love, I saw it a long time ago, and when you showed it, I had to see it again, and I enjoyed it, not as much the second time.  But I am from that age, when people use to deliver babies, like that, and adopt similarly, or I heard about it when young pregnant girls dropped out of our small town, and went away to deliver their babies, and then came home and acted like they were away to visit a aunt in Denver. It was a very interesting movie, the acting was very good down to earth, Sad about the black girl, baby and her father, men sometimes are beast, have no sense of self control.  Ought to have a test to be a father sometimes, but even that wouldn't work.",1429920000,,1028,4.104477611940299

His character makes a mistake leading to their visit to the orphanage, but he turns out to be a great guy and a hero of WWII. Tobey Maguire does a great job as the hero of the story and Charlize Theron is amazing (awesome nude shot of her back side in one scene).

I have been a Bible student and teacher for over 40 years. I do feel I understand each of these forums from God's point of view and I believe the artists of this film in both the writing and acting were inspired by God to present this film exactly as it is. The cider house rules were made by those who never served in the cider house. The morals here being that you cannot step into the same river twice, and unless you have walked in another man's shoes you will never understand his way. Our own commitment to God is exactly that, our own. Each of us will be rewarded according to the deeds we have chosen for ourselves. Only wisdom from God can help us and only if we ask for it.

1108746,1,6305949638,"I couldn't see any redeeming value in any of the characters.  Paul Rudd's and Charlize Theron's characters regarded their child's life as a by-product of their sexual union that they wanted to get rid of by killing him/her.  Michael Caine's character did care for the orphans but also didn't hesitate to kill children if that's what the mother/father wanted.  The incest was bad, and Charlize Theron's character had to confront the father.  She also needed to look at her own life.  She allowed somebody to take her child's life and was then unfaithful to her husband while he was away.  Toby McGuire's character was just as bad in his adulterous behavior.  Couldn't watch the whole movie.  I had no sympathy for any of the main characters when they made terrible choices.  I would not expect anyone to feel sorry for me if I screwed up, but only to pray for me that I would be forgiven and would repent from my wicked ways.",1424390400,3,924,4.619631901840491

I had a splitting headaches(migraine) and needed to reabsorb my head into any story that kept my attention,  be it other peoples failures/succesess etc. .

1108921,5,6305949638,"I always read the one star reviews first on any movie or product on Amazon; of course, in the case of this movie, the one star reviews mostly want to tell the world all about ""morals"", ""rules"" and ""consequences"" of behavior.  These people, is can be assumed, think they are paragons of virtue because they condemn those who have ""fallen"".  These same people, I suspect, would call themselves Christians, which is pretty funny because it is in direct opposition to the basic teachings of Jesus regarding forgiveness and not judging others.  I would get a kick out of this utter non-Christian behavior if it wasn't for the fact that they wreak havoc on others with their hateful views while hiding behind the label of ""Christianity"".  Christ just doesn't deserve all the horrors that have been and continues to be done in His name.

That said, yes, the movie was an idealized view of life at the time relating to the treatment of orphans, blacks, women, and others who didn't have a voice in our so called democracy (we're still trying to get to a better place hundreds of years after the brilliant founders of our nation created the blueprint for an enlightened society).  It surely was not and is still not sadly this way at all.  Though it IS sentimental, it is theatre, which has a purpose to show us who we are and who we are not.  It fulfilled its purpose because it shows the way the better nature of human beings can allow for better and brighter lives if forgiveness and love are the guiding principles.

People who condemn others for what they consider transgressions of man-made ""rules"" and ""morals"" ignore the fact that humans as well as all other beings are driven to procreate in order to survive.  This is just a biological fact.  The trouble starts when individuals in power decide create a system that is in contradiction with this fact.  Yes, there is a reason why human children need to be born into an environment that can support them physically and mentally as a human child requires a lot of resources to get them to adulthood, hence  marriage is one institution that exists for that purpose; however, it just doesn't always work that way.  As thinking beings, there needs to be allowances made for that fact that not every child is going to be born into fortunate circumstances (and marriage doesn't necessarily make for a nurturing environment for children either).  Instead, we punish the women and the children by calling them names like ""slut"" and ""bastard"" and treat them as if they were pariahs while often patting the men on the back as having proved their manhood.  I notice that the handsome wealthy fly-boy, although taking enough responsibility to get the pregnant girl to a doctor so she would be cared for, was portrayed as a dare devil and a war hero.  Since this movie is sentimental, the too often unfortunate route that is taken by men is abandonment of the women they have sex with and the children that are the result.",1418428800,,2959,4.681467181467181

1109054,5,6305949638,"I have to agree with another reviewer about this movie. From the doctor of the childrens' home, portrayed by Michael Caine to most of the remaining characters, you will find a flaw, even if a minute one, in every single one of them. The birth of unwanted pregnancies that results in homeless children was poignant, and heart-wretching. Some are adopted, while others are not. This movie portrayed the doctor of the clinic and his unselfishness in taking it upon himself to be mother and father, in a sense, to each child born in his home. He loved them all and wept for them. Michael Caine is superb in the doctor's role. As far as the homeless children, there is not much in detail. The movie focuses, for the most part, on the adults--young or older,  and the errors in decisions that are made by each. All have his or her own prices to pay for individual flaws possessed. It is indeed an epic film, which I highly recommend.",1414540800,,927,4.517857142857143

1109124,2,6305949638,"The acting was very good. The underlying messages of this film, however, were not. The main message of this film was repeated justification of abortion. All main characters seemed to consider abortion as the only solution to the consequences of their immoral behavior. Even the sub-plot abortion due to an incestuous relationship between a father and his daughter left an erroneous message. Although a valid case can be made for abortion in the case of incest, the message the film left was that abortion was the only solution. In both cases the option to preserve a human life was never mentioned even though adoption was frequently mentioned throughout the film. Films like this only serve to give approval to immoral behavior and justify in the public's mind the notion that human life is of little value when so-called responsible adults find the preservation of life inconvenient.

1109206,5,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is a film based on John Irving's novel of the same title. It tells the story about Homer,who is an orphan in remote St. Cloud, Maine. Never adopted,he becomes the favorite of orphanage director Dr. Larch, who imparts his full medical knowledge on Homer,who becomes a skilled but clearly and unschooled and unlicensed physician. Conflict starts when he tries to practice his knowledge outside the orphanage.

The movie is a classic probably for liberal viewers. This is where the controversy starts especially when Homer practices abortion and the film not condemning it for theme is about the choices we make about life and the results and consequences that will bring us later in life..Aside from abortion,it also tackles many other themes such incest,suicide,adultery and morality in a very cohesive fashion that it was able to maintain its single-mindedness in promoting its message about the choices we make. While others may find the choices made by the characters flawed and disturbing especially for conservative viewers and will probably be disappointed with it. But regardless of what political beliefs of the viewers,it still stays true to the message and the theme never gets lost. Credit the great film adaptation by the writers of the film.

Aside from the reasons mentioned above,the performances of the cast were great. No wonder Michael Caine won an Academy Award for it. But the brilliance of the cast is not limited to him. Everyone in the film were great in portraying their characters as the audience would likely empathize with the choices they are making in life.

Finally,I think that anyone who saw the film would probably go through a deep thought later about the decisions and choices we make in life. I doubt that anyone who saw this would probably not be affected by it whether they agree or disagree with the characters of the film. THIS MAKES IT AN EXTRAORDINARY FILM!!!!! A classic indeed.",1406160000,2,1942,5.006191950464396

1109208,4,6305949638,"Lovely film exploration of a young man's growth and coming to terms with his responsibilities in life, anchored by the always dependable Michael Caine (sans British accent) and a very young Tobey Maguire. Maguire, who at the time of filming was a bit out of his league given the nuances and subtlety required by the screenplay.  His limited set of stock reactions- dominated by an irritating half-smile- is the primary reason CHR gets 4 stars rather than 5.

A solid supporting turn by Charlize Theron provides the primary ""growth opportunity"" for Maguire's character although the conclusion of her relationship with Homer annoys in its predictability.  Director Hallstrm creates a pastoral and non-threatening setting at the Maine orphanage, which serves only to lend credibility to the feel-good ending.

A pleasant, heartfelt experience.",1405814400,,840,5.3893129770992365

1109232,3,6305949638,"We've all heard, and maybe said, that ""the book was much better than the movie.""  Well, in this case, it wasn't.  I bought the book and waded through maybe a third of it before I quit in disgust.  I just could not relate to any of the characters in the book.  That's my opinion.  Judging from the reviews, I'm in the minority.

The movie was much better!  The characters were believable and the settings were reflective of the times.  I thought the idea of passing Homer Wells off as an MD when there was no ""paper trail"" to prove he had ever been to medical school was unrealistic.  There was plenty of bureaucracy in the 1940's.  But, after all, this is just fiction.  I was also a bit uneasy about the ""social message"" of this film.  It portrays abortion in a positive light by playing on the empathy of the audience.  Since life is not simply black and white, there are instances when abortion may be desirable or even necessary.  Abortion for the sake of saving the mother's life is one example.  However, statistics reveal that abortion is the leading cause of death in this country today.  Statistics such as that should cast it in a different light.  The tragedy is that abortion has become an issue, a ""cause clbre,"" in our society.  It is fashionable and chic to be for abortion, and the human misery it inflicts are ignored.  Those opposed to it are portrayed as ignorant savages.  One Amazon reviewer even went so far as to say that those having an opposing view of it might be ""sanctimonious insects"" and should stay away from the film.  :-D

The title ""The Cider House Rules"" is inane, although it is catchy.  When the itinerant fruit pickers found out what the rules were, they opined that they could ignore those rules since the makers of the rules did not live their lives or face their problems.  Ironically, the fruit pickers did not live the lives or face the problems of the owners of the farm, either.  And it can be argued that by accepting the work, they accepted the rules.

People forget, or ignore, that actions have consequences.  Therefore they get their fingers burned.  Others get hurt, and still others lose their lives.  It is no cliche that life is real and that you only get one chance at it.

This is a good film in spite of the controversial issues it addresses.  I have watched it several times and will no doubt watch it again.",1405468800,3,2366,4.496470588235294

Toby looks the same age as he does in Spiderman (how does he do that) and Charlize Theron is absolutely beautiful.  Round out this cast with Michael Caine and Paul Rudd and you can't go wrong.  The movie deals with the modern day issues of abortion to be sure, so if you are a hard-core Pro-Choice'er this movie is not for you.  It's not going to change your mind and will just make you uncomfortable, I think.

All in all a 5 star movie, if for no other reason than to gaze on Ms Theron and wonder ""How can any woman be so stunning""?",1403568000,2,616,4.186440677966102

1109253,2,6305949638,"Having read the book, I could only make it through about 45 minutes of this movie.  The movie significantly truncates the story, with little backstory on Homer, and inexplicably changes details such as what Wally brought to St. Clouds (chocolate? He's from an apple farming family!) and even the lack of the apple insignia on the car.  Melony is no longer ""Melony"" and there is little to no interaction between her and Homer before he leaves St. Clouds.  These are the details that made the book so rich and its development so moving.

There is also no chemistry between Charlize Theron, Paul Rudd, and Tobey Maguire.  Homer loves Candy before he even leaves St. Clouds, yet you feel nothing between Maguire and Theron.  The casting could have been better.

John Irving wrote an excellent book, but he did a disservice to it with his screenplay.",1403136000,3,845,4.786206896551724

The characters are somewhat fanciful. But I have no complaint to give regarding individual performances. Michael Caine does well (though, I'm not sure his acting in this film is Oscar-worthy). Toby Maguire is his usual awkward self. But he took his role seriously enough.

The story has some disturbing elements. The plot twist halfway through the film makes a case for a controversial practice. But I don't know how well some people will take it. Stay away from the film if you are a sanctimonious insect. Otherwise, don't sweat it.

It is a sad movie really, but beautiful and poignant because of the children.  In the context of the story, they are the ones who ""made it"", yet didn't.  They made it to life, but not in life. Rejected by what we observe as the purest, most devoted love in nature, a mother's love, and yearning for that place, they find solace in the sacrificial love of their care givers, and in each other.

It is a very well-told story about some endearing characters that reveals the dilemmas of our choices and their effect both on our lives, and an others' lives.",1397779200,,654,4.564102564102564

Supporting abortion is fairly thrust upon the viewers. Pro-life views are seen as ignorant and naive. The apparent message of this film is that ""we make our own rules"", that if one feels that a rule is unjust or unneeded, it can be discarded. Pro-Life and Pro-Choice advocates alike should be able to agree that this theme is absurd as well as dangerous. The audience is also made feel that lust equals love and to feel sympathetic towards a woman who is cheating on her boyfriend while he is away fighting overseas because she ""isn't good at being alone."" Cry me a river. As we also find out at the end of the movie, Michael Caine's character has falsified Homer's medical records in order to disqualify him for military service. How many other parents in America would have liked to give inaccurate x-rays to the Army in order to keep their sons home safe? This film is a disgrace.",1397433600,14,1054,4.494791666666667

Although the story line covered some very controversial issues, it was certainly thought provoking during and long after the movie was over.  Even though every child in the orphanage longed for a family of their own, as we watch the caring interaction between the staff and the children, we are heartened to see that these children actually were experiencing what a family is like, but they just didn't know it. I wish that were true for all children who grow up in orphanages, but of course we know that isn't true in many cases.

The movie pulled out some dramatic points from the book but changed things and also did not make the connections that needed to be made as it tried to put too much into only two hours... the book has more than 500 pages of subtle details of both Homer Well's life and Dr. Wilbur Larch.  They had Dr. Larch die at age 65 when in the book he lived into his 90s... Homer did not return until he was in his 40s in the book and he came back as Fuzzy Stone, not Homer.

In the most part, the movie stays pretty close to the book but it does leave out a huge amount of the story and even some important characters. I would guess that the cuts were motivated by time constraints (they wanted the movie to be around two hours) and because some of the content that was left out was very graphic.

In the movie it leaves out Homer's love interest at the orphanage, Melanie, and it also leaves out Homer's relationship with Candy and the baby that they have. The movie also fails to accurately show the relationship between Homer and Rose.

1109541,4,6305949638,"The 1999 film was adapted from the novel The Cider House Rules, by John Irving.  Stars of the cast include:  Paul Rudd as Lt. Wally Worthington, Charlize Theron as Candy Kendall, Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, and Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch (Academy Award Winning Roll).  While Rotten Tomatoes grants The Cider House Rules a 71%, critics gave some pretty polarized reviews expressing both praise and distaste for the film.  Confusing opinions aside, this is the movie responsible for that familiar line Goodnight, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England, spoken by Michael Caines character.  I think the movie is extremely moving and well-done; the characters become very real.  I will say that this is not a movie for children, and it can be extremely sad at some parts.

Perhaps, in part, due to John Irvings direct involvement with the film-making process (he wrote the screenplay which won him an Academy Award) and work with director Lasse Hallstrom, there are remarkably few differences between the book and screen versions of the story.  That being said, like many based-on-the-novel films, several characters personalities and/or motivations were revamped and characters featured in the book such as Angel and Melony did not make it into the movie.  These two characters had particularly large rolls in the novel, but Irving felt their involvement in the movie would create too many dynamics likely to detract from the lead story.

The Story:  Dr. Wilbur Larch, the headmaster of an orphanage, plays a very fatherly roll to young Homer Wells, a twice-returned foster child.  Homers experiences with his foster families were devastating, but Dr. Larch gives Homer a sense of belonging at the orphanage.  Larch is many things, but among them he is a closet abortionist and ether addict who takes Homer under his wing to learn obstetrics and--begrudgingly to Homer--abortions.

Wally Worthington of the Worthington family apply orchard and his girlfriend, Candy Kendall, come to Dr. Larch seeking an abortion, but leave taking Homer back to the orchard with them.  Homer begins to work as an apple harvester with a group of migrant workers led by Arthur Rose.  Because these migrant workers are seasonal, they are absent from the orchard for a time and upon their return, it is discovered that Arthur had raped his daughter Rose, and she is now pregnant.  Reluctantly, Homer agrees to help Rose by performing an abortion.  Rose eventually decides to run away, but not before stabbing Arthur; Arthur requests his death be labeled a suicide in an effort to reconcile with his daughter.

 Homer and Candy engage in a relationship while Wally is away flying in World War II.  Unknown to Homer at the time, Dr. Larch had fabricated credentials allowing Homer to practice obstetrics and also altered Homers medical records to save him from being drafted into the war.  Wally returns paralyzed, but regains his relationship with Candy.  Dr. Larch dies from a possibly accidently overdose of ether, causing Homer to return to the orphanage to take on the roll of headmaster.  Homer finally learns the nature of the gifts Dr. Larch passed to him, and steps into Larchs shoes.",1382400000,,3184,5.032442748091603

The film is an adaptation of John Irving's novel by the author himself, which makes it feel like you are very connected to the story, but I felt like it left out some fairly important aspects of the novel including some aspects that would have explained the ending more throughly. I missed having the Mary Agnes storyline from the novel as well. While I felt like the film was lacking in some of those deeper story lines, I did enjoy it. I would recommend that if you enjoyed the novel you see the film as well, and if you've already watched the film and you're looking for a wonderful novel that you read the book.

I really enjoyed both the acting and cinematography of this film. It dealt with deep issues in a believable and thoughtful manner, and it should give pause to those who see the issue of abortion as black and white.",1377043200,,1014,4.422459893048129

Homer Wells  played by Toby Maguire, Candy Kendall played by Chalize Theron where great in the Leading roles with Dr. Wilbur Larch being played magnificently by Michael Caine, who truly steals the movie and makes it what it is Absolutely Great.  I want to especially give credit to the acting of  Delroy Lindo as Arthur Rose, mainly called Mr. Rose throughout the movie.  He was absolutely magnificent, as the character Mr. Rose and the father of Rose Rose played by Erykah Badu, who plays the daughter of Mr. Rose.  The story still happens in todays world with great nurses like Nurse Angela played by Kathy Baker and Nurse Edna played by Jane Alexandr two wonderful actresses to have for these roles.

But to ask someone if they want to keep this baby and if no then just kill it, easy, done, no problem!  The girl had the abortion and at certain points I kept thinking it looked like it was going to portray how depression usually sets in as she kept looking like that at times, but no, they show her happily going on her way with no problem whatsoever with what she had done.

What's desperately needed is a producer to make a movie about the many options a woman has besides murder, options that are a lot safer and emotionally easier especially later in life.

One of the babies in his care he tries to have adopted but after a couple of failed attempts he names the boy Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) and decides to keep him at the orphanage. The boy shows an interest in Larch's work and Larch uses him as his assistant when he grows up. Larch is primarily an obstetrician, but is also willing to perform abortions of unwanted babies. Homer assists Larch in this for several years but does not approve, so he leaves and joins a group of black migrant workers working in a cider factory. When he arrives, Wells takes it upon himself to establish a set of rules of conduct for the community. One of the women on whom Dr Larch performs an abortion is the lovely Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), who has become pregnant by Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd). When Homer meets Candy again with Worthington overseas, the two develop a relationship, but when Worthington sustains a crippling injury, Candy feels she must stay with him on his return home. The black community resent having rules imposed on them by Wells, but when one of the workers, Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo), impregnates his own daughter who dies from complications of having an abortion, Rose realises the wisdom of imposing some rules for the community to live by. The acting was good in this interesting human drama about conscience and relationships, but I didn't find it an engrossing movie. For one thing it was too long.",1371686400,,1520,4.739622641509434

1109837,4,6305949638,"""The Cider House Rules"" follows Homer Wells (Toby Maguire), a young man who has grown up at St. Clouds orphanage in the Maine Countryside.  The film chronicles how Wells, a twice-adopted, twice-returned child was raised with love by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who heads the institution.  Trained by Dr. Larch as a doctor, Homer helps take care of the children as well as deliver unwanted babies.  Homer, seen as a young man with strong morals, decides that illegally aborting unwanted babies is wrong.

When a Wally (Paul Rudd), a World War II pilot, and his pregnant girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) come in search of Dr. Larch for an abortion, Homer impulsively decides to leave the orphanage and start his life anew.  Homer begins working on an orchard farm where he meets a colorful array of individuals, all with their own unique problems.  With Wally away at war, Homer begins to grow an affinity for Candy, soon blossoming into love.

The film moves at a steady pace, albeit one with some flaws, but nevertheless, it remains engaging throughout.  The underlying sub-plot revolving around abortion and the effects it has on families continues throughout the film, even if it seems a little forced.  There is one particular abortion that pulls at the heartstrings, leaving a gloomy atmosphere on the rest of the film.

The engaging acting creates characters that the audience can sympathize with as well as grow to love.  While watching this film, I was torn into many different directions, all of which revolve around brilliant acting.  Everyone, from Toby Maguire to Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy), creates memorable characters.

I highly recommend this film.

1109840,5,6305949638,"This is a very thoughtful movie, with many layers of meaning. I think I'll have to see it a couple more times to get them all.

Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) was born in a Maine orphanage of an unwed mother. His first adoptive parents soon returned him because ""he didn't make a sound."" Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), director of the orphanage, concluded that he was returned because he was ""too happy."" The second set of adoptive parents got him to cry: they beat him. After Dr. Larch rescued him from them, he decided to keep him at the orphanage and raise Homer as his own. You get an early appreciation of Dr. Larch's attitude from a couple of things; he reads a chapter of a book to the children every night at bedtime, and he turns off the light saying, ""Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.""

Homer thus grew up being Dr. Larch's assistant, which was useful in part because Dr. Larch was in the habit of putting himself to sleep by pouring ether on a filter mask. Also, Dr. Larch performed abortions when needed, which Homer would not help, as well as deliveries. Homer learned to deliver babies very well, and helped take care of the smaller children, and generally was very smart and capable. Indeed, Dr. Larch figured he was already a competent ob/gyn, even though he had little schooling. I suppose he would have been called a midwife but for the gender issue.

One day an attractive young couple came to the orphanage so that the girl, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) could have an abortion. Her lover, Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) was about to return to active duty on the ""Burma Run."" He was a pilot and this was WWII.

When they left, Homer asked them to give him a ride, not even caring where they were going. Turns out they were going to the coast, where Wally's mother, a widow, ran an apple orchard and cider house, and Candy's father was a lobster man. Homer had never seen the ocean, never seen a lobster, never done much of anything. But Wally's mother needed apple pickers, so she gave him a job. He was the only white picker, and they all lived in a bunkhouse in the cider house during harvest time.

The cider house rules were posted on a piece of paper in the bunk house, but none of the other pickers could read. When Homer started reading them out, Mr. Rose, the foreman, said they didn't need them. In fact, he doesn't finish reading them out until near the end of the film.

How Homer gets on with the apple picking and everything else, and finally returns to the orphanage as a grown man, is the basis of the story. If I haven't given too much away by saying that he eventually returns, perhaps I would if I told you the circumstances. You have to see it.

Even if the only reason was to see the adorable children who play the orphans, and have the novel experience of a story about orphans who are not exploited or mistreated, it would be worthwhile. But there's so very much more.",1336780800,,2942,4.437037037037037

1109877,5,6305949638,"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY REISSUE ***

Lasse Hallstrom's 1999 adaptation of John Irving's 1985 book (of the same name) is a rather lovely little film - that's genuinely been upgraded by BLU RAY. It's not note-perfect as a transfer by any means (soft focus here and there, a bit of grain and blocking too) - but when it's good (which is a lot of the time) - it's really gorgeous to look at.

You notice the improvements especially when the story gets to the home and lands of Olive Worthington and her son Wally (great casting in Kate Nelligan and Paul Rudd). She's an estate-owning boss and he's a dashing young Airforce Pilot who is waiting for overseas action in the Second World War. Even the indoor scenes in the live-in hut where all the apple pickers live (the 'Cider House' mentioned in the title) are very clear and at times amazingly so. The faces and clothing of the actors are razor-sharp too (superb cast choices in Delroy Lindo, Erykah Badu, Evan Park, Heavy D, and K. Todd Freeman). So too when Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire's character) is out walking with Wally's beautiful and vivacious fianc Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) while Wally's away at war - the shots by the Sea and the nearby lobster fishing port are beautiful to look at.

Acting-wise - there is so much to savour here. A huge part of the film's heart has to go to touching performances from children - Erik Per Sullivan as the bronchial Fuzzy, Kieran Culkin as the troubled Buster and Paz De La Huerta as the young teenage girl who fancies Homer way too much for her own good. Throw in Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander as elderly nurses with an abundance of unconditional paternal heart - and it feels good the second it opens. The story then moves as Homer does away from the snowbound hills and rivers of Maine to the sunny fields of working orchards in South Carolina.

But the movie belongs to its two principal leads - Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch and Tobey Maguire as the emotionally stilted orphan boy - Homer Wells (named after a cat and someone whose deep). First up is Caine who is simply sensational. Moving like a force of benevolent kindness amid the cold wooden rooms of ""St. Clouds"" (a 1930's and 1940's Orphanage he runs) - he is pragmatic and practical to the visiting pregnant women who don't need judgement (dialogue above) but an operation that is illegal. Describing himself as ""...a caretaker to many, father to none..."" - he mother hen's over a lively cast of young children abandoned in the big house with an almost casual cruelty. Each hurt child of course longs to be genuinely wanted - to be taken away by childless parents who occasionally come to visit and adopt. The scene where one pretty girl appeals to a couple - so they take her - but leave the rest behind - is heartbreaking. Caine imbibes so many of these difficult moments with a huge humanity - he's an actor capable of conveying extraordinary compassion and anger - sometimes one after the other. The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and won 2 - one for Caine as Best Supporting Actor and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay by John Irving.

Tobey Maguire excels too - his performance is full of quiet acceptance at first - but then moves into a longing for a more varied life outside of his mentor's 'doctoring' requirements. Homer's journey to his own 'purpose in the world' is long but convincing. Maguire is very, very good here. As is Charlize Theron - not just a beautiful woman - but a hugely accomplished actress. Watch out too for John Irving the Author in a tiny cameo as a Station Master at the beginning (doing his Hitchcock).

The ""Making Of"" interviews all the principal actors - as well as John Irving on adapting his own book, Stephen King (the Author) on Irving's writing and Lasse Hallstrom the Director on shooting such a huge book. Its default aspect is 1.2:35 so it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretched to full screen - it still looks great.

""The Cider House Rules"" is a warm film - and one I thoroughly enjoyed re-watching. But more importantly - if you're a fan and have love for this movie's combined cruelties and charms - then you need to see it/own it on BLU RAY.

Highly recommended.

A captivating film about a young boy growing up in a Maine orphanage.

The scenery and locations, from the Maine forests to the coastline were breathtaking. The acting and storyline held up to the location, and was one of the best movies we've seen in quite a while. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job playing the innocent and somewhat naive orphan, dealing with lifes' issues and venturing out on his own to gain valuable expieriences, only to return to the orphanage as a man to take over the day to day operations, much to the joy of the orphans he had left behind.

1109932,2,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules has nice cinematography and good acting, but it lacks a coherent plot and focus. Some things explored include the ""grey"" areas of life and how you can't always live by the rules; abortion; incest; coming of age; a romance between Charlize Theron's character and Tobey Maguire's character; the father/son-type relationship between Tobey Maguire and Michael Caine's character; and creating a family atmosphere in an orphanage. But it was unclear which of these themes was the main focus and how exactly they all connected.

Tobey Maguire's character leaves the orphanage he grew up in in rural Maine to find himself and explore the world. But he only gets as far as an apple farm in Maine, and apparently learns all he needs to know about life from some migrant apple pickers there. This just seems ridiculous to me, as his character barely gets out of his back yard when he's supposed to be striking out on his own and seeing the world.

The film really glorifies abortion as a positive thing, which is a turn-off. Michael Caine's character indicates repeatedly that he thinks the orphans he cares for and supposedly loves would have been better off aborted, which doesn't make sense to me. Charlize Theron's character is not the slightest bit shaken after undergoing her abortion, which again did not ring true. Erykah Badu's character, who was impregnated by her father, also undergoes an abortion, a relatively late-term one. We are supposed to sympathize with abortion in this case, but because it is late-term and her character is so flippant about it, I found myself disgusted.

Although the movie aims to celebrate moral relativism, I think it inadvertently shows the need to live by some rules...",1254873600,6,1725,4.961937716262976

The workers who work seasonally picking apples at an apple orchard in Maine have some rules tacked to their wall which they scorn. Eventually, the rules are thrown in the fire, and the head apple picker says, ""The rules were written by people who don't live here; we live here...."" This is a metaphor for the movie.  All the rules about morality are inherited from others who don't live here on planet Earth in the good old USA now.
Therefore, those rules don't apply. This is the kind of existentialism that traces back to Albert Camus' novel The Stranger where the characters are reacting to circumstances, even the main character who is eventually tried for murder. They are just people caught up in living their lives. Any attempt to judge them by rules or a moral standard is bogus.
The thing about this movie if you just look at it uncritically and enjoy the beautiful scenery, the beautiful looking actors and actresses, and the personalities, all of whom seem superficially likeable and attractive, you might not notice that they have broken every rule in the book, every rule of morality or Judeo-Christian morality, whatever you want to call it.

Homer was considered one of the 'unadoptables'.  The first couple who took him was disapointed because he didn't cry (orphan babies don't cry).  The second couple made Homer cry by abusing him.

Homer became Dr. Larch's apprentice, tending the sick children, delivering women of babies they're surrendering, but Homer drew the line at aborting babies. It was against the law.

Larch advises Homer when he leaves that he will find harsher conditions out in the world, but will be unable to do as much as the orphanage could.

When a young couple Wally and Candy (Rudd and Theron) come to get an abortion, Homer leaves with them.  While Wally is off to fly in World War II, Homer works in Wally's family orchard, picking apples.

There he learns about the Cider House Rules.  There's a whole wall of them posted on the migrant workers' bunkhouse.  Only thing is, Wally is the only one who can read them.  The rest of the itinerant laborers cannot read. He learns just how germane those rules are to the people who have to live out in the world.

The complex issues that Irving presents in his novel are so effectively and beautifully rendered to the screen and Rachel Portman's soundtrack undergirds all of this with the grace and panache that the material asks.

The story of Homer Wells,orphan,(Tobey Maguire) is taken right from the pages of Dickens' ""David Copperfield"". Life is full of choices.

It gave us cute orphans, and an ether-addicted benevolent doctor, and names and settings (and readings) that evoked Dickens. Perhaps those evocations made more sense in the book - they didn't seem to fit in the movie.

There were wonderful moments, to be sure. ""Goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England."" The cinematography was gorgeous, the banter between the apple pickers realistic, but the core of the matter - these themes - on the core the movie was conspicuously silent. Not silent in that it had nothing to say, but silent in that we've heard it all before. We weren't given any new ways to look at the abortion struggle, or the disgust of incest. Even on responsibility the film was, while not silent, disingenuous.

Also, nothing at all happened in the film that surprised me. I knew what was going to happen before it happened, and when events occurred that I hadn't anticipated, they were cloyingly organic and therefore neither surprising nor terribly moving.

Tobey McGuire, for all the money he's making now as Spider-Man, can't move his upper lip when he speaks, and so his delivery is always utterly devoid of emotion and his characters lack believability. Michael Caine and Kathy Bates were wonderful, both are extremely good actors. Perhaps the most believable, and sympathetic character, was Theron's - and the best acted.

1109989,4,6305949638,"`The Cider House Rules' succeeds in delivering a touching and thought provoking melodrama that's only elevated by the prime acting on the part of it's entire cast.  As Homer, Toby Maguire gives one of his better performances, although I still feel that he comes across a bit nervous and uneasy, as if he's not too confident in his own acting ability.  This though is offset by the brilliant acting on the part of his co-stars, like Michael Caine and Charlize Theron who embody their characters and come across like the seasoned veterans we know they are.

The film follows Homer, a young orphan who was raised in the Maine orphanage by Dr. Wilber Larch (Caine) who takes care of the orphans as if they were his own and has trained Homer to take his place.  The one thing Homer could never get used to were the illegal abortions, safe as they were, that Wilber insisted on performing.  It's through one of these abortions that Homer meets Candy (Theron) and Wally (Rudd).  He decides to leave the orphanage with them and take work in an apple orchard.  This of course troubles Larch for Homer is the closest thing he's ever had to a real family.

This movie touches upon so many controversial subjects, from abortion (which is controversial no matter who you talk to) as well as incest and drug abuse, but it does so with taste and tact and an intelligence that makes this film that much more impressionable.  Upon the closing credits the viewer is given a lot to ponder, a lot to digest, but that's the tell tale sign that a movie of this caliber, a movie with a message, has done its job.

One of the most intruiging aspects of this film is the absolutely gorgeous setting. The visuals in pretty much every seen were beautiful. I would recommend seeing this movie if not for the excellent acting or craftmanship but at least for the breathtaking backgrounds.

I found Michael Caine to be near perfect as Dr. Wilbur Larch, he definitely deserves his Oscar. Tobey Maguire was very good as Homer Wells and better in this role than in any other I have seen. I sometimes feel as if Paul Rudd doesn't get enough credit for his consistantly excellent acting, he was amazing and even scene stealing as Lieutenant Wally Worthington. I do enjoy watching Charlize Theron but I was only mildly disappointed in her portrayal of Candy Kendall....she is a lot better in ""Monster"". Delroy Lindo really brought to life Mr. Rose - the good and the bad of him. Eryka Bahdu really exceeded my expectations as Rose Rose and should be noted for this role. All of the supporting characters were well played and the child actors in this movie are unusually good and I enjoyed watching that little kid from Malcolm in the Middle as Fuzzy.

So all in all I'd recommend this movie to everyone to watch at some point in their lives to view something special amongst all the very poorly made Hollywood films out there.",1124755200,2,1386,4.648979591836735

1110012,4,6305949638,"""The Cider House Rules"" stars Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, an orphan who spends his young life growing up in an orphanage, while being mentored by Dr. Larch(Michael Caine) on gynocology.

St. Cloud orphanage is the setting for the beggining of the film and while here, we learn that Dr. Larch is performing more than simple baby deliveries.  He is also performing abortions, which at this point in the United States, is illegal.  Dr. Larch performs these abortions, because as he says ""If I don't do them properly or turn these women away, somone else will perform the abortion improperly"" and we are shown the horrible results of a situation where that happens.

Homer is very appreciative of everything that Dr. Larch has taught him, but feels that he must decide for himself what path his life will take.  He also has a serious issue with the idea of abortion.  So, Homer decides to leave with a young couple Candy(Charlize Therion) and Wally(Paul Rudd), whom just went through an abortion of their own.  Wally is a pilot for the air force, on a leave to help his mother with the harvesting of their apple orchards.  Homer decides that he would like to try his hand at apple-picking and gets a job at the orchards.

While here, Homer stays with the rest of the apple-pickers; a group of southern, black men, very different from anyone that Homer has ever known in his sheltered life.  He takes to all of the men and finds that he really enjoys apple-picking.  Homer also falls deeply in love with Candy, while Wally is sent back to war.

The boss of the apple-picking crew, Mr. Rose is a tough, mean boss, who prefers for his workers to ""mind their business"" and remember that their business is ""the apple business, nothing else.""  Well, the movie really gets interesting when we find out that Rose, Mr. Rose's daughter, is hiding a pregnancy.  Homer discovers this immediatly, seeing as to how he is a trained physician.  He tries to talk Rose into taking a trip to St. CLoud to have a proper abortion, but his pleas fall on deaf ears.

Then we discover that the father of Rose's baby is none other than her father, Mr. Rose.  At this point, Homer must make and face a critical decision.  He knows that if he does not perform the abortion, Rose will attempt to handle it on her own.  He also knows that their is no way that Mr. Rose will be willing to let Rose leave to go to St. Cloud.  So, Homer goes against his earlier morals and decides to perform the abortion on his own.  After he does so, Dr. Larch overdoses on ether, a drug he has somewhat of an addiction to and Homer realizes that the real world is really no different than the illegal one he knew at St. Cloud, only at St. CLoud, he was actually making the world better for many people, whereas in the real world, nobody else cared enough to let him help, when he felt he was capable of helping.

This is an extremly fascinating movie, complete with a great cast, great writing, a great score and wonderful setting. This movie tackles controversial issues such as abortion and incestial rape and shows very grapically the repercussions of both.

The title is intriguing, because when Homer reads the Cider House rules to his fellow apple-pickers(none of them can read), they all laugh, because they either break those rules all of the time or have no intention of ever doing what is forbidden in the others; except of course, sitting on the roof.  Prior to Home reading that rule about no sitting on the roof; none fo the apple-pickers had ever done so.  Well, after he read that rule to them, we see them on the roof numerous times.  As Mr. Rose states ""Those ain't our rules.  They was written by folks that don't live here.  We live here.  We make our own rules.""  And that is basically the plot of this story.  Dr. LArch had been ""making his own rules"" everytime that he decided to perform an abortion or when he forged a Harvard diploma with Homer's name on it.  He was doing things his way and, in the end, the best way for everyone.  Homer ""made his own rules"" when he decides to hep Rose and perform an abortion for her.

This movie is really excellent and thought-provoking and is really worth watching.  Very boring for children, so don't even bother showing to them.  No extreme violence or sex scenes and although numerous abortions are performed in this movie, nothing very graphic is shown---THANK GOD.

A definate movie to check out!

Great Job to the cast on this one!!",1120953600,6,4453,4.526908635794744

Final Grade: A-

Yes, this was the first time I have ever seen this movie. I am trying to watch movies that won Best Screenplay Oscars, since I've seen just about every Best Picture winner from the past 15 years. This one won Best Adapted Screenplay. It was based on a John Irving book and he wrote the script for the movie. I really want to read his books because he wrote this book as well as The Door in the Floor and Simon Birch, and the critically-acclaimed A Widow for One Year. Anyway, this was an excellent film, very powerful and dealing with some very controversial subject matter.

I am extremely pro-life, but I did agree with a couple of the lines from Michael Caine in it - that if he didn't do it properly then the pregnant mother was going to do it herself or have an amateur do it. If abortion has to be legal, I think it should be done safely, as not to accidentally end two lives instead of just one. And outside of that topic was a great story about an orphanage and how far one person will go to redeem value to their life. Great movie, I definitely recommend seeing it.",1116979200,5,1121,4.248826291079812
1110014,4,6305949638,"Homer(Tobey Maquire) was an orphan brought up in a remote orphange run by Dr. Larch (Michael Caine). The orphanage was a loving, idyllic and peaceful place, and the orphans all appeared to be happy, well looked after, and got along well with each other. Dr. Larch was a loving, caring, benevolent doctor who had the the best interests of the orphans at heart. However, Dr. Larch also performed illegal abortions, abused ether, and later on even falsified medical credentials for Homer. Homer was an innocent, naive and sensitive young man who was so generous and helpful to anyone that he met both in the orphange and later on in the world outside the orphange. However, he also had an affair with the girlfriend(Charlize Theron)of the soldier(Paul Rudd) who gave him the opportunity to see the world and then went to war, expecting Homer to take care of his girlfriend and her mother. The black foreman (Delroy Lindo) was very nice to his crew of apple pickers, but also loved his daughter ""so much"" that he was an incest perpetrator. I think the film tries to make us not to see people as either good or bad.  It delivers the message that it is not only human to make mistakes, but being human (unless your are psychopathic)will also mean that we will suffer,as a result of our guity conscience, from the consequences of making mistakes. It is a great film abut humanity and humaneness.",1116115200,,1388,4.711934156378601
1110015,4,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is a compelling film for the very reason that other posters have dismissed it.  Its characters are human in that they are fallable.  All of the characters are tainted in some way or another by their own actions.

The story follows Homer (Tobey Magiure) on his journey discovering himself outside the orphanage in which he was raised.  Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) is an ether addicted, abortion performing doctor who also runs the orphanage.  Dr. Larch has taught Homer everything he knows and would like for Homer to be his successor at the orphanage.  Homer has never attended Medical School, but Dr. Larch has and insists since he has imparted all his knowledge to Homer that Homer must too be qualified.  Homer has other ideas.

Homer leaves the orphanage with a young man and his girlfriend who have come to the orphanage to engage Dr. Larch's services.  He sees it as a chance to see the world, and he does, to a degree.  He sees two things of note: the ocean and beautiful Charlize Theron.  He begins an affair with her while her boyfriend is at war and works picking apples for cider.

The characters here are all wonderfully developed except for the orphans and all of the characters are tainted by some deed they have done.  Dr. Larch has many vices, and Delroy Lindo plays a father guilty of incest, Homer falls in love with his friend's girlfriend, and vice versa.  But these characters are never absolved for their sins.  They are never forgiven.  They either have to live knowing what they have done or die with the knowledge that they cannot change it.

There are pieces of this film that are too sweet to mix with the dark tone hovering over it.  The feel good ending nearly takes the bad taste out of your mouth, which would be tragic, because th epoint of the story is that all of us have done something to make us ashamed.  We are just normal people capable of unforgivable acts, and these mistakes will shape our lives and guide them to our deaths.  It is a bitter pill to swallow, which is probably why the filmmakers coated with sugar and gave it the feel good ending.  But all in all it is a very good film with characters rich and real enough to make us care what happens to them, even we hate them for what they have done.",1113868800,14,2266,4.478048780487805
1110016,2,6305949638,"Unlike some of the viewers here, I found the plot, characters and acting were all executed well. I haven't read the book, but it seems that Irving has cut down on the eccentricities that mar his other works (with the small exception of naming a character ""Rose Rose""). However, the themes of abortion and incest which run through the film are very harrowing and difficult to watch. I can't believe this didn't get a R rating --this is NOT a movie for young ones.

However, I found the morality of the film problematic. This goes way beyond the issue of abortion, whatever your stance on it. The message of the film seems to be that the ends always justify the means. This is totally epitomised by Michael Caine's Dr. Larch. Whether engaging in illegal abortions, forgery, falsifying records or substance abuse, it seems that this guy thinks that anything is OK as long as he gets the results that he wants. In the end, young Homer does become his successor to this kind of life. This is held up as heroic, somehow, when it is actually tragic.

This aspect of the film is the most problematic for me -- the total lack of a moral and ethical center. For this reason, I'm not sure that I would recommend the film, but it can certainly spark a lot of discussion if viewed with a lot of discernment and if you don't fall for its false heroics.",1113868800,55,1338,4.457142857142857
1110017,1,6305949638,"We can start by analyzing the main character: Homer Wells. He is an orphan that did not have anywhere to go. A nice guy finds him a job. Homer is so grateful that when his friend his at war he gets involved with his friend's girlfriend. But I guess it's OK maybe because he's an orphan. Then we have a guy who he is having sex with his daughter and gets her pregnat. I guess it's OK because he truly loves her, oh and of course his life was also hard. Then we have the doctor in the orphonage, who instead of incentivating Homer (our ""hero"") to grow as a person lied to him his whole life about his health so Homer would stay with him. I guess it's OK because the doctor devoted his life to the poor orphans so he must be good right!?
So let me translate this movie for you. This is for people who are losers, and have no sense of dignity. This is for people who don't know what loyalty and friendship is. Since they can't stop being imoral and they feel bad about themselves they watch these movies searching for some relieve. Well you might take this aspirin today but you are still a loser.

1110049,5,6305949638,"Some people may find this film too philosophical, and then it is so condensed that some say it is unfocused.

Yes, it talks about rules and laws, about morals. What is the point of laws and alternatively rules, if they are not helping those whom they are trying to help? It talks about sex impulse, about incest and abortion( in a forgiving way ), whether we should legalise abortion or whether we prefer more and more abandoned orphans grown up to be torn apart between the forces of the wish to find and show their biological parents how well they are now doing on the one hand, and ""killing them"" for abandoning them on the other, that is to say if they are lucky enough to get that far. How are they supposed to find their place in this world? Take note how Dr Larch prepared and launched Homer (and others: i.e. ""Kings of New England"") into this world.

So, once upon a time in a forlorn small place called Maine, there were some orphans who strived to survive and one of then chanced to intermingle with the folks in the fishing industry and the cider industry not too far away. A perfect fragment of this broken tiny Universe, a perfect elegy for Dr Larch.

Well, this is more like a vivid watercolour painting of this part of the Universe with characters so round and so real; not just Dr Larch or Homer, but also the Lieutenant and his girlfriend (Charlize Theron), and even the two Roses. The watercolour effects are well deployed. The sights of the operation theatre(s) full of apparatus with the pregnant women in bed would otherwise be too stupefying. Furthermore, there are so many scenes of premature deaths of the orphans and then the tragic ending of Mr Rose etc. Have they been depicted in the oil like ""My Life as a Dog,"" the impact would simply be too shocking. Moreover, the way how it is depicted now would suggest some sort of intransience, some kind of timelessness.

All in all, the film is enchanting and thought provoking all at the same time.  I will soon come back to it for a second time comparing it in detail with ""My Life as a Dog"" by the same director.",1099440000,12,2086,4.450261780104712

""A larger question remains: Why is there such a muddle about the movie's subject? I left the theater wondering what the movie thought it was about and was unable to say. It's almost deliberately unfocused; it shows us many events without guiding them to add up to anything definite.""
I got up from my bed wondering the exact same thing.  A movie should never leave you with that big of a question.  If it does, it did not accomplish anything, because it is as if it felt it had nothing to accomplish.
I was highly disappointed with this film.  It just didn't work on so many levels.  Lasse Hallstrome is probably my least favorite major director at the moment.  It seems he exists solely for Miramax to hire him so they can produce another accessible --no matter how impersonal-- piece of crap such as this in order to garner Oscars and, in the end, more money.
Many have said it is an important film because it approaches family and abortion.  But the family aspect was so sparse it felt non-existent for about 75% of the running time.  And the issue of abortion is left at an unfortunately impersonal level, exploring whether or not Tobey McGuire's character Homer finds it moral to use the medical skills his confident Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) has taught him in order to help women with abortion without bringing the issue past Homer himself.  It does not ever leave the television screen.  You aren't left thinking about whether it is right or wrong, or whether it should be legal or illegal, the woman or man's choice.  I would further my point, but I would risk spoiling the film.

Tobey McGuire is excellent as the shy, quiet, yet adorable hero named Homer Wells in this movie. He is not as gung-ho on being an abortionist as Dr. Larch (Michael Caine)seems to be in an orphanage/birth/abortion clinic.
With very little forethought or explanation Homer decides to leave the only home he has ever known and tag along with a young couple. Candy (Charlize Theron) is about to return to her normal life after having an abortion. Wally is about to leave his normal life for the War. Homer, a pediatrician in every sense but the formal training and credentials, finds paradise in the incredibly simple life of an apple-picker. As such he rubs elbows with and shares a bunkhouse with African-American, illiterate, migrant workers. He falls in a kind of naive, complacent, passive, romantic/sexual love with Candy and gives little mind to how to keep her from getting pregnant again.
The issue of incest pops up later but the details would reveal too much to the reader who hasn't yet seen the movie. The ending is not entirely predictable and very pleasant - in a tragi-comedy sort of way.
McGuire is absolutely excellent and you really can find nothing to hate about him or his character. Caine is fair in a role that I think others would have excelled at. Theron is amazingly dull and her character would only attract McGuire's character given the latter's relative inexperience with girls/women (except, ironically, in gynecological skill). Kieron Culkin's Buster character pulls at your heart strings and you really get to know Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo) and Rose Rose (Eryka Badu) even though most of the drama between the two occurs elsewhere.
  The movie has its problems. Candy is really not as sexy and loveable as she ought to be. Homer seems to be intellectually gifted yet picks apples for more than a full season without getting bored. He also fails to be assertive as the love of his life drifts away. The screenplay is quite shallow in many ways. For example, Homer is the only character developed in the orphanage scenes, despite the fact of having Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, and several, endearing, child actors as a great supporting cast. At other times the screenplay is brilliant such as all the commentary slid in about abortion as a necessary evil which is at conflict with Homer's respect for life. Yet the bias towards pro-choice and the decriminalization of abortion is obviously too slanted. Likewise the incest issue is treated almost as being a tolerable evil when Homer and everyone else should be outraged by the taboo. I am not sure I can sympathize with a man who cuts another man for throwing a cigarrette butt in the cider yet tells Homer to mind his own business as to the biological father of Rose's unborn child.
  Still despite these problems I have enjoyed wathcing the movie every time (about 5) I have watched it. But then I wonder how more conservative people view it.",1079395200,,3022,4.828185328185328

Engaging and touching throughout, it pulls you in immediately and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next.  Lasse Hallstrom's direction is just right, and the film is cast equally well.  Michael Caine does a great job (big surprise) as Dr. Wilbur Larch, the director of the Maine orphanage where a great deal of the story takes place.  He certainly deserved his Oscar for this role, and if I had seen the movie before that year's awards I certainly would have been rooting for him!
Charlize Theron is just right for the part of Candy, as is Paul Rudd as her husband Wally.  Singer Erykah Badu turns in an impressive performance as the daughter of the owner of the titular cider house.  But, in my opinion, the nicest  part of this film is Tobey Maguire, who plays the central character, Homer Wells.  The role seems to have been written for him.  Having seen him previously in ""Spider-Man,"" I wasn't really left with any particular impression of his abilities as an actor, but this movie totally sold me on him.  I'll watch anything else he's in now - who knows, I wouldn't even be surprised to find myself sitting through ""Spider-Man 2"".

1110058,4,6305949638,"Even having John Irving write the screenplay based on his own novel could not prevent this film's insufficiencies which include a lack of cohesion throughout much of the plot development. It begins quite well as the relationship between Homer Wells (Maguire) and Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine) is effectively established. There are issues between them (e.g. pro life versus pro choice) as well as mutual affection and respect. Then the film sags when Homer leaves the St. Cloud Orphanage with Candy (Theron) and Wally (Rudd). He works in the Worthington orchard and falls in love with Candy while Wally is serving in the U.S. Air Force during World War Two. And then....

I have great respect for director Lasse Hallstrom's work (My Life as a Dog, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, and most recently, The Shipping News) and do not envy him as he struggled -- with mixed results -- to bring Irving's Academy Award-winning screenplay adaptation to life. There are several magical, memorable moments such as when Dr. Larch and later Homer ""salute"" the children when wishing them goodnight; also when the children compete for the attention of visitors to the orphanage, hoping to be selected. With regard to the acting, Caine received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role and everyone else in the cast performs well. The film score is at times intrusive but the cinematography is first- rate.

However, the transitions from St. Cloud to the Worthington orchard to St. Cloud seem to me awkward. Moreover, the Rose family's problems were a distraction which reduced even more the momentum of the film's sometimes lumpy narrative. Overall, this film tries to ingratiate itself with those who see it in much the same way the orphans eagerly surround St. Cloud's visitors, clamoring for their preferential attention.

That said, I am pleased to have seen this film and look forward to seeing it again.

It's pleasantly entertaining and the acting is good, but fans of the novel will wonder why so much was omitted, and why what was included was handled so passively.",1066867200,12,768,4.8320610687022905
1110072,4,6305949638,"Cider House Rules is a fine account of the journeys of Homer, an orphan boy.  Tobey Maguire portrays the lead role very well displaying much innocence and curiosity of the wrold around him. Some may be offended by his stance on abortions, but to me I can look beyond politics. Michael Caine is fine in a supporting role as Dr. Lerch. There are certainly many elements to his multi-faceted character. Also, Delroy Lindo stands out quite notably as the lead migrant worker on the farm Homer goes to live.  its interesting how Lindo's character both loves his daughter as a father and as a lover. You want to think of Lindo as evil but there is another side to him particularly in the final scene in which he appears.
As evolving as the story is, there are many beautfiul scenery shots where the skyline is just stunning.  The architecture of the orphanage just completes the aesthetic beauty.  Overall, this earns my recommendation on all accounts.",1065830400,2,946,4.715151515151515
1110073,5,6305949638,Much of the success of this movie is due to the direction of Lasse Hallstrom and the work of John Irving in adapting his novel to the screen. The acting is superior and the emphasis is on realism. The film deals with some of society's most controversial subjects with skill. THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is an excellent movie which is deserving of its two Academy Awards and several Oscar nominations.,1059868800,3,394,4.642857142857143
1110074,4,6305949638,"THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a movie that deals with tough questions but does not provide any easy answers. It is based on a novel by John Irving and adapted for the screen by the author.
The story is mostly about life and death at an orphanage in Maine called St. Cloud's before and during World war II. In particular it is about a boy (Tobey Maguire) who is twice rejected by prospective parents and returned to the orphanage. He is then trained by the director (Michael Caine) of St. Cloud's to be his assistant as an obstetrician and gynocologist. With great sadness Maguire leaves St. Cloud's as a young man to  see the world and ends up on the Maine coast where he works on an apple farm with migrant workers.
Because of the heavy subject matter the mood is often sombre and some of the incidents involving the orphans seem especially heartbreaking. Tobey Maguire is superb in the leading role as Homer Wells. Michael Caine is excellent as Dr. Wilbur Larch. The rest of the strong supporting cast includes Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Erykah Badu and Kate Nelligan. Lasse Hallstrom is known as the director of several other fine films including CHOCOLAT and MY LIFE AS A DOG.
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor (Michael Caine) and Adapted screenplay. It also received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Director (Lasse Hallstrom), Editing, Original Score and Art Direction.",1059782400,5,1421,4.8
1110075,5,6305949638,"I suppose it is inevitable that, to fit a novel into a two-hour period, much of the detail and even significant parts of the story line must be left out. That is certain the case with The Cider House Rules. John Irving's novel had much more character development, naturally (as a book can always reveal the interior lives of characters much more fully than can any theatrical treatment), but I was a bit disappointed that significant plot developments (such as Homer's relationships away from St. Clouds) were left out. So, in this case, do read the book-you'll be glad you did.
That disclaimer having been made, I thought that the movie was very good. Michael Caine gave his usual wonderful performance, but I was never quite clear what accent he was trying to effect (being someone with a muddled accent myself, I am not really one to criticise on this point). The stories of the orphans of St. Clouds and the women who came for help in one way or another were very poignant. I was moved at the interplay between compassion and concern-the right to life/abortion debate (perhaps the central ideological pivot point in the novel and the movie) is presented in an interesting way, with just a small tendency to get preachy on one side or the other. To a large extent, this is never really resolved; while Homer in the end realises that in the adult world there are rarely black-and-white issues, but rather shades of gray, one does not know in the movie if he is really persuaded to his mentor's view.
The Cider House Rules (referring firstly to the notice tacked to the wall of one of the lodgings) serves as a metaphor for the entire film. Who made these rules? What do they really mean? What purpose do they serve? Can't we make our own rules? I found this metaphor personally meaningful, for, as a theology student, these are questions I ask and am asked on a routine basis. What authority do rules written by others have on me? on society?
This story is also one of vocation, of finding one's life's calling, a pursuit near to my heart as I prepare to enter the ministry. I find that my resistance to being pigeon-holed is similar to Homer's. He resisted the automatic assumption that he was a doctor, only to find in the course of his life that he was in fact called to be a doctor. Often when one tries to run away from a vocation, one runs into its arms in any case.
The different family situations (Rose and her father, the flyer and his, the orphanage) shows that family and community exist on many different levels. The interactions and easy acceptance of these situations is perhaps a bit of a stretch, but the interplay shows that the traditional nuclear family was more of an ideal than a realisation.
I loved the scenery, and the cinematography was very well done, but I have a slight irritation at the depiction of New England as being covered in fall-coloured foliage all year round. New Hampshire is one of my favourite holiday spots, and many is the time that I've been there that, lovely as it is, there was not a red-coloured or gold-coloured tree to be seen.
This story essentially is one about love for the unloved, the overall love for humanity, of one making one's way in a confusing world, and trying to protect the vulnerable while allowing them freedom to grow, and an infusing of a sense of worth in those whom the world would otherwise consider worthless, as exemplified in the good doctor's nightly bidding: `Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.'
P.S. Watch for John Irving's cameo in the movie, too.",1058227200,9,3554,4.5984251968503935
1110076,1,6305949638,"Tobey Maguire is good as always and Charlize Theron has a laughable excuse for a southern accent.

This movie poorly illustrates the theme that there are difficult decisions in life - that not all decisions are black-and-white:  the main character doesn't seem to face any more significant moral dilemnas besides the one in the Cider House.

He gives up hope in the world outside the orphanage he grew up in:  after losing in love and dealing with a shocking situation, he conservatively retreats to a comfortable life of familiarity.

1110077,4,6305949638,"The central character of this film at first sight appears to be Michael Caine's Dr Larch. It soon becomes apparent that the central role is of his unofficially adopted son, Homer Wells, played by Tobey Maguire. This is perhaps the only serious criticism of the film- I would have liked to have seen more of Larch, but Homer goes off and spends time with other, less interesting characters. It may be because I like Michael Caine or because his performance was strong enough to win him an Oscar, or just because the eccentric character is so different from  anything Caine has played before. This is not to diminish Maguire's performance; he comes through very strongly and is not overshadowed by the veteran actor. He plays Homer very much like John Boy Walton, an educated innocent who has outgrown his place of birth and needs to go out into the world to get some real learning. This is highlighted by the fact that he has had much experience of women's bodies in an gynaecological sense, but no intimate encounters of his own. Homer goes to work on a cider farm, and the people he meets there have a huge influence on his life. There is an amusing performance from rapper Heavy D, which nicely balances Delroy Lindo's hard man character. The music is layed on a bit too thickly at times and is in danger of swamping the production. Otherwise this is a top film.",1049673600,2,1364,4.590163934426229
1110078,5,6305949638,"Director Lasse Hallstrm joins his formidable talent with novelist/screenwriter John Irving and the results are so pleasantly literate and dramatically satisfying.  I haven't read the novel so I can't compare the two but films vs. their novels' comparisions are almost impossible anyway since each media of expression is so unlike the other.  For one, film is a collaborative medium whereas fiction writing is a solitary pursuit. Judged on its own, the film works perfectly. It revolves around a young man, Homer (Tobey Maguire), raised in an orphanage by its doctor (Michael Caine) who loves him like his own son.

Homer eventually needs to go out into the larger world and experience what it has to offer.  He has had problems with the doctor's inability to see the black and white of right and wrong. In his exposure to the outside world, by working in a Cider House in Maine, Homer too is forced to confront the gray areas inbetween right and wrong.  Delroy Lindo, as the crew boss of the Cider House, does a formidable job playing the pivotal character from whom Homer will learn the inexact rules for living his life. Caine and Irving deservedly won Oscars for their work.

1110102,4,6305949638,"Novelists are notoriously precious about adapting their work for the screen, and usually very bad at it.  John Irving is an exception and a deserving Oscar-winner for this screenplay which recognises the essential differences between a book and a film.  By pushing the history of abortion into the background, compressing the novel's timeline, and working in a little of ""David Copperfield"", Irving manages to reconfigure this story into a tale which is less about abortion and more about finding one's place in the world - and recognising, crucially, that those who want to make the world's rules first have to live in it.  The theme isn't hammered home, but is slowly allowed to declare itself through the experiences of Homer Wells, played with considerable skill and endearment by Tobey Maguire, and Dr. Wilbur Larch, in another great performance from Michael Caine.  This is what an adaptation should be: not a simple translation from page to screen, but a transposition from one register to another, making the film the occasion for a new imaginative experience without losing the qualities for which the novel is so loved.

The main plot line centers around a young man (Maguire), raised in an orphanage headed by a charismatic doctor (Caine), who decides to venture out into the world and learns the hard way that life is not merely black and white, but many subtle variations of gray.  While this is hardly a unique theme, the characters in ""Cider House Rules"" are so exquisitely drawn, and the movie so masterfully produced, that everything which might in lesser hands seem overly familiar appears fresh, new, and distinctive.

1110104,5,6305949638,"Based on the novel by John Irving, set in the 1940s, the Cider House Rules is a heartwarming story of relationships bonded by love and care.
The movie starts in a narrative style of Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) who is the caretaker of an orphanage in rural Maine. The orphanage has several kids managed lovingly by Dr. Larch along with two nurses. It is also a hospital, which takes care of delivering babies and terminating unwanted pregnancies in a discreet manner. Sometimes, prospective parents wishing to adopt a child visit the orphanage and a lucky one is taken away while the other children sadly wait their turn. One such orphan is Holmer ( Tobey Maguire) who is no longer a kid and has a special place in Dr. Larch's heart. While, the doctor shows no outward love for him, he has trained Holmer in the practice of gynecology and taken care of him in many ways known and unknown to the latter. Holmer is popular with all the kids and the one Dr. Larch has groomed to take over after him.
Then , one day a young couple arrives to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy, Wally ( Paul Rudd ) who is a pilot and his girlfriend Candy ( Charlize Theron ) have chosen this place because of it's remote location. Dr. Larch and Holmer take good care of her. Holmer is friendly with the couple and asks for a ride to town. He wants to see the world outside , he wants to do other jobs and things. His life so far has been confined to the orphanage.  He decides to leave the orphanage alongwith Wally and Candy to see the world. Dr. Larch can't accept this and is hurt, he howver, does not prevent Holmer as he knows that it was bound to happen. Everybody go out to  wish Holmer an emotional goodbye , but Dr. Larch who is unable to face the parting prefers to watch from his room. Holmer too cannot muster the courage to bid farewell to Dr. Larch.
Now, he is on his own , he sees the ocean and the country side. Wally willingly offers him a job at his apple orchard. You must be the most overqualified apple picker he says. But, Holmer  takes it and quickly learns his job. He makes friends with the other black workers in the Cider House. He learns a thing a two about rules and about the tragic lives of his black co-workers.
Inevitably, he falls in love with Candy who also fancies him especially when Wally is on war duty in Asia. The two have developed a relationship where the future is uncertain so, they prefer to wait and see. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch's health is failing and is to be replaced. What does Holmer do now? He is caught between the non-commital Candy and his moral duty of taking over the orphage and hospital after Dr. Larch.
The movie has a relaxed pace. The rural settings have a calming effect on all the characters.  Their emotions have been brought out in a quiet, dignified manner without any melodrama. You will pause to think about the life of orphans and the immense love and care their caretakers offer them. The acting is superlative. Michael Caine has won an Oscar for his role. Tobey Maguire as the young Holmer has delivered well. The movie  makes it's characters your own as they have their mind and heart in the right place.

Toby Maguire plays orphan/physician's assistant to Michael Caine's gruff but loveable doctor/abortionist.  Although essentially a subtle paen to the abortion culture, the movie is redeemed *somewhat* by its interesting characterizations, beautiful cinematography and fine acting by the principals.  The pro-abortion innuendoes are all too apparent to students of this violence.  Yet in a curious and inexplicable lapse, the producers fail to justify their ""safe abortions"" premise--virtually all of those involved in the crime meet unhappy fates!

1110108,5,6305949638,"I am not sure how I missed this fine movie; perhaps because I was not enthralled with John Irvings first novel and the film adaption that followed, and overlooked Irvings books and films since. I checked out Cider House Rules because Michael Caine was in it. Michael Caine gives a great performance and the step-back-from-the-action style of acting of Toby McGuire was appropriate for this film.
On the surface the film seems to be about abortion but in actuallity it is about choices. Michael Caine is the doctor at an orphanage and performs abortions for young ladies in distress. Toby McGuire is an orphan and the doctor's student. A student who does not agree with the teacher's choice to do these abortions. Of course, he will come to a turning point later when he must make a decision that he does not want to make. More than being a film about uncomfortable choices it is a film about human growth (Toby McGuire) and human frailties (Delroy Lindo). When a apparent decent person cannot rise above his weaknesses and be a responsible civilized being - there lies a story. Delroy Lindo plays his part so well that even when he does something so terrible you could not possibly forgive him, you still feel bad for him.
The film takes place during the early stages of the second world war when the depression years are still heavy on everyone's mind. The time period is well done in the actions and the faces of the people.

1110134,5,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is based on a novel by the fine American writer, John Irving. Over the years, it has proved difficult to translate his works into movies. The results have ranged from fair [The World According to Garp] to dismal [Hotel New Hampshire]. This time around, Mr. Irving chose to take a more active role in the process, and the results are splendid.
The first part of the movie is set in an orphanage in rural Maine in the late 1940s. Homer Wells [Tobey Macguire] is a young man who has spent his entire life there and is its oldest orphan. Fortunately for him, he has been taken under the wing of kindly, eccentric Dr. Wilber Larch [Michael Caine] who has been in charge of the place for many years. He has worked so closely with Dr. Larch that he now knows as much about medicine as almost any doctor. Still, he is in an odd situation. Not only is he not really a doctor, he's never been to high school. He is all knowledge and no credentials. As far as Dr. Larch is concerned, Homer can stay there forever and eventually wind up running the orphanage. Homer, however, yearns to see the world. One afternoon a beautiful woman named Ashley [Charlize Theron] appears with her fiance. She is there to have an abortion. Dr. Larch has performed many of these, every one of them illegal, because he has come to believe that there are simply too many unwanted children in the world. This is the one subject that Homer is in total disagreement on with his mentor. After the operation, Homer leaves the orphanage with Ashley and her boyfriend. This begins the second story line, which in the end ties in with the first one.
Michael Caine won Best Supporting Actor for his role. His is one of the most memorable characters in recent times, as well as one of the most poignant. His love of the children in his care is unconditional, while at the same time he is dismayed and saddened by a world that allows these innocents to be so callously cast aside. Tobey Macguire, as I have stated before, is one of our most gifted actors. It is always amazing to me to see such masterful and understated performances by one so young. As for the set design and photography, The Cider House Rules is about as good as it gets. Rachel Portman has contributed a brilliant and melancholy musical score.
With the current abortion controversy raging like the Hatfield and McCoy feud, it is reassuring that Miramax Films had the courage to make this movie at all. The Cider House Rules treats the subject with great dignity and proves once more that, in any area, where there is a rule, there is an exception.",1016409600,5,2596,4.502118644067797
1110135,5,6305949638,"So much, that I watched it five times.  At least the last time I caught it, I got to see the entire thing.
On the first level, you have Michael Caine's character that doesn't want any new doctors on staff at the orphanage.  Everyone on staff, including Tobey McGuire's character and the children know that Caine's character doesn't want anyone else finding out about his addiction to ether and his willingness to perform illegal abortions.  While new blood would bring some sort of financial backing for the orphanage, the head doctor had the above mentioned liberal flaws.
Tobey McGuire's character realized that he had to learn how to do something else instead of assist the head doctor, just in case his stay at the orphanage was ""abruptly ended"".  He had been adopted three times and returned three times.  Out in the real world, he discovered what his true calling was when he discovered that Rose was pregnant.  Sorry, you are going to have to watch the movie to find out who the father is.
The one thing I didn't like was that in spite of these rules that governed his job as apple-picker, his place at the orphanage, and the rules of common decency, everyone seemed to know when to break the rules, even the people over McGuire.  Rose's condition could have been avoided, if someone from the camp reported her condition, but that would mean scandal for the rest of the pickers and loss of income.  She was still young enough for foster care. MGuire knew the girl he slept with belonged to someone else. It did hurt him but he knew better that to fool around with a person who would go back to the man that got her pregnant the first time they showed up at the orphanage.",1015718400,,1678,4.5514950166112955

I really like Tobey Maguire; I think he is a very good actor and his character, Homer Wells, is a very likeable young man that we want to see succeed in life as more than an apple picker, which makes the ending very satisfying for me in some regards.  The best part of the movie is definitely the beginning, which takes place in the orphanage, but I do think that it was really important for Homer to leave the orphanage and experience more of life.  The ending of the movie is bittersweet and kind of unrealistic, but this does not detract from the overall quality of this film.  Lasse Hallstrom is a wonderful director and I am a devoted fan of his movies.  Personally, I liked the movie because it raised some issues and made some arguments that pro-lifer's needed to hear.

1110137,3,6305949638,"Yes the film has a lot to say about abortion.  But as that's clearly not all it's about, and as most of the reviews below are as full of propaganda as the movie they're complaining about, let's leave that issue and just focus on the film.
The first half is great.  The orphanage scenes are really well done, capturing the mix of companionship and loneliness that all the children feel.  Michael Caine is lovable and charismatic as Dr. Wilbur Larch, and his accent's not too bad.  Tobey Maguire is a bit monotone unfortunately, but I guess that's the character.  The kids as a whole are great.
The problems are in the second half, when Maguire's character Homer leaves the orphanage to become an apple picker and ""discover life.""  This is also when the film becomes formulaic, drawn out, and frankly boring.  Charlize Theron is completely charmless as Candy, the girl that Homer's in love with, and the whole incest angle which unfolds between the head apple-picker and his daughter (that's not giving much away, it's just annoying) is completely contrived just to tie Homer's moral dilemma up nicely, as is what happens to Candy's real fiance, who is away at war for most of the film.

Although such individuals may couch their criticism in terms of script, actors, and production values, the cause for their dislike is the film's highly existentualistic tone re personal values, its pro-choice stance re abortion, and the fairly compelling argument it makes in favor of that position. Set during World War II, CIDER HOUSE is the story of a child named Homer(Tobey Maguire) raised in a Maine orphanage by stubborn but likeable Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who trains Homer in medical arts. As Homer comes of age, however, he becomes increasingly unhappy with Dr. Larch's tight grip and extremely displeased with the fact that Dr. Larch also casually provides safe but highly illegal abortions to women who demand them. Consequently, Toby sets off to see the world--and finds himself working in an apple orchard, where he lives in ""the cider house"" with black seasonal farm workers.
There is a great deal to recommend this film. Although Tobey Maguire sometimes overplays the innocence of the character, his performance of the unworldly Homer is generally effective; the real stars of the film, however, are Michael Caine, who brings remarkable humanity to the difficult role of Dr. Larch, and Charlize Hallstrom, with whom Homer falls in love. The supporting cast--which includes Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, and Erykah Badu--is quite fine. The cinematography is remarkably beautiful, and although not necessarily memorable in terms of dialogue the script is quite effective.
Still, the film tends to rely more upon mood than upon actual substance, and as such becomes increasingly predictable as the action progresses, and most viewers will know how the story will end by the time they reach the film's midway point; it also has a very leisurely feel that some viewers will read as slow. Although it forms the crux of the conflict between Homer and Dr. Larch, the issue of abortion is never really fully explored and is presented in a rather one-sided (although very effective) manner. Those expecting an intense, fast-paced drama will be disappointed, and as previously noted pro-life viewers will despise the film from the word go; even so, and in spite of its occasional failings, most viewers will find it thought-provoking, extremely touching, and quite memorable.",1012521600,3,2416,5.310704960835509
1110169,1,6305949638,"Tobey Maguire is utterly annoying in this film, almost as annoying as he is in *Wonder Boys,* his performance is as morose and clueless here as it was there.
And to add insult to this heap o' injury, the exploration of the pros and cons of abortion in this film is nave and juvenile at best (all the depth and understanding of college freshman debating the issue); and Tobey's treatment of the pregnant woman at the end was too pat.  (Come to think of it, what wasn't too pat in this movie?)
This was a very poorly crafted story (it is, however, a film with lots of cinematic eye-candy), based on an over-rated book.

1110171,5,6305949638,"1.) It's interesting to note that some of the people who rated this film with 1-2 stars are pro-life, when this film is not entirely about abortion. The storyline presents us with romance, abortion, incest, and a boy on his journey to finding himself. It's a classic American story that touches on some issues, and yes, it does have a pro-choice theme. But, it does place a good argument on the table. Women who receive unsafe abortions will likely die, and many children are dumped into orphanages because they were not wanted. So, to those who are pro-life, I encourage you to give the film a chance. The best way to support your viewpoint is to know the argument of the opposition.
2.) So this film presents some questionable situations.....that's entertainment! Life isn't peachy, fair, or the way you want it to be...why not have films represent this??

1110172,5,6305949638,"In a recent review, Roger Ebert wrote that The Cider House Rules is ""all process and no destination"". His two-star rating credited the film with ""many charming sequences and an overall sense of intelligence"", but found that these lacked relevance within a meaningful plot line. ""What is the movie really about and where does it lead"" was his rhetorical verdict.
This criticism suggests a narrow view of what makes a movie work. It reproduces a familiar Hollywood blockbuster model where, beneath the surface, characters and plots tend to work in predictable ways. For all their obvious strengths, these blockbuster heroes are essentially passive. They move because they are pushed and pulled. Their lot is to solve or deal with things imposed upon them by history, circumstance and a preconfigured soul. Whatever motivations they have--deep reasons for behaving in one way rather than another--are not their own but received from above, and explained neither to themselves nor to the audience, presumably because no explanation is necessary.
This passiveness may go unnoticed behind bold elements in the film, and behind trappings that make the characters seem masters of themselves. A film may intoxicate with over-the-top theatrics, mind-blowing special effects, and heady drama and romance, all calculated to leave us reeling rather than critical. Characters appear determined and courageous; hard-hitting but also tender; flawed, yet graced with a redemptive justice that wins the day and our sympathy in the end. But passive characters can never be strong willed, determined, powerful or original because they lack the inner source these conditions entail. Remove the distractions and we would see only clones, characters whose so-called inner drive and originality are really just surrogates for the same, monotonous ethical standpoint, itself completely unexamined by the character or by the audience. No one wonders why so many characters from different movies all think in the same ethical terms, make the same choices, have the same sense of justice, make, recognize and fix the same ethical mistakes. Have they all been talking to each other?
In a ratings-driven commercial environment, this singular vision is also dogmatic: it does not merely represent one idea but silences alternatives. The Cider House Rules apparently got bad press from Ebert because it doesn't fit a standard mold. Its hero, Homer Wells, is more than just a billboard for stereotypes; instead, he dares to be an active agent in his own destiny. If a cloistered childhood supplied an urge to leave home, neither he nor the audience knows any more than that when it happens; you might have seen it coming but you don't know where it's going. All we know, and all he knows, is that he wants to see the ocean. Such is the lot of someone driven from within in a world too large for comprehension. Unlike the kind of character above, you feel that any future is possible for Homer, and that the things he will learn are up for grabs. You feel that his own will and openness, as much as external circumstance, lead to the events that happen: his time on the apple orchard, his love affair, and his return home.
His love affair is with a married woman, but because Homer's discovery is genuine and not dictated by an installed moral program, the usual moral taboos don't kick in the same way. He is not a sinner who must repent or else be despised, but a learner who will come to reframe past events within a developing conscience and a growing foundation of experience, whatever that turns out to be. He also learns about contradiction, a real kind that potted characters never face. When Homer discovers his boss's incest, the audience witnesses the genuine paradox of someone for whom a consistent morality isn't worked out yet. Homer genuinely abhors the incest, but cannot answer the boss when confronted with his own affair with a married woman. He can only repeat that incest is wrong.
At that point the issue of abortion returns. Homer faces a decision to recognize his training and the oath it implies, and thus comes full circle as a character who now understands a balance between the lure of new discovery and responsibility to one's own past. This new understanding leads him to return home again to fill the vacuum left by Dr. Larch. Fittingly, it is a position of greater responsibility to the orphanage than he ever had before. You know that the orphanage is again in good hands and has a bright future, precisely because Homer has made a journey to get there, a journey through experiences whose unpredictability was also their vitality.
This does not describe a movie with no destination, a journey without a purpose. It merely describes a movie with a refreshingly new, profoundly human purpose, one without many of the usual canned elements Hollywood so often depends on. In this sense I believe Ebert's review substantially missed the point. You do know what the movie was about and where it led by the time it ends. If the unpredictability of the meantime had been traded to satisfy usual expectations, it might have earned more stars but it would also have ruined the movie. As it stands, viewers can appreciate full, vital characters, top-notch acting in all key roles, and the work of a master storyteller flowing underneath. Too few Hollywood products can make that claim.",1009065600,4,5375,4.986636971046771

1110175,5,6305949638,"I just recently had the pleasure of renting THE CIDER HOUSE RULES on video yesterday. Well, I've been waiting a long time to see this film so as soon as I brought it home from the library, I put it right into the VCR. I have to say that I was not disappointed with this film at all. I have never read John Ivring's novel, but I can tell that if the film is this good, the book must be good, too.
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is about a young man, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire, in his best performance yet), who lives and works as Dr. Wilbur Larch's (Michael Caine) assistant at a hospital-like orphanage where they deliver pregnanent womens' babies. Dr. Larch thinks of Homer as his son, even though they are not biologically a family. Then, Homer feels the need to leave the only home he's ever known to find the place where he thinks he truly belongs. While he's trying to ""find himself"", he meets the beautiful Candy (Charlize Theron), and they fall in love. Of course, Candy is already in love with someone else, who is away at war and said she hates to be ""left alone"". At the end, Homer learns where he really belongs.
THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a mix of romance, comedy, tragedy, and drama. It's a beautiful and inspiring story. The entire main cast and supporting cast are absolutely superb. I can now see why the Academy chose to nominate this film for Best Picture. I'll admit though: I first wanted to see this film because Tobey Maguire and Kieran Culkin were in it and they are two of my favorite actors, but it's a beautiful story even without them. I recommend this film for anyone who's ever needed inspiration in their lives.",997920000,3,1631,4.403973509933775
1110176,5,6305949638,"This film has affected me in ways I can't explain.  It was beautiful and harrowing.  It was heartwarming, painful, gentle, brutal, tragic, uplifting.  Homer Wells is the touchstone for all of those feelings, and I just wish I could put it better than that.

""An innocent abroad"" is not all there is to it....Homer is a blank slate in all respects but one.  At approximately 20, he's almost a child himself, except that he knows everything there is to know about birth, and more than we ordinarily know about its alternative.  His mentor and loving father figure, Dr. Larch, has brought the boy up as a medical prodigy.

This is the eager soul who sets out on the road one day from his lifelong shelter at St. Cloud's orphanage, at the sudden impulse driven by love at first sight.  His heart's hope, Candy Kendall, is in a committed relationship to a young man (Wally Worthington) who quickly becomes Homer's best friend.  Homer is an earnest, needy young man with good core values and a helpful disposition.  This combination is a recipe for a complicated life.

Situational ethics are at the core of this film.  Homer has to confront his heart in every circumstance, even the literal sense...he is given by Dr. Larch to believe his heart itself is physically vulnerable.  It surely is given spiritual tests of every kind.  Dr. Larch, with completely moral intentions, is in the abortion business (the reason for Candy and Wally's visit to St. Cloud's) as much as in the adoption business.  His fatherly love for Homer allows him to lie to the boy about Homer's own health with a clear conscience.  His belief in giving choices to desperate women allows him to commit felonies (at the time) also with a clear conscience.  Homer understands abortion as a practical need but, as an orphan, develops a personal philosophy against it.  Homer accepts Dr. Larch's practices but won't practice abortion himself.  Homer takes all of this and more with him into the world.

It's the story of how people deal with the conflicting values that they believe in.  Candy loves Wally, and she needs Homer.  Homer is an orphan who cherishes life but must confront abortion as a realistic option.  Dr. Larch is a father figure without children of his own, and his need for Homer to succeed him is the need not only of an orphanage director for a sympathetic colleague, but also the need of a doting parent.  There is a lot going on here and it doesn't allow for simple resolution.

1110210,3,6305949638,"Some movies deliberately keep you off-balance, never quite revealing--until the very end--what they're really about.  ""The Cider House Rules"" tops that challenge; it's one of those rare miscalculations that never reveals what it's about at all.  It lurches from subplot to subplot, theme to theme, with all the clumsiness of a vagabond who's had one trip too many to the cider barrel--and yet Lass Hallstrom's touch is so gentle, his direction so graceful, that it's ultimately impossible not to be as moved as you are confused.
A chilly Maine orphanage, run by the aging, ether-addicted Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), serves as the film's initial setting.  Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) is a precocious but withdrawn young orphan who demonstrates great potential to be a doctor.  When a young couple, Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) arrive at the orphanage to have their child aborted by Dr. Larch, Homer leaves his home to follow them.  He eventually becomes a hired hand at Worthington's apple plantation--and from there, well, suffice it to say that the plot doesn't just thicken, it curdles.
""The Cider House Rules"" was adapted by John Irving from his own novel, and it's plain to see that the serious issues he tackles were probably given far richer treatment on the page.  In a two-hour film, they're forced to compete for your attention.  It's not really about orphans (although there are enough cutesy shots of their pinched little faces to make you think so at first), although again, what it really IS about is indeed a profound question.  Illicit love, abortion, incest, murder--these are not subjects to give short shrift to, and ""The Cider House Rules,"" frustrated by its own schizophrenic tendencies, never really does full justice to any of them.  Even the inevitable explanation of its title is such a hokey, contrived bit of symbolism that it feels like yet another unnecessary appendage.
What keeps this film afloat, and makes it far more rewarding than it deserves to be, is the superb cast.  Caine won an Oscar for his portrayal of the occasionally cantankerous but genuinely sympathetic doctor, and he shares a remarkable father-son chemistry with Maguire.  Also good are Rudd, Theron, and Delroy Lindo as one of the hired hands, although his character is never satisfyingly explored.  This being a Hallstrom film, the feel-good sentiment is in full force (although never as cloyingly as in the loathsome ""Chocolat""), but this is one time I didn't mind.  The music soars, the settings are enough to make you want to go out and be an apple-picker, and dash it all, those orphans ARE pretty darn cute.

1110215,4,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules
Score: 78/100
After winning two Academy Awards and been nominated for 5 more, The Cider House Rules became one of my many must-see's, and while I personally think it didn't deserve such Academy praise, The Cider House Rules is pretty much a great film, and while I can think of a lot better movies that came out in it's year, this is nonetheless a watchable and nicely played-out little flick from Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom.
Homer (Tobey Maguire) is an orphan in remote St. Cloud, Maine. Never adopted, he becomes the favourite of orphanage director Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who imparts his full medical knowledge on Homer, who becomes a skilled, albeit unlicensed, physician. But Homer yearns for a self-chosen life outside the orphanage. When Wally (Paul Rudd) and pregnant Candy (Charlize Theron) visit the orphanage Dr. Larch provides medically safe, albeit illegal, abortions Homer leaves with them to work on Wally's family apple farm. Wally goes off to war, leaving Homer and Candy alone together. What will Homer learn about life and love in the cider house? What of the destiny that Dr. Larch has planned for him?
I found The Cider House Rules to be marvellous the first time round, I would of given it perhaps a 92/100 rather than the 78/100 score I have just recently lowered it to. I found a lot of flaws in the film, it's sometimes boring and a little corny at times, but it remains a dramatically moving piece of work with excellent direction from the Oscar-nominated Hallstrom. Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron are superbly cast as the two movie-lover's dripping closer and closer, while Michael Caine, if not quite as good as fellow Oscar nominee's, still put in a hearty and believable performance as the caring Dr. Larch. Another big bonus is the piano score, which is brilliantly played by Rachel Portman and friends, and is an exceptional score, which suits the movie perfectly.
Highly recommended and nicely setout, The Cider House Rules is a critically acclaimed piece of work that truly deserves its praise.",985392000,,2062,4.92816091954023

Now having watched it, I remain very happy with the movie.  The script is an excellent, if abridged, version of the novel and the cast perform wonderfully under Hallstrom's direction.
The story is a reasonably slow-moving, character-driven one.  The focus of the story is on children and growing up, the support they receive and the perils they face.  The lead character, Homer Wells is brilliantly portrayed by Tobey Maguire, who didn't necessarily look like I imagined Homer would but his acting brought the character to life for me.

1110252,5,6305949638,"The title, ""The Cider House Rules,"" refers to a list of ""Don'ts"" posted in the bunk house where migrant apple pickers stay on a New England farm near the sea, in the early 1940's.  The illiterate workers have stayed there for years not knowing what the rules are.  When the list is finally read to them, it turns out they've been breaking them for years.  They are small rules, like don't eat lunch on the roof.  They have no meaning.  Meanwhile, a very serious, unwritten rule with consequences has quietly been broken.  This becomes the metaphor for the primary story of an orphan who grows up apprenticed to the doctor who takes in homeless children or performs abortions, depending upon what is asked or needed.  For the orphan, the latter is not an option because it cancels out the meaning of his own life.  When he takes off to explore the world, without ever leaving Maine, he discovers that making meaning is a very difficult, chaotic process.
For a film that celebrates simplicity, The Cider House Rules is difficult to sum up in a small space.  In episodes that are deft (""stark"" others have said), even fleeting, there can be a thicket of symbolism and feeling that defy easy description.  A strong hand keeps this on the humane side, rather than the sentimental.  It is not oppressive, though.  The acting is wonderful; Michael Caine is splendid as a man who makes it his business to try to elevate the saddest problems in life to the most meaningful.  Each night, he says a sincere good night to the cast-off children, imparting a rhythm of safety and grandeur to their lives, though he is well aware of the fragility of life.

And so it was with a young man who grew up an orphan in the State of Maine, in the years preceding World War II, in ""The Cider House Rules,"" directed by Lasse Hallstrom.  Under the tutelage and watchful eye of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the administrator of the orphanage in which Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) had lived his whole life, Homer, by 1943, had become quite knowledgeable and adept in the field of medicine.  What he lacked, however, was the formal education that would have enabled him to practice what he had learned, if indeed, he had so desired; which in fact he had not.  The orphanage was a world unto itself, a loving haven for unwanted children, but a place apart; and a larger world loomed just beyond it's perimeter, a world Homer Wells wanted to see.  And when circumstances present Homer with an opportunity to get away, he grabs it, and embarks upon his journey of discovery, much to the consternation of the good Dr. Larch, who fears that he has lost Homer-- whom he loves as a son-- to the world forever.  And forever is a long, long time.  Hallstrom presents the story with acuity and care, drawing upon the innate humanity of the characters--especially Dr. Larch and Homer-- to bring it all to life.  While Dr. Larch epitomizes the benevolent nature of man, one who has known the world and has come into his own, has found the place from which he can do some good, Homer represents the longings of youth; no longer a boy, but a man who must discover on his own what Dr. Larch already knows.  And, as it is in real life, it becomes a matter of experience; and though fate ultimately intervenes with a nudge in the right direction, it is Homer who decides the direction his own life will take-- it is he who finally realizes what is meant to be.  And under Hallstrom's steady and skillful hand, the journey becomes, not only Homer's, but the viewer's as well, as he mines the emotional depths of the characters, making them people with whom the audience will be readily able to identify.  Affecting an American accent for the first time in his career, Michael Caine gives a performance that deservedly earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  He brings Dr. Larch so vividly to life, capturing the deep concern and humanity of the man, while conveying his sincerity and exposing his vulnerability; it's a complete and real portrayal, enriched with nuance and altogether memorable.  As good as Caine is, however, the film clearly belongs to Maguire, who gives a masterfully understated performance as Homer.  There is such expression in the pacific nature he lends to the character, along with a sense of mature acceptance that serve to accentuate his inner yearnings, that make Homer so believable, a person with whom it is easy to sympathize and relate.  There is something of a wistful poet beneath his stoic, though gentle, outward appearance that makes him endearing.  With a subtle ability, Maguire makes it clear that Homer is a person of intrinsic good, and it gives not only the character, but the performance, a ring of truth and integrity.  It's exceptional work, and taken in conjunction with his turns in ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Wonder Boys,"" firmly establishes Maguire as one of the best young actors in the business today.  The extraordinary supporting cast includes Delroy Lindo (Mr. Rose), Charlize Theron (Candy), Paul Rudd (Wally), Jane Alexander (Nurse Edna), Kathy Baker (Nurse Angela), Kieran Culkin (Buster), Kate Nelligan (Olive Worthington), K. Todd Freeman (Muddy), Erykah Badu (Rose Rose) and Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy).  Highlighted by outstanding performances and the sensitive interpretation and delivery of the story by Hallstrom, ""The Cider House Rules"" is a touching excursion into the depths of human emotions, and a taste of what life is all about.  More than just a film, it's an experience; one that will create a lasting impression on your soul, and one that absolutely must not be missed.",982627200,7,4151,4.827926657263752
1110255,4,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is a movie that is both entertaining on the surface and filled with symbolism on a deeper level.  This movie will please teenagers out for a good time and movie critics looking to analyze a movie rich in meaning.
To describe breifly the plot, a young man, Homer (an orphan from birth), ventures outside of his accustomed surroundings, as all young people eventually do.  He finds himself living on an apple orchard plantation, earning his living as a field picker.  During his time there, he falls in love with a woman who is already spoken for while he's living with the other hired hands in the ""Cider House"".  The movie's namesake comes from a list of rules posted in the hand's quarters.  Posted by the orchard's owner, the rules hardly relate to the servants or their behavior. By showing how ""lower"" people are effected by the regulations of ""higher"" people, the rules encumber the movies entire theme.
Homer is a unique inspiration to the other workers and is well respected in the orchard.  Homer defies the theme because he is a white man thrown in with a group of black plantation workers, yet he aspires to learn and grow from them, reversing the idea converyed by the rules.
Homer's character shines hope on the human race and brightens the movie through his inspiration.  The Cider House Rules is a breath of fresh air and leaves the viewer feeling refreshed.  Homer's good will makes the movie and success - hands down.",981676800,5,1455,4.700787401574803

Much of it is lost in Irvings adaptation of his own brilliant work...so much of the humor, depth and prose ...as well as characters, are lost(Farewell Melony)...but this is a very sweet film.  Shot in the sweet nostalgic glow of a classic, Rules is a joy to look at.  It deals with touchy subjects...but not in an absurdly preachy way.  As you read these reviews, you will see people bringing up the abortion issue...but it is a film about life and the choices that one has to make while living.  This is pro abortion...as well as it is pro family.  It manages to create an idelible image of orphanages, and of the pain and joy found in such institutions.  You won't forget Fuzzy Stone...you won't forget the faces of all the kids in St. Cloud's, and the work is fabulous.  Like all of Irving, we are dealing with humans with foibles , pains, triumphs and failures.  These characters are brought to light by the actors....Michael Caine is great, as is the solid nursing staff of Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander.

1110257,1,6305949638,"Although this movie was very well directed and had great performances by Michael Caine, Tobey Maguire, and Delroy Lindo, I was thoroughly disgusted with the overwhelming pro-abortion theme.  I watch movies to be entertained.  I don't want to be preached to.  This story was way off the mark.
I felt very ill after watching it because of the complete disregard for human life.  The most obvious scenes were the disposals of the fetuses (and older?) into the fire in the back yard.  The way it was filmed made it obvious that there should be no consideration whatsoever for the lives of babies, that they are to be thrown away at the whim of whatever parent just happens to be ""inconvenienced"" by their births.
I am a fan of Tobey Maguire and very much enjoyed his performance in ""Ride with the Devil"" a lot more than this garbage.",979257600,31,829,4.612244897959184
1110258,2,6305949638,"A lot of people aren't going to like what I have to say about ""The Cider House Rules,"" but as a critic with my own movie review show, my personal opinion is that this film was a joke. Not a ""funny, ha ha"" joke, but a ""predictable, blah blah blah"" joke.
First, I have to say that the nomination for ""Picture Of The Year"" that ""The Cider House Rules"" received was stolen from much better films from 1999, such as ""Magnolia"" and ""Being John Malkovich."" Second, ""The Cider House Rules"" was just another example of the tired formula of Hollywood sneaking in the Independent Film formula of coming of age and passing it off in a different setting, hoping the audience doesn't catch on. And for the most part, it seems to have worked, achieving Oscar recognition. Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor, so it's sad to see him waste his time on such a predictable script. Especially the last half hour of the movie, which seems to get more jumbled as the movie reaches its end. It's like the author, who was writing the script based on his own book, realized that he only had 30 minutes left to work with, so he had to squeeze 200 pages into that time. The result is a film that feels the audience is far too dumb to understand the messages it's trying to get across, so it bludgeons the viewer into unconsciousness with its message. It's like the film keeps poking you with a stick while asking, ""Do you get it yet? Huh? Huh? Do you get it? Bet you didn't see that one coming!"" But you know what, you do see it coming.
All in all, I'm not trying to tell you what to think on the subject of the film. I'm just saying that the film does a poor job of explaining the material. It's like the film is making up excuses for everything, except for coming up for an excuse for its own failure as a movie.",978998400,7,1787,4.274336283185841
1110259,5,6305949638,"Although there are many differences between the story line of Irving's novel and the screenplay written by John Irving himself, the changes and rule bending in this adaptation are responsible for the most beautiful, pure hearted and touching story I have ever faced. A rich, although already very explored, terrain for heart-breaking and tear-rolling emotions is the set for this amazing fable. St. Cloud's is an orphanage located in Maine, where the main character of the story was brought up. With brilliant acting by Tobey Maguire and Michael Cane, this movie touched me in a way I never thought anyone could. I never thought of this story as a vehicle to commment on controversial topics, such as abortion and incest. I've always looked at it as a story of how far you have to go, what a battle you have to go through to finally be able to listen to your heart. In addition to the beautiful story line, the script, Lasse's direction, the original score(by Rachel Portman) and the photography of this movie help me classify it as a ""master piece"", it changed my life in a way I'll never be able to explain.",978825600,5,1109,4.6923076923076925
1110260,4,6305949638,"""The Cider House Rules"" was a pleasant surprise. Instead of trying to be cutting edge or over the top, ""The Cider House Rules"" succeeds in making a beautiful film and that alone. This film has a good story (the movie was adapted from John Irving's novel), modestly good acting, and a good score.
""The Cider House Rules"" is a simple story with well-recognized themes. An orphan boy named Homer(played by Toby Maguire) helps a doctor(played by Michael Caine) to take care of orphan children and perform abortions. However-like all teenagers in movies and books-Homer has a desire to see life and decides to go away with a couple who have just visited to do just that, see life. Michael Caine's character insists that Homer stay but of course doesn't listen. Toby and Michael have an excellent chemistry on film. On his travels with the couple, Homer falls in love and discovers a mystery hidden by a group of African-American slaves on an orchard.
The film is like learning French or listening to Handel; just beautiful all around. The Cinematography is brilliant and makes me want to go to Maine. The acting is well reserved and doesn't become mellow-dramatic or fake. The score(I bought it on CD after I saw the film) is also another great aspect of the film. From the dramatic theme to the simple piano numbers, the score adds to the greatness of the film.
I recommend this film to everyone and know you'll enjoy it. It won't be on your favorite film list or your favorite of '99 but will keep you inspired for awhile.",977961600,7,1519,4.6716417910447765

'RULES ARE CONDITIONAL!'  to say that this movie promotes abortion and is offensive to people who are against it, one suggests that 'the sixth sense' is offensive to people who don't believe in ghosts and 'star wars' is offensive to people who dislike science fiction.  please.  abortion is only used in this story as an example of one moral that can be thrown away in extreme circumstances.  the movie shows to the people who watch it (as opposed to those who compare it to their own moral code) that rules can be broken, and if they are all applied (like the 'cider house rules') they can become rather ridiculous.  it merely encourages people to look outside of the strict moral code that we imprision ourselves in, and discover all that we may have missed.  i find the opinion, that the entire focus of this movie is on abortion, an insult to other movie-goers who may have been more than astounded by the way the MAIN theme of the cider house rules is presented.",977875200,4,1540,4.51985559566787
1110302,2,6305949638,"The easy answer is that ""The Cider House Rules"" is about abortion.  Though life is pretty in the WWII New England mileau in which this flick is set, there are still unwanted children (many of whom are sickly) and no shortage of people who would save everybody the trouble of even having children to leave for adoption by getting a (then illegal) abortion.  Homer (Tobey McGuire) is an orphan raised by the saintly Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), and slowly trained to experienced perfection in every aspect of gynecological procedure.  Larch's proto-choice views are tempered (for those with pro-life/anti-choice types) by a seeming boundless compassion for the children housed in his orphanage, and also by the quiet dignity of his debates on the subject with Homer.  Homer staunchly opposes the idea, but the basis for his objection is not as clear (is it blind devotion to anti-abortion laws?  Is he stuck on the idea of life from conception?)  While the two charachters repeatedly discuss the right and wrong of abortion, and Homer reaches an apotheosis by the end of the story when (as if we couldn't see this coming a mile away) circumstances lead him to perform an abortion of his own, the director keeps the subject from becoming the story's focus.  When a young couple (Charlize Theron and Paul Rudd) invite Homer to come away with them, Homer, who has never gone far from the orphanage and hasn't even see the ocean once, jumps at the chance.  Leaving the hopelessness of Larch's orphanage (and the possibility he may have to perform the procedure that dare not mention its name), Homer joins a community of migrant laborers working for Theron's family.  Becoming an Apple-picker, Homer sees a world more rustic than he had ever known.  There is a sort of honesty to the hardy life of migrant labor, one that initially entrances Homer with its sincerity.  (The title takes its name from the sets of rules posted by Theron's mother in the living quarters for the workers.  Hoemr decides to return the favor by posting some rules of his own.)  The world of cider-making seems no-less mythic and insulated from the rest of the world than the orphanage, but Homer soon learns otheriwse.  An illicit affair with Charlize Theron and the specter of incest weaken Homer's once rock-solid resolve to his morals.
But it's all so forced.  Mcquire's passion for Theron seems so perfunctory - it comes out of nowehere.  And the supporting charachters- migrant-workers who spearhead the sea-change in Homer's anti-abortion views seem to exist only for that purpose: whether abortion or simply not smoking in the cider-house, Homer's instinct is to follow the rules.  But the workers and Theron's charachter seem to exist only to break Homer down.  It's impossible to say how hard the effort is because Homer seems to collapse whenever the chance arises.  The passage of time (which seems as ephemeral as in ""Aspen Extreme"") doesn't help - just how long has Homer held out before giving in?  Instead of confronting the abortion issue, the script is happy enough to turn Homer around until he is ready to assume the mantle of Larch himself. Whether you agree with choice/abortion or not, there is no underscoring the trauma that turns Homer around.  Thus ""Cider House Rules"" disengenuously takes the tragedy of moral compromise and serves it up as a triumph.",977788800,4,3347,4.909413854351687

1110307,3,6305949638,"John Irving used to write great books - not many works that belong to a ""Modern Fiction"" shelf sell in millions. But the novels' inhabitants - the endearing misfits having their clashes with reality -  had a very bad time translating into movie characters. Robin Williams as Garp is just a huge tasteless joke.
The author's later offerings are less memorable and way too long. They feel stillborn, lifeless, though there are still some glimpses of John Irving we love. I've stopped reading his books with The Son Of The Circus. When a new novel comes out I leaf through it for an hour and put back on the shelf - I'd like to remember the writer in his prime.
I had a definite impression that John Irving drifts into obscurity, into the void of artsy vagueness. And all of a sudden I see him clutching the golden guy with a sword, riding the Oscar hypewave.
The author made a script out of his last great novel, leaving all the originality behind. What we have now is the simplistic Coming Of Age/Period Piece Hollywood movie that tackle for a couple minutes some serious issues. Michael Cain is good, he delivers ""the performance you can always rely on"". He is evidently out of his league in this cast. Toby McGuire is a nice young actor, but he seem to have just one facial expression available and the more times he puts it on the less endearing it looks. Evidently, Charlize Theron has not arrived to the stage, where she is no longer required to sell a film with her body - which is perfectly OK with me, but that the-beauty-spreads-across-the-sheets scene looks like a bonus.

Beautiful cinematography, amazing score, perfectly cast, great locations, and a simple, yet sometimes complex story to base it upon.
Every shot of the film is breathtakingly beautiful. The camera slides with simplicity and perfection, and the picture is colorful and crystal clear.
The story is nicely put, and the film's two hours reel by silently and quickly. Tobey Maguire, who was in one of the most amazingly moving movie experiences, The Ice Storm, is back again(after other great films like The Wonder Boys and Pleasantville).
He is Homer Wells, son of parents who have no need to take care of him whatsoever, and lend him to a orphanage where Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) takes over. Dr. Larch must be pretty special -- he has had several Wilburs' running about in his orphanage(named by him, of course).
Young Homer Wells grows up in the orphanage, and learns a great deal of hospital education through the usual pregencies and illegal abortions preformed at the orphanage.
Having spent his entire childhood and up to his teenage years in a baby-giving orphanage, he decides to see some of the world. He must of been really lucky, because of all that he sees is completely beautiful and wonderous. He then goes into an apple farm and meets some nice people there too.

You'll be amazingly disappointed at what was important and beautiful in the novel has become cheap and Hollywood-ized in the film (especially the ending).

On its own, the Cider House Rules film is a nice work of motion picture, with well-written dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and good performances.  But to see what Irving did to his novel (in what I'm assuming is the interest of time and to give the film a more traditional happy ending) is to see utter disappointment in this film.

1110347,2,6305949638,"I liked ""Cider House"" OK when I first saw it, but it certainly wasn't the instant classic the movie ads were screeching about.  It also didn't age well with me.  Within minutes of leaving the theatre, I was bothered by awkward moments that didn't fit, or by the over-cuteness of those gosh-darn-adorable little orphans.  Problem is, the movie's not about those adorable orphans, or the equally adorable and interesting Doctor played by Michael Caine, but about a far less interesting story and place, complete with a glamour shot of Charlize Theron's all-over tanned backside.
This was just not a great movie.  It's a completely adequate one, and an enjoyable couple of hours.  But there's nothing all that deep or interesting about it, save for a quietly wonderful performance by Caine that I actually think seems better than it is, simply because the rest of the movie is so curiously bland.
Sure it offers cute orphans, sexy Charlize Theron, and some sticky ethical issues deep in all the candy coating. But for the first time director Lasse Hallstrom fell flat for me.  The movie looks like a gooey Hallmark car with a not-so-sweet center.
And while Tobey Maguire is simply terrific with a part that would have seemed bland in any other hands, the fact is that he's hopelessly mismatched with Theron, who looks at least ten years older -- and hopelessly glamorous -- when set next to this sweet cracker kid.  Theron is beautiful but she is utterly unconvincing as a ""simple lobsterman's daughter"" and seems to belong in a completely different movie.  Even her wardrobe is the kind of overglamorous stuff Marilyn Monroe would have loved.  (How many lobsters does Dad catch, anyway?)
I love John Irving's books, and loved the novel this is based on, but I think this whole ""Summer of 42"" angle for the film hurt it.  And because I couldn't seriously see this gorgeous movie-idol woman choosing too-young-to-shave Maguire (and the romance itself is clunky and sparkless in its depiction), the whole movie didn't stand up well, and went downhill fast after.
I was also really unhappy that a film this mediocre would be chosen as a nominee for Best Picture (but again, Miramax knows how to spend those ""for your consideration"" ad dollars).  When measured against wonderful films of last year which should have been nominated for the Best Picture spot instead, such as ""Magnolia,"" or ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" or even ""Being John Malkovich"" -- ""Cider House"" is already being recognized as overpraised and hopelessly outclassed.  (I actually couldn't help but wonder if some of these other ecstatic customer reviews actually came from the PR machine at Miramax.)
Unless you loved the book, don't spend the bucks, but wait to catch it for free on cable.  You'll probably be more forgiving.",970012800,7,2786,4.927350427350428
1110348,5,6305949638,"In the time it took me to pick up a DVD of ""Cider House Rules"" off of the shelf and walk down the aisle to the cash register four different people noticed it in my hands and stopped to tell me how great of a movie it was.  It eased my mind about my indecision to purchase it and I proudly whipped out my check book!  All four people were of different ages from 17 to 60. I think that amazed me the most.
The main issue encompassing the movie is ""abortion"".  Both sides of the issue are shown; and, no matter where you stood originally it made you realize that maybe there isn't a right or wrong in all situations.  The abortion issue is there...but, it is not jammed down your throat.  Actually, it is a movie where all of the characters have their own story.  All of the storys gently fit together to make one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
All of the characters in this movie are strong and unforgettable!  I can see why Michael Cain (who plays the doctor of an orphanage) won an oscar.  However, it was Tobey Maquire (who plays young, coming of age ""Homer"") who deserved an Oscar for his performance.  I'm not sured how his performance was overlooked because his performance shined like a big, bright star!
I won't go into a long synopsis of the movie since you can read it in the Amazon.com synopsis above.  However, I will say that this is definately a movie worth seeing more than once!",969753600,,1406,4.271698113207547

I know that this movie is also  about growing up and realizing that living by the rules is not always what  is right.

1110393,5,6305949638,"There is a lot of debate as to the content of this film and what people  say it advocates or makes light of. For instance, the ongoing battle  between pro and anti-abortionists. Not every woman in this film has an  abortion. Think about the involving circumstances and how tough that choice  is to make. Sometimes there is no other choice. If there isn't an abortion,  then it is another child waiting to be adopted. It is a sad situation with  no way out. There is no benefit to either and this movie only depicts a  good Samaritan at work who listens to these desperate women and gives them  the choice to give the baby away or to take it away. Then there are the  circumstances involving the time period. It was the 1940's, World War II  era. To become pregnant out of wedlock and at such a young age (and most of  these women could not even be called women yet) meant being disowned and  abandoned, left out in the cold. This is something that a girl did not want  to face; being ostracized by both family and friends. So they went to a  back alley doctor and had the dirty deed done but only to the destruction  of their health. This is the point that Dr. Larch makes in the movie when  Homer begins to reveal his issues with abortion. ""When they don't come  to someone who can do it correctly and safely, this is what happens!""  he tells him. I will admit that this is a very delicated issue but Michael  Caine's character is the ear that is not often lent to all these women, a  man for all the men in the world who will listen, understand, sympathize  and give them a choice. This is what this film demonstrates, no more and no  less.
Now that I am past this argument, I wish to express the reasons for  my deeply felt connection to this movie and the performances reaped from  its distinguished and versatile cast. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Homer  Wells, the calm and self-assured protege of Dr. Larch (Caine) who is  edified on morality at an early age at St. Cloud's Orphanage and Shelter.  The father-son relationship between Homer and Dr. Larch is strongly  detected, and like any parent, he pushed Homer to excel in his medical  practice, endeavoring by illegal means to validate him as a professional  surgeon and general practitioner. Unfazed by Dr. Larch's tenacity, Homer  immediately begins to walk his own path when he spots a blonde beauty named  Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), the girlfriend of a WWII lieutenant named  Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) who requests an abortion at St. Cloud's. Upon  Candy's and Wally's departure, Homer jumps ship and heads out to unfamiliar  territory, attaining employment at Wally's family orchard. From there he  learns the delicate art of the cider-making business, the art of social  endurance, and the whirlwind of emotion that encompasses true love.
Since  her radical stints in movies such as ""Two Days In The Valley"",  ""The Astronaut's Wife"" and ""The Devil's Advocate"",  Charlize Theron has become a recognizable talent in the film industry and  is deserving of her critical praise in this literary adaptation of John  Irving's timeless novel. She is somewhat dizzy in personality at first  impression, but as time goes on, she shows that she is a very sympathetic  and heartwarming character despite her obvious flaws (adulterous). Michael  Caine as the indomitable Dr. Wilbur Larch is once again in top form, a  polished player with an untouchable and keen ability to texture every facet  of his character. I was first introduced to his stellar charm and  surprising comedic abilities as Lawrence Jamieson, the suave con in 1988's  ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"". As for Tobey Maguire, I can only say  that he is a work in progress, one that will dominate the field in a matter  of years. With his cutesy candor in 1998's warm and fuzzy comedy  ""Pleasantville"" and aside Michael Douglas in 99's ""Wonder  Boys"", he is climbing the ladder of recognition at a solid and steady  pace.
Little did I know after I watched the film and happened to glance  at the credits, I was surprised to learn that two of the smaller roles were  dominated by musicians, one of forgotten past and one of proverbial  present. Erykah Badu, an R&B crooner with one Grammy to her name so  far, proved to be an impressive actress with little or no training as Rose  Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose. In a profoundly smaller role but with a few  lines to suffice, Heavy D (a hip-hop presence of the 80's) displays a  minute amount of charm as Peaches, a fellow co-worker on the farm. Who I  was stirred by the most in the supporting roles department, however, was  Delroy Lindo as the loathsome Mr. Rose. His character seems a decent fellow  in the beginning but quickly becomes despicable to the audience after his  sickening affections for his daughter are revealed.
Overall, this film  touches base with serious issues, the more pronounced being abortion but  incest, adultery and addiction follow closely behind. Despite the numerous  faults of each of the characters, they all prove that love is the reason  behind their debauched actions. ""The Cider House Rules"" begs to  be understood and appreciated, and there is no argument to how well it  presents itself. One of the best films of '99 standing beside  ""American Beauty"", it will reserve itself a place in people's  hearts and movie libraries for all time.",968630400,3,5352,4.7204767063921995
1110394,4,6305949638,"This movie is really hard to describe. First of all, Michael Caine did a  fine job but his performance didn't strike me as oscar caliber. Secondly,  the movie seemed a bit to preachy about the pros and cons of abortion.  Third, the sex scenes, albeit few, didn't ring true and seemed out of place  in a movie such as this. Although it wasn't difficult watching Charlize  Theron in the scenes, she just seemed a too worldly wise and mature to be  the boyish Tobey Maguire's lover.
All that aside, this movie was a very  pleasant distraction and was oddly fulfilling. The kids in the orphanage  were charming, especially poor little Fuzzy. The rather extensive subplot  at the apple farm, though a bit jarring in its content, lent much to the  feel of the film.
This is an enjoyable film that deals with subjects that  aren't so enjoyable. Overall, this is one to watch again and again, and I  certainly will.",968112000,,907,4.6
1110395,4,6305949638,"How did I miss THE CIDER HOUSE RULES when it was playing in the movie  theaters?  It is a wonderful film.  After watching it this weekend, I am  now a fan.
Michael Cain's performance is remarkable.  Toby McGuire is  very good too.  He achieves success in playing the role of Homer.  McGuire  is believable when playing scenes that require innocence (i.e. the only  movie he's ever seen is KING KONG; he's never been out of the state of  Maine).
I've read Irving's book, but to be honest, don't have a  recollection of it.  Therefore, I watched the film version with open eyes  and cannot compare it to the novel.  However, Irving's writing job on the  screenplay is excellent.  And it was wonderful to see him win the Academy  Award for his efforts.
The DVD is done quite well.  There is a  documentary on the making of the film.  It's a little long on scenes from  the film -- definitely watch it *after* you watch the movie to avoid  spoilers.  The cut scenes section is interesting.  Usually, once you view  the scenes that were cut by the director you agree that they were boring  and added nothing to the movie.  These scenes were curiously lost: for  instance, a scene where the apple-pickers are introduced at dinner; and a  scene where the pickers end up on the roof of the cider house -- a specific  cider house rule, not to be broken!

1110396,5,6305949638,"This film should have been called, ""Magnificent Obsession"".  It  is about love, responsibility, accountability and bending the rules when  necessary to save a life.  Seen through the eyes of a benevolent Doctor (  Michael Caine) and the children he lovingly protects at an orphanage.  We  meet them at birth, watch them grow, be adopted, and rejected, perpetually  waiting to be selected by a ""family.""  We're given a closeup view  of one gifted child ""Homer"" (Tobey Maguire) as he grows up, and  goes out into the world, or at least as far as an apple picking farm and  fishing community by the sea to meet his destiny and love (Charlize  Theron). He finds that life is beautiful yet harsh, raw , complicated,  filled with horrendous moments and decisions. As young Homer says,  ""sometimes you just sit, watch, do nothing, and sometimes you have to  do something!""  In fighting to help others, he finds himself, his  strength, his power, his ""place"", his identity.  This is a  taunt, action packed, graphic, beautiful film.  Not preachy, it has humor,  tension just life - telling it like it is. I guess they couldn't call it  ""Magnificient Obsession"", because that title was used a long time  ago for a Jane Wyman/ Rock Hudson film.  ""Cider House Rules"" has  the same quality in both cast and writing.  The landscapes of  Maine will  capture your heart and so will this film.",968025600,2,1377,4.789699570815451
1110397,2,6305949638,"The only rules or morals the characters have in this story are the ones they made up as they went along in their lives.  The characters all had  experiences which were only made complex through poor personal choices,  resulting mostly from a lack of moral courage.  There were no noble  characters in this story.  Showing Michael Caine's figure slowly killing  himself on ether, while others know but do nothing, reminded me of the  glorification of Nicholas Cage's self-destructive character in  ""Leaving Las Vegas"".
What is worse, is that this movie seduces  its audience (through beautiful film making) into agreeing with its message  that there is no need or benefit to having any consistent or absolute  morals in life.  Most of the characters had some positive qualities which  the film makers used to allow us to be sympathetic to their poor ideals.  In the end, even Homer is corrupted - through a wrong relationship,  changing his position on abortion, and finally by working under forged  credentials.  Obviously, the Hollywood establishment used this movie as a  platform for its pro-abortion ideals.
Great cinematography aside, and  some good acting, this is a movie with many bad messages:  lie when it  makes sense to, performing abortions is not really wrong but helpful,  orphans have no real chance at a good life, work professionally under false  credentials if you know what you're doing, and have sex before marriage  with someone else's girlfriend if it seems right.",967939200,15,1487,5.070539419087137

The commentary is compelling, even though director  Lasse Halstrom's accent is occasionally hard to decipher.  Him, along with  author (and screenplay adapter and Oscar winner) John Irving, add great  insight.  Note, the director's commentary is the best feature, and HARDEST  TO FIND on the menu.  They have added the ""Television Spots""  which is a strange, repetitive journey only for the major time burner.  Great chapter index--the best I have seen with small boxed scenes so you  know exactly what you're looking for! The featurette is good, but the movie  is what is most importantant.

1110430,3,6305949638,"I saw CIDER HOUSE RULES at the movies. Between the publicity at that time, then with its Oscar nominations, and now on Amazon, I have yet to come across anyone saying . . .

1. Isn't everyone getting tired of movie moms being so stupid? Wally's mother has her son's girlfriend Candy fooling around with Homer right under her nose, but she doesn't know it?

2. Homer's fling with Candy proves that, when it's the movies, the guy gets the girl regardless of how much disbelief the audience must suspend. What did he have to offer her that she couldn't get from a guy who didn't look like her little brother?

3. Until I found out Homer and Candy get together in the book version of CIDER HOUSE RULES, I thought their affair was just an excuse to exploit the attractive actress Charlize Theron.

4. CIDER HOUSE RULES was the first film with Michael Caine that I was able to catch at the movies in more than ten years. Great talent always finds its way back on top. As I write this, Michael Caine has appeared in about 90 films.

5. After leaving the orphanage, Homer is the only white person rooming with several black men, but no one so much as blinks? This was 60 years ago, when whites and blacks didn't even drink from the same water fountains. Even today, how many situations do you see where a white person is in the minority, outside of basketball, football, or the latest Tarzan movie?

Anyway, I had a couple of Kleenex at the ready as I was expecting  a tearjerker; alas, I only had to use them once.
The characters are  developed nicely and while the story is a bit saccharine, you can't help  but feel affectionate toward them. I mean, come on, you have a bunch of  cute orphans being shepherded by saint-like caretakers. How can you resist  its charms?
Its pro-choice theme is coveyed in a non-preachy or  self-righteous way, which is nice to see. Tobey Maguire turns in his best  performance to date as a young man searching for his role in life on his  way to adulthood who ventures out on his own only to find his destiny  belongs back where he came from; Michael Caine, as the selfless caretaker  of the orphanage with an addiction to ether, demonstrates his Oscar win for  his supporting role was certainly justified.

Hitchcock (English), or Lasse Hallstrm  (Swedish), the list could be very long, and although John Irving is a very  fine writer (as well as maybe one of the last true humanists) America is so  plagued with ""Politikally Korekt"" that it is almost impossible to  express anything which doesn't comply with.

1110450,5,6305949638,"In 1985, John Irving penned an American classic about a young man's quest for belonging in the world besieged by World War II and self-doubt. The  first script adaptations of the novel would have made for a nine-hour movie  but being a daring writer, Irving trimmed it down to two hours of human  heart and true nature. The result was one of 1999's biggest hits and a Best  Picture Oscar nominee. Tobey Maguire stars as Homer Wells, the central  character, who has been reared in an orphanage in rural Maine from infancy  by a caring doctor named Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine in his superb  Oscar-winning performance). For years, Homer has watched and studied the  practices of Dr. Larch on pregnant women who either wanted an abortion or  refused their babies. When he sees a chance to leave and explore the world  on his own, he takes it and begins a self-quest for his true place in the  world. Where he finds it is in the last place one would think, but it makes  perfect sense once he discovers the true nature behind it. This touching  film made me cry in the theater and it's  a shame that not more people were  willing to see this picture. It only stayed in theaters for about two weeks  at a time. The children will steal your hearts and it is the loving  performance from Caine that drives the film to its tearful and redeeming  finale. Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander are well-cast as the nurses at the  orphanage who stand by Dr. Larch no matter how hard things can get for him  and his illegal practices. The film does not promote or demote the act of  abortion but rather treats it as just a part of the story...and as a fact  of life, that it is a woman's choice. Rachel Portman's beautiful and  touching music score will move you to tears. Even though it was nominated  for an Oscar, it still should have won. The heart of a film can be in its  music and that applies here in every way possible. Caine received a  standing ovation at the Oscar show when he won for Best Supporting Actor  and spent over half his speech time acknowledging the work of his fellow  nominees. John Irving also won for his screenplay adaptation of his own  novel, the first time a novelist had ever won for adapting his own work for  the silver screen since ""Dances With Wolves"" won for 1990.  Outstanding on every level, this film is the pinnacle of the moviemaking  industry for the 20th century, as if to offer hope on life and love and the  lessons we need for the future, which would start with the 21st century.

Unlike the reviewers who have written their reviews before me, I think the  ""abortion"" issue was extremely well done because it was not used  for preachiness but for character development.  Except for a few moments  when the movie lagged a bit, it was certainly one of the most  ""absorbing"" movies lately released, and that's why it has that  relentless drive of the better movies of the 1940s.  I bought this DVD  because Leonard Maltin gave it four stars, and whenever he gives four stars  to any movie, I've never ever been disappointed when I viewed it.  I don't  really agree with Maltin that this is one of the greatest movies ever made  (which is the category I keep for my own five star reviews on Amazon), but  it is certainly a beautiful blend of story, cinematography, setting,  character development, superb ensemble acting, a sure hand at the  directorial chair, a good score, wonderful story development through the  titles (a sure sign of a careful film!), and almost, but not quite, superb  editing.  And welcome back, Michael Caine and Kate Nelligan--two of the  greatest actors of our era, still going strong in roles that are wonderful  for them!  Bottom line: you will like it and maybe even treasure it.",966988800,5,1513,4.8392156862745095

1110455,3,6305949638,"The trailors, the Oscars, and any other advertising will not tell you that abortion is a primary issue in the movie.  That is not to condemn or praise  it being in the film, but people should be aware of that fact.  It is a  Hollywood-liberal flick.  So Homer will only fulfill his destiny once he  sets aside his pro-life, pro-adoption feelings and starts performing  abortions.  It is indeed a propaganda piece, and Irving himself would  concurr.  If you are pro-life, I would not let this deter you from watching  the film.  It has many good qualities.  I just the movie companies should  actually be upfront about it.
Abortion aside, it is not quite as good as  the amount of Oscar nominations would make you think.  Michael Kane gives  an ok performance, but an Oscar win is a joke.  Toby MacGuire does a fine  job and is very likeable.  It is an engaging film with many fine qualities,  I just don't see it being excellent enough to merit four stars.  3 and a  half is posibility though.",966729600,,993,4.517045454545454
1110456,3,6305949638,"Lasse Halstrom's adaptation of John Irving's ""The Cider House Rules"" is the first example of the author completing a screenplay of  his work. He has clearly seen such travesties as ""The Hotel New  Hampshire"" and ""Simon Birch"" (based on ""A Prayer for  Owen Meaney"") and decided that enough is enough - time to get it  right. However on this occasion, while certainly improving on the  aforementioned two films, he still loses some of the skewed humour and  tragedy of the original novel.
Irving, the author, has produced works of  Dickensian genius so it is sad to see this watered down version. It does  contain some brilliant acting with Michael Caine proving he can do more  than the smart alec Cockney's that are his trademark and Delroy Lindo,  whose Mr Rose has a horrifying secret, still has the audience empathising  with his fate. However Tobey Maguire does not engage sufficiently as the  young hero Homer Wells - just a little too clean cut.
If you want to see  a great Irving adaptation, then Robin Williams in ""The World According  To Garp"" is still the best out there. One hopes that Mr Irving will  have another look and perhaps be involved with a film that really does  justice to his superb oeuvre.",966729600,,1214,4.70952380952381
1110457,5,6305949638,"Nineteen ninety-nine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last  year, this is my favorite.  John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of  the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant,  exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human  emotions and experiences.
Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so  broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or  director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a  character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently  done.
This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and  emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong  moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being  human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with  each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that  are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.
If there is one thing  that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are  ordinary people struggling with problems we all face.  We come to have  affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds  us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or  hope.
From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from  Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of `What's  Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe  for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his  finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to  Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a  feeling of pride; and well he should.
This motion picture was beautifully  filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period  props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom,  working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a  way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to  do enough development of each character (often just visually without any  dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an  emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His  work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their  innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.
The acting was  uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right  combination of idealism, naivet and inner strength to make him an  unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with  her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness,  she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but  later proved to be quite complex.
Michael Caine has had a legendary  career spanning close to half a century.  He has long been one of my  favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of  the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character;  egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly,  self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's  ability to span that range was remarkable.
Finally, I have the highest  praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright  smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength  and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his  despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.
After having seen  all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last  year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as  flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its  approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a  shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.",966643200,3,4261,5.040462427745664
1110458,5,6305949638,"This is one of the few movies that consider the audience as human and able to think and feel. I would not say that the movie do spouse abortion.  Abortion is part of the story but which serves as a jumping board for  further reflection or discussion. Watch it, and then, let's discuss after  seeing the movie.",966556800,,309,4.385964912280702
1110459,5,6305949638,"The Cider House Rules is a truly classic and beautiful film. The story-lines, acting, cinematography and scenery, the costumes, the wonderful performances by the children (most notably Erik Per Sullivan from TV's Malcom in the Middle), and the brilliant directing all make this film hearken back to the fantastic old-fashioned days of film-making. It is truly a feast for the eyes.
The film brings to life an era of our history when the voices of women were still pale shadows of the thundering voices of Men and ""the Law."" But/for a few men sensitive to the plight of women, (and to that of the children which so depend upon them), women's voices weren't heard. This film focuses on two men who hear those voices, and who quietly listen while the voices are allowed to grow stronger.
This is Tobey Maguire's breakthrough role. He plays Homer Wells with quiet dignity and curiosity, and it's wonderful. Charlize Theron shines as Maguire's love interest, and Caine is perfect as Wilbur Larch. The role seems made for him, (as Homer Wells does for Maguire).
Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom does here what he did so brilliantly in Something to Talk About, ie: makes nature, the seasons, the snows of winter, the falling leaves of autumn, the sweet ripe sun of summer, all characters in themselves. Swedes are renowned nature-lovers, so this makes sense. Anyone doubting me should see Under the Sun (Under Solen), by Colin Nutley.
A classicly-acted and directed film, this film is one which I think will be looked back on in future years as one of the best films of the nineties. There are several complex and moving storylines, dealing with such issues as racism, abortion, adultery, incest, alcoholism/addiction, the power (both for good and for bad) of the Law, and, perhaps most importantly, the redemptive power of unconditional love.
The film does not boldly draw lines of right and wrong. In fact, much of the film's beauty and power lies in the shades of grey between. The film reflects on a moral world outside of the law, a law of humanity and compassion, of what is right despite what dusty judges in their chambers have decreed. Cider House beautifully lulls us along on a profound journey about human beings just trying to be good people, and the sacrifices which are sometimes made, and not always acknowledged, for them to succeed in doing so.
The Oscar-winning leads are fantastic, but the whole cast really shines here. Singer Erykah Badu's debut performance is excellent, and shows us that she has a successful future in acting waiting should she choose to quit her day job. Delroy Lindo's portrayal of an incestuous father is heart-breaking. And Paul Rudd gives a solid performance in a supporting role.
This is a film which, once seen, will always be remembered.
It reminds me of Titanic or Dead Poet's Society in that it just hits so many of the notes that movies are supposed to. The music, the acting, the scenery, the storylines. A timeless adaptation of a classic, humanist story. Five stars.",966556800,,3014,4.865758754863813
1110480,5,6305949638,"This film was the best in 1999, and possibly the best in several years. Wonderfully portrayed by all involved, the film takes you into their world  and you are very reluctant to leave when it is over. Cider House Rules  expresses the fact that life is made up of shades of gray, not black and  white. And that one must live with one's own decisions and make the best  choices  based on not what others say, but what we feel is right in our  hearts. Tobey Maguire is the ultimate Homer Wells. He brings such depth to  every role he plays, but I believe this is my favorite so far. He is a good  bet to keep your eye on in the future.
Doctor Larch could only be  Michael Caine. The part is him. No other. I could go on...but you must see  for yourself. If you don't, you are truly cheating yourself of a very rich  experience that will affect you for some time to come.",966470400,,867,4.131736526946108

Charlize Theron, Michael Caine, Delroy Lindo, and Erykah Badu all lend  surprisingly strong support in their three-dimensional roles.

1110482,4,6305949638,"Just when thoughtful adults despair that Hollywood will never again make movies for them to enjoy, Cider House Rules comes along and gives everybody  reason to hope. From its wide, opening shot to its literary ending, this  film delivers to its audience an old-fashioned, satisfying, movie-going  experience while at the same time focusing on quite a surprising topic:  abortion. Framed with Dickensian sympathy for all its characters, Cider  House weaves its way in and out of the lives of half a dozen startlingly  original people, many of them quite unusual for mainstream cinema. Michael  Caine picked up the Oscar (he's a great actor but he's become a kind of  beloved pet for middle-aged movie fans) as a drug-addicted humanitarian,  yet Delroy Lindo gives the most haunting and complex performance as the  black foreman of an apple-picking crew who loves his daughter too much.  Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron make this long film continuously  watchable and even warmly sunny despite its repeated turns into dark  material, and a gaggle of adorable moppet orphans keep tugging at the heart  strings, but not so much you feel abused. A rare modern day classic.",966211200,133,1169,5.08421052631579
1110483,3,6305949638,"When a film takes place in two entirely different settings - involving almost two entirely different sets of characters - it inevitably runs the risk that one of the two sides will generate more interest than the other  and that the movie itself will appear to break into halves of unequal  quality.  The end result is that such a film may seem to be disjointed and  lacking in the cohesive unity necessary for any work of genuine art.
""The  Cider House Rules"" runs the risk and falls into the trap.  The first  section, set in a Maine orphanage in 1943, fascinates us not merely with  the sheer novelty of the setting but with the central figure of the piece,  the doctor and caregiver who becomes the focus of our attention.  Brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine, Dr. Larch is a man who provides  love to a collection of children otherwise ignored and abandoned by an  uncaring world.  The most controversial aspect of the character involves  the fact that Dr. Larch also provides abortions for women who want them at  a time when the operation was still illegal and the only other alternative  for many of these women was to suffer at the hands of inept practitioners  of the operation.  ""The Cider House Rules"" is certainly to be commended for  tackling a subject that is virtually taboo in commercial moviemaking -  albeit, it must be stated for those who do not adhere to abortion advocacy  that the slant here is decidedly pro-choice despite the script's making a  few gestures to the anti-abortion viewpoint early on in the film.
The  center of the film is occupied by a young man named Homer Wells, a  twice-rejected orphan who grows up at the orphanage almost as Dr. Larch's  medical prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and whom Dr. Larch appears to be grooming to take over his  practice from him in the future.  The pseudo father-son relationships  between Dr. Larch and Homer and between Homer and the boys who are in his  charge are conveyed with genuine emotional power and heartwarming  believability.  As prospective parents visit the facility, we feel deeply  the desperation these children have to be adopted and to find a place where  they will fit in.  Conversely, we empathize keenly with the sense of  sadness and personal inadequacy that inevitably accompanies each of their  many rejections.  Even more fascinating is the social context in which the  drama plays itself out.  Because of his willingness to perform the  abortions, Dr. Larch's position at the orphanage has come under attack from  the board of trustees that runs the institution.  Thus, we are all primed  for a gripping showdown between these two opposing forces and wonder how  Homer will fit into the proceedings.
Unfortunately, the author John  Irving pulls the rug out from under us as he decides to take his story off  into an almost entirely different direction.  Feeling that he is missing  out on a whole vast world waiting for him beyond the confines of this  remote, isolated community, Homer, rather understandably for a sheltered  young man, decides to abruptly leave the orphanage and to start life anew  as an apple picker when he meets a soldier whose beautiful wife has come to  the doctor for an abortion and whose family is in the cider making  business.  Although Homer's sudden farewell results in a scene of great  emotional power, as a whole torrent of conflicting emotions come flooding  out of both Homer and the people he is leaving behind, the fact is that we  sorely miss the orphanage once we are ripped away from it.  Somehow, the  scenes on the farm - and they constitute well more than half of the film's  running time - never match in intensity and interest those that have come  before.  In fact, the least original and impressive aspect of the film is  the predictable and conventional adulterous affair that Homer and the  soldier's wife, Candy (Charlize Theron), indulge in when her fighter-bomber  husband returns to the war.  Has there ever in the movies been a case of a  beautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on  a mission overseas?  The theme of the story - as represented by the posted  list of  ""cider house rules"" that we are told by one of the characters are  not too be followed because whoever wrote them didn't live in the cider  house - seems to be that rules are made to be broken, although in some  cases - such as incest - the violation goes so far over the edge that such  an act will always result in disastrous consequences for the perpetrator.  Throughout the film, the characters always seem to be abandoning the rules  set out for them by society.  Dr. Lance performs illegal operations,  creates a phony resume and a set of counterfeit documents in an attempt to  get the board to hire Homer as his assistant, and even deceives Homer into  believing he suffers from a serious heart ailment to keep him out of the  service.  Homer himself seems to suffer little guilt as he pursues a love  affair with the wife of the man who has kindly entrusted him with a job  when he most needs it.
More interesting than this theme, however, is  the more subtle one of parents - whether real or ersatz - learning to let  go of the child in whom one has invested all one's dreams and hopes for the  future.  The genuine heartbreak Dr. Lance suffers as Homer leaves to find a  new place in the world becomes almost palpable as written on Caine's  beautifully expressive, craggy face.  Unfortunately, this aspect of the  film is, understandably I suppose, played out almost entirely in scenes in  which letters are exchanged back and forth between the two principals and  in which their feelings are conveyed in the rather undramatic form of  voice-over narration.  In fact, after Homer leaves, Dr. Lance becomes  virtually a minor character in the story and, with his withdrawal from the  scene of action, much of the emotional energy of the earlier portions  drains out of the film.
Director Lasse Hallstrom deserves high praise for  the fine performances he has drawn from a uniformly excellent cast.  As  Homer, Tobey Maguire brings a quiet, understated niceness to the pivotal  role. Particularly noteworthy are the young boys who fill the early  sections of the film with so much infectious life and emotion.  They are  cute without being adorable, touching without being cloying.  Hallstrom has  also captured the alternately lush, alternately bleak Maine landscape to  striking effect.",966124800,3,6450,4.780309936189608
1110484,5,6305949638,"The idea of this movie captured me long before it first hit theatre. An orphanage where hopes never die, and a boy who needs to make it in the  world before he learns his real calling in the place where he was born and  raised. It almost has a mesmerizing quality to it. Combined with the  amazing writing talent of John Irving and outstanding actors such as Toby  McGuire and Michael Caine makes this movie memorable and strong!
The  movie, set in a time period where many children were orphaned by the  various changes the era had to offer focuses on a small orphanage in St.  Cloud's, Maine, where abortions are not uncommon, the children grow up, and  learn the feeling of dissapointment, when a little girl with blond hair and  blue eyes is chosen by a family before a little boy with a runny nose and  charming smile, and so the competition continues with only small glimmers  of hope for each child, and some, like Fuzzy Stone, a small boy with lung  problems, never gets to have the family of his dreams. When the lead boy,  Homer (McGuire) leaves to find a new future by the ocean and earning a  living working at a small orchard with Migrant workers, he learns about  life, the kind of love he never knew he had experienced, and where he truly  belongs.
This story, although it is pretty far off from the book, is a  masterpiece all of it's own. Amazing acting, strong characters, and a  healthy dose of reality from that period of life makes this movie memorable  and a definite find. Check it out, and you won't be dissapointed!",966038400,,1540,4.474820143884892
1110485,4,6305949638,"The title of the movie has spelled out the theme, though it takes you some time to know what it means at the very beginning.
Overall speaking, it is  a very balanced movie that can attract your attention to the end. The theme  was dealt with through the dialogues of different characters inside it -  why should someone set down rules for things which they don't really  involved in? The theme was brought up by the abortion controversy and the  cider house rules.
Nonetheless, there are some side lines which worth  further thoughts. One of them is the ""affair"" between Toby and  Charlize, who claimed that she was not good in being alone. Was there real  love between them? Or is Toby just a means for her to satisfy her physical  and emotional desires? That was not really tackled. Charlize returned to  her original boy friend to take care of him, but is this out of love or  duties? In fact, was the affair between her and Toby really necessary? I  tend to take the orientation that, this part of the movie has in fact  spoiled the plot of the movie instead of coloring it. This movie can still  live without emotional love for it still has peer love, love between a  teacher and a student, care among colleagues, friendship etc. Why bother  adding this part to it?
The other one was the incest relation of the  cider house rule manager and her daughter. It did provide a dramatic effect  to the whole story and of course it paved way for Toby to return to the  orphanage to succeed Michael's role as the doctor and manager. However, at  the same time, it made the atmosphere of the story very heavy, and  sometimes too heavy for the audience.
Michael's view on abortion is  disputable, but worth some deeper thoughts. However I personally do not  agree his doings of faking qualifications, despite it was for good. Also  the management of life and death, the King Kong movie show, the nurses at  the orphanage etc. all added up some good elements to the  movie.
Nontheless, the superb performance of each of the roles in the  movie did really help to make the movie a real good one. You can feel their  feelings and draw yourself in the story as if you were among them watching  and participating in what was happening. Of course, needless to say, the  perfect match of the soundtrack has given the movie a pair of wings to take  flight.",965952000,,2343,4.507142857142857

1110487,4,6305949638,"John Irving adapted his novel for the screen and kept many of the best parts. The film is set in rural Maine in the late 1930s. Much of the film centers of the orphanage run by the crusty Dr. Larch, wonderfully played by Michael Caine. He cares deeply for the orphans, especially for the grown-up Homer (Tobey Maguire) who has remained at the orphanage. The scenes in the orphanage are very touching, and the hurt that Larch feels when Tobey chooses to leave the orphanage is quite real. The movie also tells the tale of Tobey's life outside of the orphanage (and shows the doctor trying to get him back) as Tobey works on an apple farm. The characters are very well-drawn and very believable. Most of the film is quite engaging, though I found that it sometimes dragged when we moved from the Larch/Tobey relationship. In particular, there was a very rather extended and unsettling subplot of incest in a farmworker's family that really did not add much to the movie at all.
By and large, this is a very good movie with great characters, real human interest, and and an excellent viusal look in terms of the period it covers. If you like the movie, the book builds on it very nicely, though the plot diverges in that it takes the story well beyond the time covered by the movie.",965952000,2,1279,4.517241379310345
1110488,4,6305949638,"Director Lasse Hallstrom, who gave us the beautiful ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", admirably presents the nuances of character, emotion,  and relationships that make John Irving's bittersweet adaptation of his own  novel so compelling. Michael Caine, his American accent aside, excels as  the parternal Dr. Larch and Tobey Maguire is well-cast as Homer, the  doe-eyed youth who ventures from the familial orphanage to experience life.  The cinematography is exquisite and evocative. As Homer ultimately learns,  the validity of the Cider House Rules (and, by extension, all rules) is  subjective; but, by the time we reach this epiphany, it hardly seems  revelatory considering Homer was raised by an abortionist, and one who  taught him the trade, at that. There is a lot of love here, but also a  moral ambivalence. In this film, as in life, there are no easy answers.  It's for you to decide. Just be sure you see it.",965692800,,921,5.073333333333333

However, it was a really powerful  movie, filled with beauty, emotion, and excellent performances by Michael  Caine, Tobey Maguire, Erica Badu, and Cherlize Theron.  I did think that  Tom Cruise was far better in ""Magnolia"", then Michael Caine was  here, but I really thought that Caine pulled off the guilt of abortion,  very well.  Also, everyone has a bias to cute, little orphans.  Lasse  Halstrom's handywork is amazing and is a director that deserves a lot more  credit in Hollywood.
