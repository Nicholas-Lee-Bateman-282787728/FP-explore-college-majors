3056622,5,B0010YVCB6,I love this Movie. It was the last one on the shelf when I grabbed it and I did not regret it one bit. Don't listen to the first guy that shared his opinion about this movie. He must be a fuzzy fan because he has no idea what he is talking about. This movie is a good movie. It has some twist and turns. I am forever Jason and Wesley fan. I can't complain. Go see it for yourself and be the judge.,1203638400,3,397,3.738095238095238

3056640,4,B0010YVCB6,"**** 3-1/2 Stars **** I have always like Jason Statham, starting with 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,' and continuing with all his work since.  But I'm not sure how such a tough, taciturn and often brutal character (he always plays the same character) can always keep his tongue in his cheek, but somehow, he does it.  Anyway, I love this flick (""Chaos"") not just for Statham, but for all the twists and turns and (yes) the chaos of the plot.  Just sit back and let it happen.  And when you're done, do check out the Pulitzer Prize-nominated book, ""Chaos"" by  James Gleick - the very same book so prominently featured in the last few scenes of this movie.  It is a fascinating and very accessible book, even for those of us who aren't all happy and cozy with physics and math - you need neither - and  it is simply mind-blowing ... you will feel smarter for having read it (as you should.)  And you will never hear a dripping faucet the same way again ... chaos, baby.",1502582400,2,974,4.402234636871508

They made up a story about the Buddha, badly misrepresent Chaos theory, and of course the black guy (Snipes) dies and the white guy lives and gets all the money. Also a lot of pish about how ""good"" cops would have stayed good if they hadn't have shot an innocent women by accident (white, and daughter of someone important, of course, so you care).

Shane Dekker learns that the reason for breaking into the bank was to get onto the Regional Bank computer terminal--no passwords, no hacks, just a direct line to the mainframe. They introduced a virus that transferred amounts under $100 out of millions of accounts: over one billion dollars total. We learn that Jason York was the former partner of Quentin Conners.

3056659,4,B0010YVCB6,"High School Level Plot.  While a good movie is supposed to be partially predictable and partially unpredictable, this film has too much effort in the final few minutes toward unpredictability, while the majority of the film was predictable, which made it boring (but too boring) throughout the first 99 percent of the movie.  And, yes, the end was a surprise, but it seemed...too perfect...too ""Silence of the Lambs"" of a surprise.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but there needed to be more unpredictability throughout.  Heck, I even predicted that Statham wasn't dead in the explosion, because it seemed too obvious that a twist was coming, and the explosion - in appearing that there was no way Statham's character could live - was an automatic invitation for doubt of the same.

3056670,2,B0010YVCB6,"I gave up with thirty minutes to go.  A very pedestrian film.  Statham plays his usual role.  He knows more than everyone else.  Hes surly.  And, he figures things out and beats up bad guys.

Snipes plays Snipes.

 Phillipe does the best he can with what he has to work but, he simply has to use his talents in silly scenes and sillier dialogue.  When Phillipe is riding a motorcycle in coat and tie and helmet, his character does fantastic stunts with the bike.  When Phillipe is shown with his helmet, it reminds me of presidential candidate, Mike Dukakis when he donned that silly helmet and road in a tank.
As I watched the peripheral characters, I speculated that this was their first acting job.

3056802,5,B0010YVCB6,"This film is filled with action, car chases, shootings, fist fighting, anger, and suspense from the moment it begins when a detective (Jason Statham) is suspended from the police force because a daughter of a prominent politician is killed during a hostage taking. This is followed by an apparent bank robbery when some forty or more people are taken hostage and the senior robber (Wesley Snipes) insists that he will only negotiate with Statham. The police agree and Statham is reinstated. Matters go wrong, the bank blows up, and the robbers are able to escape. The police need to find out what was taken, who were the robbers, why did they want to negotiate with Statham, and catch them. Statham is portrayed as an angry man who believes that the only way to catch criminals is to ""bend the law,"" a Dirty Harry type character. He is partnered with a young college-educated man who wants to live up to his ""hero father,"" also a cop, who had died in service. Both Statham and the young men are very knowledgeable and resourceful.
The theme of the film is the ""Chaos Theory"": matters seem to be chaotic, unrelated, yet by analysis they can be seen to be related. Thus, despite the many actions and suspense, the film is filled with what may appear to be unrelated matters, red herrings, but are they?",1421798400,5,1300,4.656521739130435

Let's just say that this is one of Jason Statham's better roles though his fleeting American accent is noticeable. For those who forgot how good Wesley Snipes was before his troubles this is a good chance to reacquaint yourself with him.  Ironically both Statham and Snipes will be reunited in the upcoming ""Expendables 3"".  They may have been premature in giving away the denouement but I'll leave that for the viewer to decide.

3056862,1,B0010YVCB6,"First, I bought this in the two-pack along with ""The Bank Job,"" which I liked.  I did not want to review that pack because the low score for this film would ruin the rating for that set!

This film is clearly one of THE worst ever made and that I have ever seen!  I could write ten pages on how awful this was, but i'll do what I can.  The director, Ton Giglio, clearly does not know what he is doing. The timing is off; the editing is not really there; there is not really any music to keep you into it; the actors are THE worst and must be doing on the job training!  Many people hope to break into Hollywood and film in order to make an easy living, but some get the hook up and have no clue as to what to do!

This film advertises Wesley Snipes, but he is in it for about four scenes!  He is in the opening scene, then you don't see him again for like 35 minutes, at which point when you do see him again, it is briefly and you forgot that he was in it!  Clearly they must have paid Snipes a decent amount just to do what little he did or he owed someone a favor!  They had the nerve to include a 'behind the scenes' featurette on this garbage!  That was more exciting that the film itself!  You know Snipes is a great actor as he tried to make it look like the film was good when it was horrible!

Jason Statham was in it of course, and they never explain why an English guy made detective in the US.  He and Snipes were totally useless in this film as this movie had not smart plot and it tried to seem clever.  If it had better people working on it, maybe it could have been better.  It only had a $12M budget, so that could explain it, although I have seem better done for about the same.

Only Snipes (whose acting was very far and above everyone else's) and Statham knew any kind of half-way believable acting, everyone else were people i have never seen before and these must have been their first roles or auditions - they were like C or D grade 'actors.'  I truly believe that I could have done better my first time out.  For example, one girl is being held hostage at gunpoint.  She shows ZERO emotion and almost looks as if she is waiting for the other actors to fish their lines before she makes her next move.  She did not look nor react like someone whose life was on the line!  She did act kind of hysterical - AFTER she was release!  The director could have corrected that - IF he were any good,

The editing was horrible as well.  There was one what was supposed to have been a 'high-speed' chase, but it looked low-speed because the editing was not tight and the stunts look worse that what you see on old ""Hart to Hart"" episodes!  It is as if most involved were doing this for the first time!  Youtube amateurs do a much better job!

Now for the Blu-Ray quality.  I do not think this is HD, I think this is a DVD print converted to BD.  The colors are washed out, there is no detail, the sound is not good and the shots of Seattle (clearly chosen because of budget) looked gloomy and noisy, but not detailed.  This is not archive quality and the picture quality adds to the disappointment.  Maybe it was filmed in digital?  Whichever the case, the quality is not good, so stay far away from this!  This is not even worth seeing just to say you saw it.",1387152000,,3274,4.105511811023622

3056868,4,B0010YVCB6,I like Statham because he delivers entertainment within a violent action genre. Here the plot is more twisty with Statham playing above the usual straight action man by playing an intelligent action protagonist bent on revenge. You have all the pieces laid out before you to make the twist at he end work. You won't see the end coming but you are not deprived of the clues which make it plausible and entertaining.,1379116800,,414,4.684931506849315

From start to finish this movie is spectacular. Snipes, though his role was smaller than I had originally imagined gave a great performance, and statham once again left me feeling admiration for the actor. The twist were wonderful and I felt completely satisfied in Philipe's performance too. He really did well taking the lead and investigation. I'd say if you have doubts based on the trailers or misconceptions over Snipes don't this is a great and entertaining movie. I have new respect for Snipes, Philipe  and the entire cast.

This movie seems to follow all the norms for his fare; the director and writers support the idea.  We are intrigued by the seemingly diabolical bad guy; what is he trying to do?  Why does he seem partly amused?  How is he staying ahead of the game so well?  And how can our hero die well before the end of the movie???  The constant referrals to ""chaos"" serve...what?

3056918,4,B0010YVCB6,"Just look at the three starring lead actors in Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham, and Ryan Philippe. What could possibly go wrong with a movie featuring these three in a shifting triangle? You're expecting a ""no"" here, yes? Well, no, that's a no. For an action thriller/crime drama, it succeeds on all but one level.

Snipes has little to do and plays mostly a walk-through role. That's a bit disappointing as I find him an excellent actor, but it's all part of the Big Picture of the theme of the story. Who is he? The answer depends on the which part of the story we're in. Does Snipes play a good guy or a villain?

Ryan Philippe is such a pretty boy that I am always so surprised by the intensity and high level of consummate acting and moral center he brings to each role. That pouty bottom lip also serves him well. In this role he plays Jason Statham's young, new partner and son of a hero cop killed in action. He tells the Statham character, ""I didn't understand why they thought a cop killed on the job was a hero.""

Philippe has a way of dissecting each scene and piece of evidence, much like a half-Aghan, half-pit bull would--elegant but determined. This is the third film I've seen him in and really like him as an actor.

The story is a who done it, why, and how--much much typical EXCEPT for two things that simply astonished me and caused one more star than I would have given. Jason Statham, that English actor whose accent I barely comprehend at times, admonishes one character who uses a double negative. Wow! Then this actor who spends 97% of his time-on-screen in some wild action scene, has a book on Chaos theory in his book shelf (a book of intelligent gleanings). When Philippe pulls the book out of its slot, he reads some of the highlighted sections and discovers how these random scribblings were worked into the  crime drama of the day. So how is this book with these actions found in Statham's character's house? This is another part of that Big Picture. By the way, Statham plays a cop on penalty leave for an ""unnecessary"" killing.

But where is Snipes? And who is he?

AT last the viewer discovers the truth (mais non, I will not reveal it!) and it leaves the viewer oddly dissatisfied. This turn-about ending impacts the reader, leaving him disappointed and truly surprised. But maybe, just maybe, a little pleased.",1308441600,2,2345,4.542654028436019

3056921,2,B0010YVCB6,"Sometimes I cannot believe what Hollywood gives the green light. Sure, this is just an action flick and I can lower my expectations accordingly. Still, even with lowering the bar this movie is unintentionally funny. For example, when Ryan Phillipe is asked why he became a cop, Ryan responds ""To finish what my dad started."" Seriously, that's in the movie! And there is all the wacky back-story melodrama one might expect from a high school play thrown in, overflowing even the gaudiest cliche ridden hopes of the untalented. Deserving of a full bowl of raspberries is Wesley Snipes. His goofy mugging at the camera is epic and truly hysterical. Sometimes, even when spouting the worst of dialogues, the action in an action movie displays some cause for bringing a movie to completion. Not so, here. The action is not bad, per se, but the obvious stunt doubles and quick edits away from the action reveal a level of competence that can only aspire to mediocrity. Indeed, the action is mediocre.

Saving the movie for me is Jason Statham whom I find very watchable in action roles, even if his acting is never particularly nuanced. Lastly, I could not take my eyes off of Justine Waddell!

3056924,4,B0010YVCB6,"Written and directed by Tony Giglio, Chaos (2005), is a slickly executed, gritty, crime thriller, that is somewhat reminiscent of The Usual Suspects.  Spinning several plates in the air, the film requires that you pay close attention.

A gang of criminals has taken hostages inside a bank.  Their leader Lorenz (Wesley Snipes), requests that suspended cop Quentin Conners (Jason Statham), be brought in to oversee the situation.  Conners agrees to take charge of the situation, and detective Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe), on his first day as a member of Seattle PD, is assigned as Conners' partner.  Already on the scene at the bank, are detectives Teddy Galloway (Justine Waddell), and Vincent Durano (Nicholas Lea).  Unfortunately things do not go as planned, and an explosion rocks the bank.  When the smoke clears, Lorenz and his gang are gone, but mysteriously, no cash or valuables seem to be missing.

The investigative team gets a lead to one of the gang members, which turns up a load of cash.  The money is traced to the police evidence room, but the cop who was responsible for the cash, is soon found murdered.  Connors and Dekker, get a lead to another member of the gang, a computer specialist, but as they arrive on the scene, he is killed by Lorenz.  It continues to be a busy night, as the cops get a tip, and stake out a house where Lorenz is supposed to meet some of his buddies.  But things go very sour, as the house explodes with Connors inside.

It has indeed been a very long first day for Shane Dekker, but he refuses to give up.  With the help of a police computer tech, he learns that over a billion dollars, has been stolen from the bank, via a computer virus.  He continues to unravel the mystery, discovering a lead to Lorenz's identity, and a tell-tale clue, points him to the truth.  As the new day breaks, Dekker has discovered the truth, and made sense from the chaos.

Ryan Phillippe, is excellent and very believable, in the movie's key role, as the earnest investigator, who proves himself much more capable than he may appear.  Jason Statham might be best-known for his performances in comic book type action films, but he is a very capable actor, and demonstrates that here.  Wesley Snipes has a complex role, which he executes with flash and style.  The supporting cast is solid and capable, down to the minor roles, helping to add to the film's realism.

Chaos is a very well written, nicely paced, entertaining crime thriller.  With a tight timeline, the twist and reveal, fall into place quite neatly.  It is a film that stands up well to repeated viewings.  Though not without flaws, the interesting characters, and smooth execution, makes its imperfections easy to overlook.

Bah, humbug. What a waste of time. If you have any feel for quality crime thrillers at all, you've got to laugh at this, in all the wrong ways.

Bad, hackneyed script. Wooden performances in general. Miserable direction; you can tell a bad director when every line out of everyone's mouth feels forced. This felt at nearly all times like a bad tv movie-of-the-week. I like Statham but he's wasted here and clearly needs a director with a better feel for realism. Snipes is ok and Phillippe is too, but his role is overwritten and just seems fake. I didn't buy one second of this movie.

Sure, there's a twist at the end, but when nothing that came before makes you care about the tale or the players, what's the difference? There are so many flicks of this ilk out there, and I'd recommend most of them before this insipid jello.

3056932,3,B0010YVCB6,"Director Tony Giglio says, in the 'Making Of' Special Feature for ""Chaos"", that he wanted to recapture the spirit and gritty, pre-CGI 'look' of the great 'Cop' movies of the 1970s (""The French Connection"", ""The Seven-Ups"", etc.), and technically, he succeeds, quite admirably...but the film lacks equally important factors to the earlier films' success; characters you care about, and a truly novel 'spin' to the traditional plotline. ""Chaos"" is predictable, with little character development, relying on the stars' established screen personas to carry the story, and the end result is routine, at best.

When a team of masked criminals rob a major Seattle bank, the leader (a swaggering Wesley Snipes) informs the police surrounding the bank that he wants disgraced cop Jason Statham to serve as the negotiator. Statham, who'd been involved in an earlier, fatal hostage negotiation, is pulled off suspension, teamed up with brilliant young detective Ryan Phillippe, and attempts to resolve the situation...but things fall apart, explosively, and the gang escapes in the fire and smoke. As the press again berates Statham, Phillippe begins putting the pieces together, revealing a far more complex scheme than a simple robbery...leading to a 'surprising' climactic revelation (which you'll figure out long before he does!)

The film isn't terrible (there's one really good chase, early in the film), but as you've likely seen all this before, it isn't terribly involving, either. Phillippe takes the acting honors, Statham gets in a few good one-liners (but less of his 'signature' physical action than his fans may like), and Snipes mugs his way through another 'villainous' role.

3056936,2,B0010YVCB6,"After watching this film, I exited the theatre (this title was just released in Korean theaters) and hit shuffle on my iPod, which currently has a little over 8000 songs on it.  The first song to pop up was ""Chaos"" by U.N.K.L.E. off of their album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psyence-Fiction/dp/B00000AFK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psyence Fiction</a>.  No fooling.  Aside from the fact that it was an extraordinary coincidence, I also mention this because it was the most entertaining part of my movie-going experience, and it happened after the flick was over.

The song is only okay, but it's certainly better than the film, a tepid ""action"" movie that claims to have a story built on the Chaos Theory once made so famous by Jeff Goldblum's character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park/dp/B00003CXAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park</a>.  The idea is that chaos is never truly random, and that in even the most cluttered of incidents, patterns emerge.

The theory is debatable, especially if this movie is meant to be one of its proponents.  After some exposition-heavy credits, several somber looking bank robbers (led by Wesley Snipes) take over a major branch of American Global in Seattle.  When hostage negotiations begin, the bad guys demand that disgraced officer Conners (Statham) be given the helm.  Unfortunately, as soon as he's put in charge, things go sideways.

Aiding Conners is a newly appointed detective played by Ryan Phillipe, who refuses to act in every scene, relying almost exclusively on this pouty, petulant look he can do with his poofy lips.  Phillipe's character begins to steadily assemble the clues, sorting through the baffling array of red herrings to some supposed truth about chaos that the bad guys may or may not be trying to prove.  Scattered about the meandering script are a few lukewarm ""action"" sequences (including one of the dullest vehicle chases I've seen in a long while) and lots and lots of cringe-worthy dialogue.  In fact, when one of the officers announces that ""he wasn't just a better cop than you; he was also a better man,"" I suddenly realized I was watching a bad movie.

In addition to all of this, there are stupid emotional back stories, unbelievable twists of misdirection, and even some insulting flashbacks as Phillipe puzzles it all out, in case the audience still doesn't get it.  Chaos, as a condition, can have its crafty corners and intriguing entanglements.  It can, in its own way, be beautiful.  In fact, of all the adjectives I think of when chaos comes to mind, ""boring"" is none of them, which makes me think this film is seriously misnamed.",1238284800,6,2732,5.390588235294118

There is none for this movie, since the plot was so involved that any attempt to summarize it would violate the spirit of brevity of a Short Attention Span Summary.

The writers did a great job in keeping this plot from becoming hackneyed with so much misdirection.

Example: The man who was shot at the beginning was a black man-- and so we assumed that Wesley Snipes character was going to be playing the Vengeful Relative's role. As it turns out, this was not true.

Example: Jason Stataham's character we initially thought was the good guy, but it turns out that he was the bad guy.

The acting was good and Wesley Snipes was so obnoxious that it seemed that he had a genetic gift for playing such roles.

He accomplished his goal.  ""Chaos"" doesn't challenge you in any emotional way.  It's more of a mystery than an action film, trying to figure out who done it.

Jason Statham is now a major action star.

I thought, ""Now, that's over the top"" & rewound it, but he actually looks pretty good.  He appears pretty banged up and leaves blood on the side of his head between locations.  One imagines that they were short of towels and water in Seattle.

Wesley Snipes won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for ""One Night Stand"" in 1997.  He does a good job in this picture, but most likely won't be picking up a statue.

She's a pretty confused girl as far as relationships, and wouldn't you know that she didn't turn off her cell phone?!?

Ty Olsson who I've been watching as Sam on TV's ""Men In Trees,"" plays the bad guy who winds up in the hospital.  He does a good job of being very different, making me stretch to connect him with television.  There's also a small part done well by the bank manager Rob LaBelle who has appeared in many television series like ""The 4400"" & ""The Dead Zone.""

The acting was dead pan through out the cast except for the news reporter at the start of the movie who seemed to be the only person who was trying. It probably had a lot to do with the abismal script.

The writers don't seem to have ever learned the word subtle because all they do is beat you over the head with ""hints"" and things that will be important later. It's like a crappy magician saying look over there to do their magic verses one who uses subtle misdirection to pull it off. In addition to that the writers don't know how to write women at all. There's a scene where a female character trhows herslef at Ryan Phillippe after having just met him in a way that would have gotten her fired from any job except phone sex operator, and as my wife pointed out, he's not hot enough for most girls to do that. Sorry Ryan. Also any writer that is so dumb they use the phrase ""it's not rocket surgery."" as a serious statement and not a joke needs to be beaten with a lead pipe. While being the most hillarious moment in the moviethe dead pan acting makes it seem as though it was a serious statement.

Another personal beef I have with this movie is that Jason Statham's character who is from the nort west hates the Pac 10 and thinks it's over rated. You don't EVER hear someone in the NW say that about the Pac 10. We're very loyal to our schools and the only place I've ever heard something like that is from other conferences that get butt hurt that the Pac 10 consistantly has teams in the top 25. While we're on the subject of the North West, lets talk about the amazing stock footage they used for the city too. So it's set in Seattle, but they don't use stock footage of Seattle. Not once. On top of that it's got that grainy VHS look like they taped it off a movie on HBO in the 80s and were saving it for a special occasion. Also for an action movie it didn't have very much action, and when it was present the fighting was poorly coreographed.
The fight scene where they break a mirror in a bathroom you can see the guy getting thrown into the mirror look over his shoulder to make sure he's lined up right, also you can see that the mirror is already broken from a previous attempt. I'm not one of those guys who freeze frames his way through movies, the mistakes were that glaring. This is hands down the worst movei I've ever seen. Go watch the transporter, or crank, or any of his other movies, but skip this attrocity.",1211500800,10,2822,4.214417744916821

There are twists,  some that aren't super surprising, but it does keep you guessing throughout the movie was to who the evil mastermind is.  The car chase in the middle of the movie with Ryan Phillipe was garbage though, it detracts from an otherwise smart movie with a very 1980's CHIPs style impossible fake car chase.

I would highly suggest that this movie be purchased, but I will be waiting for it to come out on Blu-ray. I hope I don't have to wait too long...",1204156800,4,490,4.579545454545454
3056954,4,B0010YVCB6,"According to one reference source, 'The name ""chaos theory"" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data.', and to enjoy the ride in this action film, understanding the chaos theory is helpful if not essential. In writing and directing CHAOS, Tony Giglio (as he explains in one of the featurettes on the DVD) worked to make an action movie that was more than just pyrotechnics and killing (though those are in abundance in this film!), and instead return to the atmosphere of older 'French Connection' type crime dramas.  To accomplish this he uses the chaos theory to create just enough twists to keep the audience surprised.  If the film doesn't open new doors for the genre, it certainly supplies enough entertainment to make it worth watching.

The film opens on a bridge in Seattle where an incident involving  detective Quentin Connors (Jason Statham) and another unidentified detective results in Connors being dismissed from the police force. A sophisticated bank heist ensues and the head of the heist is one Lorenz (Wesley Snipes) who, when surrounded by the police after an explosion jolts the neighborhood, demands to negotiate the hostages situation with Connors: Captain Jenkins (Henry Czerny) and a new police recruit Detective Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe) recruit the reluctant, fired Connors to return to Seattle to take charge - with Dekker as his partner.  From this point on the story is a mlange of mind-bending assaults on the back using the chaos theory to trace the elements of discovery.  Just when the audience is comfortable with knowing the good guys from the bad guys, the chessboard turns and surprises occur that leave the story with a sense of incomplete thought on the part of the script, but also an appreciation for the degree of suspense the story has presented.

The strong character in the film is Ryan Phillippe who is able to hold his own with the practiced action hero antics of Statham and Snipes.  There are some standout cameos, such as Keegan Connor Tracy who has one of the more sensually seductive roles on film, Henry Czerny as the forceful super chief, and Justine Waddell and Nicholas Lea as the detectives who shoulder the only truth in the tale. Not a great action movie but one with a modicum of intelligence that makes is rise above the many others in this category.  Grady Harp, February 08",1203984000,28,2479,4.925659472422062

Anyway, I love this flick (""Chaos"") not just for Statham, but for all the twists and turns and (yes) the chaos of the plot.  Just sit back and let it happen.  And when you're done, do check out the Pulitzer Prize-nominated book, ""Chaos"" by  James Gleick - the very same book so prominently featured in the last few scenes of this movie.  It is a fascinating and very accessible book, even for those of us who aren't all happy and cozy with physics and math - you need neither - and  it is simply mind-blowing ... you will feel smarter for having read it (as you should.)

 Phillipe does the best he can with what he has to work but, he simply has to use his talents in silly scenes and sillier dialogue.

The leading cop  who you would expect to either capture or Kill the bad guy (Lesly Snipes) gets Killed towards the end of the movie while the Rockie cop ends up being the super hero which is SO UNBELIEVABLE that he would end up killing the main Villein.

3291299,5,B0010YVCB6,"This film is filled with action, car chases, shootings, fist fighting, anger, and suspense from the moment it begins when a detective (Jason Statham) is suspended from the police force because a daughter of a prominent politician is killed during a hostage taking. This is followed by an apparent bank robbery when some forty or more people are taken hostage and the senior robber (Wesley Snipes) insists that he will only negotiate with Statham. The police agree and Statham is reinstated. Matters go wrong, the bank blows up, and the robbers are able to escape. The police need to find out what was taken, who were the robbers, why did they want to negotiate with Statham, and catch them. Statham is portrayed as an angry man who believes that the only way to catch criminals is to ""bend the law,"" a Dirty Harry type character. He is partnered with a young college-educated man who wants to live up to his ""hero father,"" also a cop, who had died in service. Both Statham and the young men are very knowledgeable and resourceful.
The theme of the film is the ""Chaos Theory"": matters seem to be chaotic, unrelated, yet by analysis they can be seen to be related. Thus, despite the many actions and suspense, the film is filled with what may appear to be unrelated matters, red herrings, but are they?",1421798400,5,1300,4.656521739130435

Let's just say that this is one of Jason Statham's better roles though his fleeting American accent is noticeable. For those who forgot how good Wesley Snipes was before his troubles this is a good chance to reacquaint yourself with him.  Ironically both Statham and Snipes will be reunited in the upcoming ""Expendables 3"".  They may have been premature in giving away the denouement but I'll leave that for the viewer to decide.

3291359,1,B0010YVCB6,"First, I bought this in the two-pack along with ""The Bank Job,"" which I liked.  I did not want to review that pack because the low score for this film would ruin the rating for that set!

This film is clearly one of THE worst ever made and that I have ever seen!  I could write ten pages on how awful this was, but i'll do what I can.  The director, Ton Giglio, clearly does not know what he is doing. The timing is off; the editing is not really there; there is not really any music to keep you into it; the actors are THE worst and must be doing on the job training!  Many people hope to break into Hollywood and film in order to make an easy living, but some get the hook up and have no clue as to what to do!

This film advertises Wesley Snipes, but he is in it for about four scenes!  He is in the opening scene, then you don't see him again for like 35 minutes, at which point when you do see him again, it is briefly and you forgot that he was in it!  Clearly they must have paid Snipes a decent amount just to do what little he did or he owed someone a favor!  They had the nerve to include a 'behind the scenes' featurette on this garbage!  That was more exciting that the film itself!  You know Snipes is a great actor as he tried to make it look like the film was good when it was horrible!

Jason Statham was in it of course, and they never explain why an English guy made detective in the US.  He and Snipes were totally useless in this film as this movie had not smart plot and it tried to seem clever.  If it had better people working on it, maybe it could have been better.  It only had a $12M budget, so that could explain it, although I have seem better done for about the same.

Only Snipes (whose acting was very far and above everyone else's) and Statham knew any kind of half-way believable acting, everyone else were people i have never seen before and these must have been their first roles or auditions - they were like C or D grade 'actors.'  I truly believe that I could have done better my first time out.  For example, one girl is being held hostage at gunpoint.  She shows ZERO emotion and almost looks as if she is waiting for the other actors to fish their lines before she makes her next move.  She did not look nor react like someone whose life was on the line!  She did act kind of hysterical - AFTER she was release!  The director could have corrected that - IF he were any good,

The editing was horrible as well.  There was one what was supposed to have been a 'high-speed' chase, but it looked low-speed because the editing was not tight and the stunts look worse that what you see on old ""Hart to Hart"" episodes!  It is as if most involved were doing this for the first time!  Youtube amateurs do a much better job!

Now for the Blu-Ray quality.  I do not think this is HD, I think this is a DVD print converted to BD.  The colors are washed out, there is no detail, the sound is not good and the shots of Seattle (clearly chosen because of budget) looked gloomy and noisy, but not detailed.  This is not archive quality and the picture quality adds to the disappointment.  Maybe it was filmed in digital?  Whichever the case, the quality is not good, so stay far away from this!  This is not even worth seeing just to say you saw it.",1387152000,,3274,4.105511811023622

3291362,5,B0010YVCB6,"It truely was enough of a mystery-thriller to make it enjoyable. There are movies that are impossible to figure out soley do to the lack of information/clues.

3291365,4,B0010YVCB6,I like Statham because he delivers entertainment within a violent action genre. Here the plot is more twisty with Statham playing above the usual straight action man by playing an intelligent action protagonist bent on revenge. You have all the pieces laid out before you to make the twist at he end work. You won't see the end coming but you are not deprived of the clues which make it plausible and entertaining.,1379116800,,414,4.684931506849315

From start to finish this movie is spectacular. Snipes, though his role was smaller than I had originally imagined gave a great performance, and statham once again left me feeling admiration for the actor. The twist were wonderful and I felt completely satisfied in Philipe's performance too. He really did well taking the lead and investigation. I'd say if you have doubts based on the trailers or misconceptions over Snipes don't this is a great and entertaining movie. I have new respect for Snipes, Philipe  and the entire cast.

This movie seems to follow all the norms for his fare; the director and writers support the idea.  We are intrigued by the seemingly diabolical bad guy; what is he trying to do?  Why does he seem partly amused?  How is he staying ahead of the game so well?  And how can our hero die well before the end of the movie???  The constant referrals to ""chaos"" serve...what?

3291415,4,B0010YVCB6,"Just look at the three starring lead actors in Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham, and Ryan Philippe. What could possibly go wrong with a movie featuring these three in a shifting triangle? You're expecting a ""no"" here, yes? Well, no, that's a no. For an action thriller/crime drama, it succeeds on all but one level.

Snipes has little to do and plays mostly a walk-through role. That's a bit disappointing as I find him an excellent actor, but it's all part of the Big Picture of the theme of the story. Who is he? The answer depends on the which part of the story we're in. Does Snipes play a good guy or a villain?

Ryan Philippe is such a pretty boy that I am always so surprised by the intensity and high level of consummate acting and moral center he brings to each role. That pouty bottom lip also serves him well. In this role he plays Jason Statham's young, new partner and son of a hero cop killed in action. He tells the Statham character, ""I didn't understand why they thought a cop killed on the job was a hero.""

Philippe has a way of dissecting each scene and piece of evidence, much like a half-Aghan, half-pit bull would--elegant but determined. This is the third film I've seen him in and really like him as an actor.

The story is a who done it, why, and how--much much typical EXCEPT for two things that simply astonished me and caused one more star than I would have given. Jason Statham, that English actor whose accent I barely comprehend at times, admonishes one character who uses a double negative. Wow! Then this actor who spends 97% of his time-on-screen in some wild action scene, has a book on Chaos theory in his book shelf (a book of intelligent gleanings). When Philippe pulls the book out of its slot, he reads some of the highlighted sections and discovers how these random scribblings were worked into the  crime drama of the day. So how is this book with these actions found in Statham's character's house? This is another part of that Big Picture. By the way, Statham plays a cop on penalty leave for an ""unnecessary"" killing.

But where is Snipes? And who is he?

AT last the viewer discovers the truth (mais non, I will not reveal it!) and it leaves the viewer oddly dissatisfied. This turn-about ending impacts the reader, leaving him disappointed and truly surprised. But maybe, just maybe, a little pleased.",1308441600,2,2345,4.542654028436019

3291418,2,B0010YVCB6,"Sometimes I cannot believe what Hollywood gives the green light. Sure, this is just an action flick and I can lower my expectations accordingly. Still, even with lowering the bar this movie is unintentionally funny. For example, when Ryan Phillipe is asked why he became a cop, Ryan responds ""To finish what my dad started."" Seriously, that's in the movie! And there is all the wacky back-story melodrama one might expect from a high school play thrown in, overflowing even the gaudiest cliche ridden hopes of the untalented. Deserving of a full bowl of raspberries is Wesley Snipes. His goofy mugging at the camera is epic and truly hysterical. Sometimes, even when spouting the worst of dialogues, the action in an action movie displays some cause for bringing a movie to completion. Not so, here. The action is not bad, per se, but the obvious stunt doubles and quick edits away from the action reveal a level of competence that can only aspire to mediocrity. Indeed, the action is mediocre.

Saving the movie for me is Jason Statham whom I find very watchable in action roles, even if his acting is never particularly nuanced. Lastly, I could not take my eyes off of Justine Waddell!

3291421,4,B0010YVCB6,"Written and directed by Tony Giglio, Chaos (2005), is a slickly executed, gritty, crime thriller, that is somewhat reminiscent of The Usual Suspects.  Spinning several plates in the air, the film requires that you pay close attention.

A gang of criminals has taken hostages inside a bank.  Their leader Lorenz (Wesley Snipes), requests that suspended cop Quentin Conners (Jason Statham), be brought in to oversee the situation.  Conners agrees to take charge of the situation, and detective Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe), on his first day as a member of Seattle PD, is assigned as Conners' partner.  Already on the scene at the bank, are detectives Teddy Galloway (Justine Waddell), and Vincent Durano (Nicholas Lea).  Unfortunately things do not go as planned, and an explosion rocks the bank.  When the smoke clears, Lorenz and his gang are gone, but mysteriously, no cash or valuables seem to be missing.

The investigative team gets a lead to one of the gang members, which turns up a load of cash.  The money is traced to the police evidence room, but the cop who was responsible for the cash, is soon found murdered.  Connors and Dekker, get a lead to another member of the gang, a computer specialist, but as they arrive on the scene, he is killed by Lorenz.  It continues to be a busy night, as the cops get a tip, and stake out a house where Lorenz is supposed to meet some of his buddies.  But things go very sour, as the house explodes with Connors inside.

It has indeed been a very long first day for Shane Dekker, but he refuses to give up.  With the help of a police computer tech, he learns that over a billion dollars, has been stolen from the bank, via a computer virus.  He continues to unravel the mystery, discovering a lead to Lorenz's identity, and a tell-tale clue, points him to the truth.  As the new day breaks, Dekker has discovered the truth, and made sense from the chaos.

Ryan Phillippe, is excellent and very believable, in the movie's key role, as the earnest investigator, who proves himself much more capable than he may appear.  Jason Statham might be best-known for his performances in comic book type action films, but he is a very capable actor, and demonstrates that here.  Wesley Snipes has a complex role, which he executes with flash and style.  The supporting cast is solid and capable, down to the minor roles, helping to add to the film's realism.

Chaos is a very well written, nicely paced, entertaining crime thriller.  With a tight timeline, the twist and reveal, fall into place quite neatly.  It is a film that stands up well to repeated viewings.  Though not without flaws, the interesting characters, and smooth execution, makes its imperfections easy to overlook.

Bah, humbug. What a waste of time. If you have any feel for quality crime thrillers at all, you've got to laugh at this, in all the wrong ways.

Bad, hackneyed script. Wooden performances in general. Miserable direction; you can tell a bad director when every line out of everyone's mouth feels forced. This felt at nearly all times like a bad tv movie-of-the-week. I like Statham but he's wasted here and clearly needs a director with a better feel for realism. Snipes is ok and Phillippe is too, but his role is overwritten and just seems fake. I didn't buy one second of this movie.

Sure, there's a twist at the end, but when nothing that came before makes you care about the tale or the players, what's the difference? There are so many flicks of this ilk out there, and I'd recommend most of them before this insipid jello.

3291429,3,B0010YVCB6,"Director Tony Giglio says, in the 'Making Of' Special Feature for ""Chaos"", that he wanted to recapture the spirit and gritty, pre-CGI 'look' of the great 'Cop' movies of the 1970s (""The French Connection"", ""The Seven-Ups"", etc.), and technically, he succeeds, quite admirably...but the film lacks equally important factors to the earlier films' success; characters you care about, and a truly novel 'spin' to the traditional plotline. ""Chaos"" is predictable, with little character development, relying on the stars' established screen personas to carry the story, and the end result is routine, at best.

When a team of masked criminals rob a major Seattle bank, the leader (a swaggering Wesley Snipes) informs the police surrounding the bank that he wants disgraced cop Jason Statham to serve as the negotiator. Statham, who'd been involved in an earlier, fatal hostage negotiation, is pulled off suspension, teamed up with brilliant young detective Ryan Phillippe, and attempts to resolve the situation...but things fall apart, explosively, and the gang escapes in the fire and smoke. As the press again berates Statham, Phillippe begins putting the pieces together, revealing a far more complex scheme than a simple robbery...leading to a 'surprising' climactic revelation (which you'll figure out long before he does!)

The film isn't terrible (there's one really good chase, early in the film), but as you've likely seen all this before, it isn't terribly involving, either. Phillippe takes the acting honors, Statham gets in a few good one-liners (but less of his 'signature' physical action than his fans may like), and Snipes mugs his way through another 'villainous' role.

3291433,2,B0010YVCB6,"After watching this film, I exited the theatre (this title was just released in Korean theaters) and hit shuffle on my iPod, which currently has a little over 8000 songs on it.  The first song to pop up was ""Chaos"" by U.N.K.L.E. off of their album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Psyence-Fiction/dp/B00000AFK4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Psyence Fiction</a>.  No fooling.  Aside from the fact that it was an extraordinary coincidence, I also mention this because it was the most entertaining part of my movie-going experience, and it happened after the flick was over.

The song is only okay, but it's certainly better than the film, a tepid ""action"" movie that claims to have a story built on the Chaos Theory once made so famous by Jeff Goldblum's character from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jurassic-Park/dp/B00003CXAT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jurassic Park</a>.  The idea is that chaos is never truly random, and that in even the most cluttered of incidents, patterns emerge.

The theory is debatable, especially if this movie is meant to be one of its proponents.  After some exposition-heavy credits, several somber looking bank robbers (led by Wesley Snipes) take over a major branch of American Global in Seattle.  When hostage negotiations begin, the bad guys demand that disgraced officer Conners (Statham) be given the helm.  Unfortunately, as soon as he's put in charge, things go sideways.

Aiding Conners is a newly appointed detective played by Ryan Phillipe, who refuses to act in every scene, relying almost exclusively on this pouty, petulant look he can do with his poofy lips.  Phillipe's character begins to steadily assemble the clues, sorting through the baffling array of red herrings to some supposed truth about chaos that the bad guys may or may not be trying to prove.  Scattered about the meandering script are a few lukewarm ""action"" sequences (including one of the dullest vehicle chases I've seen in a long while) and lots and lots of cringe-worthy dialogue.  In fact, when one of the officers announces that ""he wasn't just a better cop than you; he was also a better man,"" I suddenly realized I was watching a bad movie.

In addition to all of this, there are stupid emotional back stories, unbelievable twists of misdirection, and even some insulting flashbacks as Phillipe puzzles it all out, in case the audience still doesn't get it.  Chaos, as a condition, can have its crafty corners and intriguing entanglements.  It can, in its own way, be beautiful.  In fact, of all the adjectives I think of when chaos comes to mind, ""boring"" is none of them, which makes me think this film is seriously misnamed.",1238284800,6,2732,5.390588235294118

There is none for this movie, since the plot was so involved that any attempt to summarize it would violate the spirit of brevity of a Short Attention Span Summary.

The writers did a great job in keeping this plot from becoming hackneyed with so much misdirection.

Example: The man who was shot at the beginning was a black man-- and so we assumed that Wesley Snipes character was going to be playing the Vengeful Relative's role. As it turns out, this was not true.

Example: Jason Stataham's character we initially thought was the good guy, but it turns out that he was the bad guy.

The acting was good and Wesley Snipes was so obnoxious that it seemed that he had a genetic gift for playing such roles.

This was a good investment, and would have been worth an evening movie ticket.",1234483200,,819,4.537414965986395
3291436,5,B0010YVCB6,Jason Statham & wesley Snipes are awesome in this action mysery movie. this is such a good film. if you watch this movie you'll have to pay close attention. this movie rocks. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1226102400,,230,4.25

In fact it seems to drag when one of the main characters is killed off and you will figure they aren't really dead and you of course are right. At first you may think they are playing possum to catch the bad guy or you may figure they are in cahoots with the bad guy since they survived. I am not saying I didn't watch three quarters of the movie because it has reasonably good acting. What I am saying is it is as though they dropped the ball and you will feel like you were cheated out of good ending. It feels like they took several other action movies and threw them together. I suggest as a rental, but not to purchase until after you see it. Good quality DVD, mediocre replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Inside Man"" and ""The Italian Job"", both far superior movies. - C. Luster",1218240000,2,885,4.242603550295858
3291439,2,B0010YVCB6,"Ok, wesley snipes has done some pretty bad movies lately including this one, but what on earth was Jason Statham doing in this terrible film? even he couldn't save this disaster. This movie is very slow paced and lacks action, It is more of a crime drama than an action movie but even the drama lacked suspense and mystery and i literaly had to force myself to keep watching the movie because i felt bored and uninterested.

This movie has an average star rating of almost 4 starts, don't fall for the hype!, if you want to see a good recent crime drama movie go watch jean-claude van-damme's ""until death"", Its a much better movie.",1215993600,9,632,4.495652173913044
3291440,3,B0010YVCB6,"Tony Giglio directed ""In Enemy Hands.""  I haven't seen it.  In the DVD extras, he said he wanted to make a film that was like ""The French Connection,"" a homage to 70s action films that had great car chases, entertaining while made for a relatively low budget.  He accomplished his goal.  ""Chaos"" doesn't challenge you in any emotional way.  It's more of a mystery than an action film, trying to figure out who done it.

Jason Statham is now a major action star.  I also watched him this weekend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revolver/dp/B0011VIO3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revolver</a>.  This film won't make me forget ""The Transporter"" which I liked because of its blend of action and romance.  There really isn't that much romance going on in this film.  Statham is about like he is in the other films I've seen, always interesting, but not that different.

Ryan Phillippe plays Detective Shane Dekker.  Phillippe was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breach-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000OYAT3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breach (Widescreen Edition)</a>, the Academy Award winning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000A3XY5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gosford-Park/dp/B00005JKNF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gosford Park</a>.  His intensity is impressive.  There's one scene where he listening to another person on the phone who gets important information.  He slams his hand down on the desk and yells, ""Yes!""  I thought, ""Now, that's over the top"" & rewound it, but he actually looks pretty good.  He appears pretty banged up and leaves blood on the side of his head between locations.  One imagines that they were short of towels and water in Seattle.

Wesley Snipes won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival for ""One Night Stand"" in 1997.  He does a good job in this picture, but most likely won't be picking up a statue.  I liked his wisecracking on the phone from the bank, only to hear the altered voice sound like a garbled monotone.  In the DVD extras, he said he didn't want his fight scenes to look like ""Blade.""  I think he did that.

Henry Czerny from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Pink-Panther-Special-Edition/dp/B000FBH3V8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Pink Panther (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ice-Storm/dp/B000056BSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ice Storm</a>&nbsp;does a good job as the thickheaded Captain Martin Jenkins.  He's so incredibly shortsighted that one wonders how he got to be the leader.

Justine Waddell who starred in TV's ""The Mystery of Natalie Wood"" plays Detective Teddy Balloway.  She's having an affair with the captain and used to sleep with Statham's Quentin Conner.  She's a pretty confused girl as far as relationships, and wouldn't you know that she didn't turn off her cell phone?!?

Ty Olsson who I've been watching as Sam on TV's ""Men In Trees,"" plays the bad guy who winds up in the hospital.  He does a good job of being very different, making me stretch to connect him with television.  There's also a small part done well by the bank manager Rob LaBelle who has appeared in many television series like ""The 4400"" & ""The Dead Zone.""

""Chaos"" is not the most original of films, nor does it intend to be.  It's an interesting evening's entertainment.  I saw it at a sidewalk sale, which prompted me renting it.  I didn't go back to the sidewalk.  But I liked it well enough.  Enjoy!",1215388800,,3743,6.087954110898662

3291442,1,B0010YVCB6,"I'm a Jason Statham fan, and have enjoyed most of his movies, but this cinematic abortion is so horrible I'm in shock that not only was Jason Statham invovled in it, but Wesley Snipes, and Ryan Phillippe as well. I'll start it off with the good stuff. The story was good and it had a lot of twists. Some of the ones that needed to be good were but, most were predictable... That's it. The acting was dead pan through out the cast except for the news reporter at the start of the movie who seemed to be the only person who was trying. It probably had a lot to do with the abismal script.

The writers don't seem to have ever learned the word subtle because all they do is beat you over the head with ""hints"" and things that will be important later. It's like a crappy magician saying look over there to do their magic verses one who uses subtle misdirection to pull it off. In addition to that the writers don't know how to write women at all. There's a scene where a female character trhows herslef at Ryan Phillippe after having just met him in a way that would have gotten her fired from any job except phone sex operator, and as my wife pointed out, he's not hot enough for most girls to do that. Sorry Ryan. Also any writer that is so dumb they use the phrase ""it's not rocket surgery."" as a serious statement and not a joke needs to be beaten with a lead pipe. While being the most hillarious moment in the moviethe dead pan acting makes it seem as though it was a serious statement.

Another personal beef I have with this movie is that Jason Statham's character who is from the nort west hates the Pac 10 and thinks it's over rated. You don't EVER hear someone in the NW say that about the Pac 10. We're very loyal to our schools and the only place I've ever heard something like that is from other conferences that get butt hurt that the Pac 10 consistantly has teams in the top 25. While we're on the subject of the North West, lets talk about the amazing stock footage they used for the city too. So it's set in Seattle, but they don't use stock footage of Seattle. Not once. On top of that it's got that grainy VHS look like they taped it off a movie on HBO in the 80s and were saving it for a special occasion. Also for an action movie it didn't have very much action, and when it was present the fighting was poorly coreographed.
The fight scene where they break a mirror in a bathroom you can see the guy getting thrown into the mirror look over his shoulder to make sure he's lined up right, also you can see that the mirror is already broken from a previous attempt. I'm not one of those guys who freeze frames his way through movies, the mistakes were that glaring. This is hands down the worst movei I've ever seen. Go watch the transporter, or crank, or any of his other movies, but skip this attrocity.",1211500800,10,2822,4.214417744916821

There are twists,  some that aren't super surprising, but it does keep you guessing throughout the movie was to who the evil mastermind is.  The car chase in the middle of the movie with Ryan Phillipe was garbage though, it detracts from an otherwise smart movie with a very 1980's CHIPs style impossible fake car chase.

3291451,4,B0010YVCB6,"According to one reference source, 'The name ""chaos theory"" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data.', and to enjoy the ride in this action film, understanding the chaos theory is helpful if not essential. In writing and directing CHAOS, Tony Giglio (as he explains in one of the featurettes on the DVD) worked to make an action movie that was more than just pyrotechnics and killing (though those are in abundance in this film!), and instead return to the atmosphere of older 'French Connection' type crime dramas.  To accomplish this he uses the chaos theory to create just enough twists to keep the audience surprised.  If the film doesn't open new doors for the genre, it certainly supplies enough entertainment to make it worth watching.

The film opens on a bridge in Seattle where an incident involving  detective Quentin Connors (Jason Statham) and another unidentified detective results in Connors being dismissed from the police force. A sophisticated bank heist ensues and the head of the heist is one Lorenz (Wesley Snipes) who, when surrounded by the police after an explosion jolts the neighborhood, demands to negotiate the hostages situation with Connors: Captain Jenkins (Henry Czerny) and a new police recruit Detective Shane Dekker (Ryan Phillippe) recruit the reluctant, fired Connors to return to Seattle to take charge - with Dekker as his partner.  From this point on the story is a mlange of mind-bending assaults on the back using the chaos theory to trace the elements of discovery.  Just when the audience is comfortable with knowing the good guys from the bad guys, the chessboard turns and surprises occur that leave the story with a sense of incomplete thought on the part of the script, but also an appreciation for the degree of suspense the story has presented.

The strong character in the film is Ryan Phillippe who is able to hold his own with the practiced action hero antics of Statham and Snipes.  There are some standout cameos, such as Keegan Connor Tracy who has one of the more sensually seductive roles on film, Henry Czerny as the forceful super chief, and Justine Waddell and Nicholas Lea as the detectives who shoulder the only truth in the tale. Not a great action movie but one with a modicum of intelligence that makes is rise above the many others in this category.  Grady Harp, February 08",1203984000,28,2479,4.925659472422062
