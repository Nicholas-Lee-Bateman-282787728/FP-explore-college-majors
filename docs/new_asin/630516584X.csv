1004311,2,630516584X,"WARNING: SPOILERS, although this movie is its own worst spoiler.
The makers of this film had a good thing going, if only they'd suspected it and dared be a bit ambiguous as to whether their motives were politically correct or not. But guess they were committed all along to making a different film than the good one this could've been. Kevin Bacon plays Martin Thiel, a disturbed young man who was traumatized by learning that his mother wanted to abort him. Considering that, even the staunchest pro-choice advocates might ought to cut him some slack if he's not firmly in their camp. As the movie goes on we see perhaps even more compelling reasons why he's traumatized. Quite apart form her intentions in his prenatal days, we see that his mother is one who would make Susan Smith seem warm and caring by comparison. The movie (unwittingly, I suppose) creates considerable sympathy for Martin. But never mind all that. This movie is firmly committed to by-the-books political correctness. Because Martin is an abortion opponent and his mother is a doctor who performs abortions, don't imagine any room for suspense here as to who must be the villain and who must be his last victim. When some of his mother's former patients show up murdered and mutilated, Martin becomes the chief suspect. At one point (somewhere around halfway through) he seems to virtually confess to his lawyer (played by Gary Oldman) that he's the killer, hinting that he carries out a sort of divine justice against those who got abortions. Unquestionably here's a disturbed guy. But wouldn't a smart suspenseful plot development from that point be the following? Martin is no killer, but in his traumatized state almost admires whoever is and almost wants to take credit for those deeds and/or protect the real killer. Meanwhile his ice queen mother is a most conflicted pshcyopath, not at all totally secure in her belief in the morality of abortion but keeps providing them to have access to knowledge of who gets them, so she can exact her ""vengeance"" on them. But that would mean the movie would have to settle for being ambivalent on the subject of abortion. Its makers lacked the imagination and/or courage (probably both) to make that intriguing thriller. Instead what they do make from the point of Martin's virtual confession is as morose and boring as it is predictable.",1022371200,5,2358,4.882793017456359
1004312,2,630516584X,"A pompous and predictable thriller that covers all-too-familiar territory, this one is about a lawyer who helps set his client free of murder charges only to find out he was guilty of that crime and of another killing. Those who prefer smart thrillers will be disappointed, but with its occassional moments of intriguing suspense and credible performances by Oldman and Bacon, it's hard to look away.",981676800,9,400,5.075757575757576

1004404,1,630516584X,"Oddly enough, the only believable characters in this mess-turd-piece are the supporting actors.  Gary and Kevin are both out of place and both seem lost and have fallen back on ""acting"", which is never a good thing.  That said, you really don't have anyone to root for or against here, which is what you need to make this sort of movie work.  It's horribly dated with the fashion and hair styles, and the legal and court and forensic jargon and usage wouldn't stand up in a movie of the week. Keep your money, I want my time back.",1507334400,,530,4.387755102040816
1004405,4,630516584X,"A very good film. Oldman, and Bacon both turn in outstanding performances. It is dated, but the story holds up. Interesting to think how far we've come with DNA, and forensic evidence - this story couldn't be made today. Well it could be made, but there is no way Bacon's psychotic killer character would have walked away from a murder wrap by discrediting an eye- witness. Regardless of how the killer burned or washed the bodies - they would find the DNA evidence necessary to put this guy away the first time.

It is a great suspenseful film with the cat and mouse between the two leads, Oldman and Bacon, very well scripted, and acted. Definitely not a waste of time. I have to wonder if all the CSI shows are the reason for some of the low ratings. This film was made in 89 - there weren't even cell phones - forget any of that CSI voodoo. Watch and enjoy an old time suspense thriller.",1505260800,,891,4.367469879518072

Gary Oldman is a demi-god of the the modern screen. Kevin Bacon is seven degrees from a demi-god in any given movie. Even these two couldn't breath life into this horrific excuse of a script. Turn back now while you still can.",1502841600,,375,4.194444444444445
1004472,3,630516584X,"Old film, 1995, thatvtakes place in Boston but caught my interest. However, it turned out to be a real dud.

Attorney Ben Chase, played by Gary Oldman, as a young stud who successfully defends Martin Thiel, played by Kevin Bacon. Martin is a wealthy, playboy, and getting him acquitted of a series of brutal murders was his first real success. However, Chase later finds out  that Thiel is indeed a serial killer. Since Thiel cannot be tried again for his crimes, Chase tries to get him to incriminate himself before he can kill again.  Easier said than done.

The rest of the cast is good, but not good enough to save this film.

Listen, the first thing I noticed in this movie was Gary Oldman's 1980s curled coif that just screams AMBITION. Kevin Bacon is in this thing, too, and he Doesn't disappoint. His eyes are as cold as a slitherin snake's, and he just embodies INTENSENESS. I loved all the scenes of Gary Oldman's car pulling into different parking spaces then backing out, his car driving over a bridge, his car backing up, and then parking. This movie even had overhead shots of his car parking. You won't see that in a Burt Reynold's movie! Also, the scene where he just runs through a rainy park for a good 5 minutes yelling for Kevin Bacon's ass, and (spoiler) he trips over a dead woman's body and then her body rolls down the hill and lands on him. Guys, you're really missing out if you don't check out this movie. Just tell me how it ends. Also, Matthew McConaughey (Fool's Gold) could have played Both of these roles back to back.

1005934,2,630516584X,"Paul Bernardo wasn't a nice guy.  Now we know that he didn't have very good taste, either.

Mr. Bernardo liked this film so much, he even changed his last name to ""Teale,"" a slight variation on the name of the Kevin Bacon character in ""Criminal Law.""  I just read the book ""Invisible Darkness"" by Stephen Williams -- a slightly biased but excellent read by a very good crime writer -- and in that book, Mr. Williams described how this film was Mr. Bernardo's -- or is that Mr. Teale's? -- favorite film.  If you know anything about Mr. Bernardo, you might say, ""Not surprising.""

Now, the cast in this film is top notch.  I am a Kevin Bacon fan -- I believe that he has done some excellent work throughout his career -- and Gary Oldman gave a performance of a lifetime in ""Dracula,"" even though Keanu Reeves did his best to pull him down.  (I'm teasing a bit.  Mr. Reeves wasn't half bad in that film.)  But the female lead and female supporting actors here?  I thought they were fine with what they had to work with, but I can't remember seeing them ever in anything else.

The problem with ""Criminal Law"":  well OK; there are not just a few.  But for me, there was way too much exposition, particularly by the Kevin Bacon character just before he was going to do something nasty.  In my opinion, if you were a serial killer, you probably wouldn't have too much time for chit chat in most scenarios, since, well, your ""prey"" would be fighting back.  That prey wouldn't just be standing there listening to you ramble, as if you were accepting an Academy Award nomination, a nomination that surely no one in this borderline film ever received.

To Mr. Bacon and Mr. Oldman I say:  ""Don't take it too hard.  After all, I'm not a professional film critic.  Not only that, you both have done fine work in your careers, so just let this one go.""  To Mr. Bernardo I say:  ""Keep your day job, which would probably be banging your head against the wall in a 6 foot by 10 foot cell in solitary.

Infamous Canadian Schoolgirl Killer Paul Bernardo was obsessed with this film  and with Kevin Bacon's twisted character Martin Thiel. Mr Bernardo even changed his last named to ""Teale"" shortly before his 1993 arrest, in a bizarre nod to this mediocre film. Gary Oldman plays hot-shot Ben Chase, an Attorney who manages to get Thiel aquitted of murder charges more than once. Thiel, a preppy son-of-an-Abortionist, loves his clothes, boats, and doing creative things with flaming diapers. Tess Harper, Joe Don Baker, and Sean McCann play the cops in earnest, but this is Oldman and Bacon's show. Neither is especially successful here: Oldman, with a bad 80's haircut, is wild-eyed and soaking wet for most of the film and Bacon lacks the depth to play his role.

1005975,3,630516584X,"Both Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon are superb in this thriller set in Boston.  In both the courtroom and in the darkness of the depravity of the mind, this tense drama plays out to a powerful conclusion.

Oldman plays Ben Chase, a young attorney bouyed by his early successes who defends Martin Thiel, accused of murder.  Chase realizes that Thiel not only is guilty, but has not given up his murderous ways; in fact, he is a serial killer.

The plot is pretty simple; Chase realizes that he has unleased a killer whose mind has been unhinged by his mother's decision to abort him as a developing baby.  What does an ethical man do when he knows someone has used him in a horrific way?

Tess Harper does her fine usual job (and looks good doing it) as detective Stillwell, and Joe Don Baker (detective Mesel) is good playing the character he usually plays, a gruff but effective supporting character.

The true interest in the film is the main character's acting.  The staging is well done, the cinematography is fine.  The final scene illustrates the fact that there is often little separating the law from the crime.  Perhaps we are all capable of acting on our more base impulses. There are a few plot holes (such as, where are the bailiffs and the police in the climatic courthouse scene).  But over-all, it's a fine movie.

Kevin Bacon is OK as the twisted son of a mother who does threapeutic abortions (pro- lifers this is not an arguement pro or con just a description of the character his mother portrays).

Seeing how this is not available on DVD, and not even being sold by outside sellers tells me that they may never have released it on this format.  That, based on my memory of the quality of the Laser Disc release, does not surprise me in the least.

I had this movie on Laser Disc purchased for me by an ex-girlfriend, and definitely shows to me her lack of fortitude in choosing movies based on their quality.  But, who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth.

I thought this was the most asinine movie.  It was schlock full of loose strings, un-explaineable (though the tried) plot twists, and complete lack of plot logic. I thought a defense lawyer was supposed to defend you?  Right?  And I thought that all lawyers sign an ethics agreement to support and treat the client with all due respect.  Maybe I'm not using the right terms, but what the hell!

Gary Oldman is a defense lawyer, and defends and gets a defendant off (Kevin Bacon) and supposedly, figures out Kevin is actually guilty of the former and a new crime, and suddenly becomes the defender of justice.  Maybe somebody better tell the screenplay writer, that defense lawyers defend the ""guilty"" and do not work for the State Prosecuter's Office, or even the Public Defender's office.  If he accepts the case, and then acts as the Detective, he is immediately guilty of injustice to his client, and the viewer will immediately turn off.

However, for some reasons, I didn't turn it off.  I was immediately fascinated by the absurdity of this plot.  And the overacting.  And the stupidity!  Gary Oldman and the Lady Detective deserve the Overacting Raspberry award of the year!  Their on screen interactions were ludicrous and hilarious at the same time!

Another reviewer mentioned that Gary Oldman has an American accent.  I actually didn't know he was British when I first saw this movie, and fascinated with how well he could imitate a British accent in his other movies.  Of course, I have since learned his country of origin, and am equally impressed with his American and British accents in many of his films.  He truly is a glorious actor.

Even in this movie, he steals most of his scenes, and deserves credit for his wonderful acting.  But the movie is awful, and not even he can save it!

If you want to laugh, try to find this on VHS, or even Laser Disc (I still have my copy) but DVD format seems to be up in the air at this time.  But under no circumstances pay more than $1.25 for this tripe!

The script plods through what could have been an interesting storyline. I got about 1/3 the way into it until my jaw hurt so bad from gritting my teeth as I was enduring it that I had to stop. The production is just a notch or two up from a high school play - lighting, costumes, hair, makeup, editing & so on. I can watch just about anything, but this, this was beyond my capabilities.",1523491200,,531,4.165048543689321
7886766,5,630516584X,"Very suspenseful old school crime story line with the extra twist being the psychological  ""bridge"" built by killer between himself and his attorney. I've aways loved Kevin Bacon and his and Gary Oldman's performances didn't disappoint.  Interesting house and park images gave this an ""film noir"" feel, as well.",1522281600,,311,5.326530612244898

7886772,5,630516584X,"I never watch a movie without doing something else on the side; I play a simple game, look at my email, write lists, talk to my children or husband, give directions, etc., etc...but, though I tried, I could not be distracted from this movie.  I thought it was great!",1509235200,,266,4.428571428571429
