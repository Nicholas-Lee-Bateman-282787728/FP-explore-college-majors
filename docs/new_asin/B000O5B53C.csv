8183059,5,B000O5B53C,"The nice thing about this Spanish version is that it is not just a dubbed work.  They kept the melodies of the English songs and rewrote the lyrics in Spanish to fit!  It's so nice to see a Spanish language work so well done.  They even wrote a version of the theme song in Spanish.  Overall, this is a clever combination of Joseph, his dreamcoat and Bonanza.",1321660800,,359,4.313432835820896
