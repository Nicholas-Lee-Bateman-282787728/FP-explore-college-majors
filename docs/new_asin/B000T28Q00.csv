2892448,5,B000T28Q00,"This is not a biography of Byron's life, or any kind of documentary. It is a very powerful portrayal of Byron's personality and, possibly, of how life felt to him. Although some details are incorrect and there are important omissions (notably, Byron's stay at the Villa Diodati with the Shelley menage), it is a noteworthy film.",1195516800,29,328,4.875

2892503,5,B000T28Q00,This film made me want to know more about Byron. I did research him and found that he was a brilliant but torched soul. Jonny Lee Miller is a compelling actor and I felt that he represented Byron magnificently. Loved the movie and plan to watch again & again.,1380672000,,259,4.3061224489795915

2892506,1,B000T28Q00,"The movie had too much explicit sex scenes that seemed to consume the movie. The message of the life of Lord Byron could been presented without such scenes. My conclusion is Lord Byron was a man who did not possess real freedom. He was a prisoner of his own uncontrollable passions. He is presented as a sad, unhappy and lonely man without real moral substance.",1346198400,3,361,4.569230769230769
2892507,2,B000T28Q00,"For a film dealing with a reputedly scandalous life, the BBC telepic about Lord Byron is curiously dull. Jonny Lee Miller in the title role provides no depth at all to the character. Whether this is a consequence of a poorly written script of the actor's limitations is hard to say - probably a combination of the two. The film provides no insight into Byron's inspiration. For example, the film opens with a short prologue in Greece, where he has spent the two years. He returns to England and voila - we have Childe Harold's Pilgrimmage. His liaisons with a number of women are mostly shown as individual disconnected scenes that don't fit particularly well together within the overall narrative (the exception being the portrayal of his affair with his half-sister). In short, the series fails to illuminate Byron as either poet or womanizer. So all that is left is the usual sumptuously shot (although often too dark), decorated, and costumed BBC period piece without any substance.",1341273600,4,986,4.910179640718563

2892509,4,B000T28Q00,"This is not meant to be a biography as it does contain several gaps, notably the period in Switzerland that it skips over entirely. Perhaps the filmmakers thought this period had been covered enough, but with the current vampire craze, I was actually looking forward to this period which led to Polidori's ""The Vampyre."" Lord Byron was such an iconic figure I was looking very forward to getting a visual glimpse and couldn't imagine who could pull it off.

As others have said, the only thing detracting is that it could have been longer. Lord Byron did so much to cram it all into two segments seems just wrong. I would have liked to have seen them cover the Chaworth infatuation, more of the Grand Tour, and most definitely explore the dynamics with the Shelleys, as well as capture the period with Contessa Guiccoli, his final and longest relationship, as well as the woman who helped rear his daughter Allegra, who got about two minutes in the film.

Jonny Lee Miller did an absolutely remarkable job trying to fill these great shoes, so much so that I'm looking into more of his work. I've seen a couple of other films and Miller really did set the bar. For anyone who wants to learn about Byron, I would suggest reading some of the biographies before watching this, just to have the full picture of his life, but would recommend this film!",1297468800,3,1346,4.604166666666667
2892510,5,B000T28Q00,I bought this film and really enjoyed it. Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of Byron is brilliant. I highly recommend this BBC production to fans of Jane Austen and fans of Regency historical romance.,1294185600,2,195,4.9393939393939394
2892511,4,B000T28Q00,"This film about the literary world's first superstar bad-boy has much going for it. Lord Byron was the highly talented writer and poet who shocked the world with his bisexuality, his multiple affairs with the powerful elite married women of England, his incestuous affair with his half sister Augusta Lee, his scandalous divorce where his wife reveals sexual practices that were capital crimes in England, his affair with the sister-in-law of the poet Shelley, and his charge into the Greco-Turkish war. He was notorious in his day and his legend lives on. This film does a credible job of capturing much of the self-induced chaos and impulsive madness that drove Byron into disaster after disaster. Yet he survives many scandals and survives due to his extreme beauty and literary gifts. Lord Byron is played by Jonny Lee Miller who does a credible job of capturing the romantic madness that propels Byron from mishap to mishap. Lord Byron was served throughout his life by a servant Fletcher, played by Philip Glenister. Fletcher suffers through many misadventures as Byron's fortunes go up and down, but mostly down, and sacrifices his own personal life to serve Byron. Byron was very lucky to have totally loyal friends such as John Cam Hobhouse, played by Stephen Campbell Moore. Hobhouse, or `Hobbie' as he was called by Byron was his loyal school friend who knew of Byron's love affairs with young men during his youth, his wild sexual life with women - including his half sister, and his immense talents. Hobbie burns Byron's Memoirs after Byron's death, an act that he may have committed to protect Byron but would certainly have been an amazing piece of literature if it had survived.

Possibly the most scandalous aspect of Byron's life is his affair with his half-sister Augusta Lee. Lee is played to perfection by the warm beauty, Natasha Little. Byron rationalized the affair since he and Augusta were never reared together an met when they were older, but once the affair became public, he and Augusta were considered scandalous.

Byron's confidant, the immensely wealthy Lady Melbourne, played perfectly by Vanessa Redgrave, is his defender until even Byron goes too far for her to stomach. Camilla Power plays the outlandish Lady Caroline Lamb, daughter-in-law to Lady Melbourne, who falls so in love with Byron that he becomes her obsession and she makes public scene after scene until she finally is able to covert her obsession into pure hatred. Once scorned, she now uses her hatred of Bryon to plot his downfall. Of course Byron gives to every enemy ample ammunition for his wild life reads like an open book.

Percy Bysshe Shelley, played by Oliver Dimsdale and his wife Mary, played by Sally Hawkins, don't play a major role in this film. However the drowning death of Shelley and his cremation on the beach are captured in the story. Byron was approached by Mary Goodwin Shelley's half sister, Claire Clairmont, and had an affair that produced a girl child. Byron and Claire's erotic flame soon cooled but Byron was able to keep the child and sent her to an Italian convent for her education.

Byron's marriage to Annabelle Milbanke, played by Julie Cox, is a highlight of the film. Byron was advised by his sister Augusta to find a respectable wife as a distraction from their incestuous affair and hopefully as a stabilizing force in his life. The marriage to a pious intelligent rich young woman was a disaster of the first order, and the film leaves no doubt that the failure of the marriage was fully the responsibility of Byron. Byron ignored his wife, belittled her, spent her money, and had affairs with other women.

The film is an excellent introduction to Byron but even in a film that is longer than 2 hours much was cut out. Byron's young love affair with John Edleston is never mentioned. Byron's last male lover in Greece is also never mentioned in the film. Thus his bisexuality is only briefly displayed at the beginning of the film. We are also never sure of the relationship between Byron and Shelley. Byron's affair with Claire Clairmont was a brief sexual fling but a continued struggle afterward for the affairs and supervision of their child. This was never developed in the film. Branka Katic plays Italian Countess Teresa Guicioli, the last female lover. She was a highly intelligent and sophisticated woman but the film rushes through his lengthy affair with Teresa.

However the end of the film where Byron is bled to death by incompetent physicians in Greece is vividly captured. The film is highly entertaining and the only reason I do not give it 5 stars is that I am familiar with Byron's life and thus aware of what passages were edited out to crowd a wild adventurous life into a single movie.",1291161600,7,4751,4.8520345252774355
2892542,5,B000T28Q00,"WELL DONE, AS PORTRAYED BY JONNY LEE MILLER. NOW TO CHECK OUT ""CHILDE HAROLD"" FROM THE LIBRARY TO SEE WHAT THE FUSS IS ABOUT!",1267142400,,125,4.25
2892543,4,B000T28Q00,"After watching Jonny Lee Miller's excellent portrayal of Mr. Knightley in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Emma-2009/dp/B002XTBE6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Emma (2009)</a>, I looked up his body of work, and came across this production. I have to say this is a beautifully-filmed story of Byron, and Miller is amazing in the title role. He delivers a finely nuanced performance, and with his matching good looks, embodies Byron perfectly. After two years in Greece, Byron returns to England in 1811, disappointed that his lack of fortune has necessitated his return. Upon his mother's death, he returns to his ancestral home and finds himself attaining fame as a writer, though he is still deeply in debt. This story focuses on three romantic interests (well one not so romantic) of Byron's. There's the wild aristocratic child-woman Lady Caroline Lamb (Camilla Power) who initially arouses Byron's interest and ardor but who soon grows obsessed with him causing him to lose interest. Then there's the secret love of Byron's life - his half-sister Augusta Leigh (Natasha Little in an incredibly compelling performance), the only woman whom Byron feels he can truly love without inhibitions. Unfortunately, this is a relationship that is doomed from the beginning, given its' taboo and illicit nature. Out of desperation (given his dire financial straits) and Augusta's insistence, Byron proposes marriage to an heiress, Annabella Milbanke (Julie Cox), a woman determined to change Byron and 'cure' his corrupted nature through discovering God. Predictably enough, this marriage suffocates Byron and is also doomed.

Percy Bysshe Shelley is also introduced in this production, though Oliver Dimsdale's portrayal seems rather lackluster. The supporting cast do a commendable job, such as the butler William Fletcher (Philip Glenister), Byron's aristocratic confidante, Lady Melbourne (Vanessa Redgrave), and many more (including Sally Hawkins as Mary Shelley, recently seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Persuasion/dp/B000YIGNKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Persuasion</a>). The major flaw of this production is the lack of sufficient time to truly explore the various facets of Byron's character such as his maturation as a poet. Some of the major events of his life are left out, the most glaring being the summer he spent with the Shelley's. There's also not much time spent on exploring his affair with a young Contessa (played by Branka Katic, recently seen in ""Big Love"")It almost seems like a hurried production ,especially the second half. It is best to read about Lord Byron before actually watching this so that one can mentally fill in the gaps (otherwise it gets rather muddled), and I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Byron-in-Love-A-Short-Daring-Life/dp/0393070115/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Byron in Love: A Short Daring Life</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Byron-Child-of-Passion-Fool-of-Fame-Vintage/dp/0679740856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Byron: Child of Passion, Fool of Fame (Vintage)</a>.

2892545,4,B000T28Q00,"Byron was a pitiful excuse for a human being.  Thank God he chose to write poetry--leaving some redemptive spirit behind.  Luckily his poetry is controlled enough to read, unlike his personal life.  A good film if one wants to learn something about Byron without having to wade through tomes of researchers who either attempt to emmulate him or denigrate him.",1250812800,,359,4.95

I would have liked to see more about his writing process. And, of course, his relationship with Shelley. Not terrible though, I thought the casting of Miller was perfect.",1249603200,,309,4.636363636363637
2892547,1,B000T28Q00,"We picked this up and watched it last weekend.  What a complete disappointment.  We should have realized what it was going to be like when very near the beginning the actors talked about how Byron had swam the Hellispont, not showing it.  The point is, of course, this is a movie.  I should move.  It should not be people talking about what had happend in the past.

It went on like that for most of the whole movie nothing really happening on screen, but people talking about what had happened off screen (except for a few mildly [and I do mean mildly] eroitic sceens.  Shelly dies off screen, Byron's one daughter dies off screen, the entire lake Geneva summer never happens in the movie.

We ended up watching the movie to the bitter end, just because we couldn't believe that it could possibly continue as badly as it had started out.

It could.",1245369600,11,849,4.496732026143791
2892548,3,B000T28Q00,"Lavish, lovely-to-look at, perfectly cast all-around with people who look very much like their historic counterparts and play their roles flawlessly (except for Shelley), magnificently scored, with a wonderfully nuanced performance by Jonny Lee Miller in the title role, atmospheric, authentic in detail....this BBC Production had everything going for it - except for Time.  If only there were an extra hour to cover the sorely overlooked Byronic summer with the Shelley party....and to probe a bit more thoroughly the poetical side of Byron...his relationship with his Last Attachment....his involvement in both Italian and Greek rebellion...the incredible impact of his death on the British conscience...if only...if only instead of Two Parts, this production had been done in Three(or more actually)! This film had EVERYTHING going for it - except Time. The first part is leisurely; the second seems hurried.  One other matter: If no one knows of Byron's life, the film will most likely be somewhat confusing.  For students of Byron, the film is rich in detail, both period and personal - even down to his nail-biting!  Despite its flaws (basically it not being long enough) this is a wonderful look into the life of the man who was ""mad, bad and dangerous to know.""  Highly recommended!  And the score should be on CD!!!",1204243200,41,1324,5.192488262910798

8207351,1,B000T28Q00,"This was a bad script and just focused on the usual myths and old rumours about Byron. Miller had none of the charisma that Byron was supposed to have which reputedly enslaved many. Trite in every way.
Also the research for the script was very poor and showed a scant knowledge of the times and often of Byron himself -- such as Byron talking about Jane Austen's books, replying to a character who says some female is looking for a husband - ""Can't she find one in Austen""
Yet Jane Austen's name was not known to the public in her lifetime (Or Byron's) as all her books were published as ""Written by A Lady"".
Byron has to be the most unfairly maligned man in history, and this film goes a long way to enforce that, shame on them.",1436486400,2,729,4.2898550724637685
