8274239,1,B0019KAQAY,"The History Channel strikes again!  An interesting program, with fascinating historical details and wonderful archival footage, is completely destroyed by their practice of not re-editing TV shows for DVD release.  ""But why would they do that?"" you ask plaintively.  Well, I'll tell you.  You may have noticed that when you watch these shows on TV, the segments are separated by commercials, and each segment ends with ""coming up: [previews of all the good stuff]"" and, except for the first segment, each one begins with ""previously on this show ..."" showing what you've JUST WATCHED because there wasn't even a commercial in between.  Toward the end of the presentation, where the commercials were apparently getting very close together, this becomes almost unwatchable, as you're watching film clips you've already seen six or seven times, mixed in with the tiny bit of new material they can sandwich in between the ""previously seen"" and ""next up"" garbage.  It is JUST PLAIN AWFUL.  How they could take something so intriguing and make it so boring and disheveled is beyond me, but they manage, every time.  Beware of History Channel documentaries, in general!",1228694400,2,1162,5.1436170212765955
