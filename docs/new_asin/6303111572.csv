562421,3,6303111572,"If you're an Agatha Christie fan, this is probably one for the library. If you appreciate Joan Hickson's translation of the spinster sleuth's character, it's a must, despite the poor quality of the video, which has not survived well the move to DVD for US TV screens from the UK's more advanced system when the film was shot. Features are fuzzy, as if through a Vaselined lens . . . But the fun of Joan Dickson's performance is worth the frustrations, and as Jane Marple fuddy-duddides along in her relentless quest after yet another murderer - picking up her moniker of ""Nemesis,"" means this little gem is worth having in you library. When the rain patters on the windows and the chill knocks on your door, you could do much worse than light the fire, curl up with a spot of tea and a couple of crumpets with clotted cream and raspberry preserves and enjoy!",1232841600,7,858,4.541935483870968

I watched this movie without reading the 1964 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve full-length Miss Marple murder mysteries.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

The movie begins with Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) at a hotel resort on Barbados Island located in the Caribbean Sea which is bounded on one side by the West Indies.  (The West Indies is a large group of islands located between North America and South America.  The Barbados is actually a country on the easternmost island of the West Indies.)  At the hotel she meets a retired major who tells her of his past adventures.  One of the last things he says to Miss Marple is:

""Like to see the picture of a killer?""

As the major is about to hand the picture to the senior super sleuth, he unexpectedly sees the murderer at the island hotel.  Miss Marple never sees the picture or sees who the major was looking at.  The next day the major turns up dead.  The death is suspected of being a murder and Inspector Weston (Joe Mydell) officially investigates and Miss Marple unofficially investigates.  Eventually, two more deaths and an attempted suicide occur.

Who are the people at this island hotel?  They are as follows:

(1) Retired Major Palgrave (Frank Middlemass)

(2) Retired tycoon Jason Rafiel (Donald Pleasence)

(3) Hotel owner Tim Kendall (Adrian Lukis)

(4) Tim's wife, Molly (Sophie Ward)

(5) The tycoon's nurse, Esther Walters (Barbara Barnes)

(6) Flirt Lucky Dyson (Sue Lloyd)

(7) Lucky's husband, Greg (Robert Swan)

(8) Housewife Evelyn Hillington (Sheila Ruskin)

(9) Evelyn's husband, Edward (Michael Feast)

(10) Dr. Graham (T.P. McKenna)

(11) Hotel Maid Victoria (Valerie Buchanan)

(12) The tycoon's aid Jackson (Stephen Bent)

There is brief mention of the Greek goddess ""Nemesis"" in this movie.  Nemesis is the title of a popular Miss Marple novel (and was made into a movie starring Joan Hickson).  The character Jason Rafiel appears again in this novel.

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance.  (Hickson was 83 years old in this movie!)  Another good performance to look for is Donald Pleasence as the grumpy tycoon.

A feature of this movie is that it was filmed on location in Barbados, West Indies.  Thus, the cinematography is breath-taking.

Finally, there is an earlier Americanized version of this movie starring Helen Hayes as Miss Marple.  This movie was quite well done but I felt that it was not quite as good as this British version.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

(1989;  100 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)

7837999,5,6303111572,"This is a well-done adaptation of a very good mystery. When one starts to watch it, one will find it hard to be distracted from it. As usual with Miss Marple mysteries, a number of statements are made and a number of acts done, which if noticed, will reveal the murderer. The viewer needs to look at every event and statement and decide if it is a red herring or is decisive in solving the case. This what happens in this film. The decisive statements and acts do stand out, but viewers may only see them in retrospect.
The drama starts in the Caribbean, at a hotel, when an elderly man, who does not seem able to stop talking, mentions to Miss Marple that he has a picture which shows a man who killed two people and got away with it. Miss Marple is intrigued, but before she can talk further with the man, he dies (or is he killed?). The picture disappears. Other events are: a cleric who is enchanted by the wife of the hotel owner, a man having affairs with many women, a woman selling voodoo articles, and more. The wife of the hotel owner is acting very strangely. She is convinced that she sees dead people, and has other irrational ideas.",1491523200,,1146,4.334883720930232
7838000,4,6303111572,"In 1989, the BBC adapted Agatha Christies 1964 novel A Caribbean Mystery for its Agatha Christies Miss Marple series, starring Joan Hickson as the eponymous spinster sleuth. Miss Marples nephew has arranged for her to take a holiday on Barbados to recover from a bout of bronchitis, at a resort run by a handsome young couple, Tim and Molly Kendal (Adrian Lukas & Sophie Ward). Miss Marple passes her time knitting and staring at the beach, half-listening to Maj. Palgrave (Frank Middlemass) regale her with stories of his time in the army, the Colonial Police, big game hunting, etc. One day, he tells a story about a man whose wife died under suspicious circumstances and asks: Would you like to see a photograph of a murderer? But he recognizes someone on the veranda before Miss Marple sees the photo and quickly puts it away. After drinking heavily at dinner that night, Maj. Palgrave dies, apparently of cardiac problems.

The circumstances seem suspicious, and Miss Marple is determined to see that photograph, especially when she learns that a maid at the resort, Victoria Johnson (Valerie Buchanon), observed that Maj. Palgrave did not have blood pressure pills until after he died. She navigates the list of suspects, the Kendals, the Dysons, the Hillingdons, all unhappy couples, and the irascible Mr. Rafiel (Donald Pleasence), confined to a wheelchair and attended by Jackson (Stephen Bent) and Esther Walters (Barbara Barnes), while the local authority, Inspector Weston (Joseph Mydell), exhumes the Majors body. Although the relationship between the Dysons and Hillingdons is convoluted, this isn't one of Agatha Christies more intricate plots. I like this adaptation, because Miss Marple is a displaced English villager in search of a village, and the supporting characters are believable, except perhaps for the murderer. It feels less contrived and less obvious than the 2014 adaptation.",1467331200,,1905,5.2254901960784315

7838002,2,6303111572,"I have long heard of the series that A&E ran based on the works of Agatha Christie, but I've never sat down to watch any of them.  Heck, for a mystery fan I am shockingly ignorant of many of the works of the great mystery writer.  I decided to fix both of those at the same time, and started with A Caribbean Mystery, a full length movie based on a Miss Marple novel.  I think I should have started with something else.

The story finds spinster Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) in Barbados on a trip to recover her health.  It's a nice gesture by her nephew, but she's bored out of her mind.  She's even taken to listening to the stories of Major Palgrave (Frank Middlemass) who rambles on about big game hunting and murders he's solve.  One morning he's found dead in his room.  It looks like natural causes, but Miss Marple begins to suspect something more is afoot.  Is she right?

My understanding is that this movie sticks very closely to the book.  Honestly, that's the first strike against it.  The killer is obvious early on, and there's really nothing there to throw you off the scent.  I kept waiting for the twist that never came.  Usually, Agatha Christie makes me suspect everyone in the story, but that's definitely not the case here.

Agatha Christie also isn't known for her depth of character, but this movie makes it even worse.  I was two thirds of the way through before I had all the characters down, and even then I mixed a couple up in the final few minutes.  They were introduced so quickly and haphazardly it was hard to remember them all.

Honestly, this movie should have been under an hour and a half, probably closer to an hour.  I felt like several of the scenes were stretched to make it longer.  And the habit of cutting several scenes together didn't help things at all.  Instead, it helped my confusion over characters and their relationships.  Heck, there are some characters I still don't quite understand how all fit together.  Meanwhile, those quick cuts were irritating and distracting.  Ironically, they also helped make the movie seem painfully slow.

Having seen this, I can understand why so many people praise Joan Hickson as Miss Marple.  She makes for a great lead character, bright but unassuming, just like she's supposed to be.  The rest of the cast rises about the material and does their best to bring things to life.  But they don't have good material to work with and are hampered by the direction.  On an interesting note, Donald Pleasence appears here as a businessman also staying at the resort.

Even though I am not super familiar with Agatha Christie's work, I know she can do better than A Caribbean Mystery.  And I'm willing to give these movies a second chance since I've heard such good things about it.  But this is not a good place to start.",1432339200,,2801,4.562248995983936
