6600851,4,B00MU00G9S,"Gounod's ""Faust"" is undoubtedly the best-known operatic adaptation of Goethe's famous story, although its popularity is not what it once was. Personally, I've always preferred Boito's ""Mefistofele.""

I was fortunate to catch the 1989 San Francisco Opera production, currently available on a regular DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boito-Mefistofele-Arena-Ramey-Benackova-San-Francisco-Opera/dp/B00005NGA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boito - Mefistofele / Arena, Ramey, Benackova, San Francisco Opera</a>). It's still a fond memory, so I looked forward to receiving a Blu-ray review copy of the revival that took place in late 2013. As expected, the 16:9 (full HDTV screen) high-definition picture does a much better job of capturing the colorful production, which seems traditional by today's standards, despite the nudity.

First, let's consider the revival on its own merits.

Ildar Abdrazakov is an effective, barrel-chested Mefistofele, with a velvety baritonal voice. Ramon Vargas seems unusually placid as Faust -- there's little of the passion or anguish you'd expect from someone who's bet his soul. Vocally he's fine, albeit underpowered, particularly in his upper register. He fully comes into his own, though, in the final scene, where his lyrical approach pays off. Patricia Racette, on the other hand, is a fully committed performer throughout and sings both Margherita and Elena well, despite some pushed high notes.

The audio is very good -- be sure to switch from the PCM stereo default to DTS 5.1 surround sound. One caveat: The soloists' voices aren't quite as forward as one would expect, particularly Vargas'. The chorus in this gloriously chorus-heavy opera sounds spectacular. The orchestra, conducted by Nicola Luisotti, sounds great too.

The picture quality is also very good, although a notch less sharp than other recent classical Blu-rays I've seen.

It's only when you compare this revival to the 1989 production that it comes up short. Samuel Ramey was born to play Mefistofele, and his voice is thrilling from top to bottom. Dennis O'Neill is passionate and, despite his Welsh background, couldn't sound more Italianate in phrasing (unlike Vargas, who sometimes seems to have wandered in from Gounod's French version). Gabriela Benackova has a beautiful voice that absolutely blooms in the upper reaches, and she acts nearly as well as Racette. To cap it all off, Maurizio Arena's conducting is more propulsive, which helps de-emphasize the opera's rougher patches.

But it's a 25-year-old performance, so the DVD image is much less sharp and smaller (4:3), and the sound (though clear and favoring the soloists more) is limited to stereo.",1416355200,12,3044,6.065116279069767

6600854,5,B00MU00G9S,"This is a clever and, in some scenes, luxurious staging of this curious opera, which, though not exactly beautiful, deserves being better known. Ildar Abdazakov in the title role is splendid throughout: witty, ironic, wicked, with full command of the scene. Patricia Racette movingly sings and acts Margherita's role in Act III, and then, with almost incredible versatility, turns into a magnificently regal and tragic Helena in Act IV. On the other hand, though Ramn Vargas is a first-rate tenor, who sings the Faust part with flying colors, dressed in a white frock-coat he looks more like a successful grocer than like a skeptical and mildly depraved intellectual whose flesh is sad after reading all books. Maybe it is because as a Spanish American I am too familiar with his body language, but the fact is that I have some difficulty in realizing that he impersonates Goethe's hero. I admit that Jonas Kaufmann, who was cast as Faust in a recent recording of Gounod's opera, goes perhaps a bit too far in the opposite direction; but still, his physical presence is much what a senescent scholar would like to get if he sells his soul to the Devil.",1413849600,10,1152,4.8232323232323235
6600855,4,B00MU00G9S,"This is a lightly polished revival of the San Francisco production of several decades ago. [Kultur DVD, still available, full screen, not HD]  It was an excellent production then and so it is now.  The crowd scenes have been more carefully rehearsed and staged, the orchestra plays better and with greater energy this time around, and the witches sabbath has been jazzed up with more and better movements for the chorus members and with more bare flesh exposed.  For those who may be interested or concerned, for whatever reasons, the nudity is appropriate but actually neither particularly shocking or delightful.  On the back of the package, there appears in small print the statement: ""This production contains real and simulated nudity."" There, now that topic is out of the way.

Samuel Ramey owned the role of Mefistofele.  He out acts and out sings Abdrazakov at every turn - indeed, Carsen on the whole has Abdrazakov follow nearly exactly the same stage movements as he did Ramey, such that Abdrazakov comes across a bit of an imitation of Ramey.  Let me just say that Abdrazakov is very good, but Ramey was convincingly evil and fabulously funny in the role.

In each production the lead tenor (O'Neill then, Vargas now) sings well but is pleasantly plump and not the image of a young man once his journeys with Mefistofele have begun.  Gabriela Benackova (then) and Racette (now) perform the roles of Margareta and Helen of Troy with lovely singing and believable characterization, whether as village maid or Queen of Troy.  The duets with the tenor are equally ravishing.

All in all, if you want to see and hear Ramey at his peak in the context of a fine performance, buy the DVD on Kultur.  If you want to see and hear the opera as a whole with better sound and somewhat better orchestral playing (I think that  Luisotti is a better conductor than Arena) and see and hear slightly better choral singing, you will want the 2014 BR/DVD version.  I should emphasize that in this opera the chorus and orchestra play major roles and do not just support or accompany the singers.  The Prologue in Heaven can (and sometimes does) stand alone as a concert piece with two sarcastic and wickedly funny arias for Mefistofele tucked in.

Not sure how to decide?  Get both versions and become closely acquainted with the opera while enjoying the task of comparing the performances in general and certainly with specific attention to details.",1413590400,23,2441,4.829326923076923
6600856,5,B00MU00G9S,"Terrific but Controversial in several ways.  The performance is first-rate with all soloists doing beautiful jobs with their roles and the chorus and orchestra succeeding in bringing this magnificent score to life.  The glorious Prolog in Heaven is extremely well done by the chorus.  Controversial because of the significant amount of ""real and simulated nudity"" among the chorus, especially in the Walpurgis Night scene ( which was warmly applauded by the audience ).  This may not be to everyone's taste and the buyer should be aware of it before buying the product.  I was not offended by it and found that it fit the circumstances of the scene.  The package contains a warning about ""real and simulated nudity"" in the performance, by the way, so the buyer should not be taken unaware of it.

8674474,2,B00MU00G9S,"The singing and acting is good throughout but in my opinion the production/direction ruins a few scenes. Also the way penises are prominently displayed  in the Walpurgis night scene may be repulsive to some--although admittedly  it is not unreasonable for producer  Robert Carsen to imagine warlocks dancing with their exposed  penises bouncing up and down, and some viewers may not mind or even enjoy this.

8674477,5,B00MU00G9S,"It's a good thing that Robert Carsen's well-traveled production A) was chosen for videotaping and B) Blu-Ray had been invented in time to capture. The richness of color and subtle tints of Michael Levine's set designs provide a visual feast that few operas on DVD can rival, let alone match. Carsen's staging, put through its paces by revival director Laurie Feldman, is as fresh now as it was in 1990, when it was new and PBS filmed Samuel Ramey, Gabriela Benackova and Dennis O'Neill in the principal roles. The current protagonists need make no apologies. Ildar Azdrabakov's Mefistofele owns a blacker, deeper tone than Ramey and if there's an occasional hint of Boris Christoff in his interpretation, it's all to the good. He makes a sufficiently entertaining devil on his own terms as to render comparisons with Ramey moot.

Ramon Vargas is less of a spinto than O'Neill, more a pure lyric tenor and, after a scratchy opening scene, he dispenses a seemingly endless supply of blandishing, liquid tone. He also makes a convincing switch from the stiff-gaited, prudish Faust of the first act to the ardent pleasure-seeker of the remainder of the opera. I don't understand the carping about Vargas' appearance: He's always looked as he does here and, besides, few tenors today can rival him for quality of vocalism. Patricia Racette does make a few concessions to age (or a too-heavy mix of repertory) in the form of a pronounced 'beat' when signing high at forte. In other words, it's not as pristine a sound as Benackova's. For the most part, though, Racette is as passionate and personal an interpreter as always, excelling both as a Method actress (as the deranged Margherita) and a Classical tragedienne (as Helen of Troy).

Nicola Luisotti is marked improvement over predecessor Maurizio Arena, combining a Toscanini-like grandeur in scenes like the opening 'Prologue in Heaven' with scampering wit in Boito's scherzando episodes, and he has the San Francisco Opera Orchestra sounding like a world-class band. The only substantial caveat for sensitive viewers is that there's frontal nudity, and quite a lot of it, in the witches' sabbath scene. Consider yourself warned.",1443484800,4,2179,5.066852367688022

Abdrazakov gives a robust, active performance, but Samuel Ramey is just chillingly evil.  Otherwise this is a fine presentation of the opera and is certainly worth hearing and viewing.",1424563200,2,333,5.384615384615385
8674482,4,B00MU00G9S,"That Arrigo Boito was of great intellectual capacity is attested to by his work for Verdi. He was instrumental in forming and creating the librettos for the last two of Verdi's superb masterpieces and helped to revise and reform several other of Verdi's mature works. On his own he wrote several librettos of promise but his muse of music composition failed him. I have familiarity with two of these: Mefistofele and Nerone. Mefistofele is a hodge podge with a great Prologue and Nerone is again an eclectic muddle with one moving scene - that of Rubria's death. Goethe's Faust legend has not been well served in it's several operatic treatments.
Mefistofele had a disastrous opening night at La Scala in 1868. The critics and public liked the prologue but hissed the rest of it as ""over long"", ""uninspired"", ""disconnected"", "" rambling mess"" that lasted till well after midnight. Occasional revivals are usually associated with star bass singers as Shaliapin at La Scala in 1901 or later with Ezio Pinza always as revised scores. New York City Opera played it fairly frequently for Norman Treigle and later for Samual Ramey. The later was in a legendary production by the San Francisco Opera of which this production  is a revival. I've had the privilege to see both of these versions. Both were excellent but Samual Ramey had real star power magnetism and out sang every body before or since including this present recording.
In the present recording the devil is Ildar Abdrasakov, a very competent singer and actor who enjoys playing the part and does a commanding job giving us an excellent performance. When he is on stage all goes well. Unfortunately we cannot say the same for the Faust of Ramon Vargas. A singer he is but no actor. In a first rate opera where the musical action alone can carry  the story his ""park and bark"" approach is acceptable but in this opera with only passable music, acting must carry the show. He is totally card-board stiff and never rumples his white suit. Also in a large opera house you don't see his face which is an advantage.
The other major player is Patricia Racette as Margarita and Elena (Helen of Troy). Her performance of the ""Death of Margarita"" scene was the dramatic high point of the opera. She commands a large lush voice with fine resonance and she can act. In the ""garden scene"" the tree and flower merry-go-round as she is romanced (awkwardly) by Faust and later the same revolving disc with charred wood and dead flowers is where she laments the death of her baby she drowned and her mother she has poisoned. She is a powerful presence  .
The production itself is highly detailed and grandiose; no barren stage and a twig to representing a forest as in so many current Regie-Eurotrash operas. It is a revival of the opera as done for Ramey. The stage always has lots of activity going on. In the Walpurgis Night crowds cavort on the red-lighted stage complete with with swirling ladies with exposed breasts and men with exposed genitalia. A grand romp around the devil's dance!
Much more subdued is the classic  Walpurgis Night with Helen of Troy again well done by Patricia Racette.
The last scene is the death of Faust and is totally undramatic as if the composer had run totally out of inspiration. But the production as a whole is much fun and worth a revival now and then.",1421625600,4,3333,4.711835334476844
