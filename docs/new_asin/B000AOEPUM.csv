2390200,4,B000AOEPUM,"1. Match #1 of the Best of 7 Series for the United States Championship: Chris Benoit vs. Booker T w/ Sharmell
A good opener, the crowd really gets behind Benoit in this one. Booker seems a little sloppy at times, but its forgiveable and doesn't ruin the pace of the match. A little slow at parts too, but overall a good match to start the show. 7/10

2. WWE Women's Championship Match: Trish Stratus (c) vs. Melina
Not a bad women's match, but skip this, there are matches on here more worthy of your time. 4/10

3. Last Man Standing Match: Ric Flair vs. Triple H
Wow. Just when I thought I knew what brutal was, this comes along. This match is nothing but a methodical, physical dissection (as good ol' J.R. would say) of the Nature Boy. Triple H sends Flair to hell and back in this one, and this is a great match. Many weapons used, including a screwdriver, steel steps, and The Game's favorite, the sledgehammer. These two work very well together, and its a well paced and entertaining match. 9/10

4. WWE Championship Match: John Cena (c) vs. Kurt Angle
These two have had many, many matches together, and they are all good, but this one falls a bit short. I'm not sure if its the special referee stipulation, or maybe they've just run out of things to do with each other, but this one is a little more boring then most of them. Still a good title match, but it isn't anything special. Crowd really gets into this one, and they're split about 50/50 between Cena and Angle. A decent match, but these two have done much better together.  7/10

5. General Manager vs. General Manager Match: Eric Bischoff vs. Theodore Long
Skip this. I'm not sure why this is even on the card, its pretty much a time waster, and thats what it will be for you if you choose to watch it. Stay away, and get to the main event. 0/10

6. Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match: Team Raw (HBK, Kane, Big Show, Chris Masters and Carlito) vs. Team Smackdown (Batista, Randy Orton, JBL, Rey Mysterio, and Lashley)
As usual, Survivor Series delivers a great 5 on 5 elimination tag match. I liked the fued that they built this match around, but the commentators take it too far by practically screaming at each other during the entire match. Its not unbearable, but it gets close. The match itself is very good, each team member looks like they belong, and does their job well. Everybody puts on a good performance, and there are some very cool eliminations, including a couple good ones by the Showstopper (as if there was any doubt). The ending is good, especially with the Deadman himself, The Undertaker, making his presence felt on his return. 9/10

Overall, this is a good Survivor Series, and has a very solid card, with only one dud (Bischoff vs. Long). Some matches leave a little to be desired (Benoit vs. Booker, and Cena vs. Angle), but they are still decent/pretty good matches that shouldn't be overlooked. This show is definitely worth your time and money, there is a lot of entertainment here.

Match of the Night: The Elimination Tag match: Team Raw vs. Team Smackdown. Very entertaining match, with some great eliminations and good performances from the veterans as well as some of the younger talent on both shows (Lashley, Masters, and Carlito). This PPV ends on a good note too, with 'Taker making his return.",1151798400,5,3311,4.581081081081081

Chris Benoit vs Booker T  8/10

This was an excellent match and definitely had a suprising ending.

Trish Stratus vs Melina 6/10

This was probably the best womens match all year.

Ric Flair vs HHH 9.5/10

This was very brutal when the scredriver came into play...2nd best match of the night.

Kurt Angle vs John Cena 8/10

Definitly better than their match at Unforgiven. I was still a little dissapointed at the finish because John Cena sucks.

Erich Bischoff vs Theo Long 2/10

This was just a waste of time with Theodore pulling off the victory because of the Boogeyman.

Team Smackdown! vs Team Raw 10/10

I was really pulling for Raw to win but when Carlito was eliminated I started to doubt how much of a chance Shawn Micheals had. RKO makes this match best of the night.

This match was match one of the best of seven series. This was a pretty good match, but not as good as some other matches these two have had. Booker-T wins it when he rolls Benoit up and uses the ropes and Sharmel for leverage.

Winner: Booker-T

Rating: 7.5/10

Match 2: Trish Stratus w/ Mickie James vs Melina w/ Nitro and Mercury for the Woman's Championship

I think this match was an above average woman's match. Melina, who is becoming a decent wrestler, and Trish, the greatest woman wrestler on the planet, impressed me with this match. The outside interference wasn't to bad either, as Nitro and Mercury were banished from ringside. Trish wins it with a modified Stratusfaction.

Winner, and still Woman's Champion, Trish Stratus.

Rating: 7/10

Match 3: HHH vs Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing Match

I thought that this match was very good, as both men took a lot of punishment. The match started before Flair got to the ring, and blasted HHH with some heavy kendo stick shots. HHH tortured Ric Flair throughout most of the match, bur Flair had a few moments of strong offense, such as back body dropping HHH through the announce table. HHH wins it after 3 pedigrees and a sledgehammer shot.

Winner, HHH

Rating: 9/10

Match 4: Kurt Angle vs John Cena fot the World Wrestling Entertainment Championship with Daivari as the special guest referee.

This was a good match, even though the feud was getting old. The beginning wasn't special, but it started to pick up. The end came when Cena flung Angle into Daivari, knocking Daivari out. Cena then won it with the F-U, which was counted by a Smackdown referee.

Winner, and still WWE Champion, John Cena

Rating: 3/10

The Main Event: Team Smackdown (Batista, Rey Mysterio, JBL, Randy Orton, and Bobby Lashley) vs Team Raw (Carlito, Chris Masters, HBK, Kane, and The Big Show)

This was a very good main event, and the match of the night. It was full of great performers. The first elimination came when Lashley was Chokeslammed by Kane from the ring apron. Kane was next to go after a Batista Spine Buster. Batista was then eliminated by a double chokeslam from Big Show and Kane (who was already eliminated). Big Show was next to go after multiple JbL clotheslines and a Rey Misterio West Coast Pop. Carlito and Masters were then easily dispatched, and it is Rey, Orton, and JBL vs HBK. When Rey tried a West Coast Pop, HBK reversed it into a Superkick and pinned him. JBl was eliminated by Michaels with Sweet Chin Music seconds later. Orton finally eliminated HBK with the RkO (and JBL distraction).

Booker vs. Benoit ***

Ok match, 1st in 7 series, their intention was to have different matches so thats why this one was kinda slow.

Trish vs. Melina *1/2

OK match, brilliant commentary by Tazz & Styles, hillarious.

HHH vs. Flair ****

Edge of your seat stuff, Last man standing. Amazing match. Cool finish, a lot of effort from both guys.

OK match, too much interference etc. Crowd was split between them.

Horrible, just horrible and thats all i can say about it

Team Raw vs. Team SmackDown. ***1/2

Fun match, lots of action, too many commentators.

1. Match #1 of the best of 7 series for the vacated U.S. Title

Chris Benoit vs. Booker T

This was a great match. I haven't seen their Armageddon or No Way Out matches so I can't compare. It was a good match but felt a little slow at some points. Still, a great matchup. 8 out of 10.

2. Trish Stratus vs. Melina(WWE Women's Championship)

This was an interpromotional match. I'm normally not a big fan of women's matches, but this was very good. The only other women's match that I like is the one from Judgment Day 2001. Melina is not only the hottest diva in the WWE,she is a great wrestler too. I feel that she got screwed at the end. 8 out of 10.

3. Last Man Standing

Triple H vs. Ric Flair

This match was not about the Intercontinental Title;it was personal. It was also a very brutal and very good match as well. A variety of weapons were used,such as a screwdriver,steel chair,kendo stick,announcers table and a sledgehammer. Ric Flair was pretty bloody,and the ending didn't feel fake or scripted. 10 out of 10.

4. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle(WWE Championship)

Special Ref:Daivari

After about the first 5 minutes,Daivari was out of the match. This was a good match overall,but too many referees hurt it. There were about 4 or 5 refs used. The crowd was into it though. 8 out of 10.

5. GM vs. GM Match

Eric Bischoff vs. Teddy Long

I expected this match to be bad,and it was. This was not a match at all;it was Bischoff dominating most of the match. The only bright spots were the Boogeyman appearing and that Teddy Long dances funny. 5 out of 10.

6. Raw vs. Smackdown(5 on 5 Elimination Match)

Team Raw-Shawn Michaels,Chris Masters,Big Show,Kane and Carlito vs. Team Smackdown-Batista,Rey Mysterio,Randy Orton,Lashley and JBL

This was the best Elimination match since the 2003 Survivor Series. It had good length and none of the eliminations felt rushed. I think Lashley has great potential and he looked good in this match. The commentary was good and funny too. 10 out of 10.

I normally don't rate segments,but this one was the biggest thing of the night. The Undertaker returned in a flaming casket and demolished all of ""B"" list Smackdown Superstars,much to Randy Orton's dismay. 10 out of 10.(It led to the Hell in a Cell Match at Armageddon.)",1141084800,,2328,4.555288461538462

Vacated United States Championship

Best Of Seven Series

Match #1

Booker T(w/ Sharmell) vs Chris Benoit - Not a bad match here & a great opener.  This doesn't top any of their previous matches in either WWE or WCW but it's still good.

Women's Championship

Raw vs Smackdown

Trish Stratus(w/ Micki James) vs Melina(w/ MNM) - Honestly, with the womens division down to only 3 women who can wrestle & the rest who only have a job because they look good in a bikini...this has been the best womens title match in over a year.  Melina can actually go & Trish didn't have to carry another wrestler.  MNM & James at ringside helped the match too.  The only thing I can say that's bad is Tazz doing commentary & tryin' to talk over Joey Styles the whole match.

Last Man Standing

Triple H vs Ric Flair - This along with the cage match at Taboo Tuesday is a big F-U to those who say Flair has no business in the ring.  I enjoyed their cage match better than this but it was still one of the best matches of the night.

""The Cutting Edge"" segment with Edge & Lita was entertaining.  This Rated R Superstar gimmick is a perfect fit with Edge.

WWE Championship

Special Guest Referee: Daivari

John Cena vs Kurt Angle - Boy, they were tryin' so hard to have people cheer for Cena & boo Angle that it completely ruined this match.  Too much outside interference with the referees & worring about the Davari factor.  It's watchable but it's too obivious they're tryin' too hard to FORCE the people to cheer for Cena.

Raw vs Smackdown

Eric Bischoff vs Theodore Long(w/ Palmer Canon) - Remember when I talked about that one exception earlier, this is it.  It wasn't even really match...it's just them catfighting (and that's putting it lightly) until Boogeyman came out & did his usual stick with Bischoff.  Dud.

Raw vs Smackdown

Elimination Match

Shawn Michaels, Big Show, Kane, Chris Masters & Carlito vs Batista, Rey Mysterio, Bobby Lashley, JBL(w/ Jillian Hall) & Randy Orton(w/ Cowboy Bob Orton) - FIRST OF ALL, PRESS THE MUTE BUTTON because Tazz & Cole (mostly Tazz) just wouldn't shut up.  Instead of tryin' to actually call a match, they're ""shooting"" & talking over the RAW announce team a majority of the time...even to the point to where Joey Styles gave up & just sat quietly.  They cared more about ""shooting"" on King & Coach & Styles more than anything going on in the ring.

As for the match itself, typical Survivor Series match where the newcomers were the first ones elimated quick to give the veterans they're time to shine.  Dull at some parts but overall enjoyable.

The return of the Undertaker came at the end where he basically beat up the ""B"" SmackDown superstars before staring down Randy Orton (if your wondering why Matt Hardy has been jobbing lately, watch him leave the ring while everyone else is getting beat up).

DVD extras include Shane McMahon visiting Teddy Long backstage before being confronted by the Boogeyman, Kurt Angle & Davari's visit to the WWE.com's interview area after his match, and Maria asking what Vince McMahon's favorite S.

Awesome match! Very brutal! Ric Flair shows he still has what it takes to put on a great match. He bleeds most of the way through the match. In the end, it takes 3 predigrees and a sledgehammer shot to keep the Nature Boy down for the 10 count. Probably the match of the night.

Best Of Seven Series

Match #1

Booker T(w/ Sharmell) vs Chris Benoit 7/10- not as good as it could have been. they put on a good show but nothing spectacular. screwy ending. i don't like best of 7's. too long & drawn out.

Women's Championship

Raw vs Smackdown

Trish Stratus(w/ Micki James) vs Melina(w/ MNM) 5/10- not bad for a ladies match. the outsiders keep it interesting.

Last Man Standing

Triple H vs Ric Flair 9/10- not as good as the cage match but better than a lot of matches here. this is intense & bloody. the match of the night. this should have been the semifinal match.

Edge & Lita came  out to hype their new segment on Raw & harassed the Detroit crowd. Tigers Designated Hitter Dimtri Young was confronted by Edge.

WWE Championship

Special Guest Referee: Daivari

John Cena vs Kurt Angle 6.5/10- thought this should have been the main event, but i was wrong. this is the worst match between these 2. the crooked referee gimmick is ruining Angle's career. he needs no assistance to win. too many run ins ruin this one. the bright spot was the ending.

Raw vs Smackdown

Eric Bischoff vs Theodore Long(w/ Palmer Canon) 2/10- this one really stunk! Long can't even fight. Bischoff had to carry him. how sad! the only bright spot was the appearance of the Boogeyman. Long is funny when he dances.

Raw vs Smackdown

Elimination Match

Shawn Michaels, Big Show, Kane, Chris Masters & Carlito vs Batista, Rey Mysterio, Bobby Lashley, JBL(w/ Jillian Hall) & Randy Orton(w/ Cowboy Bob Orton) 8.5/10- a pretty good concept that worked fairly well. the tragic death of Eddie Guerrero took away from this match. Orton was his replacement. the injury of Edge brought Masters into this one also. Lashley replaced Matt Hardy who was hurt also. too many injuries tainted this one. the idea of having babyfaces & heels working together was good. the flow was smooth at times but had some dull spots in it. the ending was great.

The Undertaker returned at the end of Survivor Series after a 7 week layoff.

overall, this was just an ordinary Survivor Series. nothing fantastic or memorable. for all the interpromotional hype, it was disappointing. WWE is in a funk right now. they are missing key stars & Guerrero will be hard to replace. TNA is an up & coming organization. if TNA continues to rise, they will give WWE a run for their money which would be good for wrestling.",1136678400,5,2422,4.6674528301886795

2390220,3,B000AOEPUM,"This year's Survivor Series was one of the best shows of the year. Here's my review.

Survivor Series Elimination Match

Smackdown v. Raw ***-- This is a fun match. If you can stand the commentary in the background, this match had some decent buil up to it and proved to be a heck of a lot more fun than I anticipated. The match was booked pretty well with the exception of the hokiness afterwards. Orton goes over, which was the right call. Fun, but too spotty to call GOOD.

WWE Championship-- Special Guest Referee

John Cena v. Kurt Angle **1/2-- Everyone wants to ride John Cena lately but it's not him who's bringing this feud down. Kurt Angle has been absolutely awful. Now granted the real onus lies in the laps of the creative team who've managed to make this feud about as bad as humanly possible. This match was fairly well paced but once we got to the last five minutes it just fell apart and got to be way, way too messy for my tastes. Cena isn't allowed to do anything but his trademark stuff and Angle is just, well atrocious at the moment. Seems like he's a little too preoccupied with convincing creative he can be a good champion but doesn't seem to want to prove it by 'carrying' Cena. Either way this fell apart quickly.

Last Man Standing Match

Triple H v. Ric Flair ****-- This is quite possibly the WWE match of the year with the exception of the first Angle-HBK encounter and the first match between these two at Taboo Tuesday. The psychology is brilliant even though the pedigree is cheapened a bit in the end. Both bring the hate with believable spots that aren't over done with the exception of the 900 pedigrees in the end. The middle finger kinda cancels that all out though giving us one HELL of a match by WWE standards. Great, great stuff from both of these guys.

Teddy Long v. Eric Bischoff DUD-- There had to be one I suppose. This was awful and with the exception of the Boogeyman appearance (which people have to admit, it's so bad it's good. Team this guy with Snitsky NOW), it had zero redeeming value.

WWE Women's Championship

Trish Stratus v. Melina

Far, far better than I expected and Melina has improved an awful lot for someone who hasn't spent too much time in the ring since her car wreck of a match with Michelle McCool back in May. Trish does a decent carry job here and an okay effort for the girls. *3/4

WWE United States Championship--Best of Seven Series

Booker T v. Chris Benoit **3/4-- A good start up to this series. These two mix remarkably well given their polar opposite styles. This really set the night off on the right foot and go the crowd juiced the right way for the rest of the show. An opener most definately worth watching.

OVERALL: B- -- There was some good, some bad, and some ugly on this pay per view, but with two good matches and one very fun match, this all came together for some reason. The crowd gives this show a lift as well. The women's match was better than I thought and Cena-Angle let us a little lost. The only out and out awful match was of course the GM-GM match. Solid pay per view and one of the better shows of the year. Worth a watch.",1136160000,2,3131,4.368330464716007

2390222,3,B000AOEPUM,"Before I get into this little review, I'm going to clearly address the John Cena issue like everyone else, most of the defenses for Cena are actually all from marks who treat wrestling like Cena is actually doing any of this, winning matches, breaking out of submissions, etc, all on his own. Wake up, hes' booked to win, hence he comes off as Superman, when we all know in three seconds he'd tap if former talent Daniel Puder put him in a predicament similar to what he did with Angle. Heck, even Angle could own him if he really wanted to shoot.

...Wrestling is scripted. Cena didn't persevere when held in the walls of Jericho, or the Ankle lock, or the sharpshooter, or your mothers' bearhug, he survives those submissions because he and his opponents are booked to have him survive those submissions, thats' it, so stop with this ""Chain Gang Is The Click"" rubbish, it is a severly depressing reminder of how lazy and cartoony Cena has become since his days as a cutting edge 2003 heel who was not afraid to rip apart John Ritter a week after his death.

Now, onto the PPV.

1. Best of Seven Serirs For The WWE United States Championship: Booker T vs Chris Benoit: We begin the event with a quality collision between reliable performer Chris Benoit and the reinvigorated Booker T, both began this series well, and started a month long story which saw Benoit lose three matches in a row, beggining here, but despite coming up short, Benoit puts in a great performance and gets the crowd riled for what is to follow ***

2. Trish Stratus vs Melina: First interpromtoional match of the night, Trish carries Melina as good as she can, match was not that much of a train wreck, but good entertainment and ab reath of fress air as far as womens' matches are now by WWE standards **

3. Triple H vs Ric Flair: A lengthy match, not quite as gripping as their steel cage classic at Taboo Tuesday, and indeed Flair botches some spots, but its' a good, if slightly rushed, climax to their feud that had just begun picking up steam. ***1/2

4. WWE Championship: John Cena vs Kurt Angle: As I've stated above, Cena is booked to be Superman, WWE fans for the most part are no longer that stupid to follow Cena like hes' Hogan, all of the positive reaction for Cena was from women and children, the only demographic Cena honestly speaks to now, once Cena vs Angle was a solid encounter, now its' repetitive, stale, and carries with it shoddy overbooking and a predictable finish. ***/2

6. Eric Bischoff vs Theodore Long: Second interpromotional match, a waste of time and money

7. RAW VS SMACKDOWN: Some interesting events stem from this match, Tazz and Cole ripping apart the RAW Brodcast team makes the match what it is, entertaining, aside from contributions from dependable talents like Micheals, Kane, JBL, Orton, and Mysterio, guys like Lashly shouldn't have been booked to be eliminated first, and Chris Masters and Carlito should never have been in the match to begin with. After Orton finsihes Micheals off and celebrats, 'Taker makes his return in spectaculary redundant fashion, come on 'Taker, do something NEW.

The RAW/SD rivalry could have been better, but aside from the main event, the remainder of the card has a mixed assortment of good and dissapointing matches.",1135900800,,3274,4.68

match 1: benoit vs. booker T  match one of best of 7 series

  Ok, obviousely this match was not great, they have fought like a million times, and it is almost always boring with these too.  Benoit needs to get in a rivalry with someone that will make him look good.  As always sharmell helped booker to win... maybe she should be the champ instead.\

winner:booker T

rating:4/10

match 2: Trish vs. Melina for the women's title

 This was a pleasing match, mostely cause these two are hottttt!.

It wasn't trish's best match but i was just pleased to see that she beat melina, cause i really didn't want her to win the title and take it to smackdown!

winner:Trish Stratus

rating:6/10

match 3:  Ric Flair vs. Triple H  Last man standing

  I loved this match.  Since flair is old, and getting weaker obviousely, i didn't really care to much for him being in such big matches.  Butt when he wone at Taboo tuesday, i decided to give him a chance.  I really expected Triple H to dominate, but flair did really well.  He stood up after an amazing three pedigrees. Off course it was the sledge hammer to the rescue (as always) and triple H was the winner.

winner:Triple H

rating:8/10

match 4: Cena vs. Angle  WWE championship match

 Ok, i know everyone is against cena and many have good reason.  I will agree he is not the best wrestler, and not the best rapper.  He is not really the champion a lot of people expected him to be.  Butt come on people.  Ever since cena wone the title, the reviews you guys have been riting have been going way down. I mean some of the reviews have nothing to do with the matches, all they talk about is how much cena sucks.  Get over it!!.  He's got a great future ahead of him, and already he has had a good career. I was a cena fan back in the day when he wasn't that popular and i am stickin with him.  This match was not the best these to have ever had, as to many refs were knocked out.  Both men cheated in bad ways.  Obviousely davairi was just unfair and then angle kept knocking out regs, but a smackdown! ref should have never counted for cena.  THe match should of continued.

winner: cena (retains title)

rating: 6.5/10

match 5: Teddy Long vs. Eric Bischoff

 Ok, i know almost everyone hates teddy long and loves eric bischoff. Well, at least most of the reviewers and critics do.  Butt come on, the unjust attacks on teddy long were just stupid, he needed some revenge on bischoff, and even though bischoff kicked his ass, it was funny when the boogeyman came in and kill eric.

winner:teddy long

rating:3/10

match 6: Team Smackdown vs. Team Raw

  Ok, there was tremendous hype for this match.  Actually this was pretty much the only match that got true hard core focus.  Everything else was put aside compared to this.  I wasn't disappointed, however it could of been longer, some disappointing parts, were ween certain superstars were eliminated a matter of seconds after they came in.  other than that, the match was good.  Although i like raw more then smackdown!, as it is obviousely the better show, smackdown! deserved this win.

Booker T vs. Chris Benoit- It's the return of the Best of Seven Series from wCw. This wasn't that good. We've seen this two fight OVER & OVER since Booker won the US belt. So that's what made it boring, seeing this two fight over and over.

Winner- Booker T.

Trish Stratus vs. Melina- Just your normal Divas match. But nice chick kick outside the ropes.

Winner- Trish Stratus

Last Man Standing Match:Ric Flair vs. Triple H- The Only match worth watching. I enjoyed this so much seeing Ric Flair Bleed like hell. This (like the Edge and Hardy bout) one of the best bouts that ended to quick. This is the MATCH OF THE NIGHT.

John Cena vs. Kurt Angle- This is one of their worst matches. To many ref.s coming in. Their Unforgiven match was better.

Winner- John Cena

RAW GM Eric Bischoff vs. SmackDown GM Teddy Long- This was more of a beat down on Teddy Long. The only good part is when the BoogieMan attacks Bischoff.

Winner Teddy Long.

Team Smackdown vs. Team RAW- Team Raw had great team members (HBK, Big Show, Kane Chris Masters). Carlito was the only bad member because he has NO finsher like the rest of the team. Now Team Smackdown had only two good members (Batista and Rey), Everyone else sucked. The wrong team wins (Smackdown) with the wrong guy winning it for them, Randy Orton. First off, Orton was only a filler for that team. 2nd, He had nothing to do with the story and 3rd, After almost ruining Eddie's tribute night (Thank God Cena Saved it), they make Orton take Eddie's place on the team, now that's BS. If anyone was going to win for Smackdown it should have been REY because is one of the only good team members for SMACKDOWN. Plus Undertaker should have been on this team.

Winner- Team Smackdown

The only thing that saved it was UNDERTAKER'S return. He was about to attack Orton, but Orton ran away like the pussy he is. Then he attacks all of those stupied Smackdown guys who cheered Orton on after the match (They deserve it).

Now the upcoming pay per view is No way out, sm has no good talents so they have to take Kane to be the main eventer with that stupid champ Batista. This batista is not the batista we had seen in Evolution. The changed, not an animal anymore. And hes got a back injury, he cant carry smackdown.

2390232,4,B000AOEPUM,"I read reviews of the latest PPVs where John Cena was in and I freaked out. So much hatred for Cena? Has he killed your momma or something?

  Relax, we put up with the moving meat called JBL for 10 months as a WWE Champion and still, the crowd was indifferent to him, with a few boos. But the treat that Cena gets from the fans lately is outta every limit, mainly in Taboo Tuesday 2005...

  I don't get it, since the crowd was going crazy from his early days in WWE, when people were really into John's (hip hop and so) style, his comfort with the mic, the word life element and his determination to create history. From then, he became better, starting to respect true values...Like his handshaking with RVD AFTER their match that determined who would face Booker T for the US tile, his worship signs towards Hogan and HBK after their tag team match against Jericho, Christian and Tomko, etc. That's class.

  The fabulous Eddie Guerrero  (God bless his soul, I will always remember Eddie) even told Cena, before his great match against Angle in No Way Out 2005 that Angle could put the ankle lock, but he believed to Cena that he wouldn't tap out. He said accurately 'I believe in you, I know they (the crowd) believe in you. God bless you'. Then they shook hands... The judgement is yours, you smart-a$$e$....

  What has Cena done to deserve his title, you say...Well, he didn't tap to the walls of jericho, neither to the ankle lock, in his reign as a WWE Champ. Moreover, he beat JBL in the 'I Quit' match, despite he was busted open from early in the match. How impressive was that? Then, Christian, Y2J, HBK and Angle wanted some, and they got it!...Cena beat them all till today. I don't care about you say. Cena gives his soul in the ring and throws a show to remember.

Chain Gang represents, cause the propaganda you make against the Doctor of Thuganomics is lame and people could believe that Cena has only haters. Oh boy....

Match #1: Best of Seven Series, Match #1: United States Championship: Chris Benoit vs. Booker T - 7/10

Decent contest between the two, but the ending sucked.

Match #2: Interpromotional Women's Championship Match: Melina vs. Trish Stratus - 8/10

This match was better than I'd expected. Short but great.

Match #3: Last Man Standing Match: Triple H vs. Ric Flair - 8.4/10

One word: BRUTAL. Triple H hitting Ric Flair with the screwdriver was sick but cool. The counter on the table where HHH attempts to Pedigree Flair was simple (a back body drop), but it also looked great. Nice match.

Match #4: WWE Championship: Kurt Angle vs. John Cena - 8/10

This match had a lot of crowd involvement, and that's what made it seem good enough. The ""Let's Go Cena"" ""Let's Go Angle"" chants kept going for about 3 minutes straight (I believe). The match itself had little bit of wrestling, but it was still good.

Match #5: Battle of the GM's: Theodore Long vs. Eric Bischoff - 4/10

This was lame, but I gave it a four because it was smart to have a SmackDown! vs. RAW General Manager match, but the match was horrible itself. Also, the Boogeyman making his in-ring debut, only to destroy Eric Bischoff with his Powerslam move.

Match #6: Team SmackDown! vs. Team RAW: Rey Mysterio, Randy Orton, Bobby Lashley, John Bradshaw Layfield & Batista vs. Big Show, Kane, Carlito, Chris Masters & Shawn Michaels - 8.9/10

Great match, it had lots of fast-paced action especially in the end. I liked the Big Show elimination, where JBL Clotheslined him twice, Orton RKO'd him, and Mysterio finally eliminating him from the match with a senton. Also the Lashley/Masters confrontation in the middle. Orton & HBK were the last two from both teams, where Orton RKO's him with a distraction, picking up the victory. The SmackDown! roster comes out, and celebrate... But lights go out, Undertaker returns, and cleans house.

Good match that had good wrestling, but an undesirable ending.

RATING: 83/100

Melina vs. Trish

Good diva match, and one of the best that I have seen. These 2 did really well and Melina showed some wrestling in the ring.

RATING: 70/100

Teddy Long vs. Eric Bischoff

Nothing much here, I agree with the crowd chants of boring, and it shouldn't have been on the card.

RATING: 40/100

Triple H vs. Ric Flair

Great match that was very brutal and good length. I would have liked to have seen the sledgehammer ending come with a little more painful shots, but still very good.

RATING: 88/100

Angle vs. John Cena

Disappointing match that had only a few minutes of actual wrestling as most of the match revolved around the referee scenario. Obviously also the winner was undesirable.

RATING: 75/100

Smackdown 5 vs. Raw 5

Very good match that had some good teamwork by Smackdown and some clever ways to eliminate people making them still look strong at the end. Good comeback with HBK at the end. I also loved the return of Undertaker after the match.

RATING: 88/100

74% - Great PPV that was comprised of mainly great matches. The downfall was the match of the GMs which should have never been on the card in the first place.",1135036800,,1251,4.558558558558558

What the F..k?......... so that means that anybody can be a WWE champion nowadays?..........at least Batista have some muscles  that makes him look like a real wrestler, but this John Cena guy is just nobody really...........  I don't know what is wrong with the WWE , I think Vince really deep inside wants to get rid of this nobody too, but I don't know what is he waiting for......... I think the champion should be anybody in the roster but him.......

70-76 (D- One okay bout or two)

77-84 (C- Good solid show worth the money)

85-92 (B- Very Good should add to collection)

93+ (A- A must have for any fans)

The 1st match of the best of 7 series for the United States title- Chris Benoit vs Booker T- I was unsure how they were going to use this bout but it turned along to be a very solid match. It starts out kind of slow but what can you expect when there are only 5 matches on the card. Chris does his normal offense with suplexs, Germans, ect. Booker T goes 1-0. Match Rating- 8

Trish Stratus vs Melina Women's title- Nothing good. All womens wrestling sucks. So just press skip. Match Rating 2

Last Man Standing Ric Flair vs HHH- I think this was the best last man standing match in history. HHH carried Flair so good Flair looked great. There are plenty of spots like backdrop threw a table, double a spinebuster on the ground, and HHH got Flair with a screwdriver. It took three pedigrees to put Flair out for the ten count. Match Rating 9

Wwe title Kurt Angle vs John Cena- Why would you hate Cena when he puts these great matches with Angle. I loved this match and other people hate it. Cena takes a hard Belly to Belly suplex on the floor. Davari gets hit by Cena and a new refree comes in and gets the three count for Cena. Match Rating 9

Eric Bischoff vs Teddy Long- This and the women matches were the only matches I really thought they could replace. So press skip.

Boogeyman interferes and gets Teddy Long the win. Match Rating 1

Team Raw vs Team Smackdown- The match of the night. These matches are so good and always put you on the edge of your seat especially when your favorite wrestler Randy Orton (mine) at the end picks up the victory for team Smackdown with the Rko on Shawn Micheals. Best 5 on 5 Survivor Series match ever. Match Rating 10

Then when Randy is celebrating with all the Smackdown locker a casket comes out and its caught on fire and the Undertaker comes out, Randy gets out of there and he takes out the whole locker room. This sets up the Hell in a Cell match for Taker and Orton.

According to my ratings Survivor Series 2005 gets a 92. Its a B+. The only thing they could have done is replace the Teddy Long vs Eric Bischoff with a different match possibly the Wwe tag titles like MNM vs LOD vs Mexicools. Now that would have made this a Perfect PPV.",1134259200,,2397,4.218818380743983
2390239,3,B000AOEPUM,"Define irony: a few reviews down, a guy criticizes Cena fans' linguistic skills and manages to misspell ""grammar"" in the same sentence. You people certainly aren't bolstering the reputation of wrestling fans.

Now then...the only point on which I can agree (to an extent) with previous reviews is the Cena/Angle/Michaels match. I agree that Cena is far less deserving of the championship than either Michaels or Angle, but consider this: you people complain about Cena as champion, but you also complain that the WWE has become predictable and redundant. How can that be? The very fact that Cena and Batista escaped the Survivor Series with their titles is a significant milestone that goes directly AGAINST your accusations of predicability. Look at the list of people who have left WrestleMania as a world champion:

XX: Chris Benoit, loses to Randy Orton in August

XX: Eddie Guerrero, loses to JBL in July

XIX: Brock Lesnar, loses to Kurt Angle in July

XIX: Triple H, loses to Goldberg in September

X-8: Triple H, loses to Hulk Hogan in April

X-Seven: Steve Austin, loses to Kurt Angle in September

XV: Steve Austin, loses to Kane/Undertaker in September

XIV: Steve Austin, loses to Kane in June

XIII: The Undertaker, loses to Bret Hart in August

XII: Shawn Michaels, loses to Sid AT SURVIVOR SERIES

XI: Kevin Nash, loses to Bret Hart AT SURVIVOR SERIES

X: Bret Hart, loses to Bob Backlund AT SURVIVOR SERIES

IX: Hulk Hogan, loses to Yokozuna in June

VIII: Randy Savage, loses to Ric Flair in September

VII: Hulk Hogan, loses to The Undertaker AT SURVIVOR SERIES

VI: The Ultimate Warrior, loses to Sgt. Slaughter in January 1991

If you know anything about WWE history (as I obviously do), Cena's title victory at Survivor Series should have come as a GREAT surprise. He and Batista are the first world champions in 15 YEARS to run from WrestleMania through Survivor Series as champion. Do your homework, people, and shape up.",1134259200,2,1944,4.875

i would prefer Funaki or Spike Dudley to be the WWE champ over John Cena, not even talking about those who deserve like HHH or HBK. It would be great to be Ric be the champ once again.

For those f*cking stupid people who like John Cena: JOhn cena won the match at taboo tuesday with a stupid FU. Thats kinda funny because Shawn Michaels can kick out of a angle slam from the TOP ROPE, and he cant kick out of an FU ???????

As for gm vs. gm, since their jobs are not on the line their is no point of this match, but I'll still vote for Long to win.

Last Man Standing, I like the nature boy and I truely believe he has been revived in recent months, but he will lose to the game in this one.

Women's title, Smackdown only has 5 divas and only 3 of them are active wrestlers so I'll be pissed if the women's title is wasted on sd becase of their weak women's division. GO TRISH!!!

Booker vs. Benoit, I will definately be pulling for Benoit in this match.

RAW vs. SD, this is definately the most anticipated match of the card and there is so much pride not only for the wrestlers, but for the fans as well. I'm a RAW and I will until the day I die so I'll be pulling for them, but I just have a bad feelinmg sd will come on top.

2390258,5,B000AOEPUM,"I have already seen some spoilers so I kind of know what matches are going to occur. Here is my prediction:

1. WWE Championship (John Cena vs. Kurt Angle):

Man, what the hell is it going to take for WWE to get off its @ss and let Cena lose? I hope they do it here but they most likely will not knowing them. Plus, I would really love to see how Kurt Angle would be as a RAW world champion.

Winner and new WWE champ: Kurt Angle

2. US Championship (Booker T vs. Chris Benoit):

Kind of hard to call, but if I know WWE they are not going to let a champion like Booker T only have a title reign only a few weeks long. Besides, Benoit is way better than this, he should be going for the World Heavyweight title.

Winner: Booker T

3. World Heavy Championship (Batista vs. Eddie Guerrero):

I like Batista, he is a really great wrestler and nowhere as near as annoying as Cena. However, he too has been here forever and there is noway that I am not going to see Eddie Guerrero come out as World champion after one and a half year of staying in the dark.

Winner and new World Heavyweight Champ: Eddie Guerrero

4. Undertaker gimmick match (Undertaker vs. Randy Orton):

I hope it is a buried alive match. Randy has won too many times, I just don't see him winning 3 times in a row against the Undertaker. I predict that the Undertaker will get him in the hole and get the victory but Bobby and a surprise ally (Ken Kennedy, perhaps?) will beat the Undertaker to a pulp, get Randy out of the grave and bury the Undertaker instead.

Winner(legally, not who stands tall at the end): Undertaker

I don't think this match will happen but I want to see it happen:

Intercontinental Title (Ric Flair vs. Triple H): Last Man Standing

I want to see a Last Man Standing Match because ever since I saw Fully Loaded 2000 I have since wanted to see Triple H in another Last Man Standing. Only they should make it a classic, way better than his match against Shawn Micheals and almost as good as the one with Jericho. I see both men beating each other senseless and Triple H pedigreing Ric Flair and then fall unconscious but rise back up with only 2 sec left. SHould be a very gory match. I expect Trip to say that the IC title is crap to him and rip it in half.

Winner (and new IC champ): Triple H

5. GM battle: Eric Bischoff vs. Teddy Long

I see Bischoff finally making good use of his black belt background. I wanna see a street fight and I want to see him beat Long to a bloody pulp with a gong before disposing of him. I expect Long to get the absolute crap beaten out of him. The reason I say this is because you DO NOT SCREW WITH ERIC BISCHOFF!

Winner: Eric Bischoff

6. Raw vs. Smackdown: Survivor Series match (Shawn Micheals, Chris Master, Big Show, Carlito, and Shelton Benjamin vs. JBL, Rey Mysterio, Ken Kennedy, Christian, and Hardy)

Just for entertainment sake, whoever wins this match gets immunity for them and their GM for a year, while the team that loses not only isn't immune but their GM gets fired and they can be released by the other GM anytime in the next year.

I see an epic matchup. It is hard to call this one, but a few things make it easier. First Smackdown is 2-0 against Raw and has somehow gotten the upperhand on Raw on almost every encounter. Second, no one SCREWS WITH ERIC BISCHOFF! If Bischoff wanted to destroy Smackdown he could've done it a long time ago. I expect Shawn Micheals to be knocked out by JBL's clothesline from hell, and then out of nowhere Triple H appears with the sledgehammer and busts JBL face first with the head and it instantly becomes bloody red. Then expect to see him do the sledgehammer drop and then swing it and break the man's ribs. THen he grabs Shawn Micheals then throws him on top of JBL and escapes before the replacement referree gets to the ring and counts the 1.2.3, RAW wins. As for postmatch I expect the Raw team to come back down and annhilate JBL and Bischoff makes a proclamation such as: ""You thought you had me beaten, didn't you, Ted? As you lay watching from your hospital bed, seeing my victorious brand in the ring and your ""wrestling god"" a lifeless heap that you remember one thing: Raw is and will always be the greatest brand in sports-entertainment because of me: Eric Bischoff! I shall enjoy seeing your show crumble!"" THen they show the EMTs coming out and the Raw stars clear the area as JBL is wheeled out.

8078991,5,B000AOEPUM,"1.) Best of 7 Series/Match 1 United States Championship Match: Chris Benoit vs Booker T

- A pretty good solid match to open Survivor Series with. A little slow at times but it was overall a good match to kick off the show. Booker T wins match 1 with a roll up and uses the ropes for leverage

2.) Women's Championship Match: Melina vs Trish Stratus (c)

- This was Melina's first shot at the big leagues in WWE, getting her first crack at the Women's Title and Trish Stratus. Melina is a pretty good wrestler so she and Trish were able to make this match work without having Trish carry her throughout. A little bit of outside interference from Mercury and Nitro, lead to their banning from ringside. One Stratusfaction later and Trish retains the title

3.) Last Man Standing Match: Triple H vs Ric Flair

- This match gets real brutal, real quick and is nothing more than an execution of Flair. Like Jim Ross would say, Triple H takes Flair to the woodshed in this great match which I would consider match of the night, right behind the main event. Triple H completely brutalizes Flair throughout the match and even bloodies him with in minutes of the match. A few weapons used throughout the match are a kendo stick, screwdriver, steel chair, steel steps, microphone, and the sledgehammer which gets referred to as ""The Great Equalizer"". Triple H wins the match in a very brutal way that must be seen. The commentators feel so bad for Flair they refer to the beating he took as Triple H putting Flair ""out of his misery""

4.) Special Guest Referee WWE Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs John Cena (c) with Daivari as the Special Referee

- This match was okay but nothing special like their other encounters they had over the years. John Cena ends up knocking Daivari out and gets the win with an FU on Angle after a Smackdown referee interfered and made the pinfall

5.) Raw GM vs Smackdown GM: Eric Bischoff vs Teddy Long

- A filler match that wasn't worthy of being put on PPV let alone being viewed by anyone. The Boogeyman makes his PPV debut, attacks Bischoff, allowing Teddy to win the match. Just skip past this match, it's not worth sitting through

6.) Traditional Raw vs Smackdown Survivor Series Match: Team Raw (Shawn Michaels, Carlito, Kane, Chris Masters, and Big Show) vs Team Smackdown (Batista, Rey Mysterio, JBL, Bobby Lashley, and Randy Orton)

- This match was exciting and entertaining to watch from beginning to end, featuring Raw and Smackdown's top best superstars battling it out to prove their brand was the supreme brand. At some points during the match it becomes hard to focus on because the commentators are busy screaming at and arguing with each other about stuff. This was a great match with great performances from every superstar involved in the match

The end comes with Smackdown coming out on top and the enitre Smackdown locker room coming out to celebrate but the celebration is cut short when The Undertaker returns and makes his presence felt among the Smackdown locker room

Overall: A very good Survivor Series with excellent matches and entertainment value throughout the night. The only exception was the unnecessary Eric Bischoff vs Teddy Long match. Other than that, Survivor Series 2005 was awesome and a recommended buy to add to your collection",1372982400,,3300,4.708333333333333
8078992,5,B000AOEPUM,"1. Chris Benoit vs. Booker T Match 1 of best of 7 for U.S Title: This match was a great opener. Two big stars going at it in a big rivalry. This match had great mat wrestling, dives, and interference.
2. Trish Stratus vs. Melina: This will not be the first Smackdown vs. Raw match you will see in this show. This match had a great story to it. The match was decent divas match. It was funny when Melina's tag team partners were thrown out of ringside.
3. Ric Flair vs. HHH Last Man Standing Match: This was one of the best Last Man Standing Matches I've seen. So many weapons were used, lots of hardcore moments, and a great way to end a big feud.
4. John Cena vs. Kurt Angle Special Guest Referee for WWE Title: I know what your thinking how could John Cena win this match. Even Eric Bischoff (Raw General Manager) said he would screw Cena. This match was another good match between the Angle Cena feud. This match had great match wrestling and many Referee changes if you know what I mean.
5. GM vs. GM Teddy Long vs. Eric Bischoff: This match should've never happened. Even if both these guys hated each other, but the ending had a surprise to it.
6. Team Raw vs. Team Smackdown Classic Survivor Series elimination match: This match was the one I was looking for. I was a big fan of the Raw vs. Smackdown feud.

Not the best Classic Survivor Series Match I've ever seen. It still was fought very well. Lastly, my favorite team won as well.

Overall: When I looked at the matches on this card I got it Right away. This dvd did not disappoint me at all. Especially Last Man Standing Match and the Classic Survivor Series Match.

8078995,4,B000AOEPUM,"Survivor Series was a positive event that hosted from Detroit. It had a solid card with one bad dud that really didn't belong here. The only negative about this event is the bickering between the Raw and Smackdown announce teams whenever they would call a match together. Other than that, this is a good ppv.

1. Match 1 for the U.S. Title
Chris Benoit vs. Booker T w/ Sharmell
This opener was quite good and one of the better matches of the night. They have had better before. This match was very competitive. Downside was only when Sharmell interferes towards the end but very good first match of the series. 4/5

2. Women's Title
Trish Stratus w/ Mickie James vs. Melina w/ Nitro & Mercury
We haven't seen much of Melina in the ring up to this point but she looked really decent in there compared to trish. Nitro and Mercury gets ejected early in the match. Trish mostly keeps this match good to watch. Pretty strong match from the divas. 3.5/5

3. Last Man Standing
Ric Flair vs. Triple H
For those who does not believe Flair can still take a viscious beating, than you need to see this match. Even though flair gets beat down for majority of the match, he still comes back strong and sticks it to the game. flair gets very bloody. This was a great match but I enjoyed their cage match from Taboo Tuesday more. Match of the night for me. 5/5

This is the part in the ppv where Edge and Lita debuts the ""Cutting Edge"" and starts to degrate the city of Detroit. Truly a segment only for the Rated R Superstar.

4. WWE Title with Diavari as the referee
Kurt Angle vs. John Cena
This was a huge let down for Vince McMahon. Vince tryed so hard to get the fans to cheer for Cena in this match by putting Angle with Diavari but the fans totally shoved it back into Vince's face. The fans was very electric in this match and mostly behind Angle. It was kind of cheesy with all the referee's coming out. Angle and Cena had a good match with what they were working with. Their match from Unforgiven I felt was better though. 3.5/5

5. Eric Bischoff vs. Teddy Long
This match of course is the dud. It was purely for entertainment value and nothing else. I did find this match very entertaining. Boogeyman comes out and makes his debut in this match. Entertaining but really aint worth rating.

6. Smackdown vs. Raw Survivor Series Elimination Match
Team Raw- Shawn Michaels/Kane/Big Show/Carlito/Chris Masters vs. Team Smackdown- Batista/JBL/Rey Mysterio/Bobby Lashley/Randy Orton

This match was more annoying to watch than anything. Tazz and Michael Cole would not shut up for the sake of the fans viewing. They would try and try to talk over the King, Joey Styles, & Coach where it got to the point you didn't care about the match, you only hoped the arguing would stop.

This was traditional Survivor Series rules of course. The younger guys would expectingly get eliminated first and leave the fight to the higher and superior guys. It got better once it came down to 3 on 1. Orton and hbk did a good job. The endig would lead to the return of the Undertaker where he would go after orton and beat up the ""B"" team of the smackdown roster to set up his match with orton at Armageddon. If you shut out Tazz and Cole, this is a very good Survivor Series match. 5/5

Survivor Series is one i recommend. I just hope we do not ever see another smackdown vs. raw survivor series match again.",1224374400,,3382,4.449111470113086
8078996,3,B000AOEPUM,"Each Survivor Series we see less of the traditional elimination matches that made this PPV fun to watch. This years event had a few highlights but a really weak main event.

Booker T VS Chris Benoit: Good match but they've had better matches in the past and in this series.

Trish VS Melina: Yawn

Triple H VS Ric Flair: Triple H was very believable in this match for some reason. This two put on an excellent last man standing match but I hated the ended. The only real reason to see this PPV.

Kurt Angle VS John Cena: WWE wanted Cena to be Hogan like so they put him over better wrestlers. Kurt Angle was just one of the wrestlers to suffer the Cena syndrome. Too bad for Kurt, although I hate him now in TNA. Not because he switched to TNA, because he is on the Impact show every ten minutes and its really annoying.

Eric Bischoff VS Teddy Long: Really...come on. I know the theme is Raw VS Smackdown but they could have done something better then this. Right now its shaping up to be one of the worst PPVS of the year.

Raw VS Smackdown: It says 37 minutes left. Too bad the action starts at 24 and the match slowly drags. I liked the heels and babyfaces as a mixed team; Its good Smackdown won but the match was stupid. The commentary during the match was pretty amusing though. Undertaker returns after this and Ortons nearly craps himself.

One of the worst PPVs of the year. Only reason to see it was Ric Flair-Triple H last man standing match or if your a fan of seeing the Undertaker returning after a vacation.",1197331200,,1523,4.304195804195804
