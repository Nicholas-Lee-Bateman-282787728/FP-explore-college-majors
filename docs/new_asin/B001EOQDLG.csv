8299090,5,B001EOQDLG,"The first thing that struck me about THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is that Timothy Dalton could act and he took the part very seriously and wanted to inject the full gamut of emotions into Bond. I think THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS is one of the better James Bond films for this reason. I think this film was the best since ON HER MAJESTY's SECRET SERVICE. I liked Timothy Dalton's interpretation of James Bond, the James Bond he gave us in this film, THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS. He was not the hard edged civil servant but more of a thinking man's blunt instrument as he demonstrated his reluctance to get the job done ""their"" way as opposed to ""his"" way.

John Barry delivered his last 007 score and it is one of his best at least in my humble opinion. I also enjoyed a-ha's rich and lyrical theme song played over Maurice Binder's main titles, which are very reflective. The instrumental versions of this theme strewn throughout the film tap in on Bond's dedication to get the job done and effectively enhance his drive in these scenes. This was also the last Bond film made during the actual cold war. We see a much more intelligent British agent discern that the KGB is not made up of a bunch of hoodlums but instead it is actually headed by an equally intelligent counterpart to ""M"" and the like. The dark yet richly colored photography and locations bring back much of the feel of the earlier Bond films.",1335052800,,1388,4.507936507936508
