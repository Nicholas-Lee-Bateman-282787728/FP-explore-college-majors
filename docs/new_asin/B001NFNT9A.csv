8545385,2,B001NFNT9A,"""I have rode through many lands for 10 long years.""  Yes, Frank Latimore says that in this movie.  It is confirmed by the closed captioning.  I know that this movie was made by Italians but those who dubbed it obviously spoke English and some, such as Latimore, were American.  One would think that at least a few would have some inkling of grammar.
This 1959 Italian made movie begins the same way so many American B (and lower grade) westerns began - the hero, Latimore, saves a lady on a runaway horse.  She turns out to be the lady who has waited for him through those ""10 long years.""  She must have been about 12 when he left.  The ""lovely barmaid"" he remembers must have been even younger.  About 12 minutes into the film, the villain has one of his henchmen say 10 or 15 not particularly cross words to entice Latimore into a duel.  Just in case you forget which is the villain and which the good guy, the villain wears black, including a black cape.  Latimore of course wears white and a white cape.  The plot and characters go down hill from there.
I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.  The picture quality on the streamed movie is poor but watchable.  However, Amazon & Amazon Prime have so many other swashbuckling movies available, that I recommend watching some of those and skipping this one.",1460419200,,1342,4.473251028806584
8545386,2,B001NFNT9A,"This is an awful VHS transfer to DVD. The picture is murky, muddy and alternates between dim and bright while the sound quality in badly dubbed.
I do not recommend anyone to purchase this tripe.",1238544000,2,194,4.571428571428571
