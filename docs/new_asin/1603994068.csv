7800196,5,1603994068,Excellent condition.  The show is garbage but that's why I bought it - to laugh at the ridiculous plots of each episode.,1409702400,,120,4.454545454545454
7800197,5,1603994068,"C.O.P.S Volume 2 continues the exploits of Empire City's most wanted and lovable, bumbling criminals in their schemes to gain a quick buck.  Always ready to save the citizens of Empire City is the Central Organization of Police Specialists, C.O.P.S.  The C.O.P.S are equally as lovable as the crooks of Empire City.  This volume was as good as the first, but I wish they would have added the C.O.P.S PSAs like the first volume had.  Can't wait to get the third volume!!!!!",1375660800,,472,4.719512195121951
7800198,3,1603994068,"Not all of the episodes are there . Just as ""the lowest crime "" where the crooks team up with the cops to get rid of drugs in Empire City .  A crime that even Big Boss wouldn't touch .",1370390400,,184,3.6

7800200,4,1603994068,It came promptly and in the condition described.  Note: There is a different volume 2 that continues from volume 1.  This addition repeats 10-11 episodes from volume 1 and does not include the remaining episodes found on another COPS volume 2.,1357257600,,243,4.902439024390244

7800203,5,1603994068,"It has been 4 years since Volume 1 was released, but Volume 2 is finally on DVD.  This is a great DVD set featuring 21 more episodes of the animated series C.O.P.S..  The picture quality is as good as most other 1980s cartoon sets.  The audio is good too other than the episode, The Case of Mace's Romance.  The audio is such that if you are listening to that episode on surround sound the voice acting only comes from one speaker.  I don't feel it takes away from the episode much as it just takes a little bit to get used to if you were watching a previous episode with no issues.  Shout! Factory's Brian Ward said this was just a problem with the masters, so there is nothing they could do about that episode.  Besides that issue, this set is great.  The show brings back a lot of memories and still holds up well today.  If you want to see the series finished off with a Volume 3 release, I highly recommend buying this set.

Update:  According to tvshowsondvd.com, it looks like Shout! will not be be releasing a volume 3 and Mill Creek Entertainment will be releasing the entire C.O.P.S. series on DVD in two volumes in 2011.  Since Mill Creek puts a lot of episodes per disc, the picture quality probably won't be as good as Shout! Factory's releases, but at least we will get the entire series on DVD and for a cheap price.",1270857600,2,1331,4.32258064516129
7800204,5,1603994068,"It is about time Vol 2. came out! C.O.P.S. (Central Organization of Police Specialists) is a COPS show like no other. Sadly, it is an underrated show originally made to promote the toys. If I had it my way, I would've had the show continue even after the toys have been canceled and the toys made to be exactly like the characters as seen on TV and include Mainframe, Mirage, Nightshade, Brian O'Malley, Ms. Demeanor, and Mayor Davis. The show is awesome with unforgettable characters like Bulletproof, Mainframe, Sundown, Big Boss, Nightshade, Berserko, Rock Krusher, and Turbo Tu-Tone and unforgettable episodes such as The Case of the Sinister Spa, featuring Berserko as Mayor of Empire City, forcing the C.O.P.S. to do community service and Mainframe and Mirage being forced to do laundry at the crooked spa, and The Case of the Giveaway Gold featuring Highway's bad cookies that was used by Mace to foil one of Big Boss' criminal capers. They're all in there and lots more.

There are, however, 2 things on Disk 2 that's worth noting-- One is The Case of the Crime Nobody Heard as written on the box set package being replaced by The Case of the Boy Nobody Wanted in the DVD. This leads some fans to think that both episodes are one and the same, knowing that the series is known to contain only 65 episodes while I always thought these are two separate episodes and that there were only 66 episodes instead of 65. The way I researched on sites containing the list of C.O.P.S. episodes with one list containing The Boy Nobody Wanted and the other containing The Crime Nobody Heard, I have a feeling they could be right.

UPDATE: Brian Ward of Shout Factory have confirmed that there are indeed 65 episodes in the series. Thus, The Case of the Crime Nobody Heard and The Case of the Boy Nobody Wanted is in fact one and the same episode and that there are 65 episodes in the whole series. I rest my case.

The other is the audio in The Case of Mace's Romance that was not mixed well into a 2-channel mono mix like the rest of the episodes. Instead the audio on that episode has the voices coming from the left channel with some music on that track, and then the right has the majority of the music and the sound effects, so when you're playing it on a surround system, instead of having all the audio for this mono program coming out of the center speaker the surround system is processing it as a couple of surround signals and making the audio come out of all the speakers and sounding really hollow and echoey with the center speaker consisting mostly of overpowered sound effects drowning out the vocals.

Nevertheless, this should not stop you from going out and buying Vol. 2 box set and increase its sales so that Shout factory can released Vol 3 in a matter of months rather than years. It's all better than nothing and what's in the DVD box set is all awesome and all worth the wait. So go out and buy Vol 2 along with Vol 1 and increase their sales so that Shout Factory can indeed released not only Vol 3 but the Complete C.O.P.S. box set featuring all of C.O.P.S.! It's Crime Fighting Time!",1269388800,8,3106,4.4920353982300885
