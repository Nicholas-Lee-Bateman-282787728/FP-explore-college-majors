8318911,4,B001LNON58,"Typical early 60's West German-made, English-dubbed Edgar Wallace written crime mystery. A group of people are menaced by a mysterious assailant who give fore-warning by leaving a red circle as his calling card. Though filmed in West Germany the story is based in England and the German locales used fit the bill pretty good. I ordered a DVD-R (pictured below) and the quality is excellent. The black-and-white photography is crisp and clear. Recommended for fans of this genre.",1428278400,2,478,5.141025641025641
