4962153,5,B0066E6SSC,"I remember watching this program when it was still being aired new. Miss this. Sadly I can not watch this on TV, all the good shows are gone and replaced with junk. This movie brings back the good times of the Seavers. Only let down is no [CC] Closed Captioning on it. Need it for anything I watch due to being deaf. But I use my headphone for that. I don't let that damper my enjoyment of this movie of a 'family' that most would love to know or have. Waited ages for this to come out on DVD since never saw it on TV when it was aired.",1360972800,8,536,3.926605504587156
4962154,3,B0066E6SSC,This movie was a little harder to get into and I still haven't watched the whole thing.  Some of it is just a little too silly.,1357257600,,127,3.8846153846153846
4962155,4,B0066E6SSC,I enjoyed this movie - I bought it because I grew up watching growing pains and it was similar to the show.,1357257600,,107,3.909090909090909
4962156,5,B0066E6SSC,"Growing Pains was, is and will always be my favorite show on TV. So watching this movie just brings back a lot of pleasant memories, having grown up with The Seavers. Warner Bros, when will you release Season 3 (and all the other Seasons too, for that matter!)? We're still waiting!",1355443200,,282,4.549019607843137
4962157,4,B0066E6SSC,"The movies were just a bit too much. Does not have the same energy as the TV shows. Like I said in my other review, I lusted after some of the younger ones on the show, but they are now grown and married. The energy, the lust and what ever else is no longer there. Also, like I said in my other review of Growing Pains: The Movie, they should have included ""Boner and Eddie"".",1332374400,2,375,4.013333333333334
4962158,4,B0066E6SSC,"The Growing Pains Movie is just another movie for me. When I was in my teens I use to watch, like, and even lust after some of the younger people on the show. The movies are now out on DVD and most of the younger people of the show are now married. The lust for these younger people is no longer there. Also there are some of the people from the show that didn't make it into the Growing pains Movies. Such as ""Boner"" and ""Eddie"". It would have been nice to have included them in the making of the two movies. Oh, well.",1332374400,,519,4.0
4962159,5,B0066E6SSC,If you like growing pains the series you should like this movie. I really liked it when it was on TV a long time ago and haven't been able to find it on DVD. I was so excited when I found this :-),1330128000,2,196,3.5813953488372094
4962160,5,B0066E6SSC,"I was over the moon when I spotted this on Amazon! Though not the most intelligent of scripts, Growing Painds: The Return of the Seavers is warm, engaging, and most of all, it's just great to to see the entire ensemble on the screen again. The perfect fix to fill the empty spot they left when the series got cancelled. I just hope they now come out with the season 3 DVDs as I've watched season 1 and 2 so much, I practically know every episode word for word.",1328227200,13,460,4.179775280898877
4962161,5,B0066E6SSC,"Totally thrilled Warner Brothers was kind enough to release these films on dvd :)
Growing Pains Return Of The Seavers is a really fun, made for tv film and fans of the series are sure to enjoy seeing the Seavers again.
Is it as great as the series? Of course not. But it's 100 percent worth a buy and a must own to continue your Growing Pains dvd collection set. Nobody ever thought these would ever see a dvd release so it's a no brainer buy in my opinion.
Don't let the word Dvd-R turn you away. It's just not sold in stores :) only here on Amazon and on the Warner Brothers site. That makes it even more of a must buy.
One more thing fellow Growing Pains fans. We the fans are what keeps dvd's moving. We must support everything Growing Pains! Clearly the nice people at Warner Brothers are still at least interested in this series and if we continue to buy Growing Pains dvd's. Guess what? Maybe season 3 will be right around the corner.
This classic sitcom sure deserves every season released.

A fun movie.",1325808000,13,1012,4.326315789473684

4962179,2,B0066E6SSC,I'm most upset that this is not the original movie I viewed on television. There are scenes that were deleted that featured Ben's African-American wife who he met in the previous movie.

4962222,3,B0066E6SSC,"This Movie was fun to watch although it feels like they have completely forgotten about the first reunion movie.
The did keep some aspects from the first, but most of it is never mentioned.

They were some great jokes and references that made me smile.
It was great catching up with the Seaver family again.
The end was predictable but that's Growing Pains.",1370044800,,357,4.666666666666667
