8274764,3,B0019N5A98,"I misread the description.  I thought I was getting the low-down on the ant world, but instead I got this kinda highbrow monotony on this ant guy.",1442880000,,146,4.407407407407407
8274765,5,B0019N5A98,This video is a must see for all of you who love science.  E.O. Wilson has been a hero of mine since I was in high school many moons ago.  This is the one person I would love to sit down for a cup of coffee and I do not drink coffee (I would for Ed Wilson).,1377648000,,257,3.491228070175439

8274767,5,B0019N5A98,"Narrated by Harrison Ford, the Lord of the Ants wonderfully depicts important lessons from our minuscule co-inhabitors of this planet, ants.  It also provides background on one of the world's finest naturalists, E. O. Wilson.  He teaches important information on the biodiversity crisis that we face on the planet and outlines some of the things that need to change in order to save the earth's precious biodiversity.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in these issues.",1288915200,7,476,5.32
