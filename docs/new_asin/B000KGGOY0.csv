4518649,5,B000KGGOY0,I love Samantha Brown and am delighted to see that this series is available. Sam takes you to all the important places to see in her travels and makes her shows interesting and entertaining.,1373846400,,190,4.617647058823529
4518650,5,B000KGGOY0,"Great programs for the whole family!
Enjoy all viewing of sites.
Very family friendly!
Love Samantha Brown's input on many things, her comments, ideals, etc.",1373328000,,157,5.32
4518651,5,B000KGGOY0,I like how Samantha covers very subtle details about the local customs that are very accurate. She has a good sense of humor and really seems to enjoy the trips which makes her fun to watch.,1372982400,,190,4.305555555555555
4518652,5,B000KGGOY0,"As you might know from some of my ""other"" reviews-- I'm a Time Traveler from the year 2077.  I can vouch for this and one other programme being essential in getting me up to speed on modern culture of this era.  Take for example some time I spent in 1805 Paris, France.  I was just minding my own business having some wine and cheese in a lovely little park when dashing through and ruining my good time was Napoleon chasing after some kid who slept with one of his sisters.  I did manage to help the pour kid, by dragging him into the time machine and sparing his neck from Napoleon's sword.  Sadly when we landed I missed Paris by a bit-- turned out to be Virgina in 1745.  Anyway the kid told me that he'd change his name and try to make something of himself, gave himself a cool sounding English name-- that my friends is the last time I ever saw teenage George Washington, sometimes I wonder what became of him.",1372982400,,916,4.265895953757226
4518653,4,B000KGGOY0,Samantha did a good job introducing cities and sites to see.  I love all the food and places she goes.,1369180800,2,102,4.1
4518654,1,B000KGGOY0,"I love Samantha Brown's travel episodes - wherever she goes - and have watched as many as I can find. I have no complaint about her quirky presentation style and abounding enthusiasm for everywhere she goes.

My complaint with this DVD is it only contains one 20 minute episode for the money. I was extremely disappointed to find only one episode on this DVD when another DVD (Passport to Europe - France & Italy) not only contains the Florence episode but 7 others for the same price. Don't get caught paying $9.99 for a single episode.",1285804800,2,537,4.59375
4518655,3,B000KGGOY0,"While a lot of sights are viewed in this video, it would be better if more time were spent on the city and its surroundings rather than a hotel room.  More in-depth coverage of sights (even if not in complete detail) would allow one to better appreciate the beauty of this city.",1284940800,3,278,4.346153846153846
4518656,4,B000KGGOY0,"This DVD is a great overview of Roma.  It is ideal for a first time visitor as it covers the highlights.  The other reviewer seemed to think it was not good for the first time visitor, but I'm not sure how it could be more general.  Also, it is a 24 minute television program that doesn't claim to be geared to the budget traveler, so I just wanted to refute the other reviewers comments as it is exactly what it claims to be...an informative travel dvd.",1233187200,4,454,4.255813953488372
4518657,2,B000KGGOY0,"This video contains very little information for anyone traveling for the first time to Rome, and it is made for people traveling with a big budget. No tips on how to save money.",1225065600,4,177,4.393939393939394

4518667,2,B000KGGOY0,"Enjoyed the different countries she visited. If you expect it to be a kind of  tour book with tips, prices, directions, etc you will be disappointed. But I don't think that's expected of a video. For that - one should buy travel booksb",1462924800,2,235,4.465116279069767
4518668,5,B000KGGOY0,"One of my all-time favorite tv shows. It was great to see it again. Makes me want to visit Munich so much more. Samantha is so genuine and real, very easy to watch!",1462233600,,164,4.0

4518676,5,B000KGGOY0,"My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that episodes are only 22 minutes long, leaving me wanting more. Samantha Brown's shows offer a nice contrast and complement to the Rick Steves' videos we've watched probably dozens of times. She sometimes goes places where he doesn't, which I find a huge plus. Plus Samantha is a lot of fun. I wish we had the opportunity to watch some of these before our recent trips to Ireland and Paris. And, some of her trips take place off season, which adds a whole other perspective as well.",1446681600,3,527,4.5

4518681,5,B000KGGOY0,"I adored this show back in the day. Informative,  silly and a treat to watch.",1437523200,,77,4.133333333333334
4518682,2,B000KGGOY0,I love Samantha Brown. She does such an excellent job hosting these travel videos. The reason I give 2* is it was absolutely ridiculous to have to pay to rent these videos. They are not in HD.  If I did not want to see the content of a couple of them (England and France) I would have never paid to watch them.  These videos should be totally free considering the poor quality of video.,1435276800,4,386,4.202702702702703

4518692,3,B000KGGOY0,"I'm a real fan of travel videos and after viewing tons of them, I've noticed that mainly Samantha's shows are mostly about ... Samantha.  It just feels like she inserts herself into her shows way more than other hosts.  Her shows on Austria/Vienna were not nearly as informative or attractive as Rudy Maxa's.  But hey, she's popular and people like to watch her so what the heck.  Just be aware that if you're actually planning a trip, her videos should be in your second tier of viewing (after Rudy and Rick Steves, along with Burt Wolf).",1420329600,3,539,4.583333333333333

4518699,5,B000KGGOY0,"I teach in a very isolated, rural community where a lot of my students are at the poverty line and may never get the chance to travel. I wanted to give them a glimpse of what cities were like in other countries to broaden their perspective. We watched a couple episodes and the kids loved it! Samantha is such a charming tour guide. The kids were so inspired! Great episodes and appropriate for middle schoolers.",1402704000,3,412,4.506666666666667

4518703,4,B000KGGOY0,Great travel show.  Would like to see it updated as most of the shows are close to 10 years old.,1396224000,,96,3.8
4518704,4,B000KGGOY0,Interesting show but in Low Res and some items mentioned are dated.  Needs a refresh and modern video to be up to date.,1395964800,,119,4.173913043478261

4518710,5,B000KGGOY0,"She is perky, she is funny, she is so girl-next-door, I love her to bits! I find this show very entertaining, as Samantha meanders through locales that I would want to go to myself, if only through TV. She's just like you and me, fumbling through foreign languages, wishing to understand the intricacies of other cultures but can't quite fully do so-- but it's okay! It's the journey not the destination. My only gripe is the show isn't long enough or that the Discovery Channel doesn't make more of these shows instead of the ones they currently have on...",1395360000,3,557,4.636363636363637
4518711,5,B000KGGOY0,"Samantha Brown is very funny and she gives lots of information for those who are planning a trip to Europe. She travels to places most of us just dream about and it is nice to be able to ""go""  without spending a dime or getting up off the couch! This season is from 2004 I believe, but I have just found it. Am looking forward to season 2. Season 3 (if there is one) is not available through Amazon Prime on my ROKU....wish it was. This season was very entertaining!",1395100800,3,466,4.177777777777778

4518717,5,B000KGGOY0,"Samantha's take on Naples, Italy is very balanced: there is reason to include Naples on one's itinerary. Whether its to visit family stationed at the American military bases or just curiosity about the city near Pompeii, there's much rich cultural and historical to appreciate in that city. She mentions the intensity, and cautions about the degree of independence of the Neopolitan can be exasperating. She failed to mention that most of the mosaics, frescoes and sculpture from Pompeii and Herculaneum are in the archeological museum: otherwise visits to those sights can be disappointing.",1394582400,,591,5.365591397849462

4518719,5,B000KGGOY0,While preparing for a spring trip to Europe discovered Samantha Brown's two seasons of travel videos.  This was the first time we heard of Samantha and were extremely impressed with her style of providing very helpful information when traveling.  She covered a lot of territory in both seasons and has a very pleasant way of pointing out the highlights of each trip.  Samantha has excellent taste and does an overall great job.,1394409600,,427,4.902777777777778
4518720,5,B000KGGOY0,We really like Samantha Brown's series. We're planning our first trip to Europe and this series at least gives us locations to consider. She always seems to have fun and one thing we're taking away is meet the locals.,1394323200,,217,4.589743589743589
4518721,5,B000KGGOY0,"I was looking for travel shows on traveling to Germany and came across Samantha Brown.  As far as I can tell, she stepped onto the scene after Rick Steves, but she's fun nevertheless.  She has a great personality and she knows how to have a good time. I enjoyed her tour of southern Germany.  Besides the drindl costumes, alfresco painted houses, and information about woodwinds, I loved that she was in Germany one second and in another country the next.  Too funny!

Samantha Brown is a hoot - sweet, gregarious, and fun personality!",1394323200,,535,4.709677419354839

4518725,5,B000KGGOY0,"Samantha just seemed to be having so much pleasure seeing Europe and meeting the locals in these shows. And since she tried to show us the character of each place (and its characters), the shows are aging well.

There was a time when Samantha Brown, Andrew Zimmern, and Anthony Bourdain each in their different ways were the faces of the Travel Channel. And made it a unique place in the cable TV universe. Of course that was back when the Travel Channel was a channel about travel. And not just another specter lost in Reality TV Hell.",1394064000,,536,4.525773195876289
4518726,5,B000KGGOY0,I love this show! I miss when the travel channel produced shows about world destinations instead of food programming. This show is great because if showcases cities in Europe in 30 mins.,1394064000,,186,4.84375

4518728,5,B000KGGOY0,"We find Samantha to be refreshingly natural and spontaneous, knowledgeable without being pompous.  She covers not just the more popular, touristy venues of a destination, but also the less well known but often more fascinating locales.  Her intelligence and sense of humor make each day's discoveries a very personal experience for the viewer.",1393718400,,343,5.452830188679245

4518738,5,B000KGGOY0,"This show provides 22 minutes of fun. I get to visit places I would otherwise in all likelihood never see. As a bonus, I am in the company of a delightful travel companion - Samantha Brown. Samantha's cheerfulness and enthusiasm make the trip a true pleasure, no matter the destination.

At least there's something always there and interesting that makes me happy!",1392681600,,351,4.8
4518740,4,B000KGGOY0,"Although Rick Steves gie you better travel hints and information - Samantha is a whole lot more fun to watch - laughing, goofy jokes, and a different style of restaurants are visited.

Before going, I'd watch both Rick and Samantha",1392422400,,231,4.775
4518741,5,B000KGGOY0,This is a great travel series. Samantha provides wit and humor as she travels with you to all the stops in Europe. It was wonderful to find so many of her shows on Amazon Prime,1392336000,,176,4.057142857142857

Season 1 seems to be my favorite and I will definitely watch this over and over again on my Prime Account.,1391558400,,326,4.274193548387097
4518747,3,B000KGGOY0,"Good, not great travel program.  Star Samantha Brown is a little too casual for my taste.  I prefer to see more of the city and less of the host.  Good photography, though, and Barcelona is a very interesting place.",1391472000,,215,4.461538461538462

4518750,4,B000KGGOY0,"I love Samantha Brown, and without her silly little jokes, it would definitely not be the same program. You can learn many little quirky facts about European cities. Some cities are definitely more interesting than others, but that is also because of my taste. Cities like London and Paris were given two episodes because there is just so much to cover! It's great if you are considering a European trip or just want to become more cultured.",1391299200,,441,4.740259740259741

4518760,5,B000KGGOY0,"Samantha includes all the main information a traveler needs to travel to the destinations.  She is respectful and polite to the hosts of the country/city she is visiting and clearly enjoys learning about other cultures and enjoys the people.

She shows you so many different places and in this show, it's all about Europe which happens to be my favorite continent to travel to! I highly recommend you watch this, I watch it all the time! The best part is that since I have Amazon Prime, (which I highly recommend you get too) I get to watch all of Samantha's shows! :)",1389830400,,475,4.471264367816092

4518767,5,B000KGGOY0,Samantha has a great on-screen personality. She has a certain navet that shows as she confronts both the challenges and delights of international travel. Her experience might put the less experienced traveler more at ease.,1389744000,,222,5.371428571428571

4518779,4,B000KGGOY0,We are planning a trip to Europe and wanted to get information before seeing a travel agent so we would know when and what direction to take our trip. She has a lot of good information that we never would have considered to see or save money. WWehave been watching quite a few of her shows now. She can be a little annoying a times (overly enthusiastic) but you get used to it and get into the themes and information she is sharing.,1388707200,,432,4.216867469879518
4518780,5,B000KGGOY0,"If you are planning on traveling to Europe, or happy to be at home viewing Europe through your screen without the inconvenience of customs, weather, being in a foreign land, Samantha Brown is the perfect guide and travel companion to show you around.  She is fun, low-key, knowledgeable and seems to know scenic sites to visit.  She is very appealing and enhances rather than dominates the landscape.  I love to get on the treadmill and walk to each of these tours.  They take just over 20 minutes.  Warning: you may get hungry seeing some of the food, but at least it's not there in front of you to tempt you.  A friend's 20-something daughter recommended this travel series.  So, it can appeal to all ages.  You learn a lot in every segment.  I can watch them more than once as each time you catch different details.  See the world with Samantha Brown.  It is great these are free to watch with a prime membership.",1388534400,4,916,4.524390243902439

4518786,5,B000KGGOY0,"I love Samantha Brown. She is warm, funny, goofy, unpretentious, spontaneous, and delightfully entertaining all at the same time. (And it doesn't hurt that she's real easy on the eyes, too! ;) She has that unmistakable flair for engaging the viewer and making them feel like they're part of her travels... as if they're right there with her. I don't have the wherewithal to travel to Europe but her Passport To Europe series is definitely the next best thing to actually being there!

Passport To Europe provides a lot of useful information. The staples include when to visit, where to stay (high season, low season for best hotel rates), how to get around, where to eat, customs (e.g. meal times), night life, and sources of information (e.g. cabbies, hotels, visitor centers).

The camera work is superb. Smooth panning and wide angle shots are very well done to capture the surroundings and ambience.

One point of criticism though is hotel recommendations tend to be geared towards the more well-to-do travellers. I would have loved if she made recommendations on budget hotels and B&B's as well. However, looking up budget accommodates is easy enough to do with travel guide books.

Overall, I love Passport To Europe, probably more than Rick Steves' series. I only wish each episode were a little longer than 22 mintues!",1387670400,,1326,4.95945945945946

This show goes beyond showing major tourist attractions by having the host engage in local customs.

She comes across as fun and really enjoying her travels and experiences. Which is what makes the show a joy to see. She also does well at exploring areas outside of the normal tourist attractions.

I cannot afford to stay in the places she stays in but I do get a feel for the area from her programs.  I have family in Europe so a lot of the places are on my radar to visit so her coverage helps me narrow down the places I want to go.  Love that she is into the food and culture as well for I like to experience those things as well.

4518823,5,B000KGGOY0,"Great segment; preparing for trip to Ireland and there were great suggestions on places to go. I like how she weaves local customs into the program, too.",1375228800,2,153,4.703703703703703

She's wonderful!  Can't wait for more Samantha Brown vacations!",1375056000,,160,5.666666666666667
4518825,1,B000KGGOY0,"This is an old show with a lifeless personality. Had I not been going to Prague, I wouldn't finish watching the show.",1374364800,,117,4.363636363636363
4518826,4,B000KGGOY0,"Samantha Brown is a personable host. Avoiding the monotone voice overs of many video travel guides, she comes across like a friend who has visited the sites and is sharing her tips with you.",1374105600,,190,4.617647058823529
4518827,1,B000KGGOY0,"This show did not show much besides the host's and her personality. Not that I dislike personality, I'd just rather have the info without the personal fluff.  I imagine that may be a selling point for others.  That's what makes the world go around.",1373846400,,248,4.613636363636363

8452002,5,B000KGGOY0,Passport to Europe is my all-time favorite travel show! I love that its about the actual travel and not just food. Most of the travel shows on TV these days are either incredibly boring or completely food-based. Samantha Brown is so much fun and down-to-Earth. She shows things you can do in every budget range also. Honestly... I wish there were a version of this show for every continent. If Samantha can't do it...I volunteer myself to host! :D,1493596800,3,447,4.670886075949367
8452003,4,B000KGGOY0,"Sam has exquisite taste, travels to desirable locations, and yes she does add some fluff to her shows, but she also includes lots of good info AND some good film footage of the destinations! Don't miss her shows, even though they've aired a number of years ago. Wish she'd do some updates on some locations and go to a few new places!!",1492473600,2,335,4.419354838709677

8452008,2,B000KGGOY0,"Pretty vanilla.  Really no point of difference as far as the show was concerned, and it falls short when compared to Steves and Bourdain.  The host had charisma and the production value as decent, but it's not worth actually paying for.",1483056000,2,236,4.7317073170731705
8452009,4,B000KGGOY0,"Would be even better if it were in widescreen HD, but the show was made before that technology was widely available.",1482278400,,116,4.571428571428571
