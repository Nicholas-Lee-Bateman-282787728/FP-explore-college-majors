1045014,5,6305534012,Finally Miaka can summon Suzaku...oops! It didn't work! A great volume with the exception that episode 26 had the WORST ANIMATION I HAVE EVER SEEN! Nice to have a volume with 4 episodes instead of 3. We're now halfway  through the series!,933552000,,238,4.666666666666667

7891185,5,6305534012,"I just want to say I have gotten other volumes in this series brand new, and way much less then this volume. Sorry not rare. 2 is more rare and I got a great deal on it, brand new as well-and way less than you sellers are asking for vol. 8. Not to many sellers on this one as well. I will purchase Vol. 8 elsewhere. All ready found it some place else. Ouch.....on the sellers selling vol. 8. on this site. Anybody that pays these prices on this Vol. is nuts-used or new. Just had to say something. I am not talking about the the collector one, but that is also a little high. I know about collectibles. 20 years worth. Good hunting. Still love Amazon.",1318032000,,651,4.133858267716535
7891186,5,6305534012,"As a fan of role playing games like the Final Fantasy series, it's no surprise I enjoyed Fushigi Yuugi.  It has everything a good series should have: memorable characters, a gripping fantasy story, romance, and an ending that leaves you satisfied (even if a little sad).

Volume 8 is the last in this entertaining anime series.  It sums everything up.  The end is inevitable, but one of the best I have ever seen.  It leaves you wanting more only because after 52 episodes, you grow attached to the characters and are sad to let them go.

I first watched Fushigi Yuugi on fansubs before it was licensed.  Only now am I collecting the DVDs.  I must say the English voice acting is not as bad as some made it out to be.  Still, I prefer the Japanese language track with English subs.  I also liked the artwork that came with the DVD.  A foldout picture comes with each volume.

My only complaint about the DVD is that the menu is cluttered and busy, and the font is hard to read.  Also, the picture quality is not as crisp as I expected for a DVD; it looks like VCD quality.  Still, for the price I paid, I feel it was a good deal.",1153699200,2,1129,4.264150943396227
7891187,5,6305534012,"Good-bye Tamahome was one of the best tapes in this near-God-like series. The relationship between Miaka and Tamahome always makes me envious, but this was the first time it ever made me cry. This tape is a must for all FY  otaku and a MUST-NOT for everyone who loves Tasuki. Poor guy, thank Suzaku  for Mitsukake. Everyone familiar with the series should know what that  means. Pay Hotohori his due, this tape proved just how wonderful he is, I  wish he'd get together with Noriko, he deserves some happiness...especially  after what he does.",946512000,,543,4.795698924731183
