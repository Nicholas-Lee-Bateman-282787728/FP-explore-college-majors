8421323,5,B004B3AHBY,"This is a wonderful movie for ""family night"" with superior production values-- well-written dialogue, an engrossing plot, and excellent acting by the child actors involved.  The story concerns three city kids who visit their cousin-- a boy who lives with his mother and father on a ""homestead"" in the wild bush country of Tasmania.  While the boy's father is away, the four children decide to journey into the wilderness of Tasmania, accompanied by the boy's mother, in search of a beloved cow that has escaped from the homestead during a fierce storm.  Along the way, they have many exciting adventures, culminating in their arrival at Devil's Hill, a creepy, mist-covered mountain with a spooky cave-- where the children are obliged by circumstances to confront and overcome their fears.  I was very impressed by the acting of the children; the director elicited from them performances that seemed natural and convincing-- not at all 'wooden.'  Because of the children's thick Tasmanian accent, one has to strain at times to understand the dialogue.  Also, several situations the children run into seem a little far-fetched, stretching credulity just a bit.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this film for parents who are looking for a clean, fun, exciting movie to watch with their kids.",1341360000,4,1290,5.173076923076923
