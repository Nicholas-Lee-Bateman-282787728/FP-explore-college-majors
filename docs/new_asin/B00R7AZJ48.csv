8694392,5,B00R7AZJ48,"This is a great video showing the Leopard style of Gung Fu.  You won't find a more precise training video on the market. GM Reggie McKissick is at the top of his art and shows each part of the form for you. They slow things down so you can see in detail the strikes and footwork. I hope this is the first of many more coming from Low Tiger Kuntao.  Of course, don't attempt these moves without some prior training and being in decent physical shape.  Thank you for making this video, I really like it!",1420761600,2,501,4.197916666666667
