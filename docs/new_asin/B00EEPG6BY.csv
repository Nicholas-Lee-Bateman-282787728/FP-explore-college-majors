8604803,5,B00EEPG6BY,"Really Good Dvd. The Sound Is Great, On Instruments And Vocals. This Concert Is During His High End Of Low Era, And Was A Little Different Then His Previous Shows. No Crazy Outfits, Or Weird Face Paint Just Straight Up Music. Twiggy Ramirez Is Also On The Guitar This Time Around And Not On Bass. I Give It A 5 Star Rating Cuz I Was Really Surprised To See This On Amazon And Especially For $4 that's An Amazing Offer. The Only Problem I Had With It Is He Didn't Play The Beautiful People?! I know, Crazy Huh. But Besides That Really A Good Show. Get It And You Won't Regret It :)",1420416000,,580,4.1415929203539825
