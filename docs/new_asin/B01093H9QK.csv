7306925,5,B01093H9QK,Well told story of a group of very old friends that have to deal with life-ending choices. Very funny and yet very sad comedy.,1442102400,,126,4.291666666666667
7306926,4,B01093H9QK,"The cover of the DVD of this 2014 Israeli-produced film proclaims (quoting the Huffington Post) Laugh-out-loud Moments!.  It shows a group of three men and two women (some of who are without clothing). I have to personally disagree with the quote and the image on the cover is one one-minute scene from this film, which bravely presents the moral dilemma of assisted suicide.  But that doesnt mean that Im not recommending it. The DVD will be released on September 22nd. I was provided a review copy for an objective review.

The duo who wrote and co-directed this film (which has a long list of producers at the beginning) want to add a touch of humor to a very serious subject and there are a few moments at the beginning that made me smile. But these are rare and, as the film progressed, I was drawn in the moral decisions that the characters had to make and watching people die in a hospital - no real spoiler here but thats the crux of the story  is not fun. There are some plot twists (though most are obvious early on).

All the main characters are said to be in their 70s but  to me they looked much older. Hours after watching the DVD yesterday, scenes from the film remained in my mind. The film is just 95 minutes but the images of the actors faces will stay with you.

This is a subject (what do you do when your loved one is in pain that cant be stopped and wants to rest in peace) that is important and how you feel about the ending will depend on your moral values.

There are no bonus features on the DVD.

I do have one concern about the production values. The dialogue is in Hebrew and there are English subtitles. But the letters are in white and are really small in size. If you are more that 4 or 5 feet from your TV screen you may have trouble reading them. There were times had to use the pause button to read them when the background was of low contrast. Maybe it worked better in a theater but I always feel that large YELLOW letters are the easiest to read.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

All of the actors are highly skilled and capable of conveying emotion with the slightest movement, glance or expression.  Just enough humor to carry the audience through the tough parts.  I showed it to a group and all reported discussing the message, assisted suicide for terminally ill family members in great pain, the next day.

7306938,5,B01093H9QK,"A funny, tragic, irreverent look at dying and people who are trying to help ease their suffering. Everyone should see it before they oppose medical aid in dying. The actors were so authentic -- fat, ugly, intrepid.",1461456000,,214,4.8108108108108105

7306940,2,B01093H9QK,"The film itself was thought-provoking--especially in terms of end-of-life decision making in cases of dementia as opposed to clearly defined terminal illnesses.

7306943,5,B01093H9QK,"A well-done, thought provoking look at issues regarding aging, infirmity and assisted suicide.

8721670,2,B01093H9QK,"The topic of euthanasia is handled poorly by depicting older seniors as
fools and victims of other people's schemes. A ""machine"" is devised to
help seniors commit suicide under the guise of helping them fulfill their
wishes to escape a painful and meaningless life when they should be helped
to face their destiny and draw pride and strength in their latent power to cope
with their difficult last days thereby offering others a model for the expression
of human courage, not human cowardice.
Aside from that the constant reloading of the film because of small bandwidth
of my web connection inspired me to beat a hasty retreat and an early end to
my own life of watching this video.",1533081600,,683,4.7478991596638656
