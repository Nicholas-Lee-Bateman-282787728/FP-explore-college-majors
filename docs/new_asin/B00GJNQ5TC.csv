6079962,5,B00GJNQ5TC,Awesome movie. Gripping...kept me on the edge  of my seat anticipating the next scene.  Unforeseen ending... movie should be turned into series.,1391126400,2,144,5.5
6079963,4,B00GJNQ5TC,"Though Luc Besson's name might be the most famous associated with Collision, it's really the brainchild of writer/director David Marconi. He's known for his films Enemy of the State and Live Free or Die Hard. His filmography leads audiences to expect a pretty complicated, action-oriented film full of twists, betrayals, and loads of double-dealing. In that way, Collision is a pretty typical Marconi picture.

Of course his style is a double-edged sword. If you're willing to go along with his plots, Marconi's films offer plenty of thrills. However, I'm sure there are those who had trouble following the internet-fueled plot of Live Free or Die Hard, with its many climaxes and scenes of exposition. The same fate befalls Collision, which is really several films in one. It's partly a romantic thriller, with the wife and lover trying to bump off the husband. It's partly a survivor-thriller, as a group of disparate people with something to hide are forced together by this desert collision. It's also a bit of an international/exotic thriller, as the Moroccan setting gets used to good effect for the film's climax. For some viewers that's going to be a bit too many changes of pace.

However, all of the individual moments are well-crafted. Marconi knows how to craft an action sequence, and no doubt the influence of Besson doesn't hurt things. There are plenty of thrilling moments sprinkled throughout the film. More importantly, the actors are all uniformly good. It seems like the idea was to cast people who are coming up, so Grillo and Bewley are taking a brief sabbatical from significant television roles, while Jaime Alexander is between Thor films. Perhaps the most established star is Roschdy Zem, though he's most famous in Europe. Together the ensemble really sells the sometimes overly twisty plot. It takes a lot to go from the small-scale tensions of a husband and wife to the large-scale tensions of a group with secrets fighting for their lives, but everyone here performs admirably.

Whatever one feels about the film, Collision (Blu-ray) is solid. The film's 2.40:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is excellent. Everything from close-ups on the actors to the wide desert vistas showcases a good amount of detail. Colors seem accurate, though a bit blasted by the Moroccan sun. Black levels are consistent and deep throughout. The DTS-HD 5.1 soundtrack is similarly impressive. We get clean and clear dialogue, but the real highlight of the track is the numerous action sequence. They showcase excellent clarity and dynamic range, along with pleasing directionality.

Extras start with a series of interviews with the major players, including Marconi, Grillo, Alexander, Zem, Marie-Josee Croze, and Moussa Maaskri. They're informative, though a bit fluffy. Luc Besson's inclusion would have been nice, but what's here is good. We also get a trailer gallery and an Ultraviolet Digital Copy of the film.

Collision is a fine enough film, the kind of thing that will get watched when nothing else looks good on Netflix some weekday night. It's not a life-changing experience, but those looking for a bit of international action will be satisfied. The fact that Collision (Blu-ray) is solid makes it easy to recommend the film for rental, especially for fans of the actors.

6079978,3,B00GJNQ5TC,Collision can affect vision and hinder the precision of a movie night decision and cause you to just wanna go fission or to mold clay pission with her crafting utensil instead of hission,1400112000,,186,4.666666666666667
6079979,3,B00GJNQ5TC,"I liked it overall but more so how it all comes together in the collision in the desert setting the stage for the storyline on to start to reveal itself. Jaime Alexander was a challenge for me but performed well, seen her come from the Rest Stop to Thor, but way to represent the SC, and was really taken by the ex-military/security guy character, had me going for a moment thought it was unfold in a somewhat different aspect. I was just simply wondering how it all was going to turn out.",1397088000,,489,4.326086956521739

6079981,1,B00GJNQ5TC,"Amazon disallows profanity  or racial slurs, in these reviews ,and rightly so, but its hard to write of this movie without resorting to some of that....many of my best friends are arabs and jews and italians except when they act in a film like this,,, madness cavorting about in desolute sahara lincoln highway in the dunes.., who would  make a movie like this??...ask amazon  for  your money back?  And 3 thousand more for mental danages.....",1395705600,,443,4.8533333333333335
6079982,4,B00GJNQ5TC,"{3.5 stars}

The first half-hour or so is intentionally confusing and rather draggy, but all that's going on becomes apparent throughout the rest of the film, which is well-produced with good, though not great, acting. A film without heroes, COLLISION may be too violent, gory, and grim for some tastes. It's also a bit too humorless and slow-moving to be called a ""thriller."" Still, the way it shows how the different circles of people and the supposed allies within the circles conspire and are at odds with each and every other is thought-provoking. The whole message seems to be that ""No one wins--or if anyone does, it's the wrong people in the wrong ways--when people conspire and connive over money, power, 'love,' etc.""

COLLISION also takes some risks in the way its entanglements untangle at the disheartening but strangely fitting end. As unsettling as it may be, this film is anything but predictable.",1391472000,2,913,4.96078431372549
6079983,4,B00GJNQ5TC,"The movie centers on different people involved in a multiple vehicle accident in the desert; and each persons desire for money and escape from the desert as quickly as possible.  The characters react quickly in the plot that has many twists and turns, that in the end is highly interesting and not seen in advance as possibly happening.",1391385600,3,336,4.793103448275862
8623810,1,B00GJNQ5TC,"I was never able to view the movie ,even in standard definition. Amazon continued telling me there was not enough bandwidth. I question this due tot the fact hat I have a 200 meg connection and I also connect to Netflix on the same connection without any issues.

Being a long term Prime customers I feel I should be credited for the cost of this movie.",1512864000,,353,4.348484848484849
