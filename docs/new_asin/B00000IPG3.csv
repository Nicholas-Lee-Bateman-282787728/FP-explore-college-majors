1227016,5,B00000IPG3,"I first experienced this amazing film on the silver screen. The small screen was just as good though. With interviews from Electronic music's best, from HardFloor and Afrika Bambataa, to the GrandDaddy of 'em all,  Karlheinz Stockhausen. Truly a blast, and must-see, for anyone who likes  electronic music in any of its various incarnations, or is intrigued by  this sort of thing. Just buy it!",950054400,5,394,5.030769230769231
1227017,2,B00000IPG3,"This film was a dissapointment to me.  It really took something away from my love of techno.
I tired of watching/listening to ""artist"" after ""artist"" try to wax philosophical, to floor me by saying  something deep and profound.
Much ado about nothing.",948585600,10,251,4.9523809523809526
1227018,5,B00000IPG3,This video isn't perfect but it's the best so far in covering the entire spectrum of electronic dance music.  It goes so far as to actually showing the Roland keyboard factory!  There's multiple interviews with legendary  pioneers from decades ago along with today's new artists.  There's coverage  of Love Parade in Berlin and various other raves.  Just about every style  of dance music is represented.  Drum and Bass and House probably got the  most attention.  It breaks down to the smallest components of electronic  music and how artists get and arrange samples.  It's a great introduction  to electronic music for those who don't quite understand it yet and a great  history lesson to those of use who already love it.,946080000,20,725,4.933333333333334
1227019,4,B00000IPG3,a terrific documentary on the effects of technology on current musical trends and ITS effect on modern day society and culture. all done with a bredth and width and a sense of history behind it.  highly enjoyable if a  bit short in its running time.,937094400,2,249,4.511111111111111
1227020,4,B00000IPG3,"I saw this movie (or documentary or whatever you want to call it) in the theater when it first came out and enjoyed it thoroughly. Not only did I learn some new things about the history and origins of electronic music,  but laughed my ass off at some of the intervies with the drugged out  derelicts that pepper the electronica landscape. Some of the more notable  interviews with FSOL (who hardly ever appear in anything anymore) and some  of the German jungle musicians were absolutely hysterical. There were also  really good interviews with many of the origional Detroit hardhouse gurus.  I'm not even mentioning DJ Spooky, Joey Beltram and a host of other great  musicians - there were quite a few - too many to remember. My only  complaint about the film is that it was rather short - I think just over  one hour. Nonetheless, it was worth buying in my humble opinion.",925171200,6,874,4.623376623376624

1227032,4,B00000IPG3,"Touted as the definitive work on electronica, the guys start talking and never stop. Though many interesting observations about the genre from its origins in disco to the influence of diverse races and cultures are effectively made, some questions receive scant attention.  For example, while there is an interesting scene which shows how the equipment itself is made by women, every performer interviewed, spoken of, or filmed is male which makes one wonder what that might be all about?",1101859200,9,488,5.177215189873418
1227033,5,B00000IPG3,"I am a big fan of this movie. Many reviewers are knocking the Dj's and people in the film, 'for trying to be philisophical'. If you are a fan of Electronic Music, and know that it is not all TECHNO, then you will enjoy this film. It is a nice way of helping people to understand where this form of music comes from.

For me it was nice to see the origins of some type of music, because while I am not a fan of Techno, I am a fan of Breakbeat and House Music. I do like Drum and Bass, but I am  not a fan of 'Drill and Bass"" or Hard House. It's all preferences.

Anyway, I believe that owning this movie is like owning an abbreviated encyclopedia of Electronic Music. It's a necessary addition to your electronic music collection. If you have any music intrest.. it will help you to appreciate this form of it, that much more.",1099612800,2,825,4.111801242236025

I expected this film to play like a Keyboard Magazine interview with the artists; detailing their influences, their gear and how they create their sounds. There's a lot of DJs standing behind turntables bobbing their heads, mere snippets of the new techno bands like Prodigy, only a passing mention of Kraftwerk and no mention at all of the Art of Noise. I was disappointed. If you want the real story of Techno check out History of Rock and Roll: Episode 10 - The Perfect Beat call me: therealpeperl@yahoo.com",1075593600,6,668,4.61344537815126
1227035,5,B00000IPG3,"""Modulations"" is a very fast-paced documentary about the past, present, and future of electronic music.  Because it is so condensed, lacks narrative voice-over, and features so many people, you'll be able to watch this one again and again and always discover something new.
Please do look past the very cheesy cover--it doesn't do justice to what's on the DVD.  While rave and commerical acts like Fatboy Slim do get covered, you'll also find great footage of Pierre Henry, Genesis P. Orridge, and Giorgio Moroder (how often do you get to put those three names in a single sentence?).",1062288000,20,584,4.948979591836735

1227039,4,B00000IPG3,"(Sorry about that header.) Ambitious and mostly successful overview of the  roots and branches in the modern electronic music scene. The film covers  quite a bit in just over an hour. The use of ""sound bite""-length  artist interviews seems to irk some reviewers; I think they are failing to  savor the irony that this is just the cinematic equivalent of  ""sampling"", after all. As in any similar collection of  interviews, artist comments range from the banal to the revelatory, but the  director gets credit for not allowing any concept to become too redundant.  This film edges out the very similar documentary ""Better Living  Through Circuitry"", by thankfully not inserting so many tiresome,  epileptic seizure-inducing scenes of people ""raving"". Highly  recommended for genre fans.",968716800,6,785,5.300813008130081

7911200,4,B00000IPG3,"This DVD was part of a collection of media chronicling the electronica genre of music, which included a soundtrack CD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modulations-Cinema-for-the-Ear-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B00000DBYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modulations: Cinema for the Ear (Original Soundtrack)</a>) and a book (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Modulations-A-History-of-Electronic-Music-Throbbing-Words-on-Sound/dp/189102406X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Modulations: A History of Electronic Music: Throbbing Words on Sound</a>). With all items together you get a pretty good history of the origins of electronic music as well as the various sub-genres that popped up during the 90's. The DVD alone is a worthwhile documentary with lots of interviews and details; even though it doesn't provide the full picture.

The documentary is LOADED with content. Tons of interviews as well. If you were in the 90's EDM scene at all you will find at least a couple of artists featured on this film. Here is a list of just the artists I know about that were on the documentary (* next to the interviews):

Afrika Bambaattaa*
Coldcut
Robert Moog* (Okay not an artist, but the biggest name in synthesizers)
Hardfloor
Moby*
Throbbing Gristle*
Jack Dangers (Meat Beat Manifesto)*
Orbital
DJ Spooky*
Westbam*
Photek
Armen Van Heldon
The Prodigy*
DJ Sasha
Future Sound of London*

That's just the artists I recognize, and it's only a fraction of the content. You get interviews with pioneers of various electronic music sub-genres. You get to hear the history and origins of subgenres like Detriot Techno, House, Gabber, Acid House and Jungle. You get observations on subgenres like ambient and DJ turntable skills. You get observations of the rave scene in comparison with the disco era and the drug counterculture. You hear about the influences of artists like Kraftwerk, John Cage, Donna Summer and more. There is a lot to soak in.

With the full load of information you also get a bit of chaos. The documentary is not organized in any recognizable fashion. It doesn't go through the history in any chronological order, and when it does talk history is scattered about the length of the documentary. Same goes for discussions on genres, recording techniques, musical influences, technology and so on. All of it is just unceremoniously tossed in a mixed salad kind of way. It's not bad in such a way where the documentary is hard to follow. Quite the opposite. Still if you are used to your documentaries having some sort of structure to it you may get put off by the somewhat frazzled form of presentation.

Modulations isn't the perfect electronica documentary, but it is definitely up there among the best. It's format can feel flustered at times, but at the same time it fits with the feel of the footage. If you have any interest in electronic music of any sort this is a good documentary to watch.",1388966400,,2963,5.5176211453744495
7911201,5,B00000IPG3,Modulation is a deep look into the past and present of sound and techno music. All Techno DJs should watch this dvd. This one is my all time favorite dvds that can be played every night and not get tired of watching it.,1197936000,,219,4.116279069767442
7911202,5,B00000IPG3,"I found this video very helpful in examining the history of electronic music.  Many of the electronic music styles such as House, Techno, Trance, Ambient, and Trip Hop were the focus of this video.  The video examined the history of the disco era and psychedelic music's contributions to the styles listed above. Many of the most established and recognized electro artists appeared such as DJ Spooky, Squarepusher, Kraftwerk, Afrika Bambaataa, Moby, Derrick May, Brian Eno, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Carl Cox, TG's Genesis Porridge, and Giorgio Moroder Chicory Tip.  In the historical references much credit is given to the classical composer John Cage and Pierre Henry and Pierre Schaeffer as well as Miles Davis.  There is discussion of the Moog synthesizer and its influence in electronic music.  I learned a lot of new information about the origins of electronic music, its sources, its inspirations, and what its pioneers have achieved and their ideas for the future of music.",1192579200,,978,5.243589743589744
7911203,1,B00000IPG3,"Ok, look at the cover of this DVD.  It says it all:

Limegreen wording.  An asian girl, with a purple-tinted face, wearing huge bug-eye glasses, big headphones over both ears. WHAT does any of this have to do with House/Techno/Drum'n'Bass, the 80's/90's Rave Scene, the developing music in Chicago and New York in the birth of Underground Dance  music?

Absolutely nothing.  Like most of the project, it plays to popular misconceptions of the electronic music scene (crazy teenagers having sex, high on drugs! Baggy pants! ""Drum N Bass was 'invented' because people did too much ecstasy, and needed darker-sounding music!)

It's an outsider's view, misinformed, fetishized, meandering.

-------
UPDATE:

If I could make some additional points:

==================================

A LITTLE ABOUT THE WORD ELECTRONICA

In the 90's, Underground Dance Music began making it's way into the mainstream in a way similar to its last head-rearing in the 1970's.  Disco was a popularized version of underground dance music, understandably despised for it's excess and apparent superficiality, just like we have today's popularized (read: diluted) versions.

In the 90's, a corporate entity called ""Billboard"" made a decision.  Now, understand, the people who work at Billboard are not musicians.  They may have taken guitar lessons when they were 15, but they not musicians.  They are accountants, marketers, executives, etc.  Necessary to society, but NOT to be confused with musicians.

They decided to come up with the marking name ""Electronica"" to describe certain styles of music gaining popularity in the 90's.  This taxonomy is based neither on musicology, extensive industry experience with the music, or anything beyond catchphrase convenience.  It unfortunately groups styles of music together that have very little intrinsically in common.  So here's your first bit of advice - people who use the word ""Electronica"" got into this game via a mainstream marking taxonomy.

Please let me make something clear: marketing is necessary to the sale of music - but it is not a path to learn about music.

==================================

Now get this.  We all know that DJ's, who comprise the largest group of electronic-media sound artists, play other people's records to create their ""sets"".  This means that record companies cannot publish a DJ set as their own entirely.  They have to authorize and pay for *every single record* that is played in a set (as opposed to one or two samples, which we find in hiphop/rap).  This means a very slim profit margin and a very complicated royalty distribution.  Companies don't like that, so DJ's, even GREAT DJ's don't get picked up by large labels.

But, there is still a lot of buzz surrounding this music, and now Billboard has branded a marketing catchphrase, so the major labels *tend* to sign and produce groups which create their own material entirely, but are frankly MEDIOCRE artists - generally speaking.  I'm not saying every non-DJ electronic artist is mediocre, but when an entire population of musicians is essentially out of marketable bounds - you're left with detritus.

Modulations is one of the business spin-offs from the spike in interest in electronic music in the 90's.  It is derivative, unoriginal, uninformed.  Enthusiastic, yes, but without focus or merit.  It is born of detritus.  Iara Lee has never had anything to do with any of these fields, and it shows in the documentary.  A recurring interview in the documentary is with a culture/fashion/lifestyle magazine writer.  You know, the types who can always comment, no matter how vapidly, on every subject.  It makes for nice sound-bites, and maybe an easier editing job for film production.  But... don't you want to learn what all this beautiful music is really about?

Her aesthetic and presentation of the disparate worlds of Underground Dance Music, the European avant-garde (and the deeply misguided implication of specific connections between the the two), electronic experimental, and all other turntable-based musics, for me, encapsulates the very essence of the very contrived word: Electronica.

Don't let the fact that they drop names of concert-music composers like Cage and Stockhausen impress you.  It's a documentary, not a cocktail party.

If this documentary amazed and inspired you to learn more about all the different types of electronic music - well, great!  It's serves some purpose.  But I would encourage you to drop any this sugar-candy edited-for-radio version and really go out to explore the good stuff.

7911204,2,B00000IPG3,"A disappointment.  I was hoping for extended selections of the artists' music, with maybe a little introduction/explanation.  Unfortunately, its mostly artist interviews droning on and on with only snippets of the music.  The artist comments are typically,  ""...its like everything that's noise can be music...but its like, uh, all about the technology...""  No real passion or insight until some more snippets of a rave flash briefly by.  Lots of subtypes of the techno music described, but its confusing how they differ for the lack of lengthy defining examples.  If you are a knowledgeable fan and want some camera shots and comments of your heroes, this may be for you.  If you want a clear introduction of the music and which artists may interest you enough to buy their music, skip it.",1149120000,2,790,4.977099236641221
