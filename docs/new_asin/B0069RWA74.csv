4980937,2,B0069RWA74,"I am not giving the movie the bad review, but I am giving how Disney put the DVD together itself a bad review.

I thought Geek Charming was a cute movie when I saw it and enjoyed it! I was surprised to learn that Sarah(not sure how you spell her last name:( from Modern Family was in this.

When I saw the commercial for the release, I was surprised to hear they are releasing 10 Shake It UP episodes on this DVD. Come on. Has Disney gotten so lazy with DVD releases that now they are deciding to release shows when they release a Disney Channel Original movie. Is that how it is going to be now? Whatever happened to releasing the shows on single volumes like they did with Lizzie Mcguire, That's So Raven, and Hannah Montana? Shake It Up should have its own DVD release and not be on this DVD. Maybe I can understand one but ten!? Also, why is Disney so anti-box set? After all the money they make, they should have plenty of enough money to release box sets of their shows. There shouldn't be any excuses. Plus, if they release box sets they would make tons of money from them, so I don't get the deal.

Overall, great movie, but poor DVD presentation.",1331856000,4,1155,4.264840182648402
4980938,5,B0069RWA74,"Being Mom of 5 children, it is rare to find a movie that all seem to like.  My kids range from 4 to 16 (boys and girls).  This movie was great!  Both the boys and the girls enjoyed it.  My 4-year old son loved Mouse!  The movie was well written and kept us entertained from beginning to end.  I hate to admit it but I even teared up here and there!  Definitely recommend this for your tween and young teen audience!  My girls say it is a ""must have"" movie for our home collection.",1329955200,12,480,4.031914893617022

4980953,5,B0069RWA74,"I think Geek Charming is a very cute movie. I really love the storyline a lot. It's a good story about looking beyond what you see above the surface. Sarah Hyland is a great actress and her personality as Dylan is very charming. No pun intended. I loved this movie so much that I just had to own it on DVD and I also really love Shake it Up so I actually applaud the bonus of 10 episodes. I think the price is very great considering these bonus episodes. In a way, it is like we get 10 episodes for free.

If you are someone who really loves Geek Charming and is also a fan of Shake it Up, this DVD is definitely a worthy buy!",1452902400,,626,3.9682539682539684
4980954,5,B0069RWA74,"Hullo, grown-up. Geek Charming may at first come across as generic Disney fare, strictly viewing fodder for middle graders and teenyboppers. But should you press on, you may find that it's a movie with some heart and some depth and a knack for possibly giving you the weeps, and that it's well-crafted enough that even us old fogies can hunker down and be entertained. It's a 2011 screen adaptation of Robin Palmer's same-titled novel, and I guess readers are beefing because the movie doesn't quite stay true blue to the source material? I haven't read the book so I can't speak about that. But I've seen the movie and I ended up really liking it.

The plot's not so fresh, been done umpteenth times before. Throw in, too, a whiff of Pygmalion. The conflict resides in that familiar high school conflict about popularity, that dichotomy between the cool versus the dweebs. ""I can't believe that popular people like me are forced to share the same air space as nerders like you!"" Yeah, that was blurted out by Dylan Schoenfield (Sarah Hyland), reigning queen bee of the upscale Woodlands Academy. She'd directed that slam towards Josh Rosen (Matt Prokop), a nerd what dwells near the low end of the school's social hierarchy. Josh couldn't care less about Dylan's opinion. He's an aspiring filmmaker and focused on winning the Puget Sound Film Festival, the prize of which is a coveted spot in a Hollywood filmmaking academy. But he requires brilliant subject matter for his entry documentary. His inadvertent dumping of nasty cafeteria food on Dylan's posh wardrobe is a bit of a godsend since it's not long after that he arrives at the notion of filming her efforts to win the school's Blossom Queen competition, his gateway towards an uncompromising expos about popularity. Dylan is down with being filmed since having a movie starring her earns her all kinds of publicity for her Blossom Queen campaign. But can the tactless, oblivious fashion diva and the grounded yet nerdy filmmaker co-exist? It's Disney, so, yes.

The first half hour or so of the movie, you may get super-annoyed with Sarah Hyland's character. Dylan sure comes off mean and vapid. But stick it out and the film gradually begins to reveal layers to her. This movie has stuff to say about not judging a book by its cover and that there are all the time real folks lurking beneath the cool facade. Dylan is one such, and as Josh keeps on digging, he learns the anguished truths of why she behaves the way she does - and then maybe you'll catch the weeps. Me, I liked Josh from jump - dude exudes instant likability and laid-back cool - but didn't much care for shallow Dylan. But Hyland's performance is so good and so achingly vulnerable and heartbreaking, it obliges me to have a 180 turnaround. The very neat thing is that it's not so much that Dylan has this epiphany or sudden personality change. Turns out, she's been this thoughtful and super-smart girl all along. She'd just been concealing her real self from everyone because, y'know, a world of hurt. We get a notion early on of how very lonely Dylan is in her extravagant home.

Other things I liked. I liked that Dylan and Josh's respective single parents are genuinely caring persons. So no annoying drama from that front. At no moment does Dylan or Josh act out against the 'rents. That's refreshing. And I liked it when Dylan confessed why she stopped hanging with her best friend years ago. It was so honest.

Note that it's impossible to not love that adorable giant Great Dane, Mouse.

In closing, I say that, yes, Geek Charming is predictable and ticks off a whole mess of Disney kid movie tropes. The plus is in the principals' acting and in the sharp execution of a ""predictable"" storyline. I feel that this is one of those feckless films that startles you with its strong beating heart and characters that strike a chord. I really recommend this.",1445731200,,3891,4.72459499263623

4980970,5,B0069RWA74,"Although there's nothing new in this film you haven't seen countless times before and the plot is very predictable, Geek Charming was done extremely well.  Fans of Modern Family such as myself's motivation is obviously to see Sarah Hyland as the lead in a full length movie, and she does a really good job of this. Granted the character has some resemblance to Hayley Dunphey on that show, but her character Dlyan in this one is more of an exaggeration of self absorbishness, spoilt rich princessesness and looking down her nose at those less cool than the Hayley character possesses.  The film geek is also well played by Matt Propok.  The film does suffer from the normal everything looks a lot cleaner than the real world schools, shopping mall and other destinations that are always present in teen character Disney films but you surely were expecting that going in.

The movie had a lot laughs and ultimately gives the life lessons you expect from Disney.  Well worth checking out.",1421020800,,986,4.810650887573964

4980996,5,B0069RWA74,"It's double the fun with Disney's double DVD release of the 2011 Disney Channel Original Movie ""Geek Charming"" and 10 episodes of Disney Channel's hit sitcom ""Shake It Up"".

""Geek Charming"" made its debut on November 11, 2011 and was watched by 4.9 million viewers, the fifth largest number for a cable show that entire week.  The film is an adaptation of Robin Palmer's book ""Geek Charming"" and is directed by Jeffrey Hornaday (""Shout"", ""Madonna: Ciao, Italia! Live from Italy"") and written by Elizabeth Hackett and Hilary Galanoy.

The film stars Sarah Hyland (""Modern Family"") as Dylan Schoenfield, a rich, spoiled, self-centered and popular girl at Woodlands Academy.  She and her friends love sporting the latest fashion but also dislikes anything that isn't cool.  Sarah's goal is to become this year's ""Blossom Queen"" and with her popularity, she hopes she can win!

One day, while Dylan and friends were going to eat lunch, film club president and fellow student Josh Rosen (played by Matt Prokop, ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"", ""Furry Vengeance"") accidentally runs into her and needless to say, all three girls get food all over them.

Sarah cries out that popular people should not have to be in the same school as geeks.

Meanwhile, Josh is in a lot of pressure as he needs to submit his film/documentary for the school's film festival.  After watching and observing Dylan, he decides to create a movie about the life of a popular girl and to explore if she's actually that shallow of a person.

Dylan is delighted to be a star of a film but sees it as an opportunity for her to get more votes and be crowned Blossom Queen.

As the two try to make a film, Josh is turned off by her diva-attitude as they both fight over who's move it is.  As Josh fires her, he eventually reconsiders when he finds out that Dylan had watched the sci-fi film ""Flight of the Navigator"".

Despite Dylan feeling that popular girls and geeks can't co-exist, like cats and dogs are too different, the two start spending more time each other while making the movie.  And that is when Josh starts to see the true Dylan, a teenager who is driven to win the ""Blossom Queen"" because her dead mother was also ""Blossom Queen"" back in high school.  She admits to Josh that she feels more of a connection to her mother when she accomplishes similar things that she did.  And being ""Blossom Queen"" makes her feel more connected to her mom.

But as she continues to film the movie, her popular boyfriend and her popular friends start to distance themselves away from her because she is spending more time with a ""geek"".  Dylan feels so comfortable around Josh, but at the same time, she doesn't want to lose her status as the most popular girl in school.

What will she do?

Disney's ""Shake It Up"" is a sitcom which premiered back in November 2010 and was created by writer/producer Chris Thompson (""Laverne & Shirley"", ""Bosom Buddies"", ""The Larry Sanders Show"").

The film series focuses on two friends CeCe Jones (played by Bella Thorne, ""My Own Worst Enemy"", ""Dirty Sexy Money"", ""Big Love"") and Rocky Blue (""Frenemies""), both are stars of a local show known as ""Shake It Up Chicago"" and somehow these two tend to get into a bit of trouble on and off the set.

Together with their friend Deuce Martinez (played by Adam Irogoyen), the three have big dreams of becoming professional dancers and with being hired on ""Shake It Up, Chicago!"", they want to go big!  Meanwhile, CeCe's little brother Flynn (played by Davis Cleveland) and his antics tend to get them into some trouble and are often in competition with brother and sister dance duo, Gunther (played by Kenton Duty) and Tinka (played by Caroline Sunshine).

A total of ten episodes (of the 21-episode first season) are included in the ""Geek Charming"" DVD release.

""Geek Charming"" is presented in widescreen 1:78:1 - Enhanced for 169 Televisions and audio is presented in English 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The film looks good on DVD and considering it's a newer film, picture quality is good especially since there are a good amount of outdoor scenes, and scenes are are well-lit.  Picture quality is also good for  ""Shake It Up"" which is comparable to the quality of series such as ""Hannah Montana"" and ""Sonny with a Chance"" and what one can expect from a DVD release.

Subtitles are presented in English sDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Geek Charming"" comes with 10 episodes of ""Shake It Up"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Geek Charming"" is charming, heartwarming film, but be prepared to laugh but also shed some tears!

When I first began watching ""Geek Charming"", the first thing that came into my mind was ""is this another `Mean Girls' type of film?"".  After all, the film focuses on a popular, self-centered girl who could care less about those who are not popular and her friends are the same.

But things start to change when the popular girl Dylan and the passionate film fan Josh (who Dylan thinks is a ""geek""), decide to work together.  For Josh, he needs to submit a film before deadline and for Dylan, this is her chance to earn some points in order to become this year's ""Blossom Queen"".

The film is a high point in the career of ""Modern Family"" actress Sarah Hyland as it gives her the opportunity to play a character with a variety of emotions.  While in school, she does take the ""popularity"" diva-ish attitude to the extreme, it's when she allows Josh into her life and he starts to discover that outside of school and her popular friends, she's a kind, intelligent girl who wants to feel a connection with her mother that died years ago.

I enjoyed how the film transitioned from Dylan's more obnoxious side to showing a more kinder and gentler person, and we see how she changes through her time spent with Josh, despite her thinking that popular people and geeks can't get along.

But ""Geek Charming"" may seem like your typical banal teenage film, popular girl falls for geek guy and vice versa, but it's how things come together for both people that I found heartwarming and endearing.

And as for the DVD release, this is what makes ""Geek Charming"" much more enticing and its the fact that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment included not one, not two but ten episodes of  Disney Channel's ""Shake It Up"".

I've been reviewing Disney video releases for a long time and you never get a DVD release which includes more than 2 bonus episodes, and the fact that you get ten episodes from season 1 and 2 of ""Shake It Up"", definitely makes this DVD release even more enticing.

Granted, it would have been nice to have special features of some kind with the talent of the show but Disney made up for it by including these bonus episodes.

As for ""Shake It Up"", it's actually an interesting TV series.  Whereas ""Hannah Montana"" focused on a teenage pop star living two lives and hanging out with her best friend, ""Shake It Up"" features two dancers who dream of making it big!  And when both are cast for the local teenage dance show, we see the crazy antics that happen on and off camera. And similar to ""Hannah Montana"" which had Miley's brother and Rico often being the clowns of the series with their crazy antics, ""Shake It Up"" has Ty Blue and Deuce who often get into trouble at the local pizza shop where they work at.

The episodes are fun, but also a bit farfetched as one episode features Cece and Rocky being strapped to an airplane while performing dance moves.  But at the same time, these episodes are full of humor and dancing that children will definitely enjoy this series.

Overall, it's one thing to review ""Geek Charming"" and enjoying the film (as I do feel it is a good Disney Channel Original Movie) but when you add ten episodes of ""Shake It Up"" as extras, which is unheard of when it comes to Disney releases, all I can say is that ""Geek Charming"" fans are getting their money's worth. Because this is a pretty solid DVD release.

Double the fun!  Disney's ""Geek Charming"" + ""Shake It Up"" is a fun and exciting combination and a Disney DVD release worth recommending!",1335571200,14,9714,4.5946573751451805
4980997,5,B0069RWA74,"This is one of the best Disney movie made. This movie is not cheesy! It is well acted! It has a great storyline that is funny, emotional, and teaches valuable lessons. I watched this movie with my 11 year old daughter and surprisingly my husband walked into the room and was drawn into the movie. I don't want to spoil the twist of this movie. But what I can tell you is that being popular doesn't mean that people must treat others like they are useless. I think that ages 9 and up is a good age recommendation. This movie will also open up a discussion topic with child(ren) & parent(s) or group of children & parent(s).",1333238400,,622,4.3247863247863245

Disney continues to bring a high standard to it's TV movie productions and this is one of their best.
It's about friendship, loyalty, integrity and challenges one to look beyond social status facades
to see the real person.
Heart-warming, well-acted and memorable!",1332633600,,365,4.903225806451613
8495486,5,B0069RWA74,"I absolutely love this movie.
I first saw Matt Prokop (Josh) on
High School Musical 3: Senior Year.
He played Jimmy ""the rocket"" Zara on that movie.
He and Sarah Hyland (Dylan)  was also great on this movie.
They make a cute couple together.
This movie is about popular high school girl (Dylan) who is flattered to be asked by film geek (Josh) to be in his film project.
Things don't exactly turn out the way they thought it would.
But in the end,things turn out good for both of them.",1522022400,,485,4.329670329670329
