7801873,5,1934347388,Very nice.  Ising explains each of the basic strikes and defenses in detail. he adds counters. and how to defend against the counter so you can turn it to your advantage. if your interested in Eskrima and there isn't a teacher near you. or just to enhance your skills and knowledge. always good to master the basics and keep practicing them. he can be difficult to understand at times but what he's saying and doing makes it easy to understand. Make sure you have a partner though. most of it you can practice by yourself but you'll need a partner. I'm lucky my wife enjoys the arts as much as me.,1417564800,,597,4.378378378378378
7801874,5,1934347388,Great detailing on the basics of this system. One has to listen carefully as the demonstrator has a strong Phillipino accent. Overall a great production and learning resource for arins aficionado.,1383350400,,196,5.354838709677419
7801875,3,1934347388,The DVD was descent.  Some parts are hard to understand.  I wish whoever produced it made chapters for each section so it is easier to go back to areas you want to research.  Instead you have to rewind and have to find those areas.  And when I say hard to follow its because of the language barrier.,1352592000,,299,4.192982456140351
