8392447,5,B001EGS82Q,This is an excellent film that really gets to the heart of the matter of how much Our Lord loves us and the importance of receiving His True Presence while being in the state of grace. Those that do not find this DVD in line with Catholic teaching may need to review the Catechism of the Catholic Church sections regarding the Eucharist and the Sacrifice of the Holy Mass. This DVD is well worth your money spent on it-Just watch it!,1486252800,,433,4.3580246913580245
8392448,5,B001EGS82Q,"The DVD packaging looks cheap and it seemed used and could have bought it cheaper elsewhere, however, I was pressed for time.

That aside, Im glad I bought the DVD.  I showed this movie to two different age groups:  2-3 graders and 4-6 graders.  The short movie touches the following: Our Lord's sacrificial love for us; His all sufficient atonement for our sins; and His Real Presence in the celebration of every Eucharist.  Most importantly, the children opened up about the movie without me prompting them, they all understood the message: Reconciliation.",1423440000,,558,5.021739130434782

I was looking for a visual explanation of the Catholic Mass presented so that seven, eight and nine year olds could get a basic understanding of what we do.  I purchased this DVD by title and because EWTN's name was connected.  I watched the DVD when I received it and was so disappointed.  I will not be showing this to my Catechism class and again have wasted my money.  I will buy no more DVD's of this nature and from now on will stick to the Catechism to teach from.",1314489600,3,649,5.396039603960396
