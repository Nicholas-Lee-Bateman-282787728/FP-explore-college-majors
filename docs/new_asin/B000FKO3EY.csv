8124175,5,B000FKO3EY,"If you love classic sci fi and monster movies, this flick is for you! Low budget and totally a cheese fest, this homage to all those films we loved as kids is a riot! The cameo appearances of such luminaries as John Agar, Robert Clarke and Les Tremayne are worth the price of admission alone! Treat yourself to a little limburger and get this gem. Who cares about the plot, its the hidden references that make this a must for your DVD collection.",1425168000,2,446,4.385542168674699
8124176,5,B000FKO3EY,"The dumbest, most stupid, most worstest, most funniest thing I have seen in a long time. Talk about being so bad that its good, well that is an understatement. But if you like good bad monster movies, you won't go wrong with this!",1264032000,2,230,4.372093023255814
8124177,3,B000FKO3EY,"If you can remember those old late night reruns of the 1950's classic Sci-Fi movies, you will enjoy some of the spoofs in this movie. And seeing the last appearances of some of the original B-movie actors of that era will be a most touching experience.  Can only watch this one once though. That's enough. Then pass it on to someone else.",1247097600,3,338,4.451612903225806
8124178,3,B000FKO3EY,"If you like the old 1950's sci-fi monster invasion films you'll enjoy this affectionate spoof. What I like most is that they got one of my favorite actors from that genre Kenneth Toby to recreate his character from the Thing a few other films to fight the invading monster. Also some wonderful old character actors appear in small roles through the film, like John (Trantula) Agar, Gloria (I Married a Monster From Outer Space) Talbolt, Les (War Of The Worlds) Tremayne, Robert (The Adventures Of Superman) Shayne, and  Toby's co-star of The Thing, Robert Corthwite. It does get very silly, and the modern actors aren't very good, but for a fan of these films it's a must.",1178928000,15,672,4.743589743589744
8124179,5,B000FKO3EY,"This is a loving look at the Scifi films of the 50's that I and millions of other SciFi Kids grew up watching on saturday mornings at the local theater. Unbelievable monsters terrify the world and we buy it hook, line and sinker. Ted Newsome does a great job of honoring a number of actors who shared the lives of all who followed the Scifi genre. Buy this DVD Now!!! If you love Scifi, you'll love it.",1174694400,13,402,4.233766233766234
8124180,1,B000FKO3EY,"this is quite possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the jokes are all incredibly lame(""give him a hand!"" one characters says, than hands the other guy a small plastic hand), the sound in the film is 2nd rate at best, the video quality is awful, the plot is a jumbled mess, and absolutely NONE of it is even slightly funny! this movie wants to be an homage to the 50's B movies of yesterday, but the badness that it presents to the viewer is not a parody of the wonderful badness of 50's movies, its just plain bad! the dialog isn't so bad its hilarious, its just BAD! the story isn't so bad is funny, its just BAD! this movie isn't funny, it isn't cool, it isn't clever, avoid it at all costs it is absolute, unadulturated, GARBAGE! instead, see Larry Blamire's ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"", a movie that actually hit all the marks that this film missed. Skeleton is funny, clever, cool, and wonderfully capatures the spirit of those 50's B movies, and the wonderful badness therein.in other words, its everything that The Naked Monster isnt. thank you:)",1172361600,8,1093,4.525252525252525
8124181,5,B000FKO3EY,"This is a difficult movie to rate...if you are old enough to have been a fan of many of the old Sci-Fi and Horror movies of the 1950's and are able to spot references to those old films, then you can get some good chuckles from the dialogues and scenes in ""The Naked Monster"".  It was released decades ago with the title of ""Attack of the B-Movie Monster"" to a very limited run on VHS, and now is available as ""The Naked Monster"" on DVD, distributed by Anthem Pictures.  Just keep in mind that the movie is definitely a low-budget production,shot almost as though it was an amateur effort.  You're not going to find this movie anywhere near the caliber of other spoofs, such as ""Airplane"".
  All that being said, the movie brings back to the screen many of the stars of the 50's, including some who are no longer with us, having passed away.  Among those are Kenneth Tobey (""Capt. Hendry"" in ""The Thing"", who died in 2002), Robert Cornthwaite (""Dr. Carrington"" in ""The Thing"", who died in July of 2006), and others from that genre.
  There are some gratuitous nude scenes in the movie, and in a film preview that's also on the DVD, so this film isn't really for kids.
  An interesting extra choice from the menu is an interview done between a horror-movie host and Kenneth Tobey, which has his remembrances of filming some of the movies he had starred in.  That was fun to watch.
  Bottom line is that the 5-Star rating I gave it is for those who mainly want to revisit old memories.  For anyone else, it's merely a curiosity piece.",1156204800,39,1532,4.4640287769784175
