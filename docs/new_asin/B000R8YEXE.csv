As a karate student and teacher for more than thirty five years, I have probably seen just about every karate video on the market. This DVD has become one of my favorite karate videos.  Quite simply, Morris has really put the practical combat applications of karate in his system.  I am usually suspicious of martial artists who create their own style, even though the fact is, most of today's karate masters have created their system from their original karate style.  One of the things I like about this dvd is how Morris explains the real combat meaning behind certain moves within a kata.  I have seem many videos in the past attempt to show the Bunkai (practical application of kata moves) of certain kata, but I always felt most of the bunkais shown were too impractical for real life self-defense.  The Morris approach is different in this respect.  His focus is not on the tournament style of karate, which most traditional styles teach today, but rather, on the practical combat and true self-defense aspects of karate.  My only disagreement with Kissaki-Kai Karate is their insistence that kata holds the key to karate self-defense.  I explore these kata myths in my book, Martial Art and Self-Defensee Myths and Facts and fallacies in the Martial arts and Police Tactics.  In spite of these differences of opinion as to what Kata will and will not do, I give this dvd my highest rating.

 5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Shotokan Karate Self-Defense Techniques: Practical Combat Karate for the street).",1249344000,,1639,4.9416058394160585
8199461,2,B000R8YEXE,"After watching the DVD I contacted a Kissaki-Kai Karate-Do instructor in Malaysia, 6th Dan Vince Choo, I am sorry to say he had very bad manners. I was disappointed, even wrote a complaint to Vince Morris. The DVD is good though.

I prefer DVD to books because it saves trees, and the more senses are engaged, the better we learn. Also you will read a book only once, but you'll pop a DVD into the DVD player many times.

This DVD is well made. Vince Morris gives very clear explanations.

I am giving it two stars because of the aforementioned rudeness. Otherwise I would have given it five stars.",1201651200,2,598,4.467889908256881
