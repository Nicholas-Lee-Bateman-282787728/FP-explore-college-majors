4101849,3,B003ABZGFA,"Seen the plot a thousand times, done with a religious tint to it.  I think it would be OK for children, yes I could recommend it as a family night movie.  Below age ten won't be able to follow it though.  Can't remember any bad language or any seen to bad for children.",1282521600,5,269,4.037735849056604
4101870,3,B003ABZGFA,"The Asylum is infamous to produce mostly real badly executed, painfully directed and acted Genre movies, or even worse knockoff's of mainstream blockbuster's! This one has its own (contrived and confusing) original plot, and, a nice on real locations cinematography! Too bad the acting is painful as ever, aside from the handsome and trying hard to believe in the events, Clint Browning, and, of cult actor, Domiziano Arcangeli which in a few moments shows what's acting about, to the main characters, all played without any firm belief, and so making this even harder to follow! It's too bad, a mini studio like Asylum doesn't employ more often way more deserving talent, or just confine the few ones they can get (like the 2 named above) to undeserving roles or material! These guys just seem to abuse audiences patience with their dislike of truly better efforts, employing more adequate directors and casting with more professional talent, instead of using either terribly picked, unattractive unknown, or washed up B stars, just in to cash the grim (i suppose) paycheck!",1390608000,,1075,5.0790960451977405
4101871,2,B003ABZGFA,"Aside from the fact that the daughter of a Journalist goes missing after she refuses to allow her husband  to take the daughter for 2 weeks,  I know little of the details of this movie save the way it ends. I could not understand most of the dialogue nor where the action took place save that it started in the United States and ended in Israel or some place adjacent to Israel. Who Was Doing What To Whom, for What Reason was never made clear nor understandable. Where Armageddon came in was never made clear to me. From the Reviews, most shared my perplexity. If you watch it, you might do better. However, if you care to buy it, see the collection  6 Disaster Movies. The disc cover features, in large print, SCORCHER.
On second viewing at a later date what I wrote previously still stands. However, in checking other reviews on another website, I found out that the film was made by a non-Jewish religiously oriented firm. Just what was anti-Israeli, as some comments there asserted,  I could not make out, given the inadequacy of my understanding expressed in my review. Perhaps this is a movie best viewed by those who take joy in discovering the murderer in mystery books and similar types.",1375056000,,1197,4.579439252336448
4101872,3,B003ABZGFA,I thought this movie was pretty good.  A lot of end of days style movies are out there.  Parts of this movie was slow and can get confusing.  One of Asylums better movies.,1373068800,,171,4.121212121212121
4101873,1,B003ABZGFA,"Great characters, great story idea, great special effects that simply don't add up to the title. The mishmash of visual and interaction of characters seems to be going nowhere, regardless of the premises set up and then ignored by the director or writer. I'm giving this one away.",1363478400,,280,4.854166666666667
4101874,2,B003ABZGFA,could not finish watching the movie.  did not like it at all.  just not my style of movie I guess,1356393600,,97,3.8
4101875,5,B003ABZGFA,"This one I can recommend!!  Always consider the source and don't compare to secular films.  If you do, you might be disappointed.  I bought a bunch of films on the End Times to show to our youth group.  I did not preview this one first but thankfully it was a good one!!  Many of the other ones I bought were awful.  This one was not.  It was kind of like the TV show 24 but a Christian, end times version.  The end of the movie had the kids saying, ""they can't end it like that!!!""  Seemed like they were setting up for a sequel but I do not think one was every made.  This is a good one.",1353715200,2,589,3.9152542372881354
4101876,5,B003ABZGFA,Excellent movie.  Worth the investment.  I have seen this movie and others from Cloud 10 and they are on the money.  Uncanny things shown in the movie are similar to things happening in today's world.,1347408000,,200,4.6571428571428575
4101877,3,B003ABZGFA,"Whether it's called Countdown Armageddon or Countdown Jerusalem this movie is a challenge to follow and to understand; I'm a student of Bible prophecy and I had trouble putting the parts of the movie together. A lot is going on in the film but trying to figure out where it is all going and how it's going to end is almost impossible.

I'll admit that the major factor that kept me going was curiosity as to how it would end; I'm sorry to have to report that the end was inconclusive and still left me wondering what was going on. From a Biblical perspective a few familiar points emerged but not in what I would call anywhere close to the Biblical order of events. This one is sort of an end-times exercise in frustration.

There were a few interesting moments but these were too few and far between to compensate for the confusion that permeated the rest of the film.

I would definitely recommend watching before buying; having seen it once I'll probably be slow to watch it again.",1317513600,10,984,4.4860335195530725
4101878,1,B003ABZGFA,It is very hard to make sense of this movie and the plots drag on and on and on- very frustrating and pointless. This movie has nothing to do with Bible or any Biblical facts- don't waste your time and money.,1315180800,9,208,4.097560975609756
4101879,1,B003ABZGFA,"Although this movie looked promising it left me not only confused but also saying huh??? Again, the background noise verses the dialogue was way off. I had a hard time hearing about 1/2 the dialogue but was able to follow the story line ok. I thought the mother's behavior in Jerusalem was a bit unrealistic as she seemed unaffected by all the chaos and war around her. Being a first time visitor to that area also didn't seem realistic because she seemed quite familiar to the streets and buildings. She did not seem confused or anything in an unusual area. The end was way less then desirable as I do not understand how it could have ended that way at all. If this movie is indeed portraying Rapture or end times, which it certainly does seem to be, then I do not comprehend how she could meet up with the person and at the end of the movie. The camera work was very badly done as lots of shots had half or partial heads in them and the shots seemed to be cropped to much leaving out information that could have helped the story line. The camera angel was a bit jumpy (shaky) in the shots seemed to jump from one situation to another without explanation. I think the director was following the Left Behind Movie plot but was no where near that quality. I would just go get Left Behind movie and watch that instead.
All in all, the plot was slow, unrealistic and I found the movie boring.
There was no swearing in it, nor anything objectionable. However it was a bit slow and kids will find it boring and hard to follow.",1287100800,18,1521,4.340350877192982
8392937,5,B003ABZGFA,"I really like this movie.  In order to understand it you must have some knowledge of the rapture, end time prophecy, and Revolution (the final book of the Christian Bible).",1527638400,,172,4.733333333333333
8392938,1,B003ABZGFA,"One of the freaking stupedist movies I have ever seen.  The acting isn't bad, but the plot is total garbage.  A woman is pushed out of a car and told to meet back at the hotel and then walks through about 50 miles of desert at high noon????? Don't wast your time on this movie.  Wish I hadn't.",1525219200,,293,4.017241379310345
8392939,5,B003ABZGFA,GOOD MOVIE,1469577600,,10,4.5
8392940,1,B003ABZGFA,"I was truely disappointed in this movie, I don't think it lived up to its name and its a horrible disaster movie. Its seems like the the weather & natural disaster effects were thrown in as afterthoughts. The main plot was the kidnapping & search for missing daughter and ex. I wish there would have been more attn paid to the natural disasters, & less to the conspiracy theories & missing persons. Not impressed, sorry I wasted my money.",1448323200,,438,4.556962025316456
8392941,5,B003ABZGFA,Terrific movie!,1444953600,,15,7.0
8392942,4,B003ABZGFA,"Actually,  I liked this movie.  It confirms a lot about what I have heard and read over the years.  If I were to be treated for some serious condition,  I would want want the Israelis to do it,  as they are the only ones who seem to have a reverence for life in this world!  Regretably, I do not have the means to visit the Holy Land to experience this for myself.  Mine own country is pushing for euthaniasa.  The devil's work!",1433203200,,428,4.134146341463414
8392943,3,B003ABZGFA,its a ok movie. i have seen better. don't regret buying it tho.,1408320000,,63,3.923076923076923
8392944,1,B003ABZGFA,"This movie is included on 7 Disaster Movies I picked up in the $5 discount bin.  I bought this collection, because Death Flight was on it.  I started to watch this movie, but couldn't finish.  It is horrible. A real ""cluster"".  Don't waste your money.  It's confusing, doesn't make any sense, and to make matters worse the handful of special effects were a joke.",1406764800,,362,4.59375
8392945,1,B003ABZGFA,"Hmmmmmmmmm.  Someone didn't finish their studies in filmmaking school.  This movie is literally all over the place tying to be a suspense thriller based on some select Biblical prophecy (specifically the end of days, Revelation).  Why they skipped the Rapture and went straight for doomsday makes no sense.  If they were trying to confuse people, then they get top marks, if they were trying to relate a coherent story of the end times, then they get a complete failure.  Even elementary story telling dictates they provide some semblance of order to the story they're promoting.  In this case, a curiously cold woman with unspecified grievances with her ex-husband suddenly loses their daughter because she was too busy yapping on the phone to pay attention to her (left alone in a park restroom).  From that point on it is an uninvolving traipse from one end of the world to the other looking for her kid and the husband who may or  may not have kidnap her.  All this woman does throughout this entire movie is walk and run and walk.  Her emoting skills are suspect.  Watching paint dry would be more entertaining than this perplexing treatise to supernatural events yet to unfold.  Unconvincing, illogical, and just downright boring are the only ways to describe this failed attempt at filmmaking.  (They should consider themselves fortunate that no one thinks to sue them for fraud!)",1404604800,,1387,4.926724137931035
8392946,1,B003ABZGFA,"The background sound track was way too loud I couldn't hear much of the dialogue over the blaring, overpowering, and distracting noise. Acting was woody and lifeless, and the script dragged on ever so slowly. The sequencing of scenes were confusing, convoluted, and seemed pointless. The hazy plot hanged on with no clear resolution at every turn. Characterization was vague and uneven, and even the title is a disconnect from the key plot. Lots of promise at first, but the movie turns out at best a mediocrity. Not up there in this genre.",1398902400,,540,4.817204301075269
