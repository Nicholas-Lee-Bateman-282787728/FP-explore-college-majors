So, I rented it, watched it, and I loved it!  Great  animation.  Perfect for any anime fan!",922492800,,261,4.019607843137255
948995,5,6305021651,This movie has great animation and excellent dialouge added to it. It also has a story that makes it keep you watching it for hours and hours. I recommend it to all magic-lovers and comedians. I'm sure the movie will be  a blast in America and everywhere else.,912038400,,260,4.416666666666667
949064,4,6305021651,"Where as most anime movies based on a TV series act as either a midquel or sequel, the first(of five)Slayers movies was done as a prequel. This movie(known as Slayers Perfect in Japan)takes place during the time of Slayers Special which was all about a slightly younger and brown-haired Lina Inverse who tours around with the egotistical sorceress, Naga the Serpent(aka: Princess Amelia's missing older sister!). Although this film seems to take place sometime after the Slayers Excellent OVA series which showed how Lina and Naga first met up.

Lina runs into Naga again, and the two of them luck out by lifting some tickets from bandits to the resort island of Mipross, which sports some special hot springs(no, not like in Ranma 1/2!). Once there, they have to deal with one ""strongest man on the island"" after the other. They make their way to the hot springs which Naga exposes as a fake. It's proprietor takes retribution by using his water-bending magic to get back at them, but Lina & Naga's combined skills stop him. After taking him to the local king for a reward, they learn that the King and Queen have been plagued with dreams featuring an old mage. Lina herself has been pestered in her sleep by the same wizard, Rowdy Gabriev, who is really the ancestor of Lina's future-drinking buddy, Gourry. She and Naga investigate some old ruins where the King informs them that a powerful demon has been wreaking havoc, and the head of all the evil dicks that they've run into on the island. The demon is Joyrock, a reptilian monster that has gathered alot of mana over the centuries since he killed off a bunch of elves who lived on Mipross, and Rowdy became a mage since then trying to find a way altering time so that Joyrock never succeeded in the first place. After sacrificing himself, he manages to send Lina back in time, and she Dragonslaves Joyrock out of existance. Lina and Naga come back to find that the island is now very prosperous as if its dark past never happened, although the two of them remember everything that happened. Lina also gets short-changed with no reward to speak of, and Rowdy gyps her too with the promise of a ""growth-enhancing"" magical spring, which she hoped to use on her notoriously small cleavage.

This movie featured some improved animation than that of the TV series. Then again, alot of anime shows from the mid-90s were seriously lacking in good animation. It was directed by Hiroshi Watanabe who went on to do the rest of the Slayers Special anime titles. ADV Films released in the States, and it featured a different dub from the TV show. Cynthia Martinez made her anime debut as the American actress of Lina, and Kelly Manison pulls of a convincing Naga, laugh and all! On its own, this makes for a pretty decent movie, even if you've never seen any other Slayers material prior to it. The only thing that never comes up from this is Lina ever mentioning to Gourry in some of the later episodes of the TV series that she met his great-great-great-etc.-grandfather. Anyway, like most Slayers stories, it is a perfect stab at the entire RPG fan genre. Anyone who thinks D&D players take their ""craft"" way to seriously should strap them down and force them to watch this movie Clockwork Orange-style!",1271721600,3,3251,4.701754385964913

This is also what introduced me to this great anime series. For one thing, this anime is freaken HILARIOUS! I should know, for Nicki says that silly rhyme all the time.

949067,5,6305021651,"Many people are, at first, turned off by the fact that the original crew is not a part of the series.  However, this movie (and the other OVAs) actually take place just BEFORE the Slayers, Slayers Next, and Slayers Try series.  Sure, there is no Ghourry stumbling about, but Naga and Lina make a good set of ""rivals"" as they steal/win tickets for an exotic resort that appears rarely.  There is magic, mayhem, mockery, and, of course, the infamous Fireball (best one ever in the entire series can be found in Motion Picture).  This movie can stand on its own merits.  As Naga and Lina attempt to enjoy their stay at the resort, Lina is plagued by dreams of an old man who carries a familiar-esque staff, who needs her help resolving the past, where he failed to save his true love (those who have watched the other series will go ""Oh"" regarding the Gabriev family).  There are also the usual stock villains and constant teasings about Lina's small chest.  The voices are different, but understandable, as Lina is younger in this movie.  Overall, a lot of fun, and the best of the OVAs.",1141516800,6,1085,4.556701030927835
949068,3,6305021651,"I came to Slayers not through ADV but through Software Sculptors, a sister company to Central Park Media, so this movie was a little jarring. I'll explain why.

Firstly, the voices aren't the same. The voices from the superior series wasn't brought along to make the movie, and that was a bit of a let down for me, especially after seeing 52 episodes and getting used to the voices there. Secondly, only one character is from the original series, that being Lina Inverse. Instead, they add a new sidekick/rival in the form of Nahga. Finally, the story seems to be based during the same time as the series, making it a bit confusing.

It's difficult to get past some of what I mentioned. But I tried, and after watching it I realized I wasn't disappointed with what ADV produced, it just wasn't what I knew. The story itself follows Lina and Nahga along as they try to make a holiday on the Isle of Mipross when a mysterious demon appears to battle Lina and Nahga, ruining their vacation. What follows is a series of magical battles, animated pretty well, with a bit of comedy mixed in.

This is not a bad movie; in fact, it's very entertaining. It just doesn't match well with the series, which contained some very lovable characters and some tense battles. I could only recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't had the chance to see the original Slayers series and liked Sorcerer Hunters, or for those of you are are willing to accept change.",1137542400,,1444,4.5675675675675675

949070,5,6305021651,"My son introduced me to anime not too long ago. Like most things, there's a lot of junk, but ""Slayers, the Motion Picture"" is defentely NOT junk! I was unaware that it was originally a TV series in Japan, but this movie can stand entirely on it's own: Heroines, villians, good writing and characterization, great animation, and finally, an evil foe with great power and no conscience whatsoever. I do have to agree with my son, though, that it's best to watch this movie with subtitles rather than dubbing. Dubbing cannot capture the same character qualities as the original- and often very witty- Japanese dialouges does.",1125446400,,622,4.877358490566038
949071,4,6305021651,"Talk about going way back into the past. The original slayers with Lina and Naga bring back some horrid memories of high school when I was first introduced into this series. Unlike Slayers, this version is a little bit self centered around Lina and Naga rather than a long drawn story plot. The art is even darker and a little bit dry. However those used to Lisa Ortiz playing Lina will be in surprise of another actress...who sounds a LOT different, making Lina seem more young...and she tends to scream....a lot. Also the wonderful laugh of Naga the serphent...surely rivals upon your last nerve. Overall the story is based that the girls travel to an island to fight other sorcerers in search of defeating the number one strongest. there is also a slight reference to the sword of light in this movie. In the end, it has a gentle splash of comedy and story as you'll be more drawn to see how it works out rather what quirks Lina gets herself into. Should you enjoy this movie, I reccommend Slayers Great, Excellent, Return and Gorgeous.",1119052800,,1039,4.621621621621622
949072,5,6305021651,"This was the very first Slayers DVD I ever bought, and I wasn't disappointed, it was funny and had lots of action, even a little drama and romance.  I'm not going to bother and try and explain the characters, since practically every other review does that, so all I have to say is that if you are a fan of any of these attributes in an anime, pick it up, you won't be sorry.  There was only one small gripe I had, but it was small, while listening to the Japanese language with English subtitles, on scene 2 when Lina is talking to a bandit she tied up, the subtitle sort of appears and disappears in a split nanosecond before it is even able to be read, the only way I was able to read it was by pausing and going frame by frame to catch the subtitle, same thing goes with the Spanish subtitle.  But enough about the con/negative; this movie has lots of pros/positives, the Japanese and English voices are all good.  Lina and Naga from both languages have voices that suit them both, the time travel plot is interesting, the villian is ugly and evil, the comments about Lina being short startured, feather-brained, and small breasted crack me up, and Naga is well...very grown up in all the right places!  Buy this DVD, buy it, buy it, BUY IT!!!!!",1070582400,6,1248,4.362068965517241
949073,4,6305021651,"I first saw this at Blockbuster and sence it was anime, I rented it. Even if you haven't seen Slayers you will love this humorus, action flic. This is what first made me a Slayers fan.
As always the red headed and firery tempered Lina Inverse is getting herself and her rather 'obscure' partner Naga in trouble. When Lina 'broke' the leg of a pick pocketer the guys gang up on her, and use Naga was their weapon. When Lina talks a limited amount of commen sence into Naga, they kick the living daylights out of the crooks. Then while foreging through their stuff, Naga finds two discound tickets to the Island of Miprhos. Miprhos is well known for it's hot srings and that is what gains Lina and Naga's attention. But soon they learn of a devious plan going on in the Island of Miprhos.
A demon named Joyrock (who is an awsome demon at that) has been ranpaging the Island for centuries. When he attacks an Elven village, Joyrock is challenged by Rowdy, a young human who loves the elves. Rowdy carries with him, The Sword of Light, yet when he challenges Joyrock it fails. So Rowdy must wait for centuris waiting for the aid of Lina Inverse, and her dim-witted partner Naga.
I absolutly refuse to give away the ending, but it is very different. I loved it. Also the ending theme song, Midnight Blue by Magumi Hasashibara is awsome.
All in all you get almost everything in a quality anime film, humor, action, demons, and stupid side kicks. I have watched this over and over and over, and each time I enjoy it. The money is well worth it",1040169600,,1536,4.431095406360424
949095,4,6305021651,"Every reviewer is subject to certain embarrassing moments when they are solemnly reading or watching and suddenly a voice goes of in their heads that says ""Yo!!  This is funny!""  I have spent so much time lately with the heavier anime films that it took me more than a few minutes to realize that 'Slayers' is a pure and joyous romp, full of sly and not so sly innuendoes, exaggerated action, and villains that are ridiculous rather than sublime.  After puzzling over the dour messages of Akira or Evangelion this confection put together by Kazuo Yamazaki, based on the original work of Hazime Kanzaka and Rui Araizumi, is the perfect heart's ease.
Lina Inverse is a mage endowed with considerable power, who is less fortunate elsewhere (I would not mention this if it were not for the fact that it is the film's longest running joke).  Playing Cordelia to Lina's Willow is Nahga, another mage, but one whose blandishments are distracting.  Nahga also has a bad habit of casting spells that create magical seafood salad.  These two young ladies are off to Mipross Island to frolic in the hot springs and enjoy the scenery.
Of course, all is not as wonderful as it seems.  Lina is bothered by an old man who keeps interfering in her dreams, Nahga discovers the natural hot springs are fakes, and the two must conquer a string of 'toughest guys on the island.'  Lina proves easily that she is really the island's toughest guy.  Or, she almost does, at least until they run into Michigan J. Joyrock, a frog who also happens to be the toughest demon on the island.  Now the two women and Rowdy the Sage are locked in a deadly fight with an impervious demon who has an irritating habit of going 'bwahaha.'  Their only hope is to reroute the river of time itself.
For a light-hearted farce with some burlesque dialogue, the film is very enjoyable.  The plot never gets monotonous, the acting in both the English and Japanese versions is excellent, and the artwork is surprisingly good.  The film may be silly, but it isn't trashy.  By all means, track it down, and watch it a few times.  Sometimes you just don't want to have to think.",1039564800,7,2129,4.610079575596817
949096,2,6305021651,"I found this movie to be a really big disappointment since I rather enjoy the Slayers TV series.  None of the main characters besides Lina show up which will be disappointing to fans of Gourry, Zelgadis, and Amelia.  The animation quality is better than the TV series but the movie just isn't very funny which is a big problem for a comedy (most of the jokes are comments about Lina's physique and they just aren't as funny as when it's Gourry making the comment) .  You'd get more enjoyment out of watching one of the Slayers Next or Try DVDs.",1030924800,,544,4.42
949097,3,6305021651,"As with most TV to movie features, Slayers the Motion Picture deviates significantly from the original TV series. The movie is a side story, of a younger Lina traveling with her friend and rival, Naga the Serpent. Through serendipitous events, the two end up vacationing on Mipross Island, a mysterious tourist spot famous for its hot springs. Here the two are beseeched to undertake a quest, to set right a wrong committed in the islands past, leading to the clich high stakes conflict. Would it really be a movie without it? Despite the movie conventions, the comedy is outstanding and makes this a really enjoyable film. The stream of increasingly more powerful opponents succeed as memorable comic villains. The addition of Naga creates a quality, two-man comedy act. Though fans may be disappointed with the exclusion of the characters from the TV show, I think the humor works well, and fans will enjoy copious jabs at Lina's inadequacy complex. The DVD is not without it's merits. The menu is appealing and clear. The extras include a small cell gallery; music-video trailers for the movie and OAVs; and character-bios for the movie cast. The audio seems to be Dolby Digital 2 channel both English and Japanese. The dub, while not bad, just can't hold a candle to the Japanese dialog, especially Megumi Hayashibara's wonderful performance. The video seems too dark and may prompt you to adjust your monitor settings. My big gripe about the subtitle is the translation of magical spells from things like the phonetic ""Dil-Brando"" to the descriptive ""Explosion Array"". While understandable for the dub, the subtitle should have used a more literal interpretation. I really enjoyed this film but it may not be for everyone. As far as the DVD goes, I have to give it a three for the number of small gripes above, but I highly recommend watching this entertaining film.",1008460800,3,1871,4.942857142857143
949098,1,6305021651,"The series is so much better. This was stupid. There was only Lina, no Gourry, no Zel, or Xellos, and 2, only 2! dragon slaves. NO comic relief---buy the series if you want slayers, and if you have the series, this is just a waste of money.",1006732800,,240,4.127659574468085
949099,5,6305021651,"This is one of the best Anime Series that I have seen. Of coarse it is a bit silly but that adds to its already awesome effect. I won't tell you at all about the story but this is just a great Anime. Watching this DVD was a huge mistake. Now I have to save up all my Christmas money and buy the series! Take it from someone who knows about anime. I have seen all the clasics from Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, Ninja reserection (Err, don't tell anyone I saw that..Its just wrong) all the Samuri Xs and even almost all of DBZ, yes in Japanese. I have seen lots of other anime and Slayers is just awesome and I HIGHLY recomend any anime fan to add at least the motion picture to your collection! BTW Lina is hotter than Nahga ever thought about being!

but if you are a fantasy lover who lieks to laugh, this is the series for you.  Lina Inverse and Nagha the white serpent head off to a mysterious isle, where time doesn't flow correctly.  There they encounter a demon, named Joyrock.  Their battles against him are truly awesome.  To make the series even better it even has some time travel.
The only complaint: the end seemed a bit rushed.  One minute they're talking to the old mage, Rowdy, the next their fighting Joyrock.  It would have been nice if that part was expanded a bit more.",996364800,,706,4.4765625

Instead substituted with a character named Nagah.  Even though it didn't have the characters this movie was still great.  But I reccomend you watch this all the movies and OVAs with Nagah then watch the series.  If you watch the movies first then you can apriciate them more without the other characters.",996278400,,528,4.412371134020619
949102,3,6305021651,"I'm happy to say that Slayers has well-rounded characters, good dubbing, and excellent animation. Not so happily I say that the plot itself is uninteresting and the fight scenes are cheap and predictable. Almost every battle begins and ends with a single spell being cast. The only interesting things were these: The three jelly-like creatures, Naga's lack of clothing, the dragon whose body was completely out of proportion with its head, the awesome closing theme, and the Spring of Growth. Slayers is a very popular series so it wouldn't be wise to go by just one opinion, but it didn't do much for me.",992995200,,605,4.826923076923077

949104,4,6305021651,"If you're looking for something short, funny, and entertaining with a bit of adventure mixed in, Slayers: The Motion Picture is it.
Plot: The movie begins with the introduction of the main character, Lina Inverse, a powerful sorceress. She meets Nahga, her supposed most powerful rival(certainly the most well-endowed and having the most annoying laugh on earth) during a battle, when they decide to work together. From then on they fight all sorts of stereotypical male enemies together and embark on a journey to Mipross island where all sorts of insane, funny, and sometimes deep, adventures await(including an evil jellyfish cult). Entertaining and involved plot, with minimal but well-done character development.
Animation: The animation is good(especially the character animation), but nothing special. The backgrounds are slightly washed out.
Subtitles: Fairly true to dialogue with some discrepancies in translation. However, unless you're a big Slayers fan who knows all the spells and names by heart, it won't bother you. Mostly well done, legible.
Audio: Good. Nothing to write home about.
Overall: Slayers: The Movie's appeal lies mostly in its ability to give you a good dose of comedy and adventure in an hour and a half. It leaves you satisfied without you having to go out and buy the entire series. You might be better off renting it, however, unless you're a big Slayers fan. Although very well done, not really the kind of movie to see over and over again.

Lina is one small petite sorceror who weirdly has a body of a young  girl. This is because her growth rate is much slower than the normal girls.  However to make up for that, she's bestowed with incredible magical powers.  She's also a food gobbler and jump at any chance to make money or plunder  any treasure. Robbers and bandits scurry away when her name is mentioned.  However, the story take a different turn when with Gourry, she met Rezo, a  red priest who is blind. Behind the caring and loving face, Rezo holds a  deep dark secret which could destroy the whole land. Lina and Gourry take  up the mission to stop Rezo with the help of Rezo's former servant,  Zelgadis whom Lina defeated. Their mission will take them to the final  showdown with the strongest enemy Lina Inverse has ever met. Laugh!  What  can I say apart from this word. The whole show is filled with gags and  slapsticks that there's no seriousness except when Lina prepares to  finishes her opponent off with the mightiest of her spell. Gourry, with his  swordsmanship however is another dumb blonde fellow who got caught up with  Lina when he rescued her thinking there was a maiden in distress.

So when I heard the movie was finally hitting American shores I did the first thing that hit me, buy the damn  thing!  ""It's SLAYERS! "" I said.  ""I MUST own it! "" I  screamed.  Then I got it and....well...wasn't that impressed.  I will  admit, the animation is superb. But it really has nothing to do with the  T.V. serise.  I mean, when did Lina go off by herself?  It had to be  between Slayers and Slayers Next, but it isn't well explaned.  True, there  is an allusion to the TV series due to Randy and the Sword of Light, but  nothing else.  I would recommend this to those who aren't too familiar with  the serise, because it's a great introduction to the Slayers tone. But to  hardcore fans of the TV, be wary.  You make like it, but then again......  P.S. Don't watch the dubbed, not only is Lina's voice kinda whiny, the  actress who does Naga, copies the annoying laugh that the original actress  uses, and doesn't do it too well.",957744000,,1046,4.278350515463917

It has plot, good character development for Naga and Lina and overall everything that is to be expected of Slayers except for one thing. That is  consistancy in subtitling between Software Sculptors and ADV Films. For  instance, Explosion Array is actually called (gasp) Dill Brand. How does  ADV plan to explain how the spell Mega Brand is not translated as Mega  Explosion Array? They can't.  Furthermore, Gaav Flare is not Guard  Flair. Gaav is one of the primary antagonists in Slayers NEXT. ADV would  have known this if they had watched the original series, but apparently  they didn't.  In the end, I believe this movie deserves 5 stars. It has  everything that a good comedic anime film should have and more.  Unfortunately, because of how much the bad subtitling bothered me, I only  gave it four stars.

949144,5,6305021651,"I absolutely LOVED this film! It would've been better with Zelgadis, Xelloss, Amelia, and Gourry instead of that psychotic alcoholic with the freaky laugh. Yes, I'm talking about Naga. (OOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!)And  Lisa Ortiz should've come back and done Lina's voice, and all those  variations of the Dragon Slave got a bit annoying. But aside from that, it  was one of the best movies I've ever seen! Definetly worth your money! Its  hilarious, full of action, and all those cool spells too!",948931200,3,494,5.1375
949145,4,6305021651,"This movie starts off really stupid kinda like a pokemon show. But this movie gets real deep ecspecialy the story line the animation is top quality also. Many people over look slayers as a kiddy show ,but I think this  should be a necessity to any ones anime library.",947462400,,267,4.448979591836735
949146,3,6305021651,"This was a so-so effort that is something that is great for the kids and presented all the basics of the 'Slayers' series in a fairly concise package. Still, I don't think the package was concise enough.
One of the  things I've liked about as much of the 'Slayers' series I've seen so far is  that the episodes are all swiftly paced and tightly plotted. Gag follows  upon gag upon fight scene... there's hardly ever a quiet moment. There were  almost too many quiet moments in 'the Motion Picture.'
The movie also  failed to capitilize on some of the cooler elements that were introduced;  wouldn't a bit more time spent in the past have been more interesting than  beating up local thugs on the pier? I for one would have liked to learned  more about the elves and the kid who appeared to be an ancestor of  Gourry.
I'll continue to work my way through the tapes of the half-hour  episodes, though. I'm hooked on the insane adventures of Lina Inverse.",946339200,,952,4.514619883040936

949170,5,6305021651,"'Slayers: The Motion Picture' is an anime film with a lot of qualities: Excellent animation, good humor and main characters that are quite detailed. It starts out a little slow and childish, but if you stick with  the film the whole way through, you find it gets better and better. After  seeing this video, I set forth on a mission to find and collect all the  Slayers videos that I can. Great show!",930787200,,400,4.4520547945205475
949171,3,6305021651,I love almost all Slayers... But this one is the worst i've seen.. the dubbing is completely terrible and ADV didn't even get Ortiz.  And the Change the Dragon Slave way to much.  And Where did this other Sword of  light come from? what happend to being only one?,930096000,,263,4.326530612244898
949172,4,6305021651,"Slayers the Motion Picture, the first of the Slayers movies, is quite good. Though ADV couldn't get Ortiz to play the part of Lina in the English version, the new Lina is quite good. The only thing that keeps me from  giving a five star rating is ADV's rewriting, that is, the renaming of a  spell name that was already in English in the original Japanese and  inserting references to other work that was not originally present. The  subtitled version has many of the same problems, though does a little  better.
But, this is only worth one star off. The rest of the movie, the  quality of the dub acting, and the humor make up for shortcomings in the  translation, assuming that Naga doesn't scare you off.",923184000,,707,4.519685039370079

7880697,5,6305021651,"Haven't seen the series yet, but I have been a fan of this movie since I was a teenager. A fun movie, may be appropriate for PG-13 audiences. Swearing, fantasy violence, lots of discussion about the female protagonist's physical attributes. Some skimpy female fantasy outfits, but no nudity. The story is actually pretty intriguing for what seems at first to be a humorous series.",1506729600,,380,4.953125

7880699,5,6305021651,"Last year I became hooked on Slayers.  The first couple episodes weren't great, but from episode 3 it got better.  With a few exceptions, everything from Ameias first appearance and up is gold.  Im only a few episodes into the second season, but at this point its better than the first season was.  I got the 3 season megaset for Christmas, and while it could be awhile before I finish that I thought that Id critique the only other Slayers DVD I got for a Christmas present.

I just finally got around to watching it yesterday, and I loved it.  From the get-go, it sets itself apart from other movies for anime series because instead of taking place during the show, it serves as a prequel to the series.  It shows Lina before she met Gourry, Xellos or any of her other companions in the show.  Instead her sidekick (and rival) is another sorceress known as Nahga.  Despite this, it still feels exactly like the show at its best and that is a very good thing.  For a movie, it has a really good story.  Im not saying its one of the greatest stories ever told, but for an anime movie which could have been just phoned in they take the time to craft together a one-off but still very strong story with some interesting ties to the show.  Not only is this a very interesting story, there are a lot of great laughs.  Slayers is known for having great comedy, and those expecting some really funny moments will not be disappointed.  The only bad thing I have to say about this film is that Nahgas costume is rather skimpy.  I have to admit that doesnt bother me for the most part, but I do wish her rear end had more coverage.  Her bikini actually seemed more modest to me!  But since its only really noticeable for 1 or 2 seconds it could have been a lot worse.

So in conclusion, if you like the Slayers anime you will not be disappointed with this movie.  Just make sure you're watching it in Japanese with English subtitles.  I have all the other movies (apart from Slayers Premium) as well as both sets of OAVs, and I am really looking forward to seeing them now.",1491264000,,2064,4.339425587467363
