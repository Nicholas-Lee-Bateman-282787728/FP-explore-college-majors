1177248,5,B0000028KH,"Sing Yourself Silly is the best video I've come across for both babies and young children.  I'm 42 and I love it!  I work in a daycare and if a baby starts fussing, all I have to do is pop in Sing Yourself Silly and the baby is instantly mesmerized, rocking to the music and smiling.  Older children (ages 5 and 6) request this video because of the humor.  They laugh out loud and never seem to tire of it.  The songs are catchy, witty, and most of all, fun!  Jim Henson was a genius.",993859200,9,484,4.042105263157895
1177249,4,B0000028KH,"""Waving Goodbye to You"" and ""Put Down the Ducky"" are probably worth the price of the tape with clever lyrics that are quite funny.  If you're an adult of a certain age you will get a pang seeing the late Madeline Kahn, Big Joe Williams and John Candy perform (in Put Down the Ducky.)  You will also see James Taylor with a bit more hair than he has at present. If you're looking for a tape with educational value for your kids, I'm not sure you'll find it here.  I think Sesame Street's ""Let's Make Music"" is far superior in that regard.  But, this is a good diversion and is,well, silly.  I have a quibble with the static visual qualities of Sesame Street tapes in general, and this one in particular.  I just think so much more could be done with backgrounds, patterns, etc. but I must be in the minority given the series' obvious popularity.",985651200,,844,4.378205128205129
1177250,5,B0000028KH,I loved watching this tape and loved watching my nieces and nephews watch it.  They couldn't stop dancing the whole time.,959385600,,121,4.761904761904762
1177251,5,B0000028KH,My 9 month old loves this tape.  The songs are entertaining and they keep his attention.  This will be his 1st of many Sesame Street videos to come.  I highly recommend it!,953510400,,172,4.3125
1177252,5,B0000028KH,"When my 7 year old was a baby, this was her first and favorite video.  We watched it every day.  Now my second child is 1 and it is her favorite!  We too watch it every day.  I am buying another so that we will have a back  up.  JellyMan Kelly, Put Down the Ducky, and Waving Goodbye are great!",949536000,2,294,3.816666666666667
1177253,4,B0000028KH,"I had this tape years ago, shortly after it came out. It was part of my childrens Sesame street collection, and it was by far their favorite. I recently dug out the collection for my youngest who is 18 months, but this  one was missing. Luckily I found it here at Amazon. It is very cute, and  has great songs that are really catchy..mom and dad will find themselves  singing along. ""Put down the ducky"" is a great one, with many  famous guest stars singing along. Any Sesame fan would love this video.",945561600,7,502,4.365591397849462
1177254,5,B0000028KH,I have a 2 year old and a 7 year old.  They both request this video more than any other in the house.,941846400,5,101,3.391304347826087
1177255,5,B0000028KH,"This is a clever compilation of very silly, but entertaining songs.  I know them by heart and my son dances, claps and is thorougly entertained.",920419200,,144,4.76
7902174,5,B0000028KH,"Ships fast, item as described.",1419984000,,30,5.2
7902175,5,B0000028KH,This is classic Sesame Street and extreme fun for parents. Children will put up with it if you tell them their only other choice is Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. *smirk*,1387497600,,168,4.827586206896552
7902176,5,B0000028KH,"I bought this a long time ago for my kids, and we all loved it.  My daughter who is now 19 and I have been searching everywhere for this because our's was broken.  She found it on Amazon the same day I did and she called and said she wanted to get it for my younger son.
It is amusing, entertaining and you will walk around singing these songs all day!  A great value!",1068336000,2,368,3.945945945945946
7902177,5,B0000028KH,"This video was my 13 year olds favorite when she was a toddler, she played it so many times I'm surprised it still plays. Now my 8 month old sits there in a daze and watches it from beginning to end. She doesn't like Baby Einstein or regular cartoons yet but would watch this since she was 6 months old. I'm planning to buy it for Christmas gifts. I think this is the best Sesame video they made, even an adult can be entertained by it. The down side is I can't seem to get the songs out of my head.",1068163200,3,499,3.9504950495049505
7902178,5,B0000028KH,"This video, in addition to being almost exclusively songs, contains not only great Muppet songs like ""Honker Duckie Dinger Jamboree,"" but terrific vintage Sesame Street animation, and, for diehard fans - A FULL-LENGTH clip with Kermit and DON MUSIC (parents, pad your pianos!) There's a terrific ""acapella"" version of ""Old MacDonald"" with Honkers, Dingers, Fluffy the Elephant and a Yip-Yip. Also, it's got James Taylor singing ""Jelly Man Kelly"" and the celebrity-soaked ""Put Down the Duckie""
I love the way the clips are introduced - a muppet appears and comments on them - there's no award show, no setup, no plot -  JUST MUPPETS BEING SILLY (OK, there's one appearance by Maria and Luis in Groucho glasses!)",1045526400,5,710,5.068376068376068
7902179,5,B0000028KH,I recently had to purchase this video again I got it as a gift 12 years ago when my son was born he then passed it on to his younger brother they both loved it then I thought I was finished having children so I passed it on to my neice for her daughters then who would have thought 9 years after my youngest son was born I would have twin girls???!!! they are now 6 months old and I bought this hoping they would enjoy it as much as the boys did they do it is a lifesaver I can sit then in thier bouncy seats and I get about a half an hour where I can do things that I need to do or maybe just read a book or whatever EVERYONE needs this video!!!!,1042848000,2,647,3.72992700729927
7902180,5,B0000028KH,"""Sing Yourself Silly"" is fun,colorful and full of great songs.  My older kids loved it now I'm buying it again for my new baby!!  You can trust Sesame Street to do a great job with kids and this particular bunch of songs and characters will have you and your kids singing along and laughing hysterically.  This is definitely not a before bedtime video!",1033689600,,352,4.555555555555555
7902181,5,B0000028KH,"The death of Jim Henson in 1990, and the departure of most of the rest of the original Muppet crew, seems to have robbed Sesame Street of much of the loony inventiveness that made it a favorite to so many kids over the years.  This seems to be why most of the Sesame Street videos that you can buy nowadays are so lame--they contain the newer stuff, with dull songs and uninspired patter.  This one, though, is older than most of the others (the clips all seem to be from the 1980s), so it's much better.  Also, it's virtually nonstop music from start to finish, which makes it a particularly good choice for babies like ours, who prefer music over anything else.",1018396800,2,663,4.418032786885246
7902182,5,B0000028KH,"This video is my favorite gifts to give to new parents. It is the ONLY video that can hold a child (and their parents)captive from start to finish. Encourages counting, singing  and most important - being silly. The cast of characters are familiar and entertaining. Watch it once and you will be  hooked. I find myself singing ""Ladybug picnic"" and ""Put Down  the Ducky"" at Work!!",994982400,,379,4.712121212121212
