706890,5,6303820905,"John Sayles has crafted a wonderful fable concerning a young girl, Fiona, sent to live with her grandparents after the death of her father. What she finds out about her mother and the brother everyone thought was lost will  enlighten the most cynical and charm the most bitter of viewers.  The  score, adapted in large part by Mason Darling is wistful and lovely, and  Eileen Loughlane sings one of the loveliest lullabys ever recorded.
A  film that can't be recommended too highly.",913507200,3,482,4.829268292682927
706891,4,6303820905,"The children in this story are very important in the gradual persuasion of  the adults to move back to the island they had called home.  They cut  through the history, excuses and various reasons why the adults knew they  could not go back.  There is also a presentation of the legend of the  mermaid, who in this case comes from the seals and takes care of one of the  family's children, which they had believed had been lost.  Very enjoyable  and interesting story; well filmed and acted.  END",904262400,,495,4.5227272727272725

707302,5,6303820905,"We need a million more movies like this one - full of magic, beauty, heritage, folklore and family. This movie beautifully captures each of those while leaving out the truly dark themes modern movies are full of - immorality, selfishness, profanity, etc. The acting at times can be a bit amateurish, but honestly, that added something innocent and sweet. I did not see it as a detriment. This movie is truly a treasure of what is really important and good in the world. It is slow, it is thoughtful, it is full of nuance, and it allows the viewer to truly feel the love, pride, and endurance of the Irish family. My husband of 30 years and I watched this together last night, as we will be traveling to Co Donegal in September, and we are really looking forward to making a stop at Dawros Bay to get a look at the beautiful scenery we saw in the movie.  I highly recommend this lovely film to anyone looking to escape the crassness of modern movies and be transported to a beautiful place of Irish heritage and history.",1497312000,,1019,4.449197860962567

707826,5,6303820905,"Some films are so meticulously realistic, you're convinced youve been transported into the world onscreenand you don't want to leave. Youre so in tune with the characters emotions, that your heart beats with theirs, you ache with their hurts and long for their dreams. Welcome to The Secret of Roan Inish,

This unforgettable film was shot in Donegal on Irelands wild northwest coast, by famed cinematographer Haskell Wexler. The scenery is so exquisite, its been called cinematically rhapsodic. Here on the isle of seals (in Gaelic), craggy rocks create refuge for dive-bombing seabirds and sunbathing seals. Its all so beautifully real, you swear you can taste sea salt on your lips.

When magic is brought into such a film, especially when its added subtley, without the fanfare of CGI special effects, the whole film seems to vibrate at a higher level. This style is called magic realism. For me, its the highest form of film art. The Secret of Roan Inish, written and directed by John Sayles, in a remarkably understated way, is one of my favorite films.

On the surface, the tale is simplea little girl fights fate to bring her family back to its ancestral peacefulness. But like any Irish story, dark, unseen undercurrents roil without warning. Thats why you have to pay attention to this movie. And why, although it stars child actors, the movie might be too complex for children used to rapid-fire action. Its best for adults to see the movie first, then sit with children to guide their viewing.

Its the late 1940s. Western Ireland suffers a post-war moribund economy. The government can no longer provide services to the remote islands. Men cant make enough money to support their families. In a mass departure, called the evacuation, everyone on Roan Inish leaves the island for new lives on the mainland.

Fair-haired, ten-year-old Fiona Conneely (Jeni Courtney) is sent by her unhappy father to live with her grandparents. On a small rented farm, Grandfather Hugh (Mick Lally) and Grandmother Tess (Eileen Colgan), eke out an existence with the help of Fionas 13-year old cousin, Eamon (Richard Sheridan). If Fiona squints just right through the western window, she can see the outline of Roan Inish across the bay. She dreams of living there. In a marvelous sequence, representing many weeks, Fiona and Eamon secretly repair the thatch-roofed cottage and gardens their grandparents used to own.

Fiona finds a childs footprint in the sand, but waves wash it away. Although refusing to talk about the footprint, Grandmother Tess allows Fiona to meet her dark, mysterious uncle Tadhg (Irish-Italian John Lynch).

In haunting flashbacks, Fiona is swallowed up by Tadhgs strange tales.  Generations ago, a male ancestor found a selkie on the beach. She was so beautiful, he stole her sealskin, wrapped her in a blanket, and took her home. Nuala (Susan Lynch, actor John Lynchs real-life sister) was a good wife and mother, until she discovered her stolen skin. She returned to the sea.

When a dark-haired Conneely child is born, Tahg says, its a reminder of the familys  selkie genes. Just like Fionas baby brother, Jamie.

On the day the island was evacuated, Jamies wooden boat-cradle was resting on the beach and waves took him out to sea. Some say he disappeared so quickly because seals were pushing his cradle. Horrified by Tadhgs story, Fiona insists she will do everything she can to find Jamie.  Hes my little brother, she cries. Hes lost out there!

Hes not lost, Tadhg says. Hes just with another branch of the family.

Discouraged, feeling helpless and alone, Fiona almost gives up hope. Then, one day on Roan Inish, she spies a naked, black-haired little boy picking wildflowers",1472342400,,3704,4.982171799027553

All in all, it is just really adorable and uplifting, a welcome change from Disney princess movies.

I often don't like child actors, but this movie is certainly the exception. It's also a great role model for young girls as the protagonist is a ten year old girl. I don't know how many times I've watched this, but I practically have the dialog memorized and I even spotted an error in the cinematography. I can't say enough good things about ""The Secret of Roan Inish""; however, I wish they would put it--and several other Sayles movies--out in Blu-ray.

708907,5,6303820905,"The story takes place in post WWII where people's way of life change. Fiona (Jeni Courtney) a 10 year old Irish girl, who recently lost her mother, goes to live with her grandparents for a better way of life. There she hears many tales of the history of her family and her missing brother.

John Sayles wrote the screenplay. The story is based on a children's book by Rosalie K. Fry. They try to stick to the simplistic telling of a child's story, yet do have to do a little manipulating and adding extra characters to make the story work on film.

There is no CGI; however there are trained sea lions and Animatronics. There are great visuals and excellent back ground music that does not overwhelm the dialog.

Be sure to get the DVD with the voice over commentary as it adds greatly to the experience.

If you happen to be a tad older than the target audience you may also appreciate "" The Edge of the World"" (1937) written and directed by Michael Powell.",1420848000,,958,4.426136363636363

My family has become a part of that underground fan-base who seeks out these movie treasures.  This is a great one - full of the old Irish folklore, the beautiful, haunting music, that wonderful accent and a great story spun in and around all those elements.

Here are some others that we have found:  Darby O'Gill and the Little People (for the younger ones), Into The West, A Shine of Rainbows, Waking Ned Devine, Ondine (for a little older-starring Colin Farrell), The Water Horse (that one is set in Scotland)

It is breathtakingly filmed and displays the desolate beauty of the islands off of the northern coast of Ireland. The soundtrack is composed of Celtic music which in itself is worth the price of admission. Though the actors are obscure to American audiences they do a commendable job that at times seems like a work of love. The story is a little hard to follow at times, and therefore I would not recommend this movie as a ""babysitter"" for kids under ten. However if close attention is paid this story works well for the pre-teen and teen set, as well as adults. If you are a fan of Erin, this is the movie for you.",1406419200,2,723,4.402985074626866

It is an almost magical movie.  The mood it creates is bewitching.  The seals are easily seen as having a  supernatural identity, for instance.  The acting is so natural, and the story itself so endearing.

`The Secret of Roan Inish' tells the story of a young girl, Fiona, as she travels to live with her grandparents in the countryside.  Her mother has recently died and her father has turned to alcohol to cure his depression.  Fiona leaves the city and ventures to her grandparent's home, where she begins to entertain seeming fantasies concerning her deceased baby brother Jamie.  The story goes that when the family was forced to evacuate their homes on the Isle of Roan Inish, baby Jamie was washed out to sea.  But there is more to the story, and as Fiona soon discovers, her blood is tainted with the blood of the Selkies (basically Irish mermaids; half human-half seal) and her brother may not be dead afterall.

This soft and sweet little film is a wonder for parents and children.  I don't recommend it for the real young, simply because the film is slower paced and could be boring for them.  The accents are also VERY thick and so that may be an issue for the kids.  That being said, the film itself is just spellbinding; the perfect blend of reality and fantasy.",1382659200,,1331,4.527196652719665

709352,5,6303820905,"This movie may be too slow for some, but the tone of the movie is haunting and the story it tells is sad and beautiful at the same time.  Its not a high-gloss Hollywood movie by any means, but the landscape alone is worth viewing.

Fiona is a young girl who goes to live with her grandparents.  Slowly, she uncovers the truth (or perhaps the origin myth) of her family and the seductive and secretive island of Roan Inish that they had left years ago.  It goes hand in hand with the glimpses she gets of her long-lost younger brother, who was swept out to sea one day in his wooden cradle.  Is he truly alive?  Has he been taken in by the mythical seal-people?  What is the relationship between her family and the selkies?  Why has all of their luck gone bad?  Can she get her brother back and her family all together again in the place that is clearly in their blood...the seal island of Roan Inish?

This is a story of the sea and of a family born to (or of) the sea.  All of the fantasy aspects of the story are very well done, and very believable in their own way.  The stories of selkies go back for many years and this is one of the best movies ever done about these fantastical sea creatures and their relationship to the human world.  The movie does a good job of portraying the myths of the selkies.  You'll never look on a seal again in the same way.

Nicely done.  The music for the movie is also very good, a perfect match to the tone of the movie.  Overall, a good movie to sit down and watch with the kids, unless they are only interested in smash-up action movies.",1378252800,2,1579,4.192691029900332

Half of the movie is in historical viginettes as characters relating stories to the little girl on the cover in fine Irish tradition. The little twist at the end with her ever-practical grandmother was surprising and delightful. I played this for my sister and she promptly said that 'I have to have this movie!'-hence this purchase.

So really, I bought this movie for the memories.

709488,5,6303820905,"This beautiful film, directed by John Sayles, with his lyrical screenplay (based on a Rosalie K. Fry novel), stands the test of time. Sayles found inspiration in the poetic Celtic folklore about selkies, where seals transform into humans. I suggest using the subtitles, in order not to miss a word of the lovely dialogue. The cinematography with the characters in a luminous Irish landscape of sea, sky, seals, islands, and coast is exquisite.

A young girl, Fiona, is the center of the narrative; a serious, lonely child, she is sent to live with her grandparents and cousin Eamon on the west coast of Ireland by her grief-stricken father. He is lost, part of the wave of displaced immigrants, nicknamed ""scousers"" in ports like Liverpool (scouse shortened from ""lobscouse,"" derived from a Norse fish-stew eaten by dockworkers and sailors). Jeni Courtney perfectly plays Fiona, with remarkable subtlety and nuance. She explores her new environment, longing to go out to sea with her cousin and grandfather, to see the island of Roan Inish. One afternoon, a brooding young man (the excellent actor and writer John Lynch) tells Fiona about the selkies, and regales her with the legend of how one of their common village ancestors met a mysterious woman who gave birth to the dark ones of their community; a beautiful woman (John Lynch's real-life sister, Susan Lynch, another fine actor) is really a selkie, whose babies were lulled to sleep by the sound of the sea from a special cradle, the same cradle Fiona's lost baby brother Jamie had ...

Fiona learns that her family was forced to leave the magical island of Roan Inish; her kindly grandmother teaches her about cooking their traditional seaweed stew over the hearth. Once Fiona discovers Roan Inish herself, she and Eamon work hard to refurbish the abandoned cottages. She tells her family that she actually saw young Jamie running wild on the island, with only a seal for company, but no one believes her. Those who know the grief of family torn apart by strife may especially understand Fiona's drive to return to Roan Inish and search for her brother.

This film is filled with gentle magic; ""Harry Potter"" has ruined little magic, the glimpse you might catch out of the corner of your eye. Such magic is in all our lives. It's still there, but if you're not looking, you might just miss it. Nowadays, many people expect to see the fantastical, like that in ""Harry Potter"" and the like, they are not looking for the little magic that actually exists. ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" is replete with little magic, love, and kindness. Enjoy!

709744,5,6303820905,"Excellent, beautiful, inoffensive.  The absorbing and unusual events of the story are experienced through the eyes and heart of a young Irish girl who goes to live with her grandparents, near the sea, somewhere near the village of Killibegs.  Scenes are set mostly in beautiful green countrysides and rocky seascapes or within the cottage home of fisher-folks (the grandparents).  The action takes place after WWII but seems timeless, or for all times, as it touches upon the mystery of  ""generational"" life in families, the seemingly chance encounters in life that draw couples together, the fates of their children, the search for identity within the context of family life. The story is about real life events--a toddling little boy who goes alone to sea, for instance.  But these events sometimes have what might be termed mythical qualities.  A viewer will need to have an accepting attitude toward old folk tales in order to appreciate references to the legendary race of the selkies, part-seal and part-human beings that supposedly lived sometimes in the sea and sometimes on the land.  The mere animal seals in this story have almost human qualities.  Whoever watches the movie will see what I mean...

This movie had somewhat the same effect on me as does some old Irish folk music, creating an almost painful sense of longing that rises from mysteries of human and Godly love hidden in one's Unconscious, hidden in the mysterious long-ago past.  It's something rather inexplicable.  I was very moved by the story and cried at the end.  --Maybe such emotional responses to Irish music and stories only happen to people who have a bit of Irish heritage...?  But, anyway...

The four main characters are two young people and their grandparents.  Throughout the movie, one doesn't quite know how to feel toward the grandmother who seems to be a negative ""blockader"" of sorts--until the end, when ""revelations"" occur and actions move on to the turning point.

Going into it, I thought that this was a movie for children.  Actually, it would be in the ""family movie"" category.  Anyone from about 10 years of age on up could enjoy it, but adults would be able to appreciate it best.  Several grown-ups (both of Irish background) have told me that this is one of their very most-favorite movies.

This story would be moving, I think, to people who've experienced a special brother-and-sister bond of love.

The movie begins and ends with brief flashes of information about ""the mother"" in the story who died at the young age of 36.  She is a fairly important background character.  (I think it's an interesting and rather mysterious coincidence that I happened to pick up and watch this movie, without knowing anything about the story, early in the morning on Mother's Day.  And later in the day, a further coincidence was that the sermon at church touched upon some points about family life that were consistent with some of the realities depicted in this story!)

The sound-track features moments of Irish piping, fiddling, and drumming.

The ""Cradle-Boat"" is unforgettable as is the whole image of Jamie going to sea in it.  I loved it.  That sturdy  diminutive wooden ""bark"" carved and studded with sea shells and that purposeful little child pushing off in it!",1336867200,,3267,4.943119266055046
709745,5,6303820905,"My husband and I seldom watch a movie more than once, but over time, we've wanted to get into this enchanting experience again and again -- and so we've happily bought the DVD.

A strong-minded Irish girl named Fiona is 10 years old.  Her mother has just died and her father is usually drunk, so she is sent to live with her grandparents on the nearby coast.  This whole family and all residents of their small island, Roan Inish, were forced leave there a few years previously, during WWII.  But the grandparents at their new location can still see the island across the water.

A particular tragedy that occurred during the exit of Roan Inish was Fiona's baby brother Jimmy (or Jemie) being set down on the shore while they were busy with the move, and the tide coming in and carrying him out to sea in his hand-carved cradle-boat and being lost forever.

This is probably one of the reasons Fiona's parents became so removed from her life - the mom dying and the dad drinking.  But her dad's parents are strong and healthy people, taking care of themselves and Fiona and her cousin Eamon on the wild Irish coast.

Meanwhile, the grandfather likes to tell the family story about his great-grandfather, who one day found a selkie on shore.  Selkies (or silkies) are large seals who magically shed their pelts and become human when they choose, such as to sunbathe on the rocks.  The great-grandfather captured a beautiful selkie woman one day, and according to mystical tradition, must take her pelt and hide it.  If he does not, she will find it, don it, and take back to the water as a seal.

It's considered a great thing to capture a selkie wife, and fortunately, he treats her very well and she happily bears their children - although something in her always longs for the sea.  One day - and this is the risk of taking a selkie wife - one of the older children finds the hidden pelt and asks her mother what it is.  Immediately she takes it on the shore and heads back into the sea.  But these legends say that ""mom"" stays not too far out in the water, and can be seen as a special seal playing with the children when they swim.

Back to the present, Fiona looks out over the water to the abandoned island, wonders about the seals, and becomes certain she occasionally sees a light on the island at night.  Grandmother is aggravated that Grandfather has ""filled her head with tales"" and she only imagines what she's seeing, but Fiona becomes quite adamant she's right about this and finds ways to visit the island.

One day there, she's certain she sees a little naked boy with a shock of black hair running away from her on the beach.  (Although Fiona is fair-haired, there's usually a ""black Irish"" who is born in each generation in those families who may have a selkie ancestor.)

With her cousin Eamon's help, Fiona is determined to do ""a bit of cleanin' up"" of the cottages and help her grandparents move back to the island, which they long to do.  But mainly she is determined to ""find Jimmy"" and solve the mystery of Roan Inish.

The Irish brogues of these local actors are so authentic that sometimes it's hard to understand their words, so subtitles can help.  By the third or fourth time around for us, though - we understand them like family ourselves!

  The setting on the remote seacoast of eastern Ireland is visually mesmerizing. The characters seem ethereal as they go about their daily tasks in this world removed from modern technology. We discover a culture unchanged for generations facing the unthinkable prospect of uprooting themselves from everything they have ever known.

709810,3,6303820905,"When 7 yeasr old Fiona Coneely's mother dies, the young girl moves into the city with her father, then to the Irishirsh countryside to live with her grandparents. Through a series of stories her grandfather tells, we learn that the entire Coneely clan had, until just recently, lived on Roan Inish, a small isle off the Irish coast. When Fiona's mother died, all the young people moved to the mainland, and since they would have been alone otherwise, so did the grandparents. We also hear of the mysterious disappearance of Jaime, Fiona's baby brother, who floated off to sea in his cradle. Allegedly, people have recently seen Jaime, still floating about with seals around him. Fiona also swears that she saw a light in one of the cottages on Roan Inish. Will she ever find her beloved baby brother, or has the sea taken him to become king of the seals?
 I must say, the first 20 minutes of the film left me bored and not wantiing to finish the movie. Because it never really states anything outright and you must use inference to sort out what is happening, this is the type of movie that your brain must be engaged in 100% of the time, even if only to discern what is being said through the thick Irish accents. What truly hooked me in was the incredible cinematography. There aren't too many movies that come out satateside that take place in Ireland, and the oft-used helicopter shot, monotonous in movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", was a breath of fresh air in The Secret of Roan Inish The acting was more or less average. I was quite impressed by the maturity Jeni Courtney showed in the role of Fiona, the wisdom in her young eyes. However, the worrk of the other actors I felt was a one-dimensional and teleprompter-y. This may not all be a fault of their own, because the story didn't offer much in terms of character development. The constant Irish fiddling score was very well fitting, especially to scenes of spritely Fiona exploring, and was a good reminder of the dramatic setting.
  I had one big problem with the storyline, though. The movie is set right after WWI, offering a real-life achor to the plot, but when fantastic things start happening, I admit that I had trouble suspending my disbelief. I do well with stories that are either 100% fantasy or 100% realistic, but 50/50 just doesn't work for me.
 Overall, I give this three out of five stars. It is a graet escape-type movie, and a good taste of real cinema for school age kids.",1308268800,5,2463,4.590909090909091

The Secret of Roan Inish is such a modern (20th Century) tale of a Selkie who in her beautiful human form, becomes a gentetic matriarch of a family and her gifts are passed down once per generation. After the the tiny island of Roan Inish is evacuated due to WWII and the tragic loss at see of a family menber, the family is never the same and no one ever returns until magic and fate step in.

I'm also a teacher among those things, lover of story, American, with nothing to add here that the hundreds of reviewers haven't eloquently spoken. What a masterful movie maker and movie. But it's St. Patty's Day and this is the movie I've shared for ages with my classes to set the tone and introduce the ""culture of Ireland.""
Asking permission of course.
It's a movie that for kids starts with a child losing her mum, losing her brother,now going back to her grandparents who are living by the sea with a father not coping well with any of this, earning his way now in the city.
He's a drunk and you can't blame him drowning in sorrow and guilt. She, Fiona, returns all by herself, a first glimpse into her independence and character (and situation) to Grandparents displaced off their beloved island by war. But they love it as their center, and they tell her of it, and of themselves so she might be re-entered into the heart of family. Splintered they are by these tragedies.
This I know well from my own family way, telling you of who you came from. It's gauzy, you feel pieces of understanding building meanings, you have back story, flash backward, enter myths and dreams and gain an understanding of these people, crawling through the tales. Genius willingness to allow you slowly into both the terrible that's happened, but also who they are, how the stage is set for accepting what will be. All well done work.

The children I teach at first watching struggle with this, as we are just now talking about how time can work in stories and I stop and give pieces of explanation. The story centers on Fiona as she snuggles into her life with her grandparents getting out of the filth of the city, no place for a child. She wants to open up the story of her brother, hear what happened, know about him, a tiny infant lost at sea when their family was removed from this island. She wants to wander into the place I think I'd call the silences of things we cannot face. She is the one brave enough to lead them all on forward. It's important to note that is built beautifully, acted simply, and just as fresh as the spray off the sea here.

And as she does this, as she goes back to the island, as the movie progresses into something surreal and about the power of myth, she takes her audience, us, into the places myth serves. It's as if while we are healing with them, retelling to lead to acceptance, sharing this pain, while we are dreaming and designing what can be, what comes to pass, the miracle here, it starts to bring to my class actual joy and a sense of wonder. I cannot reveal so much without giving the plot away (and it certainly is revealed in other reviews)  but this family so used to hardship remarkably through their young get a break, yet it comes in the magical realism. It is a miracle.

So why use this with a class, why watch year after year? I am very fond of how this uses flashback and dream sequences in talking to time and memory with children. It has a place in talking to people's ways of telling to their young the story of family, something my kids understand, it has a heroine-a character who is female that asks questions, investigates, seeks what she knows to be true. It discusses truth interestingly along the way. And the film speaks to the silkies, man's ties to animal, a people living in fishing and the sea many generations, their hard work and respect for the home they have, for the children. It helps us talk about how myth grows. It's purposes. It's familiar just as it is distant. The sound of the voices, the sound of the seas, all of this the filmmaker captures, designs and gives to the children.

Everyone knows this film has been around a long time. It's tested and true as a story worth seeing. This day I'm out of school sadly not sharing the holiday with my class too ill, but we will finish it tomorrow on my return. Despite everything they'll cheer that. No class ever failed to vote it one of the best experiences I provided. I think because it's embedded within a culture and family with a wee naked baby running through and it ends as we wish it might, it is a movie, and we have permission to allow things to be ok, just for a little while.
And that feels like the gift story can bring. Well worth watching.

710033,4,6303820905,"If John Sayles, the independent American filmmaker, is not the greatest director in the history of the medium, he certainly has to be considered among the most daring and diverse filmmakers ever. From tales set in America's past (Matewan), to yuppy dramadies (The Return Of The Secaucus Seven), to urban social satires (The Brother From Another Planet), to more modern looks at American life (Sunshine State, Lone Star, Casa De Los Babys), Sayles has shown a desire to explore things no other filmmaker has. And while he does not have a distinctive look nor style, each of films is well wrought, and a worthy addition to world cinema. One of his most daring films was actually one of his most popular and financially successful- 1995's Irish fantasy film, The Secret Of Roan Inish.
  Ok, let me rephrase- to call The Secret Of Roan Inish a fantasy film- even if Sayles  adapted the screenplay from a 1957 children's book (The Secret Of Ron Mor Skerry) by Rosalie K. Fry, is to sell it short. It is a very sly and deep look at childhood and the loneliness that accompanies such. In this way, it is very much in league with such other explorations of early childhood loneliness as Val Lewton's 1944 film The Curse Of The Cat People and 1968's Godzilla's Revenge. It is also very much a great family film along the lines of October Sky and My Dog Skip.
  It is also very much a mythic film. That term is often overused to describe films that deal with `epic' characters or situations, but that sort of description and film too often wallows in the pseudo-babble of faux intellectuals like Joseph Campbell. This film succeeds by using the exact opposite tack- it presents the film very much from a child's eye point of view, that of its lead character Fiona Coneely (Jeni Courtney)- a cute ten year old blond girl who goes to live with her grandparents after World War Two, because her mother has died, and her father has had to go off to Scotland to find work.
  The film did only mediocre at the box office, but that's because it is a terrific and deep film that never condescends. It is a children's film sans explosions and wiseass children, and explodes the idea that films aimed at children need be lesser versions of their adult counterparts. In fact, they have a greater charge- to appeal to kids as well as adults, and on both levels. Children's films, in fact, should have more ideas crammed into them as children can absorb more and learn from them without the biases and fears that a typical adult has acquired.
  The film runs a crisp hour and forty-three minutes, and not a second is wasted. The only quibble one might have with the film is its title. It really should have been called The Secrets (plural) Of Roan Inish, for more than the secret of Jamie's fate is involved. Yet, the flaws in this film are very minor- such as Fiona's repeated inability to outwit her wild child brother, compared to the film's virtues- almost all else. The Secret Of Roan Inish is one of Sayles' best films, and arguably a great film in its own right. That this film did what it did with so little shows that true creativity thrives no matter what its source of nourishment is, and that when that creativity is a product of John Sayles' mind, it's likely to be something well beyond the norm.",1221868800,,3287,4.567062818336163

Fry, which explored the Celtic legend of the selkie, seals that can turn into humans. Ten-year-old Fiona has been living in the city, but is sent to live with her grandparents on a remote island in Donegal, Ireland. She plunges into the mystery of the disappearance of her younger brother Jamie, and along the way meets her strange cousin Tadhg (John Lynch), who tells her the story of her selkie ancestor. Fiona is consumed with her quest to find her brother, whom she's seen swimming with the seals, and to convince her grandparents that she's telling the truth.

The cinematography of craggy Donegal is beautifully shot, bringing to life the small fishing community where Fiona's family lives. Flashbacks capably illustrate the unusual pedigree of Fiona's ancestors, and it's telling that child Fiona has no trouble in understanding Tadhg, while adults write him off as odd.

710287,5,6303820905,"It seems that the spirits of a place, once having welcomed you and made room for you, broken bread with you and married you, becoming, as it were, part of your family, do take it much amiss if you up and leave the place, ingrate that you are,  without so much as a"" how-do-you-do.""  They are likely to take a hostage just to make sure you don't stay away too long.
That, in a mussel-shell is the premise of John Sayles' wonderful evocation of the Irish coastal region with all its magic and mystery intact.
The Irish landscape (and seascape) is alive with elemental spirits: spirits of wells and rivers, trees and bogs, hills and plains.  Every one of them has ""a local habitation and a name,"" as the bard says, and will live harmoniously enough with humans as long as they are treated with respect and deference.  ""Dis"" a faerie, though, and you will pay dearly.
Such is the fate of the Conneely family of Roan Inish.
The story takes place in post war (and by that I mean WWII) Ireland.  It centers on a young girl, Fiona Conneely (Jeni Courtney), who has just come to live in a coastal fishing village with her grandparents, Hugh (Mick Lally) and Tess (Eileen Colgan).
Before the war, the young Conneely boys, Fiona's father, Jim among them, left the island of Roan Inish to find work in the cities after the death of her Mother, Brigid.  It was on that very day that her little brother Jaimie (Cillian Byrne), was lost to the sea.  His boat-shaped cradle, handed down through the generations, floated off, aided by the island's seals (Roan Inish means Island of the Seals), not to be seen again for three years.  ""What the sea will take,"" Hugh says, ""the sea must have,"" thus giving voice to the love/hate relationship these watermen have with the sea that sustains them and, often randomly, kills them.
Distraught at the loss of his wife and his son, Fiona's father descends into alcoholism in the city and is unable to care for the girl.  She is sent to his parents on the coast.
Shortly after arriving, she sees a light on Roan Inish and becomes convinced that Jaimie is still alive and still living there.  Her quest to discover how and why he was taken is the engine that drives the story.  What she discovers is nothing short of magic.  Jaimie and she are descendants of a selkie, half human and half seal.  Sometimes, a selkie sheds her seal skin to emerge as a beautiful woman (Susan Lynch) if the skin is captured, she will become a dutiful and loving wife to the man who possesses it, but if she ever finds it, will return to the sea without a moment's hesitation.  Her descendants, particularly the ""dark ones,"" one of which is born to every generation, will be gifted with the madness of ""the Sight.""
The Secret of Roan Inish is often found among the children's films at the video stores.  It shouldn't be.  Much of the film is told through stories told by various characters and flashbacks and keeping track of the action may be too much for children.  Just because it involves a child and the has one foot in the world of Faerie, does not make it a children's film.
Although the disappearance of little Jaimie is a punishmnt for the Conneely's deserting Roan Inish, this is still a gentle story.  The seals are not evil, after all; they are really quite beneficial to the fishermen who share the sea's bounty with them, often protecting them from its dangers.  It's just that the Conneely's broke faith with them and they took Jaimie as a hostage against the family's return to the island.
The narrative line of the film is very much like an Irish hero's journey in that it tends to be circular rather than linear, and by circular I mean a concentric circle, for although Fiona passes the same spots on the journey, the passage of time and accumulated knowledge makes them appear different and give the story a forward thrust, but to one expecting a linear story line, it may seem repetitive.
The performances are universally excellent.  Of particular note is Mick Lally's Hugh and Eileen Colgan's Tess.  His fanciful superstition is offset against her apparent pragmatism; both veteran actors acquit themselves well.  The surprise, though, is the charm of Jeni Courtney as Fiona.  Sayles has managed to get a marvelous performance out of such a young and inexperienced actress.  There is a directness about her and a simplicity of expression.  You have to love her.
The music is one of the great elements of the film and could easily stand alone as a soundtrack.
The Secret if Roan Inish is not just for the Irish.  It is a timeless tale of faith in and harmony with Nature, which is the greatest form of magic.",1192579200,,4629,4.573849878934625

710290,5,6303820905,"Quality in movie making is often judged by Hollywood glitz and flash, computer-generated special effects, high-dollar stars, and big budgets. This film has none of these things, therefore it is a perfectly excellent film.

""Roan Inish"" brings to life the oral storytelling tradition of the Irish people. In what some in the literary field may term ""magical realism,"" this film places the fantastic alongside the mundane, and though there are moments of revelation and surprise for the characters, these two seemingly separate worlds co-exist harmoniously. A prime example of this is the character of Tadhg, whom all but the film's star, little Fiona, believe to be ""daft"" due to his deep connection with his past, and his understanding of the selkie mythology of which that past is composed.

This movie accomplishes the telling of a complex story through the use of native Irish actors who seem to have a real feel for the storytelling tradition, as well as the use of simplistic special effects and magnificent camera work. It is a gentle, simple, yet fascinating tale of one little girl's dream of finding her lost brother, and the mysteries she uncovers in the quest. A better movie for the entire family has not been made. This is by far my favorite movie of all time.",1187136000,4,1273,4.916279069767442
710291,5,6303820905,"Those three words pretty much sum up the entire film. Delightful for both adults (even those without kids), teenagers, and children alike. Magical in its setting, telling, and plot. Rare in its innocent, but complex and far from sugary tale.

Based on the novel, ""The Secret of Ron Mor Skerry,"" this film is set in post-war Ireland it tells the tale of Fiona, a little girl with three older brothers and a widower father. Before WWII, the family had lived a pastoral life on the islands to the west of the mainland. Right before they were evacuated, Fiona's mother died, leaving a newborn brother behind. But as the family prepared to leave the island for good, Jamie, in his little cradle boat, was swept off the beach and into the waves in a freak storm. Fiona's father and brothers race in a row boat to find him, but the cradle is carried away at an unnatural speed and little Jamie is eventually lost in the storm.

And so the family goes to the mainland. Fiona and her brothers move to the city, where her father and brothers work in a laundry. With little time to care for her, her father sends Fiona to his parents on the coast.

It is from her grandparents and her cousin Eamon that Fiona hears the tales about her family, some taller than others. And so she is immersed in the mythology surrounding her family and the sea.

I won't say more. Suffice to say that seals and magic and going backward to go forward are involved. You'll have to watch it for yourself to see the real magic in it.

The cast is amazing, all Irish, if I'm not mistaken. Down to the last actor, they give good, solid, and believable performances. Many children's films are cursed by either bad acting or bad scripts, The Secret of Roan Inish has neither. And so it becomes more than a children's film. The magic is not the wave-of-the-wand kind, nor the kind that comes with a puff of smoke. It's the old kind of magic in fairy tales and legends.

I think I love this film because there are no ""bad"" parts; no parts I ever want to fast forward through or skip because they are cringe-inducing or ""scary."" I love every second of this film. And I think you will, too.",1186099200,4,2149,4.414141414141414

Another tragedy strikes when her younger brother, who is still a baby, disappears out to sea and is presumably drowned.  And her father, upset at some of the difficulties that he has faced, elects to send the young girl, Fiona, to live with her grandparents.

The grandparents live in a rented small stone and thatched roof hut near the sea.  The grandfather is a bright eyed, bearded, jolly and hopeful old man who tells Fiona stories of her ancestors and hints at the legend of the selkies, who are half human, half seal.

They are magical creatures that shed their seal skin and become human.  Mysteriously, there is a dark haired, and dark eyed child in every generation of the girl's family and young Fiona begins to believe that this is somehow related to the legends that she has heard about the selkies.

Her relationship with her grandparents is temporarily disturbed when they face eviction so more upscale renters can move into their tiny home.  And Fiona also angers and saddens her grandparents by claiming to dream about her disappeared younger brother.

Despite the problems that the family seems to face, the conclusion seems as satisfying as it can be.

It is refreshing to see a movie unveil a mystery and keep the viewers interest without resorting to shallow scenes of violence.  Instead, the interest is held with intrigue, folklore, and the strength of family and tradition.

When a little Irish girl named Fiona moves to the country to be with her grandparents she learns tales about her family and their island, Roan Inish.  The Island is now deserted, except when Fiona visits there she finds that may not be true.  The secrets of Roan Inish are kept by the seals and the selkies that swim around in its waters.

Fiona learns about the selkies as part of an explanation as to why one 'dark one' (dark hair and eyes) appear in every generation of her family.  Selkies are seals that can shed there skin and become human.  They can roam the earth and live and love like normal people, however, they always long for the sea.  If a selkie finds their skin, they will always return to the sea.

This movie isn't only about the seals and selkies, it's also about families and traditions, homes and histories, about finding lost loved ones and discovering new ones.  Everything about this movie is wonderful; the scenery is breathtaking, the actors are amazing, the story imaginative and brilliant.  This is a fanciful tale told in a factual manner, making it so real and tangible.  After watching this movie, you will never see another seal without looking in its eyes wondering if it is a selkie.

I think this is a story that, if it becomes known, will truly be a classic, an extremely good film for children and adults alike.

710446,5,6303820905,"The Secret of Roan Inish is a unique film which reveals in a slow paced story, the relationship of the Irish people to the sea and land. Roan Inish weaves its magic through the well written dialogue of characters who tell the story of a family ancestor who was a mythological selkie, as well as the lost infant raised by seals who populate the abandoned island. They comment on the loss of native language and culture by a generation of young islanders who left for jobs in the city. The return of a small island girl to her grandparents permits director John Sayles to examine with the girl, the island's history, and its community whose knowledge is grounded in oral history and the past. Set in the post-war economy, desire to leave the old ways to incorporate benefits of modern urban life is seen only briefly as intrusive on the people whose community is intimately tied to the sea. The strength of the film is in how it presents the need and place of intergenerational knowledge, the preservation of the language, and the unique place of ethnic heritage based in oral traditions.

What sets this film apart from others is how it is a ""family film"" without resorting to clichs, but instead, is the kind of movie entertaining to all age groups without talking down to anyone. That the film was not better marketed is likely the fault of the studio that did not know how to sell the film's idea to American audiences grown accustomed to mindless car chases, exploding buildings, and gratuitous violence as well as irritating, smart-mouth kid actors. Roan Inish has none of these elements although the brief nudity of one child actor could offend some who would find offense in any presentation of the human form in any context. But for this, the film allows audiences to be drawn into the story of children who value and desire to restore their heritage and family, and take responsibility to act.

The production values of this film are high, its plot thoroughly believable. DP Haskell Wexler uses the beauty of the Irish countryside to paint a stunning image of the landscape and sea that makes one wish to return to the old sod. Sayles's cast are character actors not familiar to most audiences in the US, but who are able to carry the film with authenticity and grace. The child actors are especially mature and believable. This is a film that should be seen by more audiences but probably won't and that is unfortunate for The Secret of Roan Inish is a gem in a sea of mediocre Hollywood fare.  One of the finest family films for all libraries and an overlooked Sayles gem.",1134432000,11,2582,4.645514223194748

Moreover, its yet one more example of how mysticism has contributed to keeping the Irish impoverished as well as enslaved to England for 800 years.

Given the potential of the Irish mind, its disheartening to think how so much talent has been wasted in favor of religious ignorance. I can buy that Fiona's acceptance of mysticism is helpful in dealing with her loss. Its more the passing references to Christianity so deeply instilled in Irish culture that reminds us, once again, that its this festering ignorance that has kept us down for so long. On the other hand, when a civilization is endlessly oppressed, I suppose its difficult not to turn away from reason, or to never be given the chance to find reason in the first place.

710515,5,6303820905,"Set on the west coast of Ireland, overlooking the small island of Roan Inish, this John Sayles-directed film idealizes a family's connections to the sea and celebrates their sea-faring history and culture in the face of twentieth century ""progress."" Fiona, about ten, is sent to live with her grandparents there after her mother dies and her father is too grief-stricken to care for her. Some years earlier, in the same community, Fiona's baby brother Jamie had floated out to sea in his cradle, and her father and grandfather, unable to row fast enough to rescue him, had suffered that loss, too.

Fiona's participation in the seafaring life of her grandparents and cousin Eamon, exposes her to the legends and stories which have formed the backbone of her family culture. A relative tells her about ""the dark ones,"" members of her family thought to be descended from a selkie. This mermaid-like creature, part-human and part seal, is said to have borne several children by one of Fiona's ancestors before finding the hidden sealskin from which she had originally emerged. Putting on her old skin, she had obeyed the call of the sea, returning to her oceanic life and leaving her family behind.

Fiona, believing that her brother Jamie is living with the seals on Roan Inish, explores the island with her cousin Eamon, searching for her roots and Jamie. Jeni Courtney as Fiona will capture your heart. A beautiful child with a sense of innocence, Courtney has an instinctive sense of how to play her role without being cute, respecting the myths she is portraying and throwing herself wholeheartedly into her role. Mick Lally and Eileen Colgan, as the grandparents, inextricably tied the island and its way of life, give a sense of gravitas to supernatural events.

The cinematography (Haskell Wexler) is stunning--both interior cottage scenes and exterior scenes of the island, sea, fog, seals, and storms. Almost any shot could be freeze-framed as a portrait or landscape, its composition preserving the emotion and the meaning. The music, primarily flute, fiddle, and bodhran drum, perfectly captures the changing moods and enhances the unearthly mythology. With less gifted actors and direction, the plot of this film would be treacly fare, but Sayles, who also wrote the screenplay and did the editing, has created a brilliant film, memorializing a way of life and appealing to adults as well as younger audiences.

That's putting it mildly - Sayles, who is well known and respected for his film work (PASSION FISH, BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET, MATEWAN, BABY IT'S YOU, RETURN OF THE SEACAUCUS SEVEN', et al) has made a film here that, for me, will be in my top twenty for all time category.  When this film opened here in Austin, it stayed at the same theatre for months and months - and we saw it six or seven times during that period, never failing to be moved and entertained.
The story of young Fiona and her little brother Jaime is one that, without any gratuitous violence or sexual content, will captivate and enthrall viewers of all ages.  The setting, on an island off the Irish coast (transported from the Scottish equivalent in the original novel) is completely thrilling and beautiful. The power of the sea, the life of the people who draw their sustenance from it and from the land, the honesty and simplicity of the characters, the mystery and magic of old tales that might or might not be true (depending on your heart) - all of these elements are combined masterfully by Sayles, and wonderfully acted by his stunning cast.  The director's love and respect for his story and characters - and for the rural Irish people and their way of life - is so very evident from this work.

710604,5,6303820905,"Given his notorious reputation for cranking out the most politically-correct of films, it's a really pleasant surprise to watch this profoundly conservative effort by John Sayles.  Based on a 1959 novel by Rosalie Fry, Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry, Sayles' Roan Inish tells the story of a young girl, Fiona, who when her mother dies is sent to live with her grandparents on the Irish coast in the years immediately after WWII.  The family had long lived on the island of Roan Inish, in the company of seals, but they were relocated to Donegal during the war and now may have to move again, further inland.  There's an ineffable sadness about the old couple, the grandfather especially misses the island and mourns the lost way of life they enjoyed; the grandmother misses Fiona's brother, Jamie, who was swept out to sea in a wooden cradle when they were moving off of Roan Inish.  Fiona though is convinced that her baby brother still lives and, indeed, her cousin Eamon tells her that he's been sighted sailing around in his cradle boat.
Fiona's grandfather and cousins are only too happy to tell her tales about the family and Roan Inish, maintaining their strong ties to the island at least in memory and recitation.  Finally, one cousin, Tadhg--a ""dark one"" (dark of hair and eye like her brother was)--tells the story of how an ancestor captured a selkie, a seal-woman.  The selkies are said to swim ashore in seal form and then strip off their skins to bask in the sun as beautiful women, but if you can grab their skin before they slip away they are bound to you.  The family then is descended from this selkie, though one of her children eventually told her where to find the skin and she immediately swam off.
Fiona takes to visiting the island and spots Jamie herself, running naked and picking flowers, but he runs away and sails off in his cradle. She then convinces Eamon that the seals are keeping Jamie to make the family move back to the island, so the two set about secretly restoring the dilapidated huts and gardens, all the while trying to figure out how to coax the grandparents back to Roan Inish.
The film is beautifully shot, by Haskell Wexler, with a lilting Celtic soundtrack, and the cast, apparently professional but largely unknown here in the States, plays it straight down the line, as drama not fantasy.  Mr. Sayles never treats the audience as if we need convincing, nor stoops to treat the material ironically.  It is simply assumed that we will abandon reason and suspend disbelief, and we're quite happy to do so.  The whole is infused with a sentimental longing for tradition, a sense that life has a proper order and we our proper places in that order, and a disdain for change that is positively reactionary and very refreshing.  The viewer has no doubt that it is necessary for the Coneelly family, the descendants of the selkie, to live on Roan Inish and that the world is a better place with this balance restored.  It's all as anti-modern as can be and makes for a splendid old-fashioned movie experience, for the whole family or just for the adults.

I saw this when it first came out and loved it. Recently bought the video and watched it again. Still beautiful, achingly so, that rich and quiet Irish kind of beauty which strikes so deep into the soul. A deceptively simple tale---a young girl trying to solve the mystery of the disappearance of her baby brother during the evacuation of her ancestral island---made resonant by the power of the storyteller's voice. The contrast between the poverty of possessions and the richness of family relationships is striking, and it is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I know, with several truly spine-shivery, eerie moments, mostly in the sepia-tinted flashbacks. The soundtrack is equally beautiful, with authentic Irish airs and lullabies woven in and out to strengthen and support the storyline.
The little girl who plays Fiona does so with quiet grace, beauty, and a maturity of focus unusual in a child actor. The actor who plays her cousin Eamonn is less successful, I think, sounding rather self-conscious much of the time. The actors playing her grandparents are absolutely wonderful---and how often do we get to see older characters as the strong backbone of a movie, and not played for laughs or milked for pathos? Two other standouts: the slim, dark, feral, cousin-serval-times-removed, who provides Fiona with vital clues by relating an age-old family story, and the pre-Raphaelite-looking woman who plays Nuala, the selkie woman in the misty ancestral past, dark, wild-eyed, strange and beautiful.
I think that I love this film because of the whole Celtic edge-of-otherness kind of thing, but I cannot imagine most toddlers sitting through this one. But for older children, and for family viewing, this is one I'd recommend strongly.",1032307200,17,1916,5.264705882352941
710606,4,6303820905,"""The Secret of Roan Inish"" is underrated. Prime Irish storytelling in the form of a movie and a powerfully authentic Irish score are the foundation of a complex movie that will be replayed for decades.

Mick Lally gives an incredible performance as he tells Fiona, a young lass, the story of what Roan Inish has meant to him, and what had happened. In a pure and song-like brogue he brings to life her thoughts and dreams about what might be true.

Others about town tell her this and that, and she checks out the stories for herself.

On the surface, the movie presents a fantasy with whimsy. Underneath it all, we can see the change parts of Ireland's sea community has felt, what this means to the Gaelic language and old Irish culture. We see the syncretism of Roman Catholicism with Irish superstition, and the practical yet fulfilling lives of the people who once lived on Roan Inish.

Jeni Courtney, who plays Fiona, pulls off her role well, as do the other younger actors. There are a few parts in which I think the story asked us to make a few jumps, but in the end, the movie works.

In a spirit similar to ""Miracle on 34th Street,"" we have females characters, and a story to be appreciated at all ages. It strikes a note of traditional movie making in a way that this DVD will be replayed at many a Christmas holiday.

I recommend ""The Secret of Roan Inish.""

710637,4,6303820905,My seven-year-old daughter and wife and I were enthralled watching this movie. A great tale.  The acting isn't always great -- the kids are a bit stiff -- but the story transcends it.,1020556800,,183,4.545454545454546
710638,4,6303820905,"This film is truly a unique experience that never goes in quite the direction you expect it to.
Set in the rural Irish coast in the 1940's, it's full of pictueresque scenes and hauning beauty. Despite being about the experiences of a young girl, though, it's not sappy or sentimental at all. The score is sparse and only includes traditional Irish folk music. This lack of dross allows one to really appeciate the film's story.
I won't give it away, but it's a tale of magic woven into a very real world. Full of local colour without being trite and equally full of breatakingly engaging scenes full of mood and mystery.
The acting's fantastic, the scenery and cinematography very realistic and believable and the tale itself one that weaves its spell in subtle yet powerful ways.
If you're at all interested in Ireland and its mythology or if you're a nature lover, see it! If not, it's still worth a watch, as its power to enchant and haunt seems universal.",1015459200,10,959,4.647058823529412
710639,5,6303820905,"The family of young Fiona (Jeni Courtney) has been touched by tragedy.  Her mother has died and no one wants to talk about when her baby brother Jimmy drifted off to sea in his cradle.  Fiona is sent to live with her grandfather (Mick Lally) and grandmother (Eileen Colgan) on the coast across from the family's former home on the island of Roan Inish.  Everyone from her grandfather to the people she meets in towns have stories to tell young Fiona, about Roan Inish and the selkies, ""ceils"" who assume human form and can be captured if you but get their skins away from them.  Bit by bit Fiona puts the stories of her family and the local legends together until she and her cousin Eamon (Richard Sheridan) finally learn the secret of Roan Inish.
Director John Sayles and cinematographer Haskell Wexler have crafted a simple story, told in leisure about a young girl who believes in her heart long before she has evidence for her eyes.  Besides any film that involves a young man having to be tied between two cows for warmth after the sea refuses to drown him is obviously a film worth seeing.  Then there all those lilting Irish accents and their wonderful way of coming up with a phrase to describe each situation.  Add to this the wonderful soundtrack of Irish music and the captivating mystery and I do not think you will have to worry that the relatively slow pace of the film will lose the interest of your children.  They too will want to learn if their suspicions about the island's secret are correct.  ""The Secret of Roan Inish"" is a delightful family film, of the sort we will all agree they simply do not make enough of any more.",1013299200,12,1643,4.505050505050505
710640,4,6303820905,"This is just one of those fun movies where you can not wait to see what happens next. The theme centers around a lost person who many believe has been taken by mermaids and lives with them now. The show is not for someone who is looking for super special effects and that sort of thing, but it has a great idea behind the show. The story is for the most part quite interesting and kids and none judgemental adults who enjoy the simple pleasures of a decent movie will I believe enjoy this one very much.",1012348800,3,503,4.195876288659794
710641,5,6303820905,"This is not so much a review as a recollection, and I won't go into how I got to this website, but Secret of Roan Inish is among my top favorites. It has been a couple years since I have watched this video. but reading the other reviews urged me to write.
As I remember the story, John Sayles' Ireland is as much about shoreline, deep dark sea waters, as it is about rolling green hills (no Irish postcard pictures here). It's a blend of soaring seagulls and longing looks in a seal's eyes as it is about the choking air of factories and fish markets. It's about those same seagulls and seals watching us, eventually taking on a spirit function of guardians and guides. As much about a grandfather's faith in  his tales, as a skeptical grandmother's hidden hope that they are true.
This is not for the emotional mamby-pamby. A mother's longing to return to the sea is stronger than her agony to stay with a beloved husband and children. A family loses its risk of wading out in the pulling tide as it carries away the infant. Our child heroine endures chastising by family and strangers as she searches to regain familial wholeness.
It's also not for the impatient. The pace of the rural life is the pace of the story. But the story, visuals and sounds effectively keep us rooted. It's real life is not a fairy tale, but it invites us to believe.
This is a great gift for those whose taste runs to the spiritual",1007769600,4,1411,4.406130268199234
710642,5,6303820905,"A beautiful story, that captures the selkie legend with a touch of innocence.

John Sayles adapted Rosalie Fry's 1959 novel: Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry (That now sells for three to five hundred dollars!) Haskell Wexler captured the rolling emerald pastureland, clusters of white thatched cottages and the mist rolling in from the sea on film so delightfully, you will find yourself longing to visit Ireland.

Green is the color of life, hope and joy. In this delightful story, Fiona is full of life, hopes to find her brother and experiences the joy of helping her family in their time of need.

Fiona (Jeni Courtney) loses her mother and younger brother and is sent to live with her grandparents on the Irish Coast. From the cottage she sees Roan Inish, an island where her family once lived. Filled with curiosity, she seeks every opportunity to explore the tiny island. Tales of seals that can change out of their skin and take on a perfect human form makes her even more curious. She feels a magical connection with one of the seals she sees while on a fishing boat.

The selkie in this story is a beautiful woman who marries a mortal, yet pines for the sea. She is trapped on land without her seal skin, which her husband has hidden. Ledgend has it that one of her children told her where the skin was hidden and she immediately put it on and returned to the sea, leaving her family, home and husband behind forever.

Fiona takes all the stories and finds she is experiencing some of the magic of the legend in her own trips to the Island of Roan Inish. Like all children, she still believes in magic and even though her grandparents don't believe she has seen her brother, Fiona has
faith that she has not seen a ghost.

A lovely story to teach children kindness to animals and that no matter what happens in life, someone is always looking out for them.

This is a rare treat!

So this movie came as a big surprise to me.
I first saw it soon after its initial theatrical release and was immediately impressed.  The quality throughout the production made a definite, positive impact on me.
But, more than appreciating the technical proficiency with which this film was made, I see this as a beautiful story told with grace and love.
Having viewed it once more on video and a couple times more on DVD, I am amazed that this film has lost none of the magic it had for me that first time I saw it.
There is something wonderful in the simplicity shown here.  It makes clear that good story-telling can draw us in without relying on millions of dollars in special effects.  All that is required is a certainty of expressing the events and giving them the dramatic weight they deserve.

At first I watched it with my nine year old daughter, and we were totally enthralled by the mysterious tale that was carefully woven in front of our eyes.  Then we fell in love with what we were watching, and encouraged my husband and teenage son to watch with us the next night.  Even they loved it -- and it's hard to get a teenage boy to enjoy something like this.  A completely extraordinary movie that is uplifting, interesting, and totally unlike anything we have seen before.

710728,5,6303820905,"The Secret of Roan Inish is the perfect family movie. It's wonderfully entertaining, it's beautiful to look at, and it has magic and fun and mystery to it.
What makes this one most special, though is that it respects the intelligence of children. The girl this movie revolves around is a complete, thinking, emotional person. She unravels the ""secret"" mainly because she's determined and capable and thoughtful. The movie doesn't talk down to her *or* to kids in its audience. If you think about it, that's pretty rare in a movie. My son said it ""talked"" to him ""like people, not like a kid.""
If you have a little girl, please, buy her this movie. Roan Inish isn't particularly aimed at girls, or even at children -- it'll win almost anyone over. But it's incredible to see movie built around a little girl this way, with respect.
I would also recommend this movie to anyone who's enjoyed Local Hero. They're quite different films, but you'll understand the connection.",975628800,16,969,4.773809523809524

It was  filmed on the west coast of Ireland and the actors (and seals!) are Irish.  The accents are sometimes heavy and I found it helpful to switch on the  subtitles. Like many of Sayles films, there are many quiet moments of sheer  beauty. I would recommend this film to anyone, children and adults.

This magical story reunites a family on a small Irish island with little  more than a young girl's dream and some hard work by she and her cousin.
The lure of Ireland is hardly new, but the beauty of this sometimes  difficult land shines through the foggy mist that permeates the film.  It  is the financial hardships the Irish have often faced that create the  backdrop for this movie.  Some may say Sayles has romanticized penury, when  in reality he has simply shown what is most important to the human spirit -  that hard work can sometimes make dreams come true, and that faith and  magic are as important as tangible things.  The delightful acting and  strong characterizations bring the moody and mystical Irish coast to life.
Whether you are a fan of the selkie myth, Ireland, or are looking for a  film that you, your children, and your parents can watch together, I  heartily recommend this one.

710734,5,6303820905,"I love this film and I am so pleased to see it finally released as a DVD.  In frustration, I bought the soundtrack so I could at least listen to the beautiful music.
This is a mystical tale from the British Isles. The  tale could be Irish, Welsh, Scottish, or British--it's certainly Celtic.
A man discovers a seal is a ""silkie"" and one day when the  silkie slips out of her skin, he captures her. Silkies are seals with human  women inside.  They shed their skin to lie in the sun. When they do, if you  grab them before they can slip back into their skin they become your  prisioner.  All you have to do is keep the skin safely hidden and they can  not escape.
After the man captures the silkie, he marries her and they  have children.  One day, the silkie figures out how to escape and return to  the sea.  Once in the sea she is lonely for her children.  She wants to  have her life in the sea and her children. This puts the children ""at  risk"" from the land people's perspective.
The movie works on the  premise that a little girl is visiting her relaives and the older man tells  her the tale. The little girl being told the tale is descended from the  Silkie. The lure of the sea is explained as the longing of former sea  creatures for their mother.
Nothing happens to the little girl who is  told the tale, but something does happen to one of her child relatives  (Jamie?). This might frighten little children.  It's a typical European  fairy tale, and not everyone has the same fate. Even in Red Riding Hood  someone is eaten by the Wolf. No one is eaten in this film, but the event  that takes place might still be disturbing to an impressionable mind. I  debated whether or not my grand children could watch the film, and I think  if they are at least 8 or 9 it would be okay, though even the 9 year old  said it bothered her.",962409600,15,1839,4.234104046242774

Not everyone ""gets"" this movie.  It was lost on my brother, for  example, but me (and my husband) found it to be a lovely film.  It appealed  to the child in me, who still believes in magic.

The power of myth is that it remains beyond our grasp, it does not enter into our world but moves outside where it has the power to instruct and inspire us. It is  within our vision but lost to our touch. The myth in Roan Inish teaches  about belonging--and though the subdued, moody cinemtography and music are  wonderful, the plotting does move too slowly. With such stunning, languid  cinematography the storyline should have had a more snappy progression. The  acting was competent but stiff on the part of almost everyone but Fiona.  The actors sounded like they were reading lines rather than letting their  own sense of magic about the tale flow into their performances. The story  itself should have been far more moving, because the idea was great and the  myth could have had a ton of poignancy. The  impact was utterly ruined by  having the family actually take the lost child back at the end. The point  was that little Fiona's belief in the myth and her dreams of little Jamie  should have been enough to get her family to return in love to Roan Inish.  They did, but the ""reunion"" destroyed the sense of wonder. Myths  should remain ethereal and above our world...they should touch us only in  our hearts and our belief in the wondrous.
