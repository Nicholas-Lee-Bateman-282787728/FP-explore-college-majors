4659924,1,B005DI997O,Love it. Chayanne is hermosa. I'm learning a new language because of him. Spanish of course. The movie shows Chayanne range as an actor. He plays a vampire a lot different from his other characters.it has a good story line and nice music. For a Chayanne fan its a Most have to add to your collection. Five Stars......Esoooo,1413590400,,323,4.586206896551724

4659928,5,B005DI997O,I love every second of this novela is great that I know Spanish but even if I didn't the CDs have English subtitles. The story line is amazing and it left me wanting for more. The characters were perfect and considering the time when this was filmed the effects and story were very well developed.,1402963200,,297,4.418181818181818
4659929,5,B005DI997O,Great 11 episode series.  Good story line with a twist on vampires.  Watched it with subtitles as my Spanish isn't that good!,1396224000,,125,4.636363636363637
4659930,4,B005DI997O,First time seeing the novela and I like the storyline and characters. BUT whomever wrote the English subtitles needs to go back to school. In one scene Father Miguel is telling Gabriel that his brother committed suicide and in Spanish says NO PUDO TENER CRISTIANA SEPULTURA which means because he committed suicide he could not have a christian burial. The person that translated that line wrote HE COULD NEVER ACCEPT CHRISTIANITY AS A CULTURE!  wth kind of translation is that?! Don't they have professionals editing things like this?,1389484800,,535,5.079545454545454
4659931,5,B005DI997O,Excellent! It has a gift for my sister that loves chayanne (fan number 1) ..I think she really  enjoyed it!!,1383609600,,108,4.4
4659932,3,B005DI997O,"I had been wanting to get something with Chayanne in it, just to see how he was as an actor.  He did a decent job acting, and I would be happy to watch something else with him in it.  I found the series to be somewhat similar ""Angel"" starring David Boreanaz, but without the humor.  Towards the end, the plot and some of the supporting cast's acting got a little lame.  Gabriel's fate in the end was a surprise to me, though, which I liked.

The description for the DVD said it had scenes too racy for television, which is misleading.  There was only two scenes, and one didn't even have Chayanne in it, which was disappointing.  Between the two scenes, there is only about a total of 10 seconds that show anything racy.",1382918400,,720,4.3283582089552235
4659933,5,B005DI997O,"A very good series about vampires. I liked the story background about the Conquistador, Francisco Pizarro, as an evil vampire.",1381795200,,126,5.35
4659934,5,B005DI997O,"I love this movie, the cast is great and the film is very well directed. I enjoyed seeing it. Good work",1378684800,,103,3.9523809523809526
4659935,5,B005DI997O,"Una serie buensima, con una actuacin de Chayanne espectacular.
La trama, los efectos, todo lo que complementa esta serie en alta definicin, es de gran calidad. Desde el principio hasta el final n puedes dejar de mirarla.
La cancin de la banda sonora ""Amor inmortal"" interpretada por Chayanne, tambin  me fascina, ya que su voz, como interpreta las baladas, el sentimiento que pone y el amor en todo lo que hace, es un conjunto de cualidades que hace que todo sea digno de apreciar.
Totalmente la recomiendo",1375056000,,506,4.816091954022989
4659936,3,B005DI997O,"Gabriel, Amor Inmortal (Gabriel, Immortal Love - 513 minutes) Purchased from Amazon.com.

We start with a handsome fellow who has to avoid daylight. Even though he is played by heartthrob Cheyenne, I couldn't deny that Gabriel was a vampire!

The woman he loves, Eva, played by Angelica Celaya, is a nurse who keeps encountering odd corpses in her work at the hospital. You know...drained completely of blood, horrific, slashing wounds...

By the time we sort out her reincarnated persona, we realize that the vampire Pizarro, played by Jose Luis Rodriguez, wants to destroy her blood line because of a 500-year-old curse. This turned out to be unpredictable and satisfying. What a shocker!",1372982400,,690,5.142857142857143
4659937,5,B005DI997O,me encanto y gusto muchisimo.la compre porque chayane sale en la serie.no pense que me hiba a gustar tanto.una historia de amor  muy romantica llena de accion y suspenso tiene de todo un poco.el final me sorprendio muchisimo.espero con ansias una segunda temporada pues el dvd dice que esta es la primera temporada.la historia es muy linda y definitivamente triste tambien.la recomiendo a los que les gustan las series  paranormales con vampiros y todo eso .no se van arrepentir un producto bien hecho.,1372377600,,502,5.036144578313253
4659938,5,B005DI997O,"I gave it 5 stars for Chayanne  (really, do I have to explain?). The acting was solid. The storyline was imaginative.
I was expecting  a miniseries , so that was definitely win/win. I used the English subtitles and it helped me work
on my Spanish. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be watching again soon.",1366416000,,304,4.509090909090909
4659939,5,B005DI997O,had a great time watching it. I liked this movie because it was what I wanted. Yes i would recommend this to anyone.,1358380800,,116,4.086956521739131
4659940,5,B005DI997O,"A very different kind of vampire story. I was pleasantly surprised by this series. Chayanne gave a sexy and serious portrayal of Gabriel, a vampire tortured by the loss of his beloved wife. This was a romance with a twist, well done and worth a watch by anyone who loves the genre.",1356220800,,281,4.423076923076923
4659941,5,B005DI997O,"Gabriel did not disappoint, I am a new Chayanne fan and am very happy that this video had subtitles.  I am not a vampire lover but it was not overwhelming so that helped.  I think the actors were so great looking and Chayanne, in my opinion, is gorgeous.  I enjoyed the reviews that the others gave and made it easy for me to purchase this video.  My only disappoint is they have not done a sequence. I can only hope.",1350000000,2,417,4.175
4659942,5,B005DI997O,"More than a vampire series, it's a beautiful love story, it goes beyond life and death.  Excellent action scenes, plot, actors and actresses.  I specially loved Chayanne as Gabriel, mysterious, romantic.  Good translation from Spanish in the subtitles.

Me encant la serie, los actores y el argumento de un amor que va mucho ms all de la muerte.  Nada que ver con las otras pelculas de vampiros, esta es una novela romntica, donde uno se enamora una y otra vez del personaje de Gabriel. Adems Chayanne se ve guapsimo en ese papel y el Puma a pesar de hacer el papel de MALO se ve muy BUENO.  Las actrices son bellas y talentosas, las escenas emocionantes, me gust mucho.  La recomiendo.",1345680000,2,686,4.619834710743802
4659943,5,B005DI997O,"Received the Novela very quickly. Some of the scenes were a little cheesy but all in all they have come very far with this Novela. Very modern and updated. Would be nice to see more productions like this. Chayanne was beautiful and El Puma, well, what you can say is the man. Definitely recommend.",1339545600,2,297,4.518518518518518
4659944,5,B005DI997O,"This review is from a non-speaking Spanish person and one who does NOT like vampire movies at all, but loves Chayanne.  Gabriel is such a great story, once it starts to play, you find yourself being captivated, it has a way of drawing you in and never letting you go.  I am totally hooked and have only made it thru the 3rd episode.  This is such a good love story and Chayanne does an excellent job as well as all the other actors.  I too like the way they tied the past in with the present, which gives us a better understanding of why Gabriel is the way he is.  I started watching to see Chayanne, but then found myself watching to see how the story unfolds.  It does have English subtitles, so I could follow along with the story.  If you like Chayanne and/or vampire movies, you will not be disappointed.  The storyline is excellent and the quality of the DVD is outstanding, plus the Extras are a real treat.  I highly recommend it.",1338854400,3,938,4.314285714285714
4659945,5,B005DI997O,"I am so glad I found this DVD through Amazon.com! They make purchasing very convenient and easy with fast shipping. Gabriel is such a great story. I loved all the characters and especially Chayanne as Gabriel the vampire.  He is such a great performer! I don't speak Spanish (yet), but there are subtitles.  I liked the way they tied the past in with the present. Very romantic. If you love Chayanne and vampires, you need to get this DVD.",1337126400,4,439,4.544303797468355
4659946,5,B005DI997O,"Saludos! es la primera vez que tengo la oportunidad de ver a Chayanne y a Jose Luis Rodriguez el Puma actuando en una teleserie y me parece genial! con una interesante historia, ademas de una buena direccion, este box de 4 DVDS te hara pasar un buen rato! son 11 episodios de la teleserie aparte de un DVD de extras con entrevistas, escenas eliminadas, errores de grabacion, y 3 videos musicales (Chayanne - Amor Inmortal x2 versiones / Jose Luis Rodriguez el Puma - Dueo de todo)",1299542400,6,480,4.528735632183908
4659947,4,B005DI997O,"I haven't watched the whole series yet, but I've watched a large chunk of it. I hadn't seen this on DVD when Amazon recommended it for me. It does come with English sub-titles, so I am watching this with a non-Spanish speaking friend who loves not only Chayanne but vampires too! I don't want to ruin any story lines, suffice to say that I do recommend it!",1289779200,4,356,4.3283582089552235
4659948,4,B005DI997O,"I love this DVD! Chayanne and Jose Luis Rodriguez did an excellent work. This is like the Hispanic version of True Blood or Twiglight (love, action and such a romantic story). Hopefully it will be a 2nd season soon! Can't wait!",1285977600,6,227,4.560975609756097
4659949,5,B005DI997O,"I really enjoyed this DVD because first I am a very big fan of Chayanne, second I like scary, ghost and vampire stories. This story gave you history behind the vampires, how they live. Gabriel is very different from the other Telenovelas I've watched. It was more fast pace, dramatic, and action packed. It didn't end happily ever after but did make me wonder if there could be a sequel.

4659950,5,B005DI997O,Ofcourse I love Chayanne...Now I want more I hope they keep this going how...they will come up with something...I was not expecting the ending to be honest I was shocked but they did leave it open for a continuation...,1276128000,3,218,4.615384615384615
4659951,5,B005DI997O,"I got this for a friend, she does not speak Spanish, but loves Chayanne. The information does not say it here, but there are english subtitles for this on the dvd's. When I saw there were subs, I decided to watch with my friend. I have been pleasantly surprised at the storyline and the quality of the sfx. The whole family is hooked. If you are a Chayanne fan, then get this or if you like neo vampire stories, with a lot of good looking people in it, then you will like this too.",1268697600,29,481,4.127659574468085

8466846,5,B005DI997O,"I bought this because Chayanne was on it and it was a vampire story which I love. I didn't realize it didn't translate to an English version when I bought it. Thank goodness for the English subtitles, I was able to watch the series and understand what was going on. Lol. The series was very good, original and entertaining. My first Spanish movie ever. Chayanne is so gorgeous in here as a vampire and all. I only wish that this series had a sequel to it. I enjoyed watching this and didn't want it to end.",1472256000,,506,4.28125

8466851,5,B005DI997O,I don't  speak Spanish but I enjoyed this series very much.  Getting used to the sub-titles took very little effort and became second nature quickly. I just adore Chayanne and his music and was pleasantly surprised by his acting ability.  The story line is not your usual vampire plot.  He was turned against his will and knows he will not go to Heaven to be with his wife and child but he tries everything he can to be good and to earn that right.
