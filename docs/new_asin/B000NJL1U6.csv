8178225,5,B000NJL1U6,"This wasn't my Dad's unit; but the young pilots in this film (made at the time it was happening) were doing the same kind of job my father and his friends were doing, so it's valuable in helping me get a clearer picture than words alone could give me of their day-to-day experiences flying the Thunderbolt in combat in Europe--specifically, in Italy.  (My Dad flew at about the same time in Southern France.)  It gives me things to look for in the written sources, and a ""grid"" for interpreting some of what Dad did--and didn't--say, about his experiences in combat.  It's not a replacement for well-done cinematography like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Enemy at the Gates"" or ""Dresden,"" but it is valuable for its authenticity and its closeness to the events and experiences it documents.  I'm very glad I have it.",1407024000,,812,4.73758865248227
8178226,5,B000NJL1U6,"Excellent! The movie I was looking for was actually the one that, on this DVD is called ""Operation Thunderbolt"". I was very pleasantly surprised to find that movie, plus four other great war movies also included on this disc! The quality is good, remastered newsreel footage. I am enjoying this DVD even more than I had expected. If you like watching footage of the damage that is done by the eight .50 caliber machine guns of a P47 thunderbolt, you will love this!",1357516800,,465,4.614457831325301
