8587450,5,B00CY7SVUI,"I've seen a lot of documentaries about rock bands, punk bands in particular, East End Babylon is definitely one of the better ones. It chronicles the history of London's East End, from before WW2 to present day, while simultaneously telling the story of it's greatest punk band, the Cockney Rejects. The band that started Oi!
The story of the Rejects is a lot more unique than that of the typical band. Their story isn't about heroin or petty grievances between band members, it's about working class identity, brawling, West Ham United and most of all brotherhood. It's an underdog story. The Rejects weren't sons of diplomats like Joe Strummer or artsy bohemians like Patti Smith. They were poor kids from council houses. They had almost Dickensian childhoods. They were boxers and ICF hooligans, and they brought all of that rowdiness into the world of punk like no band before or since. That's not to say they were brainless thugs or bullies though, far from it. Jeff and Mick Geggus, the two leading members of the band, are actually quite articulate and charming. They're funny, knowledgeable, and good to their mother. They're great protagonists of a great story. You don't have to be a punk rocker or West Ham supporter to like these guys. My dad even liked them and he's an old hippie.

 I'd recommend this documentary to pretty much anybody. 10/10",1494460800,,1357,4.844827586206897

8587455,5,B00CY7SVUI,"The Cockney Rejects were always one of my favorite UK punk bands from the 80's. this is a well made doc showing the roots of this under rated band. I know people from NY, Boston or Chicago don't want to hear it but the best hardcore bands came from London or LA. The biggest crowds for punk shows were in LA. It was cool that the Rejects acknowledged the mistake they made at their LA debut. I was there and what a disappointment that show was. This is coming from someone that actually likes their rock albums.
That said this is a great doc.
