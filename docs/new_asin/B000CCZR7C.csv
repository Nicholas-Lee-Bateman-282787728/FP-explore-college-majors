8097755,4,B000CCZR7C,"MADACY's FRIGHT FEST: NIGHTMARE IN A BOX features ten public domain horror movies on five double-sided DVDs. All are stored in a sturdy folding case that's packed within a nicely decorative tin box. Transfer quality, while not pristine, is acceptable and the films themselves are consistently good; there's even a few genuine classics here.

SYNOPSES--

THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI--  Hunchbacked Dr. Caligari's sleepwalker predicts deaths hours before they occur. German Expressionist cinema at its finest. The use of pioneering camera techniques, distorted buildings, an eerily atmospheric story and bizarre last reel plot twists make this one unforgettable!

DEMENTIA 13--  Roger Corman's young assistant Francis Coppola was allowed to make this right after he finished 2nd unit work on Corman's latest film. It's the story of a tragedy-plagued family living in a creepy old Irish castle.

DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE--  Scientist creates a potion that frees his inner demon but is lost when the monster starts taking  over at will. Nine decades later, this first full-length treatment of the famous R.L. Stevenson story remains one of the best.

HORROR HOTEL--  British-made film about a co-ed doing occult research in New England who finds herself marked for sacrifice by a witch's coven. Nicely atmospheric b&w film.

HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL--  A wealthy man and his wife invite five guests to spend the night in a mansion where several murders have already been committed; whoever survives will be rewarded $10,000. Julie Mitchell (Ruth Bridges) is Robert's sister.

THE LAST MAN ON EARTH--  A virus has swept the planet, transforming all but one lone scientist into blood-seeking zombies. He spends the days harpooning these creatures, while nights pass in pure terror, as he barricades his home against a demonic onslaught. One of Vincent Price's strangest efforts.

NIGHTMARE CASTLE--  Barbara Steele in a dual role. A jealous husband heinously murders his cheating wife and her lover, then takes up with his half-crazy sister-in-law. The spirits of his two victims return to exact revenge upon him. Color photography employed to good effect here. Soundtrack music by Ennio Morricone.

NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD-- Johnny and Barbara visit a rural Pennsylvania town to see their father's gravesite. While there, Johnny is attacked and killed, and Barbara flees to a nearby farmhouse where a group of terrified people are in hiding After dark, their supposedly safe haven is beseiged by an army of cannibalistic zombies. Director George Romero appears briefly as a Washington reporter.

NOSFERATU--  An unauthorized retelling of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Vampire Count Orlok makes victims of an unsuspecting realtor and his wife who are visiting the Count's creepy castle. (In the 1920s, Bram Stoker's heirs tried but failed to have all copies of Nosferatu seized and destroyed.)

THE TERROR--  Roger Corman partly directed this nightmarish and somewhat confusing tale of a French Army officer who follows a beautiful woman to a creepy castle owned by a creepier old Baron.

8097756,1,B000CCZR7C,"About a year ago, I bought this tin set thinking how great it would be to have this collection of old horror movies, especially the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. I had to put them aside for a while because I kept on getting tied up with other things, but finally this Halloween I decided now was the opportunity I'd been waiting for. I opened up the tin, popped in the DVDs, and my nightmare began...but it had nothing to do with the scary movies purportedly on them.

Every single last DVD in this collection is broken in some way. On most of them, I can watch the first movie, but the movie frequently stuttered or paused between some scenes. The second movie could in NO WAY be accessed from a standard DVD player, leaving half of each DVD useless. On the third DVD, neither selection was playable at all.

If it had been a single DVD with a problem, I might have chalked this up to duplication error. Things like that happen. But to have an entire set of DVDs this screwed up...that bespeaks absolutely shoddy and incompetent workmanship.

Whatever you do, don't throw away your money on this set, and I'd advise you not to get near anything else that Madacy puts out if this is an example of a ""deluxe set"".",1194048000,6,1207,4.403587443946188
8097757,5,B000CCZR7C,"This is the collection all us die-hard horror fans have been waiting for. It contains all the neccessaries that were hard to find on DVD before this (Nosferatu, Dr. Caligari, Night of the Living Dead) and some must-haves, such as Horror Hotel and House on Haunted Hill.

The packaging is unbelievable. As if the thick, tin case wasn't enough, they give us 5 DVD's (2 movies per) and put them in a foldable case inside the tin box. Very complex and fancy packaging.

I would HIGHLY recommend this set to any fan of horror, or any film buff interested in the roots.",1136592000,7,563,4.509803921568627
