5927861,5,B00EMN0COA,"I have another DVD of Fourplay and it was very enjoyable, so i was hesitant that this DVD would be only more of the same. However I really like the group and was interested in the new member (Loeb) so i purchased it anyway.  I was not disappointed, because this DVD highlights even more of the abilities of this multifaceted group. Fourplay is the ""bar"" that has been set for contemporary Jazz.
As an aside, the first disc i received had a manufacturing defect. Amazon's return procedure and fast replacement was painless. five stars for Fourplay and Amazon.",1387497600,,558,4.6938775510204085

5927863,4,B00EMN0COA,"Bob James and Fourplay continue to be my favorite Jazz group.  Their concerts show off their great talent.  I have all of their concert DVD's and CD's, and keep waiting for more.  I would give it 5 stars, but this concert was way too short, it seemed like there was material edited out of this DVD.

5927894,3,B00EMN0COA,"Huge Jeff Beck fan here.  In terms of uniqueness he's in my opinion #1.  There are tons of guys who can play similar to say Hendrix, SRV, Vai, Van Halen, Clapton and Page.  But, have you ever heard a guy play like Beck?  No way.  His style is so unique and unorthodox it's really difficult to play like him.  Anyway, back to the DVD review....... the performance was a bit flat in my opinion.  There was less band member to band member interaction....less audience to band member interaction.....body language of Beck told me he wasn't as into it as he was at Ronnie Scott's DVD (or Crossroads show).  ""Big block"" was one of the few songs worth listening to.  If Ronnie Scott's DVD is a 4 star this DVD is 2-3 stars.",1475452800,,716,4.363636363636363

5927900,4,B00EMN0COA,"OK a great show but not as great as Performing This Week at Ronnie Scott's. Because the two exist I have to compare them and this one is the loser. Where Ronnie Scott's snakes confidently into the sublime and stays there, the Tokyo show is more playful, bouncy and a little haphazard.  It's not amazing considering the difference in venue size, but it is what it is.",1465171200,,366,4.462686567164179

5927919,5,B00EMN0COA,"Theres been some great reviews written on this already so Im giving an overview of all three of his fairly recent discs. Ive now watched all of them ALOT on a 65""Vizio and listened on Adcom,Yamaha,Oppo,Klipsch surround.(blu-ray).The song selection is pretty similar on Ronnie Scotts and Japan. The song with the Middle Eastern flavor on Japan makes a great case for the added guitar player and is worth the addition of this disc,all by itself. Ronnie Scotts is far more in your face and intimate. Lots of smiles and blistering musicianship;I mean Vinnie Coilutta!!!.Rock and Roll Party is COMPLETELY different and absolutely essential if only because Emelda May is give some WONDERFUL material to sing. Fantastic horn section and guest appearance by Gary U.S.Bonds is bonus!!Japan is a huge stadium show with a respectful audience,the other 2 are club shows. All 3 could not POSSIBLY sound or look better. All 3 feature musicianship of the highest order. If you're a big Jeff Beck fan you should have all 3. WAYYYY cheaper than a ticket for the show;how can you go wrong...its a no brainer. I couldn't choose one over the other;they all are very different. If I had to,Ronnie Scotts.",1452902400,4,1183,4.92

5927973,5,B00EMN0COA,"Given the fact that ""Performing This Week ... Live at Ronnie Scott's"" was such a high-profile and universally acclaimed live set (and justifiably so), it's almost impossible to view ""Live In Tokyo"" without drawing some comparisons. That doesn't mean you have to decide that that ""Ronnie"" is a ""better"" show, or vice-versa. It's still Jeff Beck, he's still at a peak in terms of prowess, it's still a nice career-spanning overview of his work.

What's different is the band, for starters, as well as the venue. There was a certain level of warmth, from Jeff''s own stage presence to the interplay between the band members, to the obvious small club ambiance on ""Ronnie"" that you aren't going to find here. And that's OK...that show was a chapter, not the whole story.

At the beginning of this show, Beck...wearing shades...struts out onto the stage, shredding as he goes. That's in stark contrast to the no-shades, smiling, greeting the audience Beck who opened the ""Ronnie"" show. We go from a small club to a mega-hall, and yes...let's get this out of the way up front...Tal Wilkenfeld created a magic in the ""Ronnie"" band that is replaced by the technically proficient but perhaps less charming Rhonda Smith. He's also got a second guitarist (Nicolas Meier) which is not the norm. Finally, ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"" in ""Ronnie"" was a more soft-spoken performance, primarily offered as a bookend for Tal's fluid bass solo. Here, it's closer to the ""Blow By Blow"" original.

When it comes to choosing material, Jeff's tastes can be hit or miss, buy boy, did he HIT when he decided to cover the Mahavishnu Orchestra's ""You Know You Know."" It's just killer, with its slightly menacing pacing...perfect for Beck. Jimi's ""Little Wing"" is a little tougher than Clapton;s version, but it also has a softer side. Because he was touring behind ""Emotion & Commotion,"" you get some of his newer material, but he also serves up the creme de la creme like ""The Pump"" and ""Blue Wind.""

The only thing that could possibly get in the way of your enjoying the daylights out of this is that if you insist on comparing it, unfavorably, to the ""Ronnnie"" DVD. Don't do that. It's too good to mess up with comparisons.",1432771200,,2201,4.799472295514512
5927984,5,B00EMN0COA,"I bought this as a preview to seeing Jeff Beck live in Portchester, NY on April 22nd. It was good to see a DVD followed by a live performance.

5928036,2,B00EMN0COA,"This is hard to say,  being a Jeff Beck worshiper.

Jeff set his own bar impossibly high with Live at Ronnie Scott's.  This video falls far short in every way,  evaluated on its own and compared to Ronnie Scott's. I won't watch it again.  I wasted  $10 and a couple of hours.

Visually this video was just plain uninteresting.  There was little interaction between members of the band,  or between the band and the audience.  I don't recall seeing much expression if any on Jeff's face.  Another reviewer said it looked like he was asleep,  and I agree.

Worse, musically it wasn't interesting.  This line up just didn't suit my tastes. I felt Jeff needed a live keyboard player,  instead of using prerecorded keyboard music. I found myself not even paying much attention after a while. I will say the encore was the best part but still unimpressive.

Obviously based on the ratings others liked this video and I respect their opinions. I just don't agree.  If you can get just one music video, get Live at Ronnie Scott's.",1422748800,4,1022,4.620111731843576

5928056,5,B00EMN0COA,"Beck strikes out with a new band for this concert filmed at the Tokyo Dome City Hall in April, 2014.  Joining Beck are Swiss guitarist Nicolas Meier, drummer Jonathan Joseph and Canadian bassist Rhonda Smith.  Curiously Ms. Smith resembles Beck's former bass player, Tal Wilkenfeld in not only her playing, but her looks and facial expressions.

While this venue likely qualifies as large, the set plays much smaller.  Perhaps due to the acoustics or the audience or just the feel of the band.  Beck is at his best and tackles diversified pieces from Hendrix, John McLaughlin, Billy Cobham, Charles Mingus, Jan Hammer, Lennon and McCartney, Stevie Wonder, Muddy Waters as well as some of his own material (""Hammerhead,"" ""Big Block"").  At age 70, he's still at the top of his game.  His bandmates play like they've been with him for years, each getting a chance to shine.  This concert has no chit-chat and no singing other than a little vocalization from Smith and Joseph on a couple songs.

The Blu ray comes with a 1080i video resolution and 2.0:1 aspect ratio, both a bit unusual.  The stage has no ornamentation and appears in a stark background devoid of color.  This isn't a problem most of the time as the black levels are very good.  On some of the more distant shots of the whole band there does appear to be a bit of a drop off.  Still, close ups look very detailed.  The disc comes with 2 lossless audio tracks and they are both terrific.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and is very immersive, providing a your-are-there feel of the auditorium, especially when cranked up.  The LPCM 2.0 sounds great also.  I played both in my home theater at different times and then the stereo mix in a different 2 channel set up.  The 2 channel option will obviously collapse the sound and provides more directionality, but I preferred the 5.1 which is more substantial and elevates the mids and low end.  This is always a choice for the viewer/listener.  The only extras are a 15 minute commentary by Beck and others about the setlist choices and another short piece where the bandmates talk about each other.  Highly recommended.  Here's the set list:
 1) Loaded
 2) Little Wing
 3) You Know You Know
 4) Hammerhead
 5) Angel (Footsteps)
 6) Stratus
 7) Yemin
 8) Where Were You
 9) The Pump
 10) Medley: Goodbye Pork Pie Hat / Brush With The Blues
 11) You Never Know
 12) Danny Boy
 13) Blue Wind
 14) Led Boots
 15) Corpus Christi
 16) Big Block
 17) A Day In The Life
 18) Rollin' And Tumblin'
 19) Cause We Ended As Lovers

5928057,5,B00EMN0COA,"Excellent concert and production values. With a new band of top players behind him, Beck proves once again he's both a great musician and a great showman. ""Loaded"" ""You Know, You Know"" ""Stratus"" and ""Big Block"" are highlights. Put this one together with the ""Live at Ronnie.

5928064,5,B00EMN0COA,"A staggeringly prolific performance, and the most beautifully filmed concert I have ever played.  It's a rock show, it's a symphony, it's an opera... it's wonderful.  When I saw this version of the group live last summer, I was a little worried about the absence of keyboardist Jason Rebello, and while I do hope to see him back in the fold, I was very impressed at Nicholas Meier's ability to play the keyboard parts on his guitar-synth, and also take fabulous guitar solos on his composition Yemeni and on other tunes.  His rhythm guitar added some new dimension to JB standards like A Day in the Life and also on the super-creative and poignant cover of Little Wing.  Jonathan Joseph is superb on drums, and while I think his comparisons to Cobham may be a little premature, he is powerful, articulate, delightful.  My only complaint is that I feel his drum solo on Stratus isn't mastered up high enough on the recording; or maybe it's just my system.  Rhonda Smith is smokin' hot... I can't get enough of her.  What a masterful player.  As for Jeff, he is a great gift for all of us that have been so malnourished on the jazz-fusion diet in recent years.  I love the cover of You Know You Know.  He would never try to show up McLaughlin, but if you go and listen to The Boston Record, you can see that he does anyway.  One suggestion for him:  I love Brush With the Blues, but we  can also handle the full version of Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.  Nobody does it better!  So... buy the Blu Ray, and if you have a chance to see JB and this great group, DO IT!",1420156800,5,1554,4.347222222222222

A lot of them blow all of us away(my personal fave is Buckethead). But, when it comes to the whole picture, I mean the WHOLE picture; Jeff Beck is definitely ""da man."" Who else has the already secure place in history, that he continues to impressively add to, as he moves in to the sixth decade of his career. This DVD is evidence to all that. Sure there has been some quibbling about the aspect ratio and the black bars at the top and bottom and blah, blah. C'mon, who really cares. Jeff and his superlative band absolutely smoke! His playing is the usual masterful mix of emotion, melody, aggression and mind boggling technique. His sound is totally unique. The set list is well chosen and visually I kind of like the widely composed, arena stage shots. Don't worry there are plenty of close ups.

5928096,5,B00EMN0COA,"Jeff Beck Tokyo Live showcases the greatest rock guitar player still stretching the envelope of emotional guitar melodic sounds from worldwide cultural influences cleverly never far from the blues rock roots of his youth. Supported by enthusiastic world class stage veterans Jonathan Joseph drums, Rhonda Smith , bass, and Nicolas Meier guitar and midi, Jeff Beck wanted this Japanese venue to contrast his previous small club Ronnie Scott s Platinum selling  video to a larger rock concert feel without all the hollering and  hoopla of a typical arena rock concert as Japanese audiences no matter how large as in this sold out Tokyo Dome, are attentive and into the music while politely showing their enthusiasm. The set list runs the gamut from the familiar engine driven hard twangs of Big Block through nee uncharted Mid Eastern flavored The Pledge to the angelic and voted number one slow instrumental of all time by Rolling Stone, ""Cause We ve  Ended As Lovers"" and ends with guess what....yes another new song the funky ""Why Why Give it Away"".

5928101,5,B00EMN0COA,"Just watched.... and I'll get my minor complaint out of the way first.... The director wanted to show that Jeff plays large venues and not the small clubs featured in his last two video projects (blu ray from Ronnie Scotts and the Les Paul tribute from New York) ... so he filmed this in an expansive arena in Tokyo ..... which is terrific, but to make things seem larger in scale this is presented in the extreme widescreen aspect ratio of 2:35 .... great for large western films shown in movie theatres and rather stupid for a product primarily to be enjoyed on home theaters .... also known as televisions!  So we get the old black bars ... this time top and bottom, often cutting into the guitar or Mr Becks head but more often just not filling the screen for no other reason than some arteeests whim. THAT out of the way on to the Blu Ray.

First... the other two projects on Blu Ray had a wealth of spectacular bonus features... this disc has a couple of small and servicable bonus features about the set list and band that are informative and welcome but not the multi watchers like the previous discs.  The show is spectacular and loud and bombastic and thrilling!  Jeff Beck does seem to get better with age and unlike the adored but sloppy Page or the controlled Clapton .... really walks the edge of the knife.  So many of the performances on their own would warrant the purchase price of about 15 bucks beginning with a startling version of Hendrix classic ...Little Wing. This is a kick butt band and once I stopped noticing the black bars top and bottom and just let the music take me ...... the word that keeps coming to mind is ... ridiculous!

I'd deduct a star for the aspect ratio .... but that would still leave me 10 on a scale of 1 -5..... Beck is all over his Fender guitar and his fingerpicking extraordinary. If you are a fan , this will likely be the one you've been waiting for..... the Ronnie Scotts program was a bit more jazzy fiddly to me , the Les Paul tribute one of my desert Island Blu Rays.... but NOT classic Jeff Beck.... this seems to be the closest thing to the real El Becko!  Turn it UP!  And while I dream , what about a Jeff Beck Group reunion project?",1416960000,5,2196,4.339024390243902
5928102,5,B00EMN0COA,"Wow. I was expecting greatness from this and it delivers in spades! 90 minutes of rock, jazz, blues, funk, techno, electronica and ballads. Great band, Jeff, Rhonda Smith, Nicholas Meier and Jonathon Joseph. Beck is seemingly even more incredible than on the 'Live at Ronnie Scotts' Blu-ray. Video quality is very good considering the darkened concert stage Closeups on the performers and their instruments look beautiful on my plasma. Also, this video is not a complete 16x9 (1.78:1) aspect ratio. It has black bars above and below the image, I would say more like 2:20:1 aspect . I love it in that the stage is big and the aspect ratio used allows for some wonderful compositioned shots. It's also full 1080p. Well done. The 5.1 lossless DTS-MA  track here is amazing! One of the best I've heard. Great dynamics and with a higher end set-up, you will be rewarded. Aces! There's also a 2.0 PCM stereo track which I'm guessing is equally as good. At the current price, order this if you're a fan (even if you're not). Thank you Jeff...",1416873600,41,1035,4.718232044198895
5928103,5,B00EMN0COA,Another reference quality Blu-ray from a legend.  State of the art on every level.  The level of musicianship and talent here is beyond description.  A superb performance that showcases the band as well as Jeff.  You will not be disappointed.,1416787200,24,242,4.975
5928104,5,B00EMN0COA,"This DVD filmed in Japan reveals to peers and fans that Jeff Beck remains the most virtuosic, creative and eclectic fretboard master of all. There are many new songs that were not featured on the ""Live At Ronnie Scott's DVD. This includes the blistering industrial laden ""Loaded"" that would have been a great fit on the ""Jeff"" CD. ""Nine"" showcases Beck's mastery of rock, jazz and techno brilliance fused in the same song. ""Yemin"" is an absolutely exotic, intricate and exquisite gem that was first played when Jeff was touring with Brian Wilson in 2013. ""Danny Boy"" is a major highlight in addition to being one of the most emotive and sensitive songs on the DVD. ""Why Give It Away"" features Rhonda Smith's vocals and the song is replete with funk, soul and rock. ""Corpus Christi Carol"" is very tender and yearning as Beck adroitly uses long, swooping, sustained tones resplendent with pathos. ""Hammerhead"" is a Grammy Winning hard rock song featuring Beck's otherworldly riffs. He also manages to deliver an amazing rendition of his late friend Jimmi Hendrix's ""Little Wing"". ""You Know, You Know"" is a jazz fusion classic wondrously showcasing Beck's complete mastery of that musical genre. Many of the remaining songs are a virtual best of Jeff Beck. These include ""Big Block"", ""Rollin and Tumblin"", ""Brush With The Blues"" ""Led Boots"" the gorgeous ""Angel(footsteps)"", the majestic "" A Day In The Life"", the ethereal ""Where Were You"" and the heartrending ""Cause We've Ended As Lovers"". This DVD is further proof that Jeff Beck is the ultimate master of his craft. He flawlessly displays his inimitable skills and prowess at playing rock, jazz fusion, blues, funk, techno and especially his yearning instrumental ballads,  Jeff Beck is the most spellbinding and captivating live guitarist. His diverse, celestial and prodigious tones are even more audibly enjoyable than any great vocalist can be.

 Note. This DVD gives the viewer a chance to see how exemplary Jeff's band is. Rhonda Smith on bass, Jonathan Joseph on drums and Nicolas Meier as the accompanying guitarist.",1416787200,74,2074,5.058479532163743
5928105,5,B00EMN0COA,"Synopsis from Eagle Rock Entertainment: Jeff Beck is undeniably one of the worlds greatest guitar players. Technically brilliant, he is renowned for pushing musical boundaries and has excelled across many different genres from rock and jazz to pop and blues. Live In Tokyo was filmed at the Tokyo Dome City Hall in Japan on April 9th this year. These Japanese dates were the first to feature Jeff Becks new backing band of Jonathan Joseph (drums), Nicolas Meier (guitars) and Rhonda Smith (bass) and the setlist includes some material from his new, as yet unreleased, studio album. In contrast to Becks previous visual releases, both filmed in small clubs, Live In Tokyo is filmed in a major concert arena and has a very different, more expansive feel. Jeff Beck is a true guitar legend and this show captures him at his very best.",1412035200,39,831,4.859154929577465

5928109,5,B00EMN0COA,"Hello, I have been fan of this super group since many years ago, and I think this Tokyo event is  an  awesome project.....

After all, jazz is test, practice and even improvisation.

If someone did not like it, too bad, remember: ""He who makes no mistakes, usually does not do anything.""

Fourplay, go ahead, I'll go to you.

5928110,2,B00EMN0COA,"I love Fourplay and their music but this is the first DVD I bought and I was rather disappointed. What is so really great with their studio albums is missing when they have to do ""everything"" in realtime on stage. I'll stick to the CD:s...",1398988800,2,239,4.333333333333333
5928111,5,B00EMN0COA,Just when you think that this group  can't get any better they just do.  This is a really terrific DVD.  I sure hope in the future they release this on CD. The Orchestra was just great.  And Winchester Lady was the proper song to close this show with. You would only be making your DVD collection outstanding with this purchase.,1395446400,,328,4.416666666666667
5928112,5,B00EMN0COA,"This is one of Fourplay's best videos! Their music fits in well with an orchestra and the video shows this, but it also shows how well they play on their own. We have yet to be disappointed by any of their DVD's or CD's!",1393027200,,220,4.0227272727272725

8606893,4,B00EMN0COA,"Good but not great show.  I thought the video PQ was little grainy and washed out.  Far from the best PQ I've seen in a concert video.  Probably could have been fixed in post production.  And speaking of post production, does that ambient keyboard sound in about half the songs really come from the ""rhythm"" guitarist?  Jeff's guitar thru my 5.1 system was firmly in the front left channel and was much louder than any other instrument in any other channel.  Considering that Jeff was on one side or the other of 70 years old, his performance was amazing.  The things he does with his thumb, bottom 2 strings and the whammy bar is unbelievable.  Glad to have been able to add this show to my Blu-ray concert collection.",1498608000,,719,4.51937984496124
