That led me to believe the DVD was on a topic I was researching -- the FALL of France in 1940. It contained nothing of the sort. Rather, it was about the LIBERATION of France in the summer 1944 and afterwards. There must be 393 pieces of artwork that would have suggested the liberation. Indeed, I think I'm safe in saying Hitler and liberation don't even go together.",1427760000,,481,4.540229885057471
8118718,2,B000F7MJP2,"Well I bought this DVD thinking that it might be what it seems to be on the cover, that is, a history of France in World War Two. But alas, that is not what the contents reveal.

This should be retitled Archival clippings of the American Liberation of France. The first part of this 58 minute documentary is obviously quite old. It seems to be from a rather gung ho documentary made I'm guessing in the 1950s. There is an obvious emphasis on general Eisenhower's view of the war. Very little is seen from the French point of view. Even the amount of time spent on the resistance is about 2 minutes. The rest is from the post-D-Day period. Quite superficial at that.

Then without warning one the stock turns to color and we are in a cheaply made documentary, probably from the 80s, with Eliot Gould narrating a short segment about the Red Ball Express. The American supply lines for the same period.

So what that means is that there nothing about the causes of the war, the French German relationship, The French failure to protect France, the ocupation, the Vichy Government, the Jewish deportations, The resistance, D-Day, Or what happened after the Americans arrived.

In short THIS IS NOT ABOUT FRANCE IN WORLD WAR TWO. It is merely dated footage about the American Forces in France during a brief period. Quite misleading.

There are a few pluses though... Better footage of the Paris Liberation than appears in the World At War, lots of other footage that doesn't appear elsewhere. But if you are a student of French History forget it. It's just a disorganized chapter of US military history.",1165795200,,1599,4.6761565836298935
