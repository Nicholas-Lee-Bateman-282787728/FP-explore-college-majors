7902273,5,B0000031EA,"Some may find this a bit hokey (after all it is for small children) but my 3 1/2 year-old son loved it from the minute he saw it. It's live-action, and children sing Christian songs. The children also tell Psalty about problems they have and Psalty explains how God works in their lives to help them.
