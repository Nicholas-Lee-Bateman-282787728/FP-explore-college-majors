8480655,5,B005NMD1M4,"I have a lot of DVD's and Blu Rays. I've been collecting them for many years now, about 10 years to give an actual figure. And I have yet to see anything like this produced in the American market. When i first got this blu ray, I was surprised by the over all quality of the case and it's production. In my findings, optical media that isn't produced for the American market (meaning not written in english) tends to be substandard. I have a number of discs that seem to be nothing more than computer printed inserts for dvd cases. I have others that seem to be bootlegs, though I cannot confirm it.

And that doesn't surprise me, there is nothing like the American Hollywood machine. We have the money, the talent, and know how to churn out a great experience from film all the way down to dvd case. I don't expect film studios outside of America to have such a high bar for production (with the exception of Studio Canal).

So when I get this blu ray, I'm very surprised by it's quality.

This blu ray is the same material and has the same bulk as a hardbound book. If you didn't know it was a film, you'd open it up expecting to see pages to read. Someone took their time creating this type of packaging. This blu ray case looks better than the standard blu ray case or DVD. In fact, it looks very much like what the Criterion Collection does. But Criterion is high end, so that's saying. The blu ray transfer of the film looks great. It has a very muted, matte quality about it as many European films do. But make no mistake about it, it's high def; you can see every little freckle on Isebelle's closeups.

As far as what this film is about, it's Isabelle doing what Isabelle does. If you've seen The Piano Teacher, Ma Mere or
Madame Bovary you know the places Isabelle can go. She can inhabit this twisted psyche that was first touched upon back in The Lacemaker, and snowballed from there. It's Isabelle in top form, you don't be disappointed.",1388880000,,1950,4.363636363636363
