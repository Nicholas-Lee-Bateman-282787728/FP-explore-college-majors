28447,3,0767882938,"Educating Rita is a kick, with a wonderful performance from Julie Walters at its heart. Michael Caine, too, is perfectly cast as a poet long since turned to the bottle. Watching those two play off of one another is good  fun; they breathe life into the pat writing. When the story wanders out to  follow either character out in the world, the minor characters are much  less well rounded. (She has a loutish cockney husband and family, he has  intellectual friends who bring wine to parties. Surprised?)
If you  understand the basic outline of the plot here -- cockney young woman trying  to raise herself in charmingly spirited fashion, professor in his cups who  finds the upstart refreshing -- you aren't going to be surprised by where  the story goes. Educating Rita does handle all the likely turns with grace,  though, and that lets you concentrate on appreciating the acting.  The  movie's very watchable and has a good heart.",964051200,,933,4.80503144654088
28448,3,0767882938,"Michael Caine and Julie Walters star in this story of a woman who wants to learn more and change her social status, and the drunken professor who tutors her. That sounds like Pygmalion or My Fair Lady with sexual tension  added, but this film proves a refreshing change, as Rita sets out to  improve both herself and the habits of Frank, her professor. Walters is  wonderful as Rita, reprising her role from the original play, and Caine is  equally good.",963878400,5,454,4.6375
28449,5,0767882938,"One of my all-time favourite films, ""Educating Rita"" is absolutely brilliant rich in truth, feeling, terrific acting and a wonderfully written script which well-draws the two protagonists together.  Julie Walters is excellent as the jaunty yet unfulfilled Liverpudlian  hairdresser who desperately yearns for an educated mind and the somewhat  underrated actor Michael Caine also gives a good performance as her  depressed English tutor who wollows in his own self-pity. In eachother,  they find a new lease of life and stike a special friendship which  eventually benefits the pair of them. And I simply loved the fact that the  writer, Willy Russell, didn't take advantage of the fact that they were  good friends of the opposite sex and make them a couple and the way in  which we see Rita gradually develop and find herself. Terrific stuff.",951782400,24,844,5.147058823529412
28450,5,0767882938,"Miss Walters played the part of a liverpudlian, not a Cockney. Strangely enough, I, too, also bough t Hope and Glory and Shirley Valentine.

28453,3,0767882938,"Released in 1983 and directed by Lewis Gilbert from Willy Russells script, Educating Rita is a drama starring Julie Walters in the titular role as a spirited 26 year-old blue-collar woman from Liverpool, England, who wants to improve her life by enrolling in a special Open University class. She meets with her jaded tutor, Professor Frank (Michael Caine), once a week to study great literature. The morose Frank spends his days in a boozy haze and is intrigued by the outspoken Rita as the mentee lights a fire in the mentor thats been out for a long time.

The plot was taken from George Bernard Shaws Pygmalion (1913), which was the basis for the 1956 Broadway play My Fair Lady, which was in turn made into the famous 1964 movie of the same name. In Roman mythology Pygmalion was a sculptor who fell in love with an ivory statue of a beautiful woman he had carved. Thats fitting for Educating Rita.

I generally enjoyed this drama for several reasons. For instance, I appreciate the locations (Dublin, Ireland, standing in for Liverpool) and the theme: Rita's preconceptions that those in academia lead superior, happier lives are challenged by Frank's failing relationships and pathetic alcoholism, not to mention her cultured flat mate's struggles with severe depression(Maureen Lipman). Despite this, Rita seems to become a stronger person as she learns and adapts to academia.

Unfortunately, the movies lacking in some ways. For one, while Walters is fine in the eponymous role, she was 32 during filming and looked about 35 (her character is supposed to be 26 when introduced). More importantly, the drama just isn't that compelling. I suppose it doesnt help that the character arc of one of the main characters is unsatisfying, even frustrating, but I suppose it could be argued that thats just the way it is sometimes; and it is.

ADDITIONAL CAST: Jeananne Crowley plays Franks live-in non-lover, Professor Julia, while Michael Williams plays the dean of the university and Julias secret lover, Brian. Malcolm Douglas appears as Ritas husband, Denny.

The movie runs 110 minutes and was shot in Dublin, Ireland.

28459,4,0767882938,"This is one of the great films of the second half of the twentieth century. It is, in essence, Pygmalion redux. Unlike GB Shaw's treatment, however, Michael Caine's Eng Lit professor is the sort of dissolute character of whom Henry Higgins would most certainly have disapproved. In the middle of an extended alcohol-soaked mid-life crisis, Dr Bryant is content to drift along on an ocean of self-pity and self-contempt. His original conception of himself as a poet fell apart when he realized he had no real talent. Now he lives out his life as a university lecturer in a parody of middle-class contentment.

Into this life walks Rita. For viewers unfamiliar with England, and particularly of England before the Thatcher revolution permeated downward to undo centuries of rigid class system assumptions and automatic prejudices, it's important to understand that Rita's working-class (blue collar) life would never have come into contact with Bryant's middle-class existence except perhaps to serve him in a corner shop or clean his rooms for a pittance. Rita, however, is that rare thing: a person of above-average intelligence and drive, seeking a way out of the claustrophobic half-life she shares with her uneducated husband. Rita wants to better herself. She wants an education. And when Bryant demurres, she forces herself upon him.

The core of the movie is Rita's acquisition not only of knowledge but of middle-class moeurs counterpointed by Bryant's ever-greater dissolution. Watching Rita wrap herself in the most cliched middle-class affectations, Bryant feels he's been party to helping her rob herself of her authenticity. At the same time it is also clear that as she becomes more accomplished his role in her life is reduced, and he resents this. The result is a scene in which a drunken Bryant scorns Rita for what she's become and she asserts her need to be more than she was.

It may not be immediately apparent to non-British viewers just how dead-end life could feel in the UK prior to the Thatcher years. Britain was a place of strikes, of decay, of dashed hopes and dreary days. It was a place where few could feel optimistic about the future. As Bryant says towards the end of the movie, Britain back then was ""a place that's just finishing."" The power of this movie comes from Rita's determination not to sink without trace, without fighting.

In the end both are redeemed. Bryant hits rock-bottom and is sent off to Australia (""It's a paradise for the likes of me"") and Rita gets her degree despite having received a very object lesson in the thinness of the middle-class veneer she assumed was somehow more substantial than her working-class background. As she tells Bryant, ""I had the choice."" And having gained her degree a world of choices opens up to her.

This is very satisfying movie because it works across all levels. The acting is first-rate, the dialog is both witty but also believable, and the final resolution is optimistic without being trite. All in all, this is a movie to see and enjoy and perhaps see again for its warmth and humanity.",1475452800,2,3081,4.928709055876686

A smart but disillusioned, semi-inebriated, professor who is teaching college grad students is forced to tutor uneducated people the finer arts of the English language. ""A waste of my intellect.""

Enter a brash sexy-cheap, young girl who wants more from life than being saddled with an ordinary husband. He wants nothing more than babies a'coupla of beers and a soft couch positioned so the ""Telly""  can watch him.

Rita is one of those people who are very different than their appearance presents. She gradually begins to impress this professor with his jaded outlook on life.

She has a raging curiousity with the ability to ""think outside the box."" It makes her dangerous to the established way of thinking as the ""prof"" warns her.

Rita knows who she is and where she wants to go. It gives her an honest security that few of us know.

Rita is driven by the desire to see what more there may be to life before settling into the routine of bearing and raising children--much to the consternation of her lout of a husband!  When I think of this film, the first scene that comes to my mind is the one where Rita's mother seems depressed while her friends and family sing a forgettable popular song while sitting at the local pub.

On the one hand, this is definitely light-hearted fare that tries not to take anything too seriously. Yet on the other hand, this is really good! I am not sure if one could call this a masterpiece per se.  But if it isn't a masterpiece it's pretty darned close to one. This is the most fun movie I've seen in a long time.

The Cast

The cast members of this movie deserve special mention because they really are the difference maker.  Michael Caine is very good as the professor, which is not surprising considering his track record.

But Julie Walters as Rita steals every scene.  Her boisterous personality is endearing and amusing. It is a perfect complement to his mostly conventional performance.  It's even more impressive considering her prior experience was mostly in the theatre.  Indeed, that year she was nominated for the BAFTA award for ""Most Outstanding Newcomer To Film.""

I have also seen other films with Julie Walters where she doesn't have *the accent.* Her cockney accent in this film is almost a character in and of itself.  It's very effective in creating a sense of her character as a free-spirited and salt-of-the-earth personality.  And it also makes some of her simple lines very funny.

Incidentally, in 1984 this pair were each nominated for best actor and best actress awards by the Academy.  While neither won the Oscar, they each won the respective Golden Globe and BAFTA awards.  Of course, it would have been quite a coup to win the Oscar in that year, since they were each up against Jack Nicholson and Shirley MacLaine for their incredible performances in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terms-of-Endearment/dp/B000055ZF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terms of Endearment</a>, another great picture.  I am glad I didn't have to cast the vote in that year, considering what a difficult choice it would have been to make.

Even if the entire cast consisted of those two alone, this would be an award worthy performance.  But the additional supporting cast is also good, though they can't stand out from the shadows of those two.

The Story and the Script

Speaking of awards, Willy Russell was also nominated for Best Screenplay, Adaptation.  Once again,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terms-of-Endearment/dp/B000055ZF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terms of Endearment</a>&nbsp;took the Oscar in that category but ""Educating Rita"" was nominated by every significant awards organization.

While I won't comment on the worth of the adaptation versus the original, the script does follow that common formula of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pygmalion/dp/0780023536/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pygmalion</a>, where a woman is taken under the wing of a man in the attempt to ""civilize"" her.  Yet in his role as teacher, Caine's character is quickly bested by Rita.  It appears that he is the one who has much to learn from her.

Most of the beauty in the screenwriting is found in the sharp and witty dialogue shared by this pair.  The writing is indeed intimate and effective.  I often found myself laughing unexpectedly.

While the plot itself must to a degree be described as ""predictable,"" the artful way the story is developed is definitely the hallmark of good writing and direction.

Conclusion

This film is a beautiful and funny statement on life and personal growth.  The dialogue will make you laugh, the performances will leave you in awe and the total result will make you want to watch this one again and again.  I highly recommend this movie for all those who haven't seen it yet.

""Educating Rita"" is in my personal top five movies of all time.  Although labeled a romantic comedy I think that this movie is in a class by itself and defies categorization.  I have a definite academic bent and this Oscar nominated, Lewis Gilbert directed, 1983 film still strikes a deep chord though I've watched it over and over.

Frank(Michael Caine), a divorced and bored-with-life alcoholic professor, just ""happens"" to be assigned as a personal tutor for the lovely vibrant working-class Rita(Julie Walters).

Rita shoots straight from the hip and is so lovely and full of life that she won't take no from Frank and thus starts her subtle metamorphosis from ""uneducated"" to ""educated"".  However, in her process of transition Frank finds that he has created a monster, from his point of view(he refers to Shelley's Frankenstein), as Rita takes on the groomed academic veneer that she so desperately covets and Frank so openly despises.

During Rita's ""education"" a love subtly grows between the two and always lurks just below the surface.  Rita is a ""looker"" and her natural beauty coupled with her delightful frankness sparks a constant longing inside of Frank.

This DVD begs the question...just what is real education?  Is it the simple mouthing of academic platitudes from a learned and cultivated rote or is it lighting the spark of investigation inside of someone so that they may excel in life, and love? For the answer to that you need to buy this DVD or at least rent it somewhere :) and find out for yourself!",1216512000,3,1671,5.347328244274809
28530,5,0767882938,"In Educating Rita, we find a woman, working as a hairdresser, who wants to better herself (played by Julie Walters).  More than anything she wants to learn, not to put herself above family and friends, but from a desire to know, to see what else there is in the world that she can do and be. Unfortunately, everyone in her life finds the evolving Rita not to their liking, especially her husband.

Working and studying and coping with a husband who demands children are not easy for Rita.  Things get particularly tense when the husband finds that she has been taking birth control pills behind his back.  He burns her books (gifts from her tutor, Frank, played by Michael Caine) and her essay and forces her to decide if it's worth the effort after all.  Not wanting to be trapped in a life in which she has never felt that she belongs, she pursues her studies, becoming more alienated in the process.  Only Frank encourages her, in spite of his nearly constant alcoholic haze, and she finds her place among other students and while reading great literature, sometimes with her own quirky interpretations.

Even there, however, she doesn't quite fit in.  Perhaps it's only in her own mind that she is not one with the academic world and those who reside there, but in the end she is happier and still yearning to learn.

This really is a marvelous story and one movie that any adult returning to school to pursue a degree should see.  There are pitfalls and people who will try to discourage someone eager to gain that education.  This movie is highly recommended.",1213056000,3,1565,4.634057971014493
28531,5,0767882938,"This flick, with it's small ensemble caught me by surprise on re-run TV, a few years after its release, and I never forgot it.  I was never a Micheal Caine fan, and was new to Walters.  She won me over instantly, and this is now my favorite movie of all time, really because of her perormance, and of course the story.  Basically, It's Pygmaleon, reborn.  A working class ""My Fair Lady"" so to speak.  Rita, a hairdresser without an education signs on for a course at a university, in an attempt to better her life, against the wishes of her ""women should be pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen"" husband, Denny.  Frank, a burnt out teacher with a penchant for whiskey, in overindulgence is her teacher.  As the movie unfolds, He teaches her literature, she teaches him lessons in life.  Eventually they both grow because of it. Rita in an attempt to change herself superficially, dubs herself Susan.  She is a clean slate. Frank, Jaded and bitter, thinks she is better as the whimsical hairdresser, and balks at teaching her, in fear of her become like the other students he has.  In the end he does, and she does change, but she also changes him.  Her marriage crumbles because of her quest at rebirth, his career crumbles because of his drinking, and both are left with a new road ahead. It could have been so easy for another writer to have had them fall in love, have Frank to make the 100% turnaround (out of drunken-ness), that Rita makes of her life.  But instead we get a more real ending.  She has a new education, but an unsure future.  He has a new future, but he may or may not still be a drunk.  They both have a respect, and a frienship for one-another, and maybe a slight enamoration. In the end we are left with the sense they both will come out on top, but at the same time are not given the answers.  Really a great watch for a rainy in the house night.

28540,5,0767882938,"This is a very enjoyable comedy and Michael Caine has an odd presence here.

What happens when a working class ""babe"" decides to go back to school and make a culture for herself and meets a disillusioned and highly drunk literature professor, meant to tutor her in this endeavor?

This is just the premise of this little comedy.

What else is there? Well, the fact that two worlds, at the opposite to each other start to merge through two completely different people.

Like Tom and Jerry, Tweety and Sylvester, this is truly a Cat and Mouse game.

But who is the cat and who, the mouse?

Even better would be the comparison with Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd.

What's up Doc?

For American audiences it may be a bit difficult to understand, since Julie Walters plays in a rather tight British local accent, but the storyline is so well written, that the action alone flaws smoothly and is very understandable.

Earlier, I said that Michael Caine plays an odd role. What I mean by that, is that until this picture was shot, he had always played ordinary people, such like in ""Alfie"", ""Get Carter"", ""The Italian Job"" etc.

In this one he was making a leap forward, in quality and in skills.

By the way, he plays a wonderful ""sober"" drunk.

The entire story is a close parallel to ""Pygmalion"" by George Bernard Shaw. The only difference is that it was quite updated, and while Professor Henry Higgins, would never truly mingle and socialize with members of the working class (it wouldn't even cross his mind to abase himself in doing so), our modern Henry Higgins does it.

But not enough. While Eliza Dolittle in Pygmalion, ""serves and adores"" the Professor, the modern version is far more pragmatic and while she too admires the Professor, she quickly realizes that he is just a wreck and needs a touch of reality in his life.

The entire picture is a delight, with bitter-sweet moments at times, but very hilarious moments throughout.

The transfer in High Definition restores the picture to its original splendor, which even in theaters was never that brilliant. The sound is nothing special, being in plain two-channel Mono, but the dialogues are clear, and since the lines in such a picture are the most important element, this is fair enough.

If you want to watch a true odd couple in action, then Michael Caine and Julie Walters are the couple you want.

I can truly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.",1176940800,4,2410,4.672985781990521

I think I identified with Rita/Susan way back in 1984 when I saw it,  as I was a newly married working class girl trying to get my education one class at a time.  Rita's journey fascinated me,  and I never get to the end of the movie without tearing up at the transformations of both Rita and Frank.  It's more than 20 years later,  I have my education,  and I now know that most of the reading material I devoured in the first 20 years of my life wasn't literature,  but I've never forgotten the feelings portrayed so beautifully by this movie,  those feelings of being between two worlds-the one I started with and the one I was working toward,  as Rita puts it,  trying to discover myself

  I think this movie also portrays another life lesson,  that you can have all the knowledge of an ""educated""  person,  and still not have that be enough to fill the emptiness in your life,  as Rita's tragic roommate shows us.  Rita's education is in far more than some works of literature,  and that is the best thing about this funny,  sweet,  and heart-rending film.",1171843200,7,1165,4.4170616113744074

The changes are subtle and profound; just notice the differences in the way the characters carry themselves when they walk at the end of the movie compared with the beginning.

Julie Walters turns in the Oscar-nominated performance of a lifetime as an Open University working-class student turning up at Michael Caine's (also Oscar nominated) Oxford rooms for tutoring in literature.

The results are hilarious but - more important - deeply revealing of the pretensions on both sides of the class gap that separates these two stars of this low-budget 1983 production.

Walters, whose 'Rita' imagines herself 'a little out of step' with the University thing, is gorgeous and versatile. Caine plays a latter-day drunk Socrates, who only knows one thing: 'I know that I know absolutely nothing'.

He's wrong of course.  He knows more than that and he discovers some of it via's delightful invasion of his miserable life. But, like Socrates, he is wrong in the very best way and his methodological insight unclutters the poverty that allows him to become rich.

EDUCATING RITA is one hundred eleven minutes of pure joy, a largely unremembered romantic comedy and more that may belong on your list of top ten movies.

Walters shows the evolution of Rita without seeming to act at all, she's so natural and comfortable in the role.  Michael Caine is, well, Michael Caine, playing a role here that could have been written for him.  The other characters are also well cast, even though they have relatively little screen time.  The movie does have something of the feel of a stage play, but the director keeps it from feeling claustrophobic by inserting some beautiful outdoor sequences that fit well with the story and also open things up a bit.  The soundtrack is really the only thing about the film that seems dated;  all of the music is done with s synthesizer, which at the time of the film's release was probably considered quite trendy, but now just sounds sort of cheesy.  However, once you get used to it, you forget about it and it does not interfere with enjoying the film.

The video transfer is simply not up to today's standards, with a washed-out image that I do not recall noticing even when I watched it on HBO years ago. It looks to me as if nothing at all was done to clean the image up before the transfer was made.

Michael Caine plays Professor Frank Bryant, a literature prof and burnt-out drunk, and Julie Walters is the blimey girl who wants an education. Both are wonderful as is the story, with the emphasis being placed on Walters's insistance on choosing for herself. It's a credit to Willy Russell's script that she does not fall in love with Caine at the end (that would have been an easy road to go down): the good professor's life is changed for the better and given purpose again by Walters, but he does not win her in the end. The dialogue is crisp and sharp (though it takes a bit getting used to, especially Walters), and the whole movie is most enjoyable. Well worth a watch.",1136592000,4,729,4.615384615384615

If you are reading this review and want to know the synopsis, basically a young hairdresser wants to become more than she is. She feels that only through education will she have more choices open to her. She works privately with a tutor, Frank(Caine), who is an alcoholic. During the time they spend together, each looks at the other with 'the grass is greener' philosophy. Frank thinks that Rita is perfect the ways she is. Rita wants what Frank has. The trade off for each is what makes the film bitter sweet. You so want Rita to achieve her dream, but at a cost of who she is , is painful. What happens? You will have to watch. My tape broke about 3 years ago, so I am very much looking forward to this film.

If you enjoy British slice of life films, this is a must. IF you love Michael Caine or Julie Walters, this is a must. I recommend this very highly. It is an overlooked cinematic treasure.",1134345600,34,1037,4.206030150753769

Gilbert and Russel would team up again for the wonderful ""Shirley Valentine,"" but their work in this film remains unparalleled. Michael Caine gives one of the most memorable performances in an illustrious career, disappearing into his Frank character, and Julie Walters is magnificent as Rita/Susan. The music by David Hentschel is perfectly appropriate, the cinematography by Frank Watts is inspired, the script is both touching and honest, but the magic of this film is in the interplay between the two main characters. This film captures the journey towards self-awareness embodied in education, as the Rita/Susan character develops from hairdresser to student, intellectual, dilitante, and finally into someone very different than at the start of the film yet still undeniably and uniquely ""Rita."" The greatest gift one person can give another is the love of learning, and thus I feel this is among the greatest love stories ever committed to celluloid. The ending might be ""as inevitable as tragedy,"" in the words of Willy Russel, but the relationship between Frank and Rita made their emotional journey worthwhile, and we are all the richer for their trip.",1053302400,7,1311,5.4950495049504955
28558,5,0767882938,"""Educating Rita"", directed by Lewis Gilbert, is an overlooked gem of a film. Based on a London stage play, ""Educating Rita"" (a copy of which is sold by Amazon.co.uk for those who are interested) is the story of a 27-year old middle class London hairdresser/housewife (Julie Walters, in a convincing, touching performance) who, before having children, would like very much to learn about herself. Much to the annoyance of her husband, she enrolls in an ""open university"" literature course to begin her journey (open university is the British term for college night courses). Assigned as her tutor is Frank (Michael Caine, in his deservedly award-winning role), an older literature professor who suffers from low self esteem and has his own relationship problems.
But no, this movie is not what you would ""typically"" expect that storyline to be like. The feel of the movie is very play like -- fans of Glengarry or Death of a Salesman or movies of such ilk would immediately identify.
Had this film been made in the glam throes of Hollywood, Rita and Frank would have hit the sack within two scenes of meeting each other (and it would have been graphic, of course), then realized they were in love, followed by the inevitable obstacle to their relationship (probably a misunderstanding or rival for affections), finally ending up with them overcoming all. Every character and plot point would have been telegraphed well in advance. ""Educating Rita"" does none of this. There are no graphic sex scenes (or any sex scenes for that matter), no grand pronouncements of love, no cliche cliffhangers or deaths in icy seas. Instead, the story portrays Rita and Frank in a very realistic, human manner. As the story unfolds, we watch as they grow as individuals which causes their friendship to become richer. There are turns to the plot which are unexpected. I will not divulge what the end result is, as it is very unconventional and is sure to bring a lump to the throat of any romantic.
Quite simply, ""Educating Rita"" is a very overlooked excellent character study framed by a wonderful story. One of my all time romantic favorites. Definitely your rental dollar well spent.",1049587200,22,2167,4.923497267759563
28559,5,0767882938,"Educating Rita is truly a joy from start to finish. Willy Russell's fantastic adaptation of his own successful stage play is firmly complimented by the divine suitability of Michael Caine and the golden Julie Walters in the lead roles. Julie Walters plays a sassy, street-smart, working-class heroine who is desperate to better herself though has obstacles thrown in her path as her husband fails to share Walters gutsy enthusiasm in making a better life for herself. Michael Caine turns up in one of his greatest roles yet as the drunken teacher who quickly succumbs to Walters down-to-earth charms. There is great feeling between Caine and Walters and both seemingly play off each other. Walters gets to deliver the funniest lines with her sharp, witty outlook on life though is given ample opportunity to display her true powerful range of acting abilities as does Caine. Both put in concentrated performances and approach their roles perfectly. They are given noble support from some fine British actors/esses such as Michael Williams as Brian who is secretly having a sordid affair with Caines wife and Maureen Lipman as the loveably eccentric Trish who's performance is vastly effective.

28563,1,0767882938,"The film Educating Rita is a comedy but making viewers laugh is not its only purpose. This film also tackles many serious subjects, like for example, alcoholism, the struggle to better oneself, the relationship between teacher and student, social class distinctions and disillusionment with one's life and work. Educating Rita is an adaptation of a stage play written by Willy Russell in 1980 and was directed in 1983 by Lewis Gilbert, who later directed the film Shirley Valentine. The two main characters in this film are played by Michael Caine (Dr. Frank Bryant) and Julie Walters (Rita), who plays here the same character she had played before in a stage production of the play. The supporting actors include Michael Williams (Brian), Maureen Lipman (Trish), Jeananne Crowley (Julia), Malcolm Douglas (Denny), Godfrey Quigley (Rita's father) and Dearbhla Molloy (Elaine). Educating Rita is the story of a twenty-six year old working class woman (Rita) who, before having children, would like very much to learn about herself. In order to do that, she enrols in an Open University literature course. Assigned as her tutor is Bryant, an older literature professor who suffers from low self esteem and self-pity.
You do not need to be very literate or educated to understand this film and grasp its meaning, because it is primarily character-oriented, in what it focuses on the lives and experiences of its two main characters. Therefore, and at first sight, some people might even find it a bit boring, as the basic plot, outlined above, presents nothing out of the ordinary. Some background knowledge of English literature would be helpful though, although not necessary to the understanding of the main storyline. Due to the fact that the character played by Julie Walters decides to study literature, the film contains many references, made by various characters, to English writers and poets such as William Blake. For instance, there is a scene in the film, where Bryant, angry at Rita's attitude, shouts and asks her if she has changed her name to Charlotte, Emily, Anne or Virginia. This happens because Rita's real name is Susan but she had decided to be known as Rita in honour of a writer she admired called Rita Mae Brown. In this scene Rita tells Bryant that she no longer calls herself Rita, and one understands better the new names Bryant suggests if one has some knowledge of literature. The names mentioned are not random names but the first names of very important English writers that Rita had come to know in the course of her studies, which are Charlotte, Emily and Anne Bront and Virginia Woolf.
Educating Rita is set and filmed in Liverpool and much of the action takes place in Bryant's office at the University. Although this film is not very visually interesting or has any notable special effects, because it does not show us any fantastic worlds or out of the ordinary settings, much attention was given to the differentiation between the characters and locations of Rita's and the working class' world and the ones of Bryant's, fellow professors' and ""normal/day"" students' world. The places they move in, the way they speak (different accents) and the clothes they wear show us how different their cultural references, their views, their attitudes and lives are. For example, in one scene we see Bryant entertaining his friends at his house, where they are drinking wine and listening to classical music and Rita's family and friends, on the other hand, are drinking beer and singing popular songs in a pub. Because it serves to characterize these different worlds and conditions in life the scenery used plays an important role in understanding the characters' actions. The sets we see in Educating Rita achieve the aim of showing us the differences between the two main characters' worlds and this is well exemplified in the choice of their houses and their location. While Rita's initial house is a very simple one in a typical working class neighbourhood, Bryant's house is large, well furnished, has a garden and is situated in a middle class neighbourhood.
The filming is good and the flow of the story is not interrupted by technical flaws or bad photography. It is also important to talk about the music score. It works well with the film and a concern about choosing the right music for every moment is noticeable. For example, when we see Bryant for the first time, we hear calm music without a great variation of rhythm. On the other hand, when we see Rita also for the first time, loud and triumphant music emerges, making us pay attention to that character and think about the part she is going to play.
In Educating Rita we get to know Rita, a hairdresser, who decides to enrol at an Open University, to study literature and get an education. The tutor assigned to her is Dr. Frank Bryant, a depressed and often drunk university professor. Her husband, Denny, does not agree with this change in her life, and wishes her to be a simple hairdresser and housewife as she had been until then, and to have children like all the other working class women. Although Denny opposes her decision, she does not give up studying, because she is, and in her own words, ""trying to sing a better song"". Denny's growing opposition makes her one day have to choose between her husband and her education at University. She chooses education and leaves Denny. Because of this she has to find another place to live in and moves to Trish's house, an educated and emancipated woman, who also plays an important role in Rita's education, with her ideas and sophistication. Many changes occur in Rita's life, after starting to attend classes at university and being tutored by Bryant, who helps her to get an education. She develops from an unsophisticated and uneducated woman, who is embarrassed at talking with ""normal/day"" students and professors, to a well educated woman, who is no longer afraid of talking to other students and writes essays like them. Her clothing style and the way she speaks change and she leaves her job as a hairdresser to work as a waitress in a restaurant. Her tutor enjoys her navet and spontaneity, as she is so different from his other students, whose pretence of sophistication has dulled their enthusiasm. As Rita becomes more educated through Bryant's help, the educator also grows through his relationship with her. At one stage Bryant gets worried that the education he is giving her is going to change her entirely and that she will become like one of his other students, losing her spark for life and joy of learning. He likes her the way she is and is afraid of ""spoiling"" the beautiful person she is. He warns her about his fears but Rita does not give up on getting an education. Nothing stops her from doing her final exam, for which we see her prepare during the film. At the end of the film she is a changed woman, but is she a totally different Rita?
The film's script is quite good. It must have been a challenge to write the script for Educating Rita, as the original play it was based upon only featured the two main characters and the screenplay had to introduce in it (and at the right time) the characters that are only mentioned and do not actually play a part in the play. The screenplay tells us an interesting story, the dialogues are very witty and it makes us want to know what is going to happen next, how Rita is going to handle her ""education"" and how Bryant is going to react to Rita's development. Because, as said before, the film focuses mainly on the characters of Rita and Bryant and they occupy most of the film's action, they must perform well or the film will die. To my mind Caine and Walters play their parts very well and give us convincing performances. They also have great chemistry together. The other actors do a good job as well.
I think that this film is in some ways similar to other films that cover the topic of a person wanting to better herself/himself and a tutor/teacher who helps her/him doing that. One of these films is My fair lady, a film based on Pygmalion, a play by George Bernard Shaw, where a Professor (Henry Higgins played by Rex Harrison) teaches Eliza Doolittle (played by Audrey Hepburn), a poor florist, how to speak correctly and behave like an upper class lady. Educating Rita distinguishes itself from My fair lady and others of the genre not only because it is a more modern film, set in our times, but also because, among other things, Rita is the one who decides to get an education and she is never presented as a ""thing"" the tutor is going to mould at his will. What also distinguishes this film from others with a similar subject is its end. It is not the usual ""they live happily ever after"", but it ends with a choice made by Rita. Bryant wants Rita to go with him to Australia. Will she go? In my opinion the film and its plot add a different view of this topic to Cinema and make us think about the influence of education and the goals we set for ourselves in our life.
The director's main purpose in making this film must have been to make us think about our attitudes and how education opens new doors in our lives, how it allows us to have a choice",1016928000,7,9191,4.712865133623368

I was once like Rita...common, confused, complacent in the ordinary ways of my limited existence, but my intelligence and desire to refine it slowly bubbled to the top.  This movie is an inspiration to anyone who loves to learn, and to anyone who loves to live.  And it's a beautiful depiction of the life we all find as we venture away from our common surroundings into a world filled with geniuses, charlatans, drunks, dreamers, and institutionalized philistines.  I also love the way Dr. Bryant is influenced and inspired by his pupil, Rita....he moves past his mid life crisis with help from a person who is attempting to overcome the urge to have an early one.  Rita's vibrant and positive attitude drives Dr. Bryant to explore his bottomless pit of despair and alcoholism deeper than ever before(he cannot handle the fact that life is leaving him behind).

Hot Toasty Rag, November 27, 2017

This modern day take on the famous Pygmalion story, in which a knowledgeable gentleman tries to mold a less fortunate, ignorant girl into his idea of a proper lady, stars Michael Caine and Julie Walters. Its rather a hit-and-miss; youll either love it and find it charming, or wish youd just watched My Fair Lady again instead.

While Michael Caine is always pretty likable, his character is written to be a washed-up alcoholic with little to root for. Julie Walters, for the most part, is more obnoxious than endearing, and her common sense charm added to the one-dimensional characters and script created by Willy Russell. This is not a deep movie; it doesnt inspire conversation after the credits roll. Its something to chuckle at, if you find it funny, during the two hours of escapism. I would have preferred a remake of My Fair Lady, with Michael Caine playing Alfred P. Doolittle, a part I believe must have been written for him.",1511740800,,996,4.784883720930233
