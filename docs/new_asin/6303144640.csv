7840849,3,6303144640,"This item was recv'd in perfect condition.  However, I thought it was the classic tv movie.  The box is very similiar, but it is a sing-along video, not the traditional movie, which I had to purchase through another seller.",1364169600,,223,4.6923076923076925
7840850,5,6303144640,"That this classic video expands on the book isn't bad, it's great because it's Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss), comic songwriter Allan Sherman and Chuck Jones, world's most revered cartoon director, doing the ""riffing."" The characters (like Things #1 & #2, and the fish, Karlos K. Krinklebein, are richer; the storyline tighter; and the songs are a hoot. Most of all, the use of language in the cartoon is yet more dazzling. Get the Seuss cartoons Seuss himself took part in: ""Cat in the Hat,"" ""Green Eggs and Ham/Sneetches/The Zax,"" ""The Grinch..."" and, maybe best of all, ""Horton Hears a Who,"" directed by Chuck Jones, with Hans Conreid doing the voices and delightful, Gilbert and Sullivanesque songs, such as that by the redoubtable Wickersham Brothers. (Other reviewers are right: avoid the more recent ""we pan the page of the book while Billy Crystal/John Cleese et al read along""...they are visually nowhere and hold your child's (and your) attention for about a nanosecond.)",1019347200,15,973,5.049689440993789
7840851,4,6303144640,"Although the video does depart from the book, the story and songs are very entertaining.  My daughter is 2 years old and loves it... in fact I've heard her singing along with some of the songs.  I enjoy it too, and this  is important because I usually have to see it/hear it over and over and  over....",956102400,4,302,4.245614035087719
7840852,2,6303144640,"Diasppointing.  Any Dr. Seuss purist will be surprised at the license taken with the orignal story.  Theodore Giesel had a hand in the songs, which aren't even close to the text or the orignal zanniness of it all.  The only similarity is that the Cat in the Hat makes a mess and he cleans  up. No kite flying by Thing 1 or Thing 2, no balancing of the fish on a  book or boat.  Sorry I was misled by the title and Dr. Seuss name, which  usually means quality stories.  If you like 60's animation and silly songs,  this is for you.",950486400,,530,4.117647058823529
