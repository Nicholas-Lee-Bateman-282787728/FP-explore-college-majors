4855745,5,B005P06A1I,this was a christmas present for my father.  he loves it and is already looking forward to the release of the second set of DVDs.,1294099200,2,129,4.16
4855746,5,B005P06A1I,I was able to pre-order the product and received it as soon as it was available and for the cheapest price around. Very impressed with Amazon's service.,1293926400,2,152,4.666666666666667
4855747,5,B005P06A1I,"My brother got me this for Christmas, and it is fantastic! I am a fairly casual sports fan so I didn't know what my level of interest in all different documentaries would be (I have never watched hockey or rugby, and I am not wild about basketball), but to my amazement, I was absolutely captivated by all 15 segments. My initial impression was that it would be more geared to the avid sports fan using a lot of dry statistics and specialized knowledge of the games (which couldn't be more boring to me), but instead it encompasses everything that makes sports so fascinating. It is about the struggle of communities versus corporations (That Band That Wouldn't Die), goodness versus glamour (King's Ransom, Run Ricky Run), aging legends (Muhammad and Larry), and microwave dynasties (The U). This is a brilliant dvd collection that isn't just about sports, but everything that is wonderful (and terrible for that matter) about sports. It is history, it is culture, it is humanity. It is tears of triumph and tears of defeat, and these are the stories that, in a lot of ways, bring people together and tear people apart. Sports, like art and literature, is a reflection of culture and this collection brilliantly marries the two. This is a must own for any sports fan, history fan, film-maker, or cultural analist. Highly recommended.",1293926400,41,1334,4.855263157894737
4855748,5,B005P06A1I,These videos are a must watch for all sports fans. I can't wait until the next 15 are released in a box set.,1293926400,,108,3.739130434782609
4855749,1,B005P06A1I,It would have received a 5 but Vol. 1 DVD 2 was missing 2 out of three segments. Customer service could not tell me when it might be back in stock. They sent me the information for a return but no information about replacing it. This was my son's main Christmad present. I have also written directly to ESPN about their defective product.,1293408000,7,338,4.380952380952381
4855750,5,B005P06A1I,"I've been waiting for the 30 for 30 set on DVD since they started running the documentaries.  I've only been able to catch bits and pieces of them when aired, but I knew it was only a matter of time before the DVDs hit.

If you have anybody on your holiday gift list that likes sports and is hard to buy for, try this.  Just about everything in the sports world from Gretzky to Reggie Miller to the USFL is touched on, so any general knowledge sports fan, like myself, would be thrilled.

I have not watched all 15 (remember, this is volume 1) of the films, probably 5 or 6 so far, and they are all pretty good.  Some are more interesting than others, but that will come down to personal preference.

The packaging is great.  Inside the slide out box are six slim cases that have the films split across six discs.  I bet they could have got it down to four, but then they couldn't charge as much!  Some people may hate the ""raffle"" ticket type design that is on the packaging and the menus, but I really like it.

My only complaint thus far is that the menus seem slow.  It's possible that it's my PS3, so I will not deduct for it, but just wanted to mention it.

All in all, a great collection for sports fans.",1292371200,94,1211,4.172413793103448

4855842,5,B005P06A1I,"I'm giving this a 5-star review for ""Roll Tide / War Eagle"" alone, which is one of the best SEC Storied (or 30 for 30) films ever. It's a favorite of mine as an SEC football fanatic; though I'm neither a Bama nor Auburn fan. That film should be mandatory viewing for any college football fan or casual observer, especially for those who are outside the SEC! Other great films in this series include: ""The Believer;"" ""The Book of Manning"" which really changed my opinion on the Manning family; ""The Announcement;"" and ""The Play that Changed College Football."" The documentary ""Unguarded"" is one of the most compelling films I've seen about the impact of addiction and is absolutely worth the $5! Don't miss it.",1481500800,,709,4.725806451612903

4855906,5,B005P06A1I,"I grew up in the early 90's watching my beloved Lakers beginning to deteriorate. This was also the time I began listening to rap and hip-hop. And then the Wolverines show up and they were the team to watch. My friends and I entered into the Hoop-it-up basketball tournament in 92 and we were the 7th team to be named with some form of the Fab Five (We were the Fab 5ive). I hated Duke and wanted Michigan to crush them. Watching this documentary and seeing Chris Webber call the timeout was heartbreaking to watch again...not to mention laugh when he wasn't called for travelling. At the same time I was glad for George Lynch to be drafted by the Lakers.

Overall, good documentary. What a blast of nostalgia, especially seeing Juwon do the Cabbage Patch!",1456876800,,755,4.551470588235294

4855909,5,B005P06A1I,"Got this film ""The Book of Manning"" after seeing it a few weeks ago on the NFL Channel. Whether you like Archie, Peyton & Eli or not, you should really see this documentary. It really shows a courageous father, loving his sons and encouraging them to follow their own dreams not his. I had a tremendous amount of respect for the Manning family before watching this film. I am amazed at what an incredible family they have. I'm a huge Peyton fan anyway and this just solidified my views!!!",1455580800,,488,4.49438202247191

This film has a lot of spiritual, faith and Christian undertones which I found very uplifting. This film is very emotional and is highly recommended for all viewers.  Although the film has a football context, this story goes much deeper into the lives of those involved and of life in general.

My favorites are those of sports figures who aren't household names -- the ones who've struggled with injuries or addictions -- and never lived up to the hype. These are the individuals who've had lives of tremendous high and lows but keep going. My favorite portraits include Renee Richards, Marinovich Project, and Unguarded.

He and his GF have reported to me that they really enjoy watching the DVD's and the stories are inspirational and informative. For any sports enthusiast, it is a great gift idea! I have also ordered the second volume for a future gift... It was available as a pre-order this week. I wanted to get it before it sold out like the first volume! As always, ordering from Amazon is a seamless transaction!",1302048000,,540,4.252427184466019
4856298,5,B005P06A1I,"I purchased this item for my husband as a Christmas gift.  It took a while for the product to be sent to me, due to the busy holiday season and the time of the year that I placed my order.  But it's a great gift for the sport enthusiast in your life.",1301875200,,250,3.7884615384615383
4856299,4,B005P06A1I,I purchased this DVD collection as a Valentines day gift for the boyfirend (who has everything so boxers and chocolate would not do). I couldn't have been more pleased. It arrived early and was nicely packaged for gift-giving. The collection is AWESOME! He has enjoyed every DVD so far (he's watched a/b 10 of the 15) and is begging for Volume 2 as his next gift. ESPN has done a wonderful job with this collection. Wonder what they put together next (if it's as good as 30 in 30 we'll be purchasing it too)?!,1300147200,,509,4.425531914893617
4856300,5,B005P06A1I,"I ordered this for my husband for Valentines Day and I have not regretted it yet! He was a little caught off guard by it, as it is not a typical gift he would ask for, but he has really enjoyed watching the films. We have watched 3 or 4 together, and every one that I have watched, I have thoroughly enjoyed too. He has told me many times how glad he is that I got him the set. There are many interesting stories on these DVD's. It was packaged nicely and all the components were there. I can't wait to buy him volume 2!",1299542400,,520,3.961904761904762
4856301,5,B005P06A1I,"Correction: this is a 16:9 format, not a 4:3 as is stated on Amazon. While it is not currently available on Blu-ray format, much of the file footage is pre-HD sourced. Similar for those familiar with the documentary ""Tyson,"" the DVD format is suitable for most. Upscaling via most Blu-ray players and a HDMI cable will please the majority of viewers.

As this is an ESPN production vs. HBO Sports, the language is toned down, yet still tells the story. I enjoy the personal connection that each film maker has with each piece. The depth of candid interviews (some better than others) is on par with Frontline - making me wonder ""how did they get this individual to go on camera?!""

For those considering buying a single release of their ""favorite,"" 30 for 30, I highly recommend paying just a little more to receive almost 24 hours of content!
Many of the stories transcend sports, and dig into the core of American society.",1297728000,10,924,4.662576687116564

4856304,5,B005P06A1I,I purchased this for my boyfriend who caught several of the 30 for 30 documentaries when they aired on ESPN and enjoyed them immensely.  They are all very well produced and  a must-have for any sports enthusiast.  Even those who aren't sports fans will find the stories compelling.,1296172800,,281,4.8125

4856306,5,B005P06A1I,First sought to buy the 30 for 30 for the story on the University of Miami. My husband has this saved on the DVR (for quite some time now). I was very pleased to learn of the additonal stories for this series. My husband was extremely happy with this gift. This was also a bit cheaper than buying in the store. I like that I was able to reserve my copy before it hit the stores. Another great Amazon buy!,1295308800,3,404,4.0625
4856307,5,B005P06A1I,"I bought this collection for my husband for Christmas. He had seen a few on TV and really liked them. I am not a big sports fan but I find these docs to be truely fasinating. I never understood what the ""pony express was"", in fact my husband was watching an SMU game on tv and I said ""Who are they, and when did they get so good."" My ONLY complaint is that it is not ALL 30 films. But the 15 that are there are well done. Sports lover or not... Great Collection!",1294963200,3,462,3.925531914893617

8482255,5,B005P06A1I,"This is based on the true story of Dewey Bozella, an innocent man thrown in jail for a crime he didn't commit. While in jail, he learned to become a boxer, got his high school diploma and his master's degree, and married the love of his life. He spent 26 years in jail, but decided to forgive everyone who put him there and move forward in his new boxing career. For teachers, this is a spectacular program to pair with the book The Other Wes Moore. The kids love watching it and I never get sick of seeing it several times a year each year.",1514851200,,541,4.161904761904762

8482257,5,B005P06A1I,Not really understanding why Amazon has several people's comments under the Detroit Pistons Blu Ray an those people reviews have nothing to do with the documentary smh. Last time I checked there comments shouldn't have been approved if the content is off topic. Anyway The Bad Boys Documentary is on point. I'm a huge Pistons fan an was born n raised in Detroit so I actually remember being at the parade when we won the Championship in 89' an went back 2 back. This documentary covered every aspect of the Bad Boys an Detroit Pistons during that great era. It's the best 30 for 30 film besides The Fab Five. Buy this with great confidence an enjoy!
