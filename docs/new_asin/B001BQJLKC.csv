8284259,5,B001BQJLKC,This dvd should be watched by individual Christians and Christian groups over and over again. Ray has a way of making things simple and he does so in helping us to understand the reasons to evangelize and how to do it. He first explains that a fire for God is necessary and how that in looking at what Jesus has done for us on the cross we can and should be filled with unspeakable joy and gratitude. From that joy comes a zeal and energy to go forth with the gospel. He makes it very clear that those who are top candidates to evangelize are those who are fearful and weak. He finishes by discussing his own personal motivation to evangelize: an overwhelming gratitude to God for saving him and delivering him from death to life and from hell to heaven.,1294012800,2,754,4.3546099290780145
