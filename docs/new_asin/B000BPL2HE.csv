2436440,5,B000BPL2HE,This is a great picture. The location shooting and look of this picture is fantastic. The dvd is an excellent transfer.,1197331200,,119,4.714285714285714
2436441,4,B000BPL2HE,"If you grew up in the early 80s, it was hard to ignore Bo Derek. She was everywhere. On talk shows, posters and magazines - and mostly unclothed. These two films represent her true arrival on the scene. She had made a minor splash as the gal who gets her leg bit off by ""Orca,"" but who can rememeber a pretty woman in the wake of a Killer Whale rampage?  But who can forget Bo bouncing on the beach with her hair in beads? ""10"" was one of those films that you conspired to sneak into at the multiplex. And it was the reason some of us put up with irritating guys so we could get a second shot of seeing it on HBO (or was it Showtime?). Bo was hot and the rest of the movie was there for the old people.

Tarzan, The Ape Man was Bo's attempt to turn her star power into cinematic gold. She wasn't merely going to be an actress, she would produce ""Tarzan, The Ape Man"" along with her husband John directing. And it's not that bad of a Tarzan film - with the great John Phillip Law (Danger Diabolik) and Richard Harris along with Miles O'Keeffe as the Ape Man. And in order to keep people sitting in the theater until the last frame of the film runs through the projector, Bo remains topless for the end credits - don't cut this DVD off early.

The only other DVD that you need to truly lust for Bo's glory days is ""Bolero.""

I wouldn't recommend these films to someone who doesn't have a lust for Bo.  But the price of this double feature is just right for me to put it on my guilty pleasure shelf - and I do have one.",1136332800,26,1516,4.05685618729097

2436449,4,B000BPL2HE,"Tarzan hits the classic 1980's romantic soft porn classic where there was acting, a plot, a theme, scenery, etc.  Some scenes could be cut out and the movie could have been a 100 (like being kidnapped by painters).",1371513600,,214,4.631578947368421
