He has great music, great voice, I'm a fan.
So seeing him on DVD just embarrassed me, way too much shirtless stuff and focused on the girls angle. Just give me normal hetrosexual music video.
The way he was sooooooooo into himself, actually put me off him.
But for the girl fans, go for it. For the guys, don't go there, its not for you.",1195862400,,354,4.144927536231884
