2567912,5,B000FII900,I'm lucky enough to take her class LIVE as well as have the DVD.  She does a great overall workout and makes you feel like every muscle is getting tighter.  You can't go wrong!,1150243200,2,176,4.147058823529412
2567913,5,B000FII900,I watched and worked out with Kira while she was pregnant and she taught this class. I also worked out with two other expectant mothers who worked out with Kira on the Total Body Tone Workout during and after their pregnancy.  They are still working out now that they have had their children and they look great. They have toned up their bodies and lost almost all baby fat in less than 6 months.,1149724800,,396,4.351351351351352
2567914,5,B000FII900,"I bought the Total Body Tone workout video for a workout to fit in my busy mom schedule.  I was very happy with the way the workout was set up.  It was not only easy to follow but it also was challenging,  I have mixed the workouts up to keep from getting bored and have even added my own moves to make it easier or harder.  Since I have had this video I not only feel better and have a little more energy but I have dropped a dress size.  I'm so happy to see such a change in just a couple of weeks and in my opinion it was money well spent.  I definitely will invest in more of the videos like this.  Thanks for the help!!!",1149033600,5,625,3.8359375
2567915,5,B000FII900,"In researching pregnancy fitness dvds, I read in the notes of Kira's Cardio & Core Pregnancy Fitness that advanced exercisers would like this dvd (I guess the name was changed from Cardio Tone to Total Body Tone, a search of her name led me to this one). I am active and pregnant and enjoy weight training. This workout is exactly what I wanted! I particularly enjoy the circuit training format, it works some cardio at the same time.

There is a pregnant girl showing the pre-natal options. I can see that this will also be awesome for getting me back in shape after the baby comes! I hope it helps me get abs and legs like Kira's, wow! Quite motivating!

I'll write how it is for post-natal weight loss after the baby arrives!",1148515200,3,728,4.466165413533835
2567916,5,B000FII900,"This dvd was recommended to me by a friend who takes exercise classes from Kira Langolf and had done this workout in her gym. This workout is challenging, yet fun. I like the different options given! There is a bonus 10-minute workout that is fabulous! Even if I don't feel like exercising I can talk myself into a 10-minute workout!

Since using the program, I have lost weight and inches!

I found Kira to be quite thorough in her explanations and reminders in the workout.

I would highly recommend this workout to anyone who wants to lose weight and inches!",1148515200,3,561,4.59
8123111,4,B000FII900,"If you want to work your muscles well in a brief period of time, this is it! VEry good.",1227139200,,87,3.6315789473684212
8123112,5,B000FII900,"This is my favorite prenatal workout.  I have 3 others but this is the one I really look forward to.  I like the unique combinations and how it keeps your heart rate up throughout.  When I'm done I feel like I've really worked out without overdoing it. This is a workout for everyone--pregnant or not, the mods are great.  I'm using 3 lb weights to do this in pregnancy and I've been following Rochelle.  If you aren't pregnant, follow Kira or the girl using the step.  Kira keeps things moderate and the one on the step shows you how to really ""step up"" your workout when you are more advanced. I like how this incorporates weights with a little cardio and balance too. If you are pregnant, skip the ab section--we shouldn't be lying flat on the floor!  I use that time to make my own stepper into an incline bench and do some chest presses and then complete the stretching section.  Yes, the production is kind of lame and there is no music. When you get used to the workout, put your i-pod on and listen to your own.  I've always gotten sick of workout DVD music so this is a nice change.  Thanks for an interesting workout that I won't need to put away after baby comes.  I'll be able to use this for years to come!",1216684800,,1219,4.279475982532751
8123113,5,B000FII900,"I have been lucky enough to have Kira as my personal trainer for the past three years.  If I am unable to go to the gym, I just pop in the video.  I feel as if I am getting an excellent workout.  I take them with me when I visit my sisters.  They enjoy it as much as I do.  Great!  If I am pressed for time, who isn't these days, the 10 minute workout is super.  By the way, I'm 63 years old.",1191110400,,392,3.5952380952380953
8123114,2,B000FII900,This may be a workout but I can't get past how poor the quality of the DVD is.  It seems like she took her home video camera and made a workout video with it.  Definitely not worth the money.  Try Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Workout...it's my favorite!,1185235200,2,248,4.3478260869565215
8123115,1,B000FII900,The exercises are nothing special.  The background is depressing - a grayish cloth with a few fake flowers at the corners.  Just can't take this while spending my precious time exercising and this is not cheap at $19.  I will stick with the quality known names.  This was returned the same day.,1173484800,2,294,4.596153846153846
8123116,4,B000FII900,"I am a personal trainer so I am a fairly advanced exerciser.  I thought the instructor was clear and did a good job on the cuing.  She was not annoying.  I was a little disappointed with the routine itself.  I thought it would be a little more challenging and creative.  Probably challenging for a beginner or an intermediate person but not for an advanced person.  It does cover the total body but if you have been exercising for a while, none of the exercises will be something new to you.",1173312000,,491,4.4
8123117,3,B000FII900,"This workout does give you a great workout in a relatively short amount of time, but I find the poor quality of the filming to be distracting.  I wish it had music--I get kind of bored while I'm doing it.  I've found that the modifications for pregnancy, regular, and intense are not very different from each other.  I was used to doing Cindy Crawford workout tapes before I got pregnant and needed a more ""intense"" pregnancy workout than most.  I may just be spoiled on the high-budget workout tapes from what I was doing before.  It is a good workout, but a bit cheesy.",1163030400,,571,4.451923076923077
8123118,5,B000FII900,"I looooved this video.  Kira is easy to follow and makes the workout as simple as possible while still providing a great workout.  I would recommend this video to anyone who is interested in getting in shape, weather it be losing weight or just toning up.",1153785600,,255,4.521739130434782
8123119,5,B000FII900,Getting in shape means losing weight and toning up. Cardio alone will not do the trick. Kira has given me the tools with this video. I get all over toning and shape with Total Body Tone. I love the definition in my arms and abs. There are levels for beginner to advanced so anyone can have success with this video.,1152921600,2,314,4.25
8123120,5,B000FII900,"Okay, so I am actually IN the video and am about 7 months pregnant too! I continued doing this very workout until about my 38th week.  I have to say that by keeping my workout schedule before, during and after my pregnancy allowed me to get back into my pre-pregnancy shape (size 4!) at only 5 months!  Kira's unique workouts can be tailored by anyone to achieve a personal level of fitness.  I have been working out with Kira for the past 4 years, and am in the best shape of my life at age 36!  It really works.",1152057600,6,513,4.151515151515151
