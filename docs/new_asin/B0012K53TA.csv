8246420,2,B0012K53TA,"There would have been 5 stars, but I deducted two for 2 broken cases and one for a wrong disc. I was looking forward to seeing the last of the episodes but the disc in case marked 7 was the disc 6 instead. I can replace the broken cases, but since I can't buy just a duplicate of the wrong disc I can't comment on the entire series and it isn't worth it to repurchase the entire set for just one disc.  I usually check out the discs when they first arrive but I didn't this time. A good lesson to learn when I order next time.
One negative about the discs is that the menu doesn't return to the episode list after each episode is over...it continues on to the next one which is not a user-friendly feature.",1467936000,,706,4.079136690647482
