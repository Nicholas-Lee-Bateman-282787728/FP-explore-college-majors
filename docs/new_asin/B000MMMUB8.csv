8170105,5,B000MMMUB8,"Since I saw Beatles Anthology, I've never seen another video of the Fab Four. Two CD's (1 and 2)are really an excellent documental tape, plenty of music, photography and history.
I recommend buying this product. You will enjoy it a lot

8170106,3,B000MMMUB8,"I was so excited to view part one of this video. Covering the period up to 1965, it took a close look of the song structures and playing styles that made the Beatles unique and revolutionary. I was in heaven.

Then I played the second part, and all the musical commentary was gone. It was far too much significant material to cover in one hour, and every masterpiece album was glossed over. They spent more time on ""Magical Mystery Tour"" than ""Revolver"", the White Album or ""Abbey Road"".
The second part is useless to anyone who's a big Beatles fan and knows the history.",1221350400,11,571,4.490384615384615
