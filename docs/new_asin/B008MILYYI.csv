5169964,4,B008MILYYI,"""Superman"" has best audio (noticibly better than DVD release) but picture is only modestly brighter and no more detailed than DVD. ""Donner Cut"" Superman II is why you get this collection. Picture is wonderfully detailed and naturally colored. You don't notice until played back-to-back that the audio on Doner Cut is a bit muddier than disc 1 (Superman), but still very good over all. ""Returns"" disc isn't much different in quality from standard DVD (mostly because the DVD is so well mastered) and the audio is expectedly clean and balanced since it was recorded using contemporary equipment. So glad to get the 3 together at such a good price. This is the best you'll get for the 3 and it all comes wrapped in one box.",1358208000,,720,4.722222222222222

5169967,5,B008MILYYI,"Warner Brothers usually starts a film immediately after the BD loads.  This may have confused other reviewers.  At each BD's main menu you will find listed all of the bonus found on the individual movie releases.  At least this is true for my December 2012 Amazon purchase.  I did notice my player prohibited going to the main menu until the movie started.  Also, a Pop-up menu exists and has a link to special features.  My individual release of one of the films behaves the same way so these discs are equivalent to the individual releases.

Main video bonus (numbers are minutes:seconds):
Superman the Movie: Donner/Mankiewicz Commentary
 Taking Flight(30:14); Making Superman(30:41); Additional Footage(9:21)
Superman II Donner Cut: Donner/Mankiewicz  Commentary
 Intro(1:54); Doc(13:20); Deleted scenes(8:44)
Superman Returns:  Main Doc(173:42); Resurrecting Jor-El (4:00); Deleted Scenes(15:54)

I verified that ""Superman Returns"" has Dolby TrueHD English 5.1 sound and so it is the Sept. 2008 release.  The other 2 films look to be the Nov. 2006 releases.  The package comes with a slip cover.

None of these blu-ray films get high marks for high-def detail but there is a definite improvement in clarity over the DVD when viewed at an immersive distance (viewing distance 2.5 times image height).

Superman The Movie - Is the extended cut remastered.  The video quality is only slightly better than on DVD.

Superman II The Richard Donner Cut - Let's face it, this is the reason you want to buy this.  And it is terrific.  The video quality is superior and music is crisp.  This is why its better to buy this three disc set rather than its stand-alone version.

5169971,4,B008MILYYI,"As one who is an avid superhero fan, though doesn't consider Superman to be my fav (that honor goes to the best superhero, Batman), I was happy to see a fairly inexpensive bluray set of these three films.

Having feared (from previous blurays) that the quality of transfer for the first two Superman films would be no better than the DVD, I was pleased to see that they do seem to be a high quality transfer and looked pretty good.  The sound, two was pretty good.

My only criticism was that I was hoping for some special features, but given the price, it is definitely a lot better than the more expensive Superman Anthology...hopefully Superman III and IV will be out on blu-ray separately at some point so I can completely my set...for now, the two best Christopher Reeve Supermans and the new one will have to do!",1353196800,14,818,4.513513513513513

If you're like most of everyone else, you probably either disliked or hated the third and forth Superman movies, well now you can get a complete Superman collection without worrying about those, Superman Returns pretty much pretended those movies never happened anyways. Not only does this collection only include all of the good Superman movies, it went even further and included the extended edition of the first film, and the Directors Cut of the second, which was much better than the original cut in my opinion. This set is so much more valuble than what it costs, if only we could have continued on the Superman saga from this instead of that crappy reboot, but oh well, hopefully the crossover with Batman will make up for it, but anyways, get this collection now if you love Superman",1456704000,,802,4.818840579710145

I loved this Superman as a kid, but I hadn't seen it in 20 or 30 years, and wondered if it would hold up to the contemporary eye. I was pleased to see it does - it was a darned well made, well acted film. And it looks better on bluray than it did in the theater when it was brand new, it's a simply gorgeous transfer. This one movie is worth the whole set in my opinion.

5170005,5,B008MILYYI,"The Triple Superman Feature consists of the following films:

1. Superman: The Movie is the best movie about the caped crusader hero. It combines drama,humor,tension and suspense in one complete package. Aside from that,the casting was perfect from Marlon Brando as Jor-El,Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor,Margot Kidder as Lois Lane and of course,Christopher Reeve ,who turned out an iconic performance as the both the bumbling Clark Kent and the hero,Superman. Aside from the adventures of the superhero,it also gives us an idea of his character,humanity and his vulnerability. In summary,this movie is a timeless delight.

2. Superman II:The Richard Donner Cut would have been an epic if it was completed. After viewing this film,it was definitely a lot better and more dramatic than that was released theatrically back in 1980. Lois Lane was more clever in catching that Clark Kent is Superman. Marlon Brando's presence elevated the film into new heights. Aside from that,there was less comical scenes which turned the original Superman II some sort of a slapstick comedy. Also,the existence of the Supervillains were fully explained as well. With regards to the actors involved,we can see that they are more energized with Donner than with Lester especially those who did re- shoots like Reeve,Kidder and Stamp. Finally,the plot was less predictable and clich&eacute;d as compared to Lester's theatrical version. Overall,it would have been the better movie had it been completed that would probably hold a candle to the first Superman movie and I give this one a perfect rating inspite of its not being finished as well.

3. Superman Returns reintroduces the viewer to the superhero. The film does great job in doing that. At the same time,we get to go back Superman:The Movie and Superman II,two great films,from which the story updates us from and neglect the other two films - Supermans III and IV - two poorly made films. The use of special effects were wonderful as well. It makes us appreciate the powers of Superman as they look very realistic as possible. The story was not as good as the first two Superman but nevertheless it wasn't as bad as the last two sequels so it was still worth the view.

This is definitely a delight for any Superman fan to own as it consists of arguably three of the best Superman films ever released on screen.",1414108800,,2346,4.9770408163265305

5170011,3,B008MILYYI,"After holding off for so long I decided to get what appeared to be a bargain of 3 films for the price of one recalling it had been a long time since I had seen the original thearetical versions of all the films.  I was most intrigued with the Donner version of the second film and so I decided to take the chance.  In hindsight I now have mixed feelings about this collection for a number of reasons.  As a film buff I do miss the older days of film when good acting and especially good directing meant something and so it's no surprise for me to state that my favourite films tend to be because of the directors and not the so-called stars.

I count films by Kurosawa, Lean, Hitchcock and especially Kubrick as among my favourites because just by the way they frame shots they can tell a story with very few if necessary words.  As I saw the first Superman film as a kid, I didn't really appreciate what Donner did as a director to the film until now decades later I have to say that some of the shots he chooses especially of the Smallville scenes are breathtakingly beautiful.  Some have mistakenly taken the dreamy looking less defined scenes as bad blu ray HD transferring but this is because younger film goers have not been exposed to the golden age of film when directors intentionally do this to scenes to tell the story which in this case is the dreamy, nostalgic feel of Superman's youth.

For this reason, I feel the video transfer for this film is very good and is as intended by the director while I do feel the sound quality could have been improved with at least a DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround option made available and yet for me this the first film is the real gem of this release.  Story-wise I always regretted what I thought was the ending that spoiled what otherwise was a great film with bad science and how time travel is so easily effected by anyone let alone Superman.  Surely the scriptwriters or even Donner could have come up with a better ending than that!  It bothered me as a kid and it bothers me now just as the ludicrous J J Abrams' Star Trek films terribly bad science continues to do so for me today.

The Donner cut for the second film greatly disappointed me too until I realised that it was not a Directors' cut per se as in the original director revisiting and re-editing the previous film which was mostly lost but more of a fan putting together as best as possible what was available which regretfully really shows.  I'm sure if Donner could re-shoot he certainly would; there were some scenes like the last one in the diner that just doesn't make any sense outside the Lester version and really shouldn't have been included.  Also going back again to the bad science of the first film's ending well once too often made me wish I had the Lester version back again which I also agree with another reviewer should have been included in this set as well.

The third film is what is wrong about film today from the point of view of film buffs who are used to film being art but for those who are not would feel is the best of the bunch.  We get great video and audio, great cgi and special effects, lots of noise and action but relatively poor acting and almost as bad plot lines and directors who don't need any kind of artistic skill with less talent than Hitchcock's little finger.  It's really sad to see what movies have descended into these days but I can understand how people who have never tasted fine wine would think Ripple is the best wine ever made.

There are those that don't even give a film a chance just because it's old or in black and white and so presume it must be bad which is just a tragic prejudice that makes them miss out on so much; I know because I used to be like that until I decided to change my attitude and I am so grateful to be exposed to some of the greatest films that continue to move me so much so that I find myself wanting to return to watch the same film many times over discovering even more with each viewing.  How many films can you say that about today?  I know that I wouldn't want to watch Singer's film more than twice but I wouldn't mind however watching Donner's first film again and again despite the ending which I hate because it comes closest to film art in this package and does reward repeated viewing despite the relatively weak special effects when compared with today's computer generated ones.

Overall I find this still a worthwhile package for the price which is fully redeemed by the first film but the second and third films I can give a miss although fans of all these films can be satisfied with overall good video and sound quality especially for the third film despite the poor acting and scriptwriting.

Mixed bag but redeemed somewhat by the first film.",1386201600,6,4758,4.3718820861678

5170020,5,B008MILYYI,"Others have commented on the fine quality of the blu-ray transfers of these three films, so I'll confine myself to a few remarks about the movies themselves and two editing suggestions.

I think all three films are quite fine, especially the first and ""Returns"".  Christopher Reeve is a wonderful Superman / Clark Kent and Brandon Routh is excellent in a performance that is consistent with Reeve's take on the Man of Steel.  These are the best three Superman movies, and for my money, ""Superman Returns"" is far better than the critics generally concede.  Kevin Spacey's Lex Luthor is mustache-twirlingly wicked and his evil plot is worthy of the megalomaniac villain.  The story is a largely-logical and enjoyable continuation from ""Superman II"".  As for the latter, Richard Donner's version is preferable to Richard Lester's (though not in every way).  Lester went a bit overboard with the silly humor in his version and gives Superman and the Phantom Zone villains some weird extra powers, but has some fine scenes of his own.

If you can purchase this blu-ray trilogy for under $20, as I did, then you'll be getting a great bargain on three very enjoyable movies.  If you can get an inexpensive version of Superman II on DVD, as well, then you can make your own edit of the film that includes the best of both Donner's and Lester's visions.

MAKING A BETTER (in my opinion) SUPERMAN and SUPERMAN II movie experience:

I really hate the spinning the world backwards and reversing time business in both ""Superman the Movie"" and ""Superman II The Richard Donner Cut"".  To eliminate it, while still having solid (and more logical) stories, I suggest the following.

SUPERMAN, THE MOVIE EDIT:
At Chapter 39 (circa 2:10:45) of the blu-ray, after Superman saves the train, but before the dam cracks, skip to Chapter 43 (2:22:30) and the prison warden at his desk.

SUPERMAN II EDIT (works best with a separate DVD and Blu-Ray player connected to your entertainment system):

1) Lester DVD: Start with Chapters 3, 4, and 5 (circa 8:30-22:30) - at the Daily Planet through the end of the orange juice scene.  Then skip to Chapter 34 and stop the player (with resume play engaged).

2) Donner Blu-Ray: Start at Chapter 4 and watch through Chapter 28 (12:00-1:41:00).  Stop after Lex Luthor says, ""We're in the North Pole, right?""

3) Lester DVD: Finish with Chapters 34 to the end (1:55:30-2:07:30)",1366070400,,2391,4.873762376237623

After reading many negative reviews from even hard-core fans about the last 3 Superman movies (Superman III, Superman IV and Superman V), I decided to buy this item. I vividly remembered the details about the first two Superman movies as I watched them in my early teens and remembered enjoying them very much so I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed. And the price difference between this triple feature and the aforementioned box sets also played an important factor in my decision.

Amazon has incorrect information in the product details about this product. Actually, this product does contain lots of bonus features, feature commentaries for all three movies available in addition to making of featurettes, behind-the-story featurettes, etc. I am not sure why Amazon product page says No special features.

I had not seen Superman Returns (which I had thought to be a cheap Hollywood remake) and I saw it for the first time. My first impression wasn't great as it seemed my initial concerns were confirmed about it being a cheap remake (too much similarities to the original Superman) but as I watched it a few times, I grew to like it. It's not great but it's ok. I think the first two Superman movies makes this product a great buy (especially, the famous Richard Donner cut, the version of the Superman II as it was intended to be seen).",1361750400,10,1929,6.029197080291971

5170037,3,B008MILYYI,"I am not a big fan of movie packs, but this one is cheap and I had to have 'Superman Returns' and the 'Richard Donner Cut' on Blu Ray so why not get a 3-for-1 deal?  In that regard I am happy.

'Superman: The Movie' is one the greatest movies of all time.  It is in my top 100.  Without any serious tinkering on it, there is no way I would down vote this movie.  It gets a five stars from me.  Except it's bundled with the other two so, bonus.

'Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut' takes a movie that even as a kid I was only mildly thrilled about, and made it better.  Mostly.  What this version does right:  We now know HOW Superman gets his powers back.  That <Insert string of expletives> issue was one of the worst parts of the Richard Lester version, that they never covered.  That and the memory wiping kiss, that is gone too, but the solution here was just as bad.  The test footage that was used for the Niagra Falls bit, where Lois finally gets Clark to reveal he is Superman is better.  I wish it could have been filmed, but the Richard Lester version is more, believable.  In that version, I think Superman just gave up...which made for a more interesting exchange.
The parts that were not so good:  Superman, with no prodding from Lois decides to give up his powers.  And Jor El goes along with it.  This makes no sense.  In the RL version, his mother tells him he has to be human if he wants some human-human love, the explanation although dumb, is at least an explanation.  We already know the two of them can totally get it on from the last shots of them.  No Mallrats shotgun like reproduction moment that ends in Lois death.

 ""The Kiss"" is gone, but what they do instead really blows too.  Why does Lois Lane have to forget?  I know, Dick Donner did not get to finish his version originally and twenty some odd years later re-filming was not going to happen, and they were could only use footage that came before.  So, they're forgiven there.  But had this been the version that went to screens, it would have still been kind of a letdown.

Superman Returns though I was happy to see a new Superman movie that rehashes the first one, granted in a very creative way.  It was mostly a rehash with some Emo-Stalker Superman action thrown in.  Kevin Spacey is fantastic and Brandon Rouths Superman/Clark Kent made a great continuation of the Christopher Reeves version, which did not need to be done, but its not such a bad thing here.  I would have loved to have seen a more original sequel.  I think Brandon Routh would have done great.  But, then again this movie suffers from Emo-Stalker Superman.  But, aside from that it made a decent bookend to the first two movies.",1361318400,,2689,4.365656565656566
5170038,5,B008MILYYI,"A great value package. Superman the movie is the extended cut, Richard Donner's cut of Superman 2 is excellent and in my opinion a better movie than the released version, Superman Returns deserves to be in the triple pack and the extras are great on this disc, there is an excellent making off selection that spans hours of footage of the production process and really goes in depth on the process. All in all a great value way to have all three movies in their definitive cuts. These discs play on a UK Blu Ray Player.",1361059200,5,519,4.416666666666667

5170045,4,B008MILYYI,"The copies of the movies are excellent and look great.  However the version of Superman II is the Richard Donner cut.  If you haven't seen it, be aware that this version is very, very different from the original theatrical cut.  There are not only lots of extra scenes, there are also a lot of scenes cut out.  Plus some of the extra scenes are from stills, and look really bad.

My single biggest complaint about this collection, is that the Superman II BD does not include the original theatrical version.  If you prefer the Richard Donner cut, then that shouldn't be a problem, but for myself I'd prefer to have both versions.",1359849600,2,629,4.571428571428571

If you just want the absolute best Superman movies, namely Superman: The Movie, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, and Superman Returns, this is the Blu-ray combo pack you want to buy! The picture and audio quality is as great as can be. This triple feature includes the best versions of the best Superman films.

I must note that there is a box-set on Amazon as well that has every version of Superman's movies in one collection with 8 discs. If you want all the versions of the Superman films buy that one instead of this 3 film set, but just check you are ordering the 8 set and not the more common incomplete 5 disc set. That one includes Superman's theatrical and extended versions, the garbage theatrical Superman II, the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II, the awful Superman III and Superman IV, as well as Superman Returns. But no one really likes Superman II's goofy theatrical version, Superman III, or Superman IV, so I feel like you can easily skip those ones.

This triple pack includes Superman: The Movie in its theatrical version without the extended filler, if you want the longer one of Superman I, you can get the extended Blu-ray by itself.

Superman II is the better Richard Donner Cut done by the first movie's excellent director. If you want Superman II in its original worse theatrical version then there are options on Amazon with that one instead. This version is the far superior and more serious version without the dated campy elements of the theatrical release.

This also has Superman Returns which pales in comparison to the original 2 Superman films with Christopher Reeve, but it is pretty fun and a neat modern take on Superman. Superman Returns is still better than Superman III or Superman IV. It's also truer to character than Superman in Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman, or Justice League. I think it is worth a watch at least.

In short, this triple pack features the 3 very best Superman films in their most enjoyable versions. If these are all you want, get this Blu-ray! If you really want the other versions, there is a box-set on Amazon, just make sure it's the 8 disc, not the 5 disc version.",1525219200,,2485,5.02676399026764
