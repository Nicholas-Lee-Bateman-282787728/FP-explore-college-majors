8579181,5,B00CAEHTKI,"This is a fun workout, BUT not for beginners!  You need to have learned jump rope with a more basic DVD (like the RopeSport Basic DVD) before attempting this one.  Although Yenny does show each move individually, the workout is not easy and more of an intermediate level.  It is non-stop and challenging!",1413763200,2,304,4.69811320754717
8579182,4,B00CAEHTKI,the dvd was damaged and didn't work. tried it on every dvd player I have. froze.  the bright side I  did get my refund pretty quick. I will say that a friend of mine ordered this product and she was really impressed with it.  That was initially the reason I ordered it.  Unfortunately it didn't work for me but I do believe it to be a good product.,1375401600,,348,4.073529411764706
8579183,5,B00CAEHTKI,"Well, Yenny's voice is so cute, it might be worth the price of the video just to hear her speak. But what of the workout? I had half a thought to jump rope to get into some semblance of shape. The positive reviews of this DVD persuaded me to buy it. After watching Yenny and her three accomplices perform the warmup routine (sans ropes), I realized I was way out of my league (mind you, that was just the warmup!). Including Yenny there are four jumpers. It looks like there could be editing breaks between each subroutine, but even so, the girls just don't miss a jump. I can't go but 30 revolutions without faulting. If you are young, energetic, coordinated, and bouncy then this could be the workout for you. As for myself, I'm thinking the new Twinkie stacking workout could be the answer. In addition to the rope skipping routine, this video includes a food prep section and testimonials. I am keeping this video for inspiration; and if I ever feel the exercise mood strike me, then it is just a hop, skip, and jump away!",1375056000,,1026,4.462765957446808
8579184,5,B00CAEHTKI,"I was looking for an at home/gym/office workout to increase my cardio endurance, stamina, coordination, and help me lose weight while also toning up...I have to say that Yenny's jump rope workout DVD met my needs and much more. The DVD has a nutrition guide as well, and a how to section to help you learn the moves! Yenny seems fun and sweet. Only thing is that you have to have at least some basic jump rope skills. I highly reccommend  this fun and challenging jump rope workout DVD.

8579185,5,B00CAEHTKI,"Yenny pOLANCO has been a friend and chiropractic patient of mine for five or six years.  She is motivated, disciplined, and highly accomplished -- among other things, a professional fitness athlete at the highest level; former track standout, and amateur boxing champion.

I trained with Yenny for several years -- jumping rope, heavy and speed bag training, etc.  She works-out hard in the gym, and there's no question that she helped me get into the best shape of my life.

Yenny scores a 7-round knockout with this DVD!  She carefully designed the workout to help anyone who's serious about burning fat and becoming more fit.  From the gradual warm-up exercises to the 7-round, heart pumping, cardiovascular jump rope routine, Yenny and the girls nail it.

You need not be an elite athlete to dive into this workout... just someone with a passion for getting on the road to becoming the best you can be.  If that idea resonates with you, I promise that you'll be hard pressed to find a reason to eject ""JUMP THE WEIGHT OFF"" from your Blu-Ray player :)

Kudos to Yenny on a tough job, well done...

8579186,5,B00CAEHTKI,"I wanted to try a jump roping workout having heard from friends that it can be a lot of fun. I searched a little on Google to find out more about Yenny Polanco and found lots of material, she is quite impressive. So I decided to give her DVD a try.

From the very beginning the workout starts to get your blood pumping, I was sweating pretty quick. The warm rounds could be a workout alone. I'm still working on getting all the moves right, their not hard to master, just will take some getting used to since I haven't jump-roped in a LONG time.

I haven't had the workout long, but I can safely say that I think i will enjoy working through it and seeing the results. I will be posting updates as I keep working on.

The nutritional guide shows a few simple meals and good instructions too.

So far I can highly recommend this DVD.",1366761600,2,832,4.213836477987422
