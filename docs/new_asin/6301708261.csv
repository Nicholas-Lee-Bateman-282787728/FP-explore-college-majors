349891,2,6301708261,"I did not enjoy this movie very much - the plot did not hold my attention, and, though it did have a few instances of good humor humor, most of  it was not funny or just plain course (i.e. young boy making a comment about sex). For anyone who may wish to view it for the winter scenes, there are few, and skiing, I only remember one scene, and that was of the father (who could not ski) flying out of control down the hill. In summary, It is about a man who is bored of his office life, so, when his lawyer informs him that he is heir to a modest hotel estate up north, he jumps at the chance to change his occupation to that of hotel proprietor. When he arrives, he finds the place in shambles and, having no job or money, decides to seek a loan so that he can transform the place into a ski resort. The man from whom he gets the loan is hopeful that he will not succeed, as he has an interest in the timber on the property.",1484697600,,925,3.946524064171123

350153,3,6301708261,"I spent five years teaching English at a 640-student secondary school (boarding) in Zambia, and for Saturday night entertainment we would show movies on the outside wall of the dining hall. Our choice one night was ""Snowball Express."" The headmaster was able to borrow it through the USA embassy. I don't think any of them had seen snow, and it was hilarious for them to watch the antics in this movie.

350210,4,6301708261,"I love this movie!  Like many of the other reviews of this movie, it's straight from my childhood.  I remember as a child watching this countless times with my brother.  Here's what I love about the movie:

1.  The cast:  it's first class.  Dean Jones, Nancy Olson, Harry Morgan, etc... The cast not only were good individually, but formed a great ensemble cast that I loved.

2.  The setting:  Colorado in the winter is gorgeous and the director did a great job capturing  the beauty.

3.  The Story:  Ok, you have to go into this film realizing that it isn't Gone with the Wind.  It's a simple story.  There's no evil villain, there's no life and death harrowing plotline.  It's a simple story that is told rather well.  It's simple family entertainment.  Something Disney is a master at.

The Downside:  There are real no downsides to this movie if you go into it with the right expectations, but there are a few elements that seem to point to a bigger issue with Disney.

Many film critics and historians consider the 70s and part of the 80s a dark time for Disney.  They were experimenting with some more adult themes and some might argue they just lost their vision.  Snowball has a few symptoms of that.  For example, there is a little more use of and promotion of alcohol than I expected. It's not a big deal, but you don't see this in earlier Disney movies.

Overall a great movie",1453852800,5,1389,4.477911646586345

The formatting was fine and the sound was perfect. The only issue I had was with the actual DVD itself. Initially I couldn't get the DVD to play, it just wasn't being recognized by my player. I took out the DVD and noticed in the center there was a small bump. It wasn't able to spin. I took a lighter that we use for candles and very slightly warmed the very center to where I could flatten the bump. Worked fine.

I had only seen the movie once during a special School Assembly and I immediately fell in love with the story and the scenery of beautiful Colorado. It's a fun family comedy about a man who decides to chuck the high pressured rat race of the big city...haven't we all been there...for the life of a Colorado Ski Resort Owner after inheriting what he believes will be a gold mine hotel in the Colorado Rockies.
Upon Arriving at his inherited hotel, he finds it in terribly dilapidated condition and in desperate need of renovations...or demolition. The rest of the movie deals with his efforts to restore the hotel with the help of family and friends and after one disaster following another threatens to end both his dream and his family...a possible solution presents itself. Winning the local snow machine race that has been won every year by the local Banker who wants to take his hotel.",1441584000,,1079,4.74468085106383

350395,5,6301708261,"When a beleaguered office stooge (Dean Jones as Johnny Baxter) is informed that he has just inherited a hotel ""lock, stock, and bar,"" without even bothering to check on it's state, he quits his job and moves his family into the middle of nowhere, with snow.  He has indeed inherited The Grand Imperial Hotel.  From the look of it though, it hasn't seen business in decades.  It's barely a notch above dilapidated.  Low on funds and desperate, dopey Baxter willingly signs a contract he doesn't bother to read.  He's given three thousand dollars from the town's leading sneak (banker Martin Ridgeway, played by Keenan Wynn) to fix the place up.  With an able assist by a squatter (Harry Morgan) and a self-destructive kid of no talent but lots of enthusiasm, Baxter turns his hotel into a ski lodge.  That almost solves their problem, almost.

Snowball Express is a film among many that the Disney Studio churned out at an alarming rate.  It's affable in plot and characters, nothing strenuous.  The humor is good natured, mostly slapstick (Dean Jones skiing to impress, does just that).  The plot twists are hokey and expected.  Nancy Olson is fabulous as his mostly understanding wife.  Harry Morgan is a hoot.  Unfortunately, it tends to waste the considerable talents of Mary Wickes in a do nothing part (she is shown in several scenes but doesn't get to say anything until the very end of the film).

It's a fun film that doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is.  I'm happy to have it in my collection.",1421625600,,1513,4.717557251908397

350719,5,6301708261,Absolutely funny all the way through.  Totally murphy's law until the very end.  One of Walt Disney's all-time movies to see!,1389657600,,125,4.904761904761905
350720,1,6301708261,"I remember this movie with great fondness from my childhood, when it became a tradition in our family to watch it on New Years Eve. I hadn't seen it in years, so I was excited to see that it had been released--and on DVD! I ordered a copy and presented it to my Dad between Christmas and New Years with the intent of our reviving an old tradition. I couldn't believe how excited HE was to see it again. It's really a cheesy movie--though hilarious and with a wonderful star turn by Harry Morgan (Col. Potter of M*A*S*H fame)--but it's one of those that makes you *feel* good. The villain is truly villainous, and Dean Jones is such a goofball for whom *nothing* seems to go right that you root for him and find yourself willingly suspending your disbelief over and over again. Think _The Love Bug_, on snow. (NOTE: I've recently read some comments about the cheerful sexism rampant in the movie; I admit, it's been so long since I've seen it that I don't remember it as well as I would need to in order to comment. And, as you're about to read, I *still* haven't rewatched it.)

So, we set up the movie and settled in to watch--only to have the changer tell us it couldn't read the disc. We switched slots and tried again--nothing. Every other disc but this one will play. I even tried it in my laptop to see if perhaps it just wasn't playing nice with their player for some reason, but my computer couldn't read the disc.

Amazon sent me a replacement (very quickly, by the way), and the same thing happened. The laptop doesn't even recognize that the disc is in DVD format--it asks me to find and install software to allow it to be read.

Since I got two bum discs in a row, I'm giving up for now. I haven't yet seen another comment here expressing a problem, so I'm not certain whether I just got unlucky, or if there's a run of discs that's bad and which no-one else has tried yet. Guess I'll wait a few months and try again. I could stream it, but it would be nice to have a hard copy to share with those who like vintage cheese from Disney.",1389484800,2,2046,4.281653746770026

I saw it for the first time when I was about 10 yrs old (now I'm 49!) with my mom at a movie theater.  We have had such fond memories all these years of laughing so hard at that movie.  I finally decided to look for it on Amazon and was so happy to find it.  A couple of weeks ago, I visited my mom and we watched it for the first time in about 40 years along with five of my children.  We all laughed so hard and had a great time.  I recommend this movie to anyone who likes good, clean comedy.",1330646400,,580,3.7916666666666665
351001,5,6301708261,"well this proved to be a lot of tried and true fun from old school Disney. i hadn't seen this movie since it's first release when i was a kid back in the seventies. i never bothered to rewatch it because i assumed it was pretty routine and standard Disney fare from that time. i didn't think it would hold up as well as the better Disney live-action comedies. i was still right on that it was standard, routine Disney fare from the time, but i was wrong that it wouldn't hold up. it's snow (hah hah pun) classic, but it is still pretty funny stuff some forty years later.
  i was actually suprised at how funny all this was. i've always liked Dean Jones as a actor and thought he was underrated. Harry Morgan is hilarious here as usual. it's also nice to see Nancy Olsen from 'The Absent-minded Professor' working with Disney again. i'm also a big Johhny Whittaker fan and enjoyed seeing him too, although this is hardly the acting role he had in Disney's excellent 'Napoleon and Samantha'.
  look. no one can really claim this is a great film or even a great Disney classic, but it was certainly funny and probably a lot better than non-Disney movies like 'Snow Day' and 'Snow Foolin' that came much later. i thought it was better than Disney's lightweight comedy 'Snow Dogs'. i can't say this film was really about anything at all, but it had a lot of cool sight gags that wouldn't have been out of place in your average Goofy or Donald Duck cartoon.
  hilarious action and a helping of sweet family sentiment make this a definite buy for die hard Disney buffs that enjoy the old school films of Dean Jones or Fred MacMurray.",1326931200,,1627,4.424749163879599

351003,5,6301708261,"I can't pinpoint why, but this is one of my very favorite movies, probably one of my top 5.  Maybe it's the surprising developments in the story and the fact that you and the characters are always simpatico because you don't know any more than they do.  And maybe it's also because it has the perfect blend of laughter, suspense, a sense of adventure, romance, and fighting for a dream.  It's light-hearted and has a great deal of variety, and colorful characters.  I don't think it's possible to DISlike this film.",1307664000,,515,4.626373626373627

I just knew that I generally liked Dean Jones, and the simple style of movies he did for Disney in the late 60's/early 70's. We we sat down to watch this, we were very pleased with it. Our kid is probably too small to get it and sit through it now, but I can see it being a lot of fun for him when he gets older. It really has all the markings of a fun family movie.

HE IS MARRIED!!!!!!  I am trying to teach my children that sex is a beautiful thing between a husband and a wife.  Lustful thoughts about someone other than your spouse is not right.

I've had the VHS tape for several years now. It runs for 93 minutes. I haven't bought the DVD yet, but noticed that it runs 93 minutes too.
I remember when I saw it, that towards the end when Keenan Wynn, asks for a drink of water and an aspirin, he goes into the kitchen. As I remember it, shortly after that noises are heard and then Harry Morgan comes out of the kitchen and informs Nancy Olson that Keenan Wynn has just swallowed a fish. (Don't guess they ever fixed that)
Checking with IMDB it gives a runtime of 99 minutes. I don't think the part I'm missing is 6 minutes long, so I was wondering what else they had cut out.
I know that sometimes the military bases get movies with extra minutes in them, but to me that was the funniest part of the movie.

This was also done with some releases of Excape to Witch Mountain. A scene in which Ike Eisenmann (Tony Malone)was making toys fly around the room while being held in Ray Milland's (Aristotle Bolt) home was missing from my VHS tape.

351105,5,6301708261,"Dean Jones stars as office clerk and family man Johnny Baxter, a job-weary soul whose ship may have just come in. After being informed of an inheritance from a recently deceased, distant relative, Johnny immediately quits his job in a grand fashion and packs up his life and reluctant family to head for Colorado to run the Grand Imperial Hotel. Little does he know that the Grand Imperial is a dilapidated heap. In an effort to revitalize the place, Johnny and family, along with new friends Jesse and Wally, work to fix it up and soon find themselves in debt to a scheming banker (Disney baddie Keenan Wynn) who desires to own the property himself. The idea of turning the area into a ski resort gives the Baxters the needed inspiration to get things rolling, but luck just doesn't seem to be on their side. Or is it?

From Disney's line of 1970's family comedies comes the delightful ""Snowball Express"", a sweet, simple little film with a fantastic cast of Disney favorites like frequent leading-man Dean Jones, legendary villain Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson as wife Sue Baxter, Johnny Whitaker as son Richard and Kathleen Cody as teen daughter Chris, Harry Morgan as squatter Jesse McCord, Michael McGreevey as goofy teen Wally Perkins, and other familiar faces in smaller roles, like Dick Van Patten as Baxter's crabby boss in the city. Is ""Snowball Express"" a five star movie in every sense? Okay, not really, but Amazon defines fives stars as meaning, ""I love it!"" and I do. Without living cars, pirate ghosts, golden-egg laying ducks, or the ability to transform into a dog in this one, Dean Jones must carry this film on his talents alone, and he does it wonderfully! This lighthearted comedy is an excellent lesson on working together, family support, and never giving up, though the importance of persistence is let up a bit in the end with the expected but all too instant and effortless ""happy ending"" resolution. Nevertheless, it's all good, clean, family fun, 70's Disney style! A great comedy to watch with or without the kids when there's snow on the ground or at least the desire for it.

The DVD looks pretty good, a must own for the Disney collector, though it is presented in fullscreen with zero extras. On the bright side of the fullscreen issue, I have been informed from a usually trustworthy source that it appears to only add to the top and bottom rather than actually cropping anything off the sides. So, rather than lose picture you're actually getting more. Still a problem for some who insist on the exact aspect ratio of the theatrical presentation, but as I still have a TV screen shaped like a square, I'm okay with this kind of fullscreen (though, of course, I generally opt for the true theatrical aspect ratio). It's a better presentation than most of Disney's old live-action stuff gets outside of the Vault or Treasures collections.",1226880000,,2867,4.778225806451613
351126,4,6301708261,"Three and a half stars for SNOWBALL EXPRESS.

Here's the plot: When a distant great uncle passes away, harried working drone John Baxter (Dean Jones) inherits the Grand Imperial Hotel in snowy Silver Hill, Colorado. In a highlight moment, Baxter quits his job in grand style, and then off he goes to pack his reluctant family to ski country. They get a shock, however, when they instead arrive at a run-down, deserted shambles of an establishment (the locals dub it ""Crazy Jake's place"").

Bats in the lobby. Raccoons in the oven. An uninvited guest lurking in the shadows. Nevertheless, the Baxters try to make a go at it, converting the hotel into a ski lodge; this, despite the fact that none of them actually knows how to ski. And a conniving banker, with an eye towards John Baxter's inheritance, aims to make things that much harder...

It boils down to this: A perhaps foolhardy venture at a new life. A dilapidated home. Snowball fights. An avalance. A lowdown, dirty trickery. And, it all, more or less, culminates in a wacky snowmobile race and with John Baxter paying attention to his clever kid.

Back in the '60s and '70s, Dean Jones was a staple in Disney cinema. And, like all of his other Disney outings, SNOWBALL EXPRESS, coming out in 1972, showcases Dean's patented everyman charm and accesibility. Like the awesome Fred MacMurray, Dean is down-to-earth and quite believable as an average bloke. Because of this, his reactions to his plights become that much funnier, because we're able to better connect with him and, by extension, the madcap situations in which he lands himself. Note, too, that Dean Jones handles himself just fine with the physical antics. Plus, his characters tend to be a wee bit uptight, further fueling the humor. I really think Dean flaunts one of the better ""royally put upon"" facial expressions out there.

SNOWBALL EXPRESS follows that tried-and-true Disney brand of family sentimentality and awkward goofiness. A Disney flick means that the wife is supportive and loving (this time, she's brought solidly to life by the always lovely and wholesome Nancy Olson), and the kids are juuust a tad rebellious but innately good at heart. The bad guy is oily and shady, in an over-the-top kind of way (as ably done by Keenan Wynn). And, naturally, there's always a lovable pet, this time in the shape of the humongous and cowardly dog, Stoutheart.

Yes, the humor is very silly and slapstick and might even make you roll your eyes. Still, there are some funny bits in here, such as Dean's classic backwards downhill ski and that red-headed kid's attempts to dislodge a massive tree root. Not to mention, the great character actor Harry Morgan drops several good one-liners.

To be honest, this isn't the best of Disney. I don't find SNOWBALL EXPRESS quite as enjoyable as, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Love-Bug-Special-Edition/dp/B000096IAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Love Bug (Special Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackbeard-s-Ghost/dp/B00006472U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackbeard's Ghost</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shaggy-D-A/dp/B000CR7RJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shaggy D.A.</a>.

Johnny Baxter (Dean Jones) is a faceless white collar worker in New York City.  A barely remembered uncle leaves him a hotel with a fancy-sounding name in Colorado and Johnny packs up the family to run the hotel.  Alas, the hotel's name is far fancier than the hotel itself, inhabited by raccoons and a codger (Harry Morgan of ""Dragnet"" and ""M*A*S*H"").  Johnny, his wife Sue (Nancy Olson), son Richard (Johnny Whitaker), and daughter Chris (Kathleen Cody) decide to make a go of the hotel, partially because Johnny has burned a bridge at his old job and partially because of his pride.
Johnny tries to obtain a loan and quickly runs afoul of perennial Disney bad-guy Keenan Wynn, playing ruthless banker Martin Ridgeway.  Johnny is able to borrow money from Ridgeway and fix the hotel to begin taking in paying customers, but as tends to happen in Disney comedies, Johnny tends to be prone to accidents.  In this case the most serious accident comes in the form of a runaway steam engine.
Johnny is placed in a position of having no paying customers and no money, and his next loan payment to Ridgeway is coming due.  Johnny enters a snowmobile race with the help of a local ""expert"" who isn't, and with co-rider Harry Morgan.  Some of the funniest and most unbelievable moments of the movie occur during the snowmobile race.
The ending of the movie unfolds not quite as you might expect, so I'll leave the remainder of the movie for the viewer to discover.

However, the Grand Imperial isn't as ""grand"" as he had imagined, and Baxter decides that with a bank loan, he'll change the hotel into a ski lodge.  The ruthless bank manager wants the hotel for his own greedy purposes, and this leaves Baxter to struggle to make his ski lodge dreams a reality.

Dean Jones is just a normal hard working man when he receives a visit from a lawyer telling him he has inherited a hotel out in the middle of nowhere from a relative he'd basically enver heard of.  When he gets this news he quits his job, and in a unique way at that!
He breaks the news to his wife (Nancy Olsen), daughter, son, and dog, who think he's lost his mind. So the family sets off for Silver Hills, Colorado to take over as managers of their new inheritance. When they arrive, the hotel is FAR from running. It's been run down for years, so with no job, it's up to the family to fix it up and get it running again as fast as they can. Dean then discovers that he has more land than he thought, and decides to change it into a ski lodge. This decision will forever change their lives!
Snowball Express is filled with fun and comedy as Dean continues to steal the show with Disney. If you like The Ugly Dachshund and Blackbeard's Ghost you will enjoy this!
I hope that when and if Snowball Express is released again and on DVD for the first time, Disney will give it some respect and make it worth OUR while!",1024790400,23,1232,4.242553191489361
