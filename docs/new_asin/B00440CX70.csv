8415513,1,B00440CX70,"I too was tricked into purchasing this collection BEFORE the seller had the decency to state that it is only able to be used on a non-US DVD player!  We had a playable version prior to our total loss house fire that our entire family loved!  I looked forward to many years of use with nieces and nephews and perhaps my own grand babies some days.  After all my mom still shows my children VHS that we had as little kids.  Now I am out a lot more money than the seller is charging now that they had to tell the truth!  I only wished I would have disputed this and posted it sooner.  Unfortunately I was dealing with the aftermath of loosing everything, to include pets, in such a terrible way.  I would also like to note that ours came used, beat up pretty badly, and many discs are scratched.  If I do end up finding a special DVD player I have no guarantees on if they will work or not!  This entire purchase was a scam, buyer beware!",1496361600,2,935,4.15

8415517,5,B00440CX70,"a wholsome and very charming cartoon series. i wish such typical of preschool cartoons produced in the United States. Make sure you have a region X DVD player, though.",1407024000,,167,4.793103448275862
8415518,1,B00440CX70,"I ordered this DVD in the US.  In the description there was no mention on regional information.  When I finally received the DVD I found out that it is not compatible with DVD players sold in the US; it can only play on a region2 DVD player or a region free DVD player.
***IF IN THE US DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY***",1391040000,12,322,4.095238095238095
