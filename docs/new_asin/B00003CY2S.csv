1328378,3,B00003CY2S,"Edwards Burns is the writer, director, and one of the stars of this movie.  He also wrote/directed ""She's the One"", and ""The Brothers McMullen"". He is sort of a male Nora Ephron.  He can write about romantic situations in modern day, and make them seem funny, serious, and realistic to some extent.  and we know where he has set this movie.
""Sidewalks of New York"" is his latest work.  There is a lot of talking in this film, unfortunately one word that begins with f, and it is not a nice word, is way too overused here.  That is my only problem with this movie.
Otherwise, I liked it alot.  There wasn't really any plot, it was very subtle.  It is filmed somewhat in a documentary style, where six people are being interviewed about their relationships and their sex lives as they live them. It's very interesting.
I also felt that there is such an honesty to the approach of the all actors and actresses as they speak their lines straight on into the camera.  It seems as if they could have just been talking to me, or you.  The acting in the film was all very good especially by Stanley Tucci.  He plays the sleazeball cheating husband very well. Also, Dennis Farina, is hysterical as Edward Burns' older buddy.
It is a pretty funny movie, and it has some great lines. I just don't appreciate that f word being used so much in films.  It doesn't add anything to a movie for me; it actually takes away. In this case, it took away one star.
I still recommend it.  It's a good choice for a romantic comedy with some drama thrown in.",1023408000,2,1533,4.3780918727915195

1328422,1,B00003CY2S,"I disliked this movie because the language was horrendous.  Someone doesn't know how to write without dropping an F bombs constantly.  It would be interesting to count the number of times...I'm guessing in the 3 digits.  It is about several different people and their relationship confusions. The premise was actually interesting but it's disgusting and depressing.  There are no moral standards in these relationships.  It would be depressing if this is how everyone thought.  Does Hollywood not know there are actual people out there who have relationships with love, integrity, depth, commitment, mutual appreciation and with solid foundations?  If the author doesn't think so, he's hanging out with the wrong crowds and needs to make some new acquaintances!  Maybe he needs to get out of New York and spend some time in the South where you have couples like my parents who married as virgins and stayed married from the time they were 18 to 83, dying 11 weeks apart from one another.  Write about someone like THEM not nasty characters like these with no moral compass or wisdom.",1514937600,,1083,5.005586592178771

SIDEWALKS gives us a 'feel' of how Edward may have been struggling to get a toe-hold on the feelings and motivations of young people.

No one has said this to me, but my feeling is it helped lay the foundation for his better movies, not yet made. Not always fun, but thoroughly thought provoking!  She's the One was 1,000% great fun.

It was enjoyable to see actors in a movie when they were so young (NYC before 9/11). Film style is partially in interview with jumpy camera handling for realism and it adds to the moc-documentary.

1328556,4,B00003CY2S,"I didn't like the film at first. The device of having the characters speak directly into the camera seemed overly arty.  I found the opening questions about their sex lives to be a little off-putting.  The actress who played the waitress/NYU student seemed like a wannabe Meg Ryan.  But, for some reason I stuck with it and after about 20 minutes my annoyance gave way to moderate interest and then somewhere along the line I started to like it.

Many have compared this to Woody Allen's films, especially those set in Manhattan.  There is a similarity of style and theme but the difference between the two men comes through loud and clear.  To me, Allen is probably smarter and certainly more hip, but Burns has the bigger heart and his films come through as more humane and satisfying.

The cast is really very good and the stories intertwine cleverly and realistically.  Burns is always charming and his particular brand of story telling is very appealing to me.  But then I like Norman Rockwell, too....",1387929600,,1007,4.741379310344827

A movie for mature audience, preferably living in a big city.

The cast is wonderful. Edward Burns directs and stars in the movie (and he does a phenomenal job at both tasks).
His acting and mannerism, and even speech remind me of Ben Affleck.

The movie is shot in a mockumentary-style.  Each character is interviewed in the process of filming.
That gives the film extra sense of realism.  The movie also has one of the best couple-argument scenes in the history of film-making, I would say.",1387584000,,546,4.71578947368421

That device in a film, seems cheap, easy and too 'commercial media' for my taste.  When Woody does it (Woody Allen), it tends to work more times than not, but it only annoys me here because the characters seem too contrived to be the 'man/woman on the street-type."" For me, film is about showing, not telling.  Let me see in the behavior of the characters what it is you, as a director, writer, want me to see. Show me, don't preach or tell. Ed is good at capturing a relationship idea and workin' it out...usually, but not so much here. Much of the behavior of the principals is believable, but so cliche and predictable and uninspiring. More importantly, we don't really learn anything new about how to manage, navigate and endure the ineffable and awesome experience of being in intimate relationships, be they monogamous or not.

1328566,4,B00003CY2S,"This film plays out as an homage to Woody Allen - both in plot and stylistic, formal filmic choices of the writer/director.

If you're a fan of Woody Allen - it's well worth the view.

In all actuality, it's a ""poor-man's"" Woody Allen film done by Edward Burns (and this is not to indicate a pejorative slant on the categorization). NB: It does not come close to, ""When Harry Met Sally"" - another (and major, I admit) homage to Allen!

Burns does however, shamelessly rip-off lines from Allen's ""Husbands and Wives""- see Mia Farrow's confrontation with Allen's character regarding the impossibility of him surviving outside of New York for more than a day or so as he's waxing philosophical about an ""author's"" idealized life in the cafes of Paris...

1328568,5,B00003CY2S,"After owning this movie for a few years (on the strength of seeing a portion on IFC), I finally got around to seeing it beginning-to-end. As others have said, the acting is nuanced and fresh, the style is Indie, and the comparison is with earlier films written and directed by Woody Allen.

However, I find two things most interesting. The first is the way the movie makes it very clear that most of the characters' suffering arises from their failure to honor and respect the institution of marriage. The second thing I found interesting is the failure of every other review to discover and reflect on this movie as a cautionary tale. I found it easy to imagine this film as a good conversation-starter for couples seriously thinking of becoming married or someone considering having sex outside of marriage.

I understand how both things are beyond the pale of what people deem interesting enough to comment on these days. However, as I reflect back on a life of many mistakes in the area of relationships, I find strong similarities between it and the behavior of all the characters in the film. The failure of other reviewers to even remark in passing on the content of this cultural narrative sugggests (to me at least) how completely amoral (or a-something) we have become.

Consider the enormous damage: a young man gets married ""too early"" and cheats on his wife... she is unforgiving, traumatized, and divorces him, only to sleep with the next man on their second date (to his surprise). Then, she does not call him back, and after a chance encounter, becomes too conflicted to call him back a second time even after learning that she is carrying his child. A second man is completely self-deluded and narrowly self-serving as he ignores his wife and sleeps with a young woman half his age... and she ignores the fact that he is married and sleeps with him! At the end, we are left with people stumbling in and out of each other's beds, and occasionally producing children who will grow up with only one biological parent.

This movie does an excellent job of bringing all this turmoil and suffering into clear focus and, too my mind at least, shows how indifference to long-standing cultural mores and opportunity destroys lives, unnecessarily propagates suffering, etc. From my point of view, this earns the film a fifth star for ""relevance"" to contemporary American life.",1315526400,3,2383,4.819070904645477
1328569,4,B00003CY2S,"Ed Burns.  What do you say about Ed Burns?  He's hot.  He's a talented actor.  As for writing and directing, he's no Woody Allen.  I found this film to be very amusing.  At the same time, it has a distinct Woody Allen-esque feel that was somewhat wasted on the material.  From the music to the style of filming, it seemed like Mr. Burns too strictly emulated his predecessor.  That being said, what was better about the Burns film in comparison to Allen films was that while Allen reserves his best dialogue for the male characters, Burns assigns the best lines to his female characters.  The best was the intermittent discussion of cologne on balls.  The only thing that could have been better would have been to answer the question, ""Why do some men put cologne on their balls?""  Thanks, Mr. Burns!",1297036800,,800,4.602836879432624
1328570,5,B00003CY2S,A great film for any Ed Burns fan.  I have every movie he has written and directed and in true Ed Burns fashion this is a movie that is a classic.  It is based on the game 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon where everyone you meet is in someway connected.  It is a great movie with great subplots and great characters and it is very much character driven.  It is well written and never loses its way even amongst the individual stories that all interplay.  A great movie for any Ed Burns fan or just anyone who loves New York.  A great concept and a great movie.  I would recommend.,1280966400,,572,4.1454545454545455
1328571,1,B00003CY2S,"This may well be an accurate slice of (modern) life movie, but it just seemed sleazy. It had no charm or romance. Perhaps, this is what life has become, thanks in large measure to films, etc. like this. Earlier works by Burns were much better. An earlier review likened this movie to a Woody Allen movie - there's no resemblance - Woody Allen's movies, generally, are very witty and insightful whereas this movie was merely crude. Admittedly, Dennis Farina's character was crude AND funny. I found it depressing and disgusting.",1266624000,3,527,4.866666666666666
1328572,2,B00003CY2S,"I didn't like this movie very much. Most of the acting was fine, but the characters weren't very likable on the whole. I watched this with my teen-aged daughter and cringed at the over-the-top discussions of sex--how many partners each character had had (one claimed over 500) and at what age they first had sex. (The movie opens with each character discussing the number of partners.) And we have yet another movie relying on footage shot in New York to seem cosmopolitan or hip or something. Was it terrible? No. I watched until the end. Was it very good? No.",1201996800,4,561,4.62
1328573,4,B00003CY2S,"I hate Ed Burns.  I think Rosario Dawson could go back to acting school.  I have always felt a nervous twitch come on whenever Brittany Murphy speaks (like fingernails on a chalkboard).  Then, alas, Heather Graham is only worth watching when directed by either PT Anderson or by early David Lynch.  So, with a line up like this, I thought this would be a simple, and rather disappointing, film to view.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Sidewalks of New York captured my attention with its unique storytelling ability, the quickness of the character development, and the underused talent that Stanley Tucci brought to this project.  I also believe that what me enjoy this film further than I have other Edward Burns films (i.e. I HATED The Brothers McMullen) is that it wasn't your typical Ed Burns film.  It was obvious, from the opening scene that he was the center focus, but it just didn't have the typical Ed Burns feel to it.  This film felt fresh, not so ""in your New York face"" or centered on ethnicity as the others have, but instead about romance, sex, relationships, and personal responsibility.  For me, Sidewalks worked because the characters worked together.  This wasn't just Ed Burns focusing the camera on himself, but allowing others to speak around him.  It felt like a conversation with Ed Burns and his friends, not just Ed Burns.  Also, how can you disrespect a film where Stanley Tucci gives a phenomenal performance (completely taking away the Burns spotlight)!

Pulled from an earlier release date because of 9/11, this film couldn't have made you feel more at home in New York than actually being there in person.  I mentioned before that Burns fantastically takes the viewer away from you typical New York scenery and plants you IN New York (if that makes sense).  He doesn't overpower you with the clich&eacute; images of the Empire State building, the Statue of Liberty, or other overblown New York images, but instead makes you feel like you actually live there.  Burns, surprisingly, didn't develop the city as I assumed he would, but instead developed our characters.  Burns' decision to make this film into a half-documentary, half-feature film was brilliant.  New York is a fast pace town, and Burns captures that with his choice of direction.  He jumps us quickly between characters, witnessing how fast a relationship can blossom in the city that never sleeps.  One would normally think that this would be confusing, but for me, it kept me glued to the screen.  Cylindrical storylines?  Wasn't this technique so ... yesterday?  Perhaps, but Burns is able to keep the flow moving and the characters fun, which cannot be found in most of the knock-offs post-Magnolia.  I believe that for one of the first times, Burns demonstrated his directing chops extremely well.  He went outside of his norm, while keeping with the patented Burns seal of approval.

When I first began this film I was upset with the choice of actors.  It was obvious that Burns chose his friends to star in this film.  Budget was tight and time was short, so why not.  I have no trouble with this.  My trouble is that his friends do not appeal to me as a film watcher.  I have not seen (outside of Sin City in which Rosario and Brittany were animated) a worth wile film with a majority of our lead characters.  Heather Graham flip-flops between decent and poor, while Brittany just seems like she isn't acting, but instead just playing ""herself"".  I wasn't interested in the characters when I started this film, I just wanted to see how Burns would handle mediocre talent.  I must admit, he surprised me.  While Murphy, Graham, and Dawson were not ""jump-for-joy"" amazing, they worked well together.  The script worked with these characters.  There wasn't big shoes to fill, and I think even the low rung of the Hollywood ladder could handle this story, which kept me at ease.  What really impressed me was that Tucci was jaw dropping.  It was nothing that he would in an award for, but definitely the stand out talent of the film.  For some very strange reason, he captivated me in this movie.  I wasn't expecting the performance to be that good.  I know, many of you think that this was a poor film, how could anyone's talent be that good?  My thought is that Tucci stood out because nobody else was reaching the bar.  The acting wasn't bad, it just felt sterile, but with Tucci that all changed.  He kept Sidewalks of New York from sinking deep into the cinephile lagoon.

Was this a movie about sex or relationships?  That is the ultimate question to ask yourself as you watch Burns' comedy/drama.  It is a question I asked myself as I watched it, so I want you to ask it as well.  Sex is the topic of choice, but I think what makes Burns' film stand aside of the others is that it deals with honest relationships.  This isn't just your typical boy falls for girl, but girl doesn't want boy relationships.  This film is more about the truthfulness of individuals and the passion they evoke.  I liked the stories that Burns wove together for me.  This wasn't top shelf cinema, but it did entertain.  Burns stories that he wrote were comical, yet exciting at the same time.  We felt for these characters (even if they were not played well by the actors ... outside of Tucci) and loved the city that they inhabited.  This film reminded me of watching Sex & the City.  That television program was exciting to me because of the city and because you believe anything can happen in that city.  Love can be found in video stores, coffee shops, and real-estate visits.

Call me genuinely sappy, but Sidewalks of New York deserves a second viewing.  Even if you hated it the first time, watch it for Tucci.  That man can take paper-thin characters and turn them into gold!!

1328575,5,B00003CY2S,"Ed Burns scored a home-run in this movie. If I didn't know better, I'd have sworn it was a Woody Allen film, it had that same combination of funny, warm, honest, dry, slice-of-life humor.

All the characters were believeable, realistic and perfectly cast. Stanley Tucci was perfect as the pathological philandering husband to Heather Graham, who played up the 'highstrung-ness that is characteristic of Allen's leading ladies (Farrow, Keaton)to a 'T'. Meanwhile, Brittany Murphy was admirable as the young and impressionable, but still remarkably self-sufficient love interest to Tucci.

Ed Burns handled his roles as director/actor/writer superbly, as the hot leading man to both Graham and Rosario Dawson. Dawson plays Burns' flaky and indecisively sometimey love interest well; her scene with Burns, outside Burns's house never fails to annoy me, which I guess just goes to show how well Dawson plays her role.

My favorite part of this movie hands down though, is the scene where Burn's older man-friend, played by Dennis Farina, gives Burns 'dating advice'. The way in which Farina confidently insists that Burns ""put some cologne on [his] balls"" never fails to have me rolling with laughter. What a leech. And what makes it funnier is that Farina really does believe his own advice.  Clearly both men come from different schools of 'how to be win over the ladies'. Guess which one Farina comes from?

That this movie isn't all laughs lends to the Allen-esque feel and makes it more endearing.  There are several  touching scenes: the interactions between Tucci and Murphy in their disfunctional affair; the scenes between Graham and Tucci as she realizes what a ferret she has for a husband; the scenes between Burns and Dawson, where you almost what to slap Dawson out of her inertia; and the scenes where Dawson's ex husband, (played by David Krumholtz) plays guitar to himself in his lonely NY apt bathroom.

This is one of my favorite movies for all the same reasons I like Woody Allen's movies: You laugh, you cry, you want to reach out and hug/slap/shake one of the characters, but you ultimately end the movie on a high, feeling lucky -despite it's frequent ups and downs- to be part of this topsy-turvy, rollercoaster-whirlwind of a ride we call ""Life"".",1129852800,5,2267,5.01063829787234

(I mean, I don't care for Celine Dion, so I don't listen to her music.  Make some choices, folks.)  This is a talky, quirky film that follows six interconnected characters who live in New York.  We get Burns as a disillusioned TV producer, Stanley Tucci as a cheating dentist, Rosario Dawson as a cautious schoolteacher, Heather Graham as a real estate agent with traditional values, Brittany Murphy as a college student, and David Krumholtz as a slightly grating but sincere doorman.  Even though none of the characters were perfect, they all had real human qualities and imperfections.  Even Krumholtz' annoying doorman character manages to show some emotional realism at several points.  If you liked She's the One or The Brothers McMullen, or if you just like small, ""indie"" movies with good characters, this is worth seeing.  It's reminiscent of Woody Allen (some reviewers think that's a bad thing..?), but Woody hasn't done a film this good (or as relevant to Gen-X/Gen-Y) in years.  It's shot in a documentary style, with mock interviews sprinkled throughout in which the characters talk about their personal lives, including marriage, sex, and the complicated situations that can occur between people.  Heather Graham actually has a monologue that's a little eerie, talking about how our society has nothing to worry about anymore, how we have no threats, etc., and as a result we spend our time worrying about our relationships.  In another scene she talks about how her parents and grandparents made sacrifices, lived through wars, and yet managed to hold on to their values, keep their families together, etc.  This all would've gone right by me had I not seen the WTC in so many shots.  Definitely a snapshot of a pre-9/11 ""safe at home"" mentality, but the relationship themes are still universal.  It's interesting to see that even 9/11 hasn't affected how people view relationships -- just how we view our world.",1100995200,5,2103,5.020172910662824

""Sidewalks"" is, like his other films, an honest look at everyday people and this thing we call love. The film is humourous, touching, and insightful.  Although, since the movie is shot in documentary style, it makes it seem even more like a slice of life.  With on-street interviews, jarring camera work and jump-cuts, the movie has the look of a PBS piece.  But that's a good thing.

Then there is slobby vulgarity including adoloscent malarkey about applying cologne to your pubic areas or forgetting to shower before dates. There is an annoyingly prolonged shot of Ed Burns' armpits.
What really gets your goat after a while though is the endless chitter chatter that lacks any semplance of sense or wit.

1328586,3,B00003CY2S,"""Sidewalks of New York"" is an interesting evening's entertainment.  Edward Burns is a good romantic lead despite his high-pitched raspy voice.  He always seems to be going in two different directions at once, which makes him interesting to watch.  One reviewer said that the problem with this as a romantic comedy is that there are no really good guys.  Even Ed Burns' character Tommy hits on Annie (Heather Graham) when he's seeing Maria (Rosario Dawson).  Maybe the good guys just don't live in New York!  Overall, I liked the women characters much more than the men.  David Krumholtz as Ben walks around in an doorman's uniform.  He had a small part in ""The Mexican"" with Brad Pitt & Julia Roberts and was memorable in ""10 Things I Hate About You.""  He does a nice job of being a passive-aggressive romancer.  Dennis Farina is hysterical as the self-involved Romeo who counsels Tommy on how to successfully hit on women with the memorable pearl that he should spray cologne on his balls, only to have Maria wonder about what kind of guy would do that after their first date.  Stanley Tucci who was great as Puck in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" plays the chronic cheating husband who worries about his size to the hilt.  Heather Graham who did a nice job in ""From Hell"" with Johnny Depp and also appeared in ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" is most real as the pretty wife with traditional values.  Rosario Dawson who played with Will Smith in ""Men In Black II"" does a great job as the school teacher who dates Tommy.  Brittany Murphy is accomplished as the waitress Ashley who has an affair with Stanley Tucci's Griffin.  From her role opposite Michael Douglas in ""Don't Say A Word"" to her part in ""Girl, Interrupted"" and even her splash in ""Riding In Cars With Boys,"" she shows great range as an actress.  Nadia Dajani as Annie's (Heather Graham) best friend does a great job as she did in ""Happy Accidents.""
The DVD version is somewhat interesting.  With the film shot in only 16 days, there weren't deleted scenes to watch.  The commentary was a bit repetitive since Burns and Dawson were the only two actors interviewed; and the same clips kept repeating.  Even having the gaffer's insights on the film seemed like they were trying to stretch the commentary.  I didn't find it to add much to the cinematic experience.
Yes, it would have been nice to have one guy that we really liked.  Yes, the movie is certainly not a ""comedy"" that is as funny as ""Sex In the City.""  Yes, there's not really a plot so much as a character snapshot.  But this is a film that keeps our attention.  All in all, it's an interesting evening's entertainment.

1328591,5,B00003CY2S,"Prior to seeing Woody Allen's worst movie, ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,"" I probably would have given Ed Burns's ""Sidewalks of New York"" a 4 star review because it was too derivative of Woody Allen's work.  However, ""Curse"" showed that Allen is now past being able to make this kind of film and that someone new must step up to the writing, directing, acting helm of these gem-like, relationship slice-of-life films.  Ed Burns fills that void very nicely indeed and it is a lot to ask, that someone be able to write, direct and act.  Burns himself will never be a comic like Woody Allen but he is a more credible romantic leading man, being young, handsome and with attractive ways about him. This film takes a handful of New Yorkers and puts them into a variety of relationship quandries.

Stanley Tucci portrays the least sympathetic as a dentist who suffers from chronic infidelity no matter to whom he is currently married.  I was glad to see Brittany Murphy in another role after seeing her play the psychiatric patient to Michael Douglas's psychiatrist in last year's thriller.  She is an actress to watch as she is quite different here as Tucci's girlfriend who starts angling towards a New York doorman on the side.  Heather Graham does a Mia Farrow like role as Annie, who becomes the Burns the love interest, although it is nip and tuck with the Rosario Dawson biracial teacher with Burns first. There is a scene stealer in this movie though and that actor is Dennis Farina as the older man who counsels Burns on seducing women throughout.  He is an absolute lounge lizard creep, a complete turnoff to women everywhere, but I was laughing out loud and holding my sides every time he was on camera. The scene of him lounging in his bubble bath, while counseling Burns to splash cologne on his privates to increase his ""action,"" is emblazoned across my memory forever, I'm afraid!

I fail to understand why anyone thought Burns should erase the twin towers from his film, our being able to see them in the background.  Should we erase Gettysburg off the map too so we can pretend the Civil War never happened?  Or the coast of Normandy to pretend World War II never was?  The thinking behind this notion of eradicating history from appearing in our films, even as background, I find very disturbing.

1328592,2,B00003CY2S,"Sidewalks of New York is a film that wants oh-so-badly to be 'hip.'  Unfortunately for Mr. Burns, trying to be 'hip' is the one thing that is absolutely guaranteed to spoil the effect.  It is also a film that desperately wants to be Husbands and Wives.  Again, unfortunately, Burns is decidedly no Woody Allen.
I actually sort of vaguely remember maybe liking She's the One, but I barely remember that film at all, so I'm going to go ahead and say that he isn't a very good filmmaker.  Life just isn't fair, is it?
Burns seems to have a reputation for being able to write good dialogue, but he really  can't--no, what he does is write his approximation of how he thinks cool people ought to talk, peppered with his own allegedly clever commentary about love, which essentially boils down to shockers about how men and women are, you know, different, and relationships are, you know complicated--for a film that's meant to be a hip, irreverant view of relationships, there's precious little actual insight here.  I'd go so far as to say there's none, actually.
Burns's characters are--let's not fool ourselves--shallow and dull.  Not that shallow and dull characters can't be made to be interesting, but Burns, as previously noted, is no Woody Allen.  And in any case, they're not MEANT to be that way here.  They are annoying and artificial, with somewhat disturbingly one-tracked minds (sex, natch), frequently acting how Burns needs them to act to get a properly pat ending, rather than in any way that actual humans would behave.  And on a side note, how is it that a movie about Modern Love has no gay characters?
Okay, so it's not all bad--I liked it when characters yelled at each other, (yelling's always fun), and Dennis Farina is somewhat amusing as a uber-Don Juan type, but honestly, people, is this what passes for clever nowadays?

Dennis Farina who is not one of the original six almost steals the movie.,1523577600,,344,4.655737704918033

7918545,1,B00003CY2S,"BOOOOORINGGGGG.  The sidewalks of New York City are much more dramatic.  Too bad because I like the individual performances.  It's just that they never come together ---no chemistry, no excitement, and it's the opposite of sexy/crazy/cool...the opposite of NYC.  The only interesting thing here are all of the intersecting relationships.  If you like human puzzles, this might interest you.",1522713600,,390,5.5423728813559325
7918546,2,B00003CY2S,I am pretty sure that Neil Patrick Harris plays the blond punk rock band member and also the yuppie who wants to build a log cabin in the woods. Uncredited. Am I crazy?,1519344000,,168,4.121212121212121
