5940207,5,B00ESL6GMI,"What wonderful memories I have enjoyed watching all the episodes I wish I could turn back the clock and go back to that time, even as turbulent as it may have been at least we stood for something other than making money, we had causes!!",1392249600,,236,4.266666666666667

5940209,5,B00ESL6GMI,The Mod Squad is an awesome #1 classic TV Police show I ever saw and Michael Cole known as Pete Cochran is so gorgeous all the way!,1391385600,,131,3.888888888888889
5940210,5,B00ESL6GMI,One of my favorite shows from my youth ... glad the final seasons have finally come out on DVD ...  this is a great set to have ... I thoroughly enjoyed seeing these episodes again after all these years !,1391212800,,204,4.1
5940211,3,B00ESL6GMI,"I like this show and am glad I have it on DVD, but by this time, I feel the show had used up all of its good story lines and I could see why this was the last season of the series. I really like the actors and actresses in this series, but it was just ok to me, not great like the first few season's of the show.",1391040000,,312,3.536231884057971
5940212,5,B00ESL6GMI,"Sadly here in Australia, Seasons 2 - 5 of The Mod Squad are not available, only Season 1 Volumes 1 & 2, even thou when it originally aired here in the early 70's, it was a high rated show, which is sad for fans such as myself who never saw the original runs. Sadly too, it has never been back on Australian TV as repeats/reruns. Thanks to sites such as Amazon, I can purchase the rest of the remaining 4 seasons with no problems.
A great buy, as I was eagerly awaiting the release of Season 5 Volumes 1 & 2!",1390780800,,507,4.02970297029703
5940213,1,B00ESL6GMI,"The DVDs have spots where you can't watch the show. I was going to return the 1st DVDs purchased.  When I received the 2nd set, there were different spots unable to watch. I kept both of them because of the different problems. I have had problems with the other seasons also. I will say that Amazon has been very helpful in trying to correct the problem. I just didn't think that after 2 sets it would make a difference.",1390435200,,420,4.3164556962025316
5940214,5,B00ESL6GMI,"The Mod Squad, Volumes One & Two { 1 & 2 } is in my Opinion, Equally as Good as the other four { 4 } Season's.  In my own Opinion, I would have to say that if you're someone that really likes Suspense, Action, Caring for Other People, Respect, Understanding, having Patient's, you Don't go Rushing Anything and Everything, you're a Very Patient, willing to Wait type of a person, then in my own Opinion, I would have to say that you will really Enjoy Season Five { 5 } of The Mod Squad.  Personnally, I Highly Reccamend the Entire Series of the Mod Squad to Anyone and Everyone.",1390003200,,578,4.245454545454545
5940215,4,B00ESL6GMI,"This  set had little better quality then season 5. The show is really great, as I said. I am glad to have them for my collection. The same issues apply with no flaps and the way the discs are attached. The case is cheap, for the money also you have to dislodge the disc, and it's to tight it break the disc if one is not careful. The discs in all these shows are not made like they were when TV DVD first cam out. Again, the show is a five it's the issues that bring it down.",1389312000,,475,3.8469387755102042
