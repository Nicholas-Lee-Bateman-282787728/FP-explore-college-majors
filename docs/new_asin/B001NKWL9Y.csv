DVD offers a great balance between inspiration, realism, and concrete steps to organizing/ structuring your time and energy to manifest life work that is productive, fulfilling, valuable, and profitable ---- a great snapshot/ summary of Dr. Demartini's teachings and perfect for people who learn best when information is delivered verbally (as I do). Highly recommend.",1385078400,,417,5.430769230769231
8327296,5,B001NKWL9Y,"This is a brilliant summary of Dr Demartini's core teachings and theories.  It is great to watch and learn from someone who presents a balance view of how the universe works as opposed to the ""positive thinking"" indoctrination that leads to people setting unrealistic goals they keep failing to achieve.  If you are passionate about making the most of the time you are on the planet - I highly recommend buying this DVD and watching it every 6 months.  There is way too much top quality information to take in on a single viewing. Amazing value for money!",1320537600,,555,4.642857142857143
8327297,5,B001NKWL9Y,"It seems to me this is a Q & A session from a conference he spoke at with a short interview edited and inserted at various points throughout not movie or documentary. Although the title is misleading I found the information and wisdom to be some of the best I've heard from Dr. Demartini (I came away with 4 pages of typed notes).

He covers many topics such as:
1. How to make a big impact in the world
2. What to do when people don't believe in you and your dream
3. How to deal with negative circumstances in your life
4. The 7 fears that hold us back from reaching are dream
5. The importance of a vision and purpose in life
6. Wisdom on each of the 7 areas of life which are Mental, Health, Relationships, Social, Family, Career, and Financial

Overall a great dvd I've watched it 3 times so far.

8327298,3,B001NKWL9Y,"I just watched this video. First if this is actually Dr. Demartini's DVD
""The Infinite Wisdom of Love"" Repackages as ""The Secret of the Law of Attraction 2: The Infinite Wisdom of Love"" It is in the old package and has a sleeve over it with the new title. Obviously this is to capitalize on the popularity of ""The Secret"" and ""The Law of Attraction"" since more people are searching for that than ""Love"". Just smart marketing publishers do this all of the time. BTW buying this here is much cheaper than on his own site where it cost $40 under the old title.

The video is NOT a movie like it says but scenes from his lecture along with a question and answer interview.

This is not at all what I was expecting...and it did not give me what I was looking for regarding love and manifesting.

It however did have a lot of good information and wisdom. Much of the advice is very useful. The last 20 or so minutes is just concept after concept and axiom after axiom with not a lot of detail.

I will watch it again there is some good info to absorb...I do not agree with all that he says but most of what he says is good advice for anyone.

Many people look for reasons to complain or pick products apart about production value, or a rehashing of content which all authors do.

My personal way of valuing something is that if I get one thing, one piece of information that is useful to me I am happy and then of course I must take action and apply it.

So I will say I am happy with my purchase.",1243814400,15,1491,4.174216027874564
