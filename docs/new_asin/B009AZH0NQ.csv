8538940,5,B009AZH0NQ,"All my boys (2, 5, 9) love this show. It does clearly state Bible verses and is very entertaining to watch. The monster trucks talk and have childlike voices and they make mistakes like kids do and then learn from their mistakes.",1486512000,,229,4.476190476190476

8538943,5,B009AZH0NQ,A MUST buy for any little kid who's into monster trucks! The cartoon is well made with good graphics and storylines. Plus they will learn a valuable lesson from scripture!,1425168000,,171,4.733333333333333
8538944,4,B009AZH0NQ,"These are very cute little movies - ""Monster Trucks"" - that have themes that little ones face every day.  The storylines addresses the  problems, shows consequences, and then gives information of what the ""truck"" should have done - all within the scope of a Christian theme.  The video has good picture quality, the ""trucks"" are easy to understand, and has cute music to go with it!  Very appealing to little ones.  In today's world, it is refreshing to find good video for kids that doesn't involve violence, cussing, etc.  Small price to pay for an interesting video that will visually illustrate how to handle some of the situations the kids may/will face as they grow.  Thee is a series of these and they are all well made and interesting to watch.",1423785600,2,752,4.694656488549619
8538945,5,B009AZH0NQ,"My grandson loves all things cars, trucks, or wheels. When I saw that this little series had such a good character-building background, I was impressed. Instead of just watching junk tv, he can learn about being a good friend, bullying, and respecting parents.",1406851200,3,260,5.069767441860465
