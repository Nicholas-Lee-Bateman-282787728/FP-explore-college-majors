7926392,2,B00004Y2QR,"Plan 9, like all Ed Wood films, has become too well known to properly be considered cult. This was someone who sincerely tried to make films without any budget whatsoever. The fact that these even made it into theatres was an accomplishment.
While Plan 9 is often considered the worst film, it isn't as bad is most make it out to be. One can watch this film from beginning to end without the urge to throw one's television out the window (try that with Howard The Duck). Granted he didn't produce much quality in his work, but had he been given a real budget who knows what he could have produced.",1088208000,2,597,4.387387387387387
7926393,4,B00004Y2QR,"Before you get too excited over this, you should know that these are Wade Williams releases, and as such they are quite cheap in terms of quality. Three of the DVDs contain no extra features at all, having only the movie and a theatrical trailer.
A further problem is with the sound on these DVDs. All except for ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" sound muted. I can't understand why Wade Williams didn't clear these problems up, or at the very least hired somebody like Cary Roan to do so.
But all of my complaining aside, these are enjoyable films, despite this treatment. They are, in order:
1) ""Glen or Glenda"" (1953, 68 minutes): Ed Wood's first major film! A very poorly acted retelling of the making of this movie can be found in the Tim Burton movie, but this is the original article, one of the more beloved of films by Ed Wood fans. This is also his most autobiographical, in it's tale of a man who enjoys dressing in women's clothing and has an angora fetish. With Bela Lugosi and Dolores Fuller.
2) ""Jail Bait"" (1954, 71 mins.): No mention of this movie was made in the ""Ed Wood"" film, due perhaps to the fact that Bela Lugosi was not in this. A part had been written for Bela, but the venerable actor was in the hospital when this was made. The part that Lugosi would have play, kindly Dr. Boris Gregor, went to actor Herbert Rawlinson. This is the most boring of titles in this collection; I think that it would have been better had they substituted ""Night of the Ghouls"" for this.
3) ""Bride of the Monster"" (1956, 69 mins.): This was always my personal favourite of all of Wood's movies. I don't know why. Bela's final film with Ed during his lifetime, playing mad scientist Eric Vornoff, striving to create a race of atomic supermen who can, apparently, deflect bullets by scowling at them. This introduces Paul Marco as Kelton the cop, a part that he would reprise for the Ed Wood movies ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Night of the Ghouls"".
4)""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (1959, 78 mins.): The best of the discs! The quality of this disc more than makes up for the lack in the others. The box says ""almost starring Bela Lugosi"", and this DVD has the best individual container, as well as the best looking disc. With Vampira, Jerome King Criswell, Tor Johnson, Conrad Brooks, and the wonderful Paul Marco, this is the tale of a group of aliens activating their 9th plan to take over Earth (the first 8 plans failed). This one also contains the documentary film ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion. This documentary is much longer than the original film, and provides a much more accurate view of this movie than Burton was capable of bringing to the screen.
If you are a Woodian I would suggest you get this collection; if you are only curious you would probably do better to buy any one of these individually to see if you like it. It is my hope that soon enough of Ed Wood's remaining films will be available on DVD for ""The Worst of Ed Wood II"".",1050710400,18,2969,4.4495412844036695
7926394,1,B00004Y2QR,"Anybody who appreciates the fine art of bad filmmaking are going to want this boxed set. All four of the films here are by Ed Wood, who (if you do not already know) was voted the worst director of all time in a Golden Turkey Awards survey. This set contains his greatest achievements:
Glen or Glenda &#8211; Ed Wood's first film, and arguably his most incompetent. He stars as Glen (under the alias Daniel Davis), a normal man who just happens to be a transvestite, like Wood himself. Random stock footage is everywhere. Bela Lugosi narrates semi-coherently.
Jail Bait &#8211; No, not a college sex comedy, but a crime thriller and &#8220;Dragnet&#8221; rip off. Cops Lyle Talbot and Steve &#8220;Hercules&#8221; Reeves are on the trail of two cop killers and robbers, as the father and sister of one of them try to help. Also starring Ed's girlfriend Dolores Fuller.
Bride of the Monster &#8211; Hilariously incompetent turd, with Bela Lugosi hamming it up as Dr. Eric Varnoff, a mad scientist with a penchant for strange atomic experiments. Tor Johnson plays his mute assistant, Lobo. Paul Marco makes his debut appearance as Kelton the Cop, comedy relief of two other Ed Wood films (&#8220;Plan 9&#8221; and &#8220;Night of the Ghouls.&#8221;)
Plan 9 From Outer Space &#8211; Voted by the Golden Turkey Awards as the worst movie ever made. Two minutes of old footage of a dead Bela Lugosi stars in this saga about aliens trying to take over the Earth with the help of an army of the dead (well, three dead people anyway.) Stars Tor Johnson, Paul Marco, Conrad Brooks, Vampira, Criswell, Gregory Walcott, Duke Moore, and Norma McCarty Wood.
All these films are razor sharp and clearer than they've been in many years. They all include a theatrical trailer, and &#8220;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#8221; includes a very worthwhile 2-hour documentary, &#8220;Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion.&#8221;",1047513600,3,1914,4.984375
7926395,5,B00004Y2QR,"Ed Wood's movies sure aren't ""bad"". As far as I'm concerned, the only way a movie can be bad is if it is neither intellectually stimulating or entertaining.  Sure, Ed Wood's films won't get you thinking, but when he set out to make his films his only goal was to entertain, and this is a goal he certainly accomplished.  Of course, just because something is not bad doesn't mean it is great either, but if you judge Ed Wood's films by their entertainment value, they are some of the best ever made.
Sure, some of the entertainment value of Wood's films comes from his inept direction, stilted dialogue, and obviously poor budgets, but despite this, his films have a great sense of sincerity and enthusiasm to them which make them endearing and contagious. When I watch a Wood film, I don't just laugh AT them (which is something I do), I also laugh WITH them. It is clear Wood is having fun and wants his audience to have fun as well.
And what a brave and daring filmmaker he was! Look at the subject matter of ""Glen or Glenda"", in which he so readily bared his soul about being a transvestite at the risk of public rejection and humiliation, especially considering the time period it was made! Also, at a time when any actor who was a little bit different was being blacklisted, Ed Wood was willing to cast a known drug addict (Bela Lugosi), homosexuals, and other misfits like Swedish wrestling star Tor Johnson.  Later directors like Fellini (who goes out of his way to cast unusual people) owe a great debt to Ed Wood.
And you don't get the sense that Wood's in it for the profit or glory, but instead that he is a genuinely nice guy who is in it for his own fun and because he cares about the audience.
And what imagination! Look for example at ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  You don't get the usual alien invasion story which was being rehashed over and over in 1950s sci-fi.  You also get zombies and vampires at a time they were rarely appearing in movies!  And instead of having the aliens unseen in their flying saucers, you get to meet them and learn something of their motivations.  He also creates a sympathetic zombie played by Bela Lugosi/Bela Lugosi's wife's chiropractor by showing how he died from grief over his wife's death.  No one-dimensional characters here!  And even in a movie like ""Glenn or Glenda"", which is about transvestism, he manages to get in footage of such things as  WWII Pacific warfare and Bela Lugosi playing the evil puppetmaster PULLING ""THE STRINGS!!"" of society, and making us dance like his mindless slaves!
My only quible with this collection is that they should have included ""Night of the Ghouls"" (the sequel to ""Bride of the Monster"") instead of ""Jail Bait"" (not one of his more entertaining -- its misleading title refers to a gun).  But if you enjoy ""Plan 9"", you should enjoy this box set.
Yes, it is sometimes fun to watch Wood's movies merely because they are so ""bad"". But as far as I'm concerned, Ed Wood's films deserve a place in the Criterion collection as some of the most entertaining movies ever made.",1024099200,14,3060,4.555555555555555
7926396,4,B00004Y2QR,"Here was a man who loved what he did.  He could have been the fellow from ""The Loved One"" who delighted in his job at the pet cemetary; he could have been the gardner who loved the blossoms; he may even have been a Louisiana governer grinning over his goats before the FBI called.  Ed was enamored of the movies' esthetic arts.  And I am enamored of the the Bardot of fifty years ago--neither has a grasp on the way things actually are.  In this set we find four of Ed's meisterwerk's: ""Glen or Glenda"" (I always thought the devil would be better dressed), ""Jailbait"" (the youngest member of the cast may be Lyle Talbot--I suspect false advertising), ""Bride of the Monster"" (c'mon--Loretta King resisted all liquids--why should we believe we should be killed by a sea creature?), and ""Plan 9"" (the aply named Dudley Manlove's line ""All you of earth are idiots"" suddenly seems a truism).  I cannot recommend this set for nitpickers or other such maniacs, but for those who crave a laugh: buy it.",1017100800,5,994,4.593220338983051
7926397,2,B00004Y2QR,"Just a quick note on Ed Wood. Someone said watching his movies is like that bad tv show you are suddenly watching, then find yourself changing the channel just to get away from it.

I rented ""Plan 9"", and I can stand just about any entertainment experience, but I kept falling asleep. I suggest you rent it first - then decide to buy or not.

Watching the movie ""Ed Wood"" is the reason I am even remotely considering this DVD collection (where else you gonna find a copy of ""Glen or Glenda""? If you really want an enjoyable movie rent or buy Ed Wood starring Johnny Depp with Sarah Jessica Parker. It is a drama that gives you insight into all of his movies and is a heck of a lot more entertaining - ""Ed Wood"" is the one to buy!

Perhaps they should rename the box set, ""Train Wreck: It's so horrible to see - but you can't turn away (no-doze included for a limited time)""",1008806400,,873,4.2155688622754495
7926398,3,B00004Y2QR,"Yes these film are dreadful, just like my home movies are. But like these films, I get enjoyment out of their crappyness. But is it a mystery to anyone that we can't get the Tim Burton film ""Ed Wood"" on dvd. I've been waiting for this masterpiece to arrive on this great format for years. What's going on? Can anyone tell me? Ed Wood couldn't make a good movie to save himself but Tim Burton made a wonderful film about him. So all I can say about these thought provoking classics is ""PULL THE STRINGS"". And to Tim Burton on the future release of ""Ed Wood"", GET ON WITH IT!!!",1005696000,3,575,4.236363636363636

ed wood's movies are exactly the same.  somehow their reputation exceeds them, but they are just boring and awful messes.  there's nothing funny or exciting about them.  it's like watching someone else's home movies.  please..",993513600,2,352,5.105263157894737
