2499507,5,B000E6ES9Y,"I Love This Cast!!!!!! I Grew Up Watching This Show And Loved Emily & Carol, Played By Such GREAT Actresses. I Can't Wait For Next Season!! So Many Wonderful Memories And So Much Laughter, I Love Not Having To Watch The Crud The Networks Put Out Now!!!",1146096000,5,252,4.382978723404255
2499508,3,B000E6ES9Y,"I realize I am going against conventional wisdom in that ""all old shows"" get 5 stars for nostaglia factor ""regardless"" however I have problems with Season Three and I call them as I sees them.

I really do not care for Bobs sister ""Ellen"" and she houses a fairly significant role in this Season. Her role just alters the chemistry between Bob & Emily, in fact the show seems altered when she is on the set and her persona bothers me. A bigger problem I have with this Season is the fact that too many of the stories either do not involve Bob or Emily or many do not further their characters. The past Seasons had Bob trying to come to grips with buying a house and the two thinking about kids, this season had none of that and too many scripts revolve around not so funny moments with irrelavent story lines. In short, the writing was less personalized and seemed more ""70's assembly line"" (Bob runs for office? Gah. Talk about out-of-idea-cliches!). The humor here in Season Three of Bob Newhart is also canned jokes that really only made me laugh a time or two. This is not to say I do not endorse buying the show, it is still a nice value, however in the world of Bob Newhart, IMO, this is the weak link so far.

The extras are welcomed and while sparse still OUTDUE all others for older shows like ALL in the Family which have none. And like All in the Family Season Four, I distinguish between good seasons and bad and do not just give them all five stars. There are bright moments though, when Bill Daily is trying to impress his son and make him like Ellen was quite good, but then again, it seemed more like a spin off since Bob and Emily were once again in the background.",1143763200,17,1681,4.299684542586751

2499567,5,B000E6ES9Y,"I remember watching this show as a little girl when my parents would watch the Saturday night line up of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Bob afterward and so forth..All good stuff I remember as a kid. When I grew up, thanks to TV land and Nick at Night I got to see all of these shows and they are incredibly great writing and so funny..The casting is perfect. I can't think of better people for each part all the way to Mr Carlin and his horrible attitude towards life..Bob is hilarious because he seems so calm all the time.. Emily seems like the perfect wife always wearing such stylish clothing and making Bob dinner w/of course Howard always included because Howard is unable to do anything for himself even though he seems to have a decent career and makes good money, yet he really relies on Bob and Emily for virtually everything.. I enjoy this show. I love it because it truly is funny. The writers from the Mary Tyler Moore show and Bob Newhart I think may have switched off here and there..They were both incredibly well written and still holds humor up to today 2016..I can't believe this show was in the 1970's. It just seems like yesterday. I love the first part of the show when Bob is walking all over Chicago and it shows the great shots of the beautiful architecture and buildings all around. A place that I have to go back to again. Plus it leads up to their lovely apartment overlooking a beach, I think it's Foster Beach and the apartment was decorated better when they had the blue couch and love seat set and the one I think is most attractive. It looks like a real grown ups aparment whereas apartments shown now a days have a lot of various things that make things look as if there are too many things in the apartments or homes or much too little and doesn't look like what I would say is a definite grown up apartment ..I say this because I remember in an episode in Sex and The City and Carrie was at her friends apartment late at night and when she was narrating the part when they entered the apartment, she stated ""Their apartment looked like a grown up apartment and I often wondered when I would have the same look for myself or would I always have that apartment that looked like a 16 year old lived there."" Something to that degree.and their, Bob and Emily's apartment is a grown up's apartment. ..I think it's done tastefully. The furniture to this day doesn't look so outdated like some other shows where you can immediately see that it's definitely another era and this has such good taste that it actually would look decent today... I love this show.. They had a complete 2 day weekend marathon that they ran and played every season i believe.. I remember when I was getting home for the day it was still playing from the time I had turned it on earlier that morning on a weekend.. That was fun and it brought back great memories of my childhood .. the childhood of a kid born in 1973... So funny and almost seems like yesterday..This show really is a classic comedy and Bob makes it work incredibly well..",1477785600,,3043,4.387610619469027

2499639,3,B000E6ES9Y,"For me, the show's originality was of course fading but the creativity was also suffering. Bob's character was still strong and so were most of the patients (especially Carlin). But overall, the ideas were just not strong enough for believable compelling episodes any more. Really hit and miss with Season 3, with about only 1 in 3 having the old charm and strength of the previous 2 seasons. Howard, who used to be lovable in a kindly endearing was had transformed into a bumbling rather annoying idiot. Bob's sister's presence didn't really add much to the show in way of humor or, well......anything  else either. Still enjoyable. Susan Plechette's presence is reason enough to watch, as she's not only gorgeous but extremely talented as well. A visibly strong presence. A woman of strength and character. If I had to do it again, I probably wouldn't have ordered this season. Or waited until I could have found it a bit cheaper.",1416700800,,932,4.825

2499691,3,B000E6ES9Y,"Seems that most long-running and successful sitcoms got it down by the third season. Yes, the *characters* have solidified, but strangely in this season, the writing seems, in too many cases, to be for *any* TV sitcom character.
Each episode has one or two classic lines, and there are some entertaining sight gags here and there. And, of course, Newhart's incredible one-two punch of delivery and reaction is a great feature, actually what drives the show.
Particularly curious are the roles of Hartley's sister and next-door-neighbor. ""Ellen"" is attractive and spirited but has little to do or say, and her fiance, ""Howard"", is impossibly eccentric. Sitcoms all seem to have a wacky neighbor down the hall, but this guy bounds into the Hartley living room to slow down the show and deliver silly soliloques. And to make it worse, he's given tight one-shots, instead of long shots which include Bob reading the newspaper, which changes the focus of the scene to Bob's reaction, not Howard's babbling.
Doctor Hartley's best foils were the staff at the office: the Dentist Jerry and the Receptionist Carol, always engaging. Indeed, one of the best moments in Season Three, and for my money, in TV history, is the scene in ""Life Is A Hamburger"", where Jerry and Carol passionately kiss when all other guests have left the engagement party. Carol's fiance, a wanna-be poet with nothing to say *or* write has departed, and the romantic move is mutual and real. Was it real, suppressed feeling coming to the surface because of the emotionality of the get-together, or a kind of relief that the door has been re-opened for some possible future occasion for them? The scene is quiet but the body language is impactful. Two fine actors.
The worst episode is ""Emily Hits The Ceiling"", where Emily is a summer camp planner and tries to enlist Bob as a Counselor. A bad premise, replete with foolish dialogue, including too much from Howard, in Native-American dress, providing all the stereotypical stuff you can imagine.
Runner-up is ""Vote Smartly - Think Hartley"": more uninspired writing and direction, in a bit about Bob being persuaded to run for Chairman of the local School Board because the incumbent has been a no-show.
Not to end this review on the downbeat, a very good show is ""Serve For Daylight"", about a charity Tennis Tournament with Bob trying to suppress his mad desire to win the trophy, then quickly losing it because wife nad tennis-partner Emily had tennis lessons which were...non-productive.
Interesting featurette with Bob Newhart around 2005, summing up the series. You might remark that he looks in shape to do another sitcom...but then realize that male-centered TV comedy is out.",1237507200,2,2698,4.984478935698448
2499692,3,B000E6ES9Y,"I am very disappointed that these disks have episodes on two sides, so you must flip the disk over to get the second half of the episodes. I much prefer a lot of episodes per disk, and only one side. Otherwise, the shows are great.",1191974400,5,231,4.155555555555556
2499693,5,B000E6ES9Y,"Why am I so addicted to this sitcom that aired more than 30 years ago?

Wonderful scripts, characters, storylines and players. Nuf said. May Newhart live on.",1178928000,,157,4.814814814814815
2499694,5,B000E6ES9Y,"This is one of my all-time favorite TV shows, but when I watched the first season I was a little disappointed.  It was still good, but not as funny as I remembered.  The second season was much funnier and by the third season they were clicking constantly.

The cast had really grown into their characters by this time, and nailed it time after time.  The writing was outstanding, and every one of these shows was funny.

The only negative thing I have to say is that if you're looking for extras these sets will disappoint you.  The only extra in this one was a 9 minute featurette, which was just Bob talking about the show.  It was interesting to hear, but there wasn't much of it.

I can't wait to see season four!",1177200000,,717,4.338345864661654
2499695,5,B000E6ES9Y,"The third season is three times the fun!  The series just keeps on getting better.

The Bob Newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television.  The other funny show was ""Newhart"", which I cannot understand why it has not been released on DVD.

The whole cast just clicks.  I wish shows like this were still on television.

If you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets!",1174608000,,393,4.315068493150685
2499696,5,B000E6ES9Y,"Like the MTM show, Newhart has a style of humor that's timeless, and this show seemed to get better with each passing season.",1174089600,,125,4.478260869565218

I love the show and when Amazon has a TV DVD sale you can get this at a great price  but even off sale to get 25 or more shows for about a dollar a show  its a great deal

I Now have the first three seasons and will buy them all eventually

Hope you enjoy",1173398400,,463,3.4411764705882355
2499698,5,B000E6ES9Y,"No one is a better straight man to a group of crazies than Bob Newhart. And group it is. One episode brings two battling counseling groups together on a retreat. Emily is perfect. I wouldn't want to fly in an aircraft navigated by Howard, as Bob and Emily do. Jerry and Carol are great subject for humor at the office. Don't miss Tommy the Tooth. And all those patience make me feel normal. Season three makes me look forward to season four.",1169164800,,441,4.390243902439025

Bob is known for his dry sense of humor, and with a cast of great comedic actors,this is a DVD you will want in your collection.

2499701,5,B000E6ES9Y,"We hadn't seen this show in awhile, and had forgotten just how funny it was!  This show is a classic, and we have really enjoyed watching it, and plan to get the other seasons also.  The humor used was intelligent, not potty-mouthed like shows resort to today.  It's also fun to re-live the 70's through the sometimes-wacky clothing worn by the characters!  Check out Bob's plaid pants!  Check out Carol's farout patterns and colors!  Lots of fun! You won't regret buying this!",1167782400,,477,4.7560975609756095
2499702,5,B000E6ES9Y,"This may be one of the funniest shows ever, so I'm thrilled to be able to get good copies to watch.  They're pretty simple, not a lot of whippy ""extras"" except for a couple of commentaries which, if you are not really familiar with Bob Newhart's comedy or have never seen him interviewed, you might find boring, because he's pretty laid back.  But I found them hilarious and was glad to be able to listen to them.  I think the transfer is good and it looks like they included all the minutes that might have been removed for syndication.",1165276800,,537,4.404040404040404
2499703,5,B000E6ES9Y,"I have seasons 1 and 2, both very good, but I think season three was the best. If you like Bob Newhart 1 and 2, you'll definitely like season 3.",1155945600,2,144,3.8333333333333335
2499704,5,B000E6ES9Y,When you order - and you should- check to make sure that all eight epsiodes are present on the first disk.  On ours there were only the first four.  We received this third season hot off the press so they may have corrected the problem.,1155340800,3,236,4.222222222222222
2499705,5,B000E6ES9Y,"I have always been a Newhart fan. I had forgotten how hilarious the many one liners were. They are just as good as they were when his series first came out. The characters are terrific and

well developed.",1154736000,2,205,4.394736842105263
2499706,4,B000E6ES9Y,"The third season (1974-1975) of ""The Bob Newhart Show"" for me is not quite as good as the second season.  To be sure, there are many very funny episodes, but there is one area where it seems to come up short and that is the lack of appearances by the main group of patients.  In fact, Mrs. Bakerman (Florida Friebus) doesn't appear at all during the season, and for the only appearance of Mr. Gianelli he is played by Daniel J. Travanti (later of Hill Street Blues) instead of by Noam Pitlik who played him in the previous seasons.  In addition, John Fiedler makes only one appearance as Mr. Peterson during the season.

That is not to say that there are no Group appearances, because they do experiment with some new groups such as an all woman's group, and an elderly group (including Mr. Carlin), and they even have Bob as a patient in a group (again including Mr. Carlin).  They also develop some new or previously rarely seen patients such as Mr. Herd (Oliver Clark), Mr. Plager (Howard Hesseman), Mrs. Loomis (Merie Earle), and the very funny Mr. Vickers (Lucian Scott).  Ellen Hartley (Pat Finley) also becomes a fairly regular member of the cast.

In season two there were many guest stars which went on to make names for themselves, and there are a few this year as well but not as many and for the most part they are not as well known as those in season two.  John Ritter is great as Dave, a server at an ice cream shop.  Edward Winter plays an ambitious executive at an insurance company.  Fred Willard plays Ellen's ex-fianc&eacute; John Tobin.  Also, Bob's real-life father-in-law Bill Quinn makes a couple of appearances as Eddie the Mailman.

There are many very funny episodes this season as well.  In ""The Battle of the Groups"" Bob is talked into taking two of his groups on a marathon session.  ""The Great Timpau Medical Co-op Experiment"" is another wonderful episode in which Bob's fellow doctors form a co-op where they treat each other for free.  The doctors also play a big role in ""Serve for Daylight"" where they compete in a mixed-doubles tennis tournament.  Bob gives up his private practice to become a staff psychologist at Loggers Casualty Insurance Company in ""The Gray Flannel Shrink"".  Emily helps to organize a children's summer camp in ""Emily Hits the Ceiling"".  There are many more as well.

All 24 episodes are included on three 2-sided DVDs as was the case with the first two seasons.  Like the second season, there are five episodes with commentary, and there is a featurette for the season on the third disk.  Once again the commentaries are not very engaging, and this is probably true because Bob's talking style is very drawn out and he is known for great reactions which cannot be captured on an audio commentary effectively.  Bob is on all the commentaries and there are two with Peter Bonerz who plays Dr. Jerry Robinson; one with Fred Willard; one with director Jim Burrows; and Bob does one by himself.  The one with Jim Burrows is my favorite, as he talks about his early directing experiences and where he messed up when filming the episode.",1153440000,16,3089,4.648250460405157

2499709,5,B000E6ES9Y,"For the past thirty or so years I've remembered the classic ice cream restaurant spoof where Bob tries not to attract the attention of the obnoxious waiters and ends up being celebrated as a ""single scooper party pooper"".  This was likely a spoof of the Farrell's chain of ice cream restaurants that hit their peak of popularity just about the time of this season of Bob Newhart.

That was the single funniest sit-com moment of my pre-teen years and I wondered if I would ever see it again.  I did research to find out what season this episode is in, and it turned out to be this season so I bought it.

I had a great time watching that episode, but the others are good too.  I like a sit com with great chemistry and subtle humor (not many of those around these days) and this one delivers.  Now that I'm a grown-up, it's even funnier.",1151884800,4,836,4.326923076923077

Aside from the great acting one thing that makes this program work is that they pick on problems that one could actually face and show how absurd one can get before coming back to earth. There is everything from job loss to weight gain.

On this set of DVDs there are some commentaries; the commentaries are not as well thought put as they could have been, however they do add a dimension to the episodes. I hope they still keep going with the series.

We did learn that somewhere out there is a pilot of Peter Bonerz whom plays Dr. Jerry Robinson plays a more advances psychologist instead of a dentist. This would make a great extra.

But I don't understand why only a few seasons of some TV series are available on Prime streaming video. _The Bob Newhart Show_ is an excellent example.
