8342174,1,B001TOE84K,"So I really wanted to like this. I really did. I'm from Maine, the midcoast area in fact. We are stationed in Guam (Husband is Navy) and a friend off the ship bought this movie and let us borrow it. I figured it might be pretty funny and if not, i'd at least maybe recognize some places or people, being from the area.

Yeaaaaaaaaah..the entire thing is filmed in either an inside room or on a street corner. You see nothing else. And I get subtle humour, but this just fell flat. The acting was really horrible. The blonde store owner I thought was the only one that was somewhat beleivable. I get that this is low budget humoir..but Subtle humour only works if the people at least pretend to act. This entire thing was so monotone..",1244160000,,734,4.357664233576642
8342175,1,B001TOE84K,CSI Maine is obviously comedy which is so subtly nuanced that it avoids humour by a wide margin.,1239926400,,96,4.388888888888889
8342176,5,B001TOE84K,"This movie is witty and on point throughout.  Very funny spoof on CSI Miami, one of the most over acted and over dramatic shows on TV.  CSI Maine will make you laugh from beginning to end.  Brilliantly written and finely acted (for the most part :-) ).  You MUST see this movie - especially if you are from Maine or know people in Maine.",1237766400,,337,4.21875
