8341284,4,B001TH37OO,"Let's talk, I have 50 or more World War II DVD's! That's true and several have the same government filmed film repeated. This 5 Disk, 570 min, wonderfully packaged product (Great Tin, Pamphlet of ""The Great Aces of WWII"" 14 pgs, 5 Disks held in a high-quality Book type container ( no cheap black envelopes) and can be independent of the tin, is great! How many WWII DVDS show the Curtis P-40 instrument panel? That shows flap angle gauge in action? That shows the instrument cluster of landing gear up/down ""as its working?"" I can't hear you? This product has WWII VIDEO that is not on any of my 50+ DVDS! This is under $20 bucks and yes it does have repeated scenes, but sometimes that's just the way it is, because their is only so much film of WWII. I hate re-enacements, Echo Bridge ( who supplied the film) has one of the best archives of WWII film. Show me the real deal over enactments as often as you need, narration is OK, great Value, I say, ""buy"". I did.",1382572800,2,966,4.342541436464089
8341285,1,B001TH37OO,"The title of this set really has very little to do with the content.  You would expect featurettes on the history of specific aircraft, but there are very few and not very informative.  Of the few times they do focus on an aircraft, many of the visuals are not even of that aircraft.  Only a couple of them do visually remain on subject, but the information isn't even in context.  As another reviewer mentioned, most of the time the information being read by the narrator has nothing to do with the video.  There is too much footage of aircraft, people, or events that have nothing to do with the narration.  To make that worse, while the overall subject is supposed to be about aircraft, most of the time it seems that the narrator is reading from an ultimately boring history textbook about specific incidents and events of WWII.  For example, on the disc dedicated to Japanese aircraft, a great deal of time is spent reciting the history of Pacific naval campaigns concerning ship battles, right down to the minutes that a bomb hit a ship or the crew abandoned ship.  I am a history student with an interest in military history, and it just seems that the producers of this DVD set not only had no clue as to the subject they were supposed to present, but went completely wild with some video archive and just threw images together that have nothing to do with the subject of the narration.  As a matter of fact, quite often the narration changes subject, and then returns to describing the previous subject.  If I were a history professor at (pardon me) even a small community college, I would give this presentation an F for inability to stay on subject matter, lack of completeness, and failure to communicate effectively.  I seriously cannot recommend this DVD set to anyone and wish that I had not purchased it.  I think I'll just donate this to Goodwill, and in the future I will make sure that I remember the production company that created this and make sure I don't buy any of their products again.",1365292800,,2011,4.58659217877095
8341286,1,B001TH37OO,"The thing is packaged so beautifully, but the actual contents seem so cheap.  The narrator is dull.  The score is irritating.  Most of the time, the narration has nothing to do with the visuals.  It's like trying to listen to a discussion on the solar system while watching a video about the process of photosynthesis.  And they just keep looping the same footage over and over again.  In one particularly distracting part, they were discussing some tactical fighting by the Germans, while showing footage of factory workers.  It literally made no sense.  You'd be better off just watching the History Channel or the Military Channel.",1267920000,10,634,4.9714285714285715
8341287,1,B001TH37OO,"I got this for Christmas and so had high hopes, which were crushed. The editing of the commentary and the footage shown have a tenuous link at best, and the same footage is shown again and again with no obvious linkage with the commentary. The same bombs dropping and ground attack sequences are used for the Polish campaign, the French campaign and Russia. The commentary will commonly be describing one plane while showing footage of another, so trying to match the plane up with what is being said is more or less impossible. The Bf109 is being described as a squadron of FW190's zooms by. You can keep this straight if you know your planes, but I still cannot tell my Mig-3 from my LaGG-5 in the Russian sequence. Shots of Ju88's are shown as the commentator rambles on about the Me110. It ends up being frustrating beyond belief, and shows a lack of care, understanding or good documentary craftsmanship. The section on the Me262 shows at various times, the version with bicycle and tricycle undercarriage at random with no logical connection, or explanation of the evolution from one to the other. The inaccuracies and lack of intelligent information wears you out. The commentary will throw in oddly useless esoteric technical facts like when particular versions of planes were brought out.  On and on it goes. My favorite faux-pas is that for the Me262 due to the unreliable BMW turboprop engines, it first took to the air propelled by a ""Jumbo"" engine. Lord help us! Don't waste your money.",1261958400,8,1499,4.787644787644788
