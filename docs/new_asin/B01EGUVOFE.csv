8758718,5,B01EGUVOFE,"I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD.  It covers a lot of areas and situations of Germans trying to reach the Reich at the outbreak of war.  One of my favorite German actors, Carl Raddatz is in it, which certainly helps--but the DVD is entertaining throughout.  I'm not surprised that it grossed well at the time of its release.  Well worth the money!",1484438400,,343,4.573770491803279
