8241439,5,189390752X,"If you are a beginner and interested in blues style playing, this is a good companion series with a beginner guitar book.  With a few skills such as scales, hammer-on and lifts, you can start this book and work simultaneously with a book like 'Electric Guitar Primer"" by Bert Casey.

Keep in mind that this series of books and companion videos are at an extreme ""beginner"" level  If you have never played an instrument before, you should be able to move from beginning to end to get kicked off into playing.  If you have played any instrument prior (I am a sax and piano player), you can skim over the intro to music theory chapters and start the exercises.

If there there is a better series out there, I would love to hear about them however, I think this one is very effective in getting started.  Just remember to set aside time each day to practice, practice, practice.  The secret to this video and companion book (make sure to get the book also) is to get a good grasp of each concept before proceeding to the next subject.",1412035200,,1030,4.446808510638298
