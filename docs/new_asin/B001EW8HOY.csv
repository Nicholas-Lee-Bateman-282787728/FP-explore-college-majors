3557686,3,B001EW8HOY,"For more than a dozen years Errol Flynn was one of Hollywood's brightest stars, both on and off the screen. But here in 1950 his  best days were behind him - Captain Blood (1935), Major Vickers (1936), Robin Hood (1938), the Earl of Essex (1939), and George Armstrong Custer (1941) - were done and gone. And while he did have a few good films left in him (""Roots of Heaven"", ""The Sun Also Rises"", ""Too Much Too Soon""), his work in the mid 40s through the mid 50s was pretty mediocre.

In this film Flynn plays a Confederate Captain sent to California to stir up trouble. He's accompanied by a motley crew that includes Slim Pickens, Big Boy Williams, Sheb Wooley, and Chubby Johnson, and his love interest is his future wife, Patrice Wymore, in her film debut.

Slim Pickens (1919-1983) is best remembered for his role as the cowboy who rides a nuclear bomb in ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1941), but I remember him best in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973) as the aging Sheriff Baker who is gut shot and sitting by the river with his wife Katy Jurado as Bob Dylan sings ""Knocking on Heaven's Door.""

""Big Boy"" Williams (1899-1962) stuck out in more than 200 films, often as a comic sidekick in films like ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940) ""The Alamo"" (1960), and ""The Comancheros"" (1961). He transitioned to TV in the 50s appearing in ""My Friend Flicka"" (1955-6) and more notably in ""Circus Boy"" (1956-7).

Chubby Johnson (1903-74) made a career out of being the affable sidekick in western films and then TV.

Sheb Wooley (1921-2003) is best known for his roles as a villain in films like ""High Noon"" (Ben Miller) and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (Travis Cobb), but his greatest popularity came as scout Pete Nolan in TV's ""Rawhide"".

Although it's great to see these well-known character actors, the truth is that they don't really give us the depth of work they are capable of.

This was the third of four films for director William Keighley (1889-1984) who worked with Flynn on ""The Prince and the Pauper"" (1937) and ""Robin Hood"" (1938). Although he never won any major awards, Keighley directed such memorable films as ""The Man who came to Dinner"" (1942), ""G Men"" (1935), and ""The Green Pastures"" (1936).

Keighley keeps the action moving, but it tends to get claustrophobic, and we get a little too much of Flynn (and I am a big fan).

The NY Times called it a ""lofty display of hot heroics on the ringing Western plains"" and praised ""the drawling ragamuffins who loyally surround Mr. Flynn.""

1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for ""All About Eve"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), ""Cyrano"" (Actor) and ""Born yesterday"" (Actress).  The top grossers included ""Cinderella"", ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Glass Menagerie"", ""Rashomon"", ""The Third Man"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High"".
Westerns were popular with films like ""Ambush"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""The Gunfighter"" and ""Winchester 73"".

Bottom line - a pretty ordinary Western with a good supporting cast. But you'd need to be a big Errol Flynn fan to really appreciate it.",1343088000,4,3173,4.798165137614679
3557687,5,B001EW8HOY,"This movie is surprisingly good.  It is sort of a War Between the States meets Wild West type of film.  The plot centers around eight Confederates who have been sent on a mission by  General Lee to try and drum up support out in California.  They are to meet en envoy out there and when they do, unbeknownst to them he pretends to be somebody else.  After witnessing a stage get ransacked by the Indians they find a lady inside who was traveling to meet her fiance.  This turns out to be an albatross around their neck as her fiance is a Yankee soldier portrayed by future ""The Adventures of Jim Bowie"" star, Scott Forbes.  In an ironic twist of fate, the yankees end up trying to help out the Confederates at the end.  And we are treated in the meantime to darling little vignettes of the young 16 year-old Buck Wheat who carries his dog with him.  At times during the night scenes, the black and white scenes get really dark.  Errol Flynn is also reaching the stage where his looks are fading.  But none of this detracts from the film's ability to simply draw one in to the dilemma that the Confederates are facing.",1337040000,2,1117,4.37378640776699
3557688,5,B001EW8HOY,"A very underated Flynn film. March 1865,Errol is a Confederate Captain on a mission from Gen Robert E Lee to organize the Confederate underground in the West and control it for the South.
The key is outlaw leader Cole Smith(Howard Petrie)a sacastic,unfeeling hoodlum who Errol and his small unit of Confederate soildiers have little repect for.
They save two passangers,(Patrice Wymore and Chubby Johnson)from an indian attack.
Soon Union Officer(Scott Forbes)whos engaged to Patrice come looking for her and he too is captured by the Confederates.
Trouble brews when the warlike indian tribe attack the mountain where the soildiers are hiding waiting for Cole Smiths men.
Patrice Wymore soon became MRS Flynn.
Sheb Wooley,local on Rawhide had a big 1950s record with The Purple People Eater .This was his First film.(Only time he worked with Flynn).
Errols final Western and last performance with pal,constant sidekick,and later pallbearer,Guinn Big Boy Williams.",1323907200,3,964,5.433333333333334
3557689,2,B001EW8HOY,"I have been a fan of Errol Flynn since very young, but I must say that I am disappointed with this one. Flynn looks old and haggard, with no trace of the brilliance and charm of bygone days.
Perhaps one cannot expect the same qualities in any star that has grown old, perhaps except Gary Cooper, who still retained a lot of his qualities even in his last western "" The Hanging Tree "".
But as an old fan, this film must be watched anyway.",1270252800,3,437,4.152941176470589
3557690,3,B001EW8HOY,"There were indeed the Panamint Shoshone in eastern California in the desert,
but the drums in the movie are very unlike real Shoshone music.
Historically the Shoshone raided Wells Fargo Pony express
and stage coaches in the 1860's that came into California.
The real Confederate move in the west was one involving Confederate troops
from  Texas, but the story is a good one about yet another
Confederate failure. It seems strange that in the middle
of a civil war you have a three sided conflict?
The other material on the DVD are three good short movies
about historical California and a comedy show at the end.
I have seen several others of the digitized early westerns
on DVD and this is better than some of them.",1255046400,8,716,4.682539682539683
3557691,4,B001EW8HOY,"'Rocky Mountain' is Errol Flynn's last big screen western, probably had the smallest budget of any of his westerns, but arguably, could be his best!
Still handsome at 40, just before the decline set in, Flynn is a born leader, and a tough one when called for, their mission is futile, they know it, but duty means they must press on regardless, in the end it's a case of, can they save anyone from the maurading indians, closing in all around them? Featuring some magnificent scenery in New Mexico, it could have benefited by color, but apart from that, this is one fine western, with a surprise ending, that makes it all that more real!",1248480000,8,637,4.547826086956522
3557692,4,B001EW8HOY,"This is a great Western movie. I saw it 30 years ago on late night T.V. and I've been looking for it ever since.
I guess they've re-issued it on DVD. It ain't no ""Lonesome Dove"", but it's pretty good.",1239753600,3,200,4.025
3557693,4,B001EW8HOY,"THe previous reviewer did a great job reviewing this film.  I would only add that Flynn is not as energetic as he could be because of his personal lifestyle.  I think that shows in all his later films.

Having said that, the ending was NOT what I expected and actually brought a tear to my eye.  IMO, the ending makes the movie.  Enjoy!",1235174400,5,336,4.26984126984127

8299714,5,B001EW8HOY,"I'm giving this one five stars. I bought it in a boxed set of Flynn westerns. This one was made in 1950 and one look at Flynn and you just knew that his days as a huge box office draw were rapidly coming to an end because of his boozing life style. A sad thing indeed. It was shot in black and white. Probably because the studio knew that it was over for Flynn and quite possibly because black and white somewhat would hide the fact that he was falling apart. All of that being said, I think that Rocky Mountain is a great western and I'm very glad that its part of my library.",1433462400,,577,4.026086956521739

8299718,5,B001EW8HOY,"I don't normally review movies but this one has stayed with me since I was a child.  SPOILER ALERT: The final scene where the small band of confederates charge into the mass of Indians made a lifelong impression on me.  It was a long time between viewings and all I could remember was the name, Rocky Mountain.  When I recently looked it up online I was able to purchase and watch it again after perhaps 60 years.  It was Errol Flynn's last western.  The story, plot, acting and scenery were all just fine.  Nothing extraordinary for a black and white film, but just fine.  It was the final charge that made this movie so memorable and gripped an impressionable young child.  I'm glad to have seen it once (or more times) again!
