But his other CD's are profanity free, making them family friendly. Some might say, who cares? But I do. I wish comics would be rated like movies so the consumer would know what to expect.
Bottome line: Very funny, very John Heffron, but unlike his other work, not for children.
BTW, if you are looking for something you can laugh to with your kids, try John's older work, Brian Regan, or Jim Gaffigan's newer DVD's (his older one's contain the F word).",1266192000,2,609,4.527272727272727
3881415,5,B0029W2V9K,"I had the pleasure of knowing and working with John back in 1989 at the Main Street Comedy Showcase in Ann Arbor, MI when he was just starting out.  At the time, I was one of the door hosts and a regular on the open mic nights where I got to see John perform over and over and over.  I had his material memorized and wish he'd bring some of it out on future shows (i.e. his mom buying a butter churn at a yard sale, his bit about the barber ""nicking"" your ear and the blanket around your neck so tight to cut off the bleeding, para-sailing and hitting bridges, etc.)

Anyhow, back in '89 I remember thinking to myself, ""This guy is good...he's going to make it big in the comedy circuit.""  He was still in college and was funnier and more comfortable on stage than the headliners he was opening for.  I'm glad to see he's making it. His style of comedy is so down to earth and it's something we all can relate to.  The material is constantly updated and a reflection of where he is in his life at the time.  I'm sure if/when he gets divorced he'll have tons of new funny material to reflect on.  John has a talent for finding the funny side of basic things in life.  I was really surprised to see him on the Gene Simmons comedy roast...I guess if you're invited to that, you're on your way.

I give this this DVD 5 stars becuase it's one you enjoy over and over.  His reflection on things we all grew up on will take you back and make you laugh (I loved the bit on cassette tapes!)

BTW, when he won Last Comic Standing, wasn't one of the prized an NBC contract?  Whatever happened with that?",1250035200,6,1592,4.14657980456026
3881436,5,B0029W2V9K,"John Heffron displays his same comical disposition as he did in Last Comic Standing. If you liked his material from LCS, then I'm sure you'll like this stand up. His material is a little bit more raunchy than LCS, but it's still palatable for those who can't stomach comics as vulgar like Louis CK or Daniel Tosh. He's not family friendly like Jeff Foxworthy or Steve Harvey, but he's definitely hovering just outside of that perimeter.",1435449600,,436,4.75
