3610893,5,B001GF8WU8,My kids really enjoy this show and the fact that they can watch it whenever they want is great instead of waiting for it to show on TV. Its a good fun series that we all enjoy watching together.,1239235200,,194,4.0
3610894,3,B001GF8WU8,Unable to view this DVD on Australian players. I had previously purchased region 1 DVD's from Amazon so not sure why this did not work. Able to watch on Notebook.,1236556800,,162,4.433333333333334
3610895,5,B001GF8WU8,My boys watched this movie from the time they walked in the door till dinner time to bed time. They have been at this movie for the 1st 2 wks heavy now they are back to the ben 10 cartoons,1236124800,,188,3.725
3610896,4,B001GF8WU8,"Ben, Gwen, and even Kevin are back on a new DVD with more adventures of the first season.  Four more episodes has our heroes searching for Grandpa Max as well as fighting off as many enemies as they can.  It's no problem to them with Gwen and Kevin's awesome superpowers as well as Ben's Omnitrix that lets him change into new creatures like the web-spinning primate Spidermonkey and the harder-than-rock Chromastone.

Other episodes include Ben's first date with a girl he likes and Gwen learning about her origins.  Also on this DVD is a feature called ""DNA of a Scene"" where you get a inside look on the making of this series.

Knowing that this is Season One, Volume Two, the final volume of the first season will be arriving real soon.  And don't forget to check out brand-new episodes on Friday nights under the somewhat ominous phrase ""You Are Here"".",1236038400,2,857,4.642384105960265
3610897,5,B001GF8WU8,This was purchased for my grandson so I can not personally review it.  But he appears to be happy with it and is anticipating Season Two.,1235260800,,137,4.269230769230769
3610898,5,B001GF8WU8,Definitely a winner for Ben 10 fans.  Like the way the characters grew up. Only wish season was sold as a box set instead of individual volumes. I'd be ticked if a more affordable box set packaging came out later. Overall a good purchase.,1234051200,,238,4.409090909090909
3610899,5,B001GF8WU8,"Season One Volume 2 starts out with Grampa Max. As we all know it was his disappearance that led to Ben using the Omnitrix again and starting them on their adventure. So, where is Max and what has he been up to? Well, we soon find out. The second episode finds Ben getting a date with a girl named Julie. Yet, like all dates, it gets ruined when an alien shows up and starts wreaking havoc. The third finds Gwen and Ben getting reunited with their long-lost Gramma. Through her, Gwen finds out alot about where her magic-wielding powers come from. And, lastly, School Bullies Cash and JT make an appearance and steal some alien technolgy & it is left up to Ben to save the day. The only extra is ""DNA of a Scene"" a short featurette that recreates a scene with original script notes, storyboards & the finished product.

While I love Ben 10 Alien Force and recommend you get this if you've got the extra money, my gripes still ring on. It is beyond me why Cartoon Network & Warner Home Video would put so many episodes of a season onto DVD when we're in the midst of Season 2 now on TV. Besides, the episodes appear to be out of order on the DVD as they originally aired on TV. It's a real disappoinment to me and other Ben 10 Alien Force fans, I'm sure, as well. If it were any other series, I don't know if I'd recommend you buy the episodes. However, considering that it is Ben 10 Alien Force and the show keeps you engrossed throughout, I have to recommend it.

Season 1 Volume 3 won't be out for a couple of months. Look back here later on for another review from me. Let's hope that Cartoon Network and Warner Home Video wise up and give us the whole season on DVD at some point. This is ridiculous.",1232150400,2,1704,4.24
