2067329,4,B00028G6RQ,"WWE Survivor Series Opener:

WWE Survivor Series opened up with a video hyping tonight's matches, and also interestingly showed clips of Bret Hart spitting on Vince McMahon from 1997 in the intro. Tonight dreams will flourish, and some will come to an untimely end. Tonight, only the strong will SURVIVE. The fireworks then went off in the arena and we are live in the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Michael Cole and Tazz welcomed us to the show and we then go over to Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler and then the Spanish Commentators, Hugo Savinovich and Carlos Cabrera.

1st match: Spike Dudley (c) vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio for the Cruiserweight Championship:

The finish:

Chavo is back inside and Chavo scored with the Gory Bomb on Spike and made the cover, but Kidman came off the top with a leg drop to break the count. Mysterio then sent Kidman to the outside with a huricanrana, and Mysterio was also taken over with the momentum. Spike then crawled over to Chavo and made the cover to retain his championship!

Winner via Pinfall: Spike Dudley

Rating: 7/10

Backstage:

Heidenreich is backstage with Heyman and Heidenreich said that the Undertaker is going down tonight! Heyman went to get the straightjacket and then Gene Snitsky came in and the two got nose to nose, and Snitsky said he liked his poetry and Heidenreich said he liked what he did to babies! Snitsky said he would see him later and Heidenreich said he would see him soon!

2nd match: Shelton Benjamin (c) vs. Christian for the Intercontinental Championship:

The finish:

Tyson slide the title belt into the ring and then distracted the referee. Christian went to hit Shelton, but Shelton kicked it into the face of Christian. Christian and the referee got into a tug of war over the belt and then Shelton came off the top with a clothesline for two. The referee disposed of the belt, but Tomko came inside and knocked Shelton down and then Christian covered for two. Shelton then hit Tyson off the apron with a wicked Dragon whip and then Christian went for the Unprettier, but Shelton reversed into his Exploder Suplex and made the cover for the win! Good match!

Winner via Pinfall: Shelton Benjamin

Rating: 7/10

Backstage:

Kurt Angle was shown backstage and then came across Edge. Kurt said he read Edge's book and he said he didn't appreciate what Edge said about him. Kurt asked how it felt for the fans to pick Shawn Michaels over him. Edge said that he will get his title shot after he wins tonight. Edge said after Taboo Tuesday he took Michaels out, something Kurt has never done. Eugene then bumped into Kurt and spouted off the Kurt'saccomplishments before starting a You Suck chant!

3rd match: John Cena, The Big Show, Rob Van Dam and Eddie Guerrero vs. Carlito Carribbean Cool, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak and Kurt Angle in an Elimination Match:

The finish:

Angle began to leave, but RVD came into the aisle and backed Angle back to the ring. Big Show came behind Kurt and Kurt walked right into him. Kurt went for a right, but Big Show hit a knee to the gut and then sent Angle inside, allowing Cena to hit the FU on Kurt Angle. Eddie Guerrero then went up top and came off with the Frog Splash on Angle. Big Show crawled back into the ring and made the cover, and this one is over!

Survivors: John Cena, Eddie Guerrero and The Big Show

Rating: 8/10

Backstage:

The Coach is backstage with Maven and Coach said that Maven doesn't deserve to be in the match. Maven cut him off and Maven said he was going to give Coach a personal demonstration of why he deserves it. Snitsky then attacked Maven from behind and brutally went to work on Maven and Snitsky is a mad man. Maven is busted open pretty bad as some agents helped him up to his feet.

4th match: The Undertaker vs. Heidenreich:

The finish:

The Undertaker whipped Heidenreich, but Heidenreich reversed and locked in a sleeper, but the Undertaker back suplexed out of it. Both men are down and the referee reached an eight count but Taker sat up. Taker hit a flying clothesline on Heidenreich and called for another chokeslam. Taker grabbed him by the throat and scored with the chokeslam. The Undertaker then signalled for the Tombstone and picked up Heidenreich and hit the Tombstone. The Undertaker then covered for the victory!

Winner via Pinfall: The Undertaker

Rating: 8/10

Backstage:

Maria was backstage with Eric Bischoff and asked for an update on Maven. Eric said it appears as if Maven will not be able to compete tonight. She then asked if there will be a replacement. Eric said he is hours away from taking his first vacation in years. If he named a replacement, Triple H and his team would protest and instead of being on a beach, he would be round a table with a board of directors. No one is going to replace Maven, and that is final.

5th match: Trish Stratus (c)vs. Lita for the Women's Championship:

Lita got in the ring and gave Trish a straight right. Lita then went to work on Trish with some more right hands and then a slap. Lita gave Trish some more rights in the corner and then took her down to the mat and mounted her with more punches, sending Trish to the outside. Trish fought back and sent Lita head first into the announce table, but then Lita sent Trish face first into a chair. Lita grabbed a steel chair and hammered away at Trish and the referee has called for the bell.

Winner: No Contest

Rating: 2/10

The Aftermath:

Trish is busted open and Lita locked in a rear naked choke on Lita and Lita has snapped here at the Survivor Series. Trish's nose looks to be broken and she is in a lot of pain and then Lita attacked Trish from behind, sending her into the steel steps. The fans chanted for Lita and Trish was helped to the back

Backstage:

Backstage, Eddie and Big Show were with John Cena. Theodore Long walked in and thanked them for an outstanding match. Long said he wanted to talk to Cena. Long congratulated Cena on a speedy recovery and said it was good to have him back. Cena said Carlito just walked out like nothing happened tonight. Long said that won't be the case this Thursday. He is ordering Carlito to appear on Smackdown! this week, and he will be defending the United States Championship, and if he doesn't show up, he will strip him of the title. Long said Carlito will go one on one with John Cena this Thursday, Holla.

6th match: John Bradshaw Layfield (c) vs. Booker T for the WWE Championship:

The finish:

JBL went for the Clothesline from Hell, but Booker hit a super kick and then knocked Orlando off the apron. Booker then hit the Scissors Kick on JBL and made the cover and another referee ran down and got to two before Orlando pulled him out. Jordan came inside with the belt but was given the Book End. JBL then hit Booker with the title and made the cover just as the referee was coming around and got the three count.

Winner via Pinfall: John Bradshaw Layfield

Rating: 8/10

WWE In Iraq:

Footage was shown of last year when WWE went out to visit the troops in Iraq, and announced they are heading back there for this upcoming Holiday Season.

Backstage:

Evolution were shown backstage, and Batista said Snitsky and Edge want the World Title. Triple H said after tonight, Evolution are going to run RAW for the next two weeks, and Snitsky and Edge will not be able to challenge for anything. Batista then stopped Flair, and told him he can't wait for his week to run RAW.

Main Event: Edge, Gene Snitsky, Batista and Triple H vs. Maven, Chris Jericho, Randy Orton and Chris Benoit in a Control of RAW Elimination Match:

The finish:

Edge almost went into Triple H, and then Orton dropkicked Edge, sending Triple H off the apron and rolled up Edge for a bear fall. Triple H then came inside and hit a big spinebuster on Orton. Triple H held Orton up and Edge went for the Spear, but Orton moved and Edge speared the Game, and then Orton hit the RKO on Edge and pinned him, and Edge is out of there! It's down to Randy Orton and Triple H. Orton stared down Triple H but the referee was distracted with Edge. Orton went for the RKO, but Triple H hit a low blow on Orton. Triple H went for the Pedigree but Orton span around and hit the RKO out of nowhere and Orton has won it!

Survivor: Randy Orton

Rating: 10/10

The Aftermath:

Randy Orton celebrated his victory over the World Heavyweight Champion and he is the sole survivor here tonight. Orton then looked down at Triple H on the outside and mounted off at him.  Survivor Series then went off the air with Orton's hand held in victory.

2067330,4,B00028G6RQ,"I really didn't think I was going to enjoy this PPV very much, but it actually turned out to be my favorite PPV of 2004!  How's that for a shocker?  Here's the scoop...

Cruiserweight Championship
Rey Mysterio vs. Billy Kidman vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Spike Dudley (champion)
---An energizing crowd-pleaser.  Basically, the action never stops, which is exactly what you expect from the WWE's Cruiserweight division.  I usually don't care for Spike Dudley, but he did some good work here.  In fact, all four men delivered a fast-paced opener that any kind of fan will like.
""8.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Intercontinental Championship
Christian vs. Shelton Benjamin (champion)
---I love Shelton Benjamin; he's a phenomenal athlete and if used right could go onto great things.  I really hope he makes it big in his career.  Christian is up to his usual heel tricks, and almost always delivers good IC Title matches.  This is more of a methodically-paced match instead of a faster-paced type you might expect from either man.  But, it's slow in a way that keeps your attention.  A worthy entry in the card.
""7.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Survivor Series Match
Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak, & Carlito vs.
Big Show, Rob Van Dam, Eddie Guerrero, & John Cena
---Some may frown at Carlito's early departure.  While I hated the Cena/Carlito feud, tonight's storytelling of that rivalry was effective and cool.  This is one of the better Classic Elimination matches I've seen in a while.  The only complaint I have is that there are moments where the action goes so fast that the cameras and the commentary aren't in synch.  See RVD's elimination as an example.  Also, I wish Kurt Angle would be given a little more respect on WWE TV lately.  Still, a good match.  If you think SMACKDOWN delivered a good Elimination Match, wait 'till you get a load of RAW's!
""7.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Heidenreich vs. The Undertaker
---Am I the only one a little disappointed with this one?  When I hear Tazz and Cole talk about Heidenreich is giving Taker a run for his money, I don't see that on the screen.  Heidenreich's a weird character, and his in-ring performances are hard to describe.  I guess I just can't buy that Taker would have such a hard time putting this particular opponent away.  Not a bad match, but Heidenreich needs a little tune-up before The Undertaker can make him famous.
""6.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Women's Championship
Trish Stratus (champion) vs. Lita
---I'm not even going to write a grade for this one, because the match ends within 2 minutes!  Lita and Stratus are the two of the best women athletes in WWE, but this was a pitiful way to reward fans for the all of the sweet buildup.
""No Grade""
________________________________________________

WWE Championship
JBL (champion) vs. Booker T
---I really do not like this match that much.  Booker T and Layfield work too slow to keep things going.  I actually liked Orlando Jordan's interference, because it kept the match going at a smoother pace than JBL and Booker were.  Maybe I need to watch this one again, but I wasn't hooked at all, and couldn't wait for the end to come.
""4.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Survivor Series Match
Winners Gain Control of RAW
Batista, Triple H, Gene Snitsky, & Edge vs.
Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Randy Orton, & Maven
---Thank God this is the main event instead of Booker/JBL!  I honestly didn't know if Maven would show up.  I'm glad he did so that the Handicap cliches didn't start showing their ugly faces.  This match is out of control!  Even HHH's team can't keep things going; their tense egos get themselves into deep trouble.  Even when it's down to a handicap situation, the match never slows down.  A very good finish to a surprisingly good SURVIVOR SERIES PPV.
""8.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

You might wonder how I can call this the best PPV of the year when I have a below-average score, plus a match that isn't graded.  Well, the positives outweight the negatives by a longshot, so I stopped caring about the sore spots.  2004 was not a good year for WWE, especially because SMACKDOWN had a terrible year overall, and RAW was doing good TV but mediocre PPV.  But on this night, the WWE was in top form.  SURVIVOR SERIES was a pleasant surprise back in November, and it holds up very well.",1121817600,4,4520,5.002680965147453

Match One-Fatal Fourway-Cruiserweight Championship-Spike Dudley(C)Vs Billy Kidman Vs Chavo Guerrero Vs Rey Mysterio-This was a very good high flying match with lots of great action and high flying action to start off this show. I believe this match was an excellent match except it should have got a little more time. My rating 7.84/10.

Match Two-Intercontinental Championship-Shelton Benjamin(C)Vs Christian-This was an excellent match with Shelton continuing to do great in the ring as well as Christian being his usual best. Tyson Tomko interfered a lot in this match but it was alright. Maybe next time these two meet they have a match with no interference. My rating 7.98/10.

Match Three-Elimination Match-Team Guerrero-Eddie Guerrero,RVD,Big Show & John Cena Vs Team Angle-Kurt Angle,Mark Jindrak,Luther Reigns & Carlito Carribean Cool-Carlito got chased off before this match started so it became a handicap match. The match was an alright match compared match to some Survivor Series matches. Good ending telling the story of this match and showing what the future brings for these wrestlers. My rating 7.91/10.

Match Four-Undertaker Vs Heidenreich-This was a lot longer then what I was expecting it was about sixteen minutes and length. Both men pulled out all their trademark moves and finishers in an attempt to put the other man down for the three count. I liked this match a lot as it was very exciting. My rating 8.01/10.

Match Five-Womens Championship-Trish Stratus(C)Vs Lita-This was a poor match with a screwed up result. If they wanted to do this they should have put it on Sunday Night Heat or even on Raw. All of this rating is cause one of them got busted open. My rating 0.48/10.

Match Six-WWE Championship-JBL(C)Vs Booker T-This was a nice match except for the interference from Orlando Jordan. The length was good maybe it should have been a little longer. It shouldn't have been the main event as it didn't tell much of a story. My rating 7.28/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-Elimation Match-Winner Controls Raw For A Month-Team Orton-Randy Orton,Maven,Chris Benoit & Chris Jericho Vs Team HHH-HHH,Gene Snitsky,Batista & Edge-This was an awesome match with a great story that was told. Noone was wasted in this match and they were all used to their maximum potential. My rating 8.82/10.

This show was a very good show with lots of awesome matches. The score is 48.32 out of 70 which is a good score. That in a percentage is 69.02% which is a good score. The percentage in a grade is B.

SPIKE DUDLEY defeated CHAVO GUERRERO, BILLY KIDMAN & REY MYSTERIO in a Fatal Fourway to Retain the Cruiserweight Title: Good choice as opener. Excellent non-stop pace made the 9 minute duration seem a fair bit longer. A little bit too much one on one action in a fourway for my liking, but it wasn't over the top. Very good spots which were booked & performed well, even if there was nothing we haven't seen before. Being critical, the storytelling could have been a little better & the booking of Spike retaining the title is questionable. But overall, an excellent example of how most ppvs should be opened; Fast-paced, entertaining action. Match Rating...8

SHELTON BENJAMIN defeated CHRISTIAN to Retain the InterContinental Title: At different stages of these 2 guys' careers, I have been critical of them. But there was almost nothing to be critical of here in this tremendous bout. What looked like a good feud on paper was booked & performed very well in this 13 minute match. Excellent storytelling, very good psychology, a more than sufficient pace, a few new moves & enough near falls to make anyone happy. The match of the night, and quite possibly the midcard match of the year, should propel Benjamin & solidify Christian in the upper midcard. Kudos to everyone involved. Match Rating...9

EDDIE GUERRERO, ROB VAN DAM, JOHN CENA & THE BIG SHOW defeated KURT ANGLE, LUTHER REIGNS, MARK JINDRAK & CARLITO CARIBBEAN COOL: Only RVD was eliminated from the face team. Except for a prolonged period where Eddie played the face in peril, the faces pretty much dominated this 15 minute match. Carlito never took part in the match & Cena did almost as little. As short & relatively unexciting as the match was, it fit the style of the classic 4 on 4 format to a large extent. Angle was great, while Reigns & Jindrak tried. If anything, this match suffered due to the unfortunate timing of Carlito's shoulder injury, but once they announced Cena's return, the match had to go ahead as planned. The rating is a little nice, but I felt this was still a decently entertaining old-style elimination match. Match Rating...7

THE UNDERTAKER defeated HEIDENREICH: Way better than anyone could have expected. A very slow opening, but the match gathered steam as Heidenreich felt a little more comfortable in the ring. Fortunately, he didn't do anything too badly, while 'Taker was his usual self. Decent big man match which did a good job of storytelling, by actually making us believe that Heidenreich was some sort of a chance to win, with some well-performed near falls. At 16 minutes in length though, there is no doubt that this was 5-7 minutes too long. Kudos should also be given to Tazz, Cole, Heyman & the referee, who did the little things to make the match look better than what it probably was. Match Rating...5

TRISH STRATUS defeated LITA by Disqualification to Retain the Women's Title: I'm tempted to completely leave this match out of the PPV rating. The match itself only lasted 1 minute & all up (including entrances) only 5 minutes was used up. It's sort of a shame as the intensity here was probably the greatest ever seen in a women's match. Furthermore, you could just see a character change in Lita developing. Obviously though, this was totally a storyline match & that should be considered. Somehow, Lita comes out a stronger face & Trish a stronger heel, because of this (for want of a better word) match. So it was effective in a few ways. How do you rate a match like this!?!?!? Match Rating...5

JOHN BRADSHAW LAYFIELD defeated BOOKER T to Retain the WWE Championship: Inconsistent bout that looked really ordinary at some stages, yet excellent at others. Good intensity to begin with, but fairly quickly became a plodding mish-mash of a nothing match. That was until Booker found another gear, got the crowd involved, and genuinely looked like a main eventer. Ref bumps & run-ins meant the finish was overbooked, but at least it kept up the excitement all the way through to the ending at the 15 minute mark. No classic, but I really liked the stronger points of this match. Let's hope Booker can get his title win next month. Match Rating...7

RANDY ORTON, CHRIS JERICHO, MAVEN & CHRIS BENOIT defeated TRIPLE H, EDGE, GENE SNITSKY & BATISTA: Orton's push continues as he was the sole survivor here, pinning Edge & Triple H with an RKO each at the end. Predominantly entertaining, despite some questionable booking. I get the feeling there may be a bigger picture though, so it's definitely forgivable to some extent. Plus, those eliminated early in this 24 minute match, were made to look strong just before their eliminations. Could have been better in so many ways, but at the end of the day, it was sufficiently intriguing, intense, well-performed & entertaining. Match Rating...7

PPV RATING (48/70) = 69

Looking at the key, I have given Survivor Series a 'B' grade & have said that it was a 'Good event that was worth the money'. Right on, if I do say so myself. I actually cannot believe that this ppv has come in for a bit of a hammering around the internet. But I believe that some of that displeasure may have been due to some questionable results, rather than the matches themselves. Yes, JBL & Spike are still champs. Yes, the 'Taker match went way too long & the women's match never really eventuated. Yes, Orton's push gets bigger by the day. However, the matches were all quite good. The 2 openers were both excellent, while both 4 on 4 elimination matches were fairly well put together. Definitely an event which could have been better, but was still fairly good. In my opinion, this is indeed a contender for pay-per-view of the year.",1114732800,,6238,4.719669117647059

CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Spike Dudley

As usual, Spike Dudley was there to pick up the pieces.

The Fatal Four Way Match featuring four of the most athletic WWE Superstars on the planet certainly didn't disappoint at Survivor Series on Sunday night.

As the wild match came to a close, Chavo Guerrero seemed poise to take home the Cruiserweight Championship when he hit the Gory Bomb on Spike Dudley.

But Billy Kidman -- the same man who put Guerrero out of action for two months with a Shooting Star Press -- broke up the pin with a leg drop to Guerrero's head.

After Rey Mysterio sent Kidman out of the ring, Dudley found just enough energy to cover a shaken Guerrero to retain his championship.

WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP

Trish Stratus vs. Lita

Lita had no intention of trying to capture the Women's Championship at Survivor Series.

Instead, this was strictly about payback for all of the pain and humiliation Trish Stratus has inflicted over the past few months.

Lita tossed Trish face-first into a steel chair and the security barrier before hitting her with a chair and possibly breaking Trish's nose, which was bleeding profusely.

Lita was officially disqulaified, although she didn't seem to care.

CLASSIC SURVIVOR SERIES ELIMINATION MATCH

Kurt Angle, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns & Carlito Caribbean Cool vs.

Eddie Guerrero, Rob Van Dam, Big Show & John Cena

Kurt Angle tried to leave, he even tried to call a timeout.

None of it worked as Team Guerrero recorded a resounding victory over Team Angle at Survivor Series.

After Big Show chokeslammed Luther Reigns, Angle was left to fend for himself against Latino Heat, Show and John Cena.

After attempting to leave, he was dragged back into the ring, where Cena connected on a F-U before Guerrero landed his frog splash.

Rob Van Dam was the first to be officially pinned, followed by Mark Jindrak, which still left Team Guerrero with a 3-2 advantage in Superstars.

Angle's team began the match at a distinct disadvantage when Carlito Caribbean Cool never even bothered to compete.

Cena, understandably still angry at Cool for stealing his United States Championship, attacked Carlito and associate Jesus immediately after his introduction.

The brawl continued backstage with Cool and Jesus eventually getting in a car and speeding out of Gund Arena.

 CLASSIC SURVIVOR SERIES ELIMINATION MATCH

Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky & Edge vs.

And that's all he needed.

Orton overcame the odds at Surivor Series, single-handedly leading his team to victory.

With partners Maven, Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit all eliminated, it was the Legend Killer left to fend off both Edge and Triple H.

He managed to pin Edge, but Triple seemed in control and was ready to plant him with the Pedigree. But a quick reversal by Orton led to the RKO, giving Team Orton total control of RAW for the next month.

Edge eliminated Benoit and Chris Jericho knocked out Batista early on. Eventually, Gene Snitsky was done in by Maven, who returned mid-match after Snitsky attacked him backstage earlier in the night.

Triple H would eliminate Maven.

INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP

Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian

Christian had the support of his peeps and his Problem Solver, but it wasn't enough at Survivor Series.

Shelton Benjamin would retain his Intercontinental Championship in Cleveland in a hard-fought affair.

Christian did everything in his power to steal the championship. He tried to knock Benjamin out with the belt. And then when referee Earl Hebner wasn't looking, Tomko laid a Big Boot to Benjamin's face.

But the resilient Benjamin kicked out and managed to reverse the Unprettier and hit Christian with a T-Bone slam for the victory.

UNDERTAKER VS. HEIDENREICH

It wasn't easy, but Undertaker got his revenge on the unstable Heidenreich.

It took a massive chokeslam, the Last Ride, and finally, a punishing Tombstone to put the eccentric rookie away.

It was Heidenreich who cost Taker the WWE Championship at No Mercy when he violently interfered in Undertaker's match with JBL.

Still, this match wasn't made until Heidenreich's manager Paul Heyman tracked Undertaker down for a secret and bizarre contract signing.

Taker signed the contract and promised an execution for Heidenreich. As he usually does in the big events, Taker delivered with a vintage performance.

 WWE CHAMPIONSHIP

JBL vs. Booker T

It isn't always pretty. In fact, it doesn't even seem fair sometimes.

But JBL once again retained his WWE Championship by defeating Booker T at Survivor Series.

JBL had guaranteed to win the match, promising to leave SmackDown! forever if he had lost.

But that didn't happen, thanks in part to Chief of Staff Orlando Jordan, whose constant meddling distracted Booker T all night.

And while Booker got in plenty of shots on Jordan, it was one last distraction that gave JBL the opportunity to nail Booker with the belt and record the pin.

Josh Mathews, who has formed a bond with Booker in recent weeks, came to the ring to aid his friend. But JBL quickly dispatched of the lightweight announcer with a Clothesline From Hell.

2067348,4,B00028G6RQ,"1) Cruiserweight fatal four way. chavo vs rey mysterio vs billy kidman vs spike dudley. this match was not as good as expected. i thought it was going to be super fast paced. it was fast paced but it looked like the cruiserweights were tired. nontheless there were some real cool high spots. spike ended up winning the cruiserweight title again. pretty good opener for the show. 7/10

2)Intercontinental title. Shelton Benjamin vs Christian. This match was a lot better than excpected. these two put on a really good match. the crowd wasn't really into it because they thought it would be a crappy match but these two wrestlers really delivered. very good match. 8/10

3) 8 man tag. John Cena, Eddie Guerro, RVD, Big show vs Carlito Caribean cool, Luther Reigns, Mark Jindrak, Kurt Angle. this was a good match but at the begining Carlito and John Cena left the ring and headed backstage. Carlito got in a car and left the arena. john Cena got back in the match but he only did one move and that was it. He was never oficially taged. the match was good. nothing really special but it was still a good match. 7/10

4)Undertaker vs Heidenreich. I can not stand to see the Under taker and Heidenreich wrestle. the undertaker was never a good wrestler and Heidenreich should go back to OVW. they are both terrible wrestlers. Heidenreich pushed Underatker too his limits but it was still a dreadfull match. 5/10

5)Womens Championship. Trish vs Lita. I don't thing we can actually call this a match. i was looking forward to seeing a good match delivered by Lita and Trish but it didn't happen. Lita came out and Just started beating on Trish. She hit Trish with a steel chair and got disqualified. pointless and boring. 3/10 for the steel chair shot.

6)Undisputed Championship. JBL vs Booker T.Excluding the match between Lita and Trish this by far was the worst match of the night.this was so slow and boring. Booker tried everything to win the title but in the end JBL cheated to get the win. Can JBL win a match with out cheating. 4/10

7)8 Man Tag. Triple H, Batista, Edge, Gene Snitsky vs Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Maven, Randy Orton. I think people rated this match way to high. it was an average match. nothing special happened in this match. i don't think they made this match for good wrestling. i think they made the match for the out come. the winner gets to control raw. any ways i didn't think it was amazing but it was good. 7/10

Overall this was a good ppv. there were no average matches. they were either good or bad. this would be a good DVD to pick up. enjoy",1111017600,,2577,4.517167381974249

Spike Dudley(champ) vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman

O.K. match. I hate it how Spike wins though. He picks up the scraps of someone(can't remember who for sure) and gets the pin(7*) 10 being most

2. WWE Intercontinental Championship

Shelton Benjamin(Champ) vs. The SLB Chistian

Good match. Shelton and Christian do a good job in this match. Shelton retains.(8*)

3. Smackdown! Classic Survivor Series Match

Eddie Guerrero, Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena vs. Kurt Angle, Carlito Caribbean Cool, Mark Jindrak, and Luther Reigns

Good match, but of course the Raw classic match is better. It gets down to Eddie, Show, and Cena, vs. Angle. Cena F-U's him and get the pinfall.(8*)

4. Undertaker vs. Heidenreich with Paul Heyman

Good match. Both do awesome though I hate Heidenreich. He's retarded. Right now the Royal Rumble is coming up and they are having another match, a Casket Match. Thats the match I want to see of them. Undertaker wins this match but does look pretty freaked out after the match.(7*)

5. WWE Women's Championship

Trish Stratus(Champ) vs. Lita

Good match for like the minute it lasted. Lita gets Tris outside and slams her against the baricade. Then smashes her nose several time with a chaor and is disqualified. These two have a rematch for the title 3 or 4 weeks after this on Raw and its a classic Divas match. Lita wins the title(not tonight but on Raw a couple weeks later).(no stars... not really a real match.

6. WWE Championship Match

JBL(Champ) vs. Booker T

Good match till JBL cheats, yet again, top regain the title. Booker T should have won though. But now the Royal Rumble is coming up and JBL has to defend his title in a Triple Threat Match against Kurt Angle and The Big Show. I hope Big Show kills em both(not litterally lol).(7*)

7. Raw Classic Survivor Series Match

Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven vs. Triple H, Edge, Batista, and Gene Snitsky

Awesome match! Best on the card. It gets down to Randy Orton fighting Triple H, and Edge I think. In the end, Edge goes to spear Orton but he moves and Edge spears HHH by accident. Edge turns around and is laid with an RKO and then a pin. Triple H also eventually gets RKO'ed out of no where and Ortons team wins. During the 4 weeks they control Raw, Eugene and William Regal become Tag Team Champs, Lita wins the Womans Title, and their becomes no World Heavyweight Champion after Edge taps to the crippler at the same time Benoit is pinned in a Triple Threat match against Triple H so there is no World Heavyweight Champion.",1105056000,,2723,4.668763102725367

Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Spike Dudley for the Cruiserweight Championship.  This was a great way to kick off Survivor Series.  Wait I take that back, no it wasn't.  The winner of this match was probably picked out of a hat.  How in the world does spike retain the championship.  It ends when Chavo hits a Gory Bomb on Spike but Kidman did a leg drop and Spike covered Chavo for the win what garbage. (5/10)

Trish Stratus vs. Lita for the Women's Championship.  This was a squash match that didn't last very long at all.  It ended when Lita tossed Trish face-first into a steel chair and the security barrier before hitting her with a chair when she obviously got disqualified. (4/10)for the wicked chair shot.

Kurt Angle, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns & Carlito Caribbean Cool vs. Eddie Guerrero, Rob Van Dam, Big Show & John Cena.  This match was the return of John Cena to get his revenge on Carlito for stabbing him in a night club.  It ends when Cena connected on a F-U before Guerrero hit his Frog Splash on Kurt Angle. (8/10)

Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky & Edge vs. Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Maven & Chris Jericho.  This was believe it or not, not as good as the Smackdown! Elimination Match.  It ended when Triple H was ready to plant Orton with a Pedigree but orton reveresed and hit a RKO to pick up the win for his team. (7/10)

Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian for the Intercontinental Championship.  This match is overrated.  I don't get why you people like it so much.  Christian is a horrible wrestler with no talent but Benjamin has a lot of talent and that is the reason what the rating is.  It ends when Benjamin reversed the Unprettier into a T-Bone Suplex for the three. (4/10)

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich.  This match was right in the middle but it really wasn't that good.  I expected a great battle between these two but I guess I will have to settle for the Royal Rumble when they meet in a Casket Match.  Anyways it ends when Taker hits a massive Chokeslam, a Last Ride & a punishing Tombstone. (5/10)

JBL vs. Booker T for the WWE Championship.  This was a must interseting match with everybody routing for Booker because if he won not only would JBL lose the title but JBL would QUIT!!!!  It ends when Orlando Jordan distracted Booker and then JBL hit him with the belt to score the pinfall.  (6/10)  JBL you thought you were screwed at Armageddon wait for the Rumble.

Seem I love wrestling they are still worth the 30 bucks to see live but I wish WWE would actually put in an effort to create a good ppv every month. The mid card is the real let down for WWE ppv's in the last year and it should be worked on in the coming months. Anyway here are my Armageddon predictions in predicted order.

Cruiserweight Title
Spike Dudley(c) vs. Chavo Guerrero TIME-10 minutes 7/10
This match hasn't been added to the Armageddon PPV yet but I think a cruiserweight title match will be added and this is my choice. This won't be a classic but will be okay and hopefully Chavo will win the title setting up a Chavo vs. Kidman match at WM 21.
WINNER-Chavo Guerrero

Special Guest Referee-Charlie Haas
Miss Jackie vs. Dawn Marie TIME-4 minutes 4/10
Here it comes, A Haas heel turn. This will be one of the worst matches of the year but atleast it gives Haas the chance to turn heel and get a huge push. I think Haas will cost Jackie the match.
WINNER-Dawn Marie

U.S Championship-Street Fight
John Cena(c) vs. Jesus TIME-12 minutes 7/10
To be honest I can care less about this match. It will be given some time and probably will be decent but I know who's going to win anyway. Cena won't lose on his 1st title defence. The street fight stipulation makes it alot more interesting though and hopefully we will get lots of weapon use. Cena will win with the F.U at around the 12 minute mark.
WINNER-John Cena

3 0n 1 handicapped Match
Big Show vs. Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns,Mark Jindrak TIME-12 minutes 7.5/10
I thought this would be Show vs. Luther but now the Big Show has to take on all three members of Kurt Angles group. Even though the single wrestler normally wins Handicapped matches I think Kurt Angle,Reigns and Jindrak will win this 10-15 minute  match after cheating.
WINNER-Kurt Angle,Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak

Tough enough final 2 match-Dixie Dog Fight
Daniel Puder vs. Mike Mizanin TIME-4 minutes 5/10
This will be a squash match with Puder winning to set up him winning the TE competition.
WINNER-Daniel Puder

WWE Tag Team Titles
Dupree/Suzuki(c) vs. RVD/Rey Mysterio TIME-15 minutes 9/10
This is going to be a great high flying match and probably about 15 minutes long which I am happy about. I think Mysterio/RVD will have to wait until WM 21 to get the titles against the Dudley Boyz as Dupree and Suzuki will cheat to win here.
WINNER-Dupree/Suzuki

WWE Championship
JBL(c) vs. The Undertaker vs. Eddie Guerrero vs. Booker T TIME-25 minutes 10/10
I am looking forward to this match so much. It is so unpredictable and should be entertaining being a whirlwind fatal fourway match. Everyone thinks Taker will win but I don't think he will because that will be his 5th title win and I think he will do that in a more special moment. I am tipping Eddie to win the title by picking up the crumbs. JBL will get a finisher from Booker T followed by Taker then Undertaker will get taken over the top rope by Booker T which leaves Eddie to hit the frogsplash on JBL and win the title.
WINNER-Eddie Guererro

Overall the main event should be a match of the year contender and the tag title match, the handicapped Match and Cena vs. Jesus in a streetfight should be all decent. I think it will be much better than last years event and I am looking forward to it more aswell.",1101945600,,3393,4.504065040650406

Match #1: Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guererro vs. Billy Kidman vs. Spike Dudley (c) for the Cruiserweight Championship: I really thought Kidman was gonna take this, but in the end Spike retained! Great match with awesome performances by all. Kidman hits a MEAN standing dropkick on Spike early in the match! AWESOME! 9/10

Heidenreich and Snitsky have a weird run in with eachother. Two of the dumbest characters in the WWE meet up to talk about punting babies and writing poetry...odd yet hilarious at the same time!

Match #2: Shelton Benjamin (c) vs. Christian w/ Tomko for the Intercontinental Championship: Great match! Shelton proves just how great he is and Christian does too. I thought these two wouldn't have good chemistry, but I was deinitely wrong! Shelton pulls out the victory even after constant interference from Tomko! 8/10

Kurt runs into Edge backstage and they talk a little smack to eachother. Kurt throws the fact that Edge wasn't picked at Taboo Tuesday, instead it was Shawn Micheals. Edge then says that he took Michaels out, which is something Kurt has never done...Could this be hinting a possible interpromotional match between Kurt and Michaels at WM 21? We'll just have to ait and see...

Match #3: Team Guererro vs. Team Angle in a Classic SS match: This is where I got disappointed. Eventhough Cena came back, I thought for sure Kurt's team was gonna win. Turns out Kurt's team got their butts handed to them and the only one they eliminated was RVD (the best wrestler on Eddie's team). Garbage! Cena didn't even have a scar! 2/10

Match #4: Heidenreich vs. The Undertaker: Not great, but better then I thought it was gonna be. Undertaker wins with the Tombstone. 5/10 cuz I'm really starting to hate the Undertaker!

Match #5: Trish (c) vs. Lita for the Women's Championship: No Contest cuz Lita destroyed Trish, by busting her against the wall with a steel chair breaking her nose!!! AWESOME! Lita DQed, Trish retains! I can't wait for Lita to totally destroy her next week on Jericho's RAW! 5/10 only cuz there should have still been a match!

Match #6: JBL (c) vs. Booker T for the WWE Championship: JBL is a great champ, but Booker should have won this match. It looked like he was gonna overcome the odds, but Orlando interferred too much! Even Josh Matthews came out to help Booker but he was destroyed! JBL retains in a decent match! 7/10

Match #7: Team Orton vs. Team HHH in a Classic SS match for Complete Control of RAW: Good match, but had a lot of bad points...First of all, Benoit was eliminated first after putting on the best performance in the whole match (why they are screwing over the best wrestler on RAW, I'll never understand). Then after we thought Maven was taken out, he makes a miraculous come back only to be drilled by Gene Snitsky yet again. Atleast he messed Snitsky up bad before we was completely eliminated. Orton is the sole survivor after taking on Edge and HHH and putting them down with RKOs!!! 8/10

Not as good as SS 2003, but decent. Watch it for the first 2 matches and to see Lita destroy Trish!",1101859200,,3165,4.686486486486486

Chavo Guerrero vs. Billy Kidman vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Spike Dudley

As usual, Spike Dudley was there to pick up the pieces.

The Fatal Four Way Match featuring four of the most athletic WWE Superstars on the planet certainly didn't disappoint at Survivor Series.

As the wild match came to a close, Chavo Guerrero seemed to poise to take home the Cruiserweight Championship when he hit the Gory Bomb on Spike Dudley.

But Billy Kidman--the same man who put Guerrero out of action for two months with a Shooting Star Press--broke up the pin with a leg drop to Guerrero's head.

After Rey Mysterio sent Kidman out of the ring, Dudley found just enough energy to cover a shaken Guerrero to retain his championship.

 This was an incredible match.  When Cena comes out Carlito and Jesus start running all over the place.  Carlito, Jesus & Cena all go into the back and Cena beats up Jesus and Carlito escapes.  Team Guerrero won after an F-U, Chokeslam & a Frog Splash on Kurt Angle to win. 10/10

Heidenreich v. Undertaker

  This was another great match.  Another Undertaker classic.  Heidenreich pts up a fight then Taker hits a Chokeslam, a Last Ride & a Tombstone Piledriver to beat Heidenreich. 10/10

Trish Stratus v. Lita  Women's Title

  This was a very quick match.  I'll only give it a rating because of the Chair Shot.  Lita should have won the title and this actually be a match instead of a brawl. 1/10

JBL v. Booker T  WWE Title

  This was another Smackdown! match that was incredible.  JBL said that if he lost to Booker he would never wrestle again.  Josh Matthews tried to come and save Booker but he got a Clothesline From Hell.  JBL retained when he did the same on Booker T. 10/10

Team Orton=Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit & Maven v. Team Triple H=Triple H, Edge, Gene Snitsky & Batista

1. Cruiserweight Title- Really hoped Kidman would win, but it was such a good match i cannot be disappointed with the results. 9/10

2. Intercontinental Title- Christian and Benjamin really gave it their all in what I consider a tie for match of the night. Benjamin showed howed creative he can be on offense and deserved the win here. 9/10

3. Smackdown Elimination Match- I was mad that I didn't get to see Carlito go at it with Cena, but with his shoulder hurt he had to get out of the match somehow.  This match deserved more time and went far too fast.  7/10

4. Women's Title- Not even a match, only served to build up the heat between the best two women wrestlers the WWE has to offer.

5. Undertaker vs. Heidenreich- What is with Vince's fetish with the big guys?  i am a big fan of Undertaker and am happy to have gotten to see him at HIS event before he retires in the next few years.  Taker carries Heidenreich to a passable match.  he wins after delivering all 3 of his finishers.  6.5/10

6. WWE Championship- Will someone please give JBL some friggin credit?  You may not like his style or his gimmick but he works his ass off in his PPV matches and no one seems to notice.  I was hoping to see a title change since Booker T hs been around os long and deserves it and will be retiring in the next year or so.  But once again JBL retains....why can't they let him win one fair and square?  7.5/10

7. Raw Elimination Match- Match of the Night.  The only Problem I have with this match is Chris Benoit being eliminated FIRST......Anyway I liked the angle with Maven and Snitsky and how Orton was left to fend for himself against HHH and Edge.  After Edge was gone the match ended very quickly with an RKO, what happened to building up an end? Oh well.  9/10",1100736000,3,1922,4.271468144044321

Spike Dudley def Kidman, Mysterio and chavo (retains cruiserweight title) awesome edge of your seat cruiserweight action and by the way i really thought chavo deserved to win. 9.5/10

Shelton Benjamin def Christian (retained Intercontinental title) this was actually MUCH better than i thought, shelton benjamin is a tremendous athelete and i think he should be a top contender for the worlds title. Tomko gets involved a little, shelton with an awesome dragon whip knocking him off the apron then christian goes for the unprittier and its countered to a t-bone for the 3 count. 9/10

Smackdown classic elimination match

John Cena returns with out rapping or going crazy or tagging the fans hands but chases carlito out of the arena. He beats up Hesus but Carlito then takes a womans car and drives out of the arena therefore is no longer part of the match. It was a quiet dissapointing match but most importantly Cena's back! and he gets a U.S title shot on Smackdown! Eddie's team win after eliminating kurt at the end with an f-u and a frog spalsh 6.5/10

Undertaker v.s Heidenrich

Again im not a very big fan of undertaker's match's but it was ok. I prefered it when he had his old character. Taker wins by a tombstone. 6/10

Lita v.s Trish

i really can't rate this cause it wasn't even a match. I thought it was gonna come out as a great fight but instead Lita went mad and disqualified herself by whacking Trish twice with a steel chair then busting her nose open by whacking her on the steps.

Jbl v.s Booker T

For god's sake is jbl ever gonna win fair and square? i was really looking forward for booker to become a six time champ. jbl retains by a title shot. 7.5/10

Randy's team v.s HHH team

Match of the night! im really happy with the result. Order of eliminations:

1.) Benoit by edge

2.)Batista by orton's title shot and jericho's runnin enzuguri

3.)Snitsky by DQ, whacked, jericho, orton and maven with chair therefore:

4.) Maven by HHH (Snitsky's steel chair shot)

5.)Jericho by Edge's spear

6.) Edge by RKO

7.) HHH by RKO

That's right, they ignore that oppertunity and keep the belt on Spike for another month, **1/2 just because Chavo and Rey actually WRESTLED as opposed to jump very high and stomp on people's heads.

Team Guerrero vs Team Angle: What the hell was this? John Cena and Carlito take thier feud to the back and to an obvious set up to excuse Carlito's injuries and incapability to compete by having Carlito flee the arena, Cena takes apart Johnny Stamb...I mean Chuck Pulum...I mean Jesus, and then shows just dedicated he is to improving his wrestling skills to match his TREMENDOUS face pops by delivering ONE measly F-U on Kurt Angle, only a month into filming a movie and ALREADY he has ""Hollywood Rock ring rust"".

Kurt's team is eliminated in rapid succession, with only Rob Van Dam getting eliinated on Guerrero's side, and Kurt plays the last few minutes for cheap laughs for the heel in danger, Kurt is squashed by a frog splash and pinned by The Big Show, ** just because Luther and Angle made something out of this, and hey, at least this time Eddie more or less went over

Snitzky and Hiendereich meet backstage, promoting the worst promo exchange on PPV, and I loved every second of it.

WWE Intercontiental Championship: Christian vs Shelton Benjamen: Christian's new music indicates the WWE have a new target audience: TEENY POP, A.J Christian takes the match to Benjamen, *** for the match, * for the crowd NOT reacting...to anything so far.

WWE Women's Championship: Trish Status vs Lita: This wasn't even a match, just a glrodfied build-up to Wrestlemania 21, Lita hits Trish with some badly laid out chair shots, J.B.L she isn't, BY GOD, SHE BUSTED TRISH' NOSE OPEN, LOOK AT THE SMALL, INSIGNIFICANT TRINKLES, HENIOUS, BY GOD! DUD.

Maven is eliminated by Snitzky backstage, saving us all from one of his promos.

Undertaker defeated Heidenreich: As bad as we thought it'd be, does Hiendereich play his role well? Yup, does Hiendereich play his offense well? Nope

WWE Championship: J.B.L dfefeated Booker T, Noone cared for Booker going INTO this match, and therfore niether us or the crowd had any right to care now, J.B.L goes over, **1/2, watch ONLY for Josh Matthew impersonate The Flash when he's running in to make the save for Booker.

Team Orton defeated Team Triple H: Snitzky in a main event, Edge and his new music in a main event, that alone should make it a ***** match by default, but common sense forces me to give it ***, Benoit was eliminated criminally first, Jericho was made to look like a [...] by everyone but Batista, Hunter didn't do anything but take crippler crossfaces and walls of Jerichos, and do his customary job at Survvior Series, Orton looked like he couldn't be bothered, Edge and Snitzky looked like they COULD be bothered.

Anti-climatic finish means Orton's team takes control of RAW for a month, this whole feud was one sided, only this time the faces dominated the heels, as much as I am going to love a literal ""RAW IS BENOIT"" and ""RAW IS JERICHO"", the prospects of seeing Hunter try and find ways of keeping his championship against his fellow General Manger teamates every week would have been something interesting.",1100476800,,3376,4.805172413793104

Fatal Four Way match: Wow, very good for an opening, lots of high moves and the crowd was really into it. Rey gives kidman a hurricanrana off the ring onto the floor! Then Kidman gives Chavo an electric chair, while Chavo gave Spike a suplex at the same time! Very good, and Spike wins. 9/10

Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian: This was better than it looked, even though Tyson Tomko was involved. Shelton and Christian were given a fair amount of time and delivered to the crowd. Back and forth battle with Shelton winning after giving the Dragon kick to Tomko and the T-Bone Suplex to Christian. 8/10

Smackdowns Survivor Series match: Cena returns with a vengeance, chasing Jesus and Carlito into the parking lot. Kurt, meanwhile, is soon left to face Big Show, Cena, and Guerrero as the match went on. After the Fu and a Frog Splash, Big Show pins Kurt. It was okay, but not great. 8/10

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich: It was watchable, but should have been left for Smackdown. The crowd was into it though, so that saved it. Undertaker wins after the tombstone. 7/10

Lita vs. Trish Stratus: Big Disappointment. It really wasn't a match, Lita just beat Trish up and gave her a bloody nose. I like Lita so it didn't really matter, but I was disappointed to see her get disqualified after hitting trish with a chair. No Score.

JBL vs. Booker T: Oh no, not another month with JBL as champ! Thanks a lot Orlando Jordan for screwing Booker out of the title. Even Josh Mathews couldn't save Booker T. A ref was knocked down, Booker got hit by the belt, and JBL wins again. 7.5/10

Raw's Survivor Series match: Now this was a good match. Snitsky gives Maven the biggest chair shot ever seen for a while. Maven was supposedly taken out earlier by Snitsky backstage, but tried to join the fight, only to have his head caved in. Randy wins after Rko'ing Edge and Triple H to get the win for his team. 9/10

I mean come on now Randy Ortan is good but he is no where ready to be a main eventer so what happens they force him down our throats, he reminds me of HBK ala 96 when the little girls and marks loved him but the true fans hated him, but thats what Vince does best, capitolize on the marks, thats why the WWE is number one....now if this ppv isn't marred by short matches and lame segments we got an event of the year...onto the card.

(SmackDown!) WWE World Heavyweight Title Match:

John Bradshaw Layfield (c) vs. Booker T.

this should be the end of JBL's reign in my view, he has been a lame duck champion, Booker T has been a dedicated hard worker from day one, he made a lame gimmick of he and golddust very entertaining, but now its time to give the Book man his dues, and now that they realize he makes a better face, here is a chance for Smackdown to have a worthy champ. possible ***1/2

(SmackDown!) Classic Survivor Series Match:

Kurt Angle (Captain), Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns, and Carlito Carribean Cool vs. Eddie Guerrero (Captain), Rob Van Dam, The Big Show, and ?

Another very good looking match, my guess is Cena is gonna be the mystery man and take a break from his movie for this one match to get revenge on Cool Boy. If this doesn't begin a RVD movement, then who knows, but expect RVD, Jindrak, Angle, Guerrero to be the main guys to make this match good...possible ***** match

(RAW) Classic Survivor Series Match:

Triple H (Captain), Batista, Gene Snitsky and Edge vs. Maven, Chris Benoit (Captain), Chris Jericho and Randy Orton

Maven and Snitskty(master of the mic and hair and looking like he is 12) get a big opportunity in this main event match. Screw Randy Orton, only reason he is getting pushed is cause he is HHH's buddy, much like Hogan pushing his friends...hint hint. Benoit and Jericho should be the major title contendors now Johnny Unitis look a like. Adding Edge for the heels makes this match even more incredible looking....possible ***** match

here comes a dud, Undertake just sucks period, is this the early 90's.....no, go home Mean Mark Callous, as for Heindenreich, get some muscle, his body is pathetic, lay off the roids, get some character but mostly get some skill...just another Undertaker domination in my view, cause rumor has it they are gonna build taker/angle for wrestlemania

two amazing athletes, this is bound to be a serious contender for the show stealer.....possible ***** match

I think there is a build up going on on the smackdown side Kurt Angle, Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak is part of team angle.  Team show is eddie and big show. I don't know how many people will be in this elmination tag but probley will be 5 a peiece.

Also in the smackdown preview it says will JBL have a chance to rest i have a feeling that maybe the  wwe champ match may be announced.

Another key thing is that the wwe usually makes the ppv website prier to the first match they always have that to be announced thing underneath the matche lists

I don't really have any ideas for Raw matchs though as most things are still being built up for the Taboo Tuesday PPV.

As for the undertaker i think Hendrich may be put to rest at SS maybe a buried alive match?

I really hope this will be a fun PPV as i will be there live hopefully the WWE puts out some good matchs

i will review this PPV once all matchs have been called (predictions on how good they will be once im there).  I will then review this after the PPV.  Then review it once the DVD is relesed",1097971200,,1266,3.940944881889764

2067650,1,B00028G6RQ,"The Survivor Series is one of the main WWE PPV's and is held around November each year, and the first one was held back in 1987. The original idea for the Survivor Series that was plotted by the WWE was the desire to see Hogan and Andre clash once more, but they added a twist- there would be tag team elimination matches, and I believe that Hogan and Andre fought eachother in one of those. Every year the Survivor Series follows a 'survival' type style, even if there are no elimination tag team style matches. For example, at Survivor Series 2002, there were none of the elimination tag team matches, but it was the debut of the Elimination Chamber. And in 1998, there was a tournament to decide who the WWE champion would be. That's all for the introduction to the survivor series. But now, here's a history lesson for all you recent wrestling fans:

Survivor Series 1997- 'The Montreal Screwjob'

This is something you will hear often. In 1997 at the Survivor Series, Bret Hart wrestled Shawn Michaels for the WWE Title. Bret was set to leave the company, and told Vince he did not feel it justified himself if he lost it in his own country, and that he should drop the title to Shawn the next night on RAW, or another time. Vince disagreed. In the match, Shawn hit the sharpshooter on Bret, and Vince ordered the referee Earl Hebner to ring the bell, meaning that Bret Hart 'tapped out', which he did not. Bret, after being actually screwed out of the title, spat at Vince, and Shawn followed suit and did the same. Shawn claimed after the show that he was not in on it, but many years later Shawn would go on to say that he was in on it all along, and people still question that today. This is all REAL, by the way.

Since then, Vince has decided to use that same screwjob finish for every Survivor Series in high-stakes matches. So there is a high chance that Vince will use it again at this year's. Here's a list of all the screwjobs that happened in SS history, after 1997:

'97: THE Screwjob

'98: Vince screws Foley out of the title, makes Rock champion

'99: Screws HHH and Rock out of the title, makes Big Show champ

2000: If I remember correctly, someone (I think Edge & Christian) screws 'Taker out of the title, and Kurt retains

'01: Jericho turns heel during Alliance vs. WWE match, almost screws over WWE, then Kurt turns on the Alliance and screws them

'02: Paul Heyman turns on Brock Lesnar during title match, causes Show to win title

'03: The only one here I can think of is Evolution & Bischoff screwing over HBK and Austin, costing Austin his career

So, after all this, do you think that this year's installment will follow suit to the previous years? Most likely. Except now, we have 2 different brands, so that means there could be a screwjob for the World Heavyweight Title, or one for the WWE Title, or one for both (!) or maybe there will be another high-stakes match that could end in a screwjob... (Man, how many times must I use the word screwjob?!!)

Now, once we find out how Taboo Tuesday (RAW PPV) and No Mercy (SD! PPV) go, we'll have a better look on who is more in the title spotlight. But considering the events that happened on SD! and RAW, we'll just use that info for now.

RAW: Orton, Benoit and Benjamin are all feuding with Evolution, so that could open up an elimination tag match somewhere, but another guess is a triple threat match involving Benoit, Orton and Triple H.

This opens up room for Shelton, as he could take on Batista or Flair, or Shelton could team up with Benoit.

Or, Benoit could take on Flair, and Shelton vs. Batista, or vice-verca... which means Randy vs. Triple H.

HBK and Christian have been feuding as of late, and Jericho and Tomko are involved as well. Maybe a tag match, maybe a triple threat match, maybe HBK vs. Christian, there are many possibilities here, but they may be resolves at Taboo Tuesday.

Kane will probably be in there somewhere...

Kurt Angle has formed a little stable between himself and Mark Jindrak and Luther Reigns, and Big Show and Guerrero have become good acquaintances, so a tag match could open up at SS. At No Mercy there's already Eddie vs. Reigns and Show vs. Angle, so there won't be many single matches involving these guys, and I don't think they'll have Kurt vs. Eddie for the third straight RAW and SD! PPV. I doubt that there'll be a triple threat match, but it's possible.

Hopefully it won't be RVD and Mysterio teaming up again, but it could turn out into an elimination tag. I want Mysterio to take on Spike for the Cruiserweight Title, personally.

Cena vs. Booker T for the US Title is being decided at No Mercy, but they could have a rematch or possibly a triple threat, a fatal four-way or possibly a branching over of storylines, blending over with Mysterio/RVD vs. Dudleyz and forming another elimination tag match.

Undertaker vs. JBL? Possibly another rematch, or Undertaker's team vs. JBL's team. I can't take a logical guess at this one...

So, there are my guesses as to what Survivor Series this year might look something like. We'll just have to wait for the results for Taboo Tuesday and No Mercy to have a more detailed situation.",1096156800,,5169,4.5

8023634,4,B00028G6RQ,"Billy Kidman VS Spike Dudley VS Rey Mysterio VS Chavo Guerrero: WWE never got cruiserweight wrestling but they tried with limited wrestlers. It was a great way to start off the PPV and very exciting match. I didn't really care for Spike though and I thought the ending was really well done.

Shelton Benjamin VS Christian: Given the talent between these two I expected much more. It had it's moments but it overall was slow paced and boring. Again, the last few minutes were well done and very exciting.

Kurt Angle, Carlito, Mark Jindrak, and Luther Reigns VS Big Show, John Cena, RVD, and Eddie Guerrero: Cena enters and Jesus (Carlito's bodyguard) and Carlito runs away and they brawl all the way to the back. Cena breaks a car window and Carlito drives off and everyone is brawling on the outside. Things get under control as Cena returns to the ring and Angle's team is down one. The match is flowing real well but with a little under five minutes to go and no one eliminated, I knew things were about to get hectic. RVD gets pinned by Angle and it doesnt even look like a three count and then Eddie gets revenge by rolling up Jindrak. Was he even the legal man? Show chokeslams Reigns and Angle is left all by himself. Cena hits an F-U on Angle and Guerrero hits a nice frog splash and this decent match is over.

Maven gets attacked by Snitsky. Will he return to the main event?

Heidenreich VS Undertaker: I enjoyed it, a very good match up.

Lita VS Trish: Skip

JBL VS Booker T: I loved JBL during this era, he was a very good heel. A pretty good match with Josh Matthews interfering on behalf of Booker T. I couldn't belive it either. It has the typical cheap JBL ending.

Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, and Maven VS Edge, Snitsky, Triple H, and Batista: The winners will get control of Raw for the next month while Bischoff is away on vacation. This was a very good match up.

Overall, a pretty good Suvivor Series.",1259020800,,1938,4.43943661971831
8023635,4,B00028G6RQ,"2004 was a good year and the Survivor Series is one of the reasons why it was. This Survivor Series hosted two Survivor Series Matches and a pretty good mid card to back them up.

1. Fatal Four Way for the WWE Cruiserweight Title
Rey Mysterio vs. Spike Dudley vs. Billy Kidman vs. Chavo Guerrero
This was a pretty solid opener, I really enjoyed trying to keep my eyes on the action. The match had good high risk. Spike took a hard dropkick right to the jaw in the early going. Rey & Chavo put on a good showing. There was some nice 1 on 1 wrestling. Solid opener. 4/5

2. Intercontinental Title
Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian w/ Tomko
These two gave an awesome wrestling match, and Tomko's intereference didn't hurt the match at all either. It started off with some solid wrestling and then it was taken to the outside for a little while. Christian really gave the bad mouth to Shelton in this one. It had some nice counters and Chritian gave some cheap shots to Shelton at some points in the match. It also had very close near pin falls. It ended pretty good as well with the counter into the T-bone suplex. A good title match up. 4.5/5

3. Classic Survivor Series Match
Big Show, Eddie Guerrero, RVD, & John Cena vs. Kurt Angle, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns, & Carlito
It started out with Cena trying to get his hands on Carlito which they fought all the way into the back where Carlito got a way in a car leaving Angle's team to a 4 on 3 disadvantage from the start. Eddie really gets isolated for the better part of the match. It had some clever eliminations. Nice match up but I felt it could have been better. 3/5

4. Undertaker vs. Heidenreich w/ Paul Heyman
This match was pretty much a slugfest. It had a pretty good brawl on the outside. Heidenreich pulled off some nice counters on Taker. Taker pulled off some nice counters and moves as well and even added a little high risk to the match. I was very impressed by this one. I also felt this match was much better than the match placed before it. Pretty good big man match. 4/5

5. Women's Championship
Lita vs. Trish Stratus
This match was very personal especially after all the cheap shots and dirty things Trish did to Lita earlier in year. Lita really took it to Trish in the beginning & just giving her some hard right fists. It soon gets stopped short after due to Lita's stong quest to destroy Trish and thats what she did in this one. Lita broke Trish's nose which stopped the match. Lita really got payback on Trish in this one. 2/5

6. WWE Championship
JBL vs. Booker T
It started out as a good brawl and it went outside where it got pretty physical out there. Once back in the ring, JBL trys to wear down Booker with some nice holds. Booker even pulled off a hard Bookend to JBL on the floor. It had some pretty good counters and reversals. Good title match up and the interference didn't really hurt this match either. 4/5

7. Classic Survivor Series Match
Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, & Maven vs. Triple H, Edge, Snitsky, & Batista
The winners of this match ran Raw for the next four weeks. Orton's team also had a 4 on 3 disadvantage from the start. Maven would soon make a come back and try to clean house. Maven also takes one of the hardest chair shots ever. The were some oppropriate and good elimination spots. The match had a pretty strong ending and it was a good way to end the show. Great match. 4.5/5

Survivor Series '04 was a pretty strong ppv. It had some good one on one matches and a great Survivor Series match. Good ppv to add to your collection.",1218412800,,3550,4.343891402714932
