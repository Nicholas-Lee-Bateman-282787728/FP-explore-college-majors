7905344,2,B000009CE0,"It Seems that this rare concert from P.B.S.'s Soundstage was transfered from a V.H.S. tape.  The audio seems mixed with a reverb to gain a stereo effect on the applause.
Now, if your a Chapin fan like myself, you welcome any live performance recording that comes out.  This copy that I recieved seems to be a bootleg.  Came in a DVD slim case and the lable doesn't cover the D.V.D. print from the store.
Enough said:  You either will enjoy this early Chapin studio concert, or be upset of the quality of the video.
Harry, it still sucks, and we miss ya!",1482364800,,553,4.392156862745098
7905345,4,B000009CE0,"This 1975 TV Special finds Harry Chapin at his most comfortable, on stage, in an intimate setting, telling the backstory and history behind his ""story songs"" while performing them for a loyal and enthusiastic crowd. There are several Chapin stallwarts including ""Mr Tanner"" and  inspired ""What Made America Famous"" along with live versions of hit singles such as ""Taxi"", ""WOLD"", and of course ""Cat's In The Cradle"". Due to when it was filmed some of Chapin's more famous material from later in his career is not featured as this set basically covers a ""Best Of"" selection from his first four albums. There is also a brief ""Question & Answer"" segment with the audience.

""Mr Tanner"", a song that was a staple in Chapin's live show but not a radio hit, is particularly well done in one the very few televised performances he ever did for this number. ""Sniper"" is also a set highlight, Chapin dripping with sweat as he screams and pleads his way through his rock oriented tear through the mind and disillusionment of would be serial killer, with snippets from those who knew him (and didn't particularly care for him). Some might call it grandstanding, others might label it as taking advantage, but there is no doubt that Chapin's full throttle performance is near incredible piece of performance and theater.

The set is hampered somewhat by the lack of material post 1975, there is no rendition of audience favorites such as ""30,000 Pounds of Bananas"", nothing from his acclaimed Dance Band On The Titanic album, and of course no performance of ""Sequel"", his last Top 40 hit just a few months before he passed. What there is here is an enjoyable collection early Chapin standards, with a few classic hits, and a lot of the humorous warmth and accessibility that Chapin often displayed in his live performances. With a value conscious price this an excellent pick up for Harry Chapin fans, fans of the Singer-Songwriter Movement, or just 70s music fans in general.",1436054400,,1963,4.853731343283582

7905347,4,B000009CE0,"This was a gift for my kids' dad who loves Harry Chapin. He introduced Harry Chapin to me when we began dating back in 1976. He saw Harry in concert in KC. Our kids were ""brought up"" listening to Harry. This was a gift for their dad's 60th birthday. I only wish there were more songs that we knew on the dvd. Their dad said, ""Where is the ""Banana song?"" What about, ""A Better Place to be?"" I was pleased with the audio/video quality. I was worried since I'd read reviews both were poor quality. It was an expensive purchase for a short dvd with only a few of his better known pieces, but I think their dad appreciated the gift and all in all, I am glad we bought it.",1344902400,,666,4.091603053435114
7905348,5,B000009CE0,"I saw the original broadcast in 1974 and made a reel-to-reel tape of the audio at that time. I was thrilled when the laserdisk version came out. This review refers to that laserdisk release.

I have several of Harry Chapin's lp's, and in my opinion they suffered from over-production. I am reminded of one of my favorite Chicago folk singers of the '70s, Bonny Koloc, whose albums were overstuffed with instrumentation and never quite captured her soul.

In Book of Chapin, Harry Chapin's soul, and I think the souls of a few other separate characters, are up front for all to see.

Even amid the today's sickening political climate, ""What Made America Famous"" renews my hope. ""Sniper"" is a world-class performance. In 9 minutes you can begin to understand the incomprehensible. You will not see more emotion  or more understanding of the human condition in any novel or opera. If the DVD is the same as the laserdisk, I could not recommend it more highly.",1106092800,2,956,4.775757575757575
7905349,4,B000009CE0,"""It's my Solo!""
 I have mixed emotions about this DVD, being a big Harry Chapin fan I am VERY thrilled that Harry's work has made it to a medium that was only in the development stages when Harry died in 1981. I often wonder what Harry would have thought of Compact Discs and Digital Technology taking over the music, and now movie, industry. The first CD's were released in 1983 by Columbia Records starting with classical music and then pop/rock artists beginning with Billy Joel's ""The Nylon Curtain"". It took several years before any of Harry's music saw the laser light of CD's. The first Harry Chapin CD released was ""Remember When The Music"" in 1987 a repackaging of  ""Sequel"", so I was surprised when I first saw this DVD at my local Tower Records, or should I say Tower Entertainment Store.
The show is titled ""The Book of Chapin"" and was originally broadcast for television in the Inaugural season of PBS's Soundstage Series. It starts off with Harry singing ""What Made America Famous"" to an empty soundstage/auditorium, at the end of the song when Harry sings the closing lyrics ""...Is anybody there?"" the camera zooms in to a head shot of him  and when it zooms out, magically there is an audience and they are applauding enthusiastically. I found that to be a pretty neat visual effect. So obviously Harry sang that particular song twice for this production, once in an empty auditorium and once in front of the live audience.  Another interesting visual effect is a double screen technique during ""Mr. Tanner"" when bass player John Wallace is singing as Mr. Tanner under Harry's lead singing.
The packaging of this DVD is attractive although it is slightly deceiving.
FALSE ADVERTISING!
The description on the back mentions the appearance of Harry's Brother Tom Chapin during this performance, However, Tom never appears on this DVD. Harry's band consists of Michael Masters (cello); Ron Palmer (guitar); and John Wallace (bass), THEY appear in the DVD but Tom never does. Also Harry's regular concert and recording drummer Howie Fields isn't in this performance, which gives the songs a different sound and feeling, some might call it ""Unplugged"" well I have news for you folks Harry Chapin was always ""Unplugged"". Plus the original credits for the PBS Soundstage production has been cut short,  by Platinum Entertainment, the company that packaged this DVD,  before the copyright date gets a chance to be scrolled up the screen. Another typo is the song ""She Sings Songs Without Words"" is misnamed as ""She Sings A Song Without Words"" both in the on-screen song selections menu and the outside packaging. These mistakes Really disappoint and annoy me.
There is no copyright date for this SHOW in the packaging or on the disc, although the DVD is copyrighted 1998 the year that the DVD was released, not the show's original broadcast date. Therefore I feel that this DVD is only part of the original PBS Soundstage Series broadcast called ""The Book of Chapin"". Judging, from the band members who appear, the songs performed, and Harry's appearance, Since I don't know the original broadcast date or when the ""Soundstage Series"" started, I determine this performance to be recorded sometime between 1974 & 1976 the year when Harry's double album ""Greatest Stories Live"" was released. When ""Greatest Stories Live"" was released on CD two of the three studio recorded songs were not included because of time restrictions of early CD's, it has never been repackaged to include those two songs.

Although there are no real extras with this DVD there is a mid-performance Question & Answer session. Since I never saw the original broadcast of this PBS Soundstage performance or any other Soundstage performances that I can recall,  I can only speculate that Q&A sessions are a common occurrence for Soundstage shows. Other than the packaging having misinformation the only thing included in the case is an order form for other DVD's from the Platinum Entertainment...
Overall the quality is very good for a twentysomething (almost 30something) old video concert performance. The picture quality is very good and clean. The audio however is muffled, which might be because of the mid-seventies audio equipment being used to record the actual performance. I really enjoyed the performance and the fact that the songs ""Six String Orchestra"" and ""Sniper"", early Chapin songs rarely done at later Chapin Concerts, are included. I feel this DVD was a case of ""Lets rush a Harry Chapin concert video on to DVD"".
For Picture I give it a 5, and for Sound I give it a 3.",1021939200,45,4567,4.929778933680104
7905350,5,B000009CE0,"Never mind the bad sound quality. Never mind the poor picture quality. It's an evening with Harry Chapin, And for the true fan, it's an all to rare occurance. There is so little of Harry Chapin on video for his fans, and yet, this is where Harry Chapin shown like a bright and shining star, on stage performing to an audience. This is such a special and wonderful moment in time, even bad sound quality does not detract from the pleasure of watching Harry live. Those of you who did not have the pleasure of seeing Harry in concert as I did, will never know what you have missed. It is so rare to behold a performer so pure as Harry, he takes you right into his songs and leaves you feeling as though you are the only member of the audience, and that he is singing only for you. THIS, is just such a performance. This, is what you want to see to feel the experience of the real Harry Chapin. There are too precious few examples of Harry live, This is one of the shining few that cature the man. Buy it with confidence.",952387200,24,1018,4.198979591836735
7905351,5,B000009CE0,"No only did I grow-up around his music, it helped raise me.  I not only remember the music, but I also remember Harry as a friend.  John Wallace, his bass player lived near by.  I can remember playing softball with Harry.  He was as true and crisp as his music.  While this show can bearly do him  justice, it gives people insight into the man Harry was.  Harry's death is  a great lose to all who knew and loved him, but also to those that never  will.",947548800,22,453,4.114942528735632
7905352,4,B000009CE0,"I remember where I was when Harry died and how sad my sister was on hearing the news. It was then I began lessoning to his music and been a fan ever from that day. This DVD is of his early works but having never seen  him on TV, placed a face against the music. Worth a viewing to any fan.",943833600,6,289,3.737704918032787
