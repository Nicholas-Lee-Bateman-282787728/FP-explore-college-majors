3556839,5,B001EOQV9K,We bought PS3 last year and I love Christmas movies so this set was a great way to start out our Blu-Ray DVD Christmas collection.,1229904000,,130,4.24
3556840,3,B001EOQV9K,"One of these days I'm going to remember to stay away from bundled movie sets as the picture quality often seems to be lower with them. I already had each of the excellent titles in this bundle, but in DVD format. I thought it would be nice to updgade to blu ray. Last night I sat down and compared each blue ray disk in this bundle with my original dvd (upconverting of course.)

Each blu ray disk in this set does indeed look better than my older upconverted dvd disks. The colors are better and the images have more detail. That being said, all of the disks in the Christmas bundle lack the ""wow"" factor of some other blu ray titles (e.g. How the West was Won, The Wild Bunch, Nightmare Before Christmas, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.) These disks do not stand out in image quality, and given the hefty price tag, that is somewhat disappointing.

To make a long story short, this set is worth buying if you DO NOT own the movies already. If you do, it may be worth just upconverting your standard DVDs. Maybe when the titles are released individually on blu ray, they will contain more impressive picture quality.

On a more positive note, at least Warner Brothers did away with the annoying animated menus.",1225324800,60,1207,4.452488687782806
3556841,5,B001EOQV9K,All our favorite Christmas movies on blu ray all in one spot!  Love all 4 of these movies and really like how compact the disc holder is.

3556877,5,B001EOQV9K,"Oh the joy of Christmas!
Nothing brings it into perspective quite like getting warm, and cozy with some egg nog, and watching holiday movies!

With this bundle Priced at around $12.00 you can't beat it.

4 Classics (Polar Express not the greatest throw in, but it works.)

If you price each of these DVD's individually you'll find them at $10 a piece, and the blu rays may be around the same price or higher.

This was a great deal.
If you're concerned about packaging:
****THE BLU RAYS ARE ALL IN 4 INDIVIDUAL SLIM CASES WITH NO INSERTS*****

outside of this, for the price, and quantity you're getting a great deal.

I've had a few hiccups on each blu ray, which may be due from the converting standpoint, but also could be an issue with the firmware on my blu ray player.

All in all the playback is only hindered slightly and intermittently.
There have been no patterns just a couple of hiccups during playback.
The movies all keep progressing forward.

Excellent deal!

Thanks,

Now a REAL Holiday Collection would, and to be clear here, a Christmas Holiday Collection, would include ""A Christmas Story"", the animated ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" featuring Boris Karloff doing narration, ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"", ""It's A Wonderful Life"", and ""A Christmas Carol"" featuring George C. Scott.

3556884,3,B001EOQV9K,"Great movies but this title is misleading.  It says it is a Holiday collection and the only holiday on it is Christmas.  If it is a holiday collection, it should have more than just Christmas on it.  This Blu ray would be better titled Christmas Holiday Collection.  If you want me to buy your products, please title them better.",1417996800,,329,4.52542372881356
3556885,5,B001EOQV9K,"As you read through some of these reviews, you'll see some complaints about the Blu-ray transfers not being very good. I'll leave that issue to the experts (and if you Google around, you'll find that many experts do in fact share the sentiment that these Blu-ray transfers are not very good). But what I will address is the comment I've seen that points to the fact that these movies are in a multi-pack as the reason the Blu-ray transfers are not very good: this may be true, but it seems doubtful in light of the fact that, as well as I can tell, the contents of these Blu-ray discs are identical to the contents of the individually released Blu-rays. It's possible that these come from a different mastering process (which may or may not be the right term when it comes to making Blu-rays; I have no idea) but it stands to reason that this is simply a packaging up of the same exact Blu-ray discs you can buy individually. All this is to say that I don't think you should go off buying the individual Blu-ray releases hoping for better quality than you'll get here (now, some of these movies have newer special edition Blu-ray releases and those might be better, I have no idea). That said, until very recently it was actually less expensive here on Amazon to buy the individual Blu-ray releases separately than it was to buy this multi-pack and even at the time of this writing, the price difference is less than $1 in total for buying all 4 titles individually versus buying this multi-pack so there's little compelling reason to buy this set here (though I got it elsewhere for a tad less).

All that said, I give it 5 stars because it's a collection of 4 of the best Christmas movies of all time. Generally multi-title collections contain at least one stinker but not this one! You'll see advice that says that if you have these titles on DVD, don't buy this set and I won't begin to counter that advice--but I didn't have any of these titles so for me, this set was great (though again, only at the pricing I found elsewhere).",1417824000,5,2034,4.482479784366577

3556918,3,B001EOQV9K,"So far we've watched 3 of the 4 movies in this collection: Polar Express had a great picture but the sound was so low we had to turn up the surround sound receiver to over half (usually run about a quarter way up) to even hear the soundtrack. Christmas Vacation had an OK picture but not much better than the DVD. Christmas Story was very grainy in parts, especially the dark scenes. Sound was mostly in mono, not surround.

We've yet to watch Elf and hoping the blu-ray copy is better than the other 3. Although these are some of our favorite Christmas movies, the move to blu-ray so far has been a waste of money since we already had these movies on DVD with almost as good a picture and definitely better sound. I'm wondering if the individual packages would have been better blu-ray transfers. If not, why do they even bother to release in blu-ray if there's really no improvement over DVD?",1293235200,14,894,4.451219512195122

3556925,4,B001EOQV9K,"I was really looking forward to watching Christmas Vacation in Blu-Ray with DTS HD or Dolby 5.1 but got neither.. :(  Still happy I got it, didn't have any of the titles in this bundle yet.",1261872000,,189,4.25
3556926,5,B001EOQV9K,"Every bluray owner should have these in their collection. All are classics.
They are in very thin individual cases, not like other bluray cases but have a box that they all go into.
Amazon is the place to buy too. Check other prices and you'll see.",1261267200,,248,4.413043478260869
3556927,5,B001EOQV9K,"The title basically says it all. I had a couple of these already in the regular old DVD format. Decided to expand the collection, and upgrade a bit.

Like some of the other reviewers say, the quality is not top of the line. BUT, if you do not own these or are looking to expand your Blu-Ray collection this is definitely the way to go.

Better than DVD quality and four of the best Christmas movies around! For an added bonus the girlfriend approved!!! Can't go wrong with that!

Well, that's all I've got to say about the Essential Holiday Collection (The Polar Express / National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation / Elf / A Christmas Story) [Blu-ray]",1259798400,,647,4.560344827586207
3556928,4,B001EOQV9K,"Add these 4 modern classics to 'The Big 3' (It's A, Miracle, Christmas Carol) and keep your Charlie Brown, Rudolf and Grinch on regular DVD, and you have the essential Christmas movie collection. Iron Man director Jon Favreau hits gold with Elf, Robert Zemeckis rules on Polar Express, Chevy is fantastic as always in Christmas Vacation, and Christmas Story has become its own classic. Other good ones: The Family Stone, The Family Man, Deck The Halls, Home Alone, Bishop's Wife, Patrick Stewart's Christmas Carol, Muppet Christmas Carol, Emmett Otter's Jugband Christmas, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, and The Gathering (if you can find it, on VHS).

Revised: After receiving, might be noted, the 4 discs come in slim-line blu-ray cases, not full size - might matter to some.",1258416000,2,777,5.023255813953488
