8236168,2,B000ZOSMTM,"Rather than let us see a little black on either side, the makers of this disc felt the need to stretch the videos from their original 4:3 aspect ration to a modern 16:9.  The result is what can only be called a big MESS.  I'm going to hang onto the disc but only because of the one or two rarities it contains.  It will be gone as soon I have properly formatted versions of all the videos.  I definitely don't recommend this unless you just can't live without a video that is unavailable elsewhere.",1341360000,2,498,4.26595744680851
