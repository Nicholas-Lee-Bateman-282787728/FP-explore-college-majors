8146554,2,B000INBG9I,I was extremely disappointed with this CD.  The entire content of this movie is described on the cover.  I was expecting a great heart felt story; and not a very brief encounter of 2 men from different sides of the globe. 15 minutes could have been made into an excellent 2 hour inspiring tale.,1213747200,9,294,4.425925925925926
8146555,2,B000INBG9I,"I expected a feature-length film on some aspect of the Hungarian Revolution, a piece of history brought to life.  God love the ""film"" makers--instead I paid full price for a 16-minute indy (!) scene made in the Midwest.  I applaud the sentiments but tossed the DVD.",1187740800,10,265,4.739130434782608
