7865002,5,6304203918,This movie is even better now than how I remembered it back when I saw it in a theater.  Greatly underappreciated and multi-layered.  I'm so glad I have a copy even if it's only on VHS.,1511827200,,185,4.111111111111111

7865004,5,6304203918,"One of my top five (four? three? two?) films of all time.  Cinematically lush and evocative.... Provocative, sensual and painting characters with a richness that allows the viewer to connect and empathize (quite a trick with character ranging from man-hating lesbian to old world old man autocrat).  Watch it.",1199232000,,309,5.285714285714286
7865005,4,6304203918,"Sammy and Rosie are a married couple with modern ideas about open marriage, which lead eventually to jealousy and hostility. Meanwhile, London, where they live, is racked with social upheaval involving the poor and racism. Sammy's father, an old-world Pakistani, comes to visit bringng the old-world tradition with him, which doesn't help matters much. The movie is very surreal and thus hard to follow at times. Everyone is looking for love and forgiveness, though there doesn't seem to be much of either left to give. Very bleak and grim.",1112140800,,540,5.078651685393258
