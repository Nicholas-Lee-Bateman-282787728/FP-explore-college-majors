8026066,4,B0002C818Y,"This is a vhs adaptation one of Jack London's well kept secret short stories.
Usually the movie falls short of the written word but John Candy does a great job
in this and the movie lives up to the novella.  You'll feel the anguish and seem like
you're there in the Alaska sub cold, inside a cabin - and you'll understand cabin fever,
as well as gold fever.  You'll understand man's desire to strive for justice.",1363737600,,412,4.407894736842105
