3948084,5,B002LGJBXI,"The episode on french onion soup is so informative, I had to set up a small flat screen in my kitchen so I could cook while watching the master at work.

I swear to you, the french onion soup is to die for!",1333497600,,206,3.7906976744186047
3948085,5,B002LGJBXI,"I have been a fan of Julia Child since she published her first book ""The French Chef"" of which I purchased and has been well used. It was my absolute delight to be able to purchase her television series. Especially because I can pause and replay various features. Added to my delight is an additional DVD<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-French-Chef-with-Julia-Child-6-DVD-Set/dp/B002IF7PDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The French Chef with Julia Child (6 DVD Set)</a>&nbsp;of Julia's life from childhood to her death. I would recommend this collection to anyone.",1302307200,,601,6.432098765432099
3948086,5,B002LGJBXI,"I received this DVD set quickly and in perfect conditions.  The DVDs clearly looked brand new as advertised, and the whole process was flawless.",1299542400,,144,5.0
3948087,5,B002LGJBXI,"I loved watching ""The French Chef"" when it was on TV and I'm thrilled to be able to watch the episodes any time I want.  Julia Child will always be the premier cooking teacher.  I love cooking because of her shows.  She really taught us ""how"" to cook, not just assemble components and slap them all together.  I heartily recommend these DVD's.  You'll treasure them as much as I do.",1288656000,2,382,4.4
3948088,5,B002LGJBXI,"First things first: This is actually a NINE (9) disc set, because the separate single disc included with this set (Julia & Paul's history) is actually already included in one of the 3-disc packages. Not a problem - I am gifting it!

I do NOT know how to cook. I inquired at our local vocational school to take a ""prep"" class (to learn how to cut food but NOT my fingers), but it was extremely expensive. The movie ""Julie & Julia"" sparked my interest in finding out more about Julia Child. My husband and I compromised by ordering these DVD's.

Well, I am proud to say that not only have I cooked the chicken ""stew"" (coco van/friccasse - spelling?) but I am not as ""scared"" to cook anymore.

I wish I had met Ms. Child while she was still alive. These DVD's really show her humor and ability to make mistakes and not take them seriously. She is ALWAYS smiling, speaking exactly what is going on in her brain as she is preparing any of the dishes, and overall just a great instructor.

Some of the episodes are in black & white, and some are in color. They are the original episodes, so it just depends on when they were originally shot.

I may not cook my way through both volumes of her cookbook, but my husband will be coming home to some yummy food.

I highly recommend this DVD set. Bon apptit!",1279238400,20,1297,4.316872427983539
3948089,5,B002LGJBXI,"I was a young teenager when Julia Child first appeared on TV in the early 1960s.  I had always enjoyed cooking even as a child, but Julia introduced me to a world I could never have imagined from my mother's kitchen.  She introduced me to real, serious, good food and cooking and thereby enhanced all the rest of my life.  I bought this series just to watch again and refresh my memory.  I consider her one of my most positive and lasting influences, someone whose teaching and especially attitude toward food I apply nearly every day in my own kitchen. I still have my copy of her first edition Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and the recipes are still wonderful, even if I adjust them a little to reduce the fat.",1268179200,14,719,4.424242424242424

8373050,5,B002LGJBXI,Julia Child is both delightful and instructive.  Her early shows are as relevant today as when they were produced.  She enjoys the subject as wants you to enjoy it too.  She wants to pass on her experience and not impress you with how good she is.,1453420800,,247,4.326086956521739
8373051,5,B002LGJBXI,"Fantastic. She reminds us that great food is simple and quick if you are organized. I wish i had seen her programs years ago. But , better late than never. So....if you are thinking of getting a copy, just do it. Life is too short to eat mediocre food.",1445817600,,252,4.163265306122449

8373054,5,B002LGJBXI,"There's so many things to love about this DVD set; if you're a ""Julia"" fan it'll make your day! As others have stated, there's an extra DVD w/ highlights of her life and career, why not share with a friend or family member? Or use it as a loaner. Not only is this collection a class on DVD, the cookbook ""From Julia Child's Kitchen shares her personal memoirs of filming these shows and provides the companion recipes for the shows done in color. They just go together to create one of the most accessible, humorous & quality learning experiences ever. Also, if you're of a certain age, these shows will remind you of your childhood, watching your mom cook and possibly even your grandmother. For wintry, rainy NW days, snuggle up and have a good laugh; then get out your apron & try something new. You can't beat it!",1384473600,,817,4.489932885906041
8373055,5,B002LGJBXI,The ultimate Julia indulgence. We've been watching one of these each night while we eat dinner and we end up laughing every time. The bonus of course is that one learns many cooking techniques while having fun along the way. Can't recommend this set highly enough - Julia is the absolute best.,1377907200,,293,4.653846153846154
8373056,5,B002LGJBXI,I bought this collection for my son for Christmas. He loves it to say the least! Anyone liking Julia's cooking and humor will want this collection.,1357344000,,147,4.6923076923076925
