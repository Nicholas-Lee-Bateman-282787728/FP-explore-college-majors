8558392,4,B00AWHDF44,"It's a fun action packed series filled with interesting characters, but it really forces down your throat that certain actions lead to butterfly effect consequences, which is a little tiring when you see the younger characters do something that they think is helping but actually makes things worse especially when they are up against a criminal mastermind whose strategic thinking and unflappable attitude is on par with Sosuke Aizen of Bleach, Madara Uchiha of Naruto, and Donquixote Doflamingo of One Piece.",1396828800,,510,5.308641975308642

8558394,5,B00AWHDF44,"Kaijudo: Rise of the Duel Masters - Dragonstake is about a 14 year old middle school student named Ray and his adventures with his friends Ali and Gabe. Together they train in the ancient art of Kaijudo. This is a fighting martial art that summons creatures from another dimension.

This disc contains journeys that take Ray and his friends to the other side of the vail, a wall of energy that separates creature kind and humans. From deep into the heart of the volcanic fire civilization to the mystical and luminous cities of the light civilization, together they have to remain strong.

Ray, Ali and Gabe with training and strength have to do whatever it takes to defeat the Choten, an evil master mind that wishes to enslave all of creature kind under human control.

This disc does not go in order sequential order, there are episodes in between that are missing in this series. Kaijudo is a work of visual art and the special effectsare phenomenal. My 13 and 10 year old sons are hooked on this series.",1367280000,,1008,4.620111731843576
