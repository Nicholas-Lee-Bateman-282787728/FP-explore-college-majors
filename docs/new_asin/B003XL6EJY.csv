4217095,2,B003XL6EJY,"story line, not great. artwork, AWFUL. anyone who says the artwork is great is also a fan of the current crap in comics now. I stopped reading them because the art work is horrible now. I generally look forward to things being released but I see now I have to review EVERY item before purchasing. I expected art to be like every other movie (avengers, dr. strange) but this was a waste. not to give the story away but there was twist at the end. it still doesn't make up for the fact I rolled my eyes the same way as star trek 5 and said (outloud in the theater) oh kill me now. hopefully marvel will not make a habit of this but I'm not holding my breath. black panther was the same type of art. I can see my days of watching the comic books on dvd is coming to an end",1297123200,2,769,4.0
4217096,5,B003XL6EJY,"Despite the negative reviews from the 2 people who failed to do research to what a motion comic is, this is a good dvd for any Marvel fan & any big fan of Iron Man, they animation was done quite well & I'm looking forward to future Marvel motion comic dvd releases",1296000000,5,264,4.096153846153846
4217097,2,B003XL6EJY,"I have purchased various videos (DVD and Bluray) in both Marvel and DC, and hit disappointments in both.

For this one, I was looking forward to the great animation of the prior movies, but this fell way short, with scenes of people with only their mouths and an arm, that moved, or a still that zoomed in and out.

This is the first motion comic I have bought, and now will wait until I see the reviews before I will purchase again.

Shame on Marvel for cheating their fans.",1294617600,4,475,4.314606741573034
4217098,1,B003XL6EJY,"If you are expecting a comic book with little motion, then this is what you will get. It is no better than watching a picture moving back and forth. It is not a cartoon, it is not a movie. Very disappointing.",1294531200,6,208,4.097560975609756
4217099,5,B003XL6EJY,"This is not for kids, but as far as story, suspense and action this is definitely worth having in your collection. The character development is great and the story is interesting and keeps you riveted to how it unfolds. Very often when new animated video show up they lack plausibility, consistency with the character, enough action to keep you involved as well as a good enough story to maintain your interest. This story does not have this problem. I highly recommend it. It is the true comic fans as I said initially, not for kids. You will enjoy. I am now a fan of the motion comics genre.",1292457600,10,593,4.5
4217100,4,B003XL6EJY,"I was really pleased with this DVD. The imagery was great, the animation (though not traditional) brought the story to life, and the actors not only fit the part, but gave a nice sense of reality and nuance to the characters. This is not in-your-face-over-acted-Saturday Morning Cartoons. And this is not for kids. It feels much more adult than any ""super hero"" animation out there, much more like a movie. Marvel has taken their comics seriously, and so did everyone else involved in bringing this motion comic together.

Hopefully Marvel will keep this up, and we'll see more of their best series given this treatment. As a fan of animation, it's great to see something new. As a fan of comics, it's great to see the original material shown in a new way. Instead of a watered-down version of how the characters are illustrated, it's the real image. Instead of other writers taking the original ideas and re-writing them, it's the original script. The result, a fresh and unique experience.

Hope to see more!",1291766400,10,1010,4.7988505747126435
4217101,4,B003XL6EJY,"This Iron Man DVD is a ""motion comic"" from Marvel Knights. They have taken the Extremis comic and turned it into a quasi-animated movie in six episodes. Before you discount this style of animation, note that the artwork is far superior to any of the other Marvel/DC ""animated movies"" (which all seem to look like slightly better versions of Cartoon Network cartoons) because it utilizes Adi Granov's original artwork with CGI enhancements of most of the tech and action scenes. The animation is fluid, and after only a few minutes you won't even realize you're not watching a fully-animated Marvel movie.

The strength of this DVD is Warren Ellis' storyline, which is more compelling than any recent comic book movie, except for perhaps The Dark Knight and the first Iron Man movie. This motion comic is unpredictable, hard-core, and exciting.

My only complaint about this DVD was N. Ronald Levine, who voiced the character of hippie Sal Kennedy - what a horrible casting choice! The scenes with Levine take you right out of the movie as you roll your eyes at the bad acting. Luckily, he's not in the movie much except for one scene in the middle.

If you're like me, every time you buy one of these Marvel or DC animated movies, you look at the cover art and eagerly hope that the product itself utilizes that same level of artistic expertise, only to discover that it's another Cartoon Network-looking piece of crap. But with Iron Man: Extremis, you finally get to see a full story with top-notch painted animation - and it's worth it!

I'm glad I gave this product a chance...and you will be too.",1291507200,30,1600,4.724014336917563
4217102,3,B003XL6EJY,"Perhpas my disappointment extends from my high expectations that this was supposed to be some great, fantastic story which I felt was good but not great or perhaps it's because the stark (get it?) art direction, devoid of full cinematic feeling doesn't translate well here especially in the motion comic format or perhaps it's because the animation company doing the motion comics for Marvel hadn't hit their stride yet...or maybe a combination of all three...but whatever it was the net effect of this entertainment left me feeling cold.

The storyline for Extremis in a nutshell is it's an injection, like a virus, that takes over a human host and turns them into an incredibly powerful living weapon.  It's another variation of the oft attempted super-soldier serum.  Tony Stark tries to clean up the mess after it's successfully applied to a human trial, but the human is a bit unhinged.  Weaving through the story are threads about Stark being called to task as this utopian who makes and sells weapons (the hypocritical bashnick) and a techno-babble futurist talking head that looks like Jerry Garcia from the Grateful Dead who just techno-psycho-babbles.  It was annoying.

Anyway, for anyone not familiar with motion comics I would urge them to start elsewhere for a variety of reasons.  Start with Astonishing X-Men: Gifted or Thor & Loki: Blood Brothers.  If you start with Extremis you may become extremely opinionated against motion comics and you'd miss some potentially enjoyable stuff.",1360800000,,1500,5.118852459016393
4217103,4,B003XL6EJY,"I'm a 30 something female who has little interest in comics but had a chance to watch this for free. The story didn't pick up until third episode. Art is at a very high level but minus 1 because it was somewhat depressing and far too violent (two decapitations). Overall this is //not// a feel good kid's animation like ""Batman The Animated Series.""",1356393600,2,349,4.555555555555555
4217104,5,B003XL6EJY,"It had been a very, very long time since I took the time to enjoy anything comic, outside of some of the movies being made about particular ones. If you are wondering if you should make the purchase, please hesitate no longer. My interest in Iron Man: Extremis came as a result of seeing the motion comic on iTunes, and the phrase ""motion comic"" was instantly new to me. What I didn't know at the time was that what you see in the motion comic comes directly from the pages of the graphic novel 'Iron Man: Extremis,' and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE the graphic novel FIRST! That way, reading the fantastic work of Warren Ellis & seeing the exquisite artwork of Adi Granov prepares for THE EXPERIENCE of what this particular motion comic does in setting the bar for others that would follow. Motion comics are comic books or graphic novels that were not originally intended for animation, and attempts to bring it to an audience ""live"" through the motions normally created through the traditional medium of animation. Certainly, the story and artwork are undoubtedly a powerful combination I have rarely witnessed. The interview with artist Adi Granov on this DVD explains it beautifully. At the time, I could not recall where I enjoyed a storyline and artwork together more. While not required, reading the particular motion comic's comic books or graphic novel first before viewing the motion comic, helps you to better appreciate the level of talent it takes to successfully translate one medium to one never planned nor purposed for animation, but still brings it better than most animations that are made simply for animation.",1355616000,,1634,4.881294964028777
4217105,3,B003XL6EJY,"Not a big fan of this style of animation.  I actually bought this movie at a store and not from Amazon. There is nothing on the packaging that identifies it is a ""motion comic"".  I probably would have bought it anyway, just to see what it was like, but after seeing it, not a fan.

The story itself was very dark.  Definitely not kid friendly.",1348358400,,343,4.230769230769231
4217106,3,B003XL6EJY,"I always liked comics, but motion comics add music and sound effects, which are hard to get from reading a comic.  Motion comics also have some fairly nice voice acting sometimes, but Extremis is not a good example.  I found most of the acting in this fairly weak.  That said, the writing did not allow much room for emotional acting. Everything was centered on violence and action, which would be fine with me if it was more animated and had the nice eye candy to match.

Extremis is not animated well, but as far as motion comics are concerned, it is above average.  The story is from a 2004 comic, and it is more like an end-game situation than a continuing story.  Once you see the end of this, you will wonder if they made Iron Man too powerful.  While the final boss battle is pretty epic, I think this story would be hard to keep going in an interesting way.  My biggest complaint would be that the story is broken down into extremely short videos or episodes.  It would be more enjoyable if I didn't have to watch the intro credits animation every few minutes, and that intro is extremely long for how short the episodes are. The amount of people involved in this is crazy!

Pros of Extremis:
1. Iron Man is awesome.
2. The comic art is beautiful.
3. The music is pretty good.
4. The story allows a lot of violence.
5. The story wraps up nicely.

Cons of Extremis:
1. Iron Man whines about his own technology too much.
2. The animations are very ugly most of the time.
3. Nowhere near as good as the Astonishing X-Men animations!
4. The intro is extremely long and annoyingly repetitive.
5. The overall plot makes very little sense. (Hard to go into detail without spoilers.)",1339545600,,1683,4.431818181818182
4217107,3,B003XL6EJY,"I was huge fan of the Extremis comic, so when I heard they were making a motion comic of it, I was intrigued. Sadly, I was a little disappointed in what I saw. I absolutely loved the art style that was used, it's some of the most realistic stuff I've seen for this particular medium. The story was pretty good, though I don't think Extremis lends itself to the format very well as there's a lot of ""heavy"" dialogue throughout, so I think it's definitely better when read as a standard comic. About the only thing that really put a damper on this was the acting. The performances are stiff and lifeless. You can almost feel the actors reading from cue cards, which kind of hurts the whole story because there's little to no emotion put into what's being said.

So all in all, a decent watch, but nothing special. If you want to fully enjoy the Extremis story, I'd stick to the comic.",1338076800,,882,4.378048780487805
4217108,4,B003XL6EJY,"This was Iron Man like I have never seen him. Just a gritty down and dirty adventure for the Armored Warrior. I can say this is not your Grandfather's Old Shellhead, that's for sure. I was riveted by this little saga. Spoiler alert: ok not really, but this movie may help you understand Iron Man 3 a little better. Heck, i recommend watching this DVD before or after the 2013 theatre picture, all you IM fans out there.",1337126400,,419,4.384615384615385
4217109,4,B003XL6EJY,"It was a good story and good animation. I do believe that Thor and Loki (Blood brothers) and Astonishing Xmen (Gifted) were superior to this one. That does not mean that Iron Man Extremis was bad. I enjoyed it very much and hope to see more of these in the future. Do not be put off by the negative reviewers. If I paid attention to the negative reviews (which I almost did) then I would never have discovered this wonderful new thing. Try one with an open mind and not with a preconceived notion. You can get them used or new here on amazon for a reasonable price. I almost always buy used ones and I have had absolutely no problems. Remember that these are not animated or cartoon movies. These are animated graphic novels with video game like graphics. They are not the ""digital comic books"" where there is no movement with just voice overs. These have movement and plenty of action. I would like for them to get a little more in depth and longer but I believe that will come when this medium becomes more accepted.",1337040000,,1018,4.391534391534392

4217112,1,B003XL6EJY,"i don't understand how someone could enjoy watching an animated movie that basically is the same as sitting there and flipping the pages to see the characters moving in slow motion.  the graphics is terrible because the images of the characters is disproportionate and rough making them seem as though they were drawn by amateurs.  i wasted my money buying this and will avoid any of the same type of animated movies by the same ""artists"".  to summarize this up in the most direct way...my kids who love and are always glued to watching animated movies fell ASLEEP after 5 minutes from the start of the 1st episode.",1311811200,2,615,4.675925925925926

4217114,4,B003XL6EJY,"It's not your typical animated feature.  It's adult themed (more than a little gore, killing, etc)  Having read Extremis, it's very true to the original material.  It's not truly 'animated', but more of a 'moving comic'.  It's difficult to compare this to recent DC and Marvel releases - mainly because of the stylistic differences.  All in all, I enjoyed it.",1308355200,,359,4.916666666666667
4217115,5,B003XL6EJY,"Wasn't sure how this was going to look when I decided to order it.  Had visions of the old Spiderman cartoon I watched when I was a kid, and don't get me wrong... I loved that show, but this was better than a lot of animation that's out there.  I've read the comic's story arc, and thought it was one of the better out there.  The animation and voice acting were spot on, and did a great job of bringing the whole thing to life.  I'm looking forward to more.",1303603200,2,458,4.055555555555555
4217116,3,B003XL6EJY,"The Extremis story comprises the first six issues of the 4th Iron Man Series. Basically, you could say it was the beginning to a mini reboot of the Iron Man franchise back in 2004. Interestly enough, the Extremis story is still relevant today. That said, I really enjoyed Warren Ellis' story. In fact, I wish he would have remained the writer for Iron Man beyond these six issues. This ""motion"" comic version (BE VERY AWARE THAT THIS IS NOT A FULLY ACTION-ANIMATED FILM) doesn't really add much to the comic other than you don't have to read it and the fact that it costs less than the graphic novel. Yes. The art is good. This was true in the comic as well. Being familiar with the story, which is basically Iron Man's response to a very formidable (nanotech-enhanced), yet shallowly motivated villain, I found that this motion comic does do the story justice. It does seem a little slow to develop in the beginning, but finishes strongly. This was the first time I had ever watched a motion comic. I think I prefer reading the story myself.",1302134400,2,1042,4.577540106951871
4217117,4,B003XL6EJY,"While I purchased Iron Man: Extremis on iTunes awhile back, I purchased this DVD so I could watch it on my large HD TV. Wow, what a difference. Remember, this is a motion comic, not a typical animated feature. I have purchased all of Marvel's and DC's motion comics and this one is the one to beat. The animation is incredible; so detailed. The story is very good, too along with the voice acting. I love Spider-Woman: Agent of Sword too but the voice acting suffers on that one. Also there is no lip synching. Only the X-Men and this one have lip synching. I hope they do more of this kind of entertainment. This is not for children.
I knock it one star as I wish you could view it as one long movie instead of breaking it up into episodes. It's broken up like the comic but there should be an option to view it straight through. That's what DVDs are for - over, let's say, buying it digitally such as on iTunes. Another thing is the audio is compressed at 192 kilobits. DVDs allow 448 kilobits max. Maybe with all the extras, there wasn't enough room.
For $8.99, this is totally worth it.",1301356800,2,1090,4.296116504854369
4217118,1,B003XL6EJY,"Iron Man - Extremis is the most awful cartoon I ever watched. I got through the first episode without having a clue about what was going on. The story line is non-existent. It's just a bunch of mindless drivel. It's BORING and it makes no sense. I only made it halfway through the second episode before I turned it off. Unfortunately, this movie makes me question the entire Marvel Knights series..... How could anything involving Iron Man be so bad? That's the question I was left to ask.",1300579200,,489,4.568181818181818
4217119,5,B003XL6EJY,"As an adult going on 50 years of comic book enjoyment this was a real treat.  Great artwork, acting, and a story line that was up there with the best despite being somewhat lacking in the mystery department. That last comment may be somewhat unfair as these are not meant to be mysteries and Tony Stark doesn't play detective a la the Caped Crusader. It's just  my way of thinking; if there's going to be a ""who done it?"" aspect to a story it is fair to offer a critique of that aspect as well...
Definitely a worthy effort and I am not one to throw 5 Stars at something that didn't earn it.  I'd highly recommend this to any action comic lover, no pun intended!",1299456000,3,662,4.238095238095238

I can see why the gritty moving graphic novel style did not get a more broad viewing on TV.  It is not your Super Friends bowl of sugary pops.  This was an experiment for me that went quite right! Too bad there wasn't more!  If you have not seen this, buy it anyway! Iron Man has never been my favorite character. But this is one of the best adventures I never herd anything about. All the better. You know, it does not matter how old a film is. If you have not seen it, it is brand new!  If you like Marvel, you will love all the slightly twisted, hauntingly wicked, super scientific, out of control, back to the wall, blood sweat and tears this little epic has waiting for you.

8408257,5,B003XL6EJY,"Motion comics have been around for a good while now.  One of the most interesting from the past was The Maxx, which used the limited animation as a sort of style.  This Iron Man film is interesting because they were able to maintain that comic feel but they went to extra steps to pace it more like a film.  I also like how the rendered 3D parts are all skinned to look just like the book.  It blends a lot  better then you would imagine.  It's funny the animation is actually better then the more recent Marvel Knights releases.  A lot of it probably has to do with how it was drawn and the art transitioning to motion a lot better.  It looks clean though with no jagged edges and lip syncing is smooth.

The voice acting is good and of course so is the story.  It's interesting to watch in wake of the Iron Man film series.  You can see that almost all the key moments in those films came from this storyline.  It's hard to imagine this is one of Marvel's first motion comics.  My major complaint is the DVD itself.  On the new releases everything has chapters, this doesn't.  You have to fast forward the 30 second intro every episode which is a little annoying.  The special features are okay but a little long.  I feel like they could have cut the interview with the artist down a bit.  He was humble at first but as it went on he started to sound pretentious.  I'm sure he's not but when you ask someone to talk up their own work it's hard not to look like that.

In my opinion, this is a must see for any fan of Iron Man, and is an excellent production of a Marvel hero and story.

Think a bit of ""The Dark Knight""'s real-world sobriety spliced onto the high-tech frenzy of this one.
