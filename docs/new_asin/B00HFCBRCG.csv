8632419,4,B00HFCBRCG,"Note: This is the season connector between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Galaxy-Railways-Complete-Series/dp/B00HFCBRCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Galaxy Railways: Complete Series</a>&nbsp;and a second season not yet released here.

This OVA series gives an origin to a new character in The Galaxy Railways series, besides tying the two series (The Galaxy Railways and Galaxy Express 999) together.  Despite doing a better job than I at first realized this is still a time travel adventure (mess) so it will be a struggle and of no use except to fans of either series.  Basically, Sirius Platoon of the Galaxy Railways is sent to investigate some mysterious appearances in space while at the same time the Galaxy Express 999 is pulled down onto the mysterious planet Herise, leaving Mr. Conductor, Tetsuro, and Maetel stranded.  Soon our heroes meet and solve (?) the mystery.

Note: This show is only subtitled in English. There is no English voice dubbing.

Note: If you want a better and somewhat more realistic (well, in comparison to this!) railroad themed show, I would recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rail-Wars/dp/B019KDX8MO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rail Wars!</a>.",1491955200,2,1279,6.450292397660819
8632420,4,B00HFCBRCG,"While he is not my absolute favorite, I have enjoyed a lot of the work of creator Leiji Matsumoto (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-Harlock-Complete-TV-Series/dp/B00DELKA2U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain Harlock Complete TV Series</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gun-Frontier-Complete-Collection/dp/B01MDNDZ1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gun Frontier Complete Collection</a>, not to mention long pieces of other series watched on TV) so I know what to look for: heroes facing impossible odds on long journeys against monstrous enemies using scientifically advanced but ludicrous looking technologies (ship's wheels, sterncastles, battle flags in space, and, my personal favorite, trains as spaceships), or at least I thought I did.  However, this series somewhat disappointed me by being without a central enemy for most of its run.

Perhaps because of this lack of a central foe, the characterization seems a bit overdone.  For example hero Manabu Yuuki is joining the galaxy railways following the deaths in service of not only his father but also his older brother (no wonder his mother is upset!), and his partner Bruce J. Speed doesn't want a partner after having not one but three previous partners die on him.  The stories also seemed a bit loose and disconnected though some of them did surprise with elements that show up at the end.  They also over bludgeon the theme of fate IMHO.

8632422,5,B00HFCBRCG,"This is the final volume of the series involving Maetel which intersects the popular ""The Galaxy Railways"" DVD. To fully understand this story, it would be advisable to find and watch the first four volumes beginning with ""Maetel Legend"" that launches the entire series. ""Maetel Legend"" is difficult to find and often overpriced (often between $50 up to over a hundred dollars). I was lucky locating a copy for $29. This pilot story explains the origin of Maetel. It is followed by (the inexpensive trio) of  ""Galaxy Express Eternal Fantasy,"" ""Galaxy Express 999."" and ""Adieu Galaxy Express"" 999."" All four are a series of interesting stories in sequence that are well worth your time is you liked the original 24-part ""The Galaxy Railways"" released by Funimation. This DVD interacts with the original crew characters and is a great 100-minute feature.

I happened to get addicted to this entire series and later learned a second season 24-part DVD of the original ""The Galaxy Railways"" has been completed, but has not been released for sale by Funimation is the United States. Hopefully it will be sometime in the near future. (It can be seen on the website ""Anime Go Go)."" As for this DVD, the overall animation and quality of the ongoing story is excellent. Well worth you time to own the entire set if you like the basic story.

I happen to get addicted to the entire sequence",1485388800,6,1380,4.814345991561181

8632424,5,B00HFCBRCG,"Very clever story. Don't let the ""trains in space"" basic plot discourage you. It's a great series mixing comedy, drama and a little tragedy. The character development is very good and the animation is excellent. The main character (Monabu) is somewhat dense regarding his growing relationship with his attractive girlfriend (Louise). He is a strong central character! He does break of a lot of regulations and always gets into trouble, but displays incredible courage at times. The supporting characters (including the crews of two other trains) are fascinating as the 24 episode series evolves. By then end, you become very attached to the entire cast. The individual episodes are quite clever and well written.

I recently discovered a second 24-episode series has been completed, but not yet released. It can be viewed on one of the anime internet channels. This series is even better the first and uses flashbacks from the first series to keep the overall story closely tied. Hopefully, Funimation will release the second series DVD very soon. Together, they would be a must set for most anime collectors! Galaxy Railways is in my permanent Top Ten!",1444780800,2,1153,5.1005291005291005

8632426,5,B00HFCBRCG,"I found this story to be a strangely compelling tale of self-determination. Not incredibly epic or adventuresome, but full of character and social strife. More of an existential drama with strange sci-fi undertones and whimsical implausability (Steam engines in space. REALLY??). Loads of fun if you prefer more drama than action.",1426809600,4,330,5.490196078431373
8632427,5,B00HFCBRCG,I used to watch this show when it aired on the FUNimation channel on my Verizon network. Ever since they removed that channel I miss seeing great animes like this one. I had no clue till recently that Galaxy Express 999 was the OG Railways show. I will now watch that show and this.,1425600000,,282,4.2407407407407405
