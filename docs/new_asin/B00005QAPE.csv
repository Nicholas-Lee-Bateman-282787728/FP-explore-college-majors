7950261,5,B00005QAPE,"This DVD showcases how Goku fights Frieza as Namek is about to blow up. While Toei DID manage to make a 5 minute fight stretch out to 9 episodes, it is still an exciting battle to watch. The filler pretty much makes the battle more intense and exciting. In the first episode of the four episode DVD, there is an amazing moment where everyone who died comes back to life. In what I think is a filler scene, Vegeta actually comes up to Goku and Frieza. That was a spectacular scene, to see him so close to the tyrant he hated, right before he got zapped back to earth.
The fight continues on through the second episode, third, and fourth episodes. Here, Goku gets stronger and stronger as he continually shows Frieza whose boss. This fight is truly spectacular, and NOT one to be missed. Meanwhile, the people who have returned to earth settle all of their problems too. There are some intense scenes with Vegeta (well, not too intense, you'll have to wait until the next DVD for that) and it is pretty interesting. There are no extras on this DVD, but you should come to expect that from Dragon Ball Z. Anyway, buy this. It showcases a great fight and is really intense.",1074643200,3,1169,4.441860465116279
7950262,5,B00005QAPE,"I love this Dvd and the other when Goku and Fieza starts fighting.  This is the one time Goku trains to fight a powerful fighter. Every other villain fighter is like impossible to beat with ridiculous power levels and moves that are WAAAAAAAAY better than the moves of the super sayin's. Majin buu can turn them into food and take their power and moves from them by eating them and become stronger. Baby or as some people say Babie out does Majin Buu a 1000 to 1 in the dragon ball gt version. he can jump into people bodys and possess them and then jump outside them while leaving eggs or seeds in them which turns them in his slaves. and baby does that to some of he Z fighters and he takes over vegeta's body.  but is then beatin when goku of givin power by all the people in the universe or somethin like that. and then he does a power move like the kamahamah wave and then baby leaves the body of vegeta and is then destoryed.and then back in the DBZ version Galic jr. is invincible and can't be beatin and the only way he is beatin is when he is sucked into the dead zone where you can't get out. butsome how he gets out and then gets sucked back in and also Cooler who later on became a machine become impossible to beat because he can clone himself into the 1000s and the only reason why he is beatin is because he trys to take the power from Vegeta and Goku while they are super sayins and then the big Gete star overlaods and brakes because they had to much power. They Cooler fights them in his real form and then geats destoryed. and then cell who could suck peopl up through his tail and take their power from them. kinda like majin buu. All these villians could be cut in half , blown up into 1000s peices and killed all types of ways and still come back to life.  But Frieza is like the only normal villain that can't come back when he i destoryed like that. him and  super 17 , broly , androids and the of the dragons of the black dragon balls.  frieza and goku fight for what it seems like for days and that is why i like this dvd so much.",1055894400,,2056,4.104477611940299
7950263,4,B00005QAPE,"In this 4-episode DVD, you'll see Goku as a super saiyan, fight Frieza who is at his maximum power.  Towards the end Frieza has just about lost and gets very angry, but his frustration makes him fight even worse.  Definitely get this DVD!",1017705600,,238,4.511627906976744
7950264,5,B00005QAPE,"As a conclusion to the long suspensful Frieza saga it is great. This four episode set is four of the greatest episodes of Dragonball Z.  Goku the LEGENDARY SUPER SAIYAN destorying the long living, unforgivable, great evil of Frieza.  Frieza is would also be called one of the greats among evil.  Tyrants to be exact.  It is a great battle.  So suspensful and absolutely fabulous.  If I could I would give it 10 stars.  Just to prove that Dragonball Z rocks.",1007164800,2,457,4.567901234567901
