6078460,5,B00GJFX8TA,"History will prove that there will never be another Sylvester Stallone or another Arnold Schwarzenegger. These two legends have truly raisin the bar way high certainly when it comes to the action genre. Times may have changed and movie goers interest may have also changed but that does not change the fact that an actor like Sylvester Stallone has brought so much to the world of entertainment. Not only is he an actor, but he's a writer, producer and director. Seeing him and Arnold together was a blast. Escape Plan had an interesting story and was very entertaining, suspenseful, funny and a movie with great twists. Thanks Mr. Stallone & Mr. Schwarzenegger for a great movie. Totally recommended.",1390176000,6,701,4.9491525423728815
6078461,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Fast, raucous, adrenalized fun at its finest. If you're a fan of 80's style action movies, this will not disappoint.

Ray Breslin (Stallone) is a top notch security consultant that must break out of the depths of ""The Tomb"", an uberwicked security fortress/prison complete with futuristic translucent cells, a smart, sadistic warden (Jim Caviezel) and sci-fi costume inspired guards (Brit Vinnie Jones). Breslin (Stallone) teams up with another inmate, smack-talking Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and the escape of a lifetime ensues, via torture, pursuit and the usual high stakes are on the line; their lives.

The greatest fun in this movie derives from Stallone and Schwarzenegger zinging each other. Here's a small sample:
Emil Rottmayer: ""Who were you before you came in here?""
Ray Breslin: ""I break out of prisons for a living. Someone wanted this place tested.""
Emil Rottmayer: ""You don't look that smart.""
Ray Breslin: ""You don't either.""

There's plenty more where this came from and it makes you wish California hadn't hogged the big guy (Schwarzenegger) all to themselves when he did his stint as the their Gov.

Darn entertaining and Stallone's best in a while.

Enjoy!",1389916800,34,1183,5.238095238095238
6078462,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Sylvester Stallone is Ray Breslin, a man wrongly incarcerated in a top-secret prison. I should rather not tell you much about the story and his character, except that he gets a help from one of his fellow inmates Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), to escape from the jail run by a sadistic warden named Hobbes (Jim Caviezel). But Ray and Emil (and viewers) soon realize that this is the most secure prison in the world.

Escape Plan is an old-school prison-escape movie. It is fast-paced and action-packed, made with solid direction (by Mikael Hfstrm). While the basic idea of the most secure prison may be stretching credibility, it is fun nonetheless watching two stars teaming up for the big screen (though, as the story is basically about Ray, Stallones screen time is longer.)

The supporting cast includes Vincent D'Onofrio, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, Vinnie Jones, Amy Ryan and Faran Tahir. Except for Faran Tahirs role, none of the characters are fleshed out enough, especially Jackson and Ryans that are underwritten and even pointless.

So finally Stallone and Schwarzenegger are in one movie together (and not in a cameo role). Acting-wise, both stars deliver more than satisfactory performances, and there is an impressive scene where Schwarzenegger (speaking in German) shows his acting skills. And of course as an action movie Escape Plan is very enjoyable.",1389916800,63,1375,5.15695067264574
6078463,5,B00GJFX8TA,"The Good- The script is surprisingly well-written. Stallone's methods of escape are explained in intricate detail, all of which are believable and logical. Stallone is still likeable as a lead actor and as usual, you find yourself rooting for him. The action is done old school, not much in the way of CGI (with the exception of a pull away shot of the hi-tech prison). The hits are brutal and when people are shot it looks real. Jim Cavizel is great as the soulless warden of the Tomb. He shows menace without raising his voice, but using his eyes and chillingly even tone to show he is a threat. He also has some good humorous villain moments. The plot is again, surprisingly tight. Everything intertwines and is explained in equal detail as Stallone's escape methods. Schwarzenegger is great in this movie. I can't remember the last time he was so solid. Most of his jokes hit and he even shows some decent acting chops.
The BAD- '50 cent' and the blonde who play Stallone's team come right out of a B-movie with their acting. There is also no chemistry between Stallone and his group. Fortunately, they are not in the movie very much. I guess between natural aging and plastic surgery, Stallone has lost some of his facial expressions. At times, especially when he smiles, you really can't tell. Not much, but some the dialogue falls flat.
THE DEAL- This movie is a pleasant surprise. A lot of critics are incorrectly labeling it as 'dumb fun' eh, no. The Expendables is dumb fun, Escape Plan is not. While there are a few B-movie moments, this movie is a top-notch action film that will have you engaged in the story. Stallone and Schwarzenegger play off each other well and the action is in your face and realistic. Even though they are older, when Sly and Arnold slap people around you still believe it. This long awaited team-up is everything an action fan could hope for.",1389744000,221,1880,4.631736526946108
6078464,3,B00GJFX8TA,"Fun movie, based on an improbable plot, of course, but enjoyable all the same.  Good cast, and good directing and special effects.  This is an excellent ""pizza-and-beer movie"", perfect for a Friday night after a long, hard week at work.",1530403200,,236,4.875

6078516,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Almost gave it a 5**** - had a decent story - well executed - no hamming the screen - minimal F**** Bombs and especially fascinating ending ( no peeking). They have both appeared partnered together on other films but not as perfectly as this one (seems like it was made for this old time pair).
For the price it was an excellent watch - they still manage to maintain their box office charisma despite their age. There is the standard fare of violence so probably wouldn't let teens under 18 get too hyped up on this one. There will more than enough time later to be challenged by avoiding the UN-necessary bad language that always accompanies movies of this nature. All said - this movie is just a matter of lesser of two evils. - all violence and no story or some story and a little redeeming quality to ending. You be the judge.",1506988800,,830,4.396103896103896

I wouldnt call it action packed by any means but the story was decent as well as the acting.  It's cool to have sly and Arnold in movies together because they are both iconic action hero's.  There is a good scene towards the end that really pays tribute to some of the late 80's action movies that was really cool.  If you have never seen this and like action movies give this a try, I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",1476144000,,516,4.13

6078592,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape Plan
 I like this three saw blade prison break flick very much.  I like the cast a lot too.  The two headliners are Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzengger, two action actors of note.  Director Mikael Hafstrom (1408) provided a strong back up cast.  Vincent DOnofino (Law and Order) plays Stallones partner in a business that finds flaws in prison security, something that the warden in Florida needed recently.  Rapper 50 Cent is surprisingly strong in a smaller role.  We also have James Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) as a bad guy, Sam Neill and busy big screen bad man Vinnie Jones.  Jones appears in a dozen films in 2013 alone.  Poor Amy Ryan (Dan in Real Life) upholds the honor of actresses in a small but nicely crafted role in an overwhelmingly male film.
 We should mention that both Stallone and Schwarzengger had less than stellar efforts very early in 2013.  The producers hope that the pair of them together will be greater boxofficewise than each of them alone.  It seems a fair bet.  How much extra drawing power Sam Neill, 50 Cent or DOnofino will bring is an open question.  The Islamic characters are strong and charismatic.  They are also ordinary opium lords rather than religious whack jobs.  These carful distinctions might add to the take in Pakistan or Egypt.  When spending $70 million on a film starring over the hill action heroes, such considerations are important.
 You will enjoy this lavishly setted escape flick.  Stallone discovers too late that he has been betrayed.  Instead of finding a way to escape from a prison, his regular job, he is put away for good in a prison that has no escape. This prison uses the highest of high tech to keep the cons in stir forever.  The owner is some private syndicate that takes all comers.  Gang lords pay to have their rivals put on ice, not just government black ops agencies.
 Those who enjoy high concept action flicks will like this one.  The acting is much better than we usually get, ditto the writing and directing.  They spent serious money here and took the project seriously.  The attention shows.  This is an R rated film for bad language and lots of violence.  The illegal prison allows prisoners to be abused savagely, so savagely that I took offence a couple of times.  There are no naked people, and very few even clothed females.
 Escape Plan grossed some $30 million the opening weekend and has some chance of getting the backers money back.  I liked it much better than The Expendables or GI Joe but much less than Papillion or The Great Escape.  It lasts one hour and 56 minutes.
 Stallone and Arnold play it straight with the audience with no cute remarks or smart aleck winks.  If you like straight up action done very well, see this one.",1472688000,,2746,4.663883089770355

And seriously, allow the good guys to at least LOOK like they can get hurt. 8,000 bullets fly at the leads and they all miraculously hit anything BUT the heroes, meanwhile the heroes have magic guns that will fire around corners and be dead on target. This is not the 80s anymore and this movie purported to be more realistic than the old Schwarzenegger films anyway, so this is not acceptable in my opinion. And bullets do not spark, gun fire cannot make gas tank explode, and why in the flaming wide world of sports did the helicopter at the end wait 5 whole minutes to fly away instead of doing it as soon as they picked that guy up?

This movie just kind of lays there. Arnold and Sly are decently entertaining when they're talking to each other, but other than that, its a snooze.  Stallone did it better in ""Lock Up.""",1454457600,,941,4.459302325581396

6078710,4,B00GJFX8TA,"This is a good movie. I was really surprised because I paid like $3.00 for it at Wal-Mart and thought I wasn't going to really to be entertained, but since Arnold and Stallone were together on this one I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. Stallone paints a character who is pure genius and plans escapes out of prisons. All the planning was explained and I loved that and I just loved Arnold, he always plays great roles. (Spoiler Alert) My only two irritations about this film were that they didn't show how Arnold's character was able to learn about Stallone's character was coming in to plan an escape. Sure his daughter helped with that, but he was a on boat that showed no signs that prisoners were unable to communicate with the outside world. And then the second thing that bothered me was the scene where Stallone is left on the beach cause he has his own ride??? They should have just driven off together. I mean how did he get another ride? Surely, that took some time to do, probably lots of walking in fact since he didn't have a cell phone. Other than those things, the film was entertaining. Definiitely, a good movie to watch on a Saturday night with nothing to do.",1449187200,,1188,4.404545454545454

This movie is an action film that lacks depth and realism.. then again... one should have certain expectations when viewing a film with Stallone and Arnold ...

For those of you who have shut off your brain when thinking about viewing this movie.... this is an action film with lots of fighting and guns and shooting and a nonsense storyline. Its much like a pornographic film, but without the women!

This is not a film you would ever speak to anyone about after it was over... you will simply wonder what you did with that portion of your life as you go and think about better ways to live your life.",1447200000,3,690,4.333333333333333

I was thinking Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger between the two of them what makes this movie fun and exciting but the action was far few in between. It's hard to say whether or not I recommend to see this or not because if you're a fan of these characters you may want to just to see it. Just to give you a little insight about the movie it's about a man who get set up and incarcerated in the world's most secure prison and he basically is doing everything to find ways to escape with help from the outside.,1446768000,,629,4.25

Everything is done perfectly in this movie and it's just a beautiful representation of how excellent the older actors are and always have been. And the fact of having Stallone and Schwarzenneger as the two main actors in a full film together was so amazing.

There was one unfortunate scene at the end, where the bad guys shoot at a helicopter but somehow cannot seem to hit it, especially its blades. Oh well...

The most interesting aspect seems unappreciated by many. There is a Muslim character. He ultimately comes off as a sympathetic bloke. He is in prison because he was part of some gang whose exact exploits were carefully omitted. The point is that many other Muslim prisoners were suspected terrorists. The plot walks a fine line depicting him as just a criminal but not a terrorist. Akin in fact to Schwarzenegger's character.",1440288000,,738,4.857142857142857

Slynold Swartztalone(your welcome) are in the ""world's most secret and secure prison"" where doors are locked with a simple four digit code if locked at all, inmates are granted seemingly endless rec time and guards apparently refuse to do simple pat downs on prisoners ...

6078843,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Stallone plays Ray Breslin, former prosecutor, current Houdini of the prison world.  His company Breslin-Clark, co-run by CEO Lester Clark (Donofrio) and supported by tech guru Hush (Curtis Jackson) and Abigail (Amy Ryan), is hired by to test the reliability of high security prisons.  When propositioned by the CIA to test out the next stage of prisons, a top-secret, impervious prison at which the worst prisoners in the world are sent to ""disappear"", the challenge - one that carries with it a multimillion dollar payday - is to prove the new facility's capabilities before the international investors start to pump in the millions.  So Mr. Breslin, despite the best wishes of Hush and Miller and risk of prison rape, volunteers and sets this movie in motion.

A quick kidnapping via spec-ops types and Breslin is in the facility, where a sadistic warden (Caviezel) and head guard (Jones) use whatever methods they can to keep the prisoners contained.  Along with a head honcho prisoner named Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), it's up to Breslin to devise an escape plan.

This is a good prison break film.  That's really all that it is, but it's got several positives going for it.  It's plot set up is tight.  Every move by Stallone is explained very well.  Think Ocean's Eleven inside a prison.  The one part of the film I didn't enjoy, even if it was mandatory in order to make the facility truly escape proof, is the senseless killing of various guard fodder, no doubt guys who took a prison guard job with a good paycheck and lots of TDY.  Just like so many Stormtroopers, employment doesn't mean you agree with the company's executives, motives, or belief system.  Otherwise, I liked the basic character development where good guys are good and bad guys are bad, even if Caviezel was semi-unconvincing.  Finally, the action is just thick enough to keep it from being too ""how to break out of prison blueprint""-boring.

Good film.  I liked it and would watch it again.",1432598400,,1971,4.8562874251497

6078848,5,B00GJFX8TA,"ESCAPE PLAN

What a fun film, that is what is was thinking while watching this movie. The concept is great even though we have all seen prison break flicks. The look, setting and tone of this film all the way to the actors involved, everything screams fun. This is a film that is not meant to be taken seriously. It is just a cool action flick with some people we have all enjoyed over the years. It took long enough but Sly and Arnnie are staring together.

Ray Breslin [Sly] is a man who spends his life in prison, breaking out. He is hired to go in and find the flaws in the system and help to fix that problem. He is hired one day to do such a thing with a prison that is off the map, a secret location for the worst of the worst. He cant even let his team know where it is, he cant even know. So once delivered he has to start his work but something is wrong. It seems someone wanted him there and the place seems unbreakable. So he has to find a way out of an inescapable prison, and he may even need help from some of the worst of the worst to do it.

This film was directed by Mikael Hafstorm who made films like Derailed, The Rite and the Stephen King based 1408. All films I liked so I was sure I would like his work here. Also the writing team was Miles Chapman who wrote Roadhouse 2 and Jason Keller who wrote Machine Gun Preacher and the fun Mirror Mirror. I think the combination of the three worked well here. Like I said the film was fun and also clever at times. Of course we would have nothing if not for the acting, and I loved it here.

Sly Stallone is perfect here and despite what others have said I think he was great for the role. He is a gritty veteran who looks like he belongs in jail when compared to the rest of his team. All of whom are great here as well including rapper turned actor Curtis Jackson also known as 50 Cent. Then of course we have Arnold as the guy who is already in the prison wanting to get out and sees his chance with Slys character. Arnold seems to be having a lot of fun with this character as does Vinnie Jones but it is Jim Caviezel who is the scene stealer here. His character and his portrayal of him is excellent. He is the perfect type of villain and you will see what I am talking about.

The Blu-Ray/DVD combo comes with deleted scenes and behind the scenes features but it is the commentary that I enjoyed the most. I would recommend this flick to anyone who is a fan of any of these people involved or just looking for a flick on a lazy night. This is a fun flick with some fun characters and actors.",1431043200,,2562,4.055335968379446

It's a serious action movie but has many fun moments and lots of moments where both Arnold and Sly show why they were at one time the greatest action stars in the world.

6078911,5,B00GJFX8TA,"Having seen a trailer at the beginning of another film, this movie looked like a bit of fun so it was worth the very modest expenditure, if only to see Stallone and Arnie together. Neither are the greatest actors in the world but you always know what to expect; non-stop action, a simple plot, classic one-liners and lots of general silliness making a hugely entertaining film.

We were not disappointed. Stallone plays a successful prison tester, spending his life escaping to highlight flaws in security. Arnie is a long term inmate of a secret, privately funded escape proof prison where the nations most unwanted are housed. Jim Caviezel plays the warder and Vinnie Jones, surprise, surprise, is his thuggish sidekick while Stallones shifty boss is excellently played by Vincent DOnofrio. With the cast in place you have the ingredients for a cracking bit of entertainment; all that is needed is a half decent script and a director who knows how to shoehorn every action element into the approved formula and, hey presto, a very acceptable movie is born.

It was never going to win any Oscars. There are no outstanding performances, the characters are monolithic, the plot ridiculously simple and the outcome is never in doubt, but it is a great ride nonetheless. In this respect it perfectly fulfils its role; providing a splendid bit of brain-out entertainment while giving Sly and Arnie a chance to do what they do best. It is an easy film to sneer at but it doesnt pretend to do anything other than provide some real old-school classic 80s action. Splendid stuff; just open a bottle of wine, disengage those higher cognitive functions, get comfy on  the sofa on a wet Sunday afternoon and let this entertaining nonsense take the reins. Silly, indeed, but most excellent and hugely entertaining.",1422316800,,1802,4.921052631578948

6078913,4,B00GJFX8TA,"An entertaining action movie, belonging to the ""escape from prison"" sub genre, starring Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Stalone is Ray Breslin, a sort of consultant that is usually thrown (undercover) in prison to test their security in order to turn them increasingly escape-proof. One day he is asked by an apparent CIA agent to do this sort of job for a clandestine Guantanamo-type prison. Off he goes, but he soon learns this was an entrapment and the prison authorities have no intention of letting him go. In jail he becomes friends with fellow prisoner Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a German who has information on a shady financier but is unwilling to disclose it to the very interested prison authorities. Soon Breslin and Rottmayer team together to investigate what is going on, and they find (SPOILER ALERT) that they are one a huge tanker type ship in high seas, so that escape seems almost impossible. On the other hand, we know nothing is impossible in movies for Stallone and the ""Gobernator"".

Silly but fun, and well made (by Swedish director Mikael Halfstrom) for what it is. Stallone and Schwarzenegger remain credible action movie stars, despite both being in their mid sixties when they filmed this. Jim Caviezel plays the evil prison warden. Also with Sam Neill (!), a strange casting choice for an action film like this, playing the conscience troubled prison doctor.",1422144000,,1409,5.073275862068965

This movie was rated 4 stars by customers here at Amazon so I expected a far better story than what was delivered. The movie held my interest because of the interesting visuals and nice mix of characters, but the story line was very weak and left me disappointed.

To be fair, my wife watched it with me and she enjoyed it. She didn't seem to mind all the cheap tricks the writer used to ensure a successful escape at this maximum security prison.

6078954,5,B00GJFX8TA,"I have to see this movie again. I won't spoil it, but my character and personality is a lot like the protagonist's. I find Breslin to be really relatable - finding holes in the system and wanting to make the system better. I enjoyed the friendship shared between him and his sidekick (Rottmayer). The shenanigans that these two get into! Not fun at all, but I do enjoy watching Breslin buck the system - my hero.

I must say that I am a little disappointed in Jim Caviezel's choice of character for this movie. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE him on Person of Interest and the aloofness that his character exudes dazzles me. He is still somewhat cold, calculating, and aloof in this movie, but it translates horribly. I couldn't relate to him as the warden at all. He's supposed to be the hero. Even when Denzel Washington was in Training Day his evil doings were somewhat relatable and you thought that he might have been doing good (at first), somewhat like Robin Hood. I guess the difference with Washington and Caviezel is that we are somewhat acclimated to Washington switching roles in Training Day (from usually playing the hero to being a failed heroic cop), so by the end of the TD no one in the audience can sympathize with him. With Caviezel, we don't get to first like him, or even be apathetic towards him. I think his character would have been better if the audience first liked him. Our first impression of him, at least for me, was that he was not to be trusted. Despite Caviezel being poorly casted. I still love this movie and must see it again (which is rare).

Faran Tahir is the sexiest 50 year I know (of). Keep working out!

Oh, how can I forget Curtis Jackson? 50 is 50 no matter what role you put him in. I knew I would like his character from the beginning, and by the end of the film, he did not disappoint. Love him! Love this movie!",1417910400,,1848,4.39766081871345

His head looks like 25 pounds of raw mutton left out in the hot sun for days. His voice sounds like rocks in a Cuisinart. And his acting chops have actually deteriorated over the decades. At least Ahnult is clearly having fun with all the ridiculousness. They're supported by a startlingly high-profile cast. How the heck did they get Sam Neill, Jim Caviezel, Vincent D'Onofrio, Vinnie Jones and 50 Effing Cent all to play second fiddles in this prison orchestra? The story is a preposterous fantasy, but no one would expect otherwise.

6078960,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Stallone works for a small firm whose area of expertise is exposing the security weaknesses in prisons.  He is paid to incarcerate himself and figure out how to escape.  Indeed, the opening teaser sequence shows him doing just that, and being surrounded by police, only it's all part of a prearranged act.  Lo and behold, his firm is approached by someone from the CIA -- a maximum security prison has been built with state of the art technology to hold the world's most heinous criminals, and the CIA wants Stallone to check in and see if he can escape.  I won't give away the plot complications here, except that he meets and befriends Schwarzenegger in said prison and they plan an escape.  (The other prisoners seem anything but sinister, and seem to spend their time idly milling around in the main area, sort of as window dressing to the movie.)  Clearly both principals are too old to be playing these parts, and the escape methods are far-fetched to say the very least.  The script is somewhat amateurish, and there are plot holes.  The movie kind of thuds along, even during the action sequences, and never really catches fire.  And Stallone and Schwarzenegger are treated with kid gloves, never horribly abused, and hardly the worse for wear as they are in fresh makeup with each new scene.  The film is watchable and pleasant, but as written the plot just doesn't generate any tension.  It's clumsy and repetitive, as is some of the gratuitous backstory. It could have benefited greatly from some ""we're gonna get you out there, baby, just sit tight"" communication from the front office.  As a result, the surprise twist at the end seems anticlimactic.",1417305600,,1663,4.776223776223776

6078974,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Said it before: This guy is 65 years old?

Dang.

I can only hope I'm anywhere near this good at sixty-plus.

Tight action flick with veteran Stallone delivering a very solid performance as Ray Breslin - escape artist extraordinaire. One part engineer, another part architect, the remaining special forces badass - this guy would've given Houdini a serious run for his money.

Paid as a private consultant, Ray and his crew are hired to test the infamous prisons known colloquially as Super Max. These are the facilities holding the worst of the worst - the real hardcore criminals, evil freaks and dedicated fanatics. Beyond maximum, these are essentially modern fortresses; only instead of keeping out - these things are constructed to keep in.

Having successfully broken out of fourteen straight such facilities, to the embarrassment of wardens across the country, he's ready for some much needed rest and relaxation. But his partner has been approached with an offer that he believes their company cannot turn down. Double their normal $1 million dollar fee to test an off-the-grid hole. A place so secret that it's completely black. For all intents and purposes - it does not exist.

As Ray decides that two million greenbacks is just too good a payday, he agrees to the CIA's stringent terms. As long as he's allowed a ""safe code"" - the verbal key to get out - he'll take on this newest unbreakable criminal container.

Turns out that Ray doesn't realize the true game being played here.

He's not coming back because he's not getting out. Not ever.

As he realizes that something has gone horribly wrong, his skills switch gears from employed solution to real life-or-death escape. All while elements of the government, and even his own crew, conspire to stamp a one-way ticket to hell with his name on it.

There were a few weak spots.

Ironically, and most notably, in the form of strongman Schwarzenegger. The big man just did not fit the production. His role would've been much better suited for a supporting actor, not a well-known star. Always more of a customized character cut-out; as long as the film wrapped around those massive biceps, Arnold's renown charm and devilish wit smooths over the obvious fact that he has limited range and usually playing the exact same guy in every production. Just wasn't enough of the film to cover his lack of presentation.

Additionally, the entire cast were oversimplified laundry-list representatives of the clichd prison escape movie.

But the minor knocks against this flick aren't enough to derail this fun one-time ride.

Overall, entertaining and worth the price of the ticket, parking hassle, and sadly ubiquitous inconsiderate iceholes - just like the one who *had* to have her phone on during the movie.",1415836800,,2766,4.958874458874459

6078986,3,B00GJFX8TA,"I found this film watchable and I don't regret that I saw it - but having waited sooooo long for a movie in which Stallone and Schwarzenegger would appear together (for real, not just in short glimpses) I was a little bit disappointed. It was definitely not even half as good as I hoped. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Ray Breslin (Stallone) is a highly paid specialist who offers a unique kind of services - he gets incarcerated in prisons to test their security. He usually finds a lot of flaws, including in the strictest high security facilities... One day he is send to test a very, very exceptionnal place, run by a strange warden (Jim Caviezel). Once inside, he quickly realises that there is something very wrong both with this place and his own situation. He also befriends another inmate, a certain Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), who seems to be the object of particular attention from all the guards... And then the story begins.

Before going into the film itself, for once I decided to beef up my review with some bulls**t psychology, so here it is. Did you notice how often Stallone plays characters escaping or running away from something/somebody? Well, let's have a count (precision - I include only the films I saw):

- ""Rocky"" - escapes from misery and failure
- ""Paradise Alley"" - escapes from misery and failure
- ""Rocky II"" - escapes from misery and failure
- ""Escape to victory"" - escapes from a Nazi prisoner camp
- ""Rambo: the first blood"" - runs away from a redneck sheriff and the whole freaking division of National Guard
- ""Rambo II"" - escapes from Vietnam with American MIAs
- ""Cobra"" - runs away from a gang of satanistic murderers (but gets caught by his future bisexual cheating gold-digging wife...)
- ""Rambo III"" - escapes from Afghanistan
- ""Lock up"" - runs away from a high security prison run by a sadistic warden (already...)
- ""Tango and Cash"" - runs away from a high security prison run by a sadistic warden (is there a pattern here?)
- ""Cliffhanger"" - runs away from a gang of ruthless murderers AND from his past...
- ""Assassins"" - runs away from Antonio Banderas...
- ""Daylight"" - escapes from a watery grave...
- ""Cop Land"" - tries to escape from failure and from his past...
- ""Antz"" - tries to escape a genocidal general (but gets caught by Jennifer Lopez)
- ""D-Tox"" - tries to escape from a morbid depression and a serial killer
- ""Driven"" - tries to escape from a lot of racing cars (ultimately wins the third place...)
- ""Rambo"" (the fourth film) - escapes from Burma
- ""Bullet to the head"" - tries to escape from Khal Drogo...)))
- and finally this film...

OK, now I am done playing doctor and I can get to the review of the film itself.

There was potential in this film and there are some nice ideas and some good moments in it - in fact there is even a couple of twists which I didn't see coming. The cast is very good, as other than the actors already mentioned we have in smaller roles Sam Neill, Vincent d'Onofrio, Amy Ryan (""The Wire"") and last but not least a very, very bad and very, very bald Vinnie Jones...))) There is also a couple of good one liners - but not too many... Finally, Jim Caviezel's character is quite interesting - in fact he seems to be that guy who will one day become Mr Reese from ""Person of Interest"", it's just that he didn't meet Finch yet...)))

There is however also a lot of weak points. First let's say that most of the scenario doesn't make the SLIGHTEST sense - but I cannot really be more specific, as it would provide spoilers. The whole prison break is ultimately very disappointing as a place which seemed to be the ultimate challenge for a professional master of escape is revealed to have more holes in its security than swiss cheese... Some plot holes are so enormous that they actually made me laugh (one of them concerns security cameras...). Finally, sorry for a little SPOILER here but any prison which relies on security guards carrying firearms in areas where they can have real physical contact with inmates, well, such a place is not a high security prison - it is a MAJOR DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN!

The scenes with Stallone and Schwarzenegger are a disappointment. There was a lot of potential here for humour, tension and drama - and there is very little of any of them... The whole idea of Muslim inmates was horribly mismanaged, mostly because of enormous amount of political correctness - clearly the director didn't want them to be terrorists, so he made them into drug trafficking gangsters. But because they are Muslim, somehow they appear as honorable, heroic characters...

Let's not even talk about Sam Neill's character, a pathetic, clueless doctor who needs to check in a book what is the Hippocratic oath...)))... Poor Sam Neill, he clearly REALLY needed a paycheck...

It is a disappointing film. Rating it three stars is probably too generous - but I simply couldn't force myself to rate lower the first real Stallone-Schwarzenegger film ever... Recommended obviously for all rabid Stallone and Schwarzenegger fans (like me) - but if you are not one, well, don't expect too much...",1414540800,4,5133,4.650496141124586

The story is pretty basic.  Stallone breaks out of prisons for a living and then tells the wardens of the prison how they can improve their security so no one can get out.  But it all goes wrong when one of his business partners sells him out and keeps him in there and no one knows he is actually not a real prisoner.  So he busts out with the help of Schwarzenegger and they shoot, punch, kick and body slam everything that stands in their way until they are free and bring down the corrupt prison and it's bureaucracy.

It's entertaining in a Hollywood over the top kind of way.  It's not like it's not been done over and over before but it's worth watching if you've watched pretty much everything else.

I knew it going into the movie.

As a film, it was pretty darn good.  It was interesting in a way that would make someone want to likely watch it again.  I know I would.

Here was the pitch to studio executives: let's take every single clich from every action movie and put in it the two actors who's past movies created all thoes clichs. It will be so clichd and bad that will it will actually be good. Oh, and every character will whisper under his breath while there are explosions going on. That way we don't have to write actual dialogue.

Sigh...

I guess we are supposed suspend our disbelief to the point of never asking the obvious question of why such a prison would exist, who would finance it, and why the United States government would be in cahoots with it.

6079116,4,B00GJFX8TA,"""Escape Plan"" is an amusing, exciting modern fantasy about an escape from the most impregnable prison ever constructed, starring the two great rival all-action stars Arnold Schwartzenegger and Silvester ""Sly"" Stallone.

If you stop to think about whether any of it actually makes sense you will be in trouble, but the action and plot carries you along so convincingly that it's quite easy to suspend disbelief. Both the main stars have sometimes been accused of wooden performances, partly because both have an impassive style, but I felt that each of them showed in this film that they have become better actors over time, and both were superb in this. No film pleases everyone but I think this was one of the best performances each of the main leads has ever given, and most people who liked the films either has made before will like this.

Several of the supporting stars, particularly Sam Neill as the prison doctor, Jim Caviezel as the sinister warden, Hobbes, and Vinnie Jones as a hard man guard, also gave strong performances.

Sly Stallone plays Ray Breslin, an expert on discovering and fixing flaws in maximum security prisons. After demonstrating the weaknesses in yet another state penitentiary, he is approached by the CIA who want him to check if there are any flaws in the place they keep their most dangerous prisoners. I don't want to say too much more about the plot to avoid spoilers, but Breslin and a character called Rottmayer played by Arnold Schwartzenegger have to team up to escape from the most secure prison ever created ...

Lots of suspense, lots of plot twists some of which most viewers will seecoming a mile off and some which most people won't. Plenty of gallows humour and a few characters face moral dilemmas. Although there is a lot of action and some aspects of the plot don't make much sense, this is a more intelligent film than is common for the genre as Sly and Arnie have to use their wits as well as muscles to defeat the undefeatable barriers put in their way.

OK, obviously it's not ""Citizen Kane"" nor does it try to be, but this film is entertaining and exciting nonsense rather than just nonsense. If you like action films and generally enjoyed Arnie and Sly's previous output you will probably enjoy this.",1405036800,,2257,4.747448979591836

6079124,3,B00GJFX8TA,"There were always those action stars, who you watched countlessly during the 80's as they pumped out actioner after actioner. And you know just as much as I did, that you fantasized about the possibilities of having those two actors in the same film. But it was just a fantasy, a dream that wouldn't reach reality until more than 30 years later with the release of 'Escape Plan'. Generic title aside, the film features the epic mash up of our Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) and our Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) as two old dudes trying to escape from prison. I must say, I had a great time with this brainless popcorn film, but might as well share what I felt about the film, besides the entertainment level. My review of 'Escape Plan' below.

 'Escape Plan' follows Ray Breslin (Played by Sylvester Stallone) whose profession is literally escaping from prisons. He walks in disguised as a convict and eventually breaks out. His job is to test prisons to make sure they are escape proof. And finally he meets his match, accepting anew prison named The Tomb, Breslin walks in just as he usually would but in this case, he isn't meant to be allowed out. Aided by fellow prisoner, Emil Rottmayer (Played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), Breslin attempts to escape The Tomb.

Yes, I'll admit it's an interesting idea, but once you watch the movie, that idea unfolds rather predictably. It's just the fact that the plot doesn't have enough meat to make it tough to break through. It's basically one layered. Once you finally pick off that layer, you reach the bone, and once you reach the bone, you're basically done. The plot is, because by then you know what's going to unfold to the end. The plot isn't anything you haven't already viewed before in countless other brainless action flicks. It's too lazy, too predictable. It plays out just how you would expect, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it's far from being good. Nothing you see makes you say 'Wow, now that's something I've never seen before'.

The dialogue is somewhat lazy and very much expected in this type of film. You have three main action movie dialogue. First up are the cheesy one liners, which were ushered out of the mouths of both Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Next you have the grunts and moans, which passed out the mouths of many characters. And lastly you have the vast shouts of foul language that is the seal of action film approval. Nothing here is more than average dialogue; nothing is said that stimulates your thought train.

But I must admit we have two talented leads that ride this tale along with ease, as they are in facts veterans of the genre itself, you could even call the two, two of the founding fathers of the genre. I refuse to praise one over the other, clearly there is a more prominent one of the two throughout the film, taking the possessive lead role, but both hold their own, and in t he end tie for the lead awards. Schwarzenegger and Stallone work well together, they play off each other. Both have great chemistry with the other, and when they meet on screen for the first time, ever, the room goes silent. A small smirk appears across your face at that moment, victory, at last dreams have come true. Schwarzenegger coming off a so-so return to the genre in 'The Last Stand' redeems himself in this film, and Stallone still convinces the audience that no matter his Weighing age, he still has what it takes to lead an action film, convincingly. As for the supporting cast, 'Jim Caviezal' comes to mind. In the recent years, Caviezal has reduced his bigger budgeted film appearances in favor of more independent film work. In his return to the big-budget genre, Caviezal plays the sinister, villainous Warden of The Tomb. Every scene he was in, he stole the show. He held his own to the more experienced leads, who were much more acquainted with the genre then he was himself, and he ends up played a formidable foe to Schwarzenegger and Stallone. While I wished he had more screentime then he was given, he manages to make the most of his time, and till his end, he was the most interesting of the lot, both his performance and his character.

Speaking of characters, we don't have many unique ones in this lot. Back stories would have been taken kindly, if only there were any. Only one do we receive and that is for Stallone's character. Now, I must admit the character's back-story is heart wrenching and somewhat emotional, but not very much surprising, once you get to know him. Still never the less, he is one of the few characters that isn't just there to be there. The other interesting character is the film's own villain. He is sophisticated, clever, mean, crazy, and calm. He is everything at once; it's a lot to take in, in the few minutes he has per scene he's in. But man, do you solute him off with awe. A spotlighted character in a sea of unmentionables.

The sets were pretty marveling. The prison itself was pretty amazing, the cells, and the reckroom. The prison just was perfectly designed from head to toe. The clear glass cells were pretty well set up, and seemed to go on endlessly. They glowed in the darkened area. The different rooms came out looking like a real prison, just more high tec. It was just amazing and how precise the designers were.

What makes an action movie, an action movie is of course the action itself. And when you get to the bottom of it, there is plenty of action, more towards the climax but still there is action. And I must admit it was pretty well choreographed. In the shot that watches over the prisoners as they fight the guards toward the end really comes to mind. That action shot looked to include roughly 33 prisoners and 200 guards. And with smoke blaring, and guns firing and men hollering, you need to make sure it comes out just right. And with relief they do succeed in doing just that. You get perfectly quick and practiced punching and fighting and I just loved every moment of it.

The editing is so-so. At times it comes out roughly, which at the most part occurs during Stallone's quick plummet into a pile of water after discovering where he was. And sometimes there is a glitch during fight scenes, some shots of the cells weren't angled perfectly but overall it comes out fine.

I must spend a moment to praise the entertainment level the film had. Not during one moment did I stop, and yawn. I was wide awake and chewing down on my supply of popcorn. That's what the film is, a popcorn film. Brainless, as it was, it was still very entertaining. And to the common moviegoer that's exactly what they want. Something that distracts their minds from the stress of reality, and the film does just that. It entertains you, and leaves you happy in the end. So that only makes it hard to hate the film.

All and all, 'Escape Plan' serves you what you want, brainless entertainment, and with that sacrifices an excellent cast, with an uninspiring story and characters you'll end up forgetting in the end. C+ 2/27/14",1404691200,2,6988,4.604819277108434

Escape Plan is actually a very good film, I won't disregard Stallone's knack for knowing how to use a good formula, but this film has some twists I didn't see coming and moves are a good pace.

He is a security expert that gets himself thrown in the most notorious and unbreakable prisons and finds a way out. He is a thinker, he observes and does more than report. He exposes the weakness in the system and he gets paid very well for it. When he is approached to try his Houdini act on the worlds more impenetrable prison he takes the job knowing his friends are always there in case something goes wrong. Soon he finds his identity erased and all trails leading to him are gone. Getting out now is paramount and a matter of life and death, literally. Arnold already an inmate decides to befriend him. Together they attempt the impossible. It does get tense and there are prison fights, no surprise there, but once he figures a way out, he discovers just how hopeless the situation he is in. The last 45 minutes or so are a fight to get away and somehow get help before they discover who Arnold really is and why it is so important to keep Sly in. Things explode in the end and Arnold gets his signature big gun so all things are not lost. This is a different role for both actors and one I found I actually liked. but it could have used a few more booms just because it's Sly and Arnold.

Basically, you get two, older, muscled-up stars (Schwarzenegger and Stallone) doing what they do best: kicking a-- to overthrow the bad guys and looking like bada--es while they do it.  Also, a couple of surprises throughout, such as Sam Neil and Vinnie Jones.  While Schwarzenegger and Stallone don't ""look"" the way they did 20 years ago, I've got to say that the tenacity of these two is inspiring, and if I look as half as good when I'm their age, I'll say I'm doing alright.

6079194,3,B00GJFX8TA,"Fun movie. 3 stars because of the lousy audio. The sound engineer on this must have had their hearing aid out. Background noise far overshadows the dialog in most of the film.

6079226,2,B00GJFX8TA,"Starts out rather interesting but the plot devolves into the typical ""America is bad, the worlds worst criminals aren't so bad if you just get to know them"" kind of movie.

The movie is careful to make the ""main criminal"" (schwarznegger) a sort of Robin Hood (who would never have been subject to rendition in the first place) and the jail keepers corrupt sadistic sociopaths hell bent on lining their pockets.

Typical of today's formulaic action movies. The bad guy really has a heart and the good guy is really a bad guy in waiting.",1399248000,,535,4.621052631578947

6079229,5,B00GJFX8TA,"I love thrill movies that have challenges with unbeatable odds, and ""Escape Plan"" meets those requirements.  It's fun to see Messrs. Stallone and Schwarzenegger together, their chemistry, and as an audience, we know their history.  They play their characters so centered that they can endure any kind of confrontational torture or riot coming their way.  It's fun to see them work as a team and never giving up whenever the circumstances are grim.  Their characters have no choice but to stay completely focused, befriending enemies along the way, to get their ""escape plan"" accomplished.  I especially loved Jim Caviezel's sadistic warden.  I felt that his interpretation of his character could have easily been transported back to any of the concentration camps in the 1930's, and he would have fit right in.  This is a fun movie to watch, so get a bowl of popcorn, and just savor the ride.",1399161600,,892,4.946308724832215

6079237,5,B00GJFX8TA,"I am becoming cautious, when trying to discern, from the very brief description, the possible enjoyment that I may realize from a movie. I have opened myself to a very wide range of genres, countries in which the movie was produced ( yes, including those in the language of the country, with sub titles ), as well as actors, in a feeble intent to select a movie that can be enjoyable and has a script written by a team that has in aggregate, an IQ of at lease 80, and a school education, as a minimum, the 4th grade. With that caveat, the movie surprised me in many ways. While setting a story that has sufficient action, plausibility, and a story line that does not anticipate that the average viewer reguires an adult to help them get dressed.
It is nearly impossible to describe aspects of the story that will not leak some of the twists and turns. I am also pleased when an actor who has been type cast, once too often, can surprise the viewers with enough of a change to keep the interest flowing. It is certainly not a standard action/shoot them up story, but a mix of suspense with sufficient action to keep most viewers interested.",1398902400,,1139,4.428571428571429

6079244,5,B00GJFX8TA,Man I tell you this movie is good. My favorite part about about this movie was Arnold being a mean bad man in the prison and kicking butt. Sylvester  Looked better then he did in Expendable's. I would say this movie would be the redeeming step from Expendable's wich wasn't a bad movie just not a great one. So enjoye and see I told you so. :),1398729600,,343,4.119402985074627

Stallone is then 'kidnapped' and taken to this new, supposedly totally secure, no way anyone could ever break out, prison. There he meets up with Schwarzenegger and the story takes off.

6079278,3,B00GJFX8TA,"If you keep your expectations low you might enjoy wsting some time with this movie.

The part that really sucked in this movie (not the only one) is when they decided to ""break"" Stallones ""will"" or whatever. It was the same, lame ""evil warden versus the special convict"" clich&eacute;'. It included some old Rocky themes when they say they will ""break"" him. Break him from what is not clear other than he was pals with Swartz.

If you have seen every other movie you felt like watching and just want to kill some time this is a very crappy movie that may fit the bill. Has a lot of stars but other than that the plot, writing, and same-ole lines are a joke at best. Oh, you do get to see Swartz hold a big machinegun again (yawn).",1397952000,,730,4.282608695652174
6079279,3,B00GJFX8TA,"I would say that Stallone and Schwarzenneggar did better playing together in Expendables 2 than this film. First of all the story was hard to follow as far as getting down to the core of understanding how they would break out. It bounced around alot in various scenes not having a steady plot to follow. I think Stallone might have been better off playing the role solo and actually showing the ways he can break out in step by step order. Details please. Ex: Eastwoods old flick Escape from Alcatraz. That was good. It showed workable and believable ideas to actually break out. So that being said, I recommend this as a cheap rental. Don't buy. Arnold was great in his own movie ""The Last Stand"" but not in this one.",1397865600,2,718,4.488549618320611

6079288,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Ray Breslin (Stallone) is an expert at escaping from prison. He accepts a job at a high tech prison which is off the grid, i.e. doesn't officially exist. However, Ray is double crossed and is now in a situation where he must escape to survive. The film includes fellow inmate Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vinnie Jones as a sadistic guard. This is not a simple grunt escape film, but develops levels of complexity with twists.

The film is an action drama with some thrills. By modern action standards it moves slow so it can develop the story. There is a rivalry banter mixed into the dialog between Arnold and Stallone for those who pay attention.

Worth a view for old Arnie and Sly fans. Don't pay too much. Should be a bargain film soon after it goes to DVD.

He's abducted and placed...somewhere...and must find his way out though someone wants him there permanently. That's the plot and the way it's handled leaves little room for the cliches and expected plot turns one usually finds in these type films.  There are a few, of course, you can't escape some.  It's a good cast, with Schwartzenegger as another prisoner with ties to someone those on the outside want very badly. Jim Cavaziel, is as soft-spoken as ever but more cold-blooded as the warden, a character which might actually be the ultimate extenuation of the one he plays on ""Person of Interest"".  There are some violent scene with no holds barred and plenty of climbing through tunnels and hair's-breadth escapes from discovery before all is said and done. It's an entertaining movie and there's plenty of action but it appears more of a cautious, thought-out kind this time around (though there are a couple of great explosions so we won't be disappointed).

6079302,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape Plan was better than I thought it would be, and while the final prison seems far fetched, I learned years ago that no movie is ever made just for you and I to be entertained. Even if the person who wrote the movie has never been to prison, or escape from anything, the truth is always stranger than fiction and the source material for this came from someone's personal experience. Not necessarily breaking out of prison, but Shawshank 2013 was going to come out eventually. Sylvester Stallone, when I see him now versus when he played Rocky, I guess that at some point actors will consider getting some work on their face or the body, and while he gives a good performance, the emotions of a scene seems to Escape him for whatever was Plan-ned. Unless it's a fight scene where his lips have to skew at an angle to show that energy from his punch, Stallone will never again cry like Rocky did when his trainer died or give another gut-wrenching yell, ""Adrienne!"" Arnold, on the other hand, left from being a governor to getting back into the spotlight to make up that revenue he missed out on that being a governor could not match. He seems to accept aging, recognizing Predator would not see him as a threat anymore. The pressure must be intense when an actor wants a roll but a few years have come and gone and the next he or she is being touted as the next great actor to come along in a generation. So what are your options: go under the knife in an feeble attempt to shed a few years, only to look like an age that no one can tell? Or, become a people greeter at Wallie World, and you know to get full time hours is rare with that monopoly? Ah, I digress, Escape Plan was good enough that I purchased it without any regret, good enough that my wife and I have watched it again. If this was the 80s, when they were at the peak of their popularity, matching these two on the same screen would have been the equivalent to The Avengers, or any other billion dollar generating money maker, for sure.

How could a small packet of surgical or first-aid instruments be altered into a sextant for one of the escapees?

6079336,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape or Escape Plan(released Oct/13)stars,among others,Sylvester Stallone as Ray Breslin,Arnold Schwarzenegger as Emil Rottmayer,Jim Caviezel as Willard Hobbes and Sam Neil as the doctor. Ever since Mr Stallone's tragic loss of his son he has thrown himself into his work with a vengeance,and so far he created some wonderful cinema. His latest entry is this film in which his main co star is Arnold. Now before I hear the guffaws and giggles on how old these two screen vets are,I ask you to watch this film. Stallone is in great shape and Arnie is slowly getting back to his old self. Both come across as vibrant, kick butt actors and this work is as good as anything both have done recently or in the past.
The story finds Sly as a gun for hire. In this instance he is a man sent into maximum security prisons to test the prisons security and if possible,escape. He is paid very handsomely for his work. As the film begins we are witness to his prowess in escaping. After that job he is given a new assignment by a lady from the CIA.They have a secret off the grid prison they want him to try and escape from. The payment is double what he has received before. His boss OKs the plan,as does Sly.
Sly dutifully waits at the rendezvous point and is taken aboard a van. However they guards inside remove Sly's tracking device,so  his compatriots back at his office cannot track him. He comes to in a plexiglass cubicle surrounded by several like cubicles. It is a humongous facility the likes of which he has never encountered before. He will have to use every thing he has ever learned and then some to extricate himself from this situation.
He soon becomes friends with Arnie. Arnie is a high profile inmate whose boss,a Victor Manheim,is someone the prison warden(Caviezel)wants to know more about. It seems there are people willing to pay big bucks for that information. Sly has given the warden his secret code for release but the warden has refused to acknowledge it. So Sly and Arnie create a diversion and end up,purposely,in solitary. Sly uses a metal piece from the floor Arnie grabbed while being interrogated in the warden's office earlier. Sly manages to pop floor rivets and escape the room. Down he goes and then up. He ends up outside but it is not where he expected to be. He is on a  huge ship in the ocean,location unknown. Sly returns to the room.
Sly informs Arnie of their situation and they enlist the help of a Muslim inmate,Javed. The ruse Javed will perform is to get the warden,in exchange for information on the inmate's doings,to allow him to do his prayers in the open air,or close to it. The ruse works and he is able to get put into a cargo hold with a view of the sky. Little does anyone know he carries a home made sextant which will tell them roughly where the ship is. Back down in the common area Sly retrieves the sextant and learns they're along latitude 30 degrees. He guesstimates it is somewhere off the Moroccan coast.
Back at Sly's office two of his compatriots have been working feverishly trying to discover Sly's whereabouts. The only thing they have found is he is in a prison called the ""Tomb"",but do not know its location. They also find out that a $2 million cheque has been frozen. They go to the boss but he tells them not to worry,it's ""the government"".
At the prison Sly is now feeding the warden false info about the mysterious Manheim. The day he finally gives the warden a ""location"" where Manheim can be found is the day Sly,Arnie and Javed decide to break out once and for all. They start a huge fight. Arnie has made contact with ""people"" outside who will be able to help them off the ship once they're out. At first all goes fairly well until they reach the hatch Sly originally climbed outside of. The warden has gotten wind of the break out attempt and has locked down all hatches. Back down they go and they get into a firefight. Jared is ultimately killed while Sly disables the power long enough for Arnie to escape.
Arnie's ""people"" arrive in a helicopter and he keeps the armed guards at bay,waiting for Sly. But Sly has been unable to escape the normal way and has locked himself in a tank of water. Knowing the rebooted system will fill the tank back up and flush it,he waits and is sent out beneath the ship. He comes up just as Arnie in the chopper has left the ship. They spot him and lower a ladder to pick him up. The warden has spotted them and is taking pot shots their way. Sly sets some flammable containers ablaze which also takes care of the warden.
On shore Arnie and Sly are greeted by Arnie's rescue party. It turns out to be the CIA agent who came to Sly's office in the first place! She also happens to be Arnie's daughter,and Arnie is the mysterious Manheim! She also reveals that Sly's boss did a runaround on both him and her and in order to keep the $5 million for himself,had Sly sent away""permanently"".
Sly gets back home and his partners have been informed of their bosses double dealings. The film ends with the boss,his SUV with him in it,locked in a cargo container on a freighter bound for......?
The film is tension filled throughout as the camera gets in really close  with a you-are-there feel to it. The socko ending really catches one off guard. As Sly says when he learns that Arnie is Manheim,""Gee,I didn't see that one coming"".Neither did we. Both Arnie and Sly work well together,playing off one another. Faran Tahir as Javid also manages to do a very credible job and holds his own with the two main stars. Caviezel is one twisted son of a gun of a warden. The S/FX are good as is the action,which ebbs and flows at just the right moments.
Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:77:1. Extras include commentary and a featurette.
All in all chalk this up as another winner for Mr. Stallone. He is on a definite roll of late and we can only wish for better things to come. Arnie is certainly""baaack"" as he and Sly play well off of each other. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1396569600,,5984,4.46800731261426

It was a poor choice on my part.",1396569600,5,337,4.21875

6079340,5,B00GJFX8TA,I liked it a lot. Nice to these old school action heroes working together. Sly and Arnold are the best!,1396483200,,103,4.2
6079341,3,B00GJFX8TA,"While not every element of this high-tech prison movie clicks, Stallone and Schwarzenegger make for a good cinematic team and save the movie from falling into treacherous b-movie territory. The story is pretty simple: Stallone plays a guy who breaks out of prison for a living to test their security. However, on his latest job, he's set up and left to rot. He ends up joining forces with Schwarzenegger, and the two of them attempt to break out. These stars are the primary reason to see this film because most of the supporting cast just isn't given too much to do, nor are a lot of the bit parts particularly well acted or have compelling characters. Stallone and Schwarzenegger's characters aren't terribly well written either, but just enough detail is given and both of them bring some charisma to their roles. The also play off of one another quite well. The surprise gift in the cast, however, is Jim Caviezel as a sadistic warden. He plays his part with a certain calm and poise, which could be unsettling at times considering some of the violence he perpetrates on the inmates under his charge. In fact, a lot of the violence wasn't particularly fun to watch (not that violence should necessarily be fun to watch, though). Some of the negatives I can point out are a rather weak script that has a lot of implausibilities and narrative contrivances. There were a few twists, but nothing that a discerning moviegoer couldn't tell ahead of time. Out of the cast, Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson stood out as probably the worst of them all. He can't act, and I don't know why he keeps getting roles, especially here as a tech wizard. There was also some bad CGI explosions which looked out of place. Overall, this is an ok piece of ""escape""-ist entertainment (see what I did there?). Turn your brain off and you should have a good time.",1396483200,,1835,4.649230769230769

The idea behind the film was good, however it sort of got lost along the way with a lot of unnecessary plot twists.  Arnold and Sylvester are getting a little better at acting, but are still difficult to understand at times. Good speaking voices they have not. As a prison breakout movie it strains credibility. The question came to mind. If a prison warden knows ahead of time that you will try and break out of a highly secure prison, would you not be able to stop it before it occurred, especially when it was obvious that everything you were doing indicated an imminent escape?  Each time I watch a film today I get the feeling I  could have done a much better job of writing and directing.",1396310400,,858,4.283950617283951

6079355,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Disclaimer - I love dumb action movies. I do not care if the plot makes no sense. I do not care if the acting is phoned in. I do not care about suspension of disbelief. I do not care about plot holes bigger than the Sahara  desert. I enjoy the fast pace, excitement and thrills. So, for me, this movie delivered. And since it is at the core a prison break movie, it has more suspense than just shoot em up action. I like Stallone, I like Schwartzeneger and the movie hops along at a very brisk pace. The opening scene is really cool because you don't really know what Stallone is up to until afterwards. One thing - the real (i.e. top) bad guy is very predictable and no surprise. But this is a big, dumb action movie - so who cares.

6079364,4,B00GJFX8TA,"The Escape Plan was a good, solid action movie, where both Schwarzenegger and Stallone deliver.  The storyline is pretty believable, the setting is great, and the plot twist (no spoilers) really makes for some great in-film elements to test the protagonists' mettle.  The weakest link here, however, is about the warden.  Jim Caviezel as the warden is weak.  He is very two-dimensional (maybe even one-dimensional), shows little real emotion, and progresses through the movie like he is on Xanax.  Even when he is about to meet his demise (again, no spoilers), he reacts in a way that makes his death completely unbelievable, as if he knows he is going to re-spawn fifty meters to the south like in Call of Duty.  Aside from his garbage performance, the movie is rather enjoyable and is a great film to enjoy on a Saturday night.

6079395,2,B00GJFX8TA,"When I first heard about this film when it was originally titled ""The Tomb"", i couldn't wait to see it! A Sly and Arnie team-up action thriller, this is the movie we had been waiting years to see! Despite not being hits at the box office, I really enjoyed The Last Stand and Bullet to the Head so I was very excited to see Escape Plan and hoped it would be up there with the other previously released films.

While the film had a good start and some decent moments, it ended up being one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me. First off, the film despite starring two of the biggest action stars of all time, feels much more like a generic prison escape thriller than an action movie. It does have action here and there, but not nearly as much as you'd expect. And without enough action, there just isn't enough there to keep the film entertaining for it's nearly 2 hour runtime. While Arnold who looked like he was having a blast was very fun to watch, Stallone looked tired and seemed like he really didn't want to be there and just showed up for a paycheck. I love Stallone, but he really did take some of the much needed energy out of a film that was in need of it. The story was interesting for the first half of the film, but I felt like it really dragged around the halfway point and really wanted it to wrap things up. The action that is in the film is actually very good and the climax which goes on for a good 20 minutes is awesome!

It did have it's moments, but being a huge fan of the two actors, I couldn't help but feel extremely letdown. It just felt dull and rather generic for what it could've been. Worth renting, but it's just disappointing knowing how great this could've been. I'd recommend The Last Stand, Bullet to the Head, or Homefront if you are looking for 80's-esque action films.",1395446400,3,1821,4.290697674418604
6079396,4,B00GJFX8TA,"My family and I were looking to find a movie on Friday night and when we had exhausted the list of new releases that appealed to us, we started thinking, hey we like Arnold Schwarzanaegger, have we seen all of Arnie's movies? We came across Escape Plan and then saw it also contained Sylvester Stallone. Once we began watching it and seeing Sly in prison we at first were a bit upset, thinking hmm he's not a hero? We were far surprised within the first 30 minutes learning that there was more to his character and that although in a prison, he was not a prisoner. This continued on and we saw him meet with Arnie. It was great. Seeing the two of them fight, epic. Seeing Arnie act like Rambo, Seeing Sly play the brainiac, to me this was great.

Even the acting of Arnold and Sly was pretty decent. Caviezel was pretty perfect as the nemesis. He was actually kind of scary....not overt, but in a subtle, ammoral, menacing sort of way....the kind of dude you never see coming until he's already there. Anyway, the movie has it's fair share of action, and the obligatory parts wrote in for both Sly and Arnold, made hilarious, since when it gets to those scenes, they smile a little first, letting you know that they know it's ridiculous, but also sort of their trademark moment, lol.

6079404,2,B00GJFX8TA,"The Expendables is a very fun product, and so are the movies that these two have made on their own (Last Stand, Bullet to the Head), but Escape Plan is just too boring because it puts Stallone and Schwarzenegger into ""acting"", maintaining dialogues where they have to pretend  to be smart.

These should know when to stop, or at least make best selections when accepting roles.",1395360000,,377,4.696969696969697

6079407,2,B00GJFX8TA,"Like many, it's a surprise to see Stallone and Schwarzenegger finally in a movie together (with the exception of The Expendeables, but that was a cameo by Arnie in those). Had these two teamed up back in the 80's or early 90's, it would have probably broken box office records no matter what they where in. Now it just seems like what was a pipe dream years ago is finally a reality, but a few years too late for it ride on the fact these two are in it alone and make it epic.

Stallone plays a character whose job is to escape from prisons to determine if they are escape proof or not? That is until he finds himself hired to attempt to escape from a secret prison that is off the radar. Only Stallone finds out where he is sent is designed and run by someone who has studied how he broke out of a bunch of prisons, and has also been paid to keep Stallone from ever escaping.

Pretty thin sounding plot, and you can guess the end already. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a prison inmate who takes a liking to Stallone right off the bat. The chemistry between Stallone playing the typical loner character with no emotions but to escape and Arnold trying to act like your average everyday Joe that has always come off laughable just don't mesh well together in this film.

Stallone pretty much must have agreed to do the film is Arnie was his side-kick and not the other way around, as Stallone pretty much tries to take control of the movie while Arnie feels like he is phoning it in.

Escape plan, where are they, and how will they get out? A predictable ending and not so much action as you would expect these two to deliver. Overall, if one or the other stars of this film where not in it, it would be an easily forgettable flick, had neither of them done it, it would be an episode you would expect to see on ""Prison Break""... not to mention this movie has the worst use of Sam Neil I have ever seen in a movie. An almost completely pointless role.

Overall: After viewing it and getting over the fact it's Rambo and The Terminator together... you can see why it was not released in theatres. Don't get fooled by a lot of reviews who where just happy to see these two Hollywood action stars together at last. Names alone don't make a movie great.

Movie Review: ??? Spoilers??? No, sorry no spoilers. It was a fun movie with Stallone and Arnold, albeit the need to suspend my disbelief was strong. There's no way they should have not known to some degree what type of prison they were in! And the creative ways to compromise institutional security were entertaining.

It's worth the watch!",1395100800,,577,4.818181818181818

6079430,4,B00GJFX8TA,"I may be somewhat partial, but I'm a fan of most of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, Stallone somewhat. Even though they are older now, the movie was very good. Great plot, better than some of their earlier movies when they were much younger. One of the things that make a movie good for me, is does the story line make sense, is the action scenes realistic, do the people playing the parts fit . (too old , too young, too cocky, not believable) I think this fit my criteria, and I would recommend this to all Stallone & Schwarzenegger fans. Oh and one more thing not a lot of F words, movies really don't need all that to be good.",1395014400,2,628,4.285714285714286

I thought some of the escape scenes and techniques were pretty entertaining.  The two lead female roles were well done - showing women in intelligent strong characters instead of the usual eye candy.",1395014400,,430,5.3088235294117645

Now they look as befuddled, wrinkled and lacking in muscle tone as your 70 year old grandpa. Almost expected the bad guys to apologize before punching at them.  And speaking of bad guys, they're endless ... at least 5 ""ex-Blackwater"" guards for every prisoner in this private maximum security prison on a floating oil tanker.",1394928000,,441,5.027397260273973

6079441,2,B00GJFX8TA,"Intriguing premise. Film gets off to a fast paced and interesting start, then collapses into an chaotic shoot em up, mess of an ending. There are Logical plot holes, and multiple loose ends not tied up. Stallone and Schwarzenager are starting to look a little old for an action movie. Not credible for the actions scenes anymore, which in and of themselves are always a little goofy looking anyway. ( Amazing how the villains can never hit the target even with multiple attackers spraying multiple rounds of automatic weapons fire at two old guys with handguns.)
Ok for a 3- 4 dollar rental on a long flight viewed on your iPad ( The setting in which I viewed this movie) Otherwise find something better to do.",1394928000,,710,4.642857142857143

6079443,4,B00GJFX8TA,"To begin with, when I first noticed that the movie was on DVD and starring Sly Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, it peaked my interest to the extent that I purchased the DVD and hoped for the bet.  I was not disappointed.  I am impressed that the two actors have continued to produce movies that entertain.  I was not looking for a movie with a message or another depressing story of a dysfunctional family even though there have been some released with excellent acting.  Escape Plan has an interesting story, good pace and enough action that melded well with the story.  You have to admit that both actors have been around for some time and they continue to entertain.  I recommend this DVD.",1394928000,,695,4.655737704918033

6079449,5,B00GJFX8TA,"I bought this because I am a huge fan of Jim Caviezel.  And was hoping to see him in a couple of scenes.  Much to my surprise and delight he is the third and most important lead in this movie.  He does bad so good, and frankly out acted both Arnie and Sly.  Not to mention that he is 20 years younger and much better looking.  So if you are fans of those two aging action stars, they do a so so job, but Caviezel is the true star of this movie.  I don't think Sly and Arnie will make the mistake of casting a younger better actor again.",1394841600,,536,3.871559633027523

So while there are moments of intensity, after all, this is a prison movie(!), it wasn't all that bad. Great Cast!! Lots of fun, and actually had some feel good moments (for a prison movie!). I think Stallone and Schwarzenegger are improving with age. I think this is one of their better ones.",1394841600,,431,4.4

I like both actors and have seen all their action movies.  But this was just painful with the expectation it was going to be really good.  I found the acting almost like the actors were filmed by themselves, at different times and never got the vibe they really never 'played' off one another.

I would give it 3 stars but I feel, some PR team is pumping this rating up, so I'll go the other direction.  If this had a 3 or 2 rating, I would have went it with lower expectations and would have been so disappointed.

On my meter, perhaps wait until it's a free download then enjoy... or set your sights low.",1394755200,,760,4.171232876712328

Disappointment is the reason i waited so long to see Escape and boy am I kicking myself over that decision because not only is Escape Plan a great throwback of prison movies it's a great movie in its own right!
Sylvester Stallone portrays a escape artists who makers a living escaping out of prisons to find flaws to help keep prisoner from getting out. One he's offer a gig to break out of the next big fortified clink only to discovered he's been set up! The only way for Stallone to break out is with the help of another prisoner, a favor man played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
The film is well written, well paced, good tension, superb acting that reminded me these two can act when given the right movie as well as a Fantastic villain From the warden played by Jim Caviezel.

6079500,2,B00GJFX8TA,"Although the tagline pretty much covers it, I'll elaborate.

I've seen a hundred movies like this one, and they all are pretty much the same; they're lame, formulaic, and are thinly held together by implausible plots and unrealistic characters.  What makes this even worse is watching two former mega stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger trying to reenact their glory days roles.  They fail miserably.  It was just too difficult to take either one of them very seriously as action heroes when both are pushing 70 years old.  (And when one really takes a moment to analyze their acting, especially Arnold's, neither of them are that good, and are the only ones to whom most of us would give this great a margin of forgiveness for such lackluster performances.)

But, if you like tired, formulaic, overdone, mindless and predictable action movies, then by all means, part with your money and rent it.  Just don't buy it.",1394323200,,920,4.896774193548387
6079501,5,B00GJFX8TA,"As they say in the film features, the studios have been trying to get Sly and Arnold together for a film and this one is a blast. From the start to the finish this film moves like the thundering roller coaster, and delivers with both barrels. Even the much demeaned Curtis Jackson in my opinion delivers on the level of the prime players. Whilst Sly's character ""Ray Breslin"" is a security analyst, we are continually left guessing as to who is who for the rest of the film. This delivers two characters that one producer has hinted may be used again in a follow-up film or films. It is very clear that everyone doing the film enjoyed themselves, so it will be just a matter of whether the financial returns can be justified for anyone backing the films. But, as far as this film goes, it's fun it's enjoyable and as one person put it, it's a thinking man's action film, and I agree with that.
  The extras on the Blu-ray are superb. The audio commentary with the director and cowriter is very insightful and very enjoyable. The feature about the making of the film called EXECUTING THE PLAN runs in at approximately 20 to 22 minutes and is a lot of fun. The feature called CLASH OF THE TITANS is partially a mini bio of sly and Arnold as well as their role in ESCAPE PLAN, and runs approximately 13 to 15 minutes. The documentary THE REAL LIFE TOMB is partially a history of prisons as well as ""corrections"" in the US; whilst they clearly want you to believe that the maximum security prisons as well as the federal super Max is un-breachable, they do qualify their statements with almost escape proof, and pay close attention to the comments made by Bruce Schneier, since he is a well-respected security analyst who knows his material, and to top it all off he is not the only one who raises a few doubts about the total security of these high and super Max security prisons. They better up their game, since whilst they sneer at ESCAPE PLAN being pure Hollywood, their own prisons are not 100% escape proof. If you want to believe that you are safe from the super criminals, do not watch this documentary called THE REAL-LIFE TOMB.
  The deleted scenes are a disappointment: key scenes are deleted, one was in my opinion essential. One deleted scene showed Arnold acting skill in droves. An expository edit at the end of the film is a big loss.",1394323200,2,2347,4.489461358313817

6079547,3,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape Plan proves that Arnold and Stallone still have some life left in them in terms of their careers as action stars.  The film has an interesting enough premise, great casting, and some decent action.  So it pretty much has nearly everything you would want from an action popcorn film like this.  However, there are some missteps the film makes, but it does not outright ruin the film.  This film definitely will not win any awards, but that is not the aim for a film like this.  Escape Plans primary goal is to entertain and, in my opinion, it succeeded.

The story is fairly simple, but that is not always a bad thing.  Many times with action films when they try to make the plot overly complicated it can make what could have been a good action film into a boring and lackluster one.  The film stars a man named Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) who is a famous escape artist.  He is known for breaking out of high security prisons that are deemed in-escapable.  However, he is framed and put into a prison that he indirectly helped to design.  To escape he has to team up with a small group of inmates, mainly a man named Emil (Arnold Schwarzenegger).

The acting is fine for what it is.  You do not go to movie like this for Oscar-worthy performances.  Stallone does alright, although whenever he tries to sound like he is super intelligent and explain complex science it comes off a little funny.  I buy Stallone as a scientist as much as I bought Arnold as a scientist in the movie Junior.  The movie even acknowledges it, but it is still silly.  However, I have to admit, this is probably one of Arnolds better performances in a long time.  Yes, he does spam the one-liners a lot, but he also tries other forms of acting besides being the badass (which he is in the film).  There are many points were Arnolds character is put in many terrible positions and shows much vulnerability and emotion.  This is the first time in a while where Arnold is put in such a vulnerable position.  It is not going to win any awards, but I thought it was pretty good for Arnold.  Sam Neil also appears in a small role, which I like.  I am glad that the man is still getting some, though I wish I could have seen more of him.

The film has some good production value.  You can tell that the film has a budget and the money is on the screen.  I do not know how the 3D was because I only saw it in 2D.  The film also has some pretty decent action, though most of it comes at the end.  There is some action in the beginning and middle but it is few and far between.  It is mostly Arnold and Stallone plotting their escape.  This film does not have wall-to-wall action, which some people might be disappointed about.

There are some issues with the film as I mentioned earlier.  Firstly, the villains are not that strong.  The main villain of the film, Hobbes, is horrible.  He is played by Jim Caviezel or as I like to call non-Matthew Fox (Jack Shepard from Lost).  It seemed like he was trying to channel Bob Gunton from Shawshank Redemption, and it does not work at all.  Caviezel either overacts his lines or underacts them.  Secondly, there is a twist by the end of the film that you see coming a mile away.  Even the film acknowledged that it was a pretty obvious twist.

Overall, Escape plan was an entertaining escape/action film, as well as a good time at the movies.  It was nice to see Arnold and Stallone working together in a film outside of the Expendables.  The film does have good production value and some decent action at the end.  If you are a fan of Arnold, Stallone, or both then check this out.",1393718400,,3602,4.3629518072289155

6079550,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape plan is a movie about a security expert (Stallone) finds himself set up and incarcerated in the world's most secret and secure prison, he has to use his skills to escape with help from another prisoner on the inside (Schwarzenegger).

I will say that this movie surprised me as most of the recent Stallone outings were decidedly 80's in its feel but this one is a bit different and in a good way (although there are a couple lines I suspected were put in as a tribute to those 80's action movies that they did, ""Boom"" during one of the climatic scenes for example"".  Great action, a great story with an ending worthy of the movie and the story that is laid out.  Stallone and Arnold both do a great job in their roles playing less action heroes that their typical roles and really doing a good job as their respective characters.  Even the supporting cast play their roles very well and the villians very believable.

This movie keeps you entertained all the way through with a strong plot and great action.  A worthwhile watch.",1393718400,,1035,4.537634408602151

In an interview with Sly, he says that it's very hard to find scripts that offer something totally original, and he says that he found such originality in the script for this movie.  I totally agree.  For what it is, it rises above the usual fare.  It had the usual repartee between Sly & Arnie, interesting twists and an engaging plot. More thinking, and less blowing things up makes for a good movie in my opinion.",1393459200,,620,4.660550458715596

6079577,4,B00GJFX8TA,"If you're a fan of both actors but cringed at some of the risks both have taken over the years, you'll want to see this. I thought the airport shootout in Expendables 2 was a bit of a dog. That scene just had too much friendly fire going on without any civilians getting hit and all the while Arnold is casually making quips. Anyway, escaping from prison will never be as easy as the movies make it out to be but Sly and Arnold have good chemistry on camera. I look at it as Led Zeppelin touring in support of a new album. Both men lean on what they do best but there are no cheesy homages to the past. No groaner one-liners that are an affectionate look back on previous characters. Arnold's response to the first punch from Sly is the only thing that made me think of Rocky punching the hanging meat in the 70s. A reference that might be coincidental, or too good to pass on. Stallone gives another good interview in an extra segment in which he calls it a thinking mans prison break. And no ""I'll be back"" This one is fresh.",1393372800,,1027,4.218274111675127

6079579,4,B00GJFX8TA,"There was a time when just the mention of the names Stallone and Schwarzenegger guaranteed mega-box office receipts. To hear one of them had a movie coming out in theaters was to insure long lines at the box-office. But as they've grown older and as the audience going to the theater has aged as well, it's not quite the same. There is still that small amount of buzz behind their names but not like the glory days. The new movie ESCAPE PLAN taps into those movies they once made. Watching it is like going back to the late 70s/early 80s. In truth they've aged well and remain at the top of their game.

Stallone plays Ray Breslin, a security expert who knows how to find the loopholes in any given situation. Currently he's part owner and the main man in a company that sends him into any prison unbeknownst to the warden and guards so that he can find the leaks in their system and escape. There has yet to be a prison he hasn't walked out of. The movie opens with him in prison and finding a way out, demonstrating his abilities.

Once his skills have been established we find Ray back in his office when a CIA agent shows offering top dollar for him to escape from a super secret prison that has just been built to house the worst of the worst. With only 24 hours to prepare, something he doesn't do, Ray's partner Lester (Vincent D'Onofrio) urges him to take the job and the $5 million paycheck. Against his better judgment he takes the job. The next day he finds himself in New Orleans, kidnapped and the tracker chip inserted into his arm removed. Something is amiss.

Ray wakes to find himself in a prison unlike any other. Rather than concrete cells each cell is made of extreme plexi-glass and surrounding a core stairwell. This is a prison unlike any he's ever experienced with guards rotating at odd hours and no way out that he can see. But when he gives the pass code that is supposed to insure his release, he is ignored. It seems that a double cross was done somewhere along the line and Ray is now an actual prisoner in an escape proof prison.

Discovering the day to day routine at the hands of head guard Drake (Vinnie Jones) who seems to enjoy inflicting pain and the warden of the prison Hobbs (Jim Caviezel), Ray sets about learning who is who in the prisoner hierarchy. He soon makes friends with Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) but doesn't reveal who he is. After finding himself on the Hobbes short list, he agrees to a deal: help Hobbes find out the location of Rottmayer's partner on the outside and he'll be set free.

But Ray doesn't like being placed not only in a physical cell but a mental one as well. It may seem that he's helping the Hobbes get the information that he wants but in truth he continues doing what he does best, finding an escape from an inescapable prison. He pulls Rottmayer into his plan and the viewer is now caught up in a mix of possible crosses and double crosses as the action unfolds and the escape draws near. Will they get out or is this the one place that offers no hope of escape?

Stallone does a wonderful job in this movie. This is classic Stallone where he displays an intelligence in his character that lies beneath that tough exterior. We know that if there is a way out, he will find it. Schwarzenegger also brings back the old Arnie we know and love, the tough as nails fighter and loyal friend who will eventually come up with some catch phrase that will be his signature for this movie. These are the actors we loved back in the 80s doing what they do best, making unbelievable characters believable or at least making us like them so much we don't notice how unbelievable they are.

The movie is just a fun roller coaster ride of action combined with brains to make the whole outlandish concept seem real. We thrill to the ride as we plunge over hills and down valleys never knowing what's around the next bend. Through it all we have a great time and enjoy the ride not caring about the construction or safety of it all, just enjoying ourselves. That's what the old Sly and Arnold movies offered so long ago, just a good time watching the movie. It's nice to see that the two of them can still pull it off.",1393372800,,4175,4.400259067357513

6079598,4,B00GJFX8TA,"This movie was unexpectedly compelling and entertaining. When Stallone first enters his glass cage and looks around, you know he knows ... he's screwed. You're hooked, because you want to see how he escapes. And when it's revealed where the prison is ... he's even more screwed.

But his character has smarts enough to figure out where they are, and that was an interesting exposition, too.

You'll see, though, that the prison made the error of letting the inmates mingle ... something that doesn't make sense even today, allowing crime and rape to occur (perhaps intentionally?). And that's a fatal mistake.

So Stallone and Arnie do a good enough job of taking us through the challenge of breaking out of this maximum security prison, run by (of course) an evil corporation. It's smart enough to make us look past whatever flaws you'll see and enjoy the ride.",1393286400,,862,4.850340136054422

The movie is what'd you expect from Sly and Arnold, especially at their age. Producers didn't spend big money on the special effects and once in a while you notice. Although the concept of the Stallone character is interesting, the direction is average and the script is transparent.

6079615,3,B00GJFX8TA,"Good movie and entertaining. But sometimes Hollywood stretches things a little too far. How insurmountable can the odds be before it's not good story telling anymore, but big fish stories that make your eyes roll. Also, I was shocked at how old Stallone is looking these days; the director should have never allowed those close-ups. However, the ending was something of a surprise. All-in-all, at some point these aging action hero guys need to call it a day and find something else to do other than conquer the unconquerable. It's one thing for a young body to take a beating and keep on ticking. But come on! There isn't a geriatric male alive that can get worked over with a night stick, cattle prod, etc. again and again and keep rising to the occasion. Ditto for Arnold. He's looking pretty dated too, although not to the extent of Stallone. Don't get me wrong. I'm a fan of both these guys.

However, the middle (meat) of this sandwich was a creative thought provoking presentation of antagonists who come together to figure out an escape in an environment and ways not seen in film before. That part was well acted with not the overboard stereotyped (well they did toss in a couple of scenes to satisfy a few viewers) role playing by Stallone & Schwarzenegger that they've recently portrayed in other films.

I suppose that also goes for Arnold but at least he looked good.

The story was very narrow and the characters were not too deep so they did not help make it at all believable and the production was mediocre at its best and down right silly near the end (the escape from the ""facility""). Way too many gimmicks that did not bring any tension to the story and were laughable at best.

6079642,5,B00GJFX8TA,"For the last few years, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold ""The Governator"" have been starring in several movies, even with each other.  (i.e. ""The Expendables"")  So here is another action-packed movie where the both of them once again put their efforts to use.

The scene starts off with Stallone sitting in a prison.  He makes it his job to use whatever resources necessary to break out -- and he succeeds!  After the guards are diverted to put out a car bomb fire, Stallone makes his escape and gets driven off to a nearby establishment.  However, the police soon find him and arrest him again!  But the show is over when Stallone's boss, Lester Clark, explains to the authorities that he's just an undercover agent testing out the prisons' security system -- which, of course, systematically failed to keep Stallone inside.

So Stallone is now sent out to another institution -- but this time, he gets drugged and un-tagged before he arrives at his destination ""The Tomb.""  He will encounter the Warden -- a.k.a. Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel).  And he is sure one mean Warden too!!  Along the way, Stallone will meet his inmate counterpart, Arnold.  The two of them eventually team up to find a way out of this horrible prison!  Halfway along the movie, it will be revealed that one of the ""good guys"" in the film doesn't turn out to be so good after all.  In fact, he's the inside person who set Stallone up all along!

But before that person is revealed, Stallone finds out just where he and the other prisoners are -- a thousand foot long ship that's leading towards Morocco, Africa!  So it's his job -- and Arnold's -- to distract the Warden and his faceless goons while they try to break out!  They also employ the prison doctor's help to summon a rescue helicopter.  While a bunch of chaos ensures, both comrades will eventually make it onto the deck of the ship and fly away.  As for what happens to the Warden -- well, you'll just have to tune in to the end of the movie and watch for yourselves!  :)

One really cool scene happens before the very end -- the ""inside job"" person who set up Stallone will get his very own comeuppance.  And trust me people, he'll deserve it too!  It's not much worse than being buried alive, but it's still a fate worse than death itself HA HA!  I'm very proud of both Stallone and Arnold for not just showing off their muscles, but proving to the worldwide audience that -- even in their 60's -- they aren't going anywhere just yet!!",1392940800,,2471,4.538461538461538

(That might have made this movie far more interesting.) The plot is predictable except for one twist at the end that I only missed because I was on Facebook, and the action isn't really gripping enough to hold your attention for the full run time, but they try. Ultimately, this movie is a testament to the saying ""With age comes wisdom,"" as the two Elderlies outsmart the sadistic prison warden to escape.

Very Good Script.
Very good suspense
Very good musical score

My wife and I both loved it.

No need for over the top CGI/Special effects or graphic violence

Gave good examples of ethical men in extremely stressful circumstances where trust easily meant the difference between life and death.

God, prayer and ethics were even mentioned in the movie! (How dare they!) (Sarcasm definitely intended) Rare to see that in action movies these days. Glad to see that this movie did not have to measure up to the yardstick of ""political correctness"".

(My Two Cents)
Did not let prejudice by certain writers/film companies against older actors influence casting here. Way too much age discrimination in Hollywood in my opinion. Being in your 50s, 60s, 70s (See Robert Redford's latest film; ""All is Lost"") or even older should not be the main criterion for casting or creating screenplays. I am certainly not against younger stars but youth is too often overemphasized especially in choosing scripts that often include very few significant parts for older actors. Sadly, this is more the case in American cinema and most especially commercial American television which is really puerile in many ways.

Bravo to the filmmakers, actors, writers, and everybody else connected with this production.  As soon as my wife goes to bed, I am watching it again. (I rarely ever do that with movies!. So much tripe these days.)

6079702,4,B00GJFX8TA,"If you're in the mood for a great 80's style action movie, this is it.  Sly plays a world-weary security expert who makes a living breaking out of the toughest prisons.  Eventually he gets set up and ends up locked up for real in an Orwellian nightmare, where he has to work with a mysterious prisoner named Rottmayer (Arnie) in order to escape.

Fantastic teaming of Sly and Arnie.  Its incredible to watch these two sexagenerians still kicking butt.  Jim Caviziel is also great fun as the sadistic prison warden.  His stoic/spycho persona works great here.

I had to dock one star for the salty language throughout the movie which sometimes gives it that straight-to-DVD feel.  With a script this clever, it too bad the writer got lazy with the dialogue.  It's also weird hearing Jesus throw around F-bombs.  So beware if you watch this with younger kids.",1392595200,,857,4.72972972972973

Would've loved to see them do something like this in their heyday, but probably too big of egos back then by the both of them. Was great to see them work together. Would definitely watch this again.",1392595200,,312,4.288135593220339

6079712,4,B00GJFX8TA,A pretty good action movie although I'm completely over the Stallone-Swartzenegter combo. It's a good story and a novel plot.,1392595200,,125,5.3

6079719,1,B00GJFX8TA,Terrible movie. Stallone talks as if he had a mouth full of marbles. Plot of story is far fetched. Schwarzenegger should go back to politics.,1392508800,3,141,4.68
6079720,4,B00GJFX8TA,"2013 was a banner year for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone but few would know it.  ""The Last Stand"" and ""Bullet to the Head"" were homeruns but due to poor marketing fizzled at the box office.  Their winning streak continues with this joint venture that is a throwback to the heyday of great action flicks when these gents were box office kings.  The premise doesn't really hold water when you consider why anyone would  build a high tech detention facility to house the most undesirable of the undesirables when it would be much cheaper to dispatch said persons in other ways.  Granted, you wouldn't have a movie so why quibble.  Natch, our heroes have been set up by nefarious organizations so we have a real rooting interest for the bad guys getting their just desserts and Arnie and Sly are pros in that department.  What I like about this movie is it gets by on the charisma and machismo of its stars instead of CGI.  These guys are sculpted like men half their age.  Jim Caviezel looks like an American Ralph Fiennes in an oily turn as the sadistic warden.  Vinnie Jones, missing in action since his auspicious debut in ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"", has a menacing bit as a fearsome guard.  Fifty Cent plays Fifty Cent.  Not Oscar material but as old school action ""Escape Plan"" brings home the bacon.  Bring on ""Expendables 3"".",1392508800,,1356,4.670886075949367
6079721,4,B00GJFX8TA,This movie was much better than I had anticipated.  Stallone and Arnold make a great pair...and they don't take themselves too seriously.  Great action adventure movie.,1392422400,,168,5.423076923076923

6079723,5,B00GJFX8TA,"Very entertaining - and FUN!!!  Great to see Arnold out of politics and back doing what he does best...  entertaining in a larger than life role!  Sly is an excellent more serious foil to Arnold's lighter, funnier character.  They have aged as have I, but the love of doing what they do best is still there.  Don't listen to the negative critics.  If you like these two, you will like this film.  Some nice writing and witty twists as well.",1392422400,,440,4.425
6079724,4,B00GJFX8TA,"I had momentary flashbacks of Bruce Willis in Die Harder, Clint Eastwood in Gran Turino, and the most recent Steven Seagal movies; perhaps older action-movie heroes should either retire or take ""older"" roles instead of playing the action hero.

None-the-less, I quite enjoyed the movie. I confess that about 15 minutes into the CIA prison scenes I asked the wife ""wouldn't it be funny if this prison was (*plot spoiler removed*)'. Sure enough, a few minutes later he breaks out of isolation and the location is revealed.  Thinking back, somewhere in my past I read a similar sci-fi book except the location was, well, you know...

Anyhow, I think Sly's age works well for him here - his arthritic-looking hands make him look just like an aged prisoner. As for Arnold, I was expecting him to drop the big gun. Did we really need another hand-held minigun scene? Can't the guy just grab the grips like everyone else would?

The language was acceptable; the plot realism a bit hair raising; I thought this was fun to watch - not outstanding, but I will buy this when it hits the discount shelves.",1392422400,3,1093,4.706806282722513

But, not that interesting.  More like watching a show to kill time and being too lazy to turn it off.  Show was much less than I had thought from the previews.

When i purchased it and started to watch within 45min the movie stopped and the screen started to have an arrow turn in the middle like it was loading. It did this for about 5min untill a message came up saying the connection was bad try again. My connection wasn't bad because i was also online doing my taxes at that exact moment, so i knew it was the movie. I tried again and played it from that exact stop. From that moment on the movie would do the exact samething but this time every 5min. This is how i watched the movie.

6079745,3,B00GJFX8TA,"The 80s throwback nostalgia is enough to make you overlooked the monumentally ludicrous plot logic. The once invulnerable Arnie and Sly now look like they belong in a senior living facility instead of a high security prison and I found myself wincing every time somebody hit one of them and screaming at the TV. Walking frames aside, it's fun to see them back at what they do best and the lack of CGI allows every advantage of raiding 80s action tropes and reminding us how great those silly, macho, simplistic and excellent times really were.

But seriously, you can drive a truck through the plot holes, from the prison warden who reads the manual on building the escape-proof prison and then fails to implement any of the ideas, to the ""wait, why did they do that?"" moments that happen every few minutes. The big surprises are signposted from so far away that you'd have to be comatose not to see the ending coming. Ultimately the promised escape plan is pretty weak, with the bad guys boasting a firearm accuracy that the A-Team would be ashamed of, and a scene that demands Arnie screaming ""Geyt to da choppa!"" but it never happens.

Still, it's an entertaining yarn but I think real life prison wardens can sleep soundly at night. As for our heroes, the clock is clearly ticking on how long they can pull off these capers before they can no longer find stunt men old enough as body doubles and ""I'll be back"" becomes ""ow, my back"". So enjoy the admittedly entertaining ride and try to not to think to hard about afterwards.",1392336000,,1529,4.597069597069597

6079748,4,B00GJFX8TA,"After reading some of the one-star reviews, I have to say that those folks wanting to see a reboot of Commando or Rambo should get a clue.  Even though this has two major 80's action heroes, the primary point of the film is that brains trump brawn in most cases.  Of course there are fight scenes and the obligatory shoot-em-up, but the movie itself has a sort of surreal ""cube"" atmosphere that allows the viewer to journey with the characters in discovering the nature of their imprisonment.  There was great charisma between the primary characters, although I have to agree that there were two roles that were the equivalent of useless (looking at you, 50-cent) and probably should have had much more to do with the final escape and/or exposure of the corrupt facility.  The explanation of how he planned the escape and discovered their location was detailed and fairly sound, except for the mistake made in the Coriolis Force (don't want to put in spoilers, if you want to know what this references then look it up) that actually gave him a 50/50 chance of knowing their general location.  All in all a very enjoyable film.",1392336000,,1126,4.695431472081219

Okay so a bit of nostalgia caused me to watch it.  Not as technical or intense as it could have been, not a strong story line ( a bit confusing in the details) but you gotta love the spirit and tenacity of these two.

The Expendables is a great 80s throwback franchise, but is also about as smart as a box of rocks. Bullet to the Head was not a great script, Rambo was merely OK, where the first two were brilliant.

This movie, however, has a smart script, and a great cast being pushed to do their best. Schwarzenegger and Stallone work well together, and having Sam Neil, Jim Caviezel, Faran Tahir, Vinnie Jones, and Vincent D'Onofrio on board just makes the ride even better. If this was made 10 years ago, well, let's face it; 10 years ago nobody could have afforded to put Stallone and Schwarzenegger together in a movie.

6079756,4,B00GJFX8TA,"I wasn't expecting much when I heard of this movie. I figured it would be a B movie, with Stallone owning the competition and Schwarzenegger delivering some funny one liners. Well all of that was there, but it was good. Stallone's character proved to be a very smart character whom you cared for, and Schwarzenegger proved to be a very good addition to the movie and only had a single one liner.

As for the movie, it was a B movie, but it was a B movie that was made very well. Everything felt well written and the films pace and tone act accordingly. It was tense in the right areas, it was slow when needed and it was fast and furious when it should have been.

6079822,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape Plan was a nice surprise. This is a solid little action flick, a twist on the classic prison break film, with a great cast that, in addition to its two stars, features Vincent DOnofrio, Sam Neill, Amy Ryan, 50 Cent, and Jim Caviezel. Sylvester Stallone portrays Ray Breslin, a prison break specialist who literally wrote the book on escaping. For a fee, he will go undercover in a high security prison and find the holes. Breslin is in partnership with Vincent DOnofrio, who runs the business end of their company. When the CIA approaches them with a high fee offer to test a private off book prison for terrorists, the two leap at the opportunity. As you might imagine, things go awry and Breslin finds himself imprisoned for life who-knows-where, with no view of the outside, under the thumb of an evil warden and his murderous henchman. To add to Breslins woes, the prison is designed specifically around the suggestions in his own book, a copy of which sits on the wardens desk. Breslin almost immediately strikes up a wary friendship with the Schwarzenegger character, a rogue financiers right hand man who is being held in the prison until he reveals his bossess whereabouts. The two begin to plot an escape, although they have no idea where on Earth they are. How they find out is fun to watch, especially when Breslin constructs a simple sextant from odds and ends. How they use it, when they cannot see the stars, makes for one of the films more interesting alliances. There is a nice twist (the prison location) midway, and two twists at the end. One satisfactorily explains why the Schwarzenegger character warmed so quickly to Stallone, the other is no surprise, as everyone in the theater can see it coming for about an hour (Breslin, for all his demonstrations of genius intelligence, never figures out). One quibble: the villain is obvious to anyone who has seen a movie before, from the moment that actor appears onscreen, such is casting. But it is a quick, fun ride. What is most pleasing about the film is that Schwarzenegger and Stallone aren't playing their ages. These characters are portrayed as younger than the stars themselves, so we are spared all the old man references we got in The Last Stand. Thanks to makeup, hair, and lighting, it is easy to believe this film was shot fifteen to twenty years ago, so well do the stars carry it off.",1392076800,,2373,4.706730769230769

I ended up totally engaged in it and cheering Stallone on. It is similar to most prison like movies in that it has your bad gang, a go-to guy, and the new guy, the evil warden, and his gopher, but because it's Stallone and Arnold it was much more fun to watch.",1391990400,,390,4.077922077922078

Then after one of the pax asked what they were supposed to do, the helicopter pops into view, all guns blaring. If you have nothing else to do or watch, go for it.",1391990400,,501,4.397849462365591

Halfway through you knew exactly how everything would unfold. I could have went to the store, left the movie on, come back and not feel like I missed anything.

6079836,4,B00GJFX8TA,"In the ESCAPE PLAN, Sylvester Stallone portrays Ray Breslin, a man who makes his living by being sent into prisons to test their security levels. Hes the best of the best and actually wrote the book that all prison designers now use. When his partner, Lester Clark (Vincent DOnofrio) gets a hugely profitable contract with a company that has designed an international super-prison. The problem is that the prison is virtually off the grid and Breslin will have to work for awhile without the use of his team. Breslin agrees to the job. However, after his incarceration he realizes that he was set-up by someone and that breaking out of The Tomb is going to be much more difficult than anything hes ever done before. Not long after his arrival, he becomes acquainted with another inmate, Emil Rottmayer (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a political prisoner that the warden of The Tomb (Jim Cavizel) is determined to extract information from. Rottmayer agrees to help Breslin, but only on the condition that he gets to escape with him whenever Breslin does break out. Thus begins the action duo movie that people have been wanting to see since the mid-1980s.

I really enjoyed ESCAPE PLAN. I found it to be a well-written action movie, with classic elements of a heist picture. It reminded me of a cross between THE GREAT ESCAPE and an 1980s action movie. They don't make as many action movies as they did in the 1980s and 1990s . When they do, the movies are full of mostly CGI effects. Although there is some CGI in ESCAPE PLAN, its more of an old-school action film that relies about physical action instead of green-screened scenarios.

Movie fans will probably enjoy watching the ESCAPE PLAN if for no other reason that its finally the duo movie the Stallone and Schwarzenegger star in together. The two men had been rumored to be starring in a movie together since the 1980s, but it never happened. They did appear together on screen in the recent EXPENDABLES films, but Schwarzeneggers role was nothing more than a bloated cameo. ESCAPE PLANE is the movie where the audience finally gets to see them starring on screen together. Theyre both a bit more wizened and grizzled than they were back their action-starring days of the 1980s and 1990s, but that doesnt make the pleasure of seeing them on screen together any less.

Of course, even if you don't care about seeing Stallone and Schwarzenegger together in a movie, ESCAPE PLAN is still a pretty decent action/heist flick.

The DVD version of the movie includes an audio commentary with the director and one of the co-writers and a featurette entitled Executing the Plan: The Making of ESCAPE PLAN.",1391990400,,2648,4.800438596491228

6079840,5,B00GJFX8TA,"It reminded me of Escape From Alcatraz. Very clever writing as far as the obstacles were handled inside the prisons. The movie had a great opening scene and explanation. I liked the dry dead-pan humor also. Sly and Schwartz played off each other well. Jim Cavisel as the villain was solid too. He doesn't always shout like most typical bad guys in these movies, he has a queit, cunning demeanor. Toward the end the movie did get a bit over the top and unbelieveable, but I told myself to not dwell on it and enjoy the ride. Would definitely pop this in the player again.",1391990400,,570,4.438095238095238

I like a good action movie now and then but this was work! You can't understand about 70% of Stallone's dialog and the warden's of the ""Tank"" (Jim Caviezel) is almost completely made up of a mumbling whisper that is supposed to make him seem mean, but it's just annoying and confusing. Stallone and Schwarzenegger do a so-so job of convincing you they could actually take the abuse heaped on them by various bad guys. I think 50 cent dose some of the best acting in the whole movie and there are some real heavyweights like Sam Shepard, Vinnie Jones and Amy Ryan and others in supporting cast.

6079877,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Action movie buffs rejoice: Escape Plan features the long-awaited onscreen pairing of iconic 1980s muscle men Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. While these two action legends teamed up briefly in The Expendables franchise, Escape Plan is the first time they have done so in starring roles. The result? A satisfying B-movie that delivers just enough to compensate for some gaping plot holes and corny dialogue.

For decades action movie junkies dreamed of these two titans sharing the screen. Escape Plan is admittedly a bit of an odd choice for Stallone and Schwarzeneggers much-anticipated collaboration. Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom concentrates on building the suspense and only towards the end does the movie unleash the bullets, blood and mayhem that are the hallmarks of a Stallone or Schwarzenegger picture.

Fortunately, Escape Plan doesnt take itself too seriously. A quick glance at the movies synopsis confirms that this will not be another Shawshank Redemption. Stallone plays Ray Breslin, a structural security expert who literally wrote the book on designing escape-proof prisons. He earns his trade by intentionally getting locked up in prisons and subsequently devising clever ways to escape, thus exposing the design flaws to prison authorities. His latest assignment involves breaking out of The Tomb, a top secret, state-of-the-art prison that houses the worlds most dangerous criminals. Soon he realizes hes been double-crossed and thrown into a seemingly escape-proof prison run by a twisted warden (Jim Caviezel) with an axe to grind. Breslins only hope is to join forces with an enigmatic fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger) and turn the tables on the warden and his sadistic prison guards.

If you can buy Stallone as a high-security mastermind (you don't look that smart, Schwarzenegger quips) then you should be able to overlook the films obvious plot holes and cardboard characters. The two leads may be getting up there in age, but they have lost none of the charm or screen presence that made them famous. Stallone plays it straight, but Schwarzenegger is the scene-stealer here, delivering a live-wire performance as Rottmayer. Schwarzenegger looks like hes having the time of his life while ranting in his native German or mowing down bad guys with a huge machine gun. His enthusiasm carries the movie through to its predictably over-the-top finale.

At the end of the day, Escape Plan falls somewhere in the middle of Stallone and Schwarzeneggers cinematic oeuvre. It doesnt reach the highs of Rocky or The Terminator, but it also doesnt stoop to the lows of Judge Dredd or Batman & Robin. Despite a weak script and cheesy one-liners, Stallone and Schwarzenegger manage to carry it through to the finish line. It mostly aims to be good, dumb fun, and on that basis, it succeeds.",1391904000,,2836,5.253863134657837

Stallone and Ahnold play well together and the Warden comes off as appropriately evil, but not over-the-top crazy.  The plot line is reasonably obvious, with only one turn I didn't see coming (though it should have been obvious), but it did all stick together pretty well.  The action is fun and doesn't use a lot of CGI so it looks fairly real.  Some of the extra actors don't do a great job, but they aren't really on screen that much and it's not worth taking off more than a star given that all the rest of the movie was good.

6079916,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger return to do what they do best in Director Mikael Hfstrm's ""Escape Plan."" They kick butt, blow things up, kill a lot of folks, and rise victorious in the end. It's a fun ride fueled by enough testosterone to power a bulldozer and knows its target audience: men. Although it didn't fare well in the U.S. at the box office, Summit Entertainment gives audiences another chance to see the film at home on Blu-ray, DVD, or Digital Download.

Ray Breslin (Sylvester Stallone) spends his life breaking out of maximum security prisons. When he's asked to find a way to escape from a super-prison, he can't resist the challenge. After being locked up, Ray realizes he's been set up. His only chance of escape is with the help of a convict (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who wants out as bad as Breslin does.

""Escape Plan"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition (2.40:1). Its transfer will please home viewers with a clear picture. Most of the settings in the movie are dark and ominous, but don't lose any clarity.

A 7.1 DTS-HD Audio 7.1 Surround Sound mix is provided for ""Escape Plan."" It's a perfect way to plunge audiences into the ominously claustrophobic world the film is set in. Every door buzz, explosion, gunshot, and rush of water is systematically placed and comes out at you from every direction.

The Blu-ray version of ""Escape Plan"" comes with some interesting bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Mikael Hafstrom and Co-Writer Miles Chapman. Featurettes for the release include ""Executing the Plan: The Making of 'Escape Plan,'"" ""Maximum Security: The Real-Life Tomb,"" and ""Clash of the Titans."" Deleted scenes are found as well.

""Escape Plan"" is rated R for violence and language throughout. There are no sexual situations or nudity to be found. What we do get is a whole lot of shooting, stabbing, and bare-knuckle brawling. It's definitely NOT fun for the whole family.

If you're a big fan of overblown action films of the 1980s, you'll love ""Escape Plan."" Imagine Stuart Gordon's ""Fortress"" blended with ""Escape from Alcatraz"" and you have an idea of what to expect. It's not set in the future, but the technology used for the prison gives the film that sort of feeling.",1391558400,,2242,4.917989417989418

Awesome movie starring both STALLONE AND SCHWARZENEGGER as fellow inmates trying to make a break-out from a HIGH-TECH facility prison called THE TOMB designed by the creator himself. The action is incredible as the story shows how one man who makes a living breaking out of prisons gets trapped into one of his own creations. Now that is something to watch and learn.

6079925,2,B00GJFX8TA,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. A guy (Stallone)  is an expert at breaking out of prisons who uses his skill to show prisons where they made design mistakes.
2. He gets put into a prison that is much harder to get out of (and illegal)
3. His contact with his handlers is severed.
4. He works on getting out of prison and finding out who put him in such dire straits.

In a nutshell, there was just too much of this movie that was implausible. I can see that the target of the scriptwriters was for-profit prisons, but it seems like they tried to cover up a thin-as-gruel plot with excessive action scenes. That's not the first time I've seen something like that.

6079929,4,B00GJFX8TA,"Escape Plan is a fun action movie with two great stars: Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Ray Breslin is incarcerated in a master prison he designed himself and he needs to escape and find the person who put him behind bars. You get a Blu-Ray, DVD, and a Digital Ultra Violet HD copy of the film in this release. The picture quality is great and the audio quality is terrific. There is 70 minutes of total bonus content plus an audio commentary. The supplements are solid and entertaining too because Arnie and Sly had a great time working together. Escape Plan (formerly known as Exit Plan and The Tomb) was a huge success overseas since it opened at number one in many countries outside the US.

6079943,5,B00GJFX8TA,"Ok, I admit it:  when I first saw the trailer for ESCAPE PLAN a few months ago, I was one of the skeptics who thought it was another attempt at two aging action icons to simply get screen-time.  The story itself sounded interestingbut I wasn't so sure two actors like Stallone and Schwarzenegger could carry it.  Fortunately, I was dead wrong on my assumptions.  These two screen veterans help to make ESCAPE PLAN a taut and entertaining thrill-ride.

If you decide to watch ESCAPE PLAN, and I recommend that you do, be sure to go into it with the right mindset.  Youre not going to get Jason Bourne-like intrigue or see Donnie Yen-like action.  But instead, youll get bare-knuckles intensity from two legendary action-actors and a slick plot with twists and turns you won't see coming.

ESCAPE PLAN is shot well and the production value looks very high.  The sets look great, particularly The Tomb itself.  I am impressed with the lengths to which the production team went to make this set a viable and realistic looking prison.  I could definitely see something like this being used already.

The acting is what you would expect from Stallone and Schwarzenegger, although some of their supporting cast (specifically Curtis Jackson) didn't quite fit for me.  Others helped accentuate the authenticity of a prison setting, including Faran Tahir as a foreign prisoner and Vinnie Jones as a barbaric prison guard.

The story itself, however, is the real winner here.  I like the concept, right down to its core; and the twists and turns that are strewn throughout the plot only make the movie that much more enjoyable.  I enjoyed the way the movie ended and feel like everyone pretty much got what they deserved.

ESCAPE PLAN is a fun and energetic film that fans of either actor or those that enjoy straight-up action flicks will enjoy.  Full of wit and intensity, this movie should appeal to a variety of fans.  Be sure and snag the Blu-ray if you can; aside from the superior picture and sound quality, you get some great Special Features, including a couple of cool behind-the-scenes featurettes.

6079953,3,B00GJFX8TA,"While this is not a bad movie, I often wished I had had my own escape plan from the cost of this movie.  I got excited by the teaming up of my two action idols and made the purchase.  Now I am doing time financially.  Can't escape it.  But you can.  DO NOT BUY this movie.  Here's why:

1) The dialogue is absolutely terrible at some points.  Remember in the 80's when these two used to spout silly catch phrases and witty (?) comebacks?  Well, opportunities are manufactured for each of them to say things, but they say the lamest, most meaningless things to each other.  Almost as if they do not want to say something corny, but they have no writer to help them with wit!

2) The first half of the movie is more interesting.  The second half has better action.  The movie is just not that exciting all the way through.  If I explain more, I will dump spoilers, so maybe I should just say the film is unbalanced.

3) For a movie about escaping prisons, there is not much being done.  Two prisons.  A couple techniques exercised.  That's all.  Don't expect an intricate and interesting plot.  It's not bad, but this is no heist movie with many working parts that cause tension.

4) Incredibly predicable twist at the end.  Cheap even.  I expected better writing.  This is A-Team level writing.  (The TV show)

5) Unexplained character connections.  Why should we care about Stallone's crew?  Why do they care about each other?  No idea.  Why do Arnold's contacts help him?  Why do they have access to the hardware they bring?  No idea.

Is it entertaining?  Yes.  Is it deep and interesting?  No.  There are a few tense moments, some good violence, and that's it.  This is a superficial story which is really just an excuse to see two heroes act together.

Remember the thrill and promise of a good ride that Arnold and Carl Weathers meeting each other gave us in Predator?  That thrill is nowhere near this film.

A MUCH better escape movie is Escape from Alcatraz starring Clint Eastwood and it was written in the 1970's!",1390608000,15,2023,4.4930747922437675

6079955,3,B00GJFX8TA,"A lot of times, the trailers give you an idea of what the final product will be and the trailer for this one told me not to expect much.  It was what I thought it was - a lot of action and an old man (Stallone) who does not want to accept his senior citizen status!

I will not recount the story, but the film is the usual 'beat the clock' and 'on the run' action film.  It has some surprises and a few twists, but it is what you expect.  It is something to see, although the ultra modern prison is ugly and is the biggest turn-off.

The picture is perfect - it was clearly film in digital, so what do you expect?  It is hard watching Stallone as a senior with every vein in his body showing and Popeye forearms, yet he has the walk and body of Fred Sanford!  Arnold is much, much smaller muscle wise than in his younger days, so you know he was on the juice.  Stallone looks stronger and slightly bigger than Arnold does, and he has already been caught on the stuff a few years ago.

Stallone has to come to terms with the fact that he is an old man.  I know he is not Denzel when it comes to acting, but he does not have to be the top action man in the films you know.  He could just as well play a mentor.  Imagine a juiced up Fred Sanford with the same walk - that is Stallone these days.",1390521600,,1292,3.9269230769230767

6079959,3,B00GJFX8TA,"Great to see these two screen legends on the same screen, although that being said it is very odd. Each time they pan from Sly to Arnold it's like you're watching one of their own separate movies. Rarely do they actually ""feel"" like a team, like having De Niro and Pacino on the screen both at once (that was a failed attempt already). They both have their own great presence, so it's like watching two different films. Anyway, the concept is pretty cool, and a lot of the ideas Stallone comes up with are pretty cool, yet a bit far fetched, using milk cartons, cotton balls and basic pieces of metal just aren't very convincing for an ""Escape Plan"". The action is well paced, and the acting is good. Actually the worst being one of the better actors, Jim Caviezil. He just really doesn't cut it as an evil warden, Sam Neil on the other hand (who plays the doc), would have made an excellent bad guy. That's really one of the few downfalls of the movie.

It drops the basic F-bombs but nothing to overbearing. The violence is pretty minimal, and the gun play is pretty good as well, but not until you start getting towards the end of the film. They try to make you think through the majority of it. So all and all it's a pretty good action flick with some good scenes. That's about the extent of it, not much ""substance"", or storyline here. Although there is a nice surprise at the end. (wink)

Btw-Something funny on one of the other posters it shows them both standing in cells with machine guns. Oddly enough Stallone never touches a machine gun in the whole movie. And the only one Arnold uses is one he rips off of a helicopter and then COMMANDO is loose again!!! I actually like Arnold much better here, and he looks great for a 67 year old man. So enjoy, old school, with old timers.",1390348800,2,1790,4.372372372372372
6079960,5,B00GJFX8TA,Stallone and Schwartzenagger at their best. They may be old but they can still act and still have some punch left in them!,1390348800,,122,4.3478260869565215
6079961,1,B00GJFX8TA,"Listen, I'm both a huge fan of Stallone and Schwarzenegger. And seeing them team up with each other (for much more screen time together than The Expendables films) is one of those 'Finally, it has happened' moments.

It is just too bad that they teamed up for an Extremely Dull, Uneventful, and Boring piece of crap like this one.

Remember Face-Off? The film with Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, which had a small sequence in which both were on a prison ship that was in the middle of the Ocean? Take that, stretch it to a feature length running time, and then hire a director who doesn't know a thing about action films (his past directing features were movies like The Rite with Anthony Hopkins).

People keep saying this is an action film, but here is the question...what Action? A 30 second fight between Sly & Arnold which is played just for laughs, a handful (and I mean, you can count them in one hand) of fisticuffs filled with annoying shaky camera work, and a tedious ending which has Arnold spray the baddies with bullets...for about 40 seconds.

There is your action with these two Mega-stars of the Action Genre. Seriously, we waited Decades for this? A pointless subplot involving 50 cent and 'some girl' is just dull filler (why is it pointless? Because screen time is given to these two in their 'search for Sly', which ends up a big Nothing & Nada because Sly & Arnold escape on their own anyway. 50 cent and the girl never find Sly's location, they don't help him out...they are Completely Useless).

Sly, I love ya but in this flick you seem to be sleepwalking. You already did this part in Lock Up, a much better film with a much better performance with Stallone. The prison is nothing to write home about, especially when I can look at low budget affairs like 'Fortress' with Christopher Lambert and see that more was put into that little film than this $50 million production.

Boring, slow paced, a severe lack of action (The Last Stand has better and more memorable action set pieces than this flick), a lack of thrills, and much more make this a surprisingly Dull affair. No wonder it flopped so badly.",1390262400,7,2128,4.586842105263158
8623795,4,B00GJFX8TA,"VIEWER BEWARE: Apparently since the HD and SD versions are the same price - this streaming company pulled the ole switcheroo and gave me the SD version upon rental. I have played HD only for the past 6 years and I KNOW I rented the HD. The company must have made a few extra pennies by screwing me.

P.S. Movie was VERY GOOD but watching James Caviezel fondling the head of one of his employees creeped me out. He played a great warden but was far too PRISSY for my tastes. Vincent D'Onofrio only had one good role in his life and that was Full Metal Jacket. For those who had a problem with Curtis Jackson playing a 'NERDY THUG' - that was the best twist in casting this film. Overall a very good watch. However, having a bit of a problem with whether to watch the sequel with 47% hating it. I certainly won't rent that for $5.99.",1531958400,,831,4.226415094339623

The two musclemen have aged well and matured into pretty good actors, at least by comparison with their earlier days.
