7815568,4,6301801512,"I first saw this movie when I was like 10 and it was quite by accident, nothing better was on that particular day and there was no Cable! Ricky shroeder heavily depends on his moms to be there for him in practically every aspect of his growing life because his father is too busy with ""work"" and on business trips. I got the impression his father was there in name only and he rarely knew him, his mother suddenly gets gravily ill (they never really said with what but I am assumming cancer)he must then learn to adapt to life without his mother being there especially after she passes away. He suddenly has to build a relationship with his father in order to get them through this tough time and get on without her in their lives. It was really sad...a real tearjerker, Rick Shroeder is the master when it comes to making real tears (I don't think they sprayed anything in his eyes during the making of this one)
Overall I was feeling it, a nice family oriented movie from back in the day, I'd order it.",1027555200,9,1004,4.345744680851064
