These Sherlock Holmes movies feature Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. John H. Watson. Bruce has a passing resemblance to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but is used for comic relief, a slight drawback. Yes, this explains things to the audience. Many fans of the stories prefer the older settings even if this culture is unknown to them (horses, no central heating). The copyrights expired in 1970 so people are free to use these characters in new stories. Few are as good as the original, even if meant as a parody. Doyle was a student of criminology, some of the stories were based on actual crimes (The Valley of Fear). See the individual reviews for more details.
