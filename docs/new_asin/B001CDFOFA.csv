3508810,4,B001CDFOFA,"Sorry-WRONG-this is not an officially sanctioned set-it's what most raving anime fans call a ""bootleg""-but I disagree. Seeing as this particular season never made it to the us it's a viable option for those who don't feel like messing around with fansubs. Here's my take on it-the video is about 3.5 on a scale of 1 to 5-it's gotta be a laserdisc rip, it's soft and blurry-but the color balance is good, this is on 4 dvd9's-problem is they didn't use all 8 gigs of space available on the discs-the sound quality is about 4.2-pretty good-no noticeable hiss or distortion. The subs are excellent-I don't know what fansub script they used-but be aware that there are some missing lines on discs 3 & 4, not enough to seriously deter understanding what's being said-but enough to be irritating. All in all if you want to see Sailor Moon-Sailor Stars this is a very good way to do it. With the gender bending Sailor Starlights and the lesbian pairing of Uranus and Neptune preventing it from ever being licensed for general release here-but it sure would be nice if someone would. I wish Toei would get off their collective high horse and relicense it. Just don't get ripped off if you decide to buy this set-you shouldn't spend any more than 30 bucks for it.",1243641600,60,1253,4.623318385650224
3508811,5,B001CDFOFA,I have a Booth ia flea market.  A young lady and her uncle asked if I had DVDs.  She was learning Japanese by watching the series.  They do not have credit cards so I offered to order them on my Amazon account.  She was extremely happy to get this and since then more of the same venue.  It must be good or she wouldn't have ordered more.,1240963200,2,338,3.985074626865672
3508812,4,B001CDFOFA,This is overall a great buy. Very rarely the picture gets a tiny bit shaky but it's no big deal. On some episodes a line or two of subtitle is missing here and there which is not really a big deal except for episode 18 which is missing quite a bit of lines however you still get the gist of the episode. I highly recommend this though the packaging is quite nice and it sure has hell beats watching a crappy pixelated mess on youtube.,1232668800,20,434,4.117647058823529
3508813,5,B001CDFOFA,"This is the best bet for your money.  Since the studios refuse to release a professionally translated version of Sailorstars in the U.S., this bootleg edition is fantastic.  The dvd quality is very good and the subtitles are well done, with a few occasional slip-ups where a line or two was forgotten.  This set has no extras, but all 34 episodes of Sailorstars exist subtitled in English in all their glory.  A must have for any avid Moonie.",1230768000,,442,4.628205128205129
3508814,3,B001CDFOFA,"Actually Sailor Moon Sailor Stars has never been Dubbed English but if lucky you could find a Bootleg one with fansubs (It's better than nothing). Though you can watch the eps on Youtube. I doubt this set is English Subbed notheless Dubbed but if you can understand Japanese or even just understand the story by watching then you're good. Other than so US can't watch the Sailor Stars (The 5th Series) without some type of translation. (I want to see Sailor Stars as well, don't feel bad)

I only watch up to season Three. I have yet to see Four, Five and the Sailor R movie.",1220054400,3,575,4.4245283018867925

I first watched this streamed online. After buying this DVD set. its perfect! no audio or visual skips or issues, captions are great.

FYI this wasn't aired in the US so therefore it would make perfect sense why it was never dubbed!

Dont like it? oh well!

This dvd set didn't have any special features, which was fine.

if you're just looking to have a hard copy collection of sailor moon, then this is definitely a good purchase for you!",1424131200,,535,4.363636363636363

3508831,5,B001CDFOFA,The announcement was made at Anime Central 2014 this past weekend. Viz Media has acquire the streaming rights as well as the home video rights for North America release. This include all 200 episodes of Sailor Moon. All three Sailor Moon movies. The never before release Sailor Stars and the newer release Sailor Crystal which will broadcast in Japan in July. Plus other Sailor Moon OVA musical shows which were never release in the US and Canada. All digital enhance and un-cut in Blu-rays and DVDs with a brand new English dubbing cast using the original Japanese names from the show. The release date for the home video is later this fall. The streaming of Sailor Moon season one with Japanese English subtitled can be scene on Neon Alley and Hulu Plus.,1400716800,18,756,4.734848484848484
3508832,5,B001CDFOFA,"Listen I've had the DVD for years. If case you wonder why an official Sailor Moon Sailor Stars was never released in the US is because its a little to racy for the kids. #1 We all know Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus are lesbien lovers which was poorly covered up in season 3 by making them cousins in the English dub. #2 Someone obviously had an issue with the Sailor Stars being disguised as men but transformed into women, also more tongue and cheek lesbian stuff from Sailor Neptune and Uranus. I also lover Ranma 1/2 which if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it but also it has the whole gender bender thing going on but it is available in the US. So if you don't have access to a Japanese DVD player and actually want to watch a pretty decent season 5 Sailor Moon without having 10 years of schooling in the Japanese language under you're belt I highly recommend this DVD collection. The people who complain about the whole possible bootleg thing and the slightly shaking picture and slightly fuzzy subtitles have to much free time and need a life outside their living room. For everyone else who loves Sailor Moon but have things like a job, or a family, or go to school full time and you don't have time to research for hours about sailor moon and get a Japanese DVD player and learn Japanese for the sole purpose of watching anime this DVD pack is for you. Like most fans I had to know what happened after Sailor Moon SuperS (even though I had read the manga) and at the time being a broke full time college student, this was my only option. If you're curious after college I got a full time job so still no free time.",1399334400,2,1634,4.3257328990228014
3508833,5,B001CDFOFA,"I love sailor moon and I was so happy to be able to find a Japanese version with English subtitles (I can't stand the dubbed English versions). There was one little scratch on the last DVD but it only skipped for a few seconds so I don't mind. The subtitles are great, easy to read and understand. Love this product and would definitely reccomend to a friend!",1396742400,2,359,4.373134328358209
3508834,5,B001CDFOFA,"So far, all of the episodes and subtitles have worked as expected.
Looks great.

The graphics for the cover are a little over-saturated, though; this sort of issue is common with 'bootlegs'.",1390003200,,190,4.9375
3508835,4,B001CDFOFA,"Okay, so I didn't buy this exact dvd. But I got it off sailormoondvds.com which is an exact copy of this set. (If you are looking for a good set of the complete series of sailor moon ... Get it on sailormoondvds.com! All of the other seasons are exact copy's of the official adv/pioneer region 1 DVDs!) well anyways so this season is fantastic! But... Some of the subtitles are off. Like sometimes in certain episodes the character will speak and there will be no subtitles. But it shouldn't be an issue because you can kinda get what their saying by the plot of the episode and what the other character says next. My other issue is the video quality. It is like VHS quality. Which I'm not surprised because a. Sailor moon stars was never released in the u.s and b. it's from the 90s and it's a bootleg. But anyways if you want to see this season without sitting on your computer watching it on YouTube (which i don't know if all the episodes are available) I would buy this set or do what i did and get the complete series on sailormoondvds.com trust me it's worth it

3508836,2,B001CDFOFA,"This is it, the final season of Sailor Moon.  And I for one don't like it.  Although I feel that the anime greatly improved upon the manga for the first 3 years & some of the fourth, this is where the manga totally blows the anime away.  I know it has its fans, & if you enjoy it that's perfectly fine.  But I'm sorry, I did not.  If you haven't seen it, there are many spoilers ahead.

The season begins with the 6 part story arc I like to call Nehellenia's Revenge.  A mysterious benefactor frees Nehellenia from her curse.  She shatters her Dream Mirror and the shards either morph into Nehellenia clones or get in people's eyes, causing them to want to do nothing but look at themselves in mirrors.  The victims include Mamoru.  I have to admit this is a decent arc overall, despite some big flaws.  There are some Les Yay lines between Uranus & Neptune (the worst ones come later on in this season), Mamoru gets taken out easily by a villain he should have finished off, Chibiusa's ""death"" is good but nowhere near as strong as it was in the manga; but the worst part is the ending.  It's revealed Nehellenia only clung to her beauty because she believed that's the only reason anyone liked her, so the Sailor Senshi & Prince Endymion combined all their powers & gave her the chance to relive her life from when she was a child.

What.  The.  Heck?!

I think even Doctor Who would say this made no sense.  For starters, they forgive a person who committed genocide just to stay beautiful forever?  No, it's worse than genocide because the victims become the living dead & serve her until someone kills them.  And how come they can even do it in the first place?  The Inner Senshi's powers combined can't heal a dying person (like Saphir), but with the Outer Senshi they can rewrite time and space?  And finally, this should really mess up the continuity in one of 2 ways.  What if this back fired, & she prepared herself for the Sailor Senshi & took them out when the time came?  And even if this had worked, how come nothing changed?  If the Dead Moon Circus never came into being, they never would have met Pegasus, so shouldn't-gah, my head hurts!  Suffice to say, this where Sailor Moon basically went off the deep end for me.

And the sad thing is it was one of the 2 best parts of the season (we'll get to the other one at the end).  The main part of the season is where the show really went wrong.  A new boy band known as the Three Lights has come to town & with them the evil Shadow Galactica, a group consisting of Sailor Senshi gone bad, and the possibly heroic Sailor Starlights.  The evil Sailor Senshi were all well written villains (one of the very few improvements over the manga at all this season was giving Iron Mouse & Aluminum Siren actual characterizations, though Lead Crow & Tin Nyanko were 2 of the few manga villains with decent personalities that the anime expanded on, but Galaxia was MUCH better in the manga), but the Sailor Starlights are what's really wrong with this season.  First of all I have to admit that aside from what I'll say later, they were given better characterization than in the manga, but the manga versions were cooler.  Why?  In the manga, they were girls who cross dressed as boys but they were wholesome cross dressers.  Seiya only started dating Usagi because she thought she might be their princess.  In the anime, they're males who physically transform into female Sailors.  That was when Naoko Takeuchi, the creator, got really upset with the producers of the anime, & I don't blame her.  She said that only females can be Sailors, which gets no argument from me.  The anime raises way too many awkward questions, especially when Seiya really becomes romantically involved with Usagi.  The vast amount of fanfics pairing these two (often with the pairings Taiki/Ami & Yaten/Minako) just boggles the mind.  Aside from the fact that they're screwing up the timeline & giving poor, awesome Mamoru the shaft, these pairings are so messed up that I'd actually rather read stories where Mamoru marries Rei or even ones where Usagi falls in love with Prince Demando!  And that's sad, because most of the stories for these episodes were good apart from the gender bending issues & some really adult humor (like the one where they have a party at Usagi's house & everyone shows up; it's funny but some parts really made me cringe).  But one of the biggest flaws this season is the fights.  The Sailor Phages are hardly my favorite Monsters of the Week, but they were honestly fairly creative & a good way to extend the show.  But it really ticks me off just how much they downgraded Sailor Moon this season.  It shows in episode 194, during the fight with Sailor Tin Nyanko.  As one Youtube commenter noted, she had absolutely no offensive moves.  Just so you know in the manga, her attack for this season was a killing move.  Why couldn't they have made a different attack for healing people like they did in the first season?

And now we come to the finale, which is both the best & worst part of the season.  On its own, it is pretty strong, though the deaths of the Sailor Senshi were not nearly as heartbreaking as their deaths in the first season.  I could have lived without Sailor Moon & Sailor Galaxia getting naked at the end, but apart from that it was quite good (I know it's supposed to show purity & they looked like Barbie dolls but still, that was worse than the transformation sequences if you ask me).  But compared to the manga, it was nothing.  The Sailors were picked off 2 at a time, which really increased the tension.  Then Sailor Moon, Sailor Chibi Chibi, the Sailor Starlights, Princess Kakyuu Sailor Chibi Moon, AND the Amazoness Quartet all go to the end of the universe to face the villains, while in the anime our heroes just go to their local TV station.  And let me just say, the bit where Galaxia reanimates the dead Sailors & Tuxedo Mask always gets me.  Shame on them for not including that scene.  And of course, Galaxia & especially Chaos were much more complex villains in the manga.

I know we're supposed to judge each on its own merits, but the producers really botched it up this time.  I'm sorry to say this but the manga wins this time by a country mile.  However, I must admit that no matter what this was still very well produced technically, hence the 2 star rating.  The animation has never been better, the music was still good & the voice acting was excellent as always.  I'm really looking forward to the new Sailor Moon reboot now, especially since Naoko Takeuchi confirmed it would be closer to the manga.  While I don't think I'll enjoy the first 3 arcs as much as the original anime, I'm sure she won't let Toei make the same mistakes they did with the last 2 arcs.  I just hope they can get as many of the original actors back as possible.",1383177600,3,6848,4.476997578692494

3508839,3,B001CDFOFA,"I bought this a few years back knowing it would be a bootleg copy. That being said I actually bought the last Manga issue to find out how the Sailor Moon series ended before this DVD was available. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in how they ended the TV series as other reviews stated it really was a rehash of what was done in previous seasons. Bits and pieces of the Manga ending were used but not much. If you are a fan of Sailor Moon I say buy it to finally find out what we missed in the US, however I would suggest buying the Manga series to get the real ending.

The Manga is darker and the characters especially Serena is not as whiny and childish as shown in the TV series. Frankly, after reading the Manga I wish Sailor Moon would be rebooted only this time made directly off the Manga. If you have read the Manga you know exactly what I mean. The story arc for Sailor Stars would have made more sense had the writers kept to the Manga as it connected all the seasons together. Plus SPOILER ALERT******* Sailor Moon ending up nude and taking Galaxia's hand to end the fighting ( how stupid was that???) never happens.",1378857600,,1135,4.303738317757009

3508862,4,B001CDFOFA,"I first started watching Sailor Moon as a child (like many people, it was my gateway into anime.) When I got older and realized there were five seasons, I was ecstatic! That is, until I realized that it had never been dubbed in our country. And so I knew I would have to go to the ""underbelly"" of the anime world, go against my morals, and buy a bootleg.

And, despite my initial worries, I was pleasantly surprised!
The packaging itself is wonderful, not even my fellow anime loving friends could tell it was a bootleg at first. The only big packagaing tipoff is, in a little section on the back cover that lists character's names, Artemis is misspelled as Aramis.

Unlike official anime releases, which give you the scene selection choice of Opening, Part A, Part B, and Ending, this only gives you a very simplistic episode selection with the title cards, which are unforunately in Japanese. So unless you can read the characters, you'll have to do what I did and print an episode list off a fansite, or Wikipedia. You also have to hit the menu button on a couple of the dvds, as they start playing automatically.

Another little issue is occasional problems with the subtitles, which is most heavily present in three episodes. Firstly in ""A Farewell and an Encounter! The Destiny of Flowing Stars"", the last episode to feature Nehelenia. The subtitles for the last bit of the episode start playing as the senshi are reforming her, so while she's talking about wanting to start over, you see subtitles underneath talking about her falling asleep. If I hadn't seen these screencapped beforehand, I wouldn't have known what was going on. Secondly in ""A Storm at School! Transfer Students are Idols"", the episode where the football player becomes a Phage. The subtitles are very off, and continually say something about fish, I believe? I haven't rewatched that particular episode lately, so I'm guessing it was a sign in the background. Lastly, in ""Night Between Us! Usagi's Pinch"", the episode where Seiya ends up at Usagi's house, and the night ends up crazy as everyone else shows up as well. There are many parts where people are speaking and there are absolutely no subtitles at all. This is the one that upsets me the most, as I want to know what's going on between the characters. Sometimes, as well, I feel like subtitles don't display all of what a character is saying, as they're speaking at great length while the subtitle is only maybe three sentences long.

The biggest problem I had is that one episode went a little jumpy on me, specifically ""The Scream of Dead Souls? Terror of a Monster at Camp"", in which the Three Lights are filming an action movie, and the Phage is Rei's cousin Kengo. It isn't my favorite and it doesn't drive the plot at all anyway; I tend to skip it. But if someone ever wanted to borrow my set, they might want to see it.

Overall, this gets an 8/10 for me. One point deducted for subtitle issues, and one for the skipping episode. I'm glad to have finally been able to see Stars, and it's a great season!

On a side note, as excited as I am for the 2013 reboot of my beloved BSSM, I wish they would at least release this officially with subtitles in the US, as the original Monster Of The Day format is the Sailor Moon I grew up with. Perhaps a box set for each of the five seasons? Viz Media has apparently just acquired the rights for releasing the show in Germany, so I'm hoping they'll work on an American release as well!",1354147200,3,3469,4.551282051282051

3508866,4,B001CDFOFA,"At least a chance to own the final season of Sailor Moon and this final season is well worth seeing. The season starts off with the return of the dark moon circus queen from Sailor moon super s wanting revenge of Sailor Moon. The girls are now in High School and Lita finally is in the same uniform as her class mates. Rei goes to another school with a different uniform. The queen begins with infecting Darien (Mamoru) and getting Serena (Usagi) all worried. The new power of the queen is enough to reawaken Sailor Saturn who speaks to the scouts of a sailor war.

After the queen is dealt with and peace has restored to the girls lives Mamoru goes off to study in America though with the new Queen Galaxy attack it is unsure if he ever get there. The three lights music group (who is really the sailor stars) show up along with other characters calling themselves sailor soldiers like Sailor Iron Mouse. There are some stuff in this season that are like the events of previous season as other reviewers have noted as well as some interesting differences such as Usagi not being such a cry baby.  I would like to mention that I have always wondered what become of Melvin and Molly characters since the early seasons.

There is only a couple of things that causes me to down rate the set. The first is that the disks are stacked atop of each other. I seen it done in double and triple feature sets and never cared for it in fear of the disks getting scratched up.  The other complaint I have is that you have to turn on the subtitles each time you put the disk in.",1314576000,2,1564,4.32764505119454
3508867,1,B001CDFOFA,"Is this season really supposed to be better than SuperS. No way, in what world? SuperS was extremely creepy, and had an original story. This season does not; it is in fact mostly the same as Super, except it sucks horribly.

There are at least 11 very wrong things with this season.

#1. The plot and the ending. A unbelievably powerful Sailor Soldier needs all the star seeds to have destroyed the universe. ""Sailor Galaxia"" is actually Sailor Sun, but has the force of ""Chaos"" inside her. This already happened three times. In Sailor Moon S, Hotaru was actually Sailor Saturn, but the real evil force was ""Mistress 9"" who needed pure heart crystals to be resurrected. Chaos"" is basically a ghost version of the ""Death Phantom"" from Sailor Moon R, or a non-fireball version of Pharaoh 90 from S. .Worse, this season downplays past seasons saying ""this is a galactic war"" while the others were ""insignificant."" Because destroying everyone's dreams, destroying the universe, destroying the future, was apparently a simple matter. In the very end, it literally goes with Sailor Moon naked taking Galaxia's hand. Really. This teaches everyone that if you strip naked, all will be overcome and the world will be saved. Or rather, Toei Animation saved most of the US audience by not dubbing this season, but not those poisoned by attempts to watch it on youtube.

#2. Where are the ""Asteroid"" Sailors? Or Sailor Papillion? The ""Asteroid"" Sailors were seen in Sailor Moon Super S, the previous season, as the ""Amazon Quartet,"" four girls stolen from the dream world meant to rest until Rini (sailor moon's daughter) reigns as queen. They were woken up and became enemies, but came over to the good side. Now being awake, the logical step was for them to became sailors, like ""Sailor Ceres"" (the biggest moon besides Earth's moon). Someone's bright idea was to write them out entirely, along with an all-black wearing traitor working with Galaxia named ""Papillion"" from another universe.
This is the only one that can be entirely blamed on the anime, not the Manga.

#3. The terms ""Pure Heart Crystal"" and ""Star Seed."" Can anyone spot a difference? One comes out of your heart's area, the other from a flower from your head. Both can be corrupted/stolen etc. Um, a flower in your head? A dream mirror to see you dreams is one thing. The star seeds are repetitive, and essentially useless as a weapon. They literally sit in Sailor Galaxia's collection, while finding the golden dream mirror involved grants you the golden crystal which can be used to rule the universe, or pure heart crystals that finding the right one literally involves finding the holy grail/purity chalice. Star seeds could make shiny gifts that you cannot give to your friends because they turn black and get really ugly. They became ""poisoned"" when exposed.

#4.  Rini aka Serena/Darien's daughter goes home. The second Darien dies, she would disappear. The future is screwed. This is basically never mentioned. Her absence is quite ridiculous, given the fact that she saved the world in Super S, and was it's main character.

#5. So there is basically no Tuxedo mask. No guy entering the vampire disco to save the day, to literally throw spiked roses through monsters and villains, or to unleash cool theme music. And he is not the only main character who leaves.

#6. Sailor Moon/Serena gives Darien/Tuxedo Mask the finger after approximately one week of no letters. He goes to America to pursue further learning (why is never told), and is captured and killed by Galaxia, a plane hijacked. Serena dates Sieya, one of the Sailor Transvestites. She could've at least chose Sailor Star Healer, who looks like a young version of Jamie Lee Curtis.

#7. The Sailor Starlight's are men normally. Yes, men who literally transform into women. Technically ""Tuxedo Mask"" is ""Sailor Earth"" in a vampire disco outfit, but this is out of control. Transformed or not, at least two of them look like repulsive transvestites. A gross alien from Dragonball Z, Freiza, is far more attractive.

#8. The Sailor Starlight's are beyond useless as characters. They are trying to find their ""princess"" (we've heard this before, twice!) but are only concerned with that and killing Sailor Galaxia (oh no; another evil sailor-see #1). Separate from others, they have conflicts of interest. This is less interesting and identical to Sailor Moon S, in which Sailor Neptune, Uranus, and Pluto have a separate mission to do what must be done rather than fighting for ""peace and justice."" It was done far better during the show's arguably best season (Sailor Moon S).

#9. Sailor Moon becomes ""Eternal Sailor Moon,"" and actually has wings in this form. But she cannot fly unless Pegasus (from Supers) were to return, so they are just fancy items that limit mobility in combat. But this doesn't matter (see #10). Notably, the season also takes place in the summer. Her outfit is quite thick, yet during winter seasons she never had anything on.

#10. ""Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss,"" unlike previous attacks, is nor flashy nor exciting. She basically twirls an oversized moon scepter (like we didn't see Scepter's in R and S). One could go into a coma waiting for this attack to end.

#11. Unlike previous seasons, it does not take effort from any other Sailor to beat the enemy, in this season called ""Phages."" One hit from her attack, and they are done, no weakening or efforts to knock them down or hold. In other words, having Sailor Saturn around, one called ""the sovereign of silence,"" or ""the sailor scout of destruction,"" who can destroy all life and start over again, or the load of the stronger sailors from S around, is completely pointless.

One positive point: The first six episodes involve Sailor Galaxia unleashing Nelhelenia to get revenge and take out all of the current universe Sailors. Nelhelenia is a jealous, bitter woman who hates their guts. She throws glass at the earth. She rocks. Also, Sailor Saturn returns and strikes with fury, using ""Silence Wall,"" and ""Silence Grave Suprise"" in one of the series best episodes. The rest is down-right garbage.",1309651200,2,6115,4.907066795740562
3508888,3,B001CDFOFA,"Okay people first let me point out we are lucky to even get this 'final season' of the acclaimed sailor moon available in the US. AND if you are not a sailor moon fan get of this page because you're dropping in on the final act and will not understand most of it or what a wonderful anime this turned out to become.
Final warning.......Okay, now it's not an *officially licensed* US release because there is not one and might never be so grab it while you still can.

Two stories take place, the first is to defeat an old enemy thought to be gone and is very well put together with all the action and heart stopping moments you would hope for (I will not give spoilers so no worries)!! The second and longer story involves a threat from outside the galaxy that has found earth to wreak havoc. New sailors and new powers combine with a very interesting relationship that develops and will bring an 'edge of your seat' feeling. I can say without a doubt you will not be disappointed. Though some of these episodes can be found on youtube it's best in full dvd viewing.

Now on to the disc box set itself.....okay so maybe it's not the best but the sound, subtitles and picture are good enough to be able to immerse yourself into the story just fine. If there is some missing subtitles it doesn't effect the overall understanding of the plot at all. So if you are the fan who must see how it all ends stop reading this and BUY IT NOW!!!",1304035200,3,1433,4.303703703703704
3508889,4,B001CDFOFA,This disc set is perfect. I love sailor moon with all my heart. But the only problem with it is that episode 22 keeps skipping in one of the parts. I have tried cleaning it and fixing it. I have never watched the dvd at all. It was the 1st time i actually watched it. I do not know what could be wrong. Now I have to go and try and find the cd with the episodes on it. I really loved this set though. Has anyone else had this problem.,1297296000,2,434,3.78021978021978
3508890,1,B001CDFOFA,I have recently purchased a copy of this product off of another site. After receiving the product i did some research. This season of sailor moon which is Sailor Moon Sailor Stars was never released for Region 1 which is a U.S. release. The product i received was on 4 disc on one spindal. Cover art appeared to be printed off the computer due to the dullness. Disc on this boxset were all region coded. Some of the subtitles on the episodes appear to have english and chinese subtitles. Sound is okay Video gets blurry at times.,1296864000,,529,4.463917525773196

3508893,1,B001CDFOFA,"Just to be clear, my giving this prouduct one star is based not on the content of the show itself (that would get five stars, this is quite possibly the best season of the show) but on the nature (and legality) of the prouduct itself.

Hopefully someday it will happen... probably a pipe dream, I know. But as of this writing, there has NEVER been an official R1 release of Sailor Stars. This is a BOOTLEG, people, plain and simple. I know what some of you are going to say. ""But I really want to see it, and if they aren't going to release it, then I'll have to buy a bootleg!""

To that, I say balderdash. Why pay money for what is basically a stolen property? This is the internet, people! I'm sure you can find another way of getting it that does not involve parting with your hard earned money to support piracy. (While I admit nothing, I will say that I may or may not have seen Stars myself, and if I did do so it may or may not have involved something that rhymes with a bankrupt tree herder, or rather, a poor Ent.)

I say support official releases as much as possible. As far as Sailor Moon goes, I have ADV's release of the first two seasons and Pioneer's/Geneon's releases of the second two seasons and the movies. It is in part the lack of support of official releases that is the reason that the domestic anime market is in something of a dire situation. You want to keep having access to anime? Pay for it in a way that supports the industry, not in a way that just lines some bootleger's pockets.

That all being said, it is a sad fact is that there are some things out there extremely unlikely to see domestic release, such as Macross: Do You Remember Love? or this very product, Sailor Stars. Don't financially support the pirates looking to take advantage of the fandom! Look for free fansubs produced purely for the love of the product and the eagerness to see it shared.",1279065600,11,1890,4.3154929577464785
3508894,5,B001CDFOFA,I recently watched Sailor Moon on Youtube and got so into it I watched the final season in Japanese.  It was great I loved the story it moved fast.  Plus the end was great it left you satisfied.  This box set is great.  Only thing is sometimes the subtitles are wrong or someone typed randomness.  Other than that very enjoyable.

The only things wrong with it is, on a couple discs, there is no menu to start the disc, and during the show on a couple discs, there are missing subtitle lines from the show, but not enough to make you miss out on anything important. Also, the theme song subtitles have a few missing lines on a couple discs. Rather than that, it is a pretty good bootleg.
