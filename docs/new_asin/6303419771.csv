640218,4,6303419771,"This is actually quite a charming little holiday movie that is not well known.  Nick Cage, John Lovitz and Dana Carvey play three brothers.  Lovitz and Carvey just get out of prison and convince their brother to go to little Paradise, Pa during Christmas to deliver a note from a fellow inmate to his daughter.
Of course, the hidden agenda is that they know there is a bank there that is just ripe to be robbed.  After convincing Brother Nick who wants to go straight, the three pull off the job.
unfortunately, a huge snow storm prevents them from getting out of town.  After their car crashes, they found themselves aided and taken in by no less than the Bank President and his family.
After seeing how nice the people of Paradise are, they decide to try and put the money back.  Meanwhile, a mobster inmate has escaped Prison and abducts the brothers mom as the bank job was his idea.
This is really a pretty funny movie.  I've wondered why it doesn't pop up more at Christmas time as it does have a very strong Christmas spirit to it.",1073865600,25,1038,4.436842105263158
640219,4,6303419771,"3 brothers (Nicholas Cage, Dana Carvey, and Jon Lovitz) heist a bank in a little town known as Paradise.  After robbing the bank, Cage, Lovitz, and Carvey find it rather difficult to leave with the money due to the FBI, their kidnapped mother, and two local police officers whose liscence plate begins with DUH! They constantly run into the locals who live a quaint little lifestyle and are always willing to lend a helping hand.  With the starring of Cage, Carvey, and Lovitz, you'd think that it would be a hysterical movie.  After watching it, the movie does have some funny moments,and the entire idea is kind of quirky, but overall it's not as funny as one would project.  However, the movie is very compelling and it sucks you in.  It really makes you want to move to Paradise!!! Overall it's a fun and chrarming movie that you could watch snuggled up to your loved one or with your kids.",1055980800,11,894,4.5625

640222,1,6303419771,"It's hard for me to believe that this movie has received an average Amazon rate of 4 stars.  It makes me wonder if the same person hasn't written in 7 or 8 times. I am a devoted Cage fan, and so went into this film with high expectations. As a whole, I found the film a complete disappointment. The gags were weary, the dialogue was tiresome, and the plot was thin. Even the slapstick style humor was weak; almost Benny Hill-esque. The only reason to buy this film is to complete a Cage or Carvey collection, and even then, I'd make it last on the list. Everyone in this film has done better, funnier work. If you're really considering buying it, take your ten bucks down the street and give it to some homeless guy, or buy a handful of lottery tickets, or anything else at all.",1007510400,7,778,4.292517006802721

640576,3,6303419771,"I saw Trapped in Paradise when it first came out, and then recently decided to revisit with my wife, as she had never seen it and I remembered finding it pretty funny when it first came out. After viewing it years later, it's still pretty amusing. It should probably be more like 3.5 stars instead of four, but Amazon don't play that way, so we will go with 3 and err on the side of caution.

Trapped in Paradise falls into the trope of Christmas redemption movies, wherein three brothers (played by Nic Cage, Dana Carvey, and Jon Lovitz) in varying stages of moral decay decide to rob a small town bank on Christmas Eve. Things go haywire, of course, and the brothers are forced to come to terms with who they are and how their actions impact others.

The humor is all over the place, but usually is in the form of quips between the brothers, which is sometimes smile-worthy, but falls short when compared to the circumstantial humor and site-gags, which play out better. Also, it has to be said that this IS a Nic Cage movie, with all that entails. He's just as over the top here as he is anywhere else. If you don't like Nicholas Cage (or cannot tolerate him), then you probably won't like this movie. Dana Carvey comes off a little over the top, but then settles into his role as the movie progresses. His character here is nowhere near the quality of Garth Algar or George Herbert Walker Bush impersonation, but it's likable.

And that's a good word for this movie: likable. It's not hilarious, it's not the greatest Christmas tale ever told, and it's not even particularly well acted (the town members are probably the best actors in the bunch). It also suffers for an unnecessary and poorly-explained romance between Nic Cage and one of the townsfolk, but that's Hollywood for you.  Despite these shortcomings, the movie overall feels complete and of good cheer. Worth it if you're looking for something different this holiday season, or just want to pull an old Nic Cage movie out of the vault.",1482105600,2,2002,4.583798882681564

641747,4,6303419771,"As Christmas movies go, this one is pretty good. True, there are some extreme stereotypes of the 'dumb' guy, more than one in a film is overdoing it, even one is hard to bear, but it detracts only a bit from the fun. Besides which, this is a Christmas movie, nobody expects it to be a display of gritty reality. So, yes, it is unbelievable. So What! Nicholas Cage manages to keep his feet in the middle of all the nonsensical, sometimes touching, going ons, and that is probably the single most important reason it doesn't fall flat. Aside from that, perhaps, we all have a tendency to go easy on a seasonal offering, as long as it does offer something besides sentimentality. This one does, by way of three of the goofiest bank robbers in film history, with a kind of suggestion of real mayhem as some pepper in the goulash. At any rate, with moments of uneasiness created by the ""dumb"" characters, these are not good days for overdoing such simple-minded characterizations, it was an enjoyable though far from a sensational outing. Certainly good for an evening's viewing if the price is right.",1383868800,,1096,4.625641025641026

(The title refers to Paradise, Pennsylvania, where they stage the robbery.)  The writing is punctuated with an abundance of crude language, Nicolas Cage's character gets cranky to the point I didn't like him, and Dana Carvey's retarded-sounding kleptomaniac overdoes his silly laugh.  The music was well-written, but the script wasn't, which hurt the chemistry of the cast members and made the movie annoying to me:  an awkward blend of crudeness and sentimentality.",1363910400,2,845,5.043165467625899

641905,5,6303419771,"And this is the next review in my Cage-a-thon. Actually, I saw this movie many years ago, but watched it again recently because it's a fun film. Nothing that will leave you in stitches from laughing like a maniac, but it's not boring either. It's...it's silly. That's the best way to describe it - not meant to make you bust a gut, but not something that tries way too hard to make you laugh and fails miserably. (Warning, this review will contain spoilers).

A short summary: Three brothers rob an ill-guarded bank, have a change of heart and give it back. I personally loved the three main characters - great development and a nice variety. There's Bill Firpo, played by Nicolas Cage. He's the responsible brother and I'm assuming the eldest. He the seemingly honest working stiff who secretly fights his urges to commit crimes so he doesn't end up like his siblings, Dave and Alvin. These two, played by Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey, respectively, are doing time for robbery or theft. Dave Firpo is a pathological liar who is responsible for most of the mischief in the film, and Alvin is a kleptomaniac. I don't think better actors could have been picked for these roles. The trouble starts when Dave and Alvin are released on parole early for the holidays due to over-crowding.

After Dave convinces Bill he's a wanted man in New York and they need to get outta dodge, they hit up a bank in a nice little Pennsylvania town called Paradise on Christmas Eve. The kind of town where everyone knows everyone and you can leave your doors unlocked at night. From what I can tell, Dave heard of this place from another inmate and wanted to rob the place before someone else did. So he sets up an elaborate scheme to make Bill think he's a wanted man and they need to leave their home state of New York.

The bank robbery scene is probably my favorite part of the film because these three are total idiots. In a nutshell, these three get to know the bank president and his family and they feel bad for robbing such good people and putting the bank in danger of being shut down. So they give the money back without saying who they were, and as a result, the townspeople refuse to identify the Firpos as the robbers. Since, you know, that would happen in real life and all. They learn their lesson, Cage gets the girl, The End. The side romance is kind of boring because the character Sarah Mazucci/Collins is rather bland.

I can't really say there's anything bad about this movie. Maybe not the kind of thing you'd expect to see Nicolas Cage starring in (though I think he does well in humorous roles), but hey, he's done MUCH worse *cough-TheFamilyMan-cough*.

From an aesthetic viewpoint, the movie is shot very nicely. Camera angles aren't boring, the music works, costume design was nice, sound quality is good. It's by no means an edge-of-your-seat exciting story, it's not thrilling. It's one of those movies you can watch with your parents and not have to worry about that awkward sex scene popping up and making the weirdness in the room thick enough to cut with a knife. And, of course, if you like Christmas films, this one's not reeking of the spirit, but it's alright to watch not only in December, but any time of the year. If this is your kind of movie or you like any of the main actors, I'd say give this film a try. It might be something you find in the bargain bin, but give it a chance. I found Serial Mom in the bargain bin and I love that movie; don't always let a low price dictate film quality.",1335484800,,3512,4.489827856025039

642019,2,6303419771,"Nicolas Cage has made some of the best movies I've ever seen - ""Raising Arizona"" in particular is near and dear to my heart, but ""Lord of War"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" also belong in the pantheon of Movies Worth Seeing.

I can only imagine that his younger self was dreaming of movies like those while he was schlepping away on ""Trapped in Paradise.""  Working along side ""SNL"" alums Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz, who never turned their TV promise into Hollywood magic (excepting Carvey's Garth, of course, but that was a mere extension of his SNL character), Cage gets to go through the motions in this formulaic caper-comedy.

Cage plays the straightest of three crooked brothers.  Lovitz is - shockingly - a lying boor and Carvey is a kleptomaniac whose most annoying feature isn't his need to steal, it's his grating voice.  I don't use their characters' names because they are completely irrelevant and never emerge as characters in their own right.  Through a cock-and-bull story Lovitz convinces Cage to go along on the world's easiest bank robbery.  But this is a Christmas movie - and one without the savage glee of ""The Ref"" - so after knocking over the only bank in a small town full of Small Town Goodness, Cage and his brothers get religion and try to give the money back.

Supposedly-comic hi-jinx ensue, but to little end, no purpose, and fewer laughs.  A ""dramatic"" high-speed chase involving inept policemen, FBI agents, and a horse-drawn sleigh is so obviously-staged you can almost see the stage hands blowing snow in the actors' faces during closeups while the stunt guys are plainly visible during the action shots.

A laughingly half-hearted romance clogs up what remains of this surprisingly profane movie, which except for some gratuitous swearing belongs squarely in the safe PG bin.

If you're looking for a good holiday film and you've worn out your copy of ""A Christmas Story,"" stay away from this one.  Watching the holiday special for ""Iron Chef America:  Battle Egg Nog"" is time better spent.

The movie is saved from one star only by my hunch that the sunglasses Cage dons during the robbery are the same shades he wore in ""Valley Girl.""  Not exactly a high point for cinema, but a high water mark for this movie.",1261612800,2,2241,4.769430051813472

Because not only is it a fun and funny movie with loads of talent, it has the best Christmas scenes too!  Seeing the people give their gifts to these 3 brothers just because they are in need of dry clothes after they end up crashing into the river, is so awesome! It's all part of the movie, that the people they stole from are the nicest people in the world, and truly celebrate Christmas in their hearts.  It makes these 3 end up doing the right thing.  But before they do, you'll be laughing more than once.  At first you think no one could be that stupid, but thats why 2 of them were in Prison, but it works, the talent just makes it work, but mostly its just great fun. This movie is so re watchable, every year I enjoy it as one of the first Christmas movies I watch, just as the season nears. It isn't ""only"" about Christmas, but Christmas is played into it, so in a roundabout way, it's more of a Christmas movie than most proclaimed Christmas movies!  They even get to evade the cops at one part by making off in a horse drawn sleigh, its just one more Chrismassy effect and thats part of how it stays so seasonal.  If you don't like this movie, you were probably already miserable and nothing would have made you happy anyway!  which is probably why some people give it only one or two stars. Nicolas Cage plays the straight guy, which works fine, and I'm sure there really are two characters out there somewhere in the world just like his 2 brothers, played by Lovitz and Carry. In that sense its believable. This would have easily been a 4 star movie, but some scenes are just too excellent, so you just have to throw that fifth star in there.  Whether you buy it, rent it, or get it loaned for free, you'll enjoy it if you watch it! This is a movie that if my DVD got smashed somehow, I'd definitely buy another one.

All they need is a little help once they get outside.  The help is in the form of thier somewhat honest brother (cage).

The movie has the feel of one of those forties or fifties charmers, where the bad guys aren't so bad and they become good guys once they realize what life is really all about.

While the leads (Nicolas Cage, Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz) are all very good, the movie's heart lies in the supporting performances:  Florence Stanley as the boys' potty-mouthed mom; Donald Moffatt and Angela Paton as the Andersons, the bank president and his wife who unbeknownst to them are having the bank robbers for Christmas dinner; Madchen Amick (Twin Peaks) as the convict's sweet daughter; John Ashton as the redneck deputy; and Richard Jenkins as the putupon FBI agent.  The scene where the bus depot clerk gives the duplicitous Cage enough money to get his ticket home is heart tugging, showing just how nice the people of Paradise really are.

After the movie hit theaters, all of the reviews were negative as if the movie featured a cast of unknowns instead of three very well established entertainers, two of whom are very gifted comedians.  While all three actors have had better roles, they work well together with Cage being the straight man to Lovitz and Carvey's comedic banter.  Yes, I realize that the premise of this movie is somewhat far fetched, but that's why it's a movie and not a news story.  The movie has its fair share of laughs with a healthy dose of Christmas spirit.  It gets watched every holiday season at my house, and I recommend it to anyone who is capable of watching a movie and being OK with the fact that it is a work of FICTION!
