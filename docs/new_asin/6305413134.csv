1024170,3,6305413134,"Good movie, but I didn't like that some scenes were cut such as the trip from the airport to the desert",1357430400,,103,3.9523809523809526
1024171,2,6305413134,"I have been a Rutger Hauer fan since Ladyhawke and Blind Fury, so after reading the plot and some reviews of Beyond Justics, I assumed it would be a pretty good movie. Oh boy was I wrong. The movie itself is barely OK, some good action scenes, but a pretty weak plot and the action scenes looked as if they were shot in the 70s and not in the 90s. But the quality of the DVD was terrible. The cover was cheaply done, not even printed right, and the DVD quality was grainy, worse than copying VHS to DVD, and the sound was horrid. It's beyond me how amazon.com can sell such a low quality product. Keep your VHS if you like the movie.",1313107200,8,633,4.112903225806452
1024172,1,6305413134,"Supermodel, actress and model Carol Alt is one hot model. Dolph  Lungren is great actor. Omar Sharif is also a great actor. Ennio Morricone provides a beautiful soundtrack to some other movie which is not this one. Either that or someone put all of the music in the wrong place accidentally. There were at least 2 great Mercedes Benzes featured in this film. Carol Alt is very convincing as a long leggy, powerful media mogul in skirt suits. I found the camel sounds to be very realistic. Omar Sharif rides a white stallion brilliantly. The other guys really don't get much development as characters, which too bad because most of them don't die. I was totally unconvinced by one cheap prop in particular, which was the stinger missile. It was a plumbing pipe, painted black with a handle taped to it. If that's a stinger missile, then I have ten of them.  There were some explosions which looked quite good. And a sandstorm which could have been better. But there were lots of camels and horses. One horse was definitely injured during filming, at least emotionally. How would you like if some one snuck out from behind a bush and whacked you in the knees so that you fell face first into the sand. How does a horse get sand out of his mouth and eyes? He hasn't any hands to wash his face with. Thus, one star.",1285977600,7,1311,4.504201680672269
1024173,4,6305413134,"I enjoy Rutger Hauer and had not seen some of his older movies. If you are a fan, you will like this one!",1265846400,,105,3.608695652173913
1024174,1,6305413134,"I bought this copy, thinking to update my DVD collection of RH. I returned it after 15 minutes of watching. This is not a proper mastered copy, it is also not a silver disc copy but dvd-r. The quality of sound is worse than on any FS releases. The video is terrible disfocused probably recorded in zoom from the tape. Deffinitely not the HD and I was surprised that Amazon sells that.",1215388800,,384,4.347222222222222
1024175,1,6305413134,"I am quite sure that this is the worst action movie I have ever seen. Rutger Hauer is fair in it. Omar Sharif is good in it. Even these quality actors could not save this pantload. The sound was awful, The plot was almost nonexistant and full of more holes than a seive. I am shocked anyone could find this film entertaining. Luckily it has a very nice black plastic case, so it is not a total loss. I put my copy in the trash after I broke it. I would hate to think I had subjected the trashman or anyone else to this kind of vapid, tedious, film",1132358400,3,547,4.027522935779817
1024176,2,6305413134,"A WEALTHY WOMAN [CAROL ALT] SENDS A TOUGH MERCENARY [RUTGER HAUER] TO FIND HER SON. MOVIE TAKES TOO LONG TO GET STARTED AND THE SCRIPT IS FILLED WITH FLAWS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS MOVIE HAS A DECENT CAST, THIS MOVIE FAILS TO BE A GOOD MOVIE. FANS OF RUTGER HAUER DESERVE A BETTER RUTGER HAUER MOVIE THAN THIS FORGETTABLE MOVIE. AT LEAST OMAR SHARIF GIVES A GOOD PERFORMANCE AS AN ARABIAN MAN.",1098489600,5,396,4.438356164383562
1024177,4,6305413134,"The movie Beyond Justice is a great movie for everybody to see. For anybody over the age of 10 should be able to understand the meaning of this video. I have received a sneak preview of the movie from a company that advertises it. If you like comedy , family , action movies with out violence then this is the movie. So buy this movie right away for yourself or a family member it would be a great gift. A AWESOME MOVE !!!",988243200,5,422,4.096385542168675
1024178,4,6305413134,"This movie has been largely ignored by the general public. I suppose this may be partly due to the confusion about the title (it has been released as 'Desert Law', 'Law of the Desert' and 'Beyond Justice'). Nevertheless  Beyond Justice is a fast-paced movie combining spectacular action, good  acting and a plot, that is at least two steps above average for movies in  this genre. The Maltin summary does not do this movie justice. The plot may  have some twists in it, but it avoids the usual loose ends and I see no  reason, why an action movie should have a completely predictable plot. The  actors do a good job (Omar Sharif obviously enjoying himself as a  conservative Arab Sheik and Rutger Hauer quite believable as a  matter-of-fact mercenary) The camera work is downright spectacular, using  the impressive landscape of the Sahara to great effect and the score is one  of the best ever to be heard in action movies. On the whole this is a  forgotten movie, that deserved a far better fate.",950659200,47,998,4.67816091954023

1024292,5,6305413134,"I have seen this movie a couple of times. It is an old movie true however, this kind of thing is STILL HAPPENING when Americans are involved. It shows just what can happen when ones counterpart is a Middle Easterner! They in most cases have the upper hand. So although the movie is old, its plot is still applicable in today's time. This type of action still occurs.",1398816000,2,366,4.397058823529412
1024293,5,6305413134,"If I had to describe this movie in one word, it would be ""OUTSTANDING!"" The scenery, music, acting, and cast are all far above the quality of what emerges from Hollywood today. The variety of weaponry shown is of interest to anyone with an interest in firearms, even if the 'Stinger' is not a perfect replica. The fact that the really evil character meets his fate in the end at the hands of Omar Shariff, using a Jed Clampett-style flintlock, is a nice touch, as well as an earlier humorous reference to Clint Eastwood's timeless quote. Innocent HUMAN BEINGS are KILLED by drunk drivers EVERY DAY, so the loss of ONE horse, in the interest of realism, needs to be kept in perspective. I would have used at least one Rolls Royce in place of the Mercedes cars, but that's a minor point. I stumbled upon this movie by accident originally, as it was on a triple-feature DVD which I bought at a 2nd hand outlet. That's ironic, as it will remain one of the finest movies I've seen in over 50yrs. of films...",1384560000,,1002,4.451086956521739

1024295,4,6305413134,"One of Rutger Hauer's best.  If you area fan, a great addition to your collection.  ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and ""Nighthawks"" were his best, but of a much higher quality film and budget.",1374105600,,184,4.545454545454546
