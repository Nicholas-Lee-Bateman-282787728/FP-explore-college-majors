2126887,2,B0002VK5V6,"Only when I saw this DVD in a Shopko did I remember my old, worn-out VHS tape of Little Lulu I loved as a child.  This DVD includes the only 8 episodes I am familiar with:

Chick and Double Chick
Bargain Counterattack
A Bout With a Trout
Loose in a Caboose
Bored of Education
A Scout With the Gout
Musical Lulu
The Dog Show Off

The cartoons are great but the DVD will leave you wanting.  Absolutely no extras and it comes in a paper sleeve.  The picture and sound quality are not DVD quality.  But if you are a Lulu fan, it's worth it to have these episodes at such a cheap price.  I give it a two because the disc has nothing save the cartoons, but they're still great!",1100304000,12,671,4.076335877862595

8033220,5,B0002VK5V6,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Little Lulu 8 Full Length Episodes.  It brought back many wonderful childhood memories watching Little Lulu.  I appreciate the older cartoons versus today's more modern cartoons.  The older cartoons were much more creative, less aggressive and friendlier towards children.  Good and evil and the idea of a conscience was stressed versus the ambiguity of morals in today's cartoons.
Newer cartoons seem to strip away the innocence of what a child should see and experience...they are too complicated, rigid and often times have elements of violence that assault a child's senses.  Today's cartoons do not enhance a child's imagination, but smother it in adult oriented themes.  Give me Little Lulu any day of the week! Kudos to the animators of yesterday's cartoons.",1246060800,5,790,5.28
8033221,4,B0002VK5V6,"This a collection of eight Little Lulu cartoon movies.  One has a scene where Lulu is spiritually pulled in opposite directions by an angel and a devil on her shoulders.  The angel was very good, and the devil was very bad.  Both look much like Lulu herself.  This was a simple but effective dramatization.  It is too bad that people now see it as too unsophisticated to be taken seriously.",1171584000,,390,4.514285714285714
