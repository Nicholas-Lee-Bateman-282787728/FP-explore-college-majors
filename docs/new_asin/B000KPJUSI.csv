8158561,3,B000KPJUSI,"The primary message you might take away from this film is that if you want to suffer for your art, take up the dying art of pansori - a traditional Korean performance art with a singer wailing a story for up to several hours, accompanied by a lone drummer.

The film follows an intinerant pansori singer criss-crossing the Korean country (usually in wet and miserable conditions), making a meager living for himself and his two ""children"" -- a girl and boy who he is training in pansori. It's in the aftermath of World War II, however, and change is sweeping the country.

More than the story, more than the good actors or the Korean countryside, pansori is the true star of this film. Several pansori fragments -- some short, some long -- are performed over the course of the movie which might serve to acclimate the western viewer. Pansori seems to be the equivalent of western opera -- the voices are trained to a high degree, resulting in a voice that is extremely pure and resonant. The pansori singer, however, is more expressive and uses many vocal tricks to convey emotion. To my ear, the singer seems to be wailing.

The story itself is harsh and honest and simple. To me, it didn't get started til about the second half when the story turns into a quest.

This movie was an unexpected hit upon its release in 1993 -- despite being released on only a few screens -- perhaps cuz it awakened the sense of being Korean thru the plight of this uniquely Korean tradition.
