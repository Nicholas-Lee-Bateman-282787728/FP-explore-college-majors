6069929,5,B00GBHR0GI,"What can I say about this series?
Is it good? No. Is it great? Not even close.

It's PURE gold. AnoHana is truly an amazing series. There's just no way around it. It does in 11 episodes what other series can't do in 40, it leaves a mark (Perhaps even a scar). It just gives you these feelings of nostalgia that you don't even have.
Whenever I listen to the songs my heart hurts a little. The character are portrayed in a way that you get to empathize and understand everyone (no matter how much of a prick they used to look like).

The story might not seem like it's anything truly new at the beginning, but the way the whole series plays out is something else, the animation is beautiful, the voice acting is flawless, (sadly there's no dub, but it doesn't need one anyway) and the music is simply memorable.
Also Masayoshi Tanaka is the character designer, he also designed the characters for Toradora! (one on my favorite animes right next to AnoHana, YEAH, I SAID IT!!)  and Waiting in the summer two anime series with amazing character animations. Needless to say when the movie adaptation (it's a retelling of the story through Menma's point of view, with additional scenes) comes out I'll be buying it.",1384387200,24,1209,4.536697247706422
6069930,5,B00GBHR0GI,"One of the best anime I have watched in a very long time.  Touching and wonderful are not enough to describe it.  Character development is wonderful and they are almost all very enjoyable characters.  If you're looking for a happy, care-free anime to watch, this is the one.",1413244800,,274,4.666666666666667
6069931,5,B00GBHR0GI,"I've never cried so much for an anime, let alone a television series. This is one amazing anime that I've stumbled upon by chance and I am so glad I did. This show feels so complete and fulfilled in its 11 episodes. I highly recommend watching it (if you can't afford it, watch it on Crunchyroll). I've watched a lot of anime and this one is up there with Silver Spoon as a heartwarmingly tear jerker.",1407628800,,401,4.2894736842105265
6069932,5,B00GBHR0GI,"Good box, fantastic show.",1404345600,,25,5.5
6069933,5,B00GBHR0GI,"I can not say enough about Anohana and how touching, and wonderful it is! Be prepared to cry, A LOT! You will laugh some, but you get so endeared to the characters you feel what each one of them feel. So no spoilers, but if you want to feel good and have a good cry fest watch Anohana!!",1402531200,,286,3.9482758620689653
6069934,4,B00GBHR0GI,"There's not much new in this series that you probably haven't seen before if you're a fan of anime, but don't let that stop you from seeing Ano Hana. The mix of tragedy and reconciliation has been measured carefully and artfully for maximum effect that will not disappoint. It's not quite on the same level as legends like Clannad but it's still worth watching. Be warned that this series was not meant for binge watching. Every episode lays on the emotions rather thick and get a bit much if you try to watch more than one a day, in my opinion.",1397347200,6,545,4.405940594059406
6069935,5,B00GBHR0GI,Amazing series & the packaging was very well done. This is definitely a must buy if you've seen it & love Anime. It's been forever for this series to be out for standard purchase & it finally comes out in combo; Blu ray & DVD.,1396224000,,226,4.044444444444444

6069937,5,B00GBHR0GI,"I first found and watched AnoHana over the internet, as soon as I started watching I couldn't stop. The story was amazing with so much character growth, I convinced a bunch a friends to watch it as well had to withhold the fact that it causes mansobs but they also liked it. AnoHana is a really touching anime that everyone should see, its neither childish nor a big joke it really brings to light the kind of effect afriends death can have on kids. Anyone who hasn't seen it should not over look it.",1391212800,,500,4.329787234042553
6069938,5,B00GBHR0GI,"AnoHana: The Flower We Saw That Day is a eleven episode series focusing around six childhood friends called the Peace Busters. However, when one of the members Menma tragically died the group fell apart. The show generally focuses on the former leader of the group Jintan Yadomi and how he must fulfill the wish of the ghost of Menma to make sure she goes into heaven.

On paper the plot doesn't seem like anything that would set the world on fire and it's true. It isn't anything spectacularly new. Already done in several movies and TV shows such as the movie ""Ghost"" and TV show ""Dead Like Me"".  However, the show is smart enough to treat it's subject matter delicately. The anime doesn't focus heavily on the supernatural aspect of life and death but instead keeps its drama to the core of its main characters dynamics. It was a wise move not to spread supernatural elements along such a short series. The characters all act realistically and have a strong group dynamic. Each playing off each other well with character flaws that make them human and not unlikable.

The show does move at a slow pace. Keeping it's audience entertained with plenty of slice of life humor. However, the deliberate pace strengthens the narrative allowing the audience to really understand and if not sympathize at least understand the characters. Even making the use of plenty of anime cliches such as love triangles work within its narrative. The show has plenty of  emotional moments and while in a lesser work these might tug a bit at your heart and you wouldn't remember them AnoHana makes them work.

The show also has a great ending. It wraps up everything it needs to.  I would recommend this anime to anyone trying to break into the genre and for any fans in general. The show should be praised and  recommended right up there with Naruto, One Piece, Elfen Lied etc. Easily worth a watch.",1389225600,7,1881,4.681818181818182
6069939,5,B00GBHR0GI,"Anohana is mainly a story about Jinta Yadomi a boy with a tragic past. To avoid spoilers I won't tell you about what happened. One day a group of friends called the super peace busters are torn apart by a tragic event. Years later the leader Jinta has become a neet (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Till one day his friend Menma shows up and through her he and the other members of the super peace busters slowly come to terms with those tragic events. Each member in their own way is broken Jinta is just the most obvious. The episodes bring out all the tangled emotions and pain each member is still going through and the guilt they all feel from that day. At it's core Anohana is not a love story but a story about love. The ending scenes are some of the most tear inducing scenes I have ever watched. This anime is more of a drama though it does have it's comedic moments.
If you enjoy animes like Clannad, Air TV, and Myself Yourself then this is a must see. I first watched this anime at Crunchyroll and just had to have it.",1389139200,3,1042,4.267676767676767

8621993,5,B00GBHR0GI,"Anime is hit or miss with me, usually miss. AnoHana (aka Cho Hiewa Busters) is different. A 5 star anime, more of a 4 star story though, which is loads better than most movies out there, anime or other. Why is this not available on Amazon?! When I think of all the other junk Amazon sells. . .I really need to find a new online shopping site, one that actually carries decent films.",1424736000,,382,4.2465753424657535
