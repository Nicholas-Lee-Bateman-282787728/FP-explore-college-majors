3098718,4,B0012S9BLI,Jacob's DVD is a good introduction to gentle yoga for those with minor physical issues preventing one from doing a more strenuous Yoga practice.  Students are encouraged to perform the poses as introduced with options provided for variations if one has physical limitations. The video is a helpful alternative and supplement to attending a formal yoga class and is an excellent guide to gentle stretching and relaxation in the home setting.,1358380800,,440,5.197183098591549
3098719,5,B0012S9BLI,"After my first class with Jacob, I had tears in my eyes.  I had never taken the time to listen to my body and spend time treating it with such care.  I knew after one class with him that I needed to continue the practice of Yoga to better my mind and spirit.  Yoga is a healer, and Jacob is a wonderful teacher.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone!",1358035200,,350,3.9571428571428573
3098720,4,B0012S9BLI,"First, I will list the only reason this received 4 stars instead of 5.  The cover shows the teacher with a student.  However, this dvd is performed by Yogi Jacob ONLY.  There is no class and he is somewhat boring to listen to.  Other than that, the dvd does deliver.  His instructions are clear and gentle indeed.  I think this would be great for people over 55.  I enjoyed it except for the fact that I thought he would be adjusting students as per the cover of the dvd.  I would recommend this to others.",1327276800,,506,4.252631578947368

8247631,5,B0012S9BLI,"I not only have Jacob's DVD, I have also been taking his class 3-4 times a week for 5-6 years.  His routine helped me mentally and physically overcome an injury.  I highly recommend his DVD to anyone who wants to improve mind, body and soul.",1410652800,,241,4.333333333333333

8247633,5,B0012S9BLI,"Excellent class for beginners or those who have been away from yoga for awhile, or for those who have stiff, uncooperative joints, arthritus pain, etc.  Although it is gentle, it is thorough and we move through all positions and motions.  Highly Recommend it.  JC",1410393600,,263,4.931818181818182
8247634,5,B0012S9BLI,"My husband and I take Jacob's Gentle Yoga classes and are so delighted with his teachings and knowledge.  The routine stretches and utilizes every part of the body in a stress-free, relaxing manner that still gives great benefits.  We like how each student is encouraged to listen to their own body and do the modifications or not as needed.  When we can't get to class, the DVD helps remind us of what comes next.  I just wish we had started Gentle Yoga with Jacob when we were younger.  I can't imagine not doing Gentle Yoga as my body ages.  I was a gymnast when younger so my body took some beating, so it feels really healthy to take such good care of it now.  My goal is to still be doing handstands into my 80's and 90's!",1386633600,,728,4.2700729927007295
8247635,5,B0012S9BLI,"After 4 years of taking classes with Jacob I am hooked.  I could not be happier - nor healthier.  At 81 I look forward to at least 4 more years.

8247636,5,B0012S9BLI,Jacob's instruction has been very beneficial by increasing/maintaining my range of motion and flexibility. I took up his instruction at the age of 68 but highly recommend it for all ages.,1371513600,,187,5.064516129032258
8247637,5,B0012S9BLI,I have been attending Jacob's Gentle Yoga class for years.  He is a great teacher and I love the stretches and his routine....it has significantly increased my flexibility....don't know where I would be if I had not had this opportunity.  The DVD very closely covers what we do in class.  I highly recommend it and personally do not think you can go wrong on this DVD.,1359676800,,368,4.545454545454546
