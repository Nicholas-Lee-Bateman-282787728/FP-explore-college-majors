8684693,5,B00OSC8UEO,"same fun as the other Peter Rabbit dvds.  My grandson (2) loves them all.  We rotate watching them when he comes over so it's not always the same one but he's beginning to know all the stories.  He really enjoys these and that's the first thing he does when we arrive at my house, jump on the divan and tries to sing the Peter Rabbit tune while pointing to the tv.  Very nice for little kids, not so crazy noisy as cartoons.  Good wholesome fun and cute stories with charming characters.",1478736000,,487,4.3076923076923075
