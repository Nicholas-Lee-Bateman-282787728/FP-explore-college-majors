4600769,5,B0058MX99Y,I've been enjoying this series for about a month now.  It's typical Jamie Oliver and the production quality of the series is fantastic!  The series is really inspiring and educational,1356134400,,183,5.066666666666666

4600771,5,B0058MX99Y,"I received this DVD set as a gift, and I must say that they are probably some of the most watched DVDs that I own.  Jamie is passionate about the food he cooks, and it really shows.  His approach to creating a dish isn't rigid, but lends well to adding your own flair to it. I would HIGHLY recommend this set to anyone interested in food!!",1349827200,,339,4.121212121212121
4600772,4,B0058MX99Y,"I have been following Jamie Oliver since his first series ""The Naked Chef"". Usually when I watch his shows, they make me want to cook. This series makes me want to travel. Though there is some cooking in each episode, there is also a lot of discovering the local scenery and culture. For example, in Andalucia, he goes to bullfighter school. In Morocco, he explores the markets, pastry shops, and spice vendors of Marrakesh with snake charmers and cobras in the background.

Where he does cook, he seeks to incorporate the culinary traditions of the place he is visiting. In Spain, he makes paella for 500 people in an enormous pan over hot coals near the village square. In Morocco he cooks lamb stew in a clay pot in the wood fired oven of the baths. In France, he joins hunts for truffles and for wild boar. In Sweden he tries canned herring which has been allowed to ferment well beyond its ""use by"" date before opening.

His earlier shows focused on showing how to prepare uncomplicated and tasty dishes at home with ordinary ingredients. Here we find truffles and quails eggs and freshly killed wild rabbit. We see huge crusty loaves of sourdough bread being baked in a wood fired oven and Jamie being initiated into an ancient society of bakers, though he doesn't make any bread himself and no bread recipe is provided. He does makes duck confit with a key ingredient being a big jar of duck fat.

If you have the slightest interest in exploring the world and in discovering the culinary traditions of foreign lands, these beautifully photographed shows are a visual pleasure. You'll see some of the sights and be introduced to some of the dishes which are specialties of each place. However, you shouldn't expect that you'll find here recipes and techniques for making all the things he shows you or even that you'll see a lot of dishes you'll make at home afterwards. Unless of course in your house you plan to cook up truffles and quails eggs and wild boar, and your local megamart stocks big jars of duck fat in the gourmet section.",1343692800,7,2043,4.622589531680441
4600773,5,B0058MX99Y,Purchased this DVD set on Amazon for my husband this Christmas and they are a huge hit. He is really enjoying them. My husband is a chef and our family loves Jamie Oliver-- perfect addition to our J.O. cookbooks.,1325203200,4,212,4.461538461538462

4600797,5,B0058MX99Y,"For a real food expert, from proper authentic ingredients, to how food should fit in life, to exciting presentation, no one is better than Jamie Oliver. He is someone to buy into for one's food philosophy. This set of videos is great not only for the items he cooks, but within the context of where the dishes originate.  The credits are a bit corny, but the rest is just terrific.",1381881600,,381,4.442857142857143

8461878,5,B0058MX99Y,"I love this series. We started with the French Pyrenees online and then ended up buying all of the episodes. This series is really a look into what makes each city/area special, including the people and lifestyle. Food is such an important reflection of culture and geography, and Jamie really highlights the unique and special ingredients and cooking styles from each region. But he also talks to people, takes us to the markets in the different areas, takes us fishing and farming, etc. I feel like it is almost a travel show, but with a story that is told through food.",1402358400,2,572,4.673267326732673
