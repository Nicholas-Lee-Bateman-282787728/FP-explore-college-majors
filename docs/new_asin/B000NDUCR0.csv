Note: to get fight commentary you must enable it as the second audio track. Otherwise you'll just get crowd and fight sounds, which gets a bit tedious.

In my opinion, the extras are a mixed bag. The behind the scenes footage is very interesting, but gets marred by hyper-editing and random animation. It's amusing, but I'd rather hear what the fighters are talking about and straight interviews. There are two straight animations that are advertised that way and are funny, but I felt that the mixed ones were unneeded.",1231459200,,1419,4.662650602409639

Fights: Couture vs. Inoue, Shamrock vs. Inoue, Trigg vs. Machado, Paulson vs. Newton, Henderson vs. De Souza, Sato vs. Lewis, Pederneiras vs. Sato

Each fight is followed up by the highlights.

The bonus features is what makes this one so classic. I don't know who came up with these sick twisted Monty-Python-like animation shorts but they had me laughing. Tom Erickson with cat ears, Frank Trigg with butterfly wings, Enson Inoue's face on a statue of Buddha!",1215993600,,647,4.91743119266055
8177465,5,B000NDUCR0,"This is the best MMA fight compilation DVD ever! I am the consummate MMA fan and I had never even seen most of the fights in this DVD. Frank Trigg vs. Jean Jacques Machado is one of the all-time classics. The footage of Tom Ericksen and Kevin Randleman is amazing as well. I can't say enough about this DVD: Randy Couture, Frank Shamrock, Enson Inoue, Dan Henderson, Carlos Newton... enough said.",1211500800,,396,4.591549295774648
