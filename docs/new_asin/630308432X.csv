555839,5,630308432X,"This is the real documentary of one platoon during the Vietnam War. The group is lead by a young African American, Joe Anderson. This film documents what is was like for these young men fighting in Vietnam and the  effect it had on them. The film won an Academy Award. It's a must see!",933724800,6,285,4.277777777777778

7836891,4,630308432X,"New York University hosted a screening of The Anderson Platoon, the Oscar-winning documentary on a Vietnam War United States Army unit led by Lt. Joseph B. Anderson, Jr., followed by a discussion featuring Anderson and NYU historians Marilyn Young and Jeffrey Sammons, on Mon., Feb. 23, 2015. The event was sponsored by: NYUs Department of History; the universitys Office of Student Affairs; Polytechnic Institute of NYU; the Veteran Resource Center at NYUs School of Professional Studies; NYUs Institute of African American Affairs; and NYU Milvets, part of the NYU Student Resource Center.

 ... WELCOME HOME, LT ANDERSON! would have loved to have been there to shake your had, sir. Now, this is NOT the version I remember seeing almost forty years ago, because the music is different. I remember the Nancy Sinatra ""BOOTS"" song quite clearly; Kubrick, 20 years later would use it in his FULL METAL JACKET soundtrack. NEVERTHELESS this is a powerful film, comparable to A FACE OF WAR (hard to find except on YouTube!) in its ability to TRIGGER. So, if, like me, you suffer from PTSD, TAKE HEED and watch with care - or with a careGIVER. Study the wonderful young faces of these warriors and see yourself in their eyes. Some do not make it home alive. The music is okay, and Stuart Whitman is no Orson Welles; get it for your local Veterans center for their film and video library, if nothing else, as I have done. My personal rating: ""R"" for war violence, language, and suspense. The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences gave this film the OSCAR for best documentary in 1967.",1427760000,,1583,4.837638376383764
7836892,5,630308432X,I enjoyed this movie made by a former French soldier who had fought in South East Asia himself. I think its the best documentary made during the war about soldiers. It doesn't glitz things up. It shows how soldiering is really long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of stark terror.,1382659200,,289,4.686274509803922
7836893,5,630308432X,"I was wondering [while viewing this remarkable film] why I never saw it as a kid during Vietnam on the U.S. media. I realized why it was buried in the American press soon enough. It showed Americans helping sick women, children and wounded enemy personnel --- while being shot to pieces.",1105315200,13,287,4.647058823529412
7836894,5,630308432X,"The original version By Pierre Schoendoerffer,is an Excellent film, A MUST see for any military historian.

BUT BEWARE!!!!! there is a 1987 remake of this film that has the same title ands uses rearanged original footage from the film, This butchery is the WORST thing to happen to ""Anderson Platoon"" Try to make sure you are buying the original!!!! Huge difference!!! The edititng in the 1987 verson looks like a high school AV room, and the broken naration is so vauge, you have no clue what is going on, (unless you had seen the original already)

It was VERY frustraiting to watch this film, Id give The original 5 stars, and the remake 1 star.

7836895,5,630308432X,"Going through some reviews, I understand what their disappointment might be. This is not a documentary produced by Hollywood or by a major movie Cy. This is the result of 6 weeks shooting, on the field, with the troop, in the very conditions the soldiers lived then and there, a completely accurate picture of what their lifes really were. Some point out the low camera angle in some parts, but I guess the cameraman couldn't simply stand up and record whereas the Vietcong were shooting at them ! Risk was there and the movie team (three people) could be killed every moment...Just to show what the soldier's life is. Not more, not less. The american awards it received are simply telling how people liked it then, in 1966. This documentary is simply human. A must see.",1051228800,19,770,4.669117647058823
7836896,5,630308432X,"Indeed, as a ""This is what the entire Vietnam Intervention was like in its entirety"" documentary, this falls far short.  However, remove the ""entirety"" part, (which was probably never the goal, anyway) and ""The Anderson Platoon"" is revealed to be a brilliantly straightforward and nonjudgemental microscopic view of ""a pawn in a much larger game.""  If one is beginning a collection of Vietnam Intervention nonfiction, don't start here; still, make sure to include this before the finish.",1035849600,7,487,5.311688311688312
7836897,2,630308432X,"Although it was somewhat interesting seeing actual footage of an infantry platoon, I was very dissapointed with this film.  It was far to short, however it seemed to drag on endlessly.  There is only one action scene in the documentary at the very end, which is it's highpoint...as low as it was.  I found it quite pointless to film a platoon in vietnam and then say, this person died two weeks from now...this person died four days from now...""  I know that people died in vietnam, unfortunately, I still don't know how they fought.",1010275200,,533,4.638297872340425
7836898,1,630308432X,"I ordered this video based on the overwhelmingly high marks other viewers gave, but I cannot concur. Although some of the action scenes were enough to evoke strong emotion, overall the video is replete with irrelevant scenes like the ankle-level footage of the soldier's footsteps; bad music and nearly indecipherable narration. English subtitles would be a plus. I can't decide whether the high point was the soldier buying his ""girlfriend"" a guitar while on R&R, or the urination scene.",1007078400,5,488,5.189873417721519
7836899,5,630308432X,"Good documentary of a combat platoon in Vietnam. This isn't an action movie. The director/narrator has a heavy french accent and you find yourself rewinding the tape at certain points. The film is in black and white with a few shots that get kind of blurry. If you are not familiar with times,places and certain battles of the Vietnam war you could find yourself getting confused. This is a movie for someone that is very interested in the Vietnam war i wouldn't recommend it to someone that is used to seeing hollywood on the front lines because you will be disapointed.  I thought this was one of the better films showing war to someone who has never experienced it first hand. Well worth the price tag and if I were you I would get express shipping on this one.",981072000,13,764,4.496402877697841
