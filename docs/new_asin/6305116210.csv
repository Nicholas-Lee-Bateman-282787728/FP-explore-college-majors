7883579,5,6305116210,Thanks for sending my DVDs so quickly.  Im waiting to give them to my husband for his birthday this Friday!  We both watched this show as kids growing up.  He will love this gift.  Many thanks!,1511222400,,193,4.277777777777778
7883580,5,6305116210,"Usually you look back at old programs like the Lone Ranger and think how hokey they were. Then you realize that you, being a kid at the time could enjoy them as they were. Then there is ""Topper"" the TV show. It was one big smoking commercial. Well I sort of counted on this happening with ""My Little Margie."" Boy was I surprised. The plots are complex for the small period of time they have to execute in. Hokey or not they had me laughing. And Price per pound, you get twelve episodes. I am working my way through for a second time. When I get tired, I will put them on the shelf and they look good in the box set.",1500940800,6,615,4.049180327868853
7883581,4,6305116210,and still do.  Would love a complete set of same.  Basically it was the I Love Lucy Show with Father/Daughter instead of Husband/Wife with the addition of a pathetic boyfriend for Margie,1342915200,5,186,4.78125
7883582,5,6305116210,"PERHAPS I AM PREDJUDICE BUT ""MY LITTLE MARGIE"" WAS MY FAVORITE WHEN I WAS YOUNG.  FOR THIS REASON I CAN HONESTLY SAY I WAS IN NO WAY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS COLLECTION.

7883583,4,6305116210,"Despite the obvious limitations of any early '50s sitcom - i.e. stilted performances, subordinate roles for women, etc. - this show was more than progressive for the time. ""Margie"" was actually a highly intelligent, independent character, who accomplished her goals without the abusive lecturing you find in today's comedy shows - if the show were made today, she would spend half the show shouting at ""Vern"". The show was very well written and directed, using physical humour when needed. In that area, Charles Farrell is surely one of the most under-appreciated actors. He was taking pratfalls in a three piece suit years before Steve Martin!
Perhaps one of the reasons that the comedy was so well-balanced was that it was produced by Hal Roach, Jr., the son of the great producer of Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase, and so many other classics. It definitely has the Roach touch.",1003536000,3,881,4.95945945945946
7883584,5,6305116210,"I really love old classic TV, like Lucy, I Married Joan, Father Knows Best and Margie.  I'm a big Margie fan, so I've got other episodes.  This set represents the best of the series.  These are some of the most hilarious  and entertaining episodes in the series.  Whoever put these sets together,  chose the very best of the episodes, for sure.  If you want to be  entertained and you love oldie TV, you can't go wrong with this set.",960508800,17,433,4.3924050632911396
7883585,5,6305116210,Gale Storm is perhaps best known for her portrayal of Margie Albright in this hilarious comedy. It is genuinely funny and endearing.,947548800,2,132,5.045454545454546
