8316158,5,B001KVCUYM,"I bought this to bond more with my rabbit,
Not only was it full of details of how to massage, it described a great deal of anatomy, physiology, and psychology to a new rabbit owner.  The author is well informed, and is an excellent teacher for the novice/ intermediate rabbit owner.  Thank you for a wonderful video and your service to our Lagomorph Loves.",1373760000,,356,4.546875
8316159,4,B001KVCUYM,"This video has a lot of great information and food for thought. The slow, repeated chapter intros are probably unnecessary, but overall the DVD is a unique, helpful resource.",1366848000,,174,5.0344827586206895

8316161,5,B001KVCUYM,"I have a rabbit who was passed down through multiple owners, and handled by countless numbers of people, before she finally ended up at my house. When I got her, she was a nipper and a lunger. I got this DVD to help her learn to trust me and to strengthen our bonds.

This DVD is fantastic! I admit I felt a little silly buying a DVD about rabbit massage, but I figured the worst that could happen is that she wasn't into it and at least it wouldn't harm either one of us. Well, I watched the whole DVD (it's 70 minutes), and it was full of anatomical and medical information about rabbits. In addition to giving specific massage techniques, it talks about how to know when your bunny is enjoying the massage and when she isn't. Ms. Beal emphasizes, in her gentle way, that the rabbit must always be in charge. Armed with this new information, I set about massaging my bunny. I started very slow, approaching her gently and talking in a low voice, and keeping the sessions quite short. I always left her wanting more. Now she ""begs"" me for massages! I can see the effect the work has on her as she turns into a puddle of relaxed fur. It's relaxing for me as well. We're much closer now.

What's more, my 7-year-old son loves the video! He enjoys watching the author/narrator's black-and-white bunny get massaged into a lagomorphic trance by Ms. Beal's gentle ministrations. I'm always admonishing him to be gentle with our bun, but I think this video has made my case better than I ever could have. After learning more about these mysterious creatures and their need for security, he's much gentler around our rabbit now.

If you own a bunny, please consider this DVD. It's a huge investment in your relationship with your pet. Ms Beal outlines all the benefits of massage, and there are many, but nothing can beat this -- it just feels great for both of you.

I don't own it, and this video is very comprehensive so I don't think the book is necessary as a companion piece.)",1356480000,,2151,4.758713136729223
8316162,5,B001KVCUYM,"I thought this product was really good. Massages are good for humans, why wouldn't they be good for pets too? It may take a while for your rabbit to calm down enough and let you touch them everywhere you need to, but it is so worth it. My rabbit melts when I start massaging him. Highly recommended. Definitely worth the price.",1342828800,,327,4.377049180327869
8316163,5,B001KVCUYM,"My rabbit Emma was a rescue bun having been found in the street and taken to a shelter.

Emma has always been very skittish and nervous. I'm sure this is not helped by the fact that she is also about 90% deaf and blind in one eye. Combine all that and you end up with a bun who's very difficult to get near too.

I bought and watched the relaxed rabbit DVD after a friend recommended it.

The production values are very high, the techniques well explained and easier to follow than any book could be, as Chandra works on a real rabbit throughout the video. The rabbit Gilligan used throughout the video is super cute and although I've not managed to get Emma to relax quite as much as him, it certainly has made a world of difference to how I interact with Emma.

Before I got this video and worked with Emma I had basically resigned myself to the fact that she was never going to be physically close and more of a bun that lived in my house. I was ok with that but would have loved more. Having worked with Emma for over a year on the techniques from the video and our relationship is transformed. These days Emma jumps up on the couch, lies next to me while I'm watching TV, follows me around the house and is generally the very model of an affectionate pet.

I'd honestly give this 6 stars if Amazon would let me. This has changed a distant relationship into a very close bond. Don't waste money on toys that your bun will never play with, spend it on this DVD and you'll have a completely new loving relationship in your life. At least that's my experience.",1309046400,4,1561,4.260135135135135
