6582946,5,B00MIA0KM8,No issues with the DVD. Always nice to watch a simpler time in television. Quincy was and is very enjoyable for me. Funny how all of the Quincy equivalent shows now involve a lot of sex appeal to get the viewers through an episode. Quincy was purely story based. A little slow but very enjoyable. Highly recommend.,1419120000,4,314,4.526315789473684

6582948,5,B00MIA0KM8,"Some of the episodes were familiar (like the ones about Down's syndrome or the one about the gun).  For others, I have no memory whatsoever about them, like the lady with PTSD from the Vietnam war.  Keep 'em coming!  I episode of Quincy per day is better than watching any of the TV shows made in 2014!",1418256000,7,302,4.2631578947368425

6582955,5,B00MIA0KM8,"I was real happy to see the continuation of the release of this series. I saw an article which showed a letter that a fan had received from Shout which said that they have also put the last release on their schedule for early 2015. It is a fun show to watch with a great cast. The price is good for a new release, but I usually wait a while because I have noticed that they usually go down to about $25 after a while. What a deal!
Edit to add-I just purchased because it released today for $29.99.",1412380800,15,497,4.03030303030303

6582958,4,B00MIA0KM8,"This 1982-83 Season was Quincy's final season after 7 exciting and exhausting year run on NBC and was like a cross between MURDER SHE WROTE, and CSI.
Jack Klugman returns as the City of Angels most brilliant and uncompromising medical examiner in this final season of the hit series Quincy, M.E.
Investigating suspicious deaths for the Los Angeles County Coroners Office, the strong-willed Quincy frequently confronted some of the eras toughest social issues. Season Sevens twenty-four episodes (originally airing on NBCs 1981-82 television season) find the intrepid doctor taking on cases involving fraternity hazing, toxic waste, gun control, milk and drunk driving.

Frequently cited as an influence on todays successful crime investigation dramas, Quincy, M.E.'s 1982-83 Season also features guest appearances by Mimi Rogers, Tyne Daly, Terrance Tendercoin, Jonathan Frakes and Dixie Carter.

Additionally, you can watch this medical drama without all those butchered scenes you'd get on in reruns on A&E, Me-TV, and now Cozi-TV.",1476316800,,1033,5.615384615384615

8672552,4,B00MIA0KM8,"Welcome to QUINCY, M.E., one of the most enjoyable and influential television shows in the history of television. This is the story of Dr. Quincy -- no first name ever given! -- a crusty, hot-tempered, do-gooding Los Angeles County medical examiner (Jack Klugman) who uses forensic science to unravel mysteries which leave his cop friends Lieutenant Monohan (Garry Walberg) and Sergeant Brill (Joe Roman), and his paper-pushing fop of a boss, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) scratching their respective heads. Of course when Quincy is not solving murder mysteries he is taking up a lance for every public-spirited cause you can possibly think of, from child abuse to teenage drug use to illegal immigration to punk rock music and beyond. Can't fight City Hall? Quincy treats City Hall like a rock-'em-sock-'em robot!

Of course, in so doing, he aggravates absolutely everyone, from murderers, who try to kill him, to big corporations, who try to muzzle him, to his girlfriends (he has thousands), who try to leave him, to his long-suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito) and best friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio) who just try to put up with him. Half the fun of QUINCY is seeing the enraged or baffled expressions of everyone who crosses his path. Imagine a fiery liberal muckraker with a medical degree and a nose (a BIG nose) for mysteries and a taste for the ladies, and you've got this show in a nutshell.

It's true that QUINCY's seventh season takes its sweet time getting going, but when it does, all systems are go and we get all the classic things we expect from this show -- ""causes,"" Quincy fighting with everyone, the usual horseplay between Q. his frenemies. Here are some of the more memorable episodes:

The Golden Hour - Quincy investigates (as only Quincy can) why a girl with minor injuries from a car wreck died at one hospital, while her father, who was severely hurt, managed to survive at another.

D.U.I - A ""routine"" D.U.I. fatality case turns tricky when Quincy begins to suspect the guilty party is guilty of much more than accidental homicide.

Dead Stop - Quincy races against time to find out where truckers have been dumping huge loads of toxic waste.

Bitter Pill - One of the season's best puts Quincy against the ""lookalike"" drug industry.

Guns Don't Die - A unique POV story which follows the trail of havoc left by a single ""Saturday night special"" handgun.

Smoke Screen - Quincy tangles with a pyromaniac who may -- or may not -- have been responsible for a hotel fire that killed a dozen people.

Into the Murdering Mind - A young man with murderous habits exploits loopholes in the legal system to ply his deadly trade. Probably the closest episode QUINCY ever produced to a pure ""horror"" episode.

To Clear the Air - After several people with pre-existing lung conditions drop dead during a smog alert, Quincy goes to war with a local plant which is spewing illegal pollution.

As I said before, the penultimate season of QUINCY takes a bit of a while to kick into gear, but in the end it delivers the goods. What this show was really about, between the ""causes"" and the standard mystery stories, was simply pointing Jack Klugman at the camera and letting him rip.",1511740800,,3205,4.756756756756757
8672553,5,B00MIA0KM8,Best t.v. series ever put on television.  Most have a social issue plot which makes them so endearing.  Jack Klugman is great in the role of Quincy with a cast of regulars which make the program a must to watch.  Excellent quality!,1509753600,,231,4.4523809523809526
