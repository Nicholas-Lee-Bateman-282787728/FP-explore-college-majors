8344725,5,B001URA5QG,"This picks up with the story of Ahab and Elijah. Prof. Vanderlaan gives some in-depth background on the nature of the cults of Baal and Ashtaroth at the time. (Be advised, the Baal and Ashtaroth worship entailed explicit sexual practices and child sacrifices. This material should only be viewed by children if thier parents believe they have the maturity level). While the Baal and Ashtaroth cults were stomach-turning in barbarity, but what is truly sobering are the underlying parallels in modern society.
You will definitely have your eyes opened to WHY Yaweh was so insistent regarding holiness, and the punishment for the Israelites prolonged worship of Baal was so complete and brutal.
Truly, a mind-blowing Bible study!",1402272000,2,727,5.222222222222222
