992336,5,6305226172,"THE NAKED CITY is New York: a metropolis of playgrounds and police precincts, fire escapes and brownstones, neon lights, subways rushing during rush-hour & fire hydrants sprinkling the streets on a sweltering summer day.  Definitely not a city constructed on a Hollywood back lot: this film benefits immensely from location shooting. The film is a series of powerful scenes, first depicting the murder of a pretty, man-hungry larcenous young model, and then detailing the efforts of the cops to sniff out her killers. Eventually, they unravel the case culminating with a thrilling chase sequence across the Williamsburg Bridge from Manhattan's Lower East Side into Brooklyn.  The fact that big-name star weren't cast in the film add to its appeal: this curiousty adds to the realism of this film.  Highly innovative for 1948 was the cinematography technique used: the camera crew worked from inside a van equipped with a one-way mirror which enabled them to film the city while remaining invisible to the passerby: this technique has inspired scores of films since.",1043625600,8,1065,5.216374269005848
992337,5,6305226172,"The naked City plays out like no other film noir eve made. Unlike other noir's that explore a vast landscape the Naked City turns NYC into a fully fleshed out character. In this vision NYC is the home of run rampant jewel thieves, beautiful women and wisdom filled cops. But it's the overwhelming sense of reality adn open ended didalogue that blasts this gem off the screen. Unlike many Noir's Naked City has no problem placing the action in the day light which is glorius. Taking the gloss and sheen off the actor's faces and replacing it with sweat and urgency as they chase criminals; over the years this technique became standard. THe film begins with a shocking image of two men corvorting over a woman's dead limp body only to take off in numerous plot twists and turns as a winding road. To follow film noir is to love it the reverse of good and evil with extended laps in judgement and violence with in the world of irony. The naked City is a prime example of brilliant film making; a precise plot, elegant cinematography and brilliant acting and casting. This film is a little seen gem that has to be viewed now!",1015200000,10,1122,4.504901960784314
992338,5,6305226172,"The recurring question asked by the police detectives showing the photo of a boxer as they engage in the massive manhunt for the murderer of a young Manhattanite woman. This is one of the seminal film noir pieces, showing the seamy side of NYC as the police, headed by Barry Fitzgerald, try to figure out just why Jean Dexter was found in her bathtub, but not as a drowning victim. We go deeper and deeper into the morass of immorality among some city denizens--Jean doesn't seem like a very nice girl, but someone has to be brought to justice for her death, even if it means the chase leads to the top of the Williamsburg Bridge itself. Filmed on gritty location in NYC just after WW2, ""The Naked City"" still delivers after 50 years. Make it a point to check it out.",995414400,5,767,4.408450704225352
992339,5,6305226172,"Between 1947 and 1950, director Jules Dassin shot three revolutionary movies that shook the film noir genre. THE NAKED CITY is one of them and remains, 52 years (!) after its theatrical release, a classic not to be  forgotten. The film was shot, for its most part, in the streets of New-York  City and on location in real flats or apartments. Just consider that Howard  Hawks's THE BIG SLEEP was shot one year before and you will have an idea  why Hollywood has been called "" The Dream Factory "". The reality  depicted in Hollywood movies had nothing to do anymore with real  life.
Some critics have compared THE NAKED CITY with the realist italian  movies of this period, with Vittorio de Sica's THE BICYCLE THIEF for  instance. Anyway, the final chase which will end on the Brooklyn bridge is  already part of Movie History.
Jules Dassin's interest for social  questions can be observed in various scenes of THE NAKED CITY : Howard  Duff's desperate efforts to join the high society, the enlightening story  of the murdered girl, the constant opposition between the world of the  workers and the world of the rich.
Audio and images are of VHS quality  and the master was not of the highest quality. Filmographies of Jules  Dassin and Barry Fitzgerald as bonus features.

992598,5,6305226172,"I used to watch the TV series in the late '50s and early '60s and one night on the Late show this original film was on and I really enjoyed it.  The TV series was taken right from this in style and content, and got a little upgrade when it went from a 1/2 hour to a 1 hour format.
I have been watching my P.D. VHS of this movie for years and bought the Criterion DVD and am really glad I did.  As usual they have given it a wonderful digital transfer.  The picture is beautiful and the sound is crisp and clear.  The only footage that shows any lack of detail is the aerial footage at the start of the film and that may have been stock footage.
I do not consider this a noir film, it has elements of noir, as in the murder scenes, but the police work is shown in good lighting and everyday acting, showing that the cops are the opposite of the criminals.  The story is good, a standard murder tale, with the cops doing what they do in the REAL world, slow methodical work, lots of walking and asking questions and checking files.  Investigating the crime scene they do forensic work, including vacuuming the scene for fibers, etc., something unexpected for 1947.
Some comments have been made about the acting.  Barry Fitzgerald does an good job of playing Lt. Muldoon, slow and methodical in his approach.  For some reason most viewers expect him to only play drunken/pixie/leprechaun parts and if he does something else it is considered no good because he has an Irish brogue (kind of racist on their part).  Some have said the acting is wooden but to me it comes across as depicting real people, such as the mother of the slain girl.
The location work for the film started a trend in American films, like the Italian Neo-realist films did in Europe, but theirs were done out of necessity as many of the studios were destroyed in the war.  Many films and TV series used elements first used in this picture (Naked City (TV), On the Waterfront, Dragnet, Law & Order).
All in all a good film and a GREAT DVD,",1389571200,3,2006,4.353887399463807

992601,5,6305226172,"This murder mystery is definitely one of the best American movies ever made and ranks up there with films like High Noon.

The main character is an unorthodox detective who is short and jolly with a heavy Irish brogue.  His performance adds some comedy to the story and some of the characters are a bit overly stereotypical.  Nevertheless he does a good job and the plot is captivating.

But the most important aspect of the film is that it was shot on location in New York and ends up being like a documentary as it gives you a picture of what the city looked like in 1948.  This includes the cars, the buildings, the way people dressed, and how they were mostly slim at that time.  It is interesting that parts of the city were already run down.  It is partly narrated which adds to the documentary effect.

It provides a contrast with High Noon which depicted a bygone era where one man could save a town.  Naked City shows a city teeming with people where criminals and the police can do little more than do their job.

As the plot unfolds you see various authentic background scenes such as girls playing jump rope on the street or adults playing tennis below the action on the bridge where the final scene takes place.  It is said that this film comes from the Film Noir genre but I would classify it as American Neorealism.",1385510400,,1330,4.432098765432099

992657,5,6305226172,"Noir City DC is an annual festival of noir film presented at the American Flim Institute in Silver Spring. On a Saturday afternoon, Noir City DC presented two ""naked"" films: Naked Alibi and the more famous film I am reviewing here, The Naked City. It was a pleasure to see noir film in a period theater in the company of a good-sized audience of people who share an interest in noir on the screen. The Film Noir Foundation, which is devoted to the preservation and appreciation of noir film, cosponsors the festival. A director of the Foundation offered an informative introduction to ""The Naked City"".

Released in 1948 and directed by Jules Dassin, ""The Naked City"" won two Academy Awards for cinematography and for film editing. The Library of Congress has included the film on the National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aethetically significant.""

As the Academy Awards suggest, the value of this movie lies more in the photography than in any details of plot or acting. The story is filmed almost entirely in the New York City of 1947 and offers an irreplaceable look at America's metropolis.  There are panoramas of the city from the sky and from the water.  The movie captures bustling crowds and quiet streets, children and the aged, the rich and poor. Besides the panorama, the movie includes small and specific scenes, of a horse-drawn cart in early morning, a woman sweeping the streets, a DJ wondering to himself whether anyone is listening and more.
New York's storied Lower East Side receives a great deal of attention with its lively outdoor stands, pushcart vendors, storefronts, and cheap apartments. It was moving to see this now largely vanished New York City in both realistic and imaginative film work.  The highly dramatic final scene of the movie features an extended chase which occurs on the Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side.

Besides the outstanding city photography, ""The Naked City"" features the narration of its producer, Mark Hellinger which gives the movie its own original character.  Hellinger speaks in a tough New York voice as he leads the viewer through the city and its places and people. Hellinger's voice encourages reflection on city life and people as he emphasizes that each person in New York's eight million has his or own life and story to tell.

The movie's plot centers upon the murder of a young model who has lived too fast and too promiscuously. The primary character is a veteran homicide detective, Lieutenant Dan Muldoon played by Barry Fitzgerald.  Muldoon is slow and meticulous rather than glamorous as he works patiently with small clues and gradually solves the case. Other characters include a dissolute young playboy, Frank Niles, played by Howard Duff and Ted de Corsia as the brutal Willie Garza and Don Taylor as Muldoon's assistant, Detective Jimmy Halloran. Halloran is shown in his modest New York brownstone with his young family.

The climax of the story is the lengthy chase scene over the Williamsburg bridge. For the most part, the plot is secondary to the views of city life and places that provide the background as Muldoon solves the crime. Contrary to some noir, the film adopts a celebratory tone towards city life and to the police for their efforts at keeping peace and bringing wrongdoers to justice.

I have been reading a good deal of noir fiction of late and have wanted to get to know something of noir film. I was glad to see this famous noir film's portrayal of New York City life presented as part of the cultural life of my own city of Washington, D.C.

992660,5,6305226172,"The Naked City is a 1948 black-and-white film noir, based on a story by Malvin Wald, and directed by Jules Dassin. The film depicts the police investigation that follows the murder of a young model. It was given two Academy Awards: One to William Daniels for his cinematography, and another to Paul Weatherwax for film editing.

Julius ""Jules"" Dassin (1911-2008) was an American film director of Jewish-Russian origins. One of eight children of a Russian-Jewish barber in Connecticut, Dassin grew up in Harlem and went to Morris High School in the Bronx. He joined the Communist Party USA in the 1930s and left it after the Hitler-Stalin Pact in 1939.

He started as a Yiddish actor with the ARTEF (Yiddish Proletarian Theater) company in New York. He collaborated on a film with Jack Skurnick that was incomplete because of Skurnick's early death. In the 1940s, Dassin quickly became better known for his noir films Brute Force, The Naked City, and Thieves' Highway.

In 1948, Darryl F Zanuck  informed him he would be blacklisted, but he still had enough time to make a movie for Fox. Dassin was blacklisted in Hollywood during the production of Night and the City in 1950. He did not work as a film director again until Rififi in 1955 (a French production), which became his most influential film, an early work in the ""heist film"" genre.

Most of Dassin's films in the decades following the blacklist are European productions. His prolific later career in Europe and the affiliation with Greece through his second wife, Melina Mercouri, combined with the common pronunciation of his surname led to an assumption that he was Greek or French.

For his 1956 film Rififi, Dassin earned the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival.  His 1960 film Never on Sunday earned the music Academy Award (Manos Hadjidakis) and the Cannes Film Festival best actress award (Melina Mercouri). In 1982, he was a member of the jury at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival.

The Naked City depicts the police investigation that follows the murder of a young model. A veteran cop is placed in charge of the case and he sets about, with the help of other beat cops and detectives, to find the girl's killer. The movie, shot partially in documentary style, was filmed on location on the streets of New York City and features landmarks such as the Williamsburg Bridge, the Whitehall Building, and an apartment building on West 83rd Street in Manhattan as the scene of the murder.

The visual style of The Naked City was inspired by New York photographer Weegee, who published a book of photographs of New York life entitled Naked City (1945). Weegee was hired as a visual consultant on the film, and is credited with helping to craft its imagery. Fiolm historian William Park has argued that the film owes its visual style more to Italian neorealism than to Weegee's photographic work.

At the time, film critic Bosley Crowther wrote ""Thanks to the actuality filming of much of its action in New York, a definite parochial fascination is liberally assured all the way and the seams in a none-too-good whodunnit are rather cleverly concealed. And thanks to a final, cops-and-robbers ""chase"" through East Side Manhattan and on the Williamsburg Bridge, a generally talkative mystery story is whipped up to a roaring 'Hitchcock.""

992663,2,6305226172,"""The Naked City"" represented a change in crime films away from the theatrical guns and molls of the 30s (""Public Enemy"", ""Little Caesar"", ""Scarface"") and the film noir of the 40s (""Maltese Falcon"", ""Double Indemnity"") to a more realistic POV. Of course, guns and molls and film noir continued, but slowly the more realistic crime drama emerged (""On the Waterfront"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""The Phenix City Story""), and ""Naked City"" became a popular TV series (1958-63).

This new wave of crime drama had several features. They were almost always shot on location (usually New York), in black and white, often based on true events, and often utilized voice over. Although violence and gun fire were included, they were not the main focus. This subgenre of film was easily transferred to the small screen and gave birth to many of the early crime dramas on TV (""Martin Kane, Private Eye"", ""Public Defender"", ""Justice"").

So if ""The Naked City"" has some historical importance as one of the first of a successful subgenre, how well does it stand the test of time? Unfortunately not too well. Barry Fitzgerald was a wonderful actor, but he is adrift at sea as the Lieutenant in charge, and his thick Irish accent is difficult to understand. His fellow actors (Howard Duff as a suspect, Don Taylor as a detective, Walter Burke as a small time thief) appear uncomfortable in their roles, perhaps because this was one of the first films of its type.

FWIW - if you look closely you'll see all kinds of actors in small parts in this film who went on to great careers - Look for Nehemiah Persoff, Paul Ford, Bruce Gordon, James Gregory, John Marley, David Opatposhu, and John Randolph among others.

What does stand the test of time is the great black and white photography of William Daniels (1901-70). Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim. Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won for this film.

Jules Dassin (1911-2008) directs. Dassin did a number of film noir movies (""Thieves Highway"", ""Night and the City"") before getting in trouble during the HUAC witch hunt and left for Europe where he made ""Rififi"" (1955), one of the earliest heist movies. In 1961 he was nominated for an Oscar as director and writer for ""Never on Sunday"".

Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (""A Double Life"", ""Spellbound"", ""Ben Hur""). He was particularly adept in the film noir genre (""Double Indemnity"", ""Brute Force"", ""The Killers"", ""The Asphalt Jungle"") and his work in this film is excellent, showing that less is more.

FWIW - Dassin, Daniels, and Rozsa worked together on ""Brute Force"" (1947) just before doing this film.

In 1948, Bogart and Huston teamed up to make the #4 (""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"")and #12 (""Key Largo"")top grossing films of the year and went on to win two Oscars (Director, Supporting Actor). Other top 10 grossing films were ""The Red Shoes"", ""The Three Musketeers"", ""Red River"", ""Easter Parade"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""The Snake Pit"" and ""Joan of Arc"".

""Naked City"" won an Oscar for Daniels and for Paul Weatherwax (Editing) and was nominated for Best Writing.

If you're particularly interested in film history, this film will appeal to you because it was such an innovative film. And the photography and music are still first rate, but the acting and the script leave a lot to be desired by modern standards.

Bottom line - great historical importance but doesn't stand the test of time.",1317686400,5,3726,4.824451410658307

992665,4,6305226172,"No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various crime noir efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, femme fatale to muddy the waters also get a pass. Some, such as the film under review from 1946, The Naked City, offer neither although the stark New York City cinematography and the voice-over narration place it firmly in the genre. This film is that old noir stand-by from the period, the police procedural with its never-ending cautionary tale about how ""crime does not pay.""

A little plot summary is in order. Yes, New York City, well the New York City of the 1940s and 1950s had eight million stories, although maybe really just two, rich and poor, or maybe better getting richer or sliding down poorer, but that is the subject for another day. Of course telling eight million stories, other than as a few seconds relief slice-of-life scenes, would make me very sleepy, very sleepy indeed. So the plot line reduces the sleepiness to a minimum by telling one story, or rather one murder story that wraps quite a few people in its tentacles, including one major city homicide squad. A squad led by perennial Irish actor Barry Fitzgerald as the foot-sore but worldly-wise detective in charge. The grift (profit motive) that drives the story line is stealing jewelry from those self-same getting richer New York City swells, including an inside society swell finger man. But things turn awry when one drop-dead beautiful model (maybe I should not have used just that phrase, but I will let it stand) winds up being murdered by her some of her thieving confederates.

The twists and turns, such as they are, revolve around a mystery man lover, suitor, whatever it was never really clear, except he was daffy over that drop-dead beautiful model, and finding him as the logical guy to have done, or ordered the murder. In New Jack City and elsewhere that is hard to do, one and one half hours hard to do. But in the end Barry and his homicide squad cohorts get their man, a strangely agile bad man for noir who are usually just straight thugs. And the city moves on to the next...murder, mayhem or whatever. Not exactly my cup of tea in noir but if I recall this film was the model for a television series of the same name so somebody must have though well of it beyond the slice-of-New York life scenes interspersed in the story and the great black and white cinematography of the Big Apple just after the end of World War II.",1310947200,2,2781,4.627530364372469

I'd seen this decades ago and barely recalled it when I saw it on a few lists of the best noirs recently. Good film noir (Double Indemnity, Maltese Falcon, DOA, etc) has a sense of cynical intelligence that Naked City is woefully lacking, though, to these eyes and ears. This is not really a noir, but merely a very well-shot standard police procedural, and not even an especially gripping one.

The cinematography of mid-'40s New York is clearly the star here, and the city looks crisp and oddly clean in this typically excellent Criterion restoration. Naked City is worth watching for that alone, no doubt. But the woefully standard story did absolutely nothing for me but induce boredom. The dialogue has none of the crackling wit and bite of the best noirs, and the plot is exceedingly mundane. The acting is mostly average at best, and only Barry Fitzgerald stands out with his wry portrayal of a NYC homicide detective. But where's the edge in all these characters? They all seem so vanilla and predictable; there's nothing here I haven't seen a hundred times elsewhere, and done better.

Except the photography. But truly, that's the only reason I'd recommend this. The Criterion edition has some fine extras, including a nice interview with director Dassin from 2004, a good commentary track, and some other interesting critical looks at the film. They all seem to worship Naked City as a real ground-breaker, and while that may be very true, and it might have been a big deal at the time, it sure as heck did little for me other than soothe the eyes. Maybe I'm just missing the whole ball o' wax (certainly possible), but I found Naked City to be all in all just plain boring, except for its fine cinematography.

Not even close to the truly great noirs, and not really even a noir per se, Naked City looks great but never once made me think, ""Now that's a great line!"", or even, ""Interesting idea."" It was fun to watch NYC in its heyday...but that's all.",1307577600,4,1975,4.666666666666667

992734,5,6305226172,"As written on the DVD cover, THE NAKED CITY is a blend of Italian Neorealism and American crime fiction; a melding of Naturalism and police procedural.  I have often seen it over-praised for its contribution to film noir style.  Gritty realism was apparent in many noir movies prior to 1948, and the procedural film had been done previously as well; multiple times in fact, by producer Louis De Rochemont.  Good examples of this are THE HOUSE ON 92nd STREET (1945) and especially BOOMERANG! (1947). A third good example (done by another producer) is Anthony Mann's T-MEN (1947).

Instead, 1948 may be best seen as the year where films like THE NAKED CITY and (soon to follow) CRY OF THE CITY followed the trend away from the German Expressionist view of noir urbanisation.  Instead of the city being an agent of a cold, uncaring Fate, we have a warmer, more nuanced city; very much alive and organic; almost a character in the plot:  a product of the Italian Neorealists.  It is little wonder that viewers feel that there is something new on the noir horizon; there is just a little confusion about what that something is, in some circles.  Ironically, it is as if the German Expressionist city; the one that dominates American film noir up to this point, is the naked one; rainswept, distant and chilly.  If anything, THE NAKED CITY adds colour, flavor vitality and hope; dressing up the metropolis with the lifeways of its inhabitants.

Like the De Rochemont pictures, THE NAKED CITY is very much a producer's film; but in this case Mark Hellinger produced.  Hellinger produced a total of three noir films for Universal; THE KILLERS (1946), BRUTE FORCE (1947), and THE NAKED CITY before succumbing to a heart attack, December 21, 1947.  All of these films are well regarded, high quality ventures.

For this, his last picture, Hellinger (who also narrates) was able to obtain Jules Dassin, William Daniels, Miklos Rozsa, Frank Skinner, and Barry Fitzgerald.  It is no wonder such a good film was made, and often imitated.  One wonders whether this movie was the inspiration for Anthony Mann's work on SIDE STREET (1950), especially his excellent overhead shots of the city; or if it influenced the finale in WHITE HEAT (1949)?

One thing is certain; the plot, which involves the police procedure used to solve the murder of an ex-model, seems rather uninspired.  But mating this thread with an almost ethnographic documentary of 1940s New York was a brilliant stroke.  Combined with Daniels cinematography, and Paul Weatherwax's superb editing (few films are so reliant on pace); not to mention the Rozsa and Skinner score, Hellinger and Dassin manufactured one remarkable, interesting film.",1276560000,2,2693,4.959910913140312
992735,4,6305226172,"There was a time when director Jules Dassin created films presenting some societal or human anomaly that eventually got resolved. ""The Naked City"" is one of them. A murder took place, homicide is put on the case, finds the guy and.... Of course this is a far too simplistic and superficial synopsis of this splendid and gripping film but in many ways ""The Naked City"" contrasts with Dassin's later movie ""Rififi"", which presents a much grimmer and doomful view of society and mankind. Be that as it may, this piece is definitely worth watching on itself and should be regarded an outstanding film noir.

This film was made in the year I was born and  I regret I was never able to see the city as it was then, sure there are many improvements but there will never be another period in the history of NYC to match this one.",1230854400,6,709,4.160583941605839

Dassin handles the action with matter-of-fact directness, and soon fast-talking Frank Niles (Howard Duff) has raised their interest. But the great achievement of ""City"" is its verisimilitude of character and place, and a final chase scene on the Williamsburg Bridge that will steal your breath away. There might be ""8 million stories in the naked city,"" but this sinister crime drama was the first--and still the best.

The Irish affected Fitzgerald barely carries the lead, and the rest of the acting is simply putrid, horribly ham handed.  I watched the scene with the mother identifying her dead daughter, and all I could think of is that she had another job that afternoon and had to emote quick and flee.  The preceding scene where the young cop comes home to handle spanking his kid is completely pointless, and the acting by husband and wife is soap opera quality at best, just awful.

It gets worse, there's a narrative track would embarrass a ""Dragnet"" episode, syrupy strings in the soundtrack, and dialogue that often wanders off point, making it difficult to follow.  All the side bits just waste time, the action doesn't move from scene to scene in a form which builds any sense of continuity.  I couldn't even finish watching it, so I guess I'll never know who Mcillicuddy was.

992795,4,6305226172,"""The Naked City"" is a police procedural with the emphasis on ""procedure"", not on story or characters. Directed by Jules Dassin with Oscar-winning cinematography by William Daniels, it takes us step-by-step through the ups and downs, frustrations and dangers of a police murder investigation in New York City circa 1947. Its heroes are ordinary, unglamorous cops whose methodical work and dedication to duty will inevitably restore order and rid the city of dangerous elements. The film takes its title from tabloid photographer WeeGee's (Arthur Fellig) famous book of New York street photos. Ironically, WeeGee's crime and vice photos don't imply a secure or tidy world in any way.

""The Naked City"" presents itself as a quasi-documentary from the first frames with a narration by producer Mark Hellinger. Hellinger introduces himself and the rest of the creative team, highlights the location shooting in New York City, and proceeds with a narration that will last the length of the film and tour the city. We see two men leave a young woman for dead in the middle of the night. Police identify her as a dress model named Jean Dexter. A very Irish veteran homicide detective Lt. Dan Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald) and his young partner Jimmy Halloran (Don Taylor) are assigned the case. They follow leads in every direction, tracking down a pair of pajamas, false confessions, a harmonica-playing hoodlum, and Frank Niles (Howard Duff), a suspicious acquaintance of the deceased.

In the words of NYU film studies professor Dana Polan, ""The Naked City"" is ""the flip side of film noir"". It's a crime drama whose intention is to reassure the audience that the world is a safe, orderly place, and, if it should go off-kilter, the authorities will put it right. If the story were told from the perspective of prodigal, foolish Frank Niles, it would have been noir. Instead, ""The Naked City"" eschews iconoclasm and introversion and glorifies the ordered, predictable way of life that became the post-war ideal. Along with lifestyle propaganda, the film excels in capturing the city. It doesn't show New York's underbelly, but it does take us to an extraordinary 107 locations all over the city. If you want to see New York's streets and neighborhoods in the 1940s, this is better than a travelogue. If you can get past the superficiality, dull characters, and occasionally stifling message, ""The Naked City"" is a wonderful portrait of New York.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2007): Bonus features are 3 interviews, a Stills Gallery of over 50 posters and photographs, and an audio commentary. ""Dana Polan Interview"" (28 min) presents NYU film studies professor Polan's analysis of the film's themes of reassurance and blandness, the role of the ethnic communities, and its presentation of ordinary folk. ""James Sanders Interview"" (25 min) is with architect Sanders, who discusses New York's historical relationship with cinema, capturing life in the city in the 1940s, some locations, and the final chase scene. Both of these interviews are very worthwhile. ""Jules Dassin at LACMA"" (40 min) is a 2004 interview in which Dassin discusses his career with Bruce Goldstein. It is entertaining at times but too long and suffers from poor sound quality. The audio commentary by screenwriter Malvin Wald addresses the film's 2 primary innovations: applying documentary technique to an entire city and the idea that crimes are solved by police procedures, not independent investigators. Wald also talks about the research he did to write the movie, how the production came together, and the copycat police buddy movies and tv shows that followed.",1175126400,5,3631,5.150847457627119
992796,5,6305226172,"Mark Hellinger was one of the most popular syndicated columnists to ever write about his home base of New York City.  In the forties he decided to move into the ranks of movie producers as he signed on with Universal and established himself as a stellar attraction in the new area as well.

Hellinger began with a low budget sleeper triumph that has become a reigning film noir classic with the 1946 release ""The Killers.""  Not only was the film, directed by noir giant Robert Siodmak, a gigantic success.  In the film Hellinger launched no less than three great stars in Burt Lancaster, Ava Gardner and Edmond O'Brien.

""Naked City"" was Hellinger's second and regrettably last effort before his death.  The star was in many ways the city where he had been born and raised and achieved fame, New York City.  It is Hellinger's voice one hears serving as narrator, describing the city and the developing story with succinct realism.
Ted de Corsia and Tom Pedi, two character-acting regulars noted for noir and crime drama appearances, also turn in fine efforts. De Corsia, in his customary fashion, is cast as a tough villain who plays a major role in the film's resolution.  Pedi, often cast as a gangster, plays a police detective this time.
The film is a testimonial to great semi-documentary filmmaking.  It stars Barry Fitzgerald and Don Taylor as two Irish cops named Muldoon and Halloran.  Fitzgerald four years earlier copped an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor playing a veteran Irish priest breaking in younger priest Bing Crosby in ""Going My Way.""  In this film Fitzgerald breaks in young and dedicated fellow officer Taylor, who would soon be playing Elizabeth Taylor's husband to be in ""Father of the Bride,"" where he endeavors to endear himself to future father in law Spencer Tracy.

Fitzgerald and Taylor sparkle as a team.  Viewers get the feel that they know each other well and work together with camaraderie and the mutual desire to serve the public.  Fitzgerald as the canny veteran seeks to impart knowledge to the younger man while also respecting his insights as someone seeing things from a fresher and newer perspective.

Jules Dassin directed ""Naked City"" just prior to leaving America for London after the tragic Hollywood Ten purge began.  One of the writers of ""The Naked City"" was Albert Maltz, who was one of the Hollywood Ten.  Dassin uses his New York location brilliantly just as he would use London in the same way in the 1950 film noir drama ""Night and the City.""

The team of Hellinger and Dassin was so determined to get things right and show New York City as it exists by day and is lived by its citizenry sans glitz that it was shot entirely there without studio interiors.  Some of the best candid shots occurred with the cameraman shooting from inside a truck so the locals would be captured as they actually were with supreme spontaneity.

Hellinger's admirable ability for discerning talent and stories left us begging for more following his untimely death.  His next project, which he helped get off the ground at Universal, was the tremendous film noir hit ""Crisscross,"" which has also become a classic.  This 1949 gem starred Hellinger's leading man from ""The Killers"" Burt Lancaster with Universal's top female star of the period, Yvonne De Carlo, playing the ruthless femme fatale he cannot get out of his system, even after divorcing her.

It had been Hellinger's idea to make Los Angeles the photographic star and vortex for ""Crisscross"" just as New York City had served such a valuable purpose in ""Naked City.""  Robert Siodmak, who had earlier directed ""The Killers,"" carried out that objective with consummate fidelity.",1174867200,4,4364,4.845013477088949
992841,3,6305226172,"We just watched NAKED CITY on Turner Classics followed by HE WALKED BY NIGHT. Half-way through the latter film, I had to check the cable guide just to make sure that it was actually released the same year as NAKED CITY.

Some consider NAKED CITY groundbreaking but I found it more of a curiosity. From the look and sound of it, producer Mark Hellinger was simply aping Italy's neo realistic genre popularized by movies like OPEN CITY and BICYCLE THIEF (also released in 1948). NAKED CITY's grating non-stop voice over, the casting of Barry Fitzgerald (mugging like a refugee from a John Ford film)and, ultimately, a heavy-handed director, reveal a production that has not aged well. And it suffers badly when viewed in proximity to the likes of HE WALKED BY NIGHT which offers a creepily compelling performance by Richard Basehart as the killer. Scott Brady, Roy Roberts and Jack Webb are absolutely solid as LA cops, coloring their roles with low-keyed authority. NAKED CITY did achieve a genuinely gritty look because of talented folks like DP Bill Daniels, Designer John De Cuir and their respective teams. However, the rest of the film's assets are wasted and don't approach the cool, understated docudrama style of HE WALKED BY NIGHT. Much of that film's effectiveness is now being credited to a young Anthony Mann.

Oddly, HE WALKED BY NIGHT feels more ""real"" than NAKED CITY's ""neo-real"". I would think that the latter is of more interest to the film student while HE WALKED BY NIGHT is far more entertaining.",1173830400,5,1516,4.872093023255814

The opening sequence of the 1947 NYC skyline from high above is one of my favorites. It is like a time capsule from 60 years ago. The city, is recognizable yet, so different today. This movie is done entirely on location. Mr. Hellinger talks about the pulse of the city as it moves from night to day & night again. The people of the city are the real stars, many, just living their lives, unaware of the camera. It is the template for so many of the tv & movie crime drama that followed. Eventually, Mr. Hellinger segue-ways into the story. A beautiful, young, model has been murderd in her apartment late at night & the cops are clueless. In a bit of quirky casting, Barry Fitzgerald is Lt. Dan Muldoon, an old, grizzled homocide detective. He not super-cop & that's the point. His partner, is callow detective Jimmy Halloran, energetic with lots of shoe leather. Howard Duff has a big part as the cop's theiving, lying suspect. He knew the murdered girl quite well. But he has an alibi. Good plot. Not noir but something a little different that bridges the gap between war & post war noir. Lots a little kids in the street scenes perhaps the oldest of the boomers. All the cops seem to be Irish. Most of the rest seem to be Jewish or Italian. In the only failing New York City seems to have is there are no people of color, that is no Blacks, Asian or Hispanic to be seen on the entire island.",1173830400,,1655,4.4295081967213115

My father, John De Cuir, was the Art Director on this film and I remember his recounting the cast and crew adventures of shooting an ""on location"" film at that time.

Also, I recall his account of how he stayed up all night the night before the bridge shoot, hand drawing each story-board angle of that famous last chase scene (it was a ""new"" ending to the script), and figuring out how to position the camera to achieve those extreme angles so they would not waste a moment of their ""stolen"" limited time on that bridge. It had to be so exciting and freeing for them to film entirely on location.

The Academy did a tribute to him at the Director's Guild a few years back and screened this film as an example of his ""early"" black and white work and THE KING AND I as a very different example of his contrasting work Cinemascope in musicals.

Fascinating and pioneering stuff for that time.

992845,4,6305226172,"""The Naked City"" was released in 1948, and Barry Fitzgerald stars as Irishman, Det. Lt. Dan Muldoon.  New York City is the scene, and a young woman has been murdered in the bathtub, creating sensational headlines for every newspaper and scandal sheet in the city.  Muldoon and his detectives scour the mean streets of the city searching for the murderer.

Directed by Jules Dassin, who would later go on to make several entertaining crime caper flicks (""Rififi,"" ""Topkapi""), ""The Naked City"" stands as one of the grittier films of the 1940s.  The movie was filmed on location, which was rare, as most studio films were shot on the backlots.  Thus, we get to see various NYC neighborhoods and the people on the streets -- the film is a wonderful time capsule of what NYC was like right after WWII.

Today, however, the movie doesn't seem gritty at all -- no more than any of a hundred episodes of ""Law and Order"" or one of its spin-offs.  In addition, filming on location in cities was relatively new in 1948; as a result, the sound is horrific, with many scenes being heavily looped by the actors.  In addition, a somewhat over-bearing narration by producer Marc Hellinger, a newspaper man himself who died of a heart attack at age 44 years right before ""The Naked City"" was released, sometimes threatens to drown out the action.

Other elements, though, more than compensate, including seeing Fitzgerald cast against type -- usually he plays kindly roles, such as his Oscar-winning character, Father Fitzgibbon, from ""Going My Way.""  The movie also does a nice job of examining the impact the murder has on various people throughout the city.  The film ultimately won two Oscars for editing and black & white cinematography and was nominated for best writing (lost to ""The Search"").  At times, one needs to recall that ""The Naked City"" was groundbreaking for its time to fully enjoy it.  Nevertheless, the movie is a solid and enjoyable 1940s police/crime drama, which also lead to the successful 1950s TV show.  Highly recommended.",1117238400,7,2033,4.855072463768116
992846,5,6305226172,"Jules Dassin's meritorious 1948 flick ""The Naked City"" was beautifully and ambitiously filmed in the streets of New York by respected cinematographer William Daniels.  The movie was based on an investigation conducted by the NY police department surrounding the murder of an attractive blonde model Jean Dexter.  She was discovered by her housekeeper drowned in her bathtub after being rendered unconscious by chloroform.  The housekeeper revealed that Ms. Dexter had been involved with a middle aged gentleman named Mr. Henderson.

Dimutative Barry Fitzgerald, playing homicide detective lieutenant Dan Muldoon is heading the inquest. His minions soon turn up Howard Duff playing deceitful ne'er do well Frank Niles an alleged mechandise buyer who used Ms. Dexter's services to help in his business.  The trouble was that inquiry revealed that he had no business and his finances were in disarray.  His fiance Ruth Morrison, was a model who worked with Dexter, played by the exquisite Dorothy Hart.  Another player in this drama was a Dr. Stoneman played by silver haired House Jameson, who had prescribed medication for Ms. Dexter.

All the suspects were being kept under tight surveillance.  The oily Duff was observed pawning an expensive cigarette case which was found to have been stolen.  The engagement ring he had given to Ms. Morrison was also stolen.  A connection between a jewelry theft ring was made and Duff was interrogated for more information.

Clues procured by Fitzgerald and an apparently related drowning murder committed just after Ms. Dexter's death lead to a citywide manhunt for the suspected murderer.

The unquestioned highlight of ""The Naked City"" was the documentary style of the film resulting from the superlative cinematography.  The finale filmed on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and the chase scene amid the erector set steel girders of the Williamsburgh Bridge were both masterfully executed.",1116720000,9,1931,5.33003300330033
992847,5,6305226172,"This film is wonderful. At first I had a problem with Barry Fitzgerald as the lead then I stopped to think about real life in that era and understood that it was not as we see it portrayed these days with the Mel Gibson/Kevin Costner types in the lead roles. In all probability a guy like Barry Fitzgerald would have been a detective back then. The other standouts are Don Taylor,Howard Duff and Mark Hellinger's narration. Director Jules Dassin went on to make some of the best gritty crime films of that generation. This movie was 50 years ahead of it's time and did for it's type of film what Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues did years later. The magic of this movie is that after you see it you keep thinking about it, the real scenes of New York City keep coming back and it dawns on you that you are looking back 50 plus years in time to a then real New York City that no longer exists. Watch it several times, you see more things over and over that you missed the first go around. Film makers today need to get back to the basics of story telling and stop relying on effects and shock. They should study Dassin's works.",1108512000,8,1126,4.266355140186916
992848,1,6305226172,"The review says ""With a helicopter shot slowly closing in on Manhattan"". This was late 1940's...only the Germans used helicopters (during the end of the war) in the  1940s. Perhaps it was a Blimp (or airplane at slow speed), but I'd bet big money it was NOT a helicopter taking that shot of Manhattan.",1107043200,,301,4.574074074074074
992849,4,6305226172,"There are two styles of Film Noir.  Fueled by writers like James M. Cain, Dashiell Hammett, and Raymond Chandler, the first style emerged in the 1940s and was characterized by a cynical, often witty tone; anti-heroes, dangerous women, and assorted criminal elements; and complex plots that emphasized betrayal and moral ambiguity.  It was also photographed in a remarkable visual style that combined glossy production values with atmospheric emphasis on light and shadow--and films like THE MALTESE FALCON, THIS GUN FOR HIRE, MILDRED PIERCE, THE BLUE DAHLIA, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY remain great classics of their kind.

But after World War II public taste began to change.  Things that could only be hinted at in earlier films could now be more directly stated, and as audiences clamored for a more gritty realism the glossy sophistication of 1940s Noir fell out of fashion.  The result was a new style of Noir--photographed in a grainier way, more direct, more brutal, and even less sympathetic to its characters.  And the 1948 THE NAKED CITY was among the first to turn the tide.  The sophisticated gumshoe, slinky gun moll, and glossy production values were gone; this film felt more like something you might read in a particularly lurid ""true detective"" tabloid.

In an era when most films were shot on Hollywood backlots, THE NAKED CITY was actually filmed in New York--and while filmmakers could film with hidden cameras sound technology of the day posed a problem.  But producer Mark Hellinger turned the problem into an asset: the film would be narrated, adding to the documentary-like style of the cinematography and story.  (Hellinger performed the narrative himself, and his sharp delivery is extremely effective.)  The story itself reads very much like a police report, following NYPD detectives as they seek to solve a dress model's murder.

For 1948 it was innovative stuff-but like many innovative films it falters a bit in comparison to later films that improved upon the idea.  The direct nature of the plot feels slightly too direct, slightly too simple.  The same is true of the performances, which have a slightly flat feel, and although Barry Fitzgerald gives a sterling performance he is very much a Hollywood actor whose style seems slightly out of step alongside the deadpan style of the overall cast.  Even so, the pace and drive of the film have tremendous interest, and while you might find yourself criticizing certain aspects you'll still be locked into the movie right to the very end.  Particularly recommended for Film Noir addicts, who will be fascinated to see the turning point in the style.

992850,5,6305226172,"I can't remember another movie that took as many chances as THE NAKED CITY and successfully pulled it off.  It doesn't look quite like any movie I've seen before and doesn't play quite like any other movie.
 The story is simply enough - a young model is found murdered and the Homicide Squad is called in to solve the case.
 Even before the murder, though, we're introduced to something new.  We're given and aerial sweep and pan shot of the skyline of New York City.  A voice over narrator emphatically tells us that this movie was NOT photographed in a studio; the stars perform ""in the streets, in the apartment houses, in the skyscrapers of New York City itself.""  And so it is.  No matter how well the set is designed, you can usually spot it as quickly as you can CG animation, and this ALL looks like NYC to me.
 The casting is out of the ordinary, as well.  I mean, Barry Fitzgerald as top-star in a crime story?  Come on.  Get serious.  Yeah, maybe if you want a pleasant little slightly inebriated Irish chap - but a homicide detective? Yeah, right.
 But it works.  Fitzgerald is just right as Lt. Daniel Muldoon because this movie doesn't rely on Mike Hammer-ish brutality, or a brilliant and intuitive crime solver.  I think the film makers here were looking for a cast who could meld into the city rather than rise above it, and Fitzgerald is a surprising and inspired choice.
 This is a movie about dusting for fingerprints and putting evidence in plastic bags.  It's about wearing out shoes interviewing potential witnesses and striking out 90% of the time.  The Fitzgerald character works because he fits into the world better than a major star would have.  The film-makers seem to be striving for a documentary feel to things (I trying not to use the term cinema veritie here).
 Scenes are bracketed by location street scenes - hordes of people entering a subway station, a horse-drawn milk cart and milkman on a quiet city street, two young women admiring a gown in an upscale store window.
 There's a price to be paid for relying exclusively on location shots.  There are a few scenes that sound like the voice recording were done in an echo chamber.  And the film has a flat look to it (not all that bad for a noir-ish crime drama.)  The reason we can tell studio shots so quickly is because they look good - the photographer has control over lighting and light sourcing.
 If there are detective movies and gangster movies and any number of other sub-genres in the Crime category, I guess you'd call this a police procedural movie.  There are a couple of punches thrown and a few guns fired, but for the most part attention lingers on characters and procedures.  This is one of the first movies, to my knowledge, that seems to recognize that crimes are more likely solved in the lab than in the brain of an inspired crime fighter.
 I unhesitatingly recommend this to everybody.  For crime and noir buffs, this is a must see.",1083456000,69,2944,4.564885496183206

It begins with an aerial view of lower Manhattan facing north. It is a hot summer night. Some people work at night. A milkman delivers bottles to an apartment house. One man clubs another and throws his body into the river! In the morning people go to work. A houseworker discovers a body! The police are notified. The victim is 26 years old, a model. The bruises show it was murder. Mens pajamas are found in the hamper. The victims valuable jewelry is missing! Her prescription is investigated, so too her last place of work. [Note the few cars in the streets.] Frank Niles is caught in lies! He has no steady job but a good alibi. Bruises say two men killed Jean Dexter. The girls parents show up at the mortuary for an emotional scene. Later a mans body is found in the river. Detectives search for leads.

They learn more about Frank Niles, and stolen jewelry. They meet Ruth Morrison again; she was given a stolen ring. A man runs from Niles apartment, shots are fired! Niles was chloroformed. He is questioned again, he says he got the item from Jean Dexter! Jimmy Halloran learns more about that drowned man and his friend Willie. They find a lead and look for Willie. Lt. Muldoon questions Niles again to get a name. This leads to a doctor who tells how he was used. Halloran finds Garzah, who gets away! All cars are given a signal 37 to go to that location. Willie flees, then bumps into a man. He attracts attention! Willie is trapped on a bridge! Shots are fired, and Willie comes down to end this story.

This movie wasn't as successful as others. It is like a police procedural that shows hos they solved a crime. It shows lower Manhattan in the late 1940's where there are few cars. Note the hood vents for fresh air. It shows how people lived before air conditioning. This story is a warning for those who are interested in show business but don't have the talent, experience, or connections. You can compare this to The Asphalt Jungle as a crime story.
