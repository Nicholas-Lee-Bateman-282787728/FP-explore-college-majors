2467934,1,B000CPHA24,Please do yourself a favor and just buy the import. I bought the entire series for $30. I can't believe it has taken them this long to just release the same 5 discs over and over. This is the 3rd printing of these same episodes unless you count Knights of Zodiac then it's actually the 4th. Gimme a break!!! I don't think any of us should buy and more saint seiya dvds until they release the entire series in one boxed set. How have they not figured out that what we want .. jeez. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,1229472000,7,499,4.1020408163265305
2467935,2,B000CPHA24,"Yes I appreciate the cover looks prettier than the ones before, but other than that this so-called collection 1 seems excally the same content with the one released on Feb 2006, the same title ""collection 1"" and the same contents ""750 mins"" and the same features for sure.
Anyway the point is with all this time wasted to release the same contents with just a different cover, why can't they just spend some time to work on the remaining episodes, like for example keep trying to convience Toei to liscen the remaining arcs so that we can enjoy the entire show ?",1228780800,2,562,4.519607843137255

I recommand this show to all fans of the show.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saint-Seiya-Collection-1/dp/B000CPHA24/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saint Seiya - Collection 1</a>",1178496000,3,253,9.583333333333334
2467937,4,B000CPHA24,"I first discovered saint saiya in Mexico where it was showing the sanctuary saga nad at another time the posiedon/asgard sagas. and it was awesome. This has the first 30 episodes. The dubbing at first was mediocre at best, but it gets better as the show progresses. I was disappointed that they didn't have the the special features of the single disks which had character bios, and sections about the mythologies of the constilations.",1165795200,,434,4.878378378378378
2467938,5,B000CPHA24,"Why they didn't make the rest of the T.V. chapters? After I got this collection I found online a the complete T.V. series and of course of bought it right at that moment. It has the sanctuary, The Asgard, Poseidon 5 Saint Seiya movies including the last one wich is the best movie and the one that last the most time. and 19 OVAS of the Hades. So I don't care if this company makes the rest of the collection. I allready have it. I'm just waiting on the rest of the Hades series I know they will be 27 chapters. Stop waisting money with that company guys. get the real Knigths of the zodiac ""Caballeros del Zodico"" completaly from a different company that have all of the chapters.",1156032000,3,681,4.286821705426356
2467939,1,B000CPHA24,"My husband waited for this anime for many years to get released on DVDs. I was buying all of the volume until # 12 when it stopped being released. I hate this kind of unfair behavior from the companies where they let you hanging just because it wasn't convenient for them. Since this happened with Saint seiya, I do not buy any series at all, until all the seasons get released. I do not trust they will continue even for the loyal customers that keep buying from them. My husband was very sad he could not get to watch the final episodes of the 1st saga, AT LEAST!!!!! Saint seiya is a excellent anime and it will continue to be a classic among good anime lovers!!",1143504000,2,665,4.285714285714286
2467940,1,B000CPHA24,"ADV hasn't released more episodes since May 2005. Its not worth to buy the first 30 episodes with a different box if they are going to leave you with an unfinished series. I personally love Saint Seiya, but this is really sad. I whish this series would have been picked up by a more professional distribuitor like Rhino.",1140220800,8,320,4.5344827586206895

8099972,5,B000CPHA24,I Love this Anime and ADV said idk when but here is the site to continue it. http://www.japanator.com/post.phtml?pk=9878,1418256000,2,120,5.722222222222222

8099974,5,B000CPHA24,This is one of the series that started Japanese anime in the USA. The graphics isn't the best but I still love it :),1314316800,2,116,3.875
8099975,5,B000CPHA24,"I think this is ridiculous, they make us buy 12 volumes of saint seiya that are completely useless without the remaining volumes.  It cost me roughly $150 for all the 12 volumes, so multiply that by several thousands. Where did all that money go? I think that ADV owes its fans an explanation. what i would like to know, is there any legal actions that can be taken against ADV? Now I believe that ADV is no longer in business so who is legal responsible? I want my remaining volumes!!",1266192000,,485,4.388888888888889
8099976,5,B000CPHA24,"Watching these dvds brings back the good old days when I was a kid watching Saint Seiya in the morning. The action is amazing and violent, which I love.

However, I do agree that the fact that only the first 60 episodes are being released does take away from the excitement of buying the collections. Unfortunately, I have bought both these collections and I just found the entire series including the entire hades and death of hades sagas for the same price. Its in spanish but I don't mind, because I actually prefer anime in spanish, the voice acting in spanish is way better than english. I have a friend that will buy the two collections I have so it's a win win for me.

So, I you want the entire series, don't buy this collection. Try to find and import, if you don't mind reading subtitles or if you speak spanish or japanese. If you don't care about getting the entire series then go ahead and buy this collection, you will enjoy watching an epic anime.",1241654400,6,962,4.429378531073446
8099977,5,B000CPHA24,"Well I had missed the first printing of the Saint Seiya collection sets and I have to say it is nice to have a reissue to be able to get a series quickly and easily instead of having to look all around for it or going through imports. As for the series itself it is an awesomely wonderful piece of '80's anime. The series is presented uncut so all the blood and fighting is kept intact. The series tells the tale of warriors or ""Saints"" chosen to contest for the golden armor. (The plot changes as the story goes on) Each saint is given an armor pertaining to a constellation. Along with individual armor each saint battles with a set of signature moves pertaining to their constellation. A great set for anyone who likes '80's or '90's anime and I hope there is more to come.",1232841600,7,776,4.321917808219178
