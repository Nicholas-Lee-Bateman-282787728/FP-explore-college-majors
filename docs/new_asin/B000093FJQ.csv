7988799,5,B000093FJQ,"This is an odd little film about artistic ambition, worldly success (or lack thereof), self-worth as well as self-loathing, love, friendship, and the passage of time. The themes are clear enough, but there is no grand narrative here. In fact, the point of the film seems to be that our lives and loves are not grand narratives that resemble the books or films (that we read and try to write, or watch and try to make) but more like sketchbooks (full of false starts and incompleted/imperfect fragments and no clear momentum in any one defintive direction). Thats how these characters view themselves and their artistic efforts and their relationships and their lives and that is how this film feels---not like a finished whole but more like a series of loosely joined pages/scenes that track the self along its unplotted/unrouted course.

Assayas claims the title refers less to a time of year or life than to a state of mind, and the dominant state of mind (for all four of the main characters) is uncertainty as no one in this film has a secure income nor a secure relationship (nor a secure self-image/identity). Assayas provides us with no traditional characterization nor narrative because these characters all prefer to remain undefined and unsettled. In place of narrative, we get a series of moments filmed at six-month intervals. The moments are not particularly dramatic, they are mostly just everyday conversations but from their conversations we can tell what kind of people they are and why they act the way they do with each other. The pleasure of the film is in tracking the way the characters feel about themselves and each other over the course of a few years. For instance, Gabriel (Matthieu Almaric) is initially in awe of and intimidated by what he views as his older friend Adrien's (Francois Cluzet) literary success. But over time we see that awe/admiration turn into something much more sobering. In one conversation Adrien reveals that even though he has published four novels they have not sold well and so he does not view himself as a success. This information (as well as Adrien's open-ness and honesty) strikes Gabriel as shocking/revelatory. And each time Gabriel sees Adrien, he views him less as a literary figure and more as a man with imperfections. But the film never works in obvious ways. Assayas's characters are complex and their connections to each other and the affect they have on each other (some of which they welcome and some they resist) are endlessly fascinating and never easily explained or summed up in a few sentences.

One of the more interesting aspects of a very interesting film is that Gabriel and Adrien seem much more interested in each other (even though these two have relatively few scenes together) than in their romantic relationships. When the film begins Gabriel is breaking up with one lover Jenny (Jeanne Balibar) who is steady and caring and who seems to be very good for him, and starting a relationship with Anne (Virginie Ledoyen) who is prone to fits of violence and who does not seem to be good for him. Gabriel enjoys Jenny's good sense and he enjoys Anne's unpredictability/passion but he does not seem committed to either relationship. And throughout the film, the 40 year old Adrien is in love with a 15 year old schoolgirl named Vera (Mia Hansen-Love). I suppose we can surmise that both men feel that their relative lack of material success has made them unsuitable for mature adult relationships, and that is perhaps one part of the explanation, but it also seems that both men are more interested in art (and other artists) than they are in love. And the very young Vera becomes, at different points in the film, a powerful artistic symbol for both men--a symbol of the spirit of life in art and/or art in life or some blending of the two. And since director Olivier Assayas and actress/director Mia Hansen-Love became a couple during the making of this film, it would seem she possessed the same kind of power for Assayas as well.

I don't know very much about Assayas but based on Irma Vep (1996); Late August, Early September (1998); and Summer Hours (2008), it would seem that his primary obsession is with the symbolic power of art and how we use this power to define and enhance (as well as to evade) our selves and lives. What made Irma Vep so exciting was the way Maggie (Maggie Cheung) used the character Irma Vep (perhaps cinema's first phantom/cipher, embodying both the mystery of cinema and of modern/postmodern identity/sexuality) to explore her own nature/identity and the way other characters responded to that film character versus the real person playing the role (to the extent there was any real difference). In a way, the same thing is going on in Late August, Early September (albeit in a much more subdued way) as both Adrien and Gabriel are interested in using literature to explore themselves even though they each use literature in very different ways: Adrien uses literature to express his own view of life (even if he is not particularly confident with what he can do), and Gabriel tends to tends to use literature to avoid his own life (he overvalue other literary voices/lives and undervalues his own). But for both men Vera is a symbol (of some unformed being, of some pure art/life essence, of some transcendent thing) and this more than anything else explains what it is they seek in art and in life.

Assayas will likely appeal to American audiences who enjoy independent work but who may have grown tired of what passes for ""independent"" in this country. Assayas (well-versed in painting and literature as well as cinema) is much more subtle and much more thoughtful and gives you much more to think about (and he's much more independent than many of the American independents, being interested in so many art forms gives his work a clarity and a breadth often lacking in artists who stick to one medium). And most appealing of all, he is fascinated by that thin line that separates (and joins) art and life, as many auteurs before him have been, and his work, like the work of many great auteurs before him, allows you to rethink your own relationship to and use of life and art (and view them as the intimately related mediums that they are).

Art is a combination of representation and reflection. Artists (like the New Wave directors and like Assayas) are often people who are not satisfied with other peoples representations and reflections. What made Breathless so exiciting was that it showed how its main characters respond to each other as well as how they use art to communicate who they are...even though they are never altogether certain of their identities. Late August, Early September is also a film about how people respond to each other and how they use art to communicate who they are but the characters are each much less certain of themselves and their identities. For Godard, for Assayas, art is a chance to tell a truth that has not been told. It is also a chance to show how people (themselves and their characters) use art as a kind of supplement--as a way to to add to life whatever it is they feel is missing from it (sense, order, spontaneity, certainty, something to believe in). Most art does not feel like life, most art feels like other art. But when we encounter something that feels like life (like our life), we respond. And are often inspired to make our own art (as Gabriel is at the end of this film).",1363651200,2,7455,4.7714949651433

Theres no real plot, and the emotions are never intense, but theres a lot of interesting fragments that add together to give a portrait of friends and lovers struggling to grow up and find their place in the world and with each other.

I found I liked it even more on 2nd viewing, the pieces adding up to an even more delicate but emotional experience. Not quite a great film, but a likable, intelligent and admirable one.",1308182400,,678,4.459677419354839

7988802,5,B000093FJQ,"Unlike Ozu films that are named after the time of year in which they are set, this absorbing film by French director Olivier Assayas refers more to a time of life and the feelings that accompany the awareness that one's youth is over and one's aspirations have remained unfulfilled. The title's reference to a cusp between seasons also reflects the film's interest in ""in-betweenness."" Characters are in between relationships, in between commitments, in between an unsettled present and an undetermined future.

The plot of the story (if it can be said to have one) is apparent mostly in retrospect, as the death of one of the characters has an impact on the lives of friends and associates. But it's not plot you enjoy in this film. Instead it's the often self-absorbed characters, on whom life's lessons are gradually dawning - we don't always get what we want, and we're not good at anticipating what will make us happy. Attempts to get our lives in order rarely pan out. Relationships to those closest to us are often conflicted by competing desires - or the dying of desire itself. In a way, the film is high-class soap opera, but as it unfolds, it manages to articulate its share of truths. Great cast and believable performances appropriately captured in a kinetic style of cinematography and editing. The DVD includes a brief interview with the director.",1246838400,3,1362,4.870689655172414
7988803,2,B000093FJQ,This is your typical slow evolving character development film that tries to capture a slice of life. More down trodden than up lifting and not really reflective of my life or anybody elses that I know which is typical of most French Films.,1077235200,2,239,4.5813953488372094
