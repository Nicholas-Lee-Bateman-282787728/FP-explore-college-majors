8168338,5,B000MFEEB4,"This is the best video you can buy if your getting a new puppy!  This is the second one I bought. (Gave my first one to a friend years ago)  I'm getting a new puppy and want to watch it again.  Before the video I didn't know you should keep your pup in a cage/kennel.  As they grow they love having their own safe place.  At night my pup automatically heads to his cage.  He loves it.
  Also lots of training tips.  Totally recommend this Puppy Video.",1384387200,,451,4.091954022988506

We purchased a  Puppy Chow video almost 20 years ago and it had recently gotten damaged.

When I saw they were available I bought 3 of them so that she will not ever have to be without one again!!",1376352000,,252,4.340425531914893
