4661694,4,B005DTGAW0,"Robotech: The Macross Saga

A little back story on the series:
Back in the 80's, a company called Harmony Gold decided to import an anime series over to the U.S. None of the series they found were long enough, so they chose 3 shows with similar styles and plots, edited and dubbed them together in a fashion that made them fit, and called the overall series ""Robotech"".
As a whole, I found the series enjoyable, although I'll admit the splicing process wasn't seemless.
As for this product:
This is the Robotech Macross Saga, the first of the 3 sagas.
The plots is about the crew an advanced alien warship, recovered by humans and rebuilt to protect earth. After rebuilding the ship and reverse engineering the technology within it (allowing them to build giant robots), an alien force comes to earth to claim the ship.
The Macross Saga is often considered the best of the 3 sagas (although I personally prefer the 3rd, ""The New Generation"").
The show is consistent with the animation of the time. It does have its light moments, but don't be fooled; just because it's a cartoon doesn't mean it doesn't get series. It deals with war, the effects war has on people, and even the killing of major characters. It also has a far amount of drama. I watched this series as a kid, and enjoyed the action and robot fights. As an adult, I can also appreciate some of the drama as well (albeit, some of it isn't quite my cup of tea).
This set also is going for a pretty reasonable price. I picked this up at a local retailer, and was impressed with both the price, and simply the way the set is packaged. It is a 5 disc set, with each disc set on a page-like holder, so you don't have to pulled out discs just to get to the disc behind it. The case is also the size of a standard DVD case, so if you have DVD holders that are sized for standard cases, this will fit just fine into it.
The episodes have been remastered, including edited the intro with footage specifically from this saga (the original Robotech opening had footage from all 3 sagas), and the picture and audio play great. Although... sometimes the sound effects do drown out the characters talking a bit. Not horrible, but it's there.
Unfortunately, you don't get much else. There are no extras, no making of or commentary. In fact, I found there wasn't even a closed caption option.
I can overlook the lack of the bonus's (this does seem to be a budget set), but I am disappointed with the lack of closed captioning.
But for the price, this is a very good package. I would recomment for fans of sci-fi, action cartoons, or anime.",1349222400,6,2586,4.455696202531645
4661695,1,B005DTGAW0,"Robotech may in fact be the wost show ever made...and fails every time it's released. This is the reality here.

Robotech is not anime: it is a series of 3 anime that were reedited and dubbed, and the actual story material was thrown out and replaced by a storyline that was essentially made up. Since the dialogue has nothing to do with the original dialogue, and the story has only the loosest connection to the the original, this can't be called an anime: you can't have a movie or TV show, and throw out the the actual story and dialogue and just keep the picture.

anime is determinately not ""animation which has been mutilated"". Anime is refers to 'animation' that is produced in japan...since robocrap was NOT produced in japan, it is not anime. Period.

Macross originated in japan, robocrap is pure American schlock.

Actually, the correct argument is that there is really no such thing as Robotech: it's just a name slapped on something which already has a legitimate name. So, since Macross is legitimate, Robotech must be illegitimate.

Robotech was a cheap jack attempt to cash in on a classic anime series, done with horrible rewriting and terrible dubbing. IT'S NOT A CLASSIC. MACROSS is a classic, Robotech is mutilation of a classic. You can't make something great 'better' by ruining it. Macross is considered a classic the world over...Robotech is loved by a few people with arrested development, in some of the english speaking countries.

So why the ROBOTECH fans? Well, the perp responsible for this horror did this at a time where more faithful translation and accurate adaption wasn't available...so it was this or nothing. Carl Macek got away with this merely because he had no competition at all. As soon as there was a choice, he went bankrupt. Macek never 'created' anything, he merely took other people's work and vandalized it. Don't take my word for it: check out his entry in the IMDB. He's considered a purveyor of schlock, and takes credit for works he had nothing to do with creating. That's his actual legacy.

So why bring this zombie back from the dead? Every company that ever re-issued Robotech lost money, because the only people who will buy this are people who are fooled by calling it anime, and Robotech's perplexing fans. Let's face it, Robotech fans are a small group of people who are incapable of perceiving how bad it is. Sorry kids, even though you love it, it's horribly dubbed, and horribly written, as bad as possible in pretty much every way and virtually unwatchable. It's an embarrassment, not only to anime in particular, but to Americans in general: it makes us look bigoted, ignorant, and dumb.

Don't be fooled, don't buy this or anything with 'robotech' on it.",1340150400,2,2722,4.801282051282051
4661696,5,B005DTGAW0,"Completed film updated review (if you guys have questions, feel free and leave a comment...I'll do my best to answer):

ROBOTECH, FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR,...
is the American adaptation of 3 different and independent Japanese anime all produced from the same studio, Tatsunoko Productions.  But Carl Macek worked his magic in the re-adaptation bringing those 3 different series, with cooperation from Tatsunoko Productions,  into both a narratively and visually united 85-episode series spanning the 3 sagas (1 each for the original 3 animes)...which in turn were directly and seamlessly connected to each other.  And this show had a profound effect on American TV
animation.  Besides serving as one of the first mainstream introductions of anime to America, it served a greater purpose.  It raised the bar on what can be expected of animation and animated narratives.  The series, throughout its 85-episode run, was both profound and deep in it's narratives while at the same time dealing with more mature issues of death, love vs infatuation, war, cultural perception & misunderstanding, loss, post war trauma and rebuilding, and other heavy themes in a very smart and well developed manner.  It proved that American animation did not always have to be ""kid's stuff"".  Not many animated shows of the period were so ""mature"" (with some exceptions such as ""Jem and the Holograms"").  In the end, it paved the way for many of our shows and sci-fi we enjoy today.

THIS DVD SET...
contains a complete collection of what we can consider the first season or saga (your choice): 36 episodes.  This is the 1st volume volume out of 3 (technically 4...I'll explain later).  I have just completed watching the entirety of the show  This is a very nostalgic show only for the fact that I remember watching this show as a kid, but not because I remember exactly what I watched.  In fact, I honestly don't remember anything except the explosions.  So in a way I saw it with new eyes that had no strong relation or connection to it.  I must say, I am impressed.  This is the extended version.  What this means is that the episodes were left virtually untouched and unedited.  Many scenes that were taken out for broadcasting were placed back in.  Also, the audio really is much cleaner and clearer...a little strange at first if you still remember the ""roughness"" or the original broadcasts.  I will say, though, that the audio is somewhat unbalanced.  Basically, voiceover volume is a little lower than ambience sounds (ie guns firing, ships blasting off into space, etc)...enough so that it can catch you off guard at time.  They are talking and then BBBBOOOOMMMMM an explosion haha.  But that's really minor and doesn't take away.  The voice acting definitely sounds 80's but many of the voice actors used fit their part and sounded pretty natural, actually...though Lynn Minmei is still annoying as ever...go figure, they even retained that haha.  All 36 episodes are found on the 5 discs contained in this conveniently sized DVD case using the ""flipbook"" method...not disc stacking.  Also, the end is actually very cool and closes well.  Even if you don't get the other 2 volumes, the end could stand on it's own...for obvious reasons stated in the intro above.

SPECIAL FEATURES...
here, I'm just a bit disappointed.  You see, there are none.  However, that can be explained.  I mentioned a 4th volume earlier.  These volumes can either be purchased individually or in the ""complete series"" box set (also sold by Amazon).  I can't say for sure, since i'm opting to go with purchasing individual volumes (it's drastically more economical for me...and I don't need ""extras"" as much), but I believe that 4th volume of the box set holds most if not all the special features.  I also assume that you can, for now, only get that 4th set with the complete box collection.  Still, I will tell you, they pulled all the stops on the special features...there's so much to get if you go with that set.  For your convenience, though, I will list a few of the mentioned features that caught my attention (remember, these features are found in the box set): Music videos (there is a pop idol character...which is why there's tons of music), a ""making of"" documentary, the various original pilots, encyclopedia & bios, ""The Sentinels""(an incomplete season for Robotech that has been re-extended and re-edited under the direction of Carl Macek...this one in particular is nice...because it brings even more closure to the end of the Macross Saga...this volume we are reviewing), more than an hour of deleted scenes, movie supplement, and an avalanche of other stuff I don't have time to list.

FINAL THOUGHTS...
Well, let's start with the obvious, if you want the special features, you'll just have to save up for the complete collection (again, Amazon does sell it).  But if you're like me and special features don't carry as much weight, ""then forget about it...this is New York!"" (sorry, bad joke, but I just remembered the GEICO Gecko-In-New-York commercial haha).  Robotech had a truly powerful influence in the realm of sci-fi, animation media, and storytelling...in fact, I bet that after watching this (and the other 2 volumes) you'll be able to spot a little Robotech in much of the shows we have, now.  It was by no means the perfect series...but, it definitely raised the bar.  Kids will watch it for the explosions and amazing mech combat (beautifully staged, btw), but being much older and re-visiting the story...the narrative had so much depth and class to it...sometimes even very emotional moments.  It could have been a live drama...and I'm not joking, this is a DRAMA more than anything else.  There's something for all ages in this show, even now.  I would say, go out and watch it.  It's simply intelligent work.  Watching it with new and fresh eyes...the narrative and themes were definitely much more profound, heart wrenching, emotional, and touching.  Not bad for animation.",1331942400,26,5978,4.94188376753507
4661697,5,B005DTGAW0,"I saw this at a superstore for $12. For reasonably priced as it was it was on the wish list for years. With christmas money from my father I bought it. There were things I remembered and some things I thought were there but weren't. But let's face it as a kid in the 80's we had more shows to watch more cartoons to watch better shows than todays standards and music too. Anyways , Robotech was one of the first things I remember moving from a small town to a bigget town .We had cable and cartoons and this cameon. I didn't know it at the time that this was anime. The movements, the storytelling the emotions the depth to this was overwhelming then. Since i bought this and watched it allin a week I'm in awe of how wonderful this series is. It still holds up. To the love and soapoperaish triangle to the loss of characters tothe action and battle scenes. If your a kid from the 80's and remember this you need to have this if your new to anime you need to see this it's one of the few that helped shape interests for anime and manga and Japanese pop culture stuff.",1325462400,6,1068,4.164251207729468

4661736,5,B005DTGAW0,"I watched some of Robotech on Cartoon Network's Toonami.  I came in during the second half of the Macross Saga, my first episode being Bursting Point.  I was shocked that people died on this show, so naturally I kept watching it.  And seeing it again, it's better than I remember it for the most part.  It has a well-made dub, & while some of the voices are kind of stilted at times, the good ones are really good (I love hearing some of the voices from Macron 1).  And every character has some personality.  My favorite hero was Max because he was really cool.  My favorite villain was Khyron because he was psycho and that made him a great menace (I also love the fact that his voice is the same as Prince Aharn's in Macron 1).  And the writing more then makes up for any bad acting.  What other 80's or even 90's cartoon had lines like ""Last battle he got drunk & killed some of his own men.""  Like I said, great show, until episode 27, Force of Arms.  It was the best episode in this season, and I sort of wish it had ended there.  But the show continued for another 9 episodes.  As a kid, I thought these were a little boring & completely unnecessary so I gave up after the first 2 (although watching them again the first one is pretty good & the second one is okay).  A pity, as the next 3 episodes were quite good all things considering.  But it's all downhill from there when we get to the last disc.  None of the 4 episodes on it are memorable, but they have moments.  A Rainy Night is good despite the lack of action, but Private Time is the worst episode of the season (apart from the clip shows), Season's Greetings is better but still not fantastic, & while To The Stars is hardly the best season finale I've seen, it was worth it for Khyron's glorious exit.  But it still felt a little rushed, mainly in how they dropped a bridge on some characters offscreen.  However, the worst part of these final episodes was the love triangle.  It's sort of like the Bora & Upa subplot in Dragonball; it was fine while the big bad was around, but with the threat gone it suddenly became frustrating.  But even so, there were 4 great episodes after Force of Arms, which is more than that horrible post Red Ribbon Army Dragonball arc ever had.  I must say that if it ended here I would probably deduct a star, but since it doesn't & what comes next is even better, I'll give it 5.

Just so you know, this is the uncut edition, & while most of the deleted scenes are just violence, there are 3 episodes with nudity in them.  There's Minmei's infamous shower scene in episode 4 (which is used again in the clip show Phantasm), and while not as noticeable there is a topless poster in episode 15.  But apart from these, this is safe for kids to watch.  I really like the back & cover for this, although I wonder why Miriya was chosen over Max.  I know it had to have Rick & Roy, but what about my favorite character?  He was around longer than her.  Ah well, it's a good set, & I'm glad I got it, because I won't ever be owning any of the other sets in this series, as the next 2 seasons feature lots of nudity uncut.  I'll stick with the Legacy Collections thank you very much (& that is what I recommend parents get so that they can show Robotech to their kids & not have to pre-screen every single episode for nudity).
