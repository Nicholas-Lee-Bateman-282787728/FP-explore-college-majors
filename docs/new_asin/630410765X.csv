800348,2,630410765X,"The film had uneven humor throughout and little accuracy in it's portrayal of the phone sex industry.  I am in the phone fantasy business and ""Girl 6"" is largely fantasy.  While callers do indeed have a racial bias and many quirks; offices never are even half that nice and working from home isn't scary.  Although I suppose there are girls who give their personal number out to callers and obsess over their work; most of us are well adjusted educated women with normal homes and families in suburbia who keep a safe distance from our clientel.",1021680000,8,545,4.65625
800349,1,630410765X,"When I saw this movie I was displeased. This is Spike Lee's worst film ever. To the ones that like this film they must have been obsessed with the dirty talk on the phone sex line scenes. Well thats all this movie about, a bad actress who can't get a break in any films, so she resorts to phone sex as a job. And like I said that's all this movie is, Hilarious phone sex talking. Spike lee has had some good movies but this is his worst.  I would have got more entertainment calling a phone sex operator instead of looking at this. As much as I like Spike Lee, sorry to say but the only thing good about the movie is Prince's songs. The movie is a cheesy film that seems interesting but turns out to be a boring film.",997401600,6,717,4.049295774647887
800350,5,630410765X,"I really liked this movie so much that I want to buy my own copy.  I'd heard about the film when it first came out in 1996, but like so many smaller films, if you don't see it right away you miss your chance.  Right away, the Prince soundtrack is wonderful and sets the tone and you hear so many great songs throughout the film.  This movie has great dialogue and is very well written. If that isn't what you like, you will be bored and should go see some mindless action flick.  I can't imagine how anyone would not like this film.  It is my favorite Spike Lee film without a doubt.  There is definitely an ethereal and dreamy quality to the film that I liked very much.  The main character, Lovely or Girl 6, played by Theresa Randle, is stressed and and overworked from too many part time jobs.  The movie is set in and around Manhattan. Lovely is working all the jobs so that she can be free to go on acting auditions.  Her agent gets her a great audition for a film and she believes she is doing fine until the director says he needs her to take off her top so he can look at her breasts.  She is so disgusted by this treatment that she walks out on the audition and she becomes increasingly frustrated at what it seems it will take for her to get a break in the acting field.  While looking at want ads while riding the subway (we see her sick, coughing and exhausted from overwork and stress) she sees an ad that promises great money doing phone sex and she interviews for the job.  The whole process of her inquiring about the job, training for the job and the people she encounters, not to mention the whole ""business"" of phone sex is so entertaining.  There are some great cameos in this film, including Madonna (who is terrific), Naomi Campbell, Richard Belzer and Quentin Tarantino.  Debi Mazor is another phone girl who warns Lovely (Theresa) not to take it all too seriously.  Spike Lee is wonderful as Lovely's neighbor- a dreamer just like her.  He chastises her for doing the ""phone bone"" when she ought to be pursing her acting career, but as Lovely points out, her job actually is acting on a certain level.  There are some touching moments, too such as when Lovely hopes to meet one of her clients in Coney Island and she's waiting for hours and looking for him. There is also a very frightening scene when a sicko (snuff fantasy) client finds out where Lovely lives and wants to make his fantasy a reality. There is a funny side plot about Lovely's ex-husband who steals from local merchants such as fruit vendors.  This ex-husband wants Lovely back and never stops trying. I won't give the rest of the plot away, but if any of this sounds remotely interesting, check out this film. I think that this film was well done in all aspects and I consider it one of my all time favorite films.",995241600,2,2808,4.367307692307692

The cinematography was colorful  and dynamic and  Theresa Randle ( a very beautiful and talented actress who  usually pick out horrible movies to be featured in)was remarkable! She had  the the voice and the spunk to play this character to a ""T""!  Normally, I get tired of watching Spike Lee in his own movies..but he was  perfect as the nerdy, scrubbish Jimmy!

Check out  Madonna as a strip club owner and Quentin Tarrantino as the demanding  director! And to top it off, it had THE BEST SOUNDTRACK any movie could  ever have!  It was brillant for Spike to have the Emperor of sexy music  *yes, I mean Prince* to bless this feature with his sound! I wasn't  surprised to see the Amazonian.com people giving this movie the ratings  that it got. It's definantly not for people who are looking for the usual  controversial Spike Lee movie.

It is good with Erotic City, Nasty Girl, 13 Kickin' tracks, ""Original Soundtrack"", a sad, emotional movie, the part where she went to meet a man she'd talked to, but... she waited, like perhaps he didn't know she was a pretty black woman, doing  what she felt she needed to for income. We often must do things in life we abhor, but must. I judge this movie worth seeing, she was not ""selling her body"" nor spirit, just TCB (Taking Care of Business), so I felt empathy for her Character. This was the best ""Prince"" movie I've seen.

800851,3,630410765X,"Spike Lee's ""Girl 6"" is a strange, open-ended comedy-drama that actually amounts to little more than a tantalizing character study. The film's protagonist, Judy (Theresa Randle), is an out-of-work actress from New York who moonlights as an assembly-line phone sex operator.  After she's dropped by her agent and acting coach, and humiliated in casting calls (she's repeatedly asked, for example, to disrobe before casting directors), Judy joins a group of ""office girls"" who anonymously entertain a motley crew of male callers, indulging their fantasies with steamy sex- or psychological talk while remaining thoroughly disengaged.  Largely young, attractive (the film features a very young Naomi Campbell) and racially diverse, the ladies are resigned to such work because they can't catch a break elsewhere.  At once intriguing and repulsive, this newfound sideline exposes Judy's emotional baggage and sorely tests her self-esteem and fortitude as she longs for a career as a legitimate actress.  ""Girl 6"" is sometimes quite funny, but it's also a none-too-subtle commentary about the (well-known) dearth of meaningful roles and opportunities for Black actors.  Likewise, there are plenty of sign-posts about the corrosive side-effects of the sex trade and, finally, sly, careful-what-you-wish-for insinuations about the pitfalls of mainstream success (Judy's idol is Dorothy Dandridge, who in 1955 became the first Black Actress to be nominated for an Academy Award in a leading role [""Carmen Jones""].  Dandridge died at age 42, penniless, heartbroken and virtually forgotten).  As Judy, Theresa Randle is a jaw-dropping specimen. Her face is at once breathtakingly innocent, fresh and world weary.  She, like the movie itself, leaves us wanting more. ""Girl 6"" is perfectly watchable, but the overall effect is far too sketchy to be compelling.  Spike Lee himself appears as Judy's next-door neighbor and best friend.  Also with Isaiah Washington and memorable cameos by the likes of Quentin Tarrantino, Madonna, Ron Silver and Halle Berry (who, coincidentally, later won acclaim for her 1998 portrayal of Dandridge and subsequently went on to claim an Oscar for Best Actress for ""Monster's Ball"" in 2001).  The film's soundtrack--by turns loopy, dissonant, and furtively sexual--is produced by--who else?--Prince.",1234310400,,2318,5.613180515759312
800852,5,630410765X,"Judy has a life in free-fall.

Her ex-husband is light years from being career-orientated, her best friend is a wannabe sports memorabilia dealer and she has just suffered through a ""job"" interview with a slick-talking movie director who has his eyes on the casting couch more than looking for the next big star. And now her nominal agent is going to be upset that she walked out on this ""big break"" that he set up all for her.

But all that drama is not helping Judy pay the bills and put food on the table. So she decides to answer an employment ad in a newspaper that promises the opportunity to make great cash through work over the telephone.

And this is where Judy (portrayed by Theresa Randle) becomes Girl 6, the phone sex operator. Directed by Spike Lee - with the screenplay by Suzan-Lori Parks - it is an oftentimes funny, but also quite serious and sometimes disturbing look into a woman who truly becomes a number as she tries to chase her dream of an acting career.

The plot goes full-circle, with Judy learning as much about herself as how the game is played on the fringes of the ""entertainment"" industry, along with a demoralizing gaze into the anonymity of life and the manipulation by depersonalizing the individual.

It truly is a look into the emptiness of talk, talk.",1232323200,,1291,4.571428571428571
800853,5,630410765X,"'girl 6' is one of the few spike lee films that i appreciate wholly and in parts.

the first part is suzan-lori parks' screenplay.  there are times when it feels like a goodly portion of the dialogue is being written as the actors speak the lines.  her words are that good.  the situation which her heroine finds herself in is one that any performer has dealt with.  she somehow manages to plunge the depths of human experience and pull herself up to reconnect with her ambitions to become a working actress without compromise.

the second is theresa randle's performance as girl 6.  6 (or judy) has a lot of issues, a great deal of baggage to carry and randle doesn't hold back in revealing any of 6's complexity.  she is vain, she is overly romantic, she is strong and she, as a character, is in great hands with randle.  i can always turn to this film and jump in because randle's performance is that finely crafted and inviting.  a sad postscript is that this fabulous actress hasn't had much to do since this film was released in 1996.

the third is the supporting cast, filled with many recognizable faces such as isiah washington, jenifer lewis, gretchen mol, naomi campbell, richard belzer, madonna, michael imperioli, debi mazar, debra wilson, quentin tarantino, john turturro and lee himself. many of these actors had worked or continue to work with lee on his joints.  the cast is an embarassment of riches and each actor comes through.

the fourth is the soundtrack made up of prince tunes.  lee uses the music well and the songs are some of the best prince recorded, especially 'erotic city', 'how come u don't call me...' and 'nothing compares to u'.  not to mention the sneak-ins of prince-produced classic like 'nasty girl' and 'screams of passion'.

fifth, and i write this gingerly, is the signature use of subplot.  lee uses this device in his films seemingly in an effort to make them longer.  they add little or nothing to the general action nor do they move the films forward with ease.  'girl 6' has one of these subplots and it is only at the last third of the film that is seems that it's affecting the film for the worse.

but for the most part, the visuals are stimulating, and at times poetic, the editing and camerawork are dancelike and not too gimmicky and everything works together in a funny, touching whole that sparks some interesting discussion about sex, women and their bodies when they are in the entertainment industry by choice or design.",1213315200,2,2479,4.668202764976958
800854,3,630410765X,"This movie is almost like a weird dream that you just can't shake. It only drew me in becuase it was so confusing. Blockbuster should put it in the strange but un-true isle.

""Girl 6"" is a very rare movie, because as far as I can think, it's the only miss by the brilliant Spike Lee. It's just such a convoluted mix because the plot is changing and running all around in different places. The lead actress Theresa Randle (Judy) was one minute auditioning for a movie, then working as a phone sex operator and then there's all these scenes about a missing girl from NY (90's ""b-talk show star,"" Rolonda Watts played a newscaster.) None of it made much sense to me. Theresa Randle either tried way too hard or not enough because she just didn't come off as a believable character.

And, it seemed that perhaps Spike had some very subtle messages of social equality. I especially picked this up when Jennifer Lewis (Boss #1, Lil) mouthed to all her girls that unless otherwise told, they were all ""w-h-i-t-e."" But this is again something that wasn't really touched upon throughout the movie.

I did enjoy the soundtrack very much, by Prince. He actually wrote an entire song of CDs just for this movie which are amazing. And the movie also includes lots of cameos: Martin-the-caller was played by Kid Creole and the Coconuts star ~ Coati Mundi, Girl #75 was played by everyone's favorite model who just can't keep her hands to herself ~ Naomi Campbell and everyone's favorite inmaterial girl played Boss #3. And Halle Berry even pops up briefly in a walk-on role as heself.

800996,5,630410765X,"This is one of my very favorite movies. It has an equal mix of humor and seriousness. Theresa Randle is an amazing actress, and she shows this in taking on her various incarnations during the movie.

At the beginning we meet a very beautiful woman who is sure she is meant to be an actor but is very unsure about herself as a woman and a person. A reading with Quentin Tarantino goes awry when she realizes there is nudity involved. She hestitantly goes through with it but quicly runs out. This doesn't bode well with her agent or her acting coach.

Her acting coach sees that she has a long way to go in acting ... and in growing up. She wishes her well as she drops her.

Looking for work, she stumbles upon a phone sex operator job. At first she is unsure about it, and is visibly stunned that not only is there a racial aspect to the job, and to the whole idea of it.

While her co-workers entertain themselves in other ways, to help in getting caught up with the job, Girl 6 doesn't and eventually becomes way too personally involved with clients. The first one is ""Bob Regular.""

During all this, her ex-husband tries to court her, store owners harass her thinking because she is a fantasy operator she's a prostitute as well.

Back to Bob Regular, a meeting is to take place, and she's warned by a friend/co-worker not to get involved, but she does it anyway.

She waits. She waits. She waits some more; puttiing her job on the line as she is late for work.

Finally, a man starts walking towards her; she calls out to him, but he looks at her with indifference and keeps going. Myself and others included feel that this WAS indeed Bob, but because she wasn't white (which is the pre-requisite for the operators's characters to be) he just kept walking. Or, it was just a stranger.

In any case, she is distraught and her plans of acting have been all but forgotten; claiming that she IS acting by being a phone sex operator.

As a result, she keeps working and working and working. Getting burnt out, and finally enforced to take a leave of absence.

She needs to work ... money, or just because she's getting hooked ... she decides to take a job that was previously offered by a character played by Madonna. A ""home girl,"" Girl 6 does the phone sex job at home.

Getting further and further into the job, and giving out her personal number and address to clients is taking over; her friends don't see her, they only hear her.

It isn't until her life is threatened that she realizes she needs to break free and to change her life, and pursue the dream she had before: ACTING.

The film ends with her leaving for Hollywood and reading the same piece that she did at the beginning. Another director asks her to undress, but this time, she is determined to stay true to herself, and after giving an impressive reading, leaves. She is now sure of herself, her abilities and she has grown up and matured, and the audience noticeably sees this.

Theresa Randle does an impressive job in her role as the main character, and we learn to laugh, love, and appreciate this woman. We see her at her weakest, and we see her at her finest.

We only learn her real name at the end of the movie, which has been criticized, but this shows us that not only do we have to learn who she is, but so did she. When she hears her name, she expresses how ""she likes the sound of it."" It took the whole movie for her to truly find herself, and so it is finally complete when we hear it also.

Spike Lee acts in it as her roommate and friend, and does an excellent job doing so, and in directing. He uses various film techniques: colors, parody flashbacks at characters Girl 6 is inspired by, and all these really flesh out the mood or level of severity that the character is in. We are given humor to laugh as the character laughs, and to keep things from getting too morbid, but when he wants us to know things are serious, Lee ensures that we do indeed know that.

Throughout the movie, we also meet a girl through the news on t.v.; a girl who is innocent and sweet, who is injured severely, and we gain a parallel with Girl 6 herself.

Girl 6 watches the news and discovers a young girl has fallen in an elevator shaft and is in critical condition. At this point, she connects with the girl, but so do we soon see that the character really has connected.

The camera moves through the elevator shaft as if we were falling, and this effect continues at different points as Theresa Randle's character begins to fall also.

Eventually, Girl 6 and the girl meet in person which is also a link in recovery and strength.

Again, the type of photography in the movie; the colors, the realism/surrealism changes with the moods and degrees of the main character's development, and this really help to bring out the humor or seriousness of the piece.

Before she leaves for Hollywood, there is a scene where telephones of all shapes and colors fall smashing to the ground. This truly shows that Girl 6 isn't ""Girl 6"" any longer, but a grown woman who has conquered her fears, her addictions, and is ready to face what life has to bring her from then on.

Madonna and other notable actors/celebrities are featured throughout and they add their own distinctive personality to the film.

In conclusion, ""Girl 6"" is a movie is a dark comedy, a serious comedy; a mature movie offering laughter, tears, fear, and joy. It isn't for everyone, but if you're a fan of Theresa Randle, Spike Lee, Madonna, or just want something different ... something that has some weight to it, or some twisted humor, then this is definitely for you.",1175817600,4,5601,4.419825072886297
800997,1,630410765X,"Girl 6 is, to put it bluntly, a mess of baffling proportions.

The stunning and talented Theresa Randle rises as far above the material as she can. But Suzan-Lori Parks' script is implausible as drama and too silly for comedy. And even the great Spike Lee's direction is uncharacteristically amateurish.

More can be said, but after wasting a maddening hour and 45 minutes wading through this disaster, it would be twice as aggravating to invest more than five sentences urging this one be avoided at all costs.",1158364800,,511,4.862068965517241

His films are full of things that make we think and they're guarantee we'll have fun. ""Girl 6"" however doesn't fit this category. It's not bad, actually I liked it, but it's just plain ordinary movie. I liked Theresa Radle performance and Spike Lee himself is also good. A good reason for guys to watch this is the pretty girls and hearing them talk dirty.",1129852800,,459,4.411764705882353
801002,5,630410765X,"Aside from the motion picture ""Do The Right Thing"", directed by Spike Lee, ""Girl 6"", also directed by Spike Lee, has to be my second all time favorite film he has produced. I know it is available on VHS format through CDNOW/AMAZON.COM, but I don't understand how such a great film as this has fallen into the ""video(VHS)void?"" Does anyone out there know if ""Girl 6"" has ever been produced on DVD, and if so, where I could find it?

If not, has anyone out there heard or know if and when there are plans for ""Girl 6"" to be released on DVD? Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.",1121731200,2,592,4.333333333333333
801003,5,630410765X,"1996: Spike Lee directed this movie believe it or not. He wrote the screenplay and performed in the role of the wise, comforting and dreamer neighboor in Lovely's apartment. Theresa Randle of the Bad Boys film, stars as Lovely, or the eponymous Girl 6. When I saw this film, I could not believe it was a Spike Lee film, but his presence in the movie and his signature urban themes are distinctly marked in this movie. The film deals with an aspiring actress who is coaxed into working as a phone sex operator. Despite the good money it pays, it becomes messy and dangerous for her after a client becomes insanely obscessed with her. Her relationship with her (boyfriend ? husband ?) is in jeopardy due to her choice of work. Although clearly this movie attempts to be serious, there are many comic features written into many of the scenes, particularily the sordid, bizarre and outrageous sexual fantasies of the clients. The phone sex scenes that play out between the operators and their clients are hilarious! The ""fantasy sequences"" in which Lovely acts out various roles from television and film are also hilarious. These roles are: Lovely as Dorothy Dandridge in Carmen Jones, as the daughter in the old sitcom The Jeffersons, as Pam Grier's Foxy Brown in 70's exploitation movies and as a 30's or 40's Hollywood Golden Age diva towards the end of the film shot in black and white. Guest stars abound in this witty urban comic drama. Among them Madonna, as a phone sex operator instructor who is giving the girls tips and advice via a monitor, Halle Barry in a brief interview scene, and even Quentin Terentino shows up in the film. I don't know whether to laugh non stop at one of the silliest films ever made by Spike Lee or to wonder at the subtle signficance of its theme. Spike Lee seems to be portraying a strong black woman who undergoes terrible misfortune in a dark and risky business only to give it up in a beautiful scene towards the end when she and her boyfriend/husband kiss and telephones start falling from the sky in slow motion. In Hollywood, she does not give up her morals or dignity and refuses to do a nude sex scene that might be featured in pornpgraphy. It's really a look at Hollywood's love for sex, its classless tastes and its exploitation of women. It might be Spike Lee's greatest film. Just try to look beyond the comedy.",1086480000,12,2358,4.616666666666666
801004,5,630410765X,"One of my favourite films of all time. There's something about Spike Lee's *Girl 6* that's particularly stuck with me. In short, it's about a phone-sex agency and the people that work there. Theresa Randle plays Girl 6 brilliantly as a woman of great strength and tenderness. Like the film itself, very funny, yet painfully gritty. A surprisingly good performance from Naomi Campbell as Girl 75. An excellent cameo from Madonna playing the aging scarlet-woman with too much makeup spouting sexual profanitys - typecast or what! And the cherry-moon on the cake is the ace use of Prince music running through the film... *How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore* (which was a rare track back then), *HouseQuake*, *17 Days* and *Hot Thing* (which plays during Madge's monologue) being the musical highlights, for me. Oh, and Mr Lee himself is pretty good in it too... I really hope he gets around to releasing this on DVD... soon?!",1061942400,5,921,4.872611464968153
