3655589,5,B001JAHQWA,"LONG overdue. High quality transfers. Easy menu navigation. More importantly, MADTV Season 3 see's a proper release so the world can be educated on the similarites between MADTV skits/bits/material and Saturday NIght Live. Not even sure who jacked who, but one of the 2 parties is guilty of using the same material with slightly different character variation. I will buy every season of MADTV because A. Quincy Jones is a top shelf genius artist whom helmed this show B. The material is so ahead of it's time, SNL should be emberassed (and I LOVE SNL). I have a feeling Lorne Michaels would love it if all seasons of MADTV were made mysteriously unavailable (Sorry Lorne). Highly recommended to anyone that is a fan of great comedy. Tears of laughter are sure to ensure in any household. MADTV are underdogs, and they made it. This show will grow in legend and relevance with time & with the release of all the seasons on DVD. Bring on Season 4, the season debut of comedy mastermind Michael McDonald! WHAT! WHAT! Stuart here I come!",1376956800,,1033,4.712707182320442
3655590,5,B001JAHQWA,I bought this for three reasons. 1. It's Mad Tv!!! I love this show!!! I wish it was still on!!! 2. Vancome Lady!!! Nicole Sullivan is the best!!! 3. Ms. SWAN!!! This was the season that brought her her 1st success!!! Love Alex Borstein!!!,1375833600,,239,4.454545454545454
3655591,5,B001JAHQWA,Great show for a good price. Please keep making these on dvd because it is impossible finding the seasons otherwise.,1374796800,,116,4.85
3655592,5,B001JAHQWA,madtv is the best. i am going to get all seasons 1 through 8 and its sad to see madtv is no longer on t.v. i tell you madtv is 100 times better than wackass saturday night live. buy all of madtv seasons-you will not regret it. thanks amazon.,1372550400,,241,3.938775510204082
3655593,5,B001JAHQWA,"This is going to be an ongoing review of this great season. It's the first season for Will Sasso(Kenny Rogers, Paul Timberman,Bill Clinton), Alex Borstein(Ms. Swan),Pat Kilbane(the Spishak man) Aries Spears(Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy), Chris Hogan and Lisa Kushell. I am just past one disk into the season which is about 8 episodes. I've revisited some of my favorite skits this season. So far: the Vancome Lady 'rescues' plane crash victims, Michael Jackson(Phil Lamarr) in a parody of ""G.I. Jane,"" Darlene McBride sings extremely right-wing songs, Prince is disgusted by the Klumps' dinner conversation(parody of ""The Nutty Professor""), Spishak's Super Soaker Impregnator, Ms. Swan witnesses a crime(""He looka like a man.""), Sex Toy Story, and a new type cooking oil which promises 10% less anal leakage. Those are my favorites of what I've watched so far. The video quality is excellent but, as with Season 2 there are no subtitles or closed captions. There are several chapter stops for each episode but there is no menu access to the chapters.",1372464000,10,1046,5.158823529411765
3655594,5,B001JAHQWA,i still gotta get season 1 & 2 but i am a huge fan of mad tv when its 1st started on fox every night at 11pm i hope they keep going till season 14 (:,1366416000,5,149,3.1666666666666665

3655641,4,B001JAHQWA,"My only complaint about this (and season 2, don't own season 4 as of yet) is the lack of special features that season 1 has, like unaired sketches or bloopers. No other complaints though! Love this season and the series as a whole.
Also just as an FYI, I suggest writing to Shout! Factory (the company behind the Mad TV DVDs) on their website and/or their Facebook. Get them to release season 5 & beyond, especially since Mad's 20th anniversary show is coming soon!! Force Shout! to give us what we want, which is more Mad!",1451174400,,523,4.458333333333333

3655698,5,B001JAHQWA,"Everyone who enjoys brilliant sketch comedy should own all available seasons  of MADtv!  Shout Factory has handsomely packaged the to-date-available seasons 2, 3 & 4.
Season 3 brought newcomers Alex Borstein and Will Sasso to the cast of characters.
Their parodies of movies, television programs and political figures are incredible!
Season 4 showed the debut of Mo Collins, and Michael McDonald.
MADtv was so much edgier than SNL. It seems that (at least in recent years)Saturday Night Live is scrambling to find material to fill up it's air time; whereas MADtv's sketches appear to be carefully crafted and fit their castmembers' creative abilities to a tee!",1392508800,4,660,5.216981132075472

3655702,4,B001JAHQWA,"A classic Sketch Comedy Show that tackles many taboo subjects while making you laugh.  MADTV is not for the squeamish or the easily offended.  There is no such thing as political correctness in this show and every issue that is ""made fun of"" is more to make you see just how ridiculous being offended really is.  The 1st Amendment is openly practiced in this show with little bias politically.  (All sides of every issue are made fun of... eventually).  This was one of my favorite Sketch Comedy Shows and I am really glad they are finally releasing it on DVD.",1384387200,,560,4.56
3655703,5,B001JAHQWA,Wow just as funny as I remember as a kid. I remember staying up late with my older brother watching this show on Saturday nights.,1379808000,,129,4.2
3655704,4,B001JAHQWA,Satisfied with my purchase.  Most of the sketches are funny but like that there are so many to choose from.,1378684800,,107,4.35
