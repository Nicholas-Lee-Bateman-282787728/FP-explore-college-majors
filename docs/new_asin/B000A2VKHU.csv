8073081,3,B000A2VKHU,I found out out volume 2 disk two is the same 3 episodes as disk 2 on volume 1. Also this three volume set is missing 8 episodes from its volume. The entire leo the lion is 26 episodes and these three volumes I have only have 18 with three episodes being the same on disk 2 of both volume 1 and 2. I thought I was getting the whole series of this show but I still enjoy it,1487721600,,372,3.721518987341772

8073083,5,B000A2VKHU,"This was a nice movie that I can watch over again.  I would recommend this movie.  I will be looking for more like this.  I will pass this movie down to my grandkids, who may think the Lion King was the first movie about a Lion.  I think the Lion King was based on this movie.  This movie brought back childhood memories that I thought were lost for ever.",1399593600,,355,4.086956521739131
8073084,2,B000A2VKHU,The animation is wonderful...however the sound quality is so bad as to be almost unplayable. This wonderful series deserves better treatment and needs serious work on the sound quality,1398729600,,184,5.379310344827586
8073085,1,B000A2VKHU,"Leo the Lion is a classic anime series; basically it's the second season of Kimba The White Lion. Confusingly, the series has been made available on DVD by more than one company. These DVDs by the Palm Beach company could not possibly have been checked for quality before being released. The sound on each and every episode is unbelievably, horribly distorted. Yes, you can make out the words, but you'll think someone kicked in the speaker in your TV set.

In addition, each episode is shortened by having as much as 5 minutes cut out of it--there is no reason for this in a DVD release.

I don't know why they couldn't have produced a decent product. The English version of this series was dubbed uncut; why are these shortened versions on these DVDs? This classic series certainly deserves better treatment. If you look around the 'net a little, you can find better DVDs of this series.",1130889600,10,889,4.656050955414012
