4844646,5,B005N8KP3Q,"I would highly recommend this series that is a complete story in each episode. Being a British ex-pat I was a little leery of this being a take on ""Coronation Street,"" but, far from it. It deals intelligently with controversial subjects, within an arena of the day to day toil of inhabitants of a Northern English Street. Those rows of terrace houses still exist, as does the ""local"" pub and obsession with ""footie,"" and indulgence in ""booze,"" and tobacco. However, this does not take away from the very human element of this series. Definitely worth the purchase !!",1355529600,5,566,4.785714285714286

4844649,5,B005N8KP3Q,"During the first episode the viewer becomes involved with the characters and the ways that lives can change in an instant. Following episodes are then engrossing because they look at the life of the street from a different person's perspective in each episode.
The structure of the series and the realistic scripts makes The Street's characters engrossing, funny, desperate and pathetic. The trials and tribulations of ordinary life in a British city are portrayed very well.",1329868800,39,475,5.2631578947368425

4844654,3,B005N8KP3Q,"Less than half of the episodes within this series are really worthy watching. Overall this series suffers from the worst trait of British TV and film; the absolute overindulgence in suffering and sorrow. It's as if the writer was tasked with piling as much suffering onto the characters as possible, without pause for even tiny moments of respite or joy. Endlessly bleak and hopeless lives, suffered mostly in silence.
If you find stomping on anthills entertaining, you'll love 2/3's of the episodes of this series. It's a shame really, because the actors involved in 'The Street' are a who's-who of British TV and film, and several episodes are very, very good.

Worth Watching:

Season 1:
The Accident
Stan
Flasher

4844657,5,B005N8KP3Q,"This is a really gritty compilation of stories with well-known British actors.  The screen plays are well-written and does a good job in revealing different types of lives.  I very much enjoy watching and rewatching this dvd series although some of the subject matter is difficult to watch, but well written.

I have watch this series a couple of times and will do so time and time again.  This is how real people live.  Life is not a fairy tale and The Street shows you this. Enjoy and welcome to the real world!",1395619200,,336,3.911764705882353
4844671,2,B005N8KP3Q,"I couldn't even get through the first episode so I donated the series to the library. The character's flaws were way too exaggerated and not interesting. I bought it because I thought; ""how could you go wrong with this great cast"". I found out that it's easy if you have a story line that is boringly over dramatic.

4844673,1,B005N8KP3Q,"I never expected this series to be so depressing.  I had looked forward to seeing interaction amoung people on a particular street but the only two episodes i could stand to watch were terrible and again, depressing.  Some humor or at least one or two happy people would have gone a long way to making this a better program",1393200000,3,323,4.4576271186440675
4844674,5,B005N8KP3Q,I love British TV series and this one was riveting. Each episode focuses on one family on the street. I found the stories surprisingly powerful. The Manchester accent is difficult for Americans but the effort is worth it.,1393113600,,221,4.842105263157895

4844676,5,B005N8KP3Q,I asked for this for Christmas not know it was a series of very separate vignette-style stories of people living on the same street with only brief appearances in each other's lives.  At first I was disappointed that it wasn't more of an ongoing series type of viewing but that was short-lived.  The characters and stories are rich and thought-provoking.  I am genuinely sleeping by 10:30 pm but it was hard to turn this off and I would be up till one am...watching just one more.,1388880000,,480,4.558139534883721
4844677,5,B005N8KP3Q,"I loved this series, the British do a great job on personality types.  There should be more programs like this, that make you think of who you would be in different situations and the repercussions of our actions.",1388275200,7,213,4.605263157894737
4844678,2,B005N8KP3Q,"You absolutely have to have subtitles watching this anywhere outside the UK!  I'm shocked that there are none.  It's a show with high production and great actors, however so far the subject matter is VERY DARK with very few much needed laughs to break up the gloom, as really great shows always have.  The subtitles thing is unforgivable though.",1388102400,11,345,4.813559322033898

4844690,4,B005N8KP3Q,"Get out the kleenex, cuz you're gonna need it with this series of short stories about people who live on the same street in the UK.  Some of the stories are not fit for kids under 18 years old and I would not recommend this for a strict Christian mind, as it can deal with real-life  tramas that are pretty horrific.  My favorite was about the 10 year old kid that accidentally killed a baby and the adult aftermath of dealing with such a childhood.",1381968000,5,449,4.258823529411765

4844692,3,B005N8KP3Q,"I have other British collections and thought this would be good.  It's o.k., but does not hold my attention like others.  I don't know if it's the actors or storyline.  It's a series of short 'stories' of families living on 'The Street',......guess I was expecting it be to one long movie.  To me, there was not cohesiveness between each set.",1378771200,9,342,4.65

4844696,5,B005N8KP3Q,"The Street is, as all the previous reviewers have stated an outstanding drama about Northern English life. If however you would prefer a comedic rather than a dramatic view of Manchester I would like to recommend Early Doors.

This covers much of the same ground as the Street & is in my view just as "" serious "" but gets you where it hurts with laughter.

There are just two series of 6 half hour episodes , first class writing & even better acting.",1373414400,2,450,4.345238095238095
4844697,5,B005N8KP3Q,"This masterful series rivals the most intricate novels for deft writing and vivid narrative, using the medium of film in a remarkable way. The BAFTA Award winning collection was created by writer Jimmy McGovern (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cracker/dp/B001JXPC4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cracker</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lakes/dp/B007WMNB14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lakes</a>). From a seemingly seamy beginning, complex, inter-woven stories build deep explorations of life-issues. Set in Manchester, in northern England, this gritty series may start with a shag and suitcase of sweets, but things quickly progress to serious stuff. The Brits have knack for writing sharp observations of flawed human characters. The slew of actors involved, from Neil Dudgeon, Jim Broadbent, Lee Ingleby, Jane Horrocks, Gina McKee, Liz White, David Bradley, Ruth McCabe, Christine Bottomely, Joanne Froggatt, Timothy Spall, Mark Benton, David Thewlis, Matt Smith, Grace Cassidy, Dean Andrews, and Marshall Lancaster, etc., are some of the best of the best; the U.K. boasts numerous fine, often underrated, actors. Not only are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garibaldi-Biscuits/dp/B003DKT8AC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garibaldi Biscuits</a>&nbsp;in the offing, many of the actors from the superb&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-On-Mars-U-K/dp/B0038M2SAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life On Mars (U.K.)</a>&nbsp;are featured, also set in Manchester.

Great stories peer intimately at a life, its particularities and interconnectedness to other lives; each character's uniqueness touches larger, more universal narratives. ""The Street"" becomes not just a street in Manchester, but a place we all inhabit. There is no escape from decisions, good or bad, consequences return with vengeance and/or redemption; to say this is an engrossing, compelling series is an understatement.

Jim Broadbent, as retiree Stan McDermott, is lost and stuck with a paltry pension. Broadbent swims in his part as only he can. Contemplating suicide with the darkest of humor, he's faced with a priceless, surreal moment with a television that scolds his generation. You can't miss his trip to the looney-bin, where he meets Shaun McGinley as a lunatic Irishman who thinks he's God, and who promises to send Stan a sign. But is he really nuts? Catch the credits for God. Neil Dudgeon as Brian Peterson, a teacher accused of being a flasher, is unforgettable, superb and evocative (episode 3, Season One). Ultimately, who is the betrayer? His wife claims she has never known him, perhaps it is the other way around. Lee Battle, the young, extremely talented actor who plays the blue-streaked Connor Peterson, his son, should have a long career ahead of him. This is a perfect mix of story and medium of delivery. As Brian Peterson gazes out of a taxi window passing street after fogbound street, you understand that each street is full of stories, each person's life with it's moments of drama. Born story-tellers know from a young age that all around them, others are leading their separate, secret lives. ""The Street"" allows us to peer into a portion of this mystery.

In ""Sean and Yvonne,"" Lee Ingleby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter/dp/B00005JMAH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Gently/dp/B009DS3VQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Gently</a>) as Sean O'Neill, and Christine Bottomley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hope-Springs/dp/B003A6C6WG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hope Springs</a>) as his beautiful, battered wife Yvonne drive one of the more harrowing episodes. In a previous story, ""Asylum,"" we understand that Yvonne is as lost and afraid as the Nigerian refugee she connects with and tries to help. Joanne Froggatt&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>&nbsp;is driven, focused perfection as Yvonne's more privileged sister Kerry; as Aunt Kerry, she dives in to aid her niece Leah O'Neill. With heartbreaking sadness, young Danielle Robinson plays Leah, a child witnessing and surviving the destructive evil of her parents' relationship. This is harrowing stuff, yet finely done. Lee Ingelby is coiled, manic, menacing violence, while Christine Bottomley is a revelation; what acting.

David Thewlis (familiar to Harry Potter fans) can't be missed in the aptly named and fiercely engrossing ""Twin,"" where envy, loyalty, love, and dreadful decisions culminate in an honest denouement. In ""Old Flame,"" Timothy Spall (""Harry Potter"" too) is a beleaguered taxi driver whose life crashes due to his foibles. The scene with his wife on the bus, facing breast cancer, is inspired poetry, Shakespearean without being derivative, ""redundant t*ts"" and all; no one does the English language better than this. You just have to see and hear it. In ""Taxi,"" Matt Smith (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B00CK4WQ1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>) faces the horror of being falsely accused and familial treachery; his parents are superbly played by Grace Cassidy and Oliver Stokes. Whilst in lock-up, his father offers sage advice. The story has one of the most satisfying endings ever.

""The Letter"" is a remarkable story about an unlikely but much-needed friendship between a beleaguered, thieving postman (Mark Benton) and a lost kid (Michael Taylor, great young actor)), with Dean Andrews (""Life On Mars"" and sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ashes-to-Ashes/dp/B0041OJ9JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ashes to Ashes</a>) as a kindly colleague. The scene with the doctor saying, on request in really ""plain English,"" to the dissolute, injured postman that ""your back is f****d"" is perfection. Been there!

""The Promise."" There are no words. But I will try; Toby Kebbell is ""Paul Billerton,"" a character who appears so detestable that one wonders what kind of promise he could possibly make that matters. Then we meet a bereaved mother, Jodhi May as ""Jean Lefferty."" And everything wobbles. Written by Jimmy McGovern, directed by David Blair, the performances are beyond description. Michelle Fairly (as Paul's mother) and Mary Jo Randle (""The Lakes""), as Jean's mother, are both superb (as always). Again, another young actor in ""The Street"" is amazing; Kyle Ward as ""young Paul.""

The great Bob Hoskins is the lead in ""Paddy,"" another fable about fate & courage; in ""The Street,"" truth of spirit will out. Liam Cunningham is the menacing bully, Jasmine Franks (""Morse"") is wonderful as Paddy's wife Orla, as is Charlotte Lewis (""The Lakes"") Liam's wife Siobhan. In ""Dee,"" Anna Friel completely is Dee, caught between a surprisingly deep new relationship with Mark (Daneil Mays of ""Ashes to Ashes""); her lovable gingery sons are played with perfection by more supremely talented young actors (Jordan Hill and Sam Lenthall); Mark's parents are the memorable David Bradely (Harry Potter again!) and Barbara Martin as his wife, placed on a horrible pedestal she never wanted to be on. ""Soldiers"" explores scarring within and without, with Nick (Jonas Armstrong) and his friend Vinny (Martin Walsh) deeply damaged by war; Nick's girlfriend ""Gemma"" (luminously played by Emily Beecham) fights to teach him about the real meaning of beauty. ""Polish"" takes another obnoxious character, barking chef Kieran (beautifully and precisely played by Joseph Mawle), and turns preconceptions upside-down; shame hovers like a thick fog of cigarette smoke shrouding Keiran's dreadful decisions. He looses his heart to the lovely Olenka (Julia Krynke delicately allows emotion to ripple across her face). ""Shay"" (Stephen Graham spookily on target) plunges us into the lost world of an alcoholic meeting his ex (Maxine Peake is great) and his impaired but lovely son Otto, exquisitely played by Leon Harrop. The last episode is a tired flatliner, where McGovern shows his tenancy to destroy his characters. Despite this, and grueling conflicts within ""The Street,"" I can't recommend the series highly enough. Each riveting episode is dense, there's no excess or wasted scenes; they feel like feature-length films. All the writers, and the directors (David Blair and Terry McDonough), are the best of the best; the actors must have been thrilled to push the envelope the way they freed them to.

The only caveat is that unfortunately, for those in noisy environments where the telly is hard to hear, or for those hard of hearing, subtitles are not provided.",1367539200,27,8900,6.1775625504439065
