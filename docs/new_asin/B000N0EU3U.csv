I don't know why more people don't know about her because she is a consummate professional with incredible insight and wit.  You'll feel better after simply having watched this DVD.  I did and I'm a VERY harsh critic.  Allen, Tulsa, OK",1187049600,,311,4.310344827586207
8173765,5,B000N0EU3U,"Finally, a great comedy show for families.  I especially liked Teresa Logan's part.  Sometimes you can't get family-safe and hip in one package and Teresa delivers that.  We need more women comics like her!  Molly, Denver, Colorado",1183680000,,231,5.162162162162162
