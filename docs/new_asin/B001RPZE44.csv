3777775,4,B001RPZE44,"As far as the movies and show are concerned, I am a much bigger fan of Pokemon by concept than by execution. I always pictured it being much more like The Goonies. However, you could do a hell of a lot worse than these three. As a 90s kid, it was hard not to get caught up on the whole phenomenon of Pokemon, and it is not hard to see why. The concept itself is very imaginative and offers lots of great opportunities for unique and interesting stories. Sadly, these opportunities were not fully taken advantage of in the movies and show, but that does not stop these three films from being very enjoyable when in the mood for some nice nostalgia.
All three films feature stunning animation and the same creative creatures that made the series popular to begin with. The stories are overall very interesting and do keep the viewer invested, and watching them again really does bring back memories. The only things that really hurt them are narrative flaws like the method behind Ash's resurrection and just how little he actually does in the second film. As much as I enjoy all three, it would be dishonest to deny these flaws. For what they are however, they prove to be a good time. Hopefully sometime in the future another collection of animators can do a re-imagining of these stories to take full advantage of the missed opportunities. Until then, these will suffice just fine. Pop them in and have some fun.",1386720000,2,1413,4.566929133858268

3777779,5,B001RPZE44,"As a Pokemon fan since childhood, I own all three of these movies on VHS tape but had never gotten around to buying them on DVD until now.  Although, as the previous review mentioned, this set makes no improvements to the movies original VHS/DVD formatting (widescreen, HD, etc.), it is a great way to update (or start) your collection at a cheaper price than buying all three individually.  Since I bought them I have been spending my summer reliving all my childhood Pokemon memories (the VHS player broke several years ago).  I am very happy that I bought this product.",1250035200,3,572,4.7
3777780,3,B001RPZE44,"These films are enjoyable for what they are. Each film is appropriate for children and all three of these movies are enjoyable to watch for both young and old. I remember growing up watching the Pokemon series on KidsWB. This was always one of my favorite series to watch and the films are a nice addition to the series. They even work as decent ends to each season.  As a 19 year old male, I'm positive there are others out there who grew up watching Pokemon who will still enjoy this release for nostalgic reasons and also because the films are not really that bad at all. Sure, these movies are definitely not examples of high art... but are they entertaining? That is a matter of opinion, of course, but I believe these to be fine examples of anime films that work well based upon the material presented in the original series - In other words, Yes -- these are entertaining. As long as your a Pokemon fan and do not have the original DVD releases this is a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection. This release offers nothing new from the old DVD releases aside from the obvious: being housed in a smaller package that consists of a regular DVD case (which is much preferred over the annoying 'snapper' cases the original DVD's were packaged in). The first film is presented on Disc 1 in an identical pressing. The second disc is a flipper with the second movie on Side A and the third film on Side B. I wish these were presented in Widescreen but unfortunately the films are presented in a modified aspect ratio that is different from the theatrical exhibition: in other words -- full frame (and not as the film-makers intended). This is to be expected as this is nothing more than a modest rehash of the old releases. Hopefully sometime in the future Warner Bros. can revisit these films to give them the Widescreen treatment they deserve and perhaps even a nice Blu-ray release can coincide (with lossless high definition audio to boot!). One advantage the DVD releases have over the VHS versions is Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (information that I thought might be useful to some of you making the jump to owning these on DVD for the first time).",1239494400,17,2162,4.572164948453608

8338487,1,B001RPZE44,This price is ridiculous. I bought mine for 19 dollars at Walmart when it came out. There is also a blu-Ray version of this coming out soon and it is only 34.99. It is a limited edition too. Why people would buy this garbage deal is beyond me.,1468886400,,243,4.083333333333333

8338490,5,B001RPZE44,"The original cinematic phenomenon to Pokmon franchise and its sequels on two disk.  The first disk contains Pokmon: The First Movie, while the second disk has  Pokmon The Movie 2000 & Pokmon 3: The Movie (you have to flip the disk in order to watch either movie).  I started enjoying the original Pokmon back in October 2012.  Over time, I began enjoying movies from the other series.  However, these movies stand out because they were first released in theaters.  I see the action in these movies as equals to Transformers: The Movie(because I believe future Pokmon movies need Vince Dicola's music).  This DVD is perfect for those who want to clear their DVD shelves without getting rid of their DVDs.",1437523200,,703,4.808333333333334
