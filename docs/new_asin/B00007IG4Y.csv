7976730,5,B00007IG4Y,"""The Signalman"" is a short story by Charles Dickens and was adapted for the BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas which ran between the years 1971 and 1978. This production was telecast in 1976 and is an effectively creepy tale, with the seemingly innocuous words ""Hello, below there!"" that signals (no pun intended) the beginning of a strange and surreal tale. The phrase is uttered by a traveler (Bernard Lloyd) who is out on a walk when he calls down to a signalman whose gaze appears to be transfixed by something at the mouth of the railway tunnel. The traveler finds the signalman (Denholm Elliott in an understated yet thoroughly convincing performance) strangely afraid of him, but when the signalman discovers the traveler is not whom he thought he was, a friendship of sorts develops between the pair and the traveler joins the signalman at his signal box. Over a cup of tea, the traveler concludes that the signalman is a man of some learning but is obviously suffering some level of anxiety over an unnamed trouble.

The story develops slowly but surely, and when the traveler does eventually discover the source of the signalman's anxiety, he tries to help his new friend by providing a rational explanation. Of course, in a ghost story, one knows that not all things can be explained in a rational manner. The performances by both characters are compelling, especially the credible portrayal of the besieged signalman by Elliott. I found the story to be highly atmospheric, and there's a palpable sense of looming danger that permeates the story and is made all the more real by the convincingly creepy soundtrack, especially in the sound of the warning bell.

At around 40 minutes, this is a short dramatization, but the cast and story make this one of the best in the series. It left me with a deep sense of melancholy and yes, horror. Recommended for fans of supernatural stories in the classic tradition.

Here is a list of the episodes in the series:
The Stalls of Barchester (1971) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James
A Warning to the Curious (1972) - adapted from a short story by M.R. James

For those who are unable to find the DVDs of these shows, I would suggest looking for them on Youtube. The collected stories are also available as a DVD set on the UK Amazon website. I do hope they produce a Region One set very soon for those of us living in the United States as I would love to own a set of these remarkable atmospheric and chilling tales of the supernatural.",1349654400,2,2845,4.594488188976378
7976731,5,B00007IG4Y,"The script is virtually verbatim faithful to the original story ""the Signalman"" by Charles Dickens.  Dickens had a flair for telling ghost stories in a charming way.  The acting is outstanding.  There is no music or special effects to assist a weak plot or poor acting.  The actors are terrific and the plot is terrific.  Dickens sympathized with people in humble vocations and here the movie manages to cause one to feel for the signalman who is haunted by a specter.  The specter portends two horrible events, and on the third occasion portends the death of the signalman himself.  It wasn't out of morbid sentiment that Dickens made this his ending, but it serves his heartfelt sentiment for those kind souls who were born into misfortune, were caste into misfortune by evil personages, or, like here, who squandered it through some series of hapless bad choices.  And here is the secret of Dicken's charming storytelling.",1209513600,3,925,4.922580645161291
7976732,5,B00007IG4Y,"Following the Christmas tradition in England, BBC TV produced made-for-TV short films every year 1971 to 1978. `The Signalman,' which is based on Charles Dickens' spooky short story published in 1865, was made in 1976 as the sixth offering of the series usually called `Ghost Stories for Christmas' today.

The 40 minutes stars Denholm Elliot as a signalman who sees and hears strange things in the isolated railway cutting near a tunnel. The signalman tells a strange tale to a traveler (Bernard Lloyd) who befriends him, believing that he is haunted by a ghost or some supernatural presence. What is worse is that the apparition may signify something terrible, could be an omen of some impending danger.

[ADAPTED BY ANDREW DAVIES] Dickens' original is a well-known story, tightly written and still creepy, and writer Andrew Davies, who later works for the 1995 version of hugely successful `Pride and Prejudice' starring Colin Firth and many other films based on classic novels, successfully translates the psychology of this lonely man and the claustrophobic atmosphere of the place onto the screen intact. It is interesting to notice that Davies's script adds some minor details to each event that was also seen in Dickens book. Consequently the episode about a woman in a carriage and the conclusion are more explicitly shown than Dickens, and considering the film's TV origin, these descriptions are pretty shocking.

Supported by strong acting from the two leading actors, `The Signalman' is still impressive and some even say this is the best of the eight episodes of `Ghost Stories for Christmas.' Fans of old-fashioned ghost stories will not be disappointed.

The DVD from Bfi has a bonus, reading of the original text by John Nettleton.",1169337600,4,1748,5.12280701754386
