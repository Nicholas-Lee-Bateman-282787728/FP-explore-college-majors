4290129,5,B0049HOVCS,This movie is awesome for anyone who likes Michael Jordan 16 Hours and 32 minutes is just crazy. I am very excited to watch all of the things on the Blu-Ray and i got it fast! A must buy for any Jordan Or Bulls collectors or fans!,1307750400,,230,3.9148936170212765
4290130,1,B0049HOVCS,Extremely dissappointed. This blu ray dvd doesn't work in New Zealand and the seller didn't bother to tell us that upon purchase! So now we have a dvd sitting on a shelf that we can't watch!,1304294400,,190,4.305555555555555
4290131,4,B0049HOVCS,For the original movies being older I knew the quality wouldn't be the best even tho it was re-formatted to BluRay. For that reason I give it 4 stars. Overall it is great because you get all the Jordan movies in one package. I'm just a bit dissapointed that the re-format didn't do a better job picture quality wise. I own all these movies on VHS and the difference was minimal.,1300752000,,378,4.338028169014085
4290132,4,B0049HOVCS,"I'm sure by now you've seen all the reviews of individuals getting a wee bit ""irate"" over the fact that the content provided is not in HD. As unfortunate as this is, the fact remains that any footage (whether HD or not) is better than none at all.

We are entering a time where the younger generation may not know of the wonders of Michael Jordan, and this should be a crime! What this does, is allows them to be introduced to ""His Airness,"" in a format that many of the younger generation are familiar with (Blu-Ray). True, the picture quality is not at all up to par, and while that would have been fantastic to see all the action in high-definition clarity, that's not really the point. The point is keeping the Jordan Legacy alive (by any means necessary) and keeping up with today's technological formats to allow this footage to prevail through time.

Who knows? Hopeful in the future, another method of transfer video will come along to where this footage can be cleared up somewhat, but until then, it's best not to complain and just be thankful for what is offered.

The nice addition on these discs is being able to observe several memorable games of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in their entirety (and completely commercial free). I have only been able to watch a couple of them so far, but it has been a real ""treat"" to be able to relive some of these moments. Also included however, are documentaries that have been released throughout Michael's Career up until his second retirement.  These are very informative looks at both his early life, progression in basketball, and ultimately, his career in the NBA. Each one of them adds something different; though at certain points subject matter becomes redundant or used multiple times yet it is not big deal.

Ultimately, I am very pleased with this purchase! I actually had the DVD version (of a previous release), and I decided to upgrade (and yes I said ""upgrade""). Let us not forget that blu-ray discs also have other advantages over DVDs than just higher image resolution (such as better protection on discs surfaces). Anyway, you should definitely consider picking this one up (especially if you don't own any of the Ultimate Jordan sets already)! :)",1300492800,2,2225,4.724226804123711
4290133,3,B0049HOVCS,"There was a time in my life where I would watch Come Fly With Me almost daily.
I remember all the moves, the dialog, etc. I tried doing all the moves in the playground right after watching the movie.

Needless to say i was so psyched to hear about this collection coming to Bluray.

I preordered it as soon as I could.

I was a bit disappointed that they would release something like this. There was no improvement from the DVD version. There were even times where you'd see some pixelation on the movies. Very disappointing. It's like watching youtube sometimes. Was the source material really that bad that they couldn't improve on it any more?",1298764800,17,646,4.551724137931035
4290134,5,B0049HOVCS,"I've read the other reviews on this 2011 Ultimate Jordan Blu-Ray DVD set...many people are complaining about the quality of the archival footage in this set and I cannot believe it.  In ANY quality Michael Jordan footage is simply amazing.  We are so fortunate to live in a time where we are able to capture footage (both audio and video) of His Airness.  If he had come along any earlier, we wouldn't have nearly as much video as we do now.

Most of you probably remember the 1st edition of the Ultimate Jordan DVD set, which was released in 2001...then the 2nd edition (20th anniv. edition) came out in 2004.  If there is any indication of how rare those are now, and how tough they are to obtain in decent condition, this 2011 Ultimate Jordan DVD set will be something to treasure for years to come.

This DVD set is the most comprehensive Michael Jordan DVD set ever produced, and on top of that, it's Limited Edition, which makes it a rare collectible, simply because it's Jordan.  As amazing as MJ  was on the basketball court, his legacy and enduring impact off the court will stand the test of time, because what he did on the court was literally unbelievable!  Enjoy these DVD's, you will never see another one like it.",1298678400,2,1228,4.520361990950226
4290135,5,B0049HOVCS,"Well, let me begin by stating all the good about this compilation. The good is that if you are a Jordan fan, like obviously I am, then you are considering purchasing the most comprehensive collection of Jordan moments EVER, and at a very fair to affordable price. I have been a Jordan fan for pretty much all of my life. Now in my latter 20's these moments still bring a childlike exuberance for my childhood hero, this legendary athlete. Furthermore, to those fans of ""the game"" of basketball who will be witnessing MJ for the first time you are especially in for a real treat! Not only is ""Air Jordan's"" most spectacular moments brought back to life in this collection, the moments have been restored in high definition blu-ray quality. Really! We all know about the hype of movies and sports on blu-ray discs, but these moments actually look better SO MUCH BETTER than when they actually took place. Also, all of you long time fans can finally stop worrying so much about trying to preserve your favorite moments on VHS and DVD's. Moreover, this complication includes the following classic moments... (Over 16 hrs and 32 min. of footage!)

Films: ""Come Fly With Me"", ""Michael Jordan's Playground"", ""Airtime"", ""Above and Beyond"", and ""His Airness"".

Games: 1986 Playoffs Game 2: Chicago vs. Boston (Scores 63 Points), 1990 Chicago vs Cleveland (Scores 69 Points), 1993 Finals Game 4: Chicago vs. Phoenix (Scores 55 Points), 1997 Finals Game 5: Chicago vs. Utah (The Flu Game), 1998 Finals Game 6: Chicago vs. Utah (The Sixth Title)

Bonus:
-2009 Hall of Fame Induction Speech
-Slam Dunk Highlights
-Michael's Great 8
-The Making of Michael Jordan's Playground
-And Much More

The only real downside to this collection is that there are not any of his All Star appearances, 1992 Dream Team Olympic Highlights/gold medal ceremony, college games,198 ""Space ""songs/highlights, 1987-88 full slam dunk contests, commercials: Gatorade, Wheaties, Nike shoe commercials, Hanes, Energizer, Ballpark Hotdogs,music video's (of Space Jam or ""Jam"" with Michael Jackson), or even his last game. However, these moments would make GREAT additions for a 25th compilation. Also, the loading screen music sounds rather basic and repetitative. It's a crying shame that potentially the geatest athlete of all-time is represented by some corny ole elevator music...Blah! That's just nasty, and not in a good way,...OOH!

In a few closing words, to date, this is the BEST Michael Jordan compilation yet, if you happen to be a Jordan fan. A LOT of stuff is left out, but I suppose even a little nibble of greatness is better than nothing at all.
Grade: A
An awesome addition for any Jordan fan!!!!!",1297900800,12,2675,5.002247191011236
4290136,4,B0049HOVCS,"I was thinking to buy the Chicago Bull dynasty series, which is sold out everywhere. This is a good alternative; I didn't give it a five because of the video quality is not HD.",1297728000,,176,4.205882352941177
4290137,4,B0049HOVCS,"I see that many people are stating things that are far from truth.  Some are saying it was advertised as 1080p, it wasn't advertised as anything, tho I wish it was (1080p)it is however 1080i like many tv shows on blu-ray are.  So if you can upscale your dvd to 720p then your basically watching the same.

Older stuff from the 80s doesnt look well, stuff from the 90s looks alot better.  So a lot has to do with the technology of filming over the years.

I have the blu-ray and the 3 disc dvd.  Everything from the 3 disc is included its just worded differently on the blu-ray as they combine some of the stuff and just include commas.  ie. Instead of saying Michaels Greatest Assists and Michaels Greatest Dunks, it says stuff like Michaels greatest assists, dunks, shots, etc.  So the verbiage changed, but it has everything from the 3 disc but weak sauce that the only 2 new things is the HOF speech (which is awesome though) and ""the making of"" MJ's playground.  Now if we REALLY want to get technical, there is one thing that isn't included, when you stick the dvd version in a cpu you could play a sampler game made by EA that has MJ in it.  Though because its from 1999, it only works with Windows 95 lol.  So you're not missing anything.

My ony gripe is it could have included more extras, but I guess Image Entertainment couldn't get the rights or licensing for other material.  The IMAX MJ Blu-ray is coming up for release in March and that can add some more MJ on blu, its just thats its only 45 mins long. :(

The picture quality wasn't superb by any means, but probably the best that could have been done with the source material.  What they should have done though is got the license for new material and threw in a bunch of stuff from his last couple seasons where the video quality was better.  (talking about bulls) However, even highlights from the Wizards would have looked even better in Blu due to cameras used etc.  The more the better, alas that wasn't the case.  Nice slip cover though if you like those types of things.

I got info from Hidefninja.com along with my personal info from owning both copies.",1297728000,6,2130,4.40153452685422
4290138,1,B0049HOVCS,"When you buy a BluRay, you expect HD Quality, and not VHS Quality.
Unfortunately, the source material used in this BluRay was probably from VHS and so the quality suffers.
The resolution looks worse than DVD quality (appears more blurry than 720x480) even though the technical
specs on the packaging says 1080p (1920x1080).  This makes sense as the source data is low resolution.
You can re-master VHS a million times and the resolution won't get any higher. As far as content is
concerned, another reviewer correctly stated that this BluRay has less material than the 3-Disc Anniversary
Edition DVD. The only reason to buy this is if you can no longer find the DVD version.",1297555200,40,674,4.860869565217391
4290139,2,B0049HOVCS,"I searched around looking for a good Jordan BD to buy, and I came here. Considering the SD source material I am sure the $39.98 BD is most definitely NOT worth $144.98!! Maybe Amazon should look into it.",1354924800,2,203,4.368421052631579
4290140,5,B0049HOVCS,"I had gotten back into basketball and Jordan with the purchase of NBA 2K11. After playing through all of the Jordan Challenges, I wanted to relive some of his greatest moments. Based on the games that were included on these discs, this was a no brainier. I know the quality for these games aren't the greatest, but it is the original broadcasts. What more could Jordan fans ask for?

If you want something to remember Jordan by, get this. Until something better comes out, this is all you need.",1336521600,,494,4.550561797752809
4290141,5,B0049HOVCS,"Get this limited edition before it disappears for good. Five of Jordan's greatest games in the BEST EVER quality available is all I needed to know.  The games are NOT true HD, but they are old games and were NEVER even in HD.  So I will take what I can get.  And since I attended the Jordan ""flu game"" in the Delta Center in Utah in Game 5 then I am thrilled just to have this available. I am happy to have this in my collection and on my shelf at home. 5 stars.",1333238400,,462,3.893617021276596

4290144,1,B0049HOVCS,"I have seen this on DVD a couple of years ago and it is THE boxset for any Michael Jordan fan. Unfortunately for some reason they have deemed it appropriate to lock it for American blurayplayers. So no go for me. Very sad, very unfortunate.",1323216000,,240,4.355555555555555

4290146,5,B0049HOVCS,"It's quite sad that people are complaining about this collection because I believe this is the most complete collection out on the market. It's quite impossible to turn footage from the late 80's and early 90's into the HD that we expect. But it is better than the original source material, of that I'm sure. This is definitely worth the purchase for any Jordan fans!",1315699200,,367,4.661538461538462
4290147,4,B0049HOVCS,"This DVD IS re-mastered!  But a lot of the old footage wasn't shot in HD, so it will NOT be converted just because this DVD is on a Blu-Ray disc.
The footage that WAS shot in HD, shows in HD.  This is a great DVD with lots of MJ highlights a footage for MJ and just basketball fans all over.
I love the Jill Scott Tribute as well...and the convenient menu navigation is great.  Example: If you're watching a particular scene, instead of stopping what you're
watching to see what you might wanna watch next, press the menu button and the disc menu pops out from the side of the screen so you can see if you wanna watch something else or continue with what you're already watching.  WORTH THE PURCHASE!",1308614400,,700,4.320610687022901

The games were most likely filmed with SVHS format which were used in broadcasting through out that time. Games weren't filmed with actual film or digital format which would make a transfer that you would expect from standard def to hi-def. This is the best you'll get so deal with it.

As for the $175 price tag, I would not have purchased it but I bought it for my dad so we can watch some good old games together.",1369612800,,616,4.442477876106195
