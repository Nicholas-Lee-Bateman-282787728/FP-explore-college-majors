1354176,3,B00004U5TJ,"If you are like me, you are probably too old to watch cartoons as a kid, and to young to watch 'em as an adult :) If you are like me, you really like to watch cartoons nonetheless. From that kind of view I rate this movie. I find the story overall a bit dull, it sometimes simply lacks emotions. However, the movie gets interesting when the bears get to Winkle's store. Personally, I really liked Jack, the Jack-in-the-box who's afraid of the dark. I watched it in Dutch, so I don't know how the English songs and voices are, but the Dutch voices are not too bad. For the little cartoon fans its definatly a good movie, and for the adults its a good movie to see with your kid. For those like me, its worth checking out, but there are better cartoons out there.",1048550400,2,761,4.219178082191781
1354177,1,B00004U5TJ,"I rented this DVD from a video store months ago and it would not play in my DVD player at all.  I noticed some scratches on the disc and assumed that they were the cause; I returned it with a note to the store that the disc needed to be replaced.
Last night I rented a different copy of The Tangerine Bear again from another video store, which had no scratches or fingerprints, etc.  It also refused to play: just as it was with the first DVD, it displayed the ""Artisan"" logo and the ""Family Home Entertainment"" logo, then shut itself down completely and even took the DVD player out of ""play"" mode.
(Our player has played literally hundreds of other DVDs successfully and with no problems whatsoever; only the two separate copies of The Tangerine Bear have ever refused to work.)
I went to the website on the back cover, ""familyhomeent.com"" and clicked on the ""F.H.E."" logo that had displayed on the television screen before the DVD had shut down; the page could not be found.  Clicking on the customer service icon yielded the same error message.  Finally, clicking on the picture for the page dedicated to ""The Tangerine Bear"" led to a completely blank page except for six helpful words: ""Tangerinebear.com is for the tangerine bear[.]""  There was no further information, nowhere to seek help or register a complaint.
When I inquired at the first video store to which I had written the note about the scratched DVD, I was told that they did not have The Tangerine Bear on DVD in stock anymore and that they did not plan to re-stock it in the future.  It seemed that others had experienced the same difficulties.
The Tangerine Bear is a charming book and a wonderful movie, and I think it's sad that it is being distributed in a format that seems so shoddy and by a company with so many problems in communicating with the public.  I hope it is re-released by a different company; until then, I would highly recommend the VHS version.",1040688000,7,1935,4.57514450867052

1354180,5,B00004U5TJ,"My three sons (ages 6,3 and 1) love this story.  The Tangerine Bear is full of thoughtful lessons.  They received this as a Christmas gift, but they watch it year round.  It is more than just a Christmas story.  Children root for the misfit toys and cheer at the end, when the toys figure out that they already have a home.  A MUST SEE.  If you have children (or adults that prefer good wholesome movies) on your gift list, this video is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection",989539200,8,481,4.409090909090909
1354181,5,B00004U5TJ,"My five year old daughter just adores this holiday movie so much - she refused to let me put it away with the rest of the Christmas stuff!  In the story, a little Teddybear gets his smile sewn on upside down by mistake.  Because of this ""factory error"" he is passed up at the department store, ending up instead, at an out-of-the-way second hand store where he meets an interesting assortment of characters!  The Tangerine Bear really is a very cute, heartwarming, and ""watchable"" movie.  Toss in some great messages such as:  ""our differences make us special"" and ""there's no place like home"" and you have the makings of a perfect little kid's movie!  Even as an adult, you can't help but get an ""awwwwww"" sort of feeling when the happy ending comes - no matter how many times you see it (and trust me, I've seen it MANY, MANY TIMES)!  If you were wondering about this movie, well, wonder no more!  It is definitely one worth owning!",980812800,12,934,4.517857142857143

Singer Trisha Yearwood narrates the story and sings two lovely songs; I especially love ""Lookin' For a Place to Belong"".  The animation, from the teddy bear factory to the adventures at Winkle's store, is a visual treat.  Children will definitely love this movie, but it also contains some important messages, such as love, caring, and a sense of family and belonging, for people of all ages.",977097600,10,565,4.84375

1354218,3,B00004U5TJ,"The Tangerine Bear is a movie Ive always seen on store shelves since it came out, and always had some interest in watching, yet I never got to it until today. Something about the cover caught my attention- a little orange bear with a frown, standing in the spotlight while surrounded by other toys. Since it appeared to view online along with other Christmas movies, I threw it in my queue and finally gave it a shot. Sadly, I didn't see anything special about the movie, at least nothing that would make me even think about giving it 5 stars. The story of the Tangerine Bear is cute, but dragged out, and the dumbed down animation really make it feel longer than it is (just over 40 minutes). I get that not everyone is going to be content watching Christmas specials like Rudolph, Frosty and others, but I can think of at least a couple of newer ones that are more memorable than this. That being said, you could do way worse. The Tangerine Bear is just an average Christmas movie.

We open up with a bunch of stuffed bears in a factory being made and shipped off to toy stores. One of the bears gets flipped upside down on the conveyor belt and, as a result, gets an upside down smile when he goes into the machine that puts on smiles. This little bear is the last one left on the shelf when he arrives at a department store, and after no one buys him, hes put on the clearance table. Time passes, and no one buys him even at the discounted price, so hes sent off with other toys that were defective or missing something, and ends up at a local shop owned by an old man who sells all kinds of things. Here he meets a jack in the box who doesnt like going into his box, a mermaid clock who isn't exactly in-style any more, and a cuckoo clock that doesnt cuckoo. The bear is placed in the window, and as the year goes by, his fur begins to change color due to the direct sunlight, and hes then given the nickname Tangie. As if having a frown wasn't bad enough, who is going to want to buy a frowning orange bear? Things look hopeless for Tangie.

Yeah, I get Im one of the few people on here not giving the movie a 5 star rating. The main reason being that theres just nothing all that great about it. This comes off as a basic made for tv Christmas special that had a very small budget. They got people like Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Tom Bosley and Jenna Elfman to provide voice work, but they're just phoning it in. Jonathan has this weird quiet, whispery thing going on and never puts much emotion into his performance, while Tom Bosley does his usual Tom Bosley thing only toned down. Howie Mandel did the best job, actually attempting to talk like a clown for his jack in the box character. The animation varies from passable to downright ugly, even taking a few shortcuts. After about 15 minutes I noticed that there were a lot of times when characters would cover their faces or turn around while talking, with their back turned to the camera, almost confirming that animators didn't want to put in any extra work animating the faces. And I swear Im not trying to be nitpicky but if you look at some of the scenery shots, some of them don't make any sense. One that stuck out right away was a shot of some buildings next to a bridgelike right next to it. As in, if there was even a mild earthquake, theyd topple right down into the water. There were even times when the characters would look a little muddy. The biggest offender of all for me, was the ending. I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, but it had me go what?! out loud when it happened.

There are a couple of good things, although they're pretty generic. The themes of working together, being nice to each other even if someone comes off as mean, and realizing that sometimes what you're looking for is what you already have, are all great. Its just a shame that they're not focused on as much. The majority of the movie is Tangie whispering about how he needs to be bought by someone. Christmas-wise, you don't get much apart from the beginning and end. Nothing all that bad happens in the movie, so theres nothing to worry about for younger kids here. This is a fairly happy movie, even if the main character is constantly frowning, with nearly no problems that last for more than a few seconds. Even the store owner casually brings up possibly not making rent for the month, and it's never touched on again.

There are A LOT of Christmas specials out now, way more than the small handful in the late 80s and early 90s that I had. This one just doesnt stand out to me, and none of the kids in my family has ever mentioned The Tangerine Bear once. Maybe its just the kind of thing I missed out on by not being a kid when it came out. Again, its definitely not terrible, and you could do a lot worse. I still suggest looking around before you decide on buying it without watching it first.",1419120000,2,4874,4.306100217864924

1354266,5,B00004U5TJ,"Great family movie. Especially enjoyable for ages 10 and under. Short enough to keep the attention span of younger kids but long enough to have a ""plot.""",1354665600,,153,4.703703703703703
1354267,3,B00004U5TJ,"My 3 year old son loves this movie!!!!! However after watching it a MILLION times, I noticed one big mistake. When Tangie is the last bear in Kroll's store, they say it it says ""It's Christmas Eve, when people do their last minute shopping."" Then Tangie the bear doesn't get bought and is sent to the discount table. Then him and the other discount items get sent to the small cheaper store called Winkle's. Then some how, they go through Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve again, and the days up to Christmas while the toys wait to be bought.... The movie has Christmas Eve twice!! It doesn't even specify if it was a year later or what. It just jumps from Chrismas Eve, to Thanksgiving, to Christmas Eve again. Lol. I wonder if I have an older version, perhaps they corrected the mistake on newer disks....Anyways...The movie is adorable and my son loves it, but you can tell the writer's didn't do much editing if you really pay attention to the story and what they are saying. (: The Jack in the Box makes the movie so much better, and he puts the life into the movie.",1354579200,,1065,4.466666666666667

1354279,5,B00004U5TJ,A most wonderful movie. It is a tradition in our family. A touching and moving story of a little bear looking for a home and not realizing that he already has the perfect home. It brings me to tears and joy.,1199923200,,207,4.073170731707317
1354280,5,B00004U5TJ,"This is a very cute kid's movie, while at the same time being warmly touching and entertaining to any adults who are obliged to watch it. This is a perfect movie for Christmastime. Reminiscent of the old story ""Cordouroy"" or even a little bit of ""The Velveteen Rabbit"", it will tug at the heartstrings and make kids from one to ninety-two smile with warmth and emotion.

The story follows an adorable little bear at Christmas time who, after not going home with a lucky child, ends up on a discount rack in the big toy store, and then finds himself in a lonely thrift shop in New York city with a few other toys looking for homes. The sun fades him to a unique tangerine color, hence the name ""Tangerine Bear"". He ends up becoming lost in the big city during a snowstorm, followed up of course by the requisite happy ending where he finally finds a home, sure to please your kids during Christmas, as the storyline is that of a Christmas movie.

Much better than you'd expect for the price. I was actually expecting it to be the price of a regular kid's DVD considering that the quality is on par of or exceeding that of most other movies in this genre. I received this movie as a gift for my little girl a few years back, lost it, and just recently ordered the DVD version so she can watch it for Christmas.  As a lover of kid's movies, this is definitely a worthwhile addition to any animated collection.",1134518400,,1406,4.379310344827586
1354281,4,B00004U5TJ,"I did not hear of this movie when it was released and only bought it because I came across it (on DVD) in a local store for $3.99 and figured I couldn't go wrong at that price,  especially with Tom Bosley, David Hyde Pierce and Jonathan Taylor Thomas on board.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I think it has a nice story line, good characters and nice music (good job with narration and songs, courtesy of Trisha Yearwood).  My daughter wanted to watch it over and over and over.  We even made Tangerine Bear cut out cookies that year!  She loved it so much I went back and bought another copy to add to my niece's Christmas gift.  When my niece opened it her mother was astonished, ""How did you know she LOVES this movie, we get it from the library all the time!?"" (We shared the cookies too!)  I bought it for my niece based on my daughter's reaction and it turned out to be a good call.  So from a child's stand point it is fabulous, and this mom is fond of it too.  Don't expect Disney animation, more like Saturday morning cartoons, but I'd pay full price if I hadn't found such a deal.",1101600000,11,1089,4.242718446601942
