The back of the case says it includes hunts from CA, OR, WA, and AK, but there is no Washington hunt. Everything is bad from the camera work to the lame jokes. The sound effects and stupid thought bubbles are ridiculous. It's cheesy in every way. About the dumbest thing I heard was, ""they're a smaller species, and that's what makes it so hard to find them.""
I bought it at Walmart for $10.",1452902400,,487,4.247311827956989

If you want to watch an immature hunter on video and commercials throughout the video, then this is the video for you. Do not expect to learn anything from it> There's no such thing as: ""Learn different hunting techniques, ranging from spot and stalk to using treestands in heavy timber"". Rick gives hunting and hunters a bad name.",1426636800,,416,4.635135135135135
