2062430,2,B00024JAKK,"""Tornado Warning"" is a made for PAX movie intended to capture the attention of the adventurer in all of us.  The premise is that Dr. Jake Arledge (Gerald McRaney, late of ""Jericho"" and ""Deadwood"") is a meteorologist who's created a tornado predicting system.  On his first big trial, a computer coding error made him inaccurate, so his believability is nil.

Enter Mark Scott (Steve Braun) a computer programming and meteorology major at the University of Oklahoma, a former neighbor of Arledge's, who was influenced to go into meteorology by the good doc himself. He figures out the glitch and reprograms the computer. (Note: he also has a major crush on the doc's daughter, Dee)

As a result of the programming, they discover a town about to celebrate their centennial is right in the path of the storm.  Unfortunately, the mayor (played by Joan Van Ark) and the Sheriff (Brown) do not want to believe this.

Oh, did I mention ""Stormchasers?""  Kirt Reid (David Millbern) is running a tour of people paying to see a tornado up close and personal right to this town.

In addition, Dee Mazur (Thea Gill) is a reporter who is also Arledge's estranged daughter.  She's tried to avoid her Dad ever since her Mom was killed in a tornado by her father's hesitation. She's been ordered by her boss to get the story about Arledge once and for all and she's going to do it.

McRaney does his best with the role and I cannot say I have ever seen him in a role that he doesn't shine in.  Gill as his daughter is also fairly convincing.  The interplay between her and Braun was also interesting.

My issue is, having seen tornadoes firsthand from growing up in Tornado Alley, the CGI footage was just that.  Clearly, the researchers didn't look at a lot of the film from the 1999 F5 tornado that took out much of Midwest City, Oklahoma or they would have seen how neatly the storm swept the landscape rather than their piled up effects.

I guess the final coda for this film for us was when the news reporter was wrapping up his coverage of the destruction of Two Rivers and said, ""Only one building was left standing."" Behind him, was a small townscape of buildings still there.

If you're a diehard McRaney film, this movie is one you will want to see.  He does a great job.  If you want to see tornado footage that's more real, watch ""Twister"" or see one of the excellent Weather Channel documentaries about tornadoes.

2062431,5,B00024JAKK,"This PAX original movie has wonderful special effects--some of the tornadoes look like actual tornadoes instead of CGI!  The plot is good as well.  Gerald McRaney (Promised Land) gives an outstanding performance as Jake Arledge, a storm chaser who tries to prove to his estranged daughter (Thea Gill) and nearly everyone else that his tornado warning system really DOES work.

If you're a fan of tornadoes or family movies I highly recommend this!",1135987200,9,447,5.095890410958904
2062432,4,B00024JAKK,"This is a PAX network film about 90 minutes long.  It stars Gerald McRaney (Promised Land, Major Dad and Simon and Simon fame)as a meteorologist (storm chaser) who at the beginning predicts a tornado and it doesn't happen due to a computer snafu.  His daughter is part of a newteam of storm chasers covering the tornadoes.  Enter a young man who helps him discover the computer snafu and presto!!  the warnings in the state of Oklahoma are there for everyone to believe in or not.  There is a city that is celebrating its 100th anniversary where a tornado is to hit on the day of the festivities.  The town mayor is played by TV veteran Joan Van Ark.  Her character is the one flaw in the film because her acting is so bad which is unusual for Van Ark.  Anyhow she convinves the people not to believe in the Tornado warning and that all will go on as scheduled.

This movie is predictable, yet fun to watch.  The acting, with the exception of Joan Van Ark who is really quite terrible (why she chose to do this film is beyond me...) is quite good.  Gerald McRaney is at his solid, stalwart best, as usual.  The girl who plays his daughter is fine and the boy who fixes the computer snafus and becomes McRaney's partner is o.k.  What makes this film palatable are the special effects.  They are really great and the movie is informative as well as to what to do if you are involved in a tornado or one is in your path.  There are some implausible and unbelievable actions by the characters but for the most part, I enjoyed this film immensely.  The DVD quality is fine.  No extras are included.  For PAX entertainment, wholesome family values this film is great to watch.",1121644800,26,1670,4.419672131147541

8022081,5,B00024JAKK,"i chose this 5 star rating, because it was a very good movie.  i was a little confused about the tornadoes :), when they went back up right away like that.  normally when a real tornado starts to form in the sky, it starts to hail really badly, and starts to rain at the same time :).  that is amazing when the person predicts the tornados that are coming in the areas in oklahoma.  the f 4/ f5 tornado did look real, but it didn't last that long when it damaged the roof a little, luckily the people were ok.  that was very weird when the people didn't think that there was no tornado coming at all.  i would of been scared out of my wits if there was a prediction of a tornado coming in the area.  i recommend this tornado movie to everyone, that loves the weather, and studying tornados ^_^.  i like this movie, because i do love studying tornadoes, and it's very interesting, how they predict tornadoes that are on the ground ^_^.",1376784000,2,934,4.237288135593221
