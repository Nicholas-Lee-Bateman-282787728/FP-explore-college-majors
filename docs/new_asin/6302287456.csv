7823583,1,6302287456,"This was a terrible movie.  It had Chuck Connors (the rifleman) and Tracy Scoggins (Babylon 5) in it.  The skiing is awesome, but of course none of the stars actually skied. The dialogue in between will drive you nuts, but a good remote control will solve that problem.  The editing is a little wacked, so as to not keep the movie flowing.  For the most part, kids can watch. There is one flashback scene that makes you think a little more skin will be shown, but its over pretty quick. Make sure to FF past the pre-show ads as there is an Eric Estrada movie about some rambo type priest that is a little bloody with some risque scenes.
Oh ya, look for me in the beginning of the movie.  I'm the bad guy being chased by the cop.
Filmed on location at Loyola Marymount University in the world famous Bird's Nest!",1032307200,,811,4.309210526315789
