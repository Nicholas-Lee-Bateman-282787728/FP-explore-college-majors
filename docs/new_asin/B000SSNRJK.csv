8206770,5,B000SSNRJK,"Presentations were pretty good though not as professional nor as instructional as I had hoped for.  Not really worth the money spent.  Not much more than I already do in my practice.  The Breast massage one should be more entitled PECTORAL Massage, for that's what was focused on more.  Actually they should down play the word ""breast"" in these videos and teachings to overcome the stigmas that the titles refer to.",1468972800,3,415,4.802816901408451
8206771,5,B000SSNRJK,At first I thought ol Meade was a charlatan. But than I tried this on a couple of dates and I'm addicted. I'd rather stay home and do breast massage than go to the movies. Thanks Meade!,1422057600,3,185,4.027027027027027
8206772,5,B000SSNRJK,"As an instructor at a massage therapy school, I have found very little information on the art of breast massage therapy. I wanted a video that was done in a professional, tasteful manner that I could present to the students in my class. This video has been great as a supplement to the course I teach. It is extremely well done- very professional- and covers all the basics of breast massage. I am glad they included a section on ethics of breast massage as this can be a controversial area and one that my students need to be aware of before offering this service in their own massage therapy practice one day. Meade is very detailed in his massage techniques and this educational video helps me show my students how massage therapy can benefit patients with improved posture as well as holistic healing. Excellent video for massage therapist training. Very happy with my purchase as it has become an integral part of my massage therapy training course.",1418947200,6,954,4.718562874251497
8206773,2,B000SSNRJK,It's fine.  I'll show you some stuff on how to do a massage.  Keep your money - rub your hands around your partner a bit.  I'm sure he'll/she'll like it.,1241136000,5,153,4.033333333333333
8206774,5,B000SSNRJK,"This video was ordered for supplementary information.  It covers all the bases in a very professional way.  Techniques are presented well and in a very understandable way.

I highly recommend this DVD as live classes are difficult to find and even harder to participate in due to BYOB requirements.

Sincerely,
GKP",1233792000,8,314,5.098039215686274
8206775,5,B000SSNRJK,"An exellent DVD and recomended to anyone in the massage or medical industry for that matter, who wants to help make a difference in peoples health. The big problem is getting the women over themselves into realizing everyone isn't always after thier body. I am a male but very passionate about massaging and have made a difference to a lot of people.
I used these techniques and others I have learnt from other countries and my clients (those who arn't scared) have felt the benifits, Mike.",1195257600,11,490,4.709302325581396
