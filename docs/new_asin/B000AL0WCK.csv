2389478,4,B000AL0WCK,"I felt the need to point out that this is not some cheap direct-to-video ripoff of ""Shark's Tale"" and ""Finding Nemo."" This movie, correctly titled ""Help! I'm a Fish"" was produced and released in Europe, originally in Danish in 2000 and later in English, in 2001. It has taken it a long time to come to America, and to see it retitled and with such an awful cover makes me cry. I own the British release of this DVD as well as the original soundtrack, and I love them both. I *highly* recommend this film, which is intelligent and emotional and intense in places. I was captivated from beginning to end on my first viewing.",1156982400,19,622,4.417391304347826

2389500,2,B000AL0WCK,"This movie remided me of how great the film ""The incrediable Mr. Limpet"" is.  This is basically the same thing, but a poor copy.  It is about a boy, or in this care two boys and a girl, turning into fish. The rest of the story is about how they try to get the potion  back from the evil fish so they can turn back to humans.  All before the potion makes the evil fish more human and more evil.  This movie has a weak story, jumps all over the place, is filled with sterotypical charaeters and horrible songs. I saw it when i was on a cruise, and basically in the room with the choice  of only three  movie channels which each ran the same 3 movies over and over.",1321228800,,662,4.00763358778626

2389502,5,B000AL0WCK,If you like fish stories this one is really cute for kids. Adventurous & fun. Grand daughter (3 yrs old) watches many times.,1262908800,,124,4.434782608695652
2389503,5,B000AL0WCK,"I rate this 5 stars because both my children loved this movie and couldn't get enough of it. Formulaic but not totally. As the previous reviewer says, it is a Danish creation with poppy songs sung by a Danish girls group in English. Terry Jones is fantasic as a bumble-headed Marine Biologist who develops a potion that accidentally turns a little girl into a fish. The others, her fast-talking, street-wise brother drinks the potion to rescue her, as does their geeky, intelligent cousin. The race is on to get the three of them to safety within 48 hours or they'll be fish forever. Alan Rickman and his thug underling shark are fish who have had a bit of the antidote and have imported a bit of relative human intelligence as well. Rickman's ideas are evil - to develop an authoritarian control over the other fish in the sea by giving them just enough antidote to make them mindless followers of his scheme. The story is funny and touching as the children discover powers outside their own usual personalities that help them reach their goal.

We've all enjoyed this movie over and over again having first seen in London when my oldest viewed it in her Kindergarten class. (Another American child brought it in as a rainy-day activity.) We bought the movie on tape as well as the CD. Now, here in Australia we inadvertently put the movie in storage while shipping the CD with us. Blockbusters has it. Our second child, 3, loves the sound track, as she's commented on the songs a few times and sings along with them, and loves the story as well.",1207180800,,1547,4.605072463768116
2389504,5,B000AL0WCK,"This movie was super, excellant! I wish I had bought it sooner. Alan Rickmans voice is at it's smoothest. A dream to listen to. The songs are catchy, easy to learn and fun!
My grandson (3.75) who loves anything to do with fish and the sea continues to be over-excited during the entire movie, even after a couple months of repeated viewings. He has never been this excited about Finding Nemo, A Shark Tale, or Little Mermaid; and he HAD to watch them to go to sleep for a couple yrs. They just didn't get him involved with the story and songs like this one does. Great fun!",1202515200,4,573,4.314814814814815
2389505,3,B000AL0WCK,"Well, I'd always wanted to see this, but as I live in America...

So, I bought the DVD. It was interesting, kind of cute. The songs/music were strange to me. I don't know if it's a cultural difference or what, but it just wasn't my kind of music. Alan Rickman is great as Joe (the whole reason I wanted this movie), and surprisingly, his song was the only one I liked. I also would have sworn that Aqua sings the final song, but apparently I'm wrong.

This film is good for people of all ages, and if you like cartoons, you'll probably like this one.",1197331200,,550,4.228571428571429
2389506,5,B000AL0WCK,"My almost-2yr old son doesn't sit still for much. Except for this movie!

I rented it because Alan Rickman is in it & I've been going through an Alan Rickman phase, but I've kept it through Netflix for about 6wks so I really need to buy it already!

At first, it seemed a little cheesy [as a lot of Disney, etc tend to be] but the more I watch it, the more I like it. I think I've probably watched it with my son about 20 times.

I especially like the little girl in it who finds a seahorse & names her ""Sasha"". It's such a nice moment between my son & I. Even if we're not watching the movie, all I have to do is say ""Hi, Sasha"" & he giggles.

Anything to put a smile on my son's face & sit still for a few minutes of snuggling is appreciated.",1193011200,3,744,3.875
2389507,5,B000AL0WCK,This is an incredible film for kids.  It is a Danish creation.  I was thrilled when I could get in the UK in English.  Only wish it was a little easier to purchase in English in the US and Canada in their format.  It is a very sweet story and the music is great.,1190851200,,262,3.7962962962962963
2389508,5,B000AL0WCK,"This movie is a hidden treasure.  The packaging and the lack of extra content on the DVD make this look like it is going to be another cheap kiddie cartoon with a low budget and no production values.

Then you start the movie, and it blows you away!  This movie is every bit as good as most of the Disney movies we own, and significantly better than the Disney direct-to-DVD movies.  My daughters love it, my youngest sings along to the songs, and it is one of those rare movies that I don't mind sitting down and watching with them.

The music is, for the most part, very different than you'll find in most kid-targeted movies, and surprisingly good.  The story is fun, the animation top-notch.

This is one that my kids have watched over and over again, and I highly recommend it for your video library if you have younger children.",1176508800,13,834,4.447368421052632

It's a great movie about a few kids who accidentally get turned into fish.  Alan Rickman is excellent as always, the music is fun, and the child actors are not annoying.

8078752,5,B000AL0WCK,"Don't let the ugly CGI cover fool you. This film is not another CGI knock-off you see crop up every time a popular movie is release.

This film is honestly one of my favorite children's films of all time. The plot, the music, the visuals, everything. Only fault would be that the film, despite being made in the 2000s, looks like it was made in the 90s but that's a fault that doesn't bother me. The plot, since there doesn't seem to be a plot listed in the description is this:

Fly, his toddler sister Stella, and his cousin Chuck go out fishing and stumble upon the home of a cooky scientist who had created a potion that can turn you into a fish. It's permanent unless you drink the antidote within 48 hours. Stella drinks the potion, thinking it's lemonade, and is transformed. Fly, thinking she's a fish, throws her out the window and into the ocean. Fly, Chuck, and the scientist go out to sea to find her. Storm hits. Their boat is destroyed. Fly and Chuck turn into fish to survive and find Stella. Scientist and the antidote go missing. Now, the three fish must find the antidote before their 48 hours are up. Meanwhile, a fish named Joe (voiced by Alan Rickman) and a shark have swallowed some of the antidote, giving them human intelligence and the fish decides to use the potion to take over the entire sea. So our heroes must get the potion from Joe and his armies or find a new way back to being human and to getting home. Another thing I liked about the film was the fact that the main character's parents are active in the film. So you get to see something that usually doesn't happen in most kids films where the kids sneak out to go have an adventure: parents panicking and searching for their kids.

Highly recommend!",1458432000,2,1737,4.404984423676012

8078754,5,B000AL0WCK,"This movie is BY FAR my favorite film of all time.

I stumbled upon it last October while I was browsing the tag of another older movie on Tumblr. When I saw the poster, I was instantly intrigued. I had to find out what this movie was, what exactly it was about.

Sadly, because it's so bizarrely obscure, especially to those of us on the USA, I had a hard time finding a place to watch it. It took me an entire day to find it and I had to use the US title ""A Fish Tale"" to do so.

After watching it, I was absolutely shocked that I'd never seen or heard of this movie before. Being an animator, it's appalling to find a movie that is so high in quality but was never been mentioned to you in your 23-year-old lifetime. When I talked to my animation teachers about it, they'd never seen or heard of it either.

I seriously wish I had known about it much sooner. In fact, I'm incredibly jealous of those who got to see it in the theater when it was brand new. But that never happened here, it didn't have the chance to grace US theaters (as far as I know). For 5-6 years, there wasn't even an NTSC DVD. Then, in 2006, some US folks decided they'd put it out under the title ""A Fish Tale"". Now maybe I wouldn't be so sore about the name change if the cover art didn't make the film look like a mockbuster of A Shark Tale/Finding Nemo (FYI this movie was made before either of those). And, on top of that, the US DVD's overall quality is so poor, I'd say that it's worth buying a region-free DVD player and the PAL/Region 2 DVD to watch it in it's intended glory. And to get the great special features too because the US version doesn't have any of those on it either. It's disgusting that the US distributors would totally disrespect such an amazing film...

This movie deserves so much more than that.

Animation-wise, it's a gorgeous film! While some of the movements and inbetweens can be a little wonky from time to time, the overall flow of the characters is astounding! They put a lot of thought and work into the body language of each individual.

The backgrounds are all beautiful and so pleasant to look at. Their composition and occasional simplicity are works of genius. They definitely got the right guys to paint the most joyful, colorful, whimsical backgrounds you'll ever see.

Each character design is practically flawless and they break several tropes that aren't easy to get around. I'm extremely proud of the creative team on that. If you don't think they're good judging by the cover, please watch this movie to find out exactly why they look the way they do. Trust me, I was also skeptical when I first saw the main characters before watching it but I regret doing so. These children, their parents, and their enemies are amazing. And not just by design, either.

Every character has such a charming personality to them. I don't think there's a single character I hate. Their dynamics clash and flow in all the right ways. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say much more on that. Please do yourself the favor of watching it. You won't regret it.
But there is one thing I want to mention up front: I absolutely adore the fact that Chuck, Fly's cousin, has his personality define him, not his body type. There is never a moment where Chuck is called ""fat"" or ""large"". Hell, our attention isn't even brought to the fact that he's a bigger kid passed his character design. Fly and Stella never talk about it, not even the villains do. As far as I know, there's no other movie that does that and I wish more did.

Story is where the movie has the most flaws, mostly with its timing. But even with it's flaws, there are so many things that make sense you almost forget about them. It's swerves and twists are very well thought out and will have you on the edge of your seat. Not to mention there's a lot of details that won't make sense or seem silly at first but this particular movie is the embodiment of ""what goes around comes around"". Everything has a reason for happening or appearing.

On that topic, yes, there are songs in this movie that characters sing. But unlike most movies, there are reasons for those two songs to be sung. But you'll have to figure out why on your own. ;)
Other than those two musical numbers, the rest of the soundtrack is great! Not perfect, but I can get down with most of the jams in the movie and it's OST.

If you love animated movies, charming stories, amazing characters, and cute music, this is your film! If you're an animator looking for an inspiring movie to watch, this is your film! As a matter of fact, I think everyone should give this movie at least one chance.

If you can't get your hands on a region-free DVD player, I'm sure there are places that will allow you to rent it online. And if you love the movie after that, please buy it/share it with your friends. At least for the creators' sakes, their hard work needs all the recognition it can get.",1433462400,,4923,4.355507088331516

I completely disagree!!! Then again I guess I cant take it too much to heart because the very next day he looked at me and ordered me to put in the fish movie that I was watching last night!

Apparently I am too old to watch myself but not to watch with him... The movie had us both singing and he was dancing like crazy!!! Like I said AMAZING FOR ALL AGES!",1366070400,,613,3.857142857142857
