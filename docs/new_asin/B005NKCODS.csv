4847834,5,B005NKCODS,"The movie is well done and provides a picture of Anderson Fair and many of the musicians that have performed there/got their start there over the years. It was always a great place to see live music in an intimate setting where people listened - I spent many nights there in the mid to late 70s listening, learning - the movie does it outstanding job of catching the vide of this seminal Houston/Mintrose landmark - makes me want to place an order of their nachos and beer...",1393372800,,475,4.471264367816092
4847835,5,B005NKCODS,"What do Lyle Lovett, Nanci Griffith, Robert Earl Keen, Guy Clark, Lucinda Williams and Townes Van Zant have in common - besides being stars of the ""Americana Music"" scene? Well they all got their first stage appearance in a small 80-seat coffee house in the Montrose section of Houston, TX called the Anderson Fair Retail Restaurant. (It was originally a restaurant and, I'm told, it still has food but it's mostly a performance venue now passing 43 years. It's still run by an all-volunteer staff.

I discovered this wonderful 90-minute documentary - produced in 2010- while working on some reviews of the  new book and CD-set on Caffe Lena - the legendary Saratoga Springs, NY coffee house. (There was a PBS documentary about Caffe Lena but it has never been released on DVD due to the high cost of music rights.) Like way too many others outside of Texas, I was never aware of Anderson Fair (named after the last names of the two people who founded it.). Director Bruce Bryant was able to get contemporary interviews with all the artists above (at least those still living) and someone had a large amount of archival video - mostly sharp black and white - of early performances by Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Guy Clark, Dave Van Ronk, Lucinda and Van Zandt. (The title for the film comes from a Van Zant song.)  There were also many locals who played the venue, but never made the ""big time"".  They are given their place in the film as well.

Some of the stories reveal new sides to the well-known performers. Lyle Lovett tells how he was in college when he visited the club and wrote a story about it for the college newspaper, years before he played his first note on the AF stage.  He and Keen were actually in the same graduating class at Texas A&M (Class of 1979).
While there are many performances shown - both the archival and newly filmed - nearly all are only ""samples"", and not full performances. Of course, if all these were included complete the documentary would be as long as ""Woodstock"". Still, it would have been extra special if those songs were included as bonus features. As it is, there are no bonuses; just the film and a ""scene selection"" option.

If you are interested in any of the artists noted above or a fan of Americana music, I think you'll want to seek this film out.  It's great that director Bryant captured the history of the venue and - through screenings at film festivals and via the DVD - the world will know the story of Anderson Fair.

I hope you found this Review both informative and helpful.

4847836,5,B005NKCODS,"Being an avid music lover, I was dismayed that the story of ANDERSON FAIR was lost to me all these years. A friend turned me on to this great ""lost"" story of American songwriters in the late '60's, 70's  and today. Lyle Lovett, Steven Fromholz, Lucinda Williams and all make you long for the innocence of our youth.",1358294400,4,315,4.431034482758621
4847837,5,B005NKCODS,Anderson Fair is a great Venue for experiencing the Texas Music scene.  It's nice that all of these musicians and key people got together to share the music and history of a place we frequent.,1356048000,3,192,4.485714285714286
4847838,4,B005NKCODS,"Beautifully shot & realized, ""For The Sake Of The Song"" is a terrific documentary covering the storied history of Anderson Fair Retail Restaurant, and the singer-songwriters who've performed there. Going from old footage shot at the venue back in the 1970s, to present-day performances by the same musicians, one sees how these artists crafted their sound & persona. Some ""talking head"" interviews add depth. One gets not only the background of how these musicians evolved, but of how Anderson Fair actually helped them to nurture their careers. Some of those covered here include Lyle Lovett, Guy Clark, Nanci Griffith, Lucinda Williams, Robert Earl Keen, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Townes Van Zandt, Adrian Legg, Carolyn Hester, Vince Bell, Shake Russell, Denice Franke, John Vandiver, and more. A veritable who's who of the genre. Anderson Fair is small place that had a big impact on music not only in Houston, but throughout the national music scene. The hi-def images are excellent. Very much recommended to those who are fans of the singer-songwriter genre, Texas music, or just documentaries in general.",1344211200,9,1107,5.259887005649717
8480552,5,B005NKCODS,"I remember as a kid in Montrose that Anderson Fair was one of the coolest places around.  Tons of hippies, good friends, great block parties made this place special.  Granted, I was too young to see the musicians in the documentary, but I know all of them now.

The Pagen Church was just around the corner...if you know that place, give this review a thumbs up.  LOL.",1520640000,,367,4.432835820895522

If you don't know what it's like to be a starving artist this movie will show you what it's like to love something so much it hurts.
This is must for any music lover !!",1463616000,,329,3.823529411764706
8480557,4,B005NKCODS,"The video is interesting, because it gives a detailed history of this old restaurant that became a hangout for young singers/songwriters. It's not by accident that people of similar interests hang out together. I appreciated the facts about this music Mecca, but I'd have also liked more actual music. But the video was well worth watching.",1463529600,,340,5.089285714285714

8480559,5,B005NKCODS,"This is a very fulfilling and well-made historical documentary about a legendary music spot in Houston, Texas. While Austin was in many ways a focal point of the Texas music scene, an awful lot of good people started out at Anderson Fair, including the mighty Nanci Griffith and Lucinda Williams.

Perhaps the most remarkable thing about AF is its sheer longevity, and the fact that it is still going strong in 2014, having been started in 1970 by partners Marvin Anderson and Gray Fair. Classic Austin venues such as the Vulcan Gas Company and Armadillo World Headquarters are now sadly long gone.

The interviews are a joy to watch, as they not only include a large number of performers, but also many of the Fair's staff and volunteers over the years, including that ""tall blonde dictator"" (Nanci Griffith) Tim Leatherwood.

The only thing I could have asked for in addition would have been a few complete performances from some of the greats, but I guess the focus was on the place itself and how everything evolved. There was a tantalizing piece of footage of Nanci doing 'Red Brick Floor', but alas it then cut to an interview. For Nanci fans, I highly recommend the DVD version of the stunning 'One Fair Summer Evening', which was recorded/filmed at Anderson Fair.

Outstanding",1400198400,5,1284,4.822727272727272
