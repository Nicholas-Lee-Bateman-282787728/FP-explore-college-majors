5751108,1,B00CX7TOOG,Poorly rendered vehicle for man v. man conflict.  De Niro a not very compelling and quite contrived and superficial character. Travolta with an unfortunate accent that makes the hope of hearing any message in the strained dialogue impossible. Give it a miss.,1374796800,6,258,5.142857142857143
5751109,5,B00CX7TOOG,"Didn't expect much going into this movie considering all the bad word of mouth coming from cynical critics, but I was surprised by quite a few strong aspects to this movie. First, this is an amazing script. I would love to sit and read this script by a fire. The dialogue is outstanding, the meditations on war feel more real than most films and Killing Season never dumbs itself down to just another action movie.
There were quite a few set ups in the movie where I winced and quite a few exchanges between DeNiro and Travolta that brought me into the movie completely. Don't believe all the jokes about the bad accents. There's a reason the accents are the way that they are if you actually pay attention to the movie.
Killing Season is a fantastic film with a strong script, strong dialogue, a lot to say and beautiful scenery. Kudos to everyone involved especially the director, Mark Steven Johnson, and the writer, Evan Daugherty. Great film. Highly recommended.

5751110,5,B00CX7TOOG,"I love these 2 actors and felt they both worked well together.  I even thought Travolta did a good job conveying a Serbian contrary to what some others have written.  But then again, I am not rehearsed in knowing how a Serbian talks english. Just a well acted movie with right amount of suspense.  It does make you think after seeing it.",1374624000,2,337,4.403225806451613
5751111,4,B00CX7TOOG,"IT WAS PRETTY GOOD MOVIE. YOU HAVE A RETIRED CAPTAIN THAT TOOK PART IN THE BALKAN WAR AS PART OF A NATO INTERVENTION WHEN SERBIA, STARTED TAKING OVER BOSNIA, CROATIA AS THE COUNTRY OF YUGOSLAVIA, STARTED DISOLVING AND CIVIL WAR BEGAN AS SOON AS THE STRONG MAN TITO DIED AFTER SO MANY YEARS IN POWER RULING.  YOU GET TO SEE SOME GRUSOME SCENES AT TIMES, NOT MUCH,  WHEN DE NIRO'S FLASHES BACK AND IT TAKES YOU TO THE TIME OF ETHNIC CLEANSING SERBIANS WERE DOING, BUT THEY DON'T SHOW MUCH OF IT, LIKE IN ""SCHINDLER'S LIST"" ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST!.
THEN YOU HAVE TRAVOLTA WHO AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF SEARCHING AFTER HE WAS HURT WHEN HE WAS PART OF A GROUP OF MEN THAT NATO SOLDIERS LINED UP TO SHOOT IN BACK OF THE HEAD AND DE NIRO WAS PART OF THEM, BUT COULD NOT GO THRU WITH IT, SO ENDS UP SHOOTING HIM, BUT NOT DEAD. TRAVOLTA SPENDS MOST OF HIS LIFE SEARCHING FOR DE NIRO AND TRAVELS TO AMERICA, WHERE HE'S LOOKING FOR REVENGE OF HIS FAMILY GETTING KILLED DURING THE WAR, SO WANTED A GAME A CAT AND MOUSE WITH DE NIRO IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE DE NIRO HAD RETIRED TO. TRAVOLTA TRIES TO DO A PRETTY GOOD ACCENT THRU THE MOVIE AND I THINK HE MIGHT HAVE SUCCEEDED WITH IT AS I COULD NOT REALLY TELL HOW THEY TALK ANYWAY. THERE WAS A GOOD SCRIPT AND DIRECTION AS WELL OF COURSE AS GOOD ACTING FROM THE BOTH OF THEM. NOT SO MUCH OF A BIG CAST, MOVIE IS MOSTLY THEM TWO AND SOME SUPPORTING ACTING AS DE NIRO'S SON AND HIS WIFE THAT HAD A BABY BUT DE NIRO HAD NOT YET MET, DUE TO HIS DISTANCING FROM THEM FOR MANY YEARS AND CONTINUAL REFUSAL TO SEE THEM, PART THAT WAS NOT EXPLAINED WELL ENOUGH, OTHER THAN HIS GUILT FOR BEING PART OF NATO DURING THAT WAR AND ASHAMED OF THINGS THEY ASKED HIM TO DO AND THE KILLING HE SAW ALL THOSE YEARS!  DO NOT REMEMBER THIS FILM MAKING IT TO THE VIEWING AUDIENCE IN THATRRES AND IF IT DID, IT WASN'T IN MANY CITIES. COMES OUT AT THE END OF AUGUST SOMETIMES, AVAILABLE FOR RENTAL ONLY NOW.

5751113,4,B00CX7TOOG,"I was SO surprised by this movie.  The acting was very good, the scenery was beautiful and the story was such that it really made you think afterwords.  Not because it was confusing, but because of the moral implications, etc.  I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone.  Some of the fight scenes are a bit graphic, so just be aware.",1374451200,53,337,4.475409836065574
5751114,3,B00CX7TOOG,"The film opens in 1992 with a young De Niro shooting a young Bosnian POW in the back. 18 years later Travolta with painted on hair and a bad accent is out for revenge. De Niro has become a mountain man and near hermit. The movie digresses from the expected man hunt to a cripple fight. It tosses in a few seemingly meaningless words on war and life in order to try to make a point.

Travolta was not convincing in his role. De Niro had a few good scenes but mostly was going through the motions. There are better films of this kind out there. Even one with Steve Austin.

Makes for an okay action film rental if you can get beyond the Travolta look and accent. Some apparent CG special effects.

5751115,4,B00CX7TOOG,"When two powerful actors of our time star in a movie, there is no doubt that you have to watch it.

5751122,1,B00CX7TOOG,"I agree with 1-star review by A. Brogden [Jan 2014]. This is about 2 guys - one much older than the other - who torture each other to the point of death over the much overworked Hollywood guilt & revenge catharsis theme. So - predictably of course - at the end of the movie Revolta begs to be shot, Deniro relents and they sit together in the mountains basking in some existential moment of love & bonding that defies anyone's understanding except maybe the screen writer. Revolta's Serbian accent is hilarious while simultaneously distracting & difficult to understand. He's also a little on the fat tum-tum side for all the supposed athletic exertion he displays - bit unbelievable. His supposed accuracy with a single string bow at 40-50 yards with arrow placement into Deniros calf muscle is pure fantasy. Deniro's acting is replete with obviously contrived pain ""fakes"". Deniro can of course offset his decrepit age disadvantage with Revolta by using his amazing McGyver skills; and probably build a BMW in the woods using only pine boughs and piano wire. Who knows: they are both single characters in this movie - maybe they will end up moving in together. There are much better movies of this genre with similar plot. Avoid this one.",1473638400,,1240,4.826291079812207

5751127,5,B00CX7TOOG,"Well THIS is certainly different for both Robert De Niro and especially John Travolta!  I've never seen John in *anything* like this before.  John plays the bad guy here- a former Serbian soldier who pretends to be a drifter just travelling near Robert's house in the woods somewhere in the Appalachian mountains, but is actually secretly planning to hunt Robert down due to being assigned to do so based on the fact Robert was a US veteran who placed Bosnians on their knees before violently shooting them in the back of the head in the early 90's.  Really graphic scene.

This movie is based on the real war that occurred in Bosnia from 1992 through 1995 as they declared independence from Yugoslovia, but whether there were actually two men -an American and a Bosnian- who were at odds that resulted in a game of hunting each other similiar to the story we see in this movie is something I don't know, but I'm going to guess and say Killing Season is taking a real moment of history (the Bosnian war) and wrapping it around a fictional story (you know, typical Hollywood exaggeration).  Anyway, apparently this movie is taking place in the present time with bad blood and memories between John and Robert's time in the war.

Killing Season is a GREAT suspense!  While Robert's about to tell John a joke over the phone while the two are out hunting together, suddenly an arrow comes shooting across the field and nearly hits Robert in the face.  What the?  Who shot it?  It was John!  He suckered Robert into this game of cat and mouse.  Robert, who walks with pain and a limp due to shrapnel, suddenly finds himself running and hiding as best he can.  Eventually Robert makes his own bow and arrow and... WOW, what a shot!  It's really gruesome and I won't spoil it. Let's just say John gets what's coming to him.  Take that Mr. Talkative!

Basically the two trade turns the whole movie.  For a while John gets the upperhand and hunts/tortures Robert, then things change so Robert is doing the torturing (want some salt John?  A whole container of it for that sore mouth maybe?) so expect plenty of arrow shooting, rocks-to-the-face smashing, car wrecking, gun blasting, upside down hangin' misadventures.  Uh, I'm making this seem like it's a comedy.  It's not I promise.  It's a very good suspense.

The biggest problem with this movie is that John Travolta's accent is hard to understand.  I'm not sure if he's speaking proper Bosnian or exaggerating the way Bosnians speak, but either way he's incredibly difficult to understand.  He mumbles so much that the volume button has to go way up high to enjoy this movie.  Because of his heavy accent, it's hard to understand how John was specifically involved in the war.  I know Robert's role- he shoot Bosnians, but it's unclear how John was involved.  Not sure if Robert and John actually knew each other personally during the war or were just two men who happened to be involved in it.

It's just strange how Robert accepts John into his house, they eat dinner together because Robert doesn't want John to be outside in the pouring down rain, and John turns on him so suddenly!  I highly recommend this movie.  Oh and the ending is amazing!  I did NOT see that coming!  I really want to spoil it but I can't *zips lips and throws away the key*.  And all the trees and mountains we see during the credits is a thing of beauty.  So yeah, if you're looking for a simple suspense, this is probably your film.",1464739200,,3460,4.599673202614379
5751128,5,B00CX7TOOG,"This is a very tense film with superb acting, un-let-up drama, suspense, twists and turns - with one person being on top for a short while until the other is on top, and then over and over again.
In 1992 the Serbian Army invaded Bosnia and massacred civilians calling it ethnic cleansing; 200,000 people were murdered - generally butchered. In 1995 American forces and NATO intervened. Angered and disgusted by what they saw, as in other wars, some US forces committed war crimes, including murder.
The film jumps ahead 18 years. a Serbian is determined to take revenge against a colonel involved in the murder of some Serbians. He has been traumatized by the war - by what he saw and what he did. The Serbian says that his country is beautiful but the beauty is covered by invisible blood that he can see. The colonel is similarly traumatized for the same reasons, so much so that he needs to stay away from society, even his grandchild's christening.
The Serbian comes to the US and confronts the colonel.",1464739200,,1007,4.662921348314606

5751141,3,B00CX7TOOG,"Even though this film won the 2008 Script Pipeline Screenwriting Competition, it totally bombed at the box office and critics gave it horrible reviews. John Travolta is responsible for that because who looks like he's auditioning for Abraham Lincoln with that fake chin curtain beard and black sprayed on hair. The whole film I kelp thinking ""where is your top hat, dude?"" Either that or putting him to pasture on an Amish farm. But that's just looking at him, the real torture comes when he opens his mouth and tries to convince us that he is Serbian. His fake accent is so bad, there are times you can't even understand what he's saying. They expect is to believe that he is an angry former Scorpions soldier that was supposed to have been killed by an American death squad but wasn't (as if), so he's spent the last 18 years of his life looking for when he could get his revenge.

De Niro plays an American veteran and former NATO operative who lives reclusively in a gorgeous cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of upper Georgia. He's basically a hermit, avoiding even his own family because he's still haunted by  his memories of war. He's exchanged his gun for a camera and does different kinds of shooting these days, the kind that requires a darkroom. You wonder then, why he would ever pick up a Serb in the woods of Georgia and invite him into his house for an evening of breaking bread, Johnny Cash records and shots of Jagermeister in the first place. It's just terribly unbelievable.

I want to blame Travolta for this whole mess, and wonder why they didn't they hire a real European actor to play the role instead. There are so many great ones. Maybe this would have inspired De Niro to come out and play more instead of walking through the film looking like all he wanted was for the torture to end and his paycheck at the end. (And by torture, I mean having to be in the film to begin with!) But Travolta... Ugh! I guess he had to be in it because in the original plans for the screenplay, he was supposed to play opposite Nicolas Cage right after the success of Face/Off, but that never happened. Thinking about that fact makes me realize why it's his character whose face gets pierced by an arrow, cheek to cheek and stuck to the side of the cabin awaiting De Niro to saw off the end of the bow with violent movements using what looks like a butter knife from the effort he needs to make.

This film was finally made in 2012 and had they decided to replace Travolta with someone who could carry off the role, this may have been an incredible story. Instead we have a grotesquely bloody and gory game of cat and mouse being played out by two broken men, both still locked in the emotion and pain from the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.

It's hard to watch at times and I had to look away from the scenes of torture, the worst being when Travolta's character makes De Niro pull the rope through the hole in his calf and then strings him up by that leg, and you realize his entire weight is supported only by his calf muscle. Then De Niro's character mixes a pitcher of lemonade like you've never seen before, ""sweetened"" with an entire container of salt and pours it over Travolta's face, where an arrow went through his cheeks, and if that's not bad enough, he makes us sit through waterboarding with the lemonade. It almost has a horror feel at times but the real horror is how badly Travolta acts in this film. Trying to be somehow comical and yet monstrous, he's just buried under that horrible accent. I wanted to say ""Shut up!"" the whole film. More unbelievable is how they even move after what they have physically been through. No one could walk away from that car accident.

Sadly, De Niro is the De Niro of the last 10+ years... He's just there. I'm a fan, so I'm happy to see him in anything, but next to ""The Big Wedding"", this is another poor choice that he looks like he's realized after signing the contracts to be there. I can see the potential, and if he was there, I mean REALLY THERE like he used to be when he was filled with passion about the part, I want to believe that his acting could have carried the whole movie, but if I am completely honest, he just schelps around the beautiful landscape as if he is pissed off he had to leave the comfort of home and make yet another crappy film. It's sad to watch. My personal favorite scene is at the beginning of the film when we see him enjoying the cabin, his old records and making dinner. You're convinced that is what he really wants to be doing, being left alone.

Near the end of the film and the gory torture, you finally discover why this film was previously titled ""Shrapnel"" and you are happy when the ""Killing Season"" finally comes to an end. As the long credits rolled, I thought about all of the many people involved in the making of this film and the potential it had. It could have been a great movie,  if only those involved would have given a damn. It's focus being the psychological wounds that men who have lived through war carry. This could have been an incredible iconic match-up and instead it just fails miserably.",1439078400,3,5125,4.415873015873016

5751149,2,B00CX7TOOG,"""The Killing Season"" is directed by Steven Johnson (Elektra, Daredevil, Grumpy Old Men). This film is about a former Scorpians soldier (John Travolta) who seeks revenge on a Nato colonel (Robert DeNiro). Travolta locates De Niro in the mountains where he has sought refuge from the memories of the war. The film from there becomes a cat and mouse game between the two which is hard to take seriously. We're not sure if this is meant to be a dark comedy, or not, as the two go back and forth between getting the upper hand on the other but never delivering the final blow. I can't say this wasn't entertaining at times, but I couldn't help smirking at everything from Travolta's accent and dyed hair to the relish each takes in inflicting pain on the other individual. There seemed to be an attempt to tell a moralistic story here though this film might have been more effective if another actor had been chosen for John Travolta's character, someone we could take seriously, though the writing doesn't help Robert De Niro's role either. Not the best film, but good for a chuckle even though I'm not sure it was intended this way.",1429574400,,1129,4.621890547263682

5751162,5,B00CX7TOOG,"According to Box Office Mojo, Killing Seasons widest release was to 12 theaters for seven days and then it went to DVD. I think this decision was made because most film audiences in American prefer romance and fantasiesnot the brutal, bloody reality of gory, brutal up close and personal hand-to-hand combat.

The film was released on July 11, 2013, and it was a total flop at the box office earning a total of $39,881 in theaters. Peter Sobcynski reviewed the film and gave it less than one star. Sibczynski says, The film is quite awfulbadly written, ineptly staged, horribly acted, historically suspect and boring beyond beliefand fully deserving of its ignominious fate.

Heres the thing, I don't agree with Sobczynski. I didn't think it was a bad filmand was that because I have no taste, or because Im a former U.S. Marine who fought in Vietnam?

To me, this film reveals rather brutally what combat does to two men, and how war might leave mental scars that run deep.

Heres the plot: In Belgrade, Serbia, former Scorpions soldier Emil Kova (Travolta) meets an informant to retrieve a file on American military veteran and former NATO operative Colonel Benjamin Ford (De Niro). Ford has fled to a cabin retreat somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, to forget the war. Now a recluse, he meets Kova, posing as a European tourist, during a hunting trip. The two men become friendly, until Kova reveals his true identity. Intent on revenge for something Ford allegedly did in Serbia, he initiates a gory game of cat-and-mouse with Ford. The latter is badly injured but is quick to rebound.

I liked the film and recommend it for anyone who wants to discover how brutal hand-to-hand combat can become. It worked for me and it also worked for more than half of the almost 260 customers who reviewed the film on Amazon. Less than 25% rated it with 1-or-2 stars and most of those were one liners with little or no detail.

I bought the DVD at Half Price Books for $6.",1419638400,,1968,4.7063953488372094

John Travolta is a member of the Serb paramilitary Scorpions and Robert De Niro is a US Army officer intervening in the Bosnian genocide. As De Niro and his platoon/company liberate a Serb-run POW camp full of Bosnian Muslims. Afterwards, De Niros unit executes the Serb soldiers. Years later Travoltas character tracks down De Niro and the two have a one to one in the Tennessee mountainous wilderness. The film explores the each of the characters and their personal trauma they endured during the war. Robert De Niros character lives in seclusion, isolates himself from his son and family. John Travoltas character uses religious metaphors about confession and omission of sin. The ending was surprising and an enjoyable film.

Then forces DeNiro to put a cord through the wound and then hangs him upside down by the cord.  Really?  Seriously?  That's what we want to watch?

5751172,5,B00CX7TOOG,First and foremost this movie did not get great reviews on Amazon..that's fine but please consider that most people commenting on this movie most likely are the people that give transformers and other CGI huge explosive movies 5 stars. This movie is a story and it is as simple as a story based around two characters. Too many people cant appreciate a good flick if it bit them in the nose. No one stops and takes in the story anymore they just want explosions and nudity or the Kardashians. I sat back one night with a nice glass of bourbon and honestly enjoyed this movie. Always remember movies are to entertain you not put you in a classroom where everything has to make perfect sense.

5751190,4,B00CX7TOOG,"Killing Season is a taut, gritty, bloody thriller with two legendary actors who seem to give it their all in spite of a smaller scale picture. I was surprised at how people on IMDB or even other sites seem to be bashing this film. The movie isn't going to win any academy awards but the acting by both De Niro and John Travolta is totally solid. John Travolta's accent through out the film is convincing and I have seen him do much worse ones in other films that were not even close to being on par with this one. The movie is simple in its plot and it provides its audience with some fast paced action sequences and a rivalry between two men who are not really over a war that was fought eighteen years prior. The movie is bloody and brutal in many scenes but it isn't a big explosion shoot em up action film-so be warned if that is what you are looking for.

The movie is more of a hand to hand combat, cat and mouse thriller with some old school savagery. The film is interesting in the fact that it is two men facing off against each other and both are looking for some form of redemption. John Travolta is perceived as the villain but yet there is understanding as to why he is doing what he is doing. Robert De Niro looks like the protagonist but there is a darkness in him as well and he is fighting his own demons. I won't give away anything but the movie leaves you at the end with a much better feeling especially of hope then when it began. Killing Season is a terrific low budget thriller that is well worth a watch...And maybe more",1397433600,2,1544,4.198653198653199

Both Robert De Niro and John Travolta are excellent actors and it shows in this story.  Travolta even plays a heavy accent.  Two enemies because of the war, who will win in present day?  The physical wounds may have healed but not emotionally...Great cat and mouse chase.  I would highly recommend for any De Niro and Travolta fan.

Supposedly a metaphor for the Bosnian-Serbian conflict played out in modern day Appalachia this  exercise in futility will do nothing but elicit boredom.  The makers of the film seem more concerned with scenes of torture and focusing the cameras on gaping wounds than making any profound statements.  Robert De Niro seems bored as though waiting for the bank to open to cash the check he received for participating in this sad offering.  Doing his best Boris Badanov impression John Travolta seems to long for the days when he headlined better films like ""Battlefield Earth"".

5751206,3,B00CX7TOOG,"Robert De Niro and John Travolta star in Killing Season (formerly titled Shrapnel) as a retired NATO operative and a former Serbian soldier respectively. Set deep in the Appalachian Mountains, the film follows their bloody battle, one being the hunter and the other the hunted, sometimes switching roles.

The films premise may sound like that of First Blood, but the result is less compelling as thriller or drama. In spite of the graphic violence and beautifully-shot wilderness, killing Season fails to build up tension psychologically or otherwise because of the predictable storyline and underwritten back stories of both characters. Milo Ventimiglia and Elizabeth Olin are wasted in small and forgettable roles.

Still I couldn't hate the film simply because it has two of my favorite stars, even though obviously this is far from their best. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Daredevil Ghost Rider), Killing Season is an average action that could have been better with more skilled direction and perhaps budget, too.",1390089600,,1022,5.302469135802469

Second, John Travolta as a Serb is asking a bit much. Why not cast an English-speaking Slav for the role? Most of the time I was admiring how well Travolta's accent sounded Serbian, but how would I know? I have never met a Serb.

5751247,4,B00CX7TOOG,"Killing Season (Rated R) is written by Evan Daughtry (Divergent and Snow White and the Huntsman) and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (Ghost Rider movies). The 91 minute 220px-Killing_Season_film_posterfilm stars two of my favorites, Robert DeNiro and John Travolta.

During the war in Bosnia, DeNiro (portraying Benjamin Ford) and his platoon stumble on a Serbian soldiers who have decimated a village. Theyve raped the women and killed the men and children. Taking the law into their own hands they form a firing squad and take-out the opposing soldiers, shooting them in the back of the head. Travoltas character (Emil Kovac) is one of those Serbian soldiers. Only he was left for dead.

Angry, Kovac spends his life trying to track down the American soldiers responsible for the firing squad. Ford is a recluse. His marriage went to hell after the war. He barely knows his son. He lives in the mountians in a remote cabin and lives off the land.

While on his way into town, Fords Jeep breaks down. Kovac, posing as a hiker on vacation, assists Ford with getting the Jeep started. They go back to Fords cabin and share dinner, and talk. Before long, it is clear that Kovac is there seeking revenge. Throughout, the two go at each other, back and forth. First Kovac has the upper hand. Then Ford. The torture they pour out is barbaric, and intense. (It almost is comical the cat-and-mouse game, if it weren't so brutal).

Basically, Kovac wants a confession. Ford wants to leave the past in the past. It seems like the only way this will resolve is if one of them dies  and they way they go at it, death seems highly likely!

Killing Season was . . . good. I enjoyed it. It could be because of the actors, though. I am not sure. I do know I did not play with my phone during it. It held my interest. I could not wait to see what would happen next. It was neither actors best film, not by a long shot. But it was solid for a thriller. The story was interesting. Seeing each soldiers different point of view was interesting. I give Killing Season 4 out of 5!

While Emil Kovac (Travolta), a Bosnian who is really a Serbian war criminal who was captured and supposedly executed by Ford and his fellow NATO troops after they liberated a Bosnian internment camp that he was helping to run. Having survived the bullet Ford put in his back, Kovac has finally tracked him down and now wants to go after him in a fair fight in order to get revenge and exorcise his demons about the conflict.

Considering the star power involved and the story premise which on the surface seems like a great plot line, I had high expectations for the movie.  Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed as it didn't quite live up to what I had hoped it to be.  The acting is ok enough as both De Niro and Travolta do a decent job at playing their roles.  The problem here is the storyline meanders a bit and is a bit choppy all the way through and the action sequences are a bit of a letdown.  The movie at times is a bit slow and boring as well.

The senselessness of it all. My guess is this movie captures that a little. I assume from budget constraints or time restraints that the editor was forced to use lousy takes. This same restriction allowed for flaws in make up to show because the close-ups were just too close. This allowed for some really bad acting to show up in the final version of this movie. This actually made the acting look bad at times. But it does pull together and convey the more general idea that ""war is hell"" but the more disturbing attribute that for many there is no end in sight. And like the end of Blade Runner ""Maybe he just liked life and decided to let me live.... Not my life but any bodies life"" Dekard said in the narration.  In the end this movie just shows me a smaller version of same stupid things that people are compelled to do to each other for some nebulous reason. To win a war but nobody really wins.

5751293,2,B00CX7TOOG,"KILLING SEASON will likely make you cringe for two reasons: #1: John Travolta's ludicrous Serbian accent (why didn't they just cast a real European?) and #2: the sight of two old Hollywood actors literally poking holes into one another.

To see Travolta and DeNiro in an action film becomes painful to watch partly because there's an inherent weakness to the treatment & execution PLUS the fact that they're being paid a lot of money to do this.  The show should have been titled Who's Torturing Who as the two men take turns kicking each other about and doing truly nasty things that are no doubt designed to shock the audience (Ooh!).

While the filmmakers may have had noble intentions with the violent setups, it is difficult to enjoy the film which veers between bad accents and B-movie setups.  This despite a poignant ending scene by DeNiro that underscores the message of the story.  The film actually has a decent conclusion, but by that time, we're exhausted in watching Travolta and DeNiro rolling around in their sandbox for 90 minutes - and relieved when the end comes.

So while the film has some minor highlights, the overall experience probably isn't worth it, unless you're pining for a DeNiro fix or want to see Travolta return to his pre-Pulp Fiction acting form.

The setting, the backdrop of the Appalachian mountains was essential to the motives of DiNero's character and essential to the larger picture of the story and all it implied. John Travolta as a former Serbian soldier gives a very good performance and he is convincing.

It's a talky movie with good scenery and some action with 2 big stars and a Big Message. Problem for me was ""What's the message""? Futility of war? Mankind once again sinking to the lowest common denominator (atrocities on both sides)? War is bad? Or if you lose yourself in the horror, what do you become? Is there atonement or forgiveness down the line - if so, where and when? OK, you get the idea. The 2 main characters did not ring true for me, just did not seem realistic, I felt they were acting 'too hard' to be believable. Travolta especially, but De Niro hasn't really shown us anything new in quite awhile either. They did OK - faint praise, I know, but that's how I feel about the whole movie.

Take Travolta looking in his mid-thirties and outfit him with the lamest ""Serbian"" accent you could possible imagine. Now send Johnny Travaltovitz on a mission to kill Travis Bickle Sr. with a bow and arrow. Now, before you mistake this story for the plot of the greatest comedy since Mel Brook's Blazing Saddles remember this is a ""serious"" film about war. For this reason the characters (who are constantly untying the knots holding them while the other character stands with his back to them reminiscing about the horrors of war) break into long, long meaningless soliliquies that would make Col. Kurtz in Apocolypse Now blush. Finally after several totally meaningless hours of knifing, stabbing, drinking, and telling stupid jokes the two give up, sit on a cliff edge, and call it a day. Bickle Sr. then goes to see his son and make nice nice, while Travoltovitz goes to a bar in Serbia, shoots down a shot of brandy, and stares meaninglessly into a misty mirror. The horror, the horror... P.S. The only good part was watching De Niro strung up by his bleeding leg. For this movie they should consider a similar treatment at the Academy Awards.

5751329,3,B00CX7TOOG,"It's always nice to see an actor playing a part that suits their age rather than attempt something they are far too old for. I recently found it difficult to accept Sharon Stone playing an investigative reporter in BORDER RUN because the role was definitely something an actress in her late 20s or early 30s should have been playing. So when I heard that Robert DeNiro was going to be playing a vet of the Bosnian war in KILLING SEASON I was wondering how it would play out. Fortunately it comes off pretty well.

DeNiro plays Benjamin Ford, an ex-military man who now resides in a cabin in the woods. While we aren't quite sure why he chooses to live out away from people we know there is a reason. Called by his son to attend his grandson's baptism, Ford turns down the offer choosing instead to remain secluded at home.

At the same time we're introduced to Emil Kovac (John Travolta), a Serb who is intent on tracking down Ford. As the movie opened we witnessed a group of Serbian soldiers being executed by U.S. military personnel. It's safe to assume Ford was in this group. But why, if they were executed, would Kovac be seeking him out? Revenge for himself? For family? Only time will tell.

As the film progresses we see Ford having problems with an old war wound, running out of aspirin and heading for town to buy some. Along the way he runs into a hiker walking along the road about the same time his jeep conks out on him. The hiker is, of course, Kovac. He helps Ford get the jeep started again and after heading the other direction in the rain, Ford turns around and offers him a place to stay for the night at his cabin.

The two sit down to dinner and drinks, Kovac having brought along a bottle of Jagermeister. As the liquor loosens their tongues the two share their thoughts of battles past and of their own personal histories. While Kovac pretends to know only what he's read about war Ford lets him know in no uncertain terms that there is much horror to be found there, that it isn't the glorious warrior way so many depict it as. When all is said and done they turn in with plans to hunt the next day.

During this hunting trip things change. Both men are armed with bow and arrow combinations but its photography that interests Ford now. That is until an arrow goes whizzing past him, narrowly striking him in the head. Kovac reveals his true mission for being there, to take down Ford for what happened in the past (which I won't reveal here).

The pair struggle through the woods back and forth, one having the advantage over the other and then switching as circumstances change things. Through it all they continue to talk about the horrors of war and what it means to those who fought in them. Just who will survive this confrontation in the woods isn't revealed until the end of the film.

As I said, it was nice to see DeNiro playing a role that could actually suit his age. Had he been in the Bosnian War he would have been in his 50s and how he looks now he could have been in his 40s. As a career military man that's possible. His character is one who is tormented by his past, what he saw and what he participated in. Here we are 18 years later and he still hasn't come to terms with that. That makes for the subtle parts of the character he plays here.

Travolta also fits the age bracket for this role. Sporting a semi-beard and a thick accent, he pulls off the role of Kovac with ease. There are many who would say that Travolta was just a pretty boy in most of his roles but they would be doing him a disservice. He brings a depth to Kovac that proves he is quite capable of bringing something to a role that some refuse to see. He's a much better actor than given credit for and proves so here.

KILLING SEASON offers a combination of story and action that holds your interest from start to finish. You want to find out what the back story is, you want to know if Kovac is seeking justice or revenge, you want to know just what has twisted Ford's head for these 18 years and if he will change. The movie may not be Oscar material but it does offer a nice combination of entertainment and thought provoking story that makes it worth watching.",1378944000,,4181,4.329501915708812

I'm like, this is an old movie? No? Well, I 've never even heard of it.! But I've loved every movie these two icons have ever done. So, I watched it....alright, who blew the advertising on this movie!? Now, as a rule I don't review books (too many Einstein's out there) and I rarely review video's because it's just as bad, but this is a cool flick. let me break it down short for you: a group of extremists are killing and torturing people. The UN goes in and stops it. The leaders of the extremists are put to death...but one does not die.

  And for eighteen years the survived looks for the man that shot him in the back...
  He finds him. And now, he's going hunting.

A man lives alone in the mountains (Robert De niro) A recluse trying to forget his horrid past. Be is estranged to bis family be cause of his mental....differences....now, if he shoots an animal, it's with a camera..

  All of a sudden, a stranger appears. By chance or no, Robert De niros character picks a lone man up in the rain. He seems harmless enough. He only carries nothing but an ancient long bow, unstrung...feeling sorry for the guy in the pouring rain, he decides to give the guy shelter for the night. Thay have a nice supper together. A hunt is planned for the morrow....well the next day De niro finds out the hard way who this guy is.

5751348,1,B00CX7TOOG,"Good News first. This movie has two above average aspects; cinematography, and Robert DiNero. Camerawork does a fine job of taking you into the Black Forrest, and making you feel like you are there. DiNero is the textbook example of how to act, no matter what the script. Very beliveable character, and as an old soldier, I saw myself in him at times, especially with the personality ""quirks"". This is what the star is for. End of good news.

Bad News. While I could go on and on, I will spare you. Just the high points. First and foremost, I don't know who the director was yet, but will make a point to NEVER again contribute to his livelyhood. While I do not believe in censorship, and Art is just that; fiction, one must own a certain ethic when producing media that could represent truth to the easily impressionable and ignorant. The US never has, nor ever will, execute prisoners on the battlefield. Nazis and Taliban; yes. American uniformed forces, NO! The movie opens like a documentary with statistics and historical reference, then shows captured Serbs being shot in the head while kneeling and bound, by US Army personnel. While many will not understand the difference, it is what allows us to hold the slightest shred of decency as soldiers, even when our politicians may be idiots all. Sure, acts of atrocity are commited by uniformed soldiers, but not as a matter of doctrine, rather individual acts of treason. Soldiers should not kill non-combatants, and bound prisoners are just that. Why DiNero would choose this script is puzzling, but is evidence of the statement this movie makes about how bankrupt Hollywood creativity is at the moment. There are no good scripts, or he would not have taken this DOG.

Lastly, speaking of DOGs, I have not enjoyed Travolta since Pulp Fiction, where he was a perfect fit for his role. While it was pretty fun seeing him get stabbed in the leg in Savages, his current market value is also puzzling. Insofar as a Serbian national , his head is way too big, both figuratively and literally. Did not convince for one second that the accent was genuine, nor the resentment that fueled the character's vengence. All the fury of a Manatee, with a comical facial hair patch. That should have been the biggest red flag.

This is one I wish I could unsee, as the statement made is how both Hollywood, and the Military Bashing Media that so influences them ( or is it the other way around? ) have nothing to offer. I want my time back, you can keep my money as a fine on me.",1378080000,6,2519,4.605790645879733

Travolta is a former Serbian death squad member who has a bone to pick with De Niro,  Seems De Niro was a US Army colonel who fought 10 years prior in the Kosovo campaign and he crossed paths with Travolta. The subsequent flashback scenes that set up the premise seem off the mark as both men look way too old to have participated in the Kosovo action. FYI, De Niro is 70 years old and no amount of makeup or fuzzy lighting makes him appear realistic playing a 37 - 40 year old in the flashbacks.
Plot line is straightforward and most readers will guess the outcome an hour before the movie ends.  Found my mind wandering ... was De Niro's cabin available for short term vacation rental?  Didn't it look a little cluttered? What moron director thought a man could run at near full speed shortly after an arrow went completely through the femur bone?

In real life, I doubt very seriously that a Serbian rebel would forgive an American soldier for killing his family and fellow mates in Serbia during the Serbian/Croatian war.

Unfortunately, director Mark Steven Johnson is no Robert Aldrich although, to be fair, it doesn't help that both of his actors are so thoroughly miscast.  John Travolta pushes his fake eastern European accent hard to little effect and Robert De Niro appears at least 10 years too old to have been a field soldier in the 90's.

John Travolta plays a Serb with an Abe Lincoln beard. Over a decade after the Bosnian War, he searches out Robert De Niro at his rustic mountain cabin, spends the evening drinking Jaegermeister with him never letting on that he's come to kill De Niro for something he did during that conflict.

They agree to go bow hunting for deer. In the early morning they separate in the field.
This is when Travolta's true intention is revealed.
He begins hunting De Niro with a bow, wounds him in the leg when he could've killed him.
Travolta soon runs a badly limping De Niro down. Rather than kill him he wants to talk about why he's done all this.
But first, a little torture...

I really liked this one.
The first surprise is John Travolta who is unrecognizable as Robert De Niro's pursuer. From what I can tell he does a great Slavic accent, too. Next is De Niro's performance. At age sixty-nine he was still vigorous and limber enough to take on a trying physical role. I was most impressed by him in this picture and think it's a marvel that in a half century of acting De Niro has rarely looked bad in a film.

Just think of his extensive film resum. What an awesome body of work!",1377216000,,1397,5.012931034482759

The story revolves around DeNiro playing a retired Army vet; during the Bosnian War, he shot a Serbian soldier (Travolta)in the back of the head. Travolta makes a miraculous recovery and 18 years later, comes seeking revenge/redemption. Script is muddled and action sequences are forced, implausible, and predictable.

5751377,1,B00CX7TOOG,"Fifteen years ago, the first big-screen teaming of Robert De Niro and John Travolta might have been a genuine event. Now it's just another dubious paycheck job for a pair of aging hams that's getting a token theatrical release a month ahead of its arrival on video.

""Killing Season'' provides Travolta -- with a shaved head, an Amish-style beard and a thick, dubious accent -- endless opportunities to chew the scenery as a loquacious Serbian soldier who somehow survived a mass execution by US soldiers during the Balkan ethnic wars in 1995.

Eighteen years later, he has tracked down the grumpy leader of that death squad, played by De Niro. The latter is living a hermitic existence in an overdecorated cabin in the Appalachians and avoiding his very briefly glimpsed family.

You would think someone who executed a bunch of Serbians would be wary of meeting one by chance in the woods, but De Niro invites Travolta to his cabin for a very tedious evening of drunken conversation and listening to Johnny Cash records.

The next morning, De Niro -- who has foresworn guns for cameras -- agrees to join Travolta for a deer hunt, with both men carrying crossbows. It soon becomes apparent that De Niro is Travolta's actual prey.

If you've always wanted to see Robert De Niro forced to thread a steel rod through an open wound and then strung upside down by John Travolta, this is the movie for you.

Ditto if the idea of De Niro firing an arrow that pierces both of Travolta's cheeks and pins him to the cabin door sounds appealing.

Not to mention De Niro waterboarding his wounded prey with heavily salted lemonade.

Mark Steven Johnson, who directed such cinematic landmarks as ""Ghost Rider'' and ""Daredevil,'' moves the muddled story along at a snail's pace toward an anti-climactic ending in which God is invoked repeatedly.

He throws in lots of scenic shots to pad things out to barely an hour and a half.

De Niro mostly looks miserable and very tired and prattles on endlessly about forgetting the past.

You better believe he's trying to forget the dreadful ""Killing Season,'' which the busy actor shot at least half a dozen films ago.",1377129600,,2147,4.7601078167115904
5751378,4,B00CX7TOOG,"WARNING:POSSIBLE SPOILERS(SUBJECTIVE PLOT/STORY FOCUS REVIEW)****-Just got done watching it, I liked it, story is okay being linked to the bosnian war. The basic plot intrigued me and I'm personally a sucker for hunting & hitman films, especially when its simply two opposing characters squaring off one on one, witch is exactly what this film is. Of course John Trovolta's fake serbian accent is bothersome and even annoying at times, but hey whatever, I like his past work so I was able to let it slide. Robert Deniro is just awesome in this one, he really made the viewing worth it for me personally. I also like it when a film or story has the protagonist carrying a handicap and disadvantage against the antagonist, it adds a more exciting dynamic and has makes me wonder how the hero will defeat/overcome the villain,  if he even defeats him at all. The ending was awesome and personally the best ending I would want for the film. There is alot of action, Deniro is fantastic in my opinion even for his age, he did great in the action scenes. OK NOW, chemistry between the two(& keep in mind it's really just these 2 actors for most of the film) was very interesting to see in my opinion. I myself am the kind of viewer who really honestly does not care or pay to much attention to chemistry between actors/characters in film. I of course find interaction between actors/characters in films fun and important sometimes, but overall Im passive about it. The interaction between Benjamin Ford(Robert DeNiro) & Emil Kovac(John Travolta) is again interesting enough to have kept my attention, It didn't bore me at all and the resolution between the two satisfied me personally. I recommend to those who like a hunter VS hunter, soldier VS soldier type of deal, kind of like the film Enemy At The Gates for example with Jude Law & ED Harris facing off ass 2 WW2 elite snipers.

This is a revenge movie, turned hunter and the hunted, and kill-or-be-killed. De Niro and Travolta hunt each other in the mountains, setting traps and stalking each other in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse.

Not for the faint of heart. In one scene a steel rod is pierced through De Niro's open wound and he is hung upside down by it. But there is some exciting scenes too, real pulse-pounders, as one could only imagine what it would be like to be hunted by a trained killer in the mountain fog.

5751404,4,B00CX7TOOG,"The tagline for his moody, atmospheric, harrowing and insightful films is `The purest form of war is one on one' and that generally encircles the mood of the film from beginning to end. Written by Evan Daugherty and directed by Mark Steven Johnson this is a small cast film that concentrates much of the destructive impact of war on those who fight it and survive it. Many people seem to expect more from a film than simply viewing how war eats the brain and memory and after-war life, concentrating responses on actors' accents and implausible encounters, but the message is delivered well if you are open to hear it.

KILLING SEASON is the confrontation of two veterans of the Bosnian War, an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1 March 1992 and 14 December 1995 and is still remembered for the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaigns and the violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas endured  murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, and deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas. One veteran is American, Benjamin Ford (Robert De Niro) whose life has become one of being a recluse in the back hills of Appalachia, ignoring his family and struggling with the atrocities he not only witnessed but participated in: the other a Serbian, Emil Kovac (John Travolta) who narrowly escaped assassination by Ford and the American troops and since the war has been hunting for Ford to make him confess his war crimes and suffer the consequences. Ford and Kovac meet surreptitiously at Ford's little cabin, and at first exchange food and drink only to have the reality surface of Kovac's intent to kill Ford. The remainder of the film is a cat-and-mouse game that braces the wills of each survivor in treacherous manners that make each man reopen old war wounds and find a new universality in the effects of war on the human mind.

The film is shot in Georgia (cinematography is by Peter Menzies, Jr) with flashback black and white and sepia toned footage of the horrors of the Bosnian War. De Niro and Travolta manage these difficult roles well in this basically two-person film (Ford's son and daughter in law and new baby are adroitly played by Milo Ventimiglia and Elizabeth Olin, and the early scenes in Serbia are polished by performances by Diana Lyubenova, Kalin Sarmenov and Stefan Shterev). The tension is underlined by a fine musical score composed by Christopher Young.

This film may not meet everyone's expectations of big noisy extravaganzas, but as a powerful antiwar statement is works exceptionally well. Grady Harp, July 13",1374969600,,2880,5.095338983050848
5751405,4,B00CX7TOOG,"Killing Season reminds me of Dead Man Down in that both movies received so little publicity and hype, but both of them are unexpected gems.  This movie is a well-written story of two men reeling from the Bosnian War.  They are broken and pursuing the wrong paths in life.  When they clash, it is for a good reason.  And that clash is pretty entertaining.

The characters are developed enough for a movie that feels like a really enjoyable short story--if that makes sense.  The acting is superb--how could it not be?  Surprisingly, the action is tense and realistic.  The plot contains quite a few twists as well.  I enjoyed not knowing what would happen.

Furthermore, this movie presents a deeper message about war and humanity that it refuses to shove down your throat.  In the end, you will contemplate war, the effects of war, the duties of a man as a human being, and all that sort of existential stuff.

Definitely a surprisingly fun film to watch.  Who doesn't want to see two guys battle it out in the woods?  While it is not a life-shattering experience, it is light years beyond the crap we get from Hollywood.  If you enjoy meaningful movies with alternating paces and realistic violence, go for it.

5751406,5,B00CX7TOOG,"This movie was so good I even watched the 10 minutes of closing credits. The images and soundtrack during that closing period were as good then as they were throughout the entire movie. This movie was a true roller coaster of suspense, drama and action. It is a deeply enriching movie with a subtle message, one that Hollywood is not known for, but it is there. To really understand the fullness of that message, watch those final closing credits and listen to the songs. If you are an astute listener, paying attention to the entire movie, you will have already gotten the message before then. This is essentially a two-man movie. The other few people who appear are more extras than anything. So the burden of this movie in on the shoulders of two of our finest males actors.

In my opinion, this was a stellar movie. The outdoors scenes are beautifully shot. The suspense is intense. The action rugged and at times brutal.
Fight scene coordination is credited to the legendary Jeff Imada.

I paid the $6.99 price to see it now, because I sensed from the preview and the cast that it would be well worth that price. I was correct. I never give spoilers in my reviews, so you will have to depend on others for all that. If you love riveting action movies that pit man against man in the most harrowing of ways, this is one you will want to see, at least once. Some of it was shot in Bulgaria.

Thanks for reading my review. Peace.

PS: I have to laugh at those who cannot deal with Travolta's accent. He is playing the role of a Serbian Death Squad member. The accent is to lend realism to the character. It is easy to understand him, IF YOU LISTEN. This is not Honey Boo-Boo or some mindless ""reality"" show that you can watch while playing on the Xbox, cooking supper, or whatever it is you do. Americans are quick to turn off a person whose accent differs from theirs. This is sad.

8587181,4,B00CX7TOOG,"Not specifically my type of movie but friend recommended, so I gave it a Saturday night watch. To my surprise kept me interested the whole time and once the story revealed what was inside of the minds that created the reasoning for desired revenge it changed my opinion to one I would recommend also. Has a lesson of reasoning: that the past is not worth the loss of mental time to continue to relive agony of events of war, much less hurts that come in many fashions on our journey through life.  Seeking revenge does not take away the pain of yesterday but only blinds our heart of the beauty each new sunrise allows us to experience.  The Killing Season, for this reminder to me was a Excellent watch!",1493424000,,704,4.449612403100775
