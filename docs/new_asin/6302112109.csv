424534,5,6302112109,"Dark and suspensful,""The Scar"" is a real sleeper. It seldom appears on anybody's list of essential films noirs. Part of the reason is surely confusion with the alternate title ""Hollow Triumph"".  Nonetheless, this independently produced gem contains the very essence of noir. Paul Henreid memorably plays a convict who tries to change his own fate by taking advantage of a fantastic coincidence: recently released from prison and looking for a fresh start--he stumble upon a successful psychiatrist who is his exact double. The rest of the film spins a wonderful web of intrigue. And it doesn't hurt to have Joan Bennett along for the ride. Really a well-produced B movie, ""The Scar"" does utilize some plot cliches, but it proceeds with an unrelenting feeling of doom. Directed by Steve Szekely in a Fritz Lang-influenced style, this film should appeal to fans of ""The Woman in the Window"" or ""Scarlet Street"".",989798400,9,909,5.06

-The Scar premise...could have made it a little more believable (you may know what I mean when you see it)

I love the feel of this movie.  I think that this movie is consistently engaging and has just enough tension to keep you one your toes (you don't sit there waiting for something to happen).  I love the ending too.  I think the irony is something that has been done before and since, but it was done so well I didn't see it coming.

424657,5,6302112109,"Thick, Tragic characters. One is left both hating the lead man and at the same time feeling pity for him. You want him to get caught and you want him to get away. I hated him for being so evil and loved him for being so existentially human- trying to 'figure out' the balance between one's compulsions, passions and purpose. Some of the conventions are predictable, over used - like the use of shadows, irony, gambling debts, mobsters and acceptance of a scar as being sufficient to murk one's identity.. However, I did not expect the ending  and the scene with the motherly wash lady at the end left me wondering 'what does that mean?'. I am very pleased with this movie.",1429315200,3,672,4.508196721311475

424659,4,6302112109,"Disclaimer: The version of the film that I saw was included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Mysteries-Collection/dp/B002ID098A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Mysteries Collection</a>, and, as such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this Alpha Video release.  My review has to do with the entertainment value of the film only.

Every time I saw the opening credits for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B001EBWING/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>, I would wonder about the filmography of Paul Henreid.  In comparison with the other stars of that film, he was the one that seemed to come out of nowhere, yet he also was ranked (if the size of the titles mean anything) as a peer of Bogart, et al.  Except I'd never heard of anything else he'd been in, before or after.  In THE SCAR, we get to see Victor Laszlo's corrupt older brother, morally adrift and consumed with self-regard and greed as he twists Joan Bennett's career girl role into Freudian knots.  This atmospheric, deftly underplayed film (shot by John Alton and helmed by Steve Sekely) isn't ever going to rival CASABLANCA in any category, but it's still an interesting film of light and shadows, even if the plot stretches credulity.

Henreid is Johnny Muller - college educated smart guy, but discontented with the straight and narrow.  He's a high roller by nature, taking chances, and the film opens as he's released from prison after one chance too many.  Soon it's back to old tricks, and another heist, this time from a crooked gambling house.  This too goes wrong, and soon Muller is on the run.  Fate seems to step in though, in the form of a psychiatrist who is the spitting image of Muller, except for one detail, a prominent scar on the doctor's face.  In a desperate gamble, Johnny looks to get rid of the good doctor and take his place, and even to fool his uber-savvy working girl assistant (Bennett).  But the doc has secrets of his own, which may be just as deadly as those Muller is running from.

While the doppelganger aspect wears a little thin, there are still some excellently shot scenes in the film, and fans of noir in general and John Alton's cinematography in particular should enjoy this effort.  Henreid and Bennet both make the most of the material that they are given, though as I said, it doesn't seem especially believable to me.  Far better are the technical aspects, which are enough to bump this one from three-and-a-half stars up to four.  A sleeper that deserves a little more exposure.

The edition I watched, as part of the Midnight Mystery Collection by PopFlix, is no great shakes, but it's not a terrible transfer either.  We're not likely to get a cleaned up version of this film anytime soon, so I can say I'm happy with the picture for the tradeoff in price.  Presented in 1.33:1 and with a runtime of 82 minutes, it tallies with the specs on this Alpha release, a company about which I've heard a lot of negatives.  Those interested in the film may want to consider an alternative to the individual release, such as either the Midnight Mysteries, or else&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B0000C2IVH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>&nbsp;from Vci Video, whose Forgotten Noir series had a lot of positive features, albeit for some truly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/forgettable-films/dp/B000NJLM0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">forgettable films</a>, at least in the example I saw.",1347840000,,3636,5.527075812274369
424660,5,6302112109,"An awful lot of classic films noir revolve around doubling - mistaken identities - stolen identitities - and other troubling and eerie manifestations of the concept that our individualities, our selves, may not really be as uniques as we wish them to be. I'm not sure that any film in the style goes as far into the psychological ramifications of such issues as Steve Sekely's 1948 masterpiece, produced by and starring Paul Henreid.

Henreid must have wanted to get away from the often bland continental romantic leads that he'd been playing for the previous several years. This was the first film he produced, and it led off a very successful second career as a producer/director, mostly in TV - though he was to remain, and still remains well after his death, known to all but the fairly serious film buffs only for his role in CASABLANCA.  Here Henreid plays medical school dropout/criminal John Muller, getting out of prison in the first scene with the promise of a boring but respectable straight job in California. He doesn't want it and soon gets into trouble knocking over the gambling operation of a bigger gangster in Florida - and going on the run to avoid a bullet-riddled fate.

Muller tries to play it safe and straight for a little while in Los Angeles, but a chance encounter with a dentist who swears that he looks just like Dr. Bartok, the psychiatrist that works in the same medical building changes his mind. Investigating the psychiatrist's operation he finds that indeed he bears a startling resemblance - a fact not unnoticed by Bartok's secretary and apparent paramour Evelyn (Joan Bennett), who soon falls under Muller's slick charm and ends up half-knowingly helping him out in his scheme to find out as much as possible about Bartok.

I won't spoil what happens when Muller is finally ready to take over Bartok's identity and life, and the complications that ensue; suffice it to say that he makes a very large and obvious mistake - but soon finds out that people don't often see the facts that are right in front of their very eyes. And so he is lulled and fooled into a sense of false security - and manages to convince Evelyn that he has, in fact, managed to become a different person more-or-less; until he finds out that the doctor and he had something else in common that he in his arrogance overlooked just as the people around him overlooked his own mistakes.

THE SCAR has a lot to say about how we fool ourselves, and the folly of arrogance - and of those who trust the arrogant and self-confident men who are really unable to face up to their own mistakes. It's about the power of psychological masks and how they oftentimes can completely overawe and sublimate the physical masks we make for ourselves. Henreid manages an almost impossible task - making a truly despicable person almost likeable - or at least believable and pitiable; and Bennett is fine as well. John Alton's photography is as good as ever, which is saying an awful lot. I first watched this film a couple of years ago in a mediocre St. Clair Vision transfer - alas the print on this Alpha disc isn't any better but a second viewing really helps to piece together both the wonderful psychological ramifications of the story and the physical beauty of the film, even if it is somewhat hidden in the poor dupe transfer.  The noir enthusiast is probably best off getting the similarly priced VCI edition of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Scar-The-Limping-Man/dp/B0000C2IVH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Scar/The Limping Man</a>&nbsp;which also offers Cy Endfield's fascinating Brit-noir THE LIMPING MAN and a terrific half-hour noirish TV program from 1955 with Edmond O'Brien, THE DARK STRANGER.",1265673600,5,3750,4.963375796178344

Two men discuss a candidate for release from prison. ""It's a good job."" $35 a week for Muller. Johnny has to catch up with life. ""What's her name?"" His friends have jobs. Johnny wants to rob a gambling casino, but it is dangerous even if you get away. They hold up the cashier, people at the gambling tables don't notice them. But there is a hitch in the plan. Two are caught and squeal. The man with Johnny is scared and wants to go to South America. Johnny settles down to a 9 to 5 job. Who is following Johnny? Could someone look like him? Rocky Stanzig's boys are looking for Johnny now. Where can he hide? Johnny is a schemer. Can he imitate another man's voice and signature? [Does this story become unbelievable?]

Johnny applies for a job at the Clover Garage. Can he impersonate Victor Bartok? [Did he make a mistake?] ""Check the oil."" Is Johnny hiding in plain sight? Will Johnny do a bad thing? People don't notice anything, they only think about themselves. The patients talk. A telephone call from a woman is handled smoothly. His brother is looking for Johnny. Evelyn Hahn gets an idea. Stanzig was arrested, Johnny isn't being hunted. Evelyn isn't happy anymore. [Corrosive cynicism?] Will Johnny give up his sweet life to leave with Evelyn for Hawaii? Two men follow him. Bartok has an unpleasant surprise. His pursuit of happiness runs out of time for an ironic ending. Johnny can't escape his fate.

Parts of this story seem incredible, but it is all part of a morality play where the bad are punished in the end. Most people live in the community they were born in. It would be difficult for a stranger to impersonate a member of the community, but not to join as a distant relative. There were other stories about people who impersonated someone only to find more problems.",1263168000,,1814,4.575384615384616
424662,3,6302112109,"Henreid is terrific in his role. His character's shrink-theory philosophy - most folks are so wrapped up in themselves that they notice little else - is played out nicely as the film rolls along. Except for Bennet's character. That she didn't see the switcheroo from the get-go is so unbelievable it ruined the story for me right there. The dialog is great, as is the pacing. Too bad the print copy doesn't do the original cinematography justice.",1253750400,,446,4.805194805194805
424663,4,6302112109,"The highest ranked film noir in the massive ""Film Noir Bible"" is Steve Sekely's THE SCAR a.k.a. HOLLOW TRIUMPH.

Fresh out of prison John Muller is disgusted to find out that the members of his old crew have all gotten jobs.  He pressures them into helping him rob a gambling hall that's run by the toughest boss in town.  The heist is a bust and only John and one other guy get out alive, they split the dough and John goes into hiding in Los Angeles.

On the lam, John gets a normal 9 to 5 job then one day while out running errands a guy (John Qualen from THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE and THE SEARCHERS!) mistakes John for a local psychiatrist.  This gives John an idea.  He starts romancing the doctor's secretary and learns everything he can about the doctor.  Finally he's trained himself to a perfect double except for the huge scar on the doctor's cheek.  John better hurry and make the switch soon cause the goon squad is closing in.  There's much more to the story but I can't say anymore without giving it all away.

For a low budget picture THE SCAR looks great (wish I could say the same for the fuzzy Alpha Video DVD) with dark, brooding shadows and imaginative camerawork.  There's one shot towards the end that tripped me out.  I rewound it four times because I liked it so much.

A definite must see for noir fans.

Hey Criterion how about a lesser known noir box set with THE SCAR, DETOUR, ARMORED CAR ROBBERY, THE HITCH-HIKER, PRIVATE HELL 36 and ACT OF VIOLENCE.",1132185600,7,1486,4.395604395604396
424664,5,6302112109,"The great John Alton's cinematography is dimmed but not nearly destroyed by Alpha's contrasty and weathered-looking transfer.  But as this isn't an easy film to get hold of in any shape, I can put my qualms about Alpha's typical technical quality aside in this case.

John Alton was born in Austria-Hungary in 1901, and after working his way through the ranks in allied studio positions (film labs, etc) he eventually photographed many of the films that define the noir style for us today. In most every case, these films are worth watching more for the atmosphere his brilliant eye hewed out of the dark for them than for their story content. As DP he had a major impact on the visual style of such noir essentials and cult favorites as T-Men, Raw Deal, He Walked By Night, The People Against O'Hara, I, The Jury, The Big Combo and others. He was better than most anyone at taking the location shooting that was often necessitated by budget on noir films (which were not the ""prestige"" productions of their time) and making it work, investing it with a poetry and capturing the gritty atmosphere.

You realize in its first couple of minutes, from a simple scene of a man walking down a hallway, that The Scar is going to be a film of visual distinction. Without Alton, The Scar would still be a neat film because of the plot, the nifty twist and the memorable finish. But Alton lifts it to another level of visual eloquence and feeling. It remains rivetingly watchable. I give this copy of The Scar 5 stars and recommend this DVD -- one of the few Alpha DVD's that I would recco-- without reservation.",1111276800,13,1602,4.594405594405594
