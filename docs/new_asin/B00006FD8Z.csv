8228256,5,B00006FD8Z,"I like this series. It's a shame that it's all-too-short-lived.
Action is great, comedy is hammy and sometimes forced - much like anime is prone to be. But, overall, this is a great follow-up to the first set.
Stick with this, and avoid the movie follow-up. Once they go CGI vehicles, the series loses its charm.
It's the hand-drawn detail of the cars that makes petrol heads like myself squee!

So glad that I've revisited this!",1357344000,,429,4.644736842105263

8228258,4,B00006FD8Z,"As if the competition between Lisa and Souichi wasn't bad enough, there's another ex-driver visiting the city, Rei, whose motorcycle skills might put her beyond either of their levels. It doesn't sit well with Lisa that Rei also seems to busting a few moves with her bust and naked body on her under-age comrade Souichi, whose primary reaction is sweating and blushing. It seems as if maybe Lisa has a little more interest in her rival and classmate than she wants to admit. The last two episodes on the dvd concern the arrival of Joe Todo and his gasoline powered street car gang. Joe used to be an ex-driver but he was seen as too wild and uncontrolled so he was fired. Now he's back to seek revenge by putting the ex-drivers out of commission and terrorizing the city streets. In the end it's up to Souichi to beat Joe in a no-holds barred race to the finish!

I really enjoyed this show even though the basic plot premise seems a bit boring. The kinetic action of the pristine animation and the great sound of authentic racing engines combined with some very likeable characters combine to make something unique. And Rei...the hotness factor went up a bit with her erotic design to make little boys pine and slobber. The only complaint I have is that there are only two volumes of the series.",1144972800,,1296,4.562231759656652
