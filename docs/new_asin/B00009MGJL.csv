7991866,5,B00009MGJL,I think that it is a story that reaches out to everyone. Amitabh Bachchans dual role was handled with special care to make it believable. A Father makes a fast decision that leaves his family and relationships in a bad light. Which later has to be corrected by acceptance of the son and  Father.,1383350400,,295,4.462962962962963
