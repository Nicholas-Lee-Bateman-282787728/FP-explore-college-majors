If you want a new golf video for the collection don't hesitate here on this one. We watched it a few times and enjoyed it each time. When golf friends come over and we put it on they are amused as well. This would be a good gift for a golfing friend - especially low to mid handycappers that are easily amused and say ""wow"" a lot, like me.

Great price - impressive skills shown-off by the Hit Man in a enjoyable way.",1292544000,,421,4.0
8162227,5,B000LMPN04,"We had the opportunity to see Chuck, the Hit Man's performance in person at the Silverleaf Club in Arizona.  He was so amazing, it was hard to believe he was for real.  This guy is entertaining and if you are a golfer you'll appreciate his phenominal hand, eye and body coordination.  He is a machine.  He was so good, we bought this DVD.",1173916800,,338,4.317460317460317
