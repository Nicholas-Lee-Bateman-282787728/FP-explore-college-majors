2208306,1,B0007CILL6,"This DVD is not so ""magnificent"" as indicated by some of the reviews found here.  Some of the scenes are nice, but the editing and transfer leave much to be desired.  The music also, is not a good fit in my opinion.  If you are looking for an exceptional musical travelogue of Ireland, I would highly recommend ""Portrait of Ireland"" featuring James Galway, Enya and the Chieftains.  It has excellent cinematography with great music to scenery match.",1160179200,18,449,4.792207792207792
2208307,2,B0007CILL6,"I ordered this DVD due to the good reviews. Well, that was a mistake. This DVD is a sloppy transfer from the VHS version which was filmed in the 1990's. The scenery of course is spectacular, but there are zigs, zags, white lines, jumpy camera scenes and a few skips mostly during the 2nd half of the show. Having just returned from Ireland, I popped in one of our own video's and it looks more professional and better edited than this DVD. Kultur Video's turn out to be poor quality.",1156723200,16,483,4.377777777777778
2208308,5,B0007CILL6,The video offers magnificent views of Ireland's colorful countryside.  It is an excellent video with wonderful Irish music.,1154822400,,123,5.833333333333333
2208309,4,B0007CILL6,"Beautiful scenery, beautiful music. It is a pity that there is no commentary.",1126569600,11,77,5.0
2208310,5,B0007CILL6,"This DVD is exactly what it says it is - magnificent scenery. They don't bother telling you what hotel to stay in, what the people are like in this town or that, or what year this church was built. Rather, it is almost a music video of Ireland. Set to wonderful music, this DVD gives you a look at many of the most beautiful places to be seen in Ireland. At a time when travel has become more difficult, or you want to relive a visit, this can be very welcome indeed.",1125273600,20,467,4.086956521739131

8046698,5,B0007CILL6,This DVD was so beautiful to watch. We were going to Ireland and wanted to watch some scenery and it's a beautiful DVD.,1256688000,,119,4.217391304347826
8046699,2,B0007CILL6,"The service provided by all in the purchase and delivery of this item was exemplary. It arrived more quickly than I expected, and the purchase was seamless.  The product itself is a disappointment. I have seen an hour-long video of Ireland which is all aerial views, shot apparently from a helicopter, and covering most of Ireland, with beautiful accompaning music track. I was hoping that this was that tape; alas, this is not that tape. This tape is largely shot from the ground, has a fair number of still shots, and the music track is not as good as the one I hoped for.",1251590400,,574,4.519230769230769
8046700,3,B0007CILL6,"the images & video are really pretty good, but there needs to be some kind of narrating or something. it's split up into areas of ireland, but other than that u really dont' know what ur looking at. it seems like ur just waiting for some information",1244678400,,249,4.319148936170213
8046701,5,B0007CILL6,I bought three dvd's and this one was the best and most vivid photography.  I was in Ireland for two weeks in May.  I am now home sick...,1222732800,,137,3.857142857142857
8046702,2,B0007CILL6,"I purchased the DVD with the hope of viewing parts of Ireland that my wife and I had not yet had the opportunity to see on vacation.  We recognized places we had been, but the lack of audio or text does not give you and clue as to where the beautiful location is or how you may find out more about it.  Would not recommend if you were looking for a DVD that provides information or insight on planning a trip.  Great if you want to see how beautiful Ireland is and listen to some elevator music.  Could not watch the entire DVD at approx. 60 minutes, just too boring.",1199318400,2,567,4.127272727272727
8046703,3,B0007CILL6,"This DVD is exactly what its title claims: scenery of Ireland.  Yes, the video is magnificent!  But it would have been much more meaningful to someone who's never been there before to know more specifically what he/she is looking at. The video is divided into 4 areas of Ireland. Captions or a voiced description would have been helpful. With every move of the mouse, the video re-starts which is aggravating, and makes it difficult to utilize the control buttons at the bottom of the screen.",1199145600,2,492,4.776470588235294
8046704,5,B0007CILL6,This was a gift for my parents and they thoroughly enjoyed it.,1168819200,5,62,4.25
8046705,4,B0007CILL6,"The views picked are some of the best of Ireland.  However, since it was recorded on a VHS tape and then transfered to DVD, it does have that fuzzy quality like VHS tapes.  If you can get by that, you will love the scenery.",1167782400,8,223,4.045454545454546
