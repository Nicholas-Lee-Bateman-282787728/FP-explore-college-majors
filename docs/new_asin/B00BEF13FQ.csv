One can say that it is some sort of a companion to Debussy's opera ""Pell&eacute;as & M&eacute;lisande"", conducted by  Franz Welser-M&ouml;st  at Z&uuml;rich Opera House.",1454284800,,318,5.469387755102041
8566950,4,B00BEF13FQ,"In addition to the wonderful music that is The Planets, a great rendition and the excellent recording sound, the main subject of this performance is the experiment combining visual and sound.  The experiment was designed as a visual/sound display in a Museum. The documentary Making of gives a detailed explanation of the purpose of the recording. Without it you can easily ask yourself why the big fuzz about the recording.  Once you understand the purpose and context the judgment is easier. As technology advances and keeps changing, I salute the efforts of the Philharmonia Orchestra to experiment with the combination of great audio and visual effects.  Did the experiment succeed?  I am not to judge it and time will tell if this was a seminal work or one more step in how music is presented to audiences. What is clear that technology is changing how we enjoy music, and thus my kudos to Salonen for keep pushing the boundaries.  I strongly recommend this Blu-ray which, in addition to being a pleasure to hear, will certainly trigger some thoughts on what we understand a performance is.",1395964800,3,1095,4.897297297297297
8566951,4,B00BEF13FQ,"Let me start out by listing what is on this Blu-ray.

Gustavus Theodore von Holst - The Planets composed of:

Mars, the Bringer of War
Venus, the Bringer of Peace
Mercury, the Winged Messenger
Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity
Saturn, The Bringer of Old Age
Uranus, the Magician
Neptune, the Mystic

The companion piece:
Worlds, Stars, Systems, Infinity - by Joby Talbot

I would have liked to have seen each Planet have its own camera angles to choose from on separate discs.  Being able to choose from which angle to view the people playing.  Also, the ability to isolate only that particular instrument and blocking out the others.  They would probably have to record each instrument played individually to accomplish this.  Currently the recording is all instruments combined so there is no separation.  This would have been the epitome of the use of all those HD cameras and Mics.  Having the Mic closely focused on each instrument would have opened up another level of HD fidelity and realism.  I'm not sure where the Mics were placed but I assume they would place it at the conductor's location.

Also they had shots of specific performers but they decided the only viewing angle is to place 4 of them in their own little window playing simultaneously.  There is nothing wrong with that but I would have liked to option to view each performer in full HD of my choosing as well so I can see each performer up close and HD.

Granted adding these new features may increase the Planets Blu-ray size to perhaps at least 8 solid Blu-ray discs.  The current format holds about 18GB of the total capacity.  If they used 50GB capacity Blu-ray discs they would accomplish this.  I would say there is a lot of unused HD footage they could have easily packed into this gem.

I found these planets to be of great interest:
Mars
Venus
Jupiter
Neptune

But by far, the top two is Mars and Neptune for me.
Also, Joby Talbot's ""Worlds, Stars, Systems, Infinity"" is quite amazing as well and fits with Holst's The Planets theme.

If I were to listen to this in a concert, I would just have these three pieces only.  The others I felt could be left out but that is just personal preference.

Since this is my first Blu-ray audio which happens to contain video, I feel this is a good purchase for anyone wishing to have an idea of how an orchestra looks up close while performing one of the Holst's greatest masterpiece stolen by many composers for Star Trek, Star Wars, Gladiator, and many other movie themes totally recognizable today.

Some of the issues with the Blu-ray Planet chapters are the separation and ending of the cuts.  Sometimes the beginnings are not cut with enough lead in time and the ending blends into the next section.

I wish they had recorded each Planet beginning to end with dead silence in front and after rather than a continuous flow to the next section.  In the beginning of the Mars chapter, the orchestra is warming up before the conductor walks onto stage and they start playing immediately.  I would have preferred that for the Mars chapter they skipped to the moment preceding him standing on stage but after the warm up noises had subsided.  Another chapter designated ""Warm-up"" preceding ""Mars"" would have been appropriate here.

One reviewer complained about Neptune's angel voices at the end being abruptly cut going into Joby Talbot's companion piece.  Also the people responsible for the angel voices are not seen anywhere on the main viewpoint.  I'll have to check if they are on the other viewpoints but I was curious why they were not included in the main footage as I had thought they were using instruments to artificially make those sounds.

[To summarize what they should do is release an Extended Edition of this with the following features:]

Each Planet has silence at the beginning and end for a proper isolation of the musical piece.

Video and audio recording of each instrument individually as well as each performer - Time consuming but well worth it.

Include the extra multiple viewing angles used by the 37 HD cameras to choose from.  If this increased the Blu-ray discs for each planet so be it.

One angle they could include is a conductor's viewpoint wide angle shot of the orchestra and a small window at the very top center for the conductor's front facing body but mirroring the image so that the conducting would match what he was doing on stage again as if you were staring at his back side.  This would allow the viewer to see what the conductor was doing and seeing the orchestra perform simultaneously.

Hiring Joby Talbot to compose Planet ""Earth"" and the dwarf planet ""Pluto"".

Lastly a Final cut disc that includes all the isolated channels of each instrument which can be chosen on screen by your remote during the execution of the performance in real time.  Obviously, you'd have to have a page with all the instruments shown that you could choose up to 7 of those instruments to be piped on each individual channel you selected or play the same instrument on all 7 channels for that isolated experience.  I would love to be able to isolate each instrument close up and hear the clarity rather than a combined instrumental from a distance on 7.2 Channel DTS-HD Master Audio.  To me there also seemed to be a lack of bass in the recordings because they were perhaps simply not isolated audio recordings and I am sure those large drums would have sounded wonderful through my subwoofer.  If they had been given such treatment along with all the other bass heavy instruments it would have brought out that rich purity and authenticity and would rival the London Science Museum's experience.

This would be the perfect musical score to perform such a feat.

I would say a fair price for this item given its deficiencies is a $15 price point.

A 4.0 of 5.0 stars is more than fair.  Although realistically it should be 3.5 stars and if they released the Extended Edition as I stated in detail, then it would be treated with a 5.0 star rating and a price point between $35-$50 depending how thorough they followed the Extended Edition to my requirements.

Anyone looking for a first Blu-ray audio/video to test out their surround system would enjoy this.  But I am sure there are much better Blu-rays to use but nothing with the amount of varied instruments found on this disc.  If they release my Extended Edition version it would be the ultimate surround sound Blu-ray demo.",1395878400,3,6431,4.697321428571429
8566952,5,B00BEF13FQ,"My reference version is Eugene Ormandy's 1977 version. You can get it here: http://www.amazon.com/Holst-Planets-Debussy-Philadelphia-Orchestra/dp/B0012L2KC2/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1390591705&sr=1-1&keywords=ormandy+planets
There is a breathtaking quality to some of quiet passages. Leonard Bernstein's version struck me as a sweaty apartment super banging on pipes with a huge pipe wrench.

This version is also very well conducted and the presentation is unique with dozens of HD cameras letting you see who is doing what. After hearing this piece hundreds of times, it was a revelation.  100% perfect? No...but very watchable.

The commentaries are four of the musicians talking to each other as the piece plays. Very inside baseball, but fascinating. One of the interesting comments was because this was shot on a soundstage, and the various parts of the orchestra were draped to isolate them for the cameras, visual clues as to other musicians getting ready were unavailable to them. So they realized that not only do they watch the conductor, but the other musicians as well.

I bought this after seeing a segment on Classic Arts Showcase. It's free to cable companies, so ask for it if it's not on in your area.",1390521600,,1229,5.591397849462366
8566953,3,B00BEF13FQ,"I settled on a mid-point rating because of the alteration of the final movement of The Planets. As written, ""Neptune"" is, in the words of the composer's daughter Imogen, ""unforgettable, with its hidden chorus of women's voices growing fainter and fainter... until the imagination knew no difference between sound and silence"". However, contrary to the implication in the product's description that ""the filmed performance also includes a new commission by UK composer Joby Talbot, Worlds, Stars, Systems, Infinity,"" new piece actually overlaps the final notes of the chorus, thus ruining the effect. Over the years, I've listened The Planets in various recordings innumerable times, but after enjoying what had been a respectable and well-recorded performance, I found this incredibly jarring. A major disappointment for me.",1389225600,5,824,5.6
8566954,4,B00BEF13FQ,"Very informative.  Looks great sounds great.  Used in high school music classroom several times.  Highly recommended.  Would have liked to have seen more features in the DVD.

8566955,4,B00BEF13FQ,"This disc celebrates more than Holst's Planets suite as its very title suggests. Another main clue lies in the much advertised number of 37 cameras used for the production. This disc is really an extension of the Universe of Sound project and audio visual experience put on in London's Museum of Science in 2012. This was an attempt to engage with the attending 'audience' members by providing a wrap-round experience of being within an orchestra at the time of its playing. Furthermore there were interactive options to find out what it feels like to conduct the orchestra by using linked software.

This was a very major initiative and investment in terms of cost, time and technology and seems to have been very successful. The next project concerns the Rite of Spring.

For purchasers of this disc there are various extras but this does not include the interactive conducting. There is the option to watch and hear a descriptive documentary which gives a musical listening guide to each planet while the music plays. This will be both interesting and informative for newcomers especially. Of less obvious educational value but entertaining the first time, is the option to hear section leaders chatting about and commenting on their practical experiences as the music plays. There is also the option to have a picture insert within the main picture showing the players' view of the conductor during the performance. Again, I would suspect of little repeat value.

The most likely option will be to simply choose to watch the performance in the normal way. This will not be the normal view however, and that is where the 37 cameras come in as they are positioned in such a way as to try and replicate the sensation of being within the orchestra. In practical terms this usually means frequent inter-cutting to show players in isolated close-up as they are featured thematically as the music progresses. This rapid change from player to player, incorporating some unusual angles on the way, could be both tiring for some viewers and disruptive to the concentration on the whole for others. One solution would be to listen rather than watch for a better purely musical experience. At that point one may wonder why a CD would not do just as well.

Moving on to the performance: Salonen conducts a very 'traditional' reading where all tempi are absolutely within the normal expected range. The setting is of a 'studio' type where the players, dressed in standard concert attire, are set against a black background. Sophisticated lighting and high definition cameras ensure that detail is consistently of an excellent standard and that the players, dressed in black suits or dresses, do not get lost by merging into the black background. There is no audience so there is something of a sterile feel to the 'performance' and interaction between players in the form of shared glances etc. is almost non-existent. The playing itself is of a totally excellent and very professional nature. This would make a very good study disc for those following a score or wishing to study the construction of the music sonically.

On a sound level, this disc delivers the sort of excellence that one would expect of Mike Hatch where everything is exceptionally clear and well-balanced. Again, an excellent disc for studying the score. Comments read elsewhere about the lack of impact as regards the bass drum did not appear to apply to my equipment which extends to below audibility and certainly delivers on drums of any sort plus low organ etc. This particular sound reproduction issue may be as much to do with conductor choice or my own satisfaction with this level of impact. The choir and organ were recorded at other times and in other venues and have been expertly incorporated into the sound mix. We don't get to see the choir during the performance which seems a little odd, if understandable in the circumstances.

The final bars of Neptune take us directly into a continuation piece by Joby Talbot entitled Worlds, Stars, Systems, Infinity. This works well as a composition and makes a viable and reasonable extension to Holt's own creation. However, by being so joined as a continuous piece, it means that those not sympathetic to Talbot's vision or those simply wishing to enjoy the Planets as written by Holst are denied that option.

In summary I would suggest that this interesting disc works very well on its own terms but that its own terms will compromise the musical experience for some viewers. There is a lack of communication between players and between audience and players that the best real concert recordings can supply. There will be too much camera hyperactivity for some and not enough overall views (in fact, none). The bonus features are of limited appeal, certainly for repeat viewing but that is also true of most other audio/video discs. The actual recording of both the visuals and the sound is exceptionally clear and precise within its own parameters.

This is a fine disc sonically, but so are many others on standard CD format. At that point it would be fair to point out that many of those are more than a match for this in terms of character and implied performance. I personally enjoy those by Sargent, Boult, Previn and Gardiner in no particular order and find them very rewarding both as musical and aural experiences.

This disc represents fair value but still leaves room for a recording to take precedence at some time in the future which will combine high quality recording standards with a real sensation of a 'live' event of note.

........................................

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

--"" interaction between players in the form of shared glances etc. is almost non-existent""

Because of the way it was recorded, each section of the orchestra was isolated, visually, from each of the others by dividers (which is also why there aren't overall views). Some of the performers indeed comment that it made them aware just how many of their cues they take, not from the conductor, but from movements (especially drumsticks coming down!) in other sections of the orchestra. So it's not surprising that you're seeing a lack of visual interaction between the players because, outside of their own sections, they couldn't *see* the other players.

I think given such limitations, it's inevitable that this performance will struggle to match other recordings in terms of character or emotional impact - but that's the price for getting this degree of technical insight into the workings of an orchestra in such a glorious piece of music.
