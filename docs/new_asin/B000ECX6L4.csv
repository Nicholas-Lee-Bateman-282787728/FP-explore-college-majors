8108377,4,B000ECX6L4,"This item is good. I still need information about title of the music, some music really beautiful. Could you give that information for me?",1395532800,,138,4.791666666666667
8108378,4,B000ECX6L4,"This series  has been very useful and challenging for me as a middle aged  woman returning to dance after  40  years.  The 101 & 201  had been a  great way  to recondition my mind and body at home before attempting a live  class.  The 201  is a  nice challenge to learn new  routines. I  would have liked a  different  barre  warm up in 201since  it is the same as  the first 101 & 201. I  would definitely  recommend  this series,  and would love to see more.",1366502400,,460,4.093023255813954
8108379,5,B000ECX6L4,This instruction on this DVD is very detailed.  Jennifer Nunes is gorgeous to watch and after following her instruction I can now perform the same moves.  I would highly recommend this for beginners who are happy to put in the work needed.,1349308800,,239,4.666666666666667
8108380,1,B000ECX6L4,"I purchased the Ballet 101 & 201 combo pack thinking it would go into details about terminology for each poses and steps but it did not. It is good for someone who already has foundations on terminologies and steps and choriagraphies of ballet.
The instructor is very graceful and executes every move beautifully. I wanted to send it back after one time use but due to opened package,I would have to pay the restock fee plus shipping so do your homework on this item before you purchase. I would lose more money by sending it back on shipping charge and restock fee so I am keeping mine or give it to a friend.",1271376000,,610,4.407079646017699
8108381,5,B000ECX6L4,"For beginners, these videos are great!  I started with 101 & 201 then moved on to the combinations.  This really helped me start ballet now in a real classroom.",1268006400,,160,4.482758620689655

8108383,5,B000ECX6L4,"""What a great video! This one is a lot of fun. I enjoy  learning the waltz and all the other dances. With this video, you gain flexibility that can be very useful for other sports. Also, the lovely music, the calm and peaceful voice of the teacher make you forget about work, stress and exams. A special thank you to all the persons who create this video and the 3 other ones.""",1150156800,5,377,4.236111111111111
8108384,5,B000ECX6L4,"I'm in my 40s, and I wanted to dance. Using this video, I do just that.  What I like about it that made me want to write a review is that it has a very relaxing feeling to it.  It is beautifully done, and the instruction is easy to understand. I am just a beginner, and I have been able to use this series with very little difficulty. I'm not saying it isn't challenging, because it is.  I am grateful for some of the slo-motion on the new steps and the dance pieces, but I am soooo very proud of myself when I complete a dance. I have all 3 videos (Ballet 101, 201 and Combinations) and I am a very happy customer.",1034553600,6,615,3.983739837398374
