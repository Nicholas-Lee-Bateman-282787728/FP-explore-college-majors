Ana Laguna is an unattractive, older Carmen, not nearly as youthful or attractive as Pompea Santoro, Micaela.  Much of the dancing seems crude.  Much aimless running around the stage.  Doesn't seem to follow the story which is okay if it held up on its own terms.  That said, I liked it once, find it crude, boring and repellant this time around!",1514764800,,458,4.6625
7963779,5,B0000687DZ,"A quick word to add to the plaudits already said- this is a tour de force of dance. The sheer exhilaration energy and potency
of this interpretation is exciting and refreshing with Ana Laguna just superb! Bravo all round without caveats-any minor niggles are
completely overcome by the quality and skill of the whole Company and thank goodness we have it recorded and available on dvd (and
we can only imagine how good it would be on blu-ray?!).",1329177600,,445,4.717948717948718
7963780,5,B0000687DZ,"Mat Eks' Carmen ballet is a psychologically probing and at the same time highly amusing.  It depicts the story from Jose's point of view, beginning with him facing the firing squad, then dissolving into his life with Carmen.

In this soldier's tale, his ""lieutenant"" is distinguished by his moustache.  The mustached soldier leads his men with an officiousness and absurdity reminiscent of Monty Python's ""crazy walks.""  This leader is but one rival for Carmen's attentions.  Her prior lover, only hinted at in the opera, seems a serious and recurrent rival here.  And then, of course, there is Escamillo.  He is handsome, flashy, and sexual.

All of the dancers perform superbly, but Ana Laguna's Carmen requires special mention.  She portrays a spectacular, powerful, and highly sexual Carmen; it is also a Carmen who is intentionally shown without beauty or grace.  Carmen is too controlling, too independent as Jose recalls her to have even a hint of delicacy.  She contrasts superbly with Jose's view of Micaela:  dutiful, caring, tireless, and dull.  But there is nothing dull about this ballet.",1130544000,6,1101,5.1525423728813555
7963781,5,B0000687DZ,"Mats Ek has done it again! I've watched this ballet about 10 times over and have never stopped loving it. Because of this ballet, I fell in love with the Shchedrin version of ""Carmen"". Marc Hwang (Jose) and Ana Laguna (Carmen) delivered  exceptional performances, to say the least. I cannot think of any dancers who fit the roles as well as they did. The choreography was definitely one of its kind, and brings the viewer into a refreshing new world. I'm glad that I was able to see it on dvd where not a single gesture or facial twitch was missed. A DEFINITE MUST for all modern ballet lovers, and a great buy for anyone who is even mildly interested in dance. You need to see it to believe it.",1056240000,7,695,4.346153846153846
