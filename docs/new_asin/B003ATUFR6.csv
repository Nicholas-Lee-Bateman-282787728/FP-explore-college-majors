4104615,5,B003ATUFR6,I use this for my bad hip and it's the most amazing thing ever! I started with just tennis balls but I soon did buy her yoga tune up balls. Either are just fine for this dvd. If you have issues with your body this woman is a saint.,1389225600,7,231,3.7346938775510203
4104616,5,B003ATUFR6,"I mostly use the hip and lower back routines, sometimes doing both the 5 and 10 minute ones back to back. It's not always fun while you're doing it (I don't particularly enjoy sidewinders, for instance) but it really does provide relief for tight hips and lower back pain right away.",1371254400,10,283,4.568627450980392
4104617,5,B003ATUFR6,"Very easy to follow.  Helped with my back pain within a few days after
using this video.  This one is a keeper!",1366934400,9,111,4.0
4104618,4,B003ATUFR6,I had had some foot problems from overuse with all the exercise I do.  I do the foot portion of this tape and it does help.  I personally don't think this is for beginners.  I've been doing yoga and other workouts at home for years and am happy with the instruction on this video.,1365552000,9,280,4.148148148148148
4104619,5,B003ATUFR6,"Absolutely one of the best things I've found in the hundred exercise videos an DVDs. Short, to the point and easy to do on your own. Great cueing, friendly without being cloyingly so. Give it a whirl.",1363478400,8,200,4.4324324324324325
4104620,5,B003ATUFR6,"I have mainly used the lower back section, and I must say its the best thing I have ever done!! I am a pretty active person, I run, bike, lift weights etc...I had a slipped disc a few years back, I went to the chiropracter with no relief. I just worked through the pain, I tried strenthening my back, stretching, massages etc with virtually no difference in the pain. I assumed that my next step was to meet with a doctor about surgery. I did some last ditch surfing on the internet for some yoga specifically for back pain and stumbled upon this DVD, after reading the reviews I bought this and after doing the 5 minute quick fix for the first time I noticed immediate relief in my back... and after doing the 5 minute and the 15 minute sectiom for several weeks, my pain is almost 100% gone!!!! I do notice that if I slack a little and skip the workouts my back stiffens up again, but not the pain that I had been experiencing previously!! If you have back pain buy this DVD and DO IT!!! It was a life changer for me!!!",1358121600,28,1021,4.214285714285714
4104621,5,B003ATUFR6,"I am totally enamoured of this DVD.  Jill Miller is a genius, and she has my everlasting gratitutde for producing this series.  I had bought the three yoga link DVDs but found them a little daunting - even though I regularly practice pilates and quite regularly practice yoga.  I suffer from tightness in my right hip/top of leg, and left inner thigh and hip flexor - which not only hurt but make me walk funny too!  I also have very tight shoulders and chest and a painful neck - and painful elbows too! - probably because of computer and knitting and sewing..... I bought this and the upper body DVD and tried them both yesterday. WOW!  I haven't felt this good for a long long time - loose, open, straight, stretched out.  They are feasible for everyone - even my very unfit and tight shouldered sister.  The relief I felt is incredible.  Now, I normally do pilates at least three times a week, and afterwards do a short yoga session of around 25 minutes to relax me and stretch out the weak spots.  This is so much better.  I ended up doing all the quickfixes - the short 5 minute and the longer (10 minutes only!) for each section - because they felt so wonderful!  Her self massage techniques are incredible.  The stretches and strengtheners in these DVDs are practically all unique - and this is someone with an enormous collection of DVDs talking here, people (at least 300... ahem).  The sessions are so well thought out.  And she also has a cute sense of humour, which helps.....

HIGHLY recommended.  If you have any sort of pain, tightness or discomfort anywhere in your body - or you want to insure against the aging process - if you work with PCs, do any kind of handwork, suffer from tension or stress - in other words, everyone!",1289433600,71,1744,4.488888888888889
4104622,5,B003ATUFR6,Bought this and the Yoga Tune Up Balls.  Works all of the kinks out of your body.  I feel so relaxed after using this workout.  I sit all day for work and cannot wait to get home to use this!!!,1433376000,2,193,3.775
4104623,4,B003ATUFR6,"I read Jill Miller's ""Roll Model"" book and wanted a video demonstrating those techniques in more depth.  At first I was disappointed b/c the The Quick Fix video is exercise oriented with only a short ball section at the end.
That being said ... now that I started using the video ... I LOVE it.

It does exactly what is says:  you can tune-up your low back or hips in just 5 minutes.  Her format works and it is different than ""all the other stuff"" out there.  I am a retired professional dancer and have many old injuries and inflammation issues from repetitive use syndrome which manifests as pain in my low back and hips.  Doing even the 5-minute routine and another 5 minutes on the balls afterwards reduces my pain significantly.  The fast format makes it ideal to mix-in with a fuller work-out.  For example I dance for 45 minutes (which usually leaves me sore due to all the injuries and inflammation) but then I finish with this video as a cool-down and the results are amazing.  Pain reduces from 20% - 50%.  I have been able to decrease pain meds.  Only I deducted 1 star b/c I wish she said this at the beginning:
To get the most from this video, have a blanket or beach towel, a yoga mat or 2 (if you need extra padding), a strap, and 2 yoga blocks.",1431648000,8,1261,4.323404255319149
4104624,5,B003ATUFR6,"This is more of a physical therapy session than a yoga practice, but you will definitely get something new out of it. She's one of the best!",1427587200,3,140,4.222222222222222
4104625,5,B003ATUFR6,"I absolutely love this Quickfix DVD...I feel like I have a new lower body when I have completed this series.  I also have the Quickfix DVD for the Upper Body and I love that one just as much.  A Quickfix and yet so effective...it actually does work...some of the movements are quite painful at first; however, when gently working through them, it pays off and you will feel so much better, I know I do.",1422057600,3,402,4.346666666666667
4104626,2,B003ATUFR6,I got rid of this DVD. It was too slow and boring.,1420848000,,50,3.25
4104627,5,B003ATUFR6,"I love all of her dvds. She's brilliant in her work. It feels so good during and after the excercises. I have all of her dvds and take turn in using them. I have middle and lower back and neck disc issues caused by multiple accidents, which the neck pain also triggers migraine. The upper back tune up dvd relieves the migraines or often prevents them from happening, if I do the work as soon as I have stiff neck. These are seriously must haves in today's life style. She is wonderful. Such a pro!",1418169600,5,498,4.252631578947368

4104629,5,B003ATUFR6,"Jill Miller produces excellent yoga videos geared toward one part of your body. She will take the knowledge that you already have, and build on it in some small surprising way.

8393177,4,B003ATUFR6,"Love the exercises, as well as how Jill carefully explains how each exercise impacts a specific part of the lower body. I feel much better after doing them, and I get at least 2-3 hours of relief. At 67, I can't do all the exercises, at least not yet, but that will be my goal. I gave a 4 rather than 5 star rating only because the balls I bought were too hard for me to use. Quite painful.",1497312000,,390,3.949367088607595

8393179,5,B003ATUFR6,Not as much yoga as stretching but it's just what I needed for my lower back and feet pain.  I have plantar faciitis and what is critical is stretching legs and feet.  This is just want I was looking for.,1490486400,,204,4.075

8393182,5,B003ATUFR6,"Very simple and straight forward.  Have had lower back left hip joint pain for years. Progressively tightening even though I did stretches.
Of course, they were what was taught to me when in high school.  I have pain walking down or up steps.  I have no physical damage,
but one MD said I should expect it having played sports in high school and been in two car accidents.
Chiropractor wanted to fix me with 12 visits but alas I don't have that money.

Gladly, the video divides  up into various problem areas.  I did the five minute hip joint.  And, I felt much better.  So I did the ten minute routine,
felt a little better.  Surprised how simple movements opened up the joint.  An hour later, went for a walk and was again surprised
how much mobility I regained in both hips.  It was amazing.  No pain.  It was as if somebody oiled my joints.
Next day, still pain free but was tighter.  Did the 5 minute exercise again.  Loosened up.
Totally satisfied with her hip joint exercise.  I intend to the rest for the lower back.  And do the hip every day, at least for 12 times.
Thank you Jill Miller.",1465084800,,1098,4.356435643564357
8393183,5,B003ATUFR6,Excellent. Really helps improve mobility. Short sections make it really easy to use more often,1462838400,,94,5.333333333333333
8393184,5,B003ATUFR6,Everyone should be doing these exercises and using these yoga tune up balls! I love the feet segment on this DVD. I like the upper body dvd even better than the lower body.,1454457600,3,172,4.242424242424242
