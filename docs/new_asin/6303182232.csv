588407,5,6303182232,"I've owned this video since 1994 and it is one that I will always keep and work out with.  Tamilee is consise in her movements.  Her direction is excellent and this video is result oriented.  I started with this video in 1994, 3x week.  Combined with step aerobics, I lost 18 pounds in 3 months.  I've come back to it, four years after back surgery, started slowly to build my core back up.  This tape is hard work, but with any exercise, as your muscles increase in strength, your workouts become easier and you feel your muscles working!  I reccommend this tape for anyone looking for a weekly ABS workout. The tape is 40 minutes broken out into sections which provide for variety during the week.  The workouts are intense enough and results oriented to keep you motiviated.  The results, if you stick to it, show up in no time!",981158400,48,831,4.486666666666666
588408,4,6303182232,"I've owned this tape for over 8 years.  This is the one I go back to when I just want a quick and thorough ab workout.  After cringing every time I heard Tamilee mispronounce ""abdominals,"" and gritting my teeth when she instructs me to place my elbows at ""11 and 2 o'clock"" (an asymmetrical position), I turned the sound off and just followed the movement.  This video will give you a good basic abdominal workout if you're a beginner or intermediate, and will be a good supplement to an advanced routine.  I find it disconcerting that someone with an advanced degree in Kinesiology (or physiology or whatever her degree is supposedly in) can't even pronounce the part of the body she's working out!  Other than the semantics though, it's a good workout.",978048000,7,754,4.681818181818182

588476,5,6303182232,"Tami makes the best ab videos. I really feel the burn when I do her ab workouts. I haven't tried the videos for other body parts, but I might. There are three workouts on this video. The first focuses mostly on upper abs. The second workout is tougher because it's aimed at lower abdominal work. The third workout has a bit of this and that. These workouts are about ten minutes if I remember right. They're short, but they really work your abs.
I bought the Best Of Tamilee Webb Abs DVD and I like it, but not as much as these classic ab workout videos of hers. The DVD has some of these moves in there, but not all and a lot of different ones. I really wish they would put this exact video and also the Abs of Steel 2 video on DVD. I would buy them in a minute.

UPDATE: THEY DO!! :) I didn't realize they have the Abs of Steel 1 & 2 on DVD because they're part of a package labeled: Buns of Steel, The Classics. Volume 1 includes Abs of Steel 1, Buns of Steel 3 I think it is, plus Arms & Abs of Steel.
Volume 2 includes Abs of Steel 2, Buns of Steel 5 I think, and Legs of Steel.
Two different DVDs with the classics. I'm so getting them!",1405900800,,1142,3.965217391304348

BUT, if you don't have that problem this is for you.  It has different levels of excercises, so there is something for the ""new ab excerciser"" and those with strong abs already.
  If your just getting started, workout 1 is the easiest and best for you, but don't be surprised if you can't get through the whole 10 minutes- it's hard, but you will see a significant increase in how much you can do within a week.

588568,5,6303182232,"I work out with Tamilee Webb almost every morning.  I have her first two abdominal exercise tapes, ABS OF STEEL and ABS OF STEEL, PART TWO.  ABS OF STEEL, the topic of this review, will ease you into daily ab workouts and improve both your health and appearance.

Tamilee Webb succeeds with ABS OF STEEL because she does not make you feel lazy or out of shape if you can't keep up with her.  Tamilee starts with a short warm-up/stretch session to get your blood flowing and muscles ready.  Then Tamilee performs the ABS OF STEEL exercise routines in three ten-minute segments.  You can do one a day but if ready for more, do a second or even all three, two options I sometimes, tee-hee, exercise.

Tamilee Webb varies the difficulty in the three ABS OF STEEL segments.  Either she does this purposely or it's a helpful matter of fate, because if you find one or two of the segments too challenging, you can still do the other(s).  FYI, the second ABS OF STEEL segment will work you the hardest; the third segment is next most challenging; and the first segment the easiest.  But as you work out with ABS OF STEEL, you will note Tamilee reminds you to take a break if you have a difficult time keeping up.

Speaking of what she may or may not be doing on purpose, Tamilee Webb wears cheeky French cut workout shorts throughout ABS OF STEEL.  In the warm-up segment, the shorts shows off a good amount of her big beautiful bottom when she rests on her stomach and also as she pulls her knees to her chest.  But(t) it gets real interesting in the third and especially the first ab workout segments, where we see several close-ups of Tamilee's bulbous behind.  Maybe Tamilee doesn't know what she's doing, or she doesn't know what the male director and camera operators are doing!  Not that I fault Tamilee Webb for not hiding how attractive she is.  At the end of the second workout segment, Tamilee even bounces her ample bosoms and lets out a breathy sigh far sexier than one would expect for an exercise instructor.

It is unfortunate that the ABS OF STEEL producers don't value you as much as Tamilee Webb does. Tamilee puts her heart and soul (as well as some other parts of her, as I previously mentioned) into teaching and encouraging you but the budget guys issued the video tape in the cheap, low-quality ""SLP"" speed, which means poor sound quality and an image that could be sharper.  And God forbid they spend a few extra dollars editing.  ABS OF STEEL seems to be a ""live"" shoot.  They let Tamilee Webb's mistakes (mostly verbal miscues) fly instead of fixing them with edits or overdubs.  Also, at the end of the first exercise routine Tamilee unwittingly continues working when she should instead finish but rather than re-shoot for ten seconds, the ABS OF STEEL producers abruptly cut to Tamilee in a different pose, where she concludes the segment.  The title of this tape is ABS OF STEEL, the boss is pinching pennies of copper.  Tamilee Webb deserves better.",1171756800,2,2973,4.578449905482041
588569,5,6303182232,"I wish someone would re-release this on DVD.  There simply is nothing else on the market that compares to the original.  I have a collection of workout videos/tapes/DVD's, and no matter what else I try, I ALWAYS come back to Tamilee's Abs of Steel for my abdominal workout.  It's AWESOME.  I love that it's broken down into 10 minute segments.  In the beginning stages, you can just choose to do one 10 minute segment.  If you're needing more, then you can do one of the others as well.  WHY OH WHY OH WHY won't they re-release this on DVD!?!?!?!  Guess I won't be getting rid of my VHS anytime soon!!!!!!1",1169856000,2,606,4.445454545454545

I hate doing abs, but this is one workout I can stick with, and it's tough! 10 minutes is the perfect amount of time (for me) to devote to abs. I can do this tape every single day and it doesn't get boring or tedious - it's just tough! I definitely recommend this tape!",1164844800,2,426,4.2592592592592595
588572,5,6303182232,This video offers a great ab workout.  I've already worn out two videos and I am now on my third tape.  I've used this video for over eight years and never get bored.

My abs really took shape. I do this tape with my other workouts for added variety. Let me tell you this is one of the best abs tape ever made. I have a lot of abs tapes that I use from the Firm,Denise Austin and others,I like them alot too. This is my favorite. It makes want to check out the other Abs of steel tapes. I think I will. You people who have not tried this yet,Let me tell. BUY IT",1152230400,,554,3.955357142857143
588574,5,6303182232,"Tamilee's abs workout is great. She provides three 10 min workouts that you alternate with. This ensures the you never plateau. Her instruction is clear and easy to follow. You even get a glut workout too. To see results, however, you must follow her program regularly. In addition, you will need to combine the abs workout with regular cardio exercise and a proper diet to really see the results of Tamilee's program. I highly recommend this workout for anyone serious about getting their abs in shape.",1142726400,2,503,4.8604651162790695
588575,3,6303182232,"With everyone noting this was a five-star video, I immediately made the purchase.  If you are a beginner, this is a great video.  However, if you workout on a regular basis, this video will not meet your needs.  I was able to get through the video with ease.  The fact that the video notes it is an, ""intense abdominal workout"" is only true if you are out of shape.",1135987200,3,365,4.246376811594203
588576,5,6303182232,"I have a ton of exercise videos, everything from yoga to pilates to abs/buns/legs to kickboxing to The Firm to etc, etc, etc. Tamilee's Abs of Steel is the only one I stuck with. I thought I was going to die the first few times I did it-- grueling work-out that hits all areas of your abs HARD. The 2nd 10-minute session is my favorite, although I couldn't do the full 10 mins when I was first starting out (I would take a few breaks throughout it, when my abs were a little TOO on fire), but soon my muscles were strong enough to handle the full session. (I would watch the VCR clock count down the 10 minutes all the way through the video in order to keep from giving up.)

I was THRILLED with the results-- I went from being a little flabby to actually being able to see my oblique muscles running down each side of my stomach. They felt like rock-hard tubes-- amazing for someone who'd never had abs before! I lost the tape during a move years ago and have not been able to find any other ab workout I liked as much, so have finally tracked down a used one and can't wait to get my hard abs back again. Tamilee's tips are accurate during the workouts (I'm a physical therapist, and bogus and/or ignorant claims in exercise tapes really drive me crazy). The background music is a little ""porn""ish, but otherwise this tape is everything it should be. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a 6-pack, or to anyone with low back problems who needs to strengthen the stomach musculature as part of their rehab.",1134950400,8,1512,4.323943661971831

588608,5,6303182232,"Okay, I absolutely hate doing any kind of ab work which of course is my biggest problem area. I do like this tape cause only have to get through 10 minutes of it at a time, it is broken down into 3-10 minute sections. So even though I do hate it, know the end is not too far away. Do like Tamilee Webb on this one, seems like I bought another one of hers and didn't like her that well, but on this one I do.

After about a month, I really did have muscular abs (I combined it with running).  Well it's 14 years later, and I decided to get into shape again.  I remembered Tammi, and so I decided to go on a hunt for the tape.  I'm doing them six days a week with one day rest.  I feel like I did 14 years ago.  She does kick your butt though.

The exercises on this tape ACTUALLY WORK if you do them. Tamilee's voice got a little annoying to me after a while, but soon I was able to do the exercises without the tape and on my own. (And I still can.) I got a great and well-toned stomach in what seemed like no time! Didn't even have to use it everyday. I think I used it every other day or like 3 times a week. I've never been overweight but I felt the need to firm up the flat tummy that I did have and so I borrowed this from my stepmom. (6 or 7 years later and I'm still borrowing it...) If you're not so slim then you'll have to use it more often than that, but I can assure you that it'll work. You can actually feel the burn in your stomach (all day) the next day after your workout.

588654,5,6303182232,This is an excellent tape if time is not a luxury yet you want a lovely midsection.  Three ten minute sessions works every part of the muscle on your middle.  I would have liked to have a warm up at the beginning on each section; it is such a pain to have to rewind the tape to warm up (if you are so inclined).  Tammy lee's cuing is great and she doesn't have an annoying condescing tone in her voice that usually accompinies most instructors. This is worth the buy.,996451200,7,467,4.166666666666667
