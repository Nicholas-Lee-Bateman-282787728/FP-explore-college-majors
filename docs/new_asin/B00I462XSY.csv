6249470,4,B00I462XSY,"I grew up on Charlie Brown. Hes as American as Apple Pie so its fitting that this new DVD is called This is America, Charlie Brown just in time for the upcoming Fourth of July Holiday and appropriate for all things Patriotic. My six year old Reed learned about Memorial Day in school last month so as soon as the DVD started he asked if it was about Memorial Day. He recognized the Patriotic theme immediately.

I have a four and a six year old and both sat down to watch this with me. I have to admit; from the get go I didn't think they would like the DVD. Its basically a really long history lesson! Fortunately, my kids love history and school so they stuck with it. All the episodes go through the history of America and while its being narrated, the Patriotic classics complete the theme. My kids did wander off here and there but when I asked if they wanted me to turn it off they said no.

When it was over they asked to watch it again. I must confess, I didn't love it because I felt like I was at school. But while in the room doing something else I would hear things and actually learn things I never knew! Its very factual and educational so it will teach your kids a lot about American History.

Each episode focuses on a different part of history: *While I didn't find it very entertaining and my kids didn't sit through the whole thing at once; they still like it enough to re-watch and I appreciate the educational value. If I can learn something from Charlie Brown, so can you! This is America Charlie Brown was an educational experience for all of us! -",1402963200,12,1571,4.282828282828283

6249508,3,B00I462XSY,"This is disappointing.  The cartoons focus to much on the history of the era/ subject they are representing and not on the kids.  They are like long winded history lessons with a little Peanuts thrown in.  They are far to preachy.  The episode about the space shuttle is the  best one.  I'll still keep it because I buy all Peanuts DVDs,  the Peanuts are my favorite,  but this is the weakest set yet.",1445904000,,401,4.397260273972603

6249510,2,B00I462XSY,"One of the reasons that we have liked the Charlie Brown series for our kids is that it is very entertaining but still very neutral.  They usually don't attempt use their cartoons to influence impressionable minds with political propaganda.  Unfortunately this otherwise good collection contains one program, The Music and Hero's of America, which is basically a propaganda video for political correctness.  It basically endorses all the talking points of left wing politics and in my opinion is a distortion of history.  If you are like us, and are trying to teach your children self-responsibility and you dislike the concept of dividing American citizens into victim groups, then I would not recommend this video.",1441497600,14,715,5.245614035087719

6249514,5,B00I462XSY,"It's true that This is America, Charlie Brown was a complete mini-series DVD set by Paramount in 2006, but quickly became rare after the WB gained control of all the Peanuts specials and series (the original 4 movies are still owned by Paramount, and all on DVD by Halloween 2015, as the new one is owned by Fox and Blue Sky Studios, the people who made the Ice Age and Rio movies). But in the summer of 2014, this mini-series' scarcity on DVD became a lot less so, when the WB rereleased it as a complete remastered mini-series collection! In fact, all 8 shows look about as great as the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection DVDs, if not more so! No matter how old you are, you'll always learn something about US history, even with this collection! From the Voyage of the Mayflower, to the US Constitution, to the Transcontinental Railroad (featuring Snoopy's brother Spike), to the Wright Brothers' First Flight, to the Smithsonian, to the NASA Space Station, and lots more, you're in for a fun & educational treat regardless of age, just like SchoolHouse Rock! This mini-series marked the first time in (USA) history that Charlie Brown's voice was done by a girl (don't believe me, Woody Woodpecker's most famous voice was done by Gracie Lantz, as Peppermint Patty and Marcie were sometimes played by boys in some of the Peanuts specials and movies), as Wikipedia mentions, and many of the grownups were played by toon legends who'd be even greater after Garfield and Friends ended; Gregg Berger & Frank Welker, and also Bill Melendez who helped with the first 2 Garfield specials alongside Lee Mendelson. In fact, one of the America episodes' singing was partly done by Lou Rawls & Desiree Goyette, whose singing was heard in all 13 original 2D Garfield specials, including the 10th anniversary special still never on DVD! Get ready for a trip in American history with the Peanuts gang, now remastered in HD, to share with your loved ones! Sadly, this set has no bonuses at all, as both discs are single-layered, even with 4 specials to each disc! Anyway... Good grief, what a set!",1437436800,6,2081,4.751381215469613
6249515,5,B00I462XSY,Love it and happy  to add this to my video library. A classic  I I recommend  for every Peanuts  fan!,1436572800,,101,3.9

Our daughter retained a great deal from the Mayflower Voyager, which we watched many times (from the Peanuts Thanksgiving DVD) so we knew she'd get a lot from the other historical pieces on this one. It's such a pleasure for us to watch, too. Some are a bit dry, but they're way cuter than the official history book, and that makes them memorable.",1421020800,4,484,4.449438202247191

6249540,5,B00I462XSY,"This is an entertaining (and educational!) look at important people and events from American History, told by Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and their friends. I purchased this dvd set several years ago and mine has different artwork on the case than what amazon advertises, but it is the same DVD's. There are 8 episodes between two discs, and each episode teaches about different people (such as Abraham Lincoln and the Wright brothers) and different events (from the writing of the U.S. Constitution to the building of an important railroad) from throughout American history.

These DVD's are fun and carry the usual 'Peanuts' charm, so they would be appropriate for younger children to watch. The educational parts of these videos would also make them appropriate for older children (or even adults) who want an introduction to a particular historical topic.

6249548,4,B00I462XSY,"This mini series was perhaps the last hurrah of the Peanuts specials, in which Charlie Brown and Snoopy and the rest take viewers on an eight episode tour of highlights in America's history (well, seven, and one look to the future, at NASA's then current plans of a manned space station, which here becomes a fun adventure for the Peanuts kids.)  There were a few more shows afterwards (as well as a few after Schulz's death), but none of them seem to be as fondly remembered or as well-publicized as This is America, Charlie Brown, making this a bit of a bittersweet success for Schulz and the Peanuts gang.  The best of these episodes put Charlie Brown and the rest into entertaining retellings of events in history, such as The Birth of the Constitution and The Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, or have the kids talking to historical figures like Alexander Graham Bell and Abraham Lincoln. Some of the episodes try to cover perhaps a bit too much material through narration by Charlie Brown and the others in episodes like The Mayflower Voyagers and The Building of the Transcontinental Railroad. The mini-series ends with a look at The Music and Heroes of America, in a co-production by Schroeder and Lucy (which was certainly NOT Schroeder's idea!) This was certainly a departure for Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez's long line of TV specials based on Schulz's famous comic strip, but for the most part they turned out well. In a few of these episodes, the drawing is a little sloppy, but not totally unwatchable, reminiscent of similar problems with The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show. There are a lot of good character moments in these shows, like Snoopy and Woodstock trying on powdered wigs in the Constitution episode, Charlie Brown loaning Ben Franklin a kite, Lucy pulling her old football gag on Charlie Brown in the NASA Space Station and a lot more...One of my favorite parts is seeing just who drove the golden spike that connected the railroads (according to Schulz, anyway) I won't spoil it here, watch it yourself!
