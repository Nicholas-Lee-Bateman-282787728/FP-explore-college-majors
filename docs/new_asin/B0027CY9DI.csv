8354573,4,B0027CY9DI,"This DVD is the exact same one as Whacked-Out Holiday, so if you already have one you don't need the other.

The episode on this DVD is a short called, ""A Christmas Caper"" It is the same episode that is on Party with the Penguins, but with different special features.

The ""Caper"" is very good, and the DVD includes commentary as well, but the problem is that it is the only episode on the DVD, otherwise it is a great DVD.",1382313600,4,423,4.209876543209877
8354574,5,B0027CY9DI,"I think this is good for all ages-children and adults.  It is just a fun series.  Fantasy yes, but of a good kind.",1368576000,,114,3.9130434782608696
8354575,5,B0027CY9DI,"Bought this after Googling for info about episodes of Penguins on Nick tv.  Saw that this had been available a couple of years ago, and the reviewer said it was now part of his classic Christmas movie collection, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  I bought it for just a few bucks, plus shipping, and we were NOT disappointed.  A couple of the voices are different (including Kowalski), but after a few minutes of adjusting to that, it was great.  Very very funny, but SHORT.  I think it's about 12 minutes long.  There are some ""bonus"" features, but nothing great.  There are some CD rom features too, if you pop it into your computer, so check those out too.

If you love the Penguins show on TV, you should add this to your collection, but don't pay too much, again, it's very very short.",1250553600,26,790,4.363013698630137
