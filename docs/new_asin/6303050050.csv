542936,3,6303050050,"The Bible merely reports that the Queen of Sheba, hearing of King Solomon's wisdom, visited him for an education. Of course many traditions say more. In this film Sheba (Gina Lollobrigida) asks Solomon (Yul Brynner) for private lessons, with predictable results. The only direct contradiction to Biblical accounts is Solomon letting his no-good brother Adonijah live long after their father David's death -- forgivable fudging, since George Sanders as Adonijah is too entertaining to kill early on. Less forgivable is the scripting of Abishag (Marisa Pavan) as a total innocent when the Bible is pretty clear about her job: trying to help the aging David regain his sexual potency. Also, while some of the big-screen scenes are technically on par with contemporary Hollywood sword-and-sandal epics, others are definitely not, and the anachronous Star of David decor is annoying.",1444262400,,878,5.369565217391305

543066,3,6303050050,"Solomon and Sheba is a biblical romantic epic that is based from the events chronicled the events of the ninth and tenth chapters of the First Book Of Kings and Second Chronicles respectively. The theme of the movie differs substantially from Biblical sources and is highly fictionalized story written by Crane Wilbur. In it,we have the the Queen of Sheba as an ally of ancient Egypt in opposition to King Solomon of Israel with whom she is having a love affair.

Too bad that the movie somewhat failed to live into its expectation as Brynner looks weak in his portrayal as King Solomon. He fails to create a believable chemistry with Lollobrigida,who showcases a lot of wit and intelligence as Sheba. Added to that,it was slow in pacing despite having great spectacles such as the battle of the Egyptians and Israelites which would definitely entertain the viewer.",1417737600,,865,4.884353741496598

543071,5,6303050050,"Yul Brynner with hair! This seems to fascinate many but there are more films out there with him sporting a quaff than you might expect!  As a Biblical story this is worthy of your collection, although not spot on accurate not many are. As a Sword & Sandal film or Action movie this will satisfy!  I hear many reviews stating this movie is more important for the loss of Tyrone Powers but I think this is a highly unfair assessment!  I had no idea Mr. Powers passed away while filming this movie so I enjoyed it for what it is & I think everyone involved did a great job!!!  Whether your into the Biblical aspects or not this is a good action movie!  As a period piece it has some good battle tactics & doesn't lack for action.  I think lovers of Sword & Sandal, Historical, Biblical, & Action Adventures would be happy to add this one to their collections!  I do have a love for the older epics because they didn't depend on billion dollar special effects to carry the film but relied on acting and story lines & good plots! This movie has all of that & can be enjoyed by the whole family as the violence isn't excessive & the language is articulate not relying on the F-bomb to make up for intelligent dialogue!  Now I don't consider myself a prude but I am getting a little tired of the lack of morality these days. I see animated cartoons on T.V. that are so crude & promoting ignorance that I would hope there are still family's out there that would want to add a movie like this to their collections!",1414713600,3,1505,4.293286219081272
543072,2,6303050050,"I generally have a life, so I don't often have time to write reviews, so this will be short: there is a reason you've never heard of this film; its because it doesn't deserve to be remembered.  Yes, it has legendary stars, but having (regretfully) purchased it to see it, I can only hope that I can recoup the loss by donating it as ""brand new"".  I pride myself as an enthusiast that can value the essence of what others wouldn't give the time of day to; I have to admit that this isn't worth the time of day.  If, however, you are interested, I am donating it, amongst a large list of other items, to the Housing Works in New York City.  Best fortune!

Of course George Sanders has the villain's role as Solomon's older jealous brother who does everything to make himself the king over Solomon.  George is usually the villain.
The pagan dance must have given the censors fits at the time this was released.  It really is terrific to watch as it's performance initiates God's punishment on Solomon.",1388275200,,523,4.842696629213483

543201,5,6303050050,"Biblical accuracy or inaccuracy aside, ""Solomon and Sheba"" is a character study about how even the wisest of men can come undone under the right seductress.  With Gina Lolabrigida as Sheba, among other fine performances, one witnesses the drama of Solomon's excesses well-played out by Brunner, and how deviating from God's plan can ruin more than just your own life, but those of others, as well.  Brunner's portrayal of a man so enraptured by a woman determined to bring him down will have you wanting to ask you pastor about the real theme behind the Song of Solomon.  A must for those who doubt Pierre Trudeau-like Solomon's Biblical worth -- and a good test for your faith.

Great in the sense that this is a reminder that back in the 50's biblical epics were taken seriously, as solid entertainment. The production is beautiful-gorgeous massive sets-even if it's very obvious that they are sets. And there is lots of spectacle(the final battle scene is a sight to behold) and plenty of religious fervor and vengeance. But the real reason for my writing this is the quality of the DVD. This is one of the best DVD's I have ever seen. the picture is as clear as if it had just been made and the colors are sharp and bright throughout. I have the widescreen version on VHS and debated whether or not to replace it-I am really glad I did. They simply cannot compare. One comment: it is a shame that the great score by Mario Nascimbebe is not available on a compact disc(With the exception of a horrible sounding import where it is paired with ""This Vikings""-avoid this disc if you ever see it). Nascimbene was a truly innovative composer for this genre and his music deserves to be heard.",1265760000,5,1166,4.47887323943662

543365,4,6303050050,"Solomon and Sheba, a 1959 offering from United Artists, gave the movie audiences of the world a glimpse into the Golden Age of Israel.  King David entrusted the united kingdom of Israel to his young son Solomon.

Of course, this did not sit well with Solomon's half brother, Adonijah who was the eldest.  The contrast between the two sons was striking-Solomon was a poet and a peaceful soul; Adonijah was a warrior ever looking to fulfill his bloodlust. He was only happy when his sword dripped with blood.

The film shows the building of Solomon's Temple, a marvel of industry for the time.  Meanwhile, Adonijah and Joab, David's nephew, secretly plotted to seize the throne.

Down the road in Egypt, the Pharaoh plotted with the Queen of Sheba to overthrow Solomon.  He feared the united kingdom of Israel and its ever increasing military presence as well as the lost of trade.  In the final analysis, war usually results from economic factors.

Everyone wanted to travel to Jerusalem to see the magnificent city of Jerusalem with its Temple and Solomon's palace.  Also, they yearned to hear the words of wisdom from Solomon that had given him global renown.

When the Queen of Sheba arrives in Jerusalem, she brings her vast caravan with expensive gifts for the King as well as her gods which she hoped would lead to his downfall.  The Queen was an intoxicating beauty which a god would be unwilling to resist.

Yul Brynner and Gina Lollobrigida give two stellar performances.  The Spanish cinematography is beautifully filmed.

The wrath of Jehovah on the Temple as the result of Solomon's sin is awe-inspiring. The climax battle between Solomon and Adonijah leading the Egyptian army is spectacular. The stoning of the Queen of Sheba at the ruins of the Temple is poignant.

One has to keep in mind that these biblical film epics are loosely based on the Bible and other sacred texts.  Regardless of this technicality, it is a great film if this is a genre that you enjoy.

The dialogue has been criticized for being too wordy, too poetic.  Keep in mind this was 1959, not 2009.  Actors and viewers were expected to be readers of the written word.",1244246400,19,2152,4.764864864864865

I wish MGM or whatever corporation did the DVD production had pulled out some more of the Tyrone Power footage (shot before his death 2/3 of the way through filming) and added it to the bonuses.  Since the film itself does not have the greatest reputation, I would think that the addition of some cinematic history would really make this DVD more worthwhile.  Too bad.

Yul Brynner plays Solomon and Gina Lollobrigida plays the Queen of Sheba, who's never directly given a name. She starts out trying to destroy Solomon, but ends up falling in love with him.

The sets are outlandish, the dialogue is too. The acting which is OK seems completely, and is, out of date. But for all of that it's still a watchable movie. The ending could have used a little work though, as could the action scenes, but still a watchable movie.",1232582400,,566,4.485436893203883
543368,2,6303050050,"Well, besides being a big ham, unless of course you are a big fan of the Bible and the Scriptures, this is a worthless effort in story telling.

Nowadays we have much more specific indications on who Solomon was and how the Queen of Sheba came into play. There are even sources that really and strongly doubt the two ever actually met.

So, premises apart, and taken into consideration that it is a Yul Brynner / Gina Lollobrigida vehicle, it is still watchable, especially for its ""saucy"" values of the time (1959).

A bit like ""The Prodigal"", this is by no means a serious attempt at translating the Bible into a historic document.

It is just Big Circus meets Big Actors. There is even poor George Sanders standing by, lending a hand at this.
Poor man, he must have been desperate in doing so.
Anyway, if the pay is right, why not...

It is barely good enough for Popcorn and Soda and for keeping your kids laughing for a couple of hours in front of your TV set.

Other than that, consider, it is cheap, so if you decide to buy it, it won't be a big dent in your purse, just do not expect something really intellectual out of this one.

And Yul in a wig is ridiculous at best.

Stick to ""The King and I"" or other better pictures, like ""The Magnificent Seven"" and even the Sci-Fi thriller ""Westworld"", if you really like to see Yul at his best.

From the few extracts that have emerged of Tyrone Power's footage this could have been a contender, but after his fatal heart attack filming the final swordfight with long-time co-star George Sanders, unpopular replacement Yul Brynner had the script rewritten to replace Power's doubting warrior king with a more confident and less interesting typical movie hero. There's a huge element of half-heartedness to much of the film that doesn't help matters, much of it no doubt due to reshooting so much of the film again, but it's doubtful this would ever have been more than big-budget hokum. The result is one of those films like Blood Alley (which saw Robert Mitchum controversially replaced by John Wayne days into filming), where the story of what happened behind the screen is much more interesting than the one on it.",1198886400,34,1204,4.96039603960396

It is amazing how good the film is, considering that it had to be almost completely reshot with Yul Brynner in the lead.  I do not care for George Sanders as Adonijah (he was clearly too old for the part), the film has some lengths, the battle scenes could be more exciting and the orgy scene needed better choreography, but the ensemble is still quite respectable.  The best thing in the film is clearly Gina Lollobrigida.  King Vidor considered Lollobrigida the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and his admiration for her is very tangible.  Freddie Young's cinematography always shows her through loving lenses.  Lollobrigida's acting and deportment were no doubt inspired in ancient high reliefs; they have an extraordinarily regal quality.  This film deserves a DVD with a critical commentary by a Vidor expert.

The film does a great job of describing life during the 10th century BC in Canaan with its constant warfare and its complex foreign policy, as well as the superstition, the fanaticism, and the fundamentalism that were so prevalent.

In addition, there is a very good portrayal of Solomon as a weak king, constantly undermined by his opponents.

Conflicts, disputes, feuds, and back stabbings are all about.

What I found especially interesting is how brutal and exclusive they were (something which for years has been purposely hidden).  So well done to this film for doing the obvious i.e. accurately presenting what one really encounters in the Old Testament for a change instead of all these inaccurate happy-happy films that we are so used to seeing e.g. the practice of stoning, the concept of the vengeful Yahweh etc

Yul Brynner, Gina Lollobrigida, Lawrence Naismith (who can also been seen in the 1962 masterpiece The 300 Spartans), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that can be watched over and over again!

The setting, the dialogues and the music are all wonderful!

543448,5,6303050050,"This is a fantastic and compelling 1950s biblical epic movie with first class acting, lavish and authentic costumes, exceptional battle sequences, breathtaking sets, and unforgettable spectacle. Yul Brynner plays Solomon, the King of Israel, a role he performs with exceptional skills. The Queen of Sheba is majestically played by the beautiful Gina Lollobrigida, whose captivating beauty easily tempted Solomon. In fact, this reminds me of one memorable scene when the Queen of Sheba performs a seduction dance during celebration in honour of he (pagan) God, Dagon. Solomon's scheming and jealous brother, Adonijah, is expertly played by George Sanders.

Adonijah, the warrior is passed over for succession after the death of King David. Solomon, who was renowned for his great wisdom, was chosen to be King of Israel. The result was permanent enmity between these two brothers.

The story of Solomon and Sheba is based on the Old Testament. However, in the scriptures, there is little mention of the Queen and the mysterious land of Sheba on which to base the plot. The story revolves around her state visit to Israel. Based on the little information available, the producers weaved out an interesting and complex plot where greed, power, passion and lust feature prominently in King Solomon's court.

The film shows that despite the renowned wisdom that Solomon possessed, he could not avoid being tempted by the Queen of Sheba, which almost resulted in the loss of his Kingdom. However, the Queen of Sheba ended up being deeply in love with Solomon.

This is a spectacular biblical epic movie that is action packed and will keep the audience glued to the screen.",1145923200,18,1666,5.136531365313653
543449,5,6303050050,"This was a movie I remembered seeing at a Saturday matinee when I was perhaps eleven years old. I never forgot it, and when I saw it available, I jumped at the chance. I have to say that it was certainly worth waiting for once again. The acting is all top notch (for this sort of thing) and the costumes, story line and ""spectacle"" are all better than I remembered them to be.

Granted Yul Brynner with hair is odd, but it does not distract from his impact as Solomon, or his appeal as a sexy leading man. He seems to have been born to play these regal parts. (Who can ever forget him as Rameses in the Ten Commandments?) George Saunders as his scheming brother Adonijah is simply delicious with his suave malevolence. But the real appeal here is Gina Lollobrigida as the tempting Queen of Sheba.

Her gowns are chiffon chic, her adornment is perfect and her beauty is quite simply riveting, even with a heavy coating of Eddie Leonard #55 greasepaint to ""darken"" her up. Although the dialogue could have easily degenerated into silliness, Lollobridgida manages to keep the lid on throughout. Her love scenes with Brynner are spot on for the era they represent. Of especial interest is her ""seduction dance"" performed in her encampment during the feast of the Sheban god Dagon. Gina gets down and mixes it up in the dancing girl department with the best of any of them!!

The story depicted in the film is not a fantasy. The events that transpired between the real Queen of Sheba and King Solomon, who reigned over perhaps the most sophisticated era of ancient Hebrew/Israelite dominion in the Levant, has been verified by archaeologists and is based upon what was recorded in the Old Testament about these two people. In fact, a recent touring museum exhibition showcased much of the material artifacts that verify the story of these ancient lovers and the worlds over which they each presided. As a historical footnote, it was their (illegitmate)son who was responsible for the ancient Judeo-Christian ethic that survives on the African continent in the land of Ethiopia even to this day, which some scholars believe was the heartland of Sheba in it's day.

The film is titillating without being ridiculous and has all the elements that make for a wonderfully ""big show"" such as well re-enacted battles and scenes of destruction that always add so much to ""epic"" productions. Although the final scene borders on the corny preachiness of DeMille, the movie as a whole is far above the caliber of these sorts of stories. If you have never seen this movie, and if you like ancient spectacle I highly recommend it. It IS one of the best of it's kind.",1126310400,8,2647,4.698275862068965
543450,4,6303050050,"I must say that this film was a very pleasant surprise. It was released in 1959 when biblical epics were at their zenith. Starring Yul Brynner, Gina Lollobrigida, George Sanders, and Marisa Pavan, this film is not lacking in star power. It is a lush, compelling story.
The film details the rivalry between Solomon (Yul Brynner) and his older brother, Adonijah (George Sands), the warrior. It was a rivalry that grew out of the fact that Adonijah was passed over for succession to their father David's throne upon his death. It was Solomon who was chosen to rule Israel. This was to cause a rift in their relationship that would be irreparable.
The film also details the love affair between the beautiful Queen of Sheba (Gina Lollobrigida) and Solomon, wise in all things except love. It shows how an affair that started out as a political maneuver on the part of the Queen of Sheba would turn into a selfless, passionate love of the heart. It was a love that would almost rend a nation asunder.
Yul Brenner, as the viewer has probably never seen him (with a head of hair), is excellent as the idealistic and tolerant ruler. Gina Lollobrigida turned out to be a much better actress than I had imagined. She is sensational as the beautiful, exotic, voluptuous Queen of Sheba. She also has a figure that must have been the envy of every woman at one time. It is a perfect hourglass figure that shows off her striking and seductive costumes to perfection.
George Sands is compelling as the envious Adonijah, who sought to take what was not his by any means, fair or foul. His desire for the throne would compromise the very existence of Israel and lead to a climactic finale. Moreover, his hatred for the Queen of Sheba was as great as that of his hatred for his brother. This wellspring of emotion was to have great repercussions for all.
Despite a pagan orgy scene that is so over the top as to be laughable, this is a spectacular biblical epic that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.",1018483200,62,1991,4.579831932773109

He pulls off the part quite nicely and the scene in which he judges which of two women is the true mother of a child is well done.  The rivalry makes sense, but the involvement of the Pharaoh of Egypt seems contrived and gimmicky.  There is suspense building up steadily and it is easy to like Solomon and to sympathize with his dilemma.  This Bible movie does not have as much scriptural content upon which to base a plot and therefore has more of a challenge in production than a story of King David or of Samson might have; nevertheless, a believable plot is offered and the work is admirable.
