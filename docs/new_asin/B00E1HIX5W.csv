Standard premise, misunderstood youth know better than parents. Yep and of course has to save sire from the evil bad guy that has gone amuck. Zack has Henry's (Michael Biehm) molecular watch and he wants it back. On the side father of Zack can be useful in completing project. So will Zack save his dad or will Francesca runoff to Tahiti with the bad guy?

One plus is the presents of French Stewart; I guess they needed one actor in the movie. And for distraction purposes Paula Garcs.",1500854400,,698,4.531746031746032

8600037,4,B00E1HIX5W,Clockstoppers originally had blown my socks off!  It sadly did not hold up to my expectations of what I remembered.  Jesse Bradford did a very good job as well as Paula Garces.  The let down is probably that there really isn't much of a story and the effects aren't as good as they could've  been.,1409184000,,297,4.345454545454546
8600038,4,B00E1HIX5W,The DVD arrived ahead of schedule. Thank you. This is a very good movie for the family. Jonathan Frakes (#1 from Star Trek TNG) directs this movie. Just a fun movie to watch.,1397088000,,174,4.303030303030303
