It is difficult to see what you have selected in the menu. As well it is difficult to know which icon is the documentary to select it to play.  Sticking the DVD in and pressing play or ""OK"" will play the default selection which is the slide show that others have mentioned. While the slide show is nice, to view the work, its boring.  When you find the film icon, however, you are treated to an excellent, though not perfect, documentary of Uelsmann and his work.

The film is a decent look at Uelsmann which uses a lot of inset clips of him talking about his work.  By inset I mean upper corner vignettes of him while the main image is going on.  Its not as bad as it sounds and works fairly well.  There is also interesting clips of him working in the darkroom in a sequence that is clearly purposefully difficult to follow (it gives the impression that its not as easy as Jerry would have you believe from his years of experience, rather its a complicated ordeal of skill).

There are three things that I dislike about the film: one is that Jerry's voice sounds canned (tin-like sound) and secondly the trippy music is overpowering too often and is much higher in volume than his voice.  The worst problem with the film fundamentally is that almost none of the photos shown are shown straight on; they zoom in, across, pan, spin, merge and every other effect but rarely just show a photo complete and still.  Its annoying, and I guess that is why the slide show appears on the disk; it shouldn't have been an afterthought though, it should have been done better in the film itself.  There is also several sequences which seem unnecessary but otherwise are tolerable (like a few minutes of photos of Jerry throughout his life).

All in all, its good, even great despite its flaws.",1335225600,,1914,4.484149855907781
8171647,1,B000MT00A4,"This is not a DVD, it is a slideshow of images set to horrible music.  The bio and links sections do not work, so you are not able to access any information about Jerry or hear his voice and opinions.  It is falsely represented as a DVD and a complete waste of money.  Buy one of his many books if you want to see his images - you will also have access to much more information!",1321142400,,378,3.9473684210526314
8171648,1,B000MT00A4,"I had not received this DVD for twenty minutes by the time I had completely regretted this purchase.
The beautiful photos are shown in a slideshow format with music in the background, but the pace is painfully slow.
The photographer's biography consists of a text page with music in the background!--no moving images or voiceover!!! Unbelievable.
I cannot believe that Jerry Uelsmann would authorize a video with such incredibly low production values.
I don't even want to resell this because I do not want anyone else to experience the utter dismay I have.
Trying to help others avoid buyer's regret for this video.",1319414400,,616,4.990291262135922
