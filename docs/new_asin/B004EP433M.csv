4337969,5,B004EP433M,"This series is an overlooked gem from the 1970s. It tries, and largely succeeds, to examine the personal side of one of history's most famous and, sadly, often stereotyped figures - Napoleon. The fine acting of Ian Holm and Philip Mackie's intelligent scripts give us a human Napoleon, full of faults and emotions just like anyone else. It makes for a remarkable and entertaining blend of drama and history.
Anyone looking for spectacle and a military and political history of the First Empire will be disappointed. This series concentrates solely on Napoleon and the women in his life. Battles and events may be mentioned in passing, names familiar to those with a knowledge of the period's history are constantly dropped, but this is a series about love and lust. As such, the focus is on character. Like many other British series of the time - I Claudius, Upstairs Downstairs, etc. - Napoleon And Love is studio based with sets ranging from fairly realistic to little more than theatrical backdrops. To compensate, the costumes are amazing and very accurate - the elaborate uniforms of the men almost as gorgeous as the Empire-style gowns of the women. So even though the production may seem dated by today's standards, it still looks pretty good.
By the way, the Amazon review by Ted Fry makes several references to this being a BBC production. It's not. Napoleon And Love was made by Thames Television.
The whole enterprise is helped immeasurably by a fantastic supporting cast, many of whom will be recognised by viewers of other British series. Some were just starting out like Tim Curry, looking very dashing in a hussar's uniform as Josephine's son. Most look remarkably like the historical character they are playing, none more so than Peter Bowles as the peacock Murat. But it is the women who make the best impression. Nicola Pagett is delightful as an actress while Catherine Schell is more subtle and graceful as Marie Walewska. Of course, the main woman in Napoleon's life was Josephine and Billie Whitelaw gives a tour de force performance in the role.
All in all, an excellent production and quite a sympathetic one considering it is a British production. More recent drama series have developed a kind of assembly-line feel about them. We can only hope that more and more treasures like Napoleon And Love will continue to be rescued from the archives.",1301184000,20,2369,4.910224438902743
4337970,5,B004EP433M,"A docu-drama, or dram-entory. It's half history and half romantic drama. Napoleon was as wild with his women as he was at making war. This series takes a look at some of the most significant women, lovers, of his life. An episode for each, and how one was played against another. It was all primarily for producing an heir, and satisfying Napoleon's desires.

This is not all about bedrooms, bed scenes, dances, and the social life. There are some political ties, and some military, but it is the telling of ""Napoleon & Love"" not his wars. If you want battle scenes, there is not much. If you want bedroom scenes, you get plenty. But all is done under cover and clothed, somewhat. Keeping in mind this is 1795 through 1815, you get a grand glimpse of lowcut French costumes both in court and in the bedroom.

The series was created years ago, but seems quite contemporary since it is a period piece, almost historical documentary, but it is drama, romantic drama, and the Brits do that well.

Stars: Napoleon (Ian Holm-'Ratatouille' 'Lord of the Rings'). He's young, passionate, self-indulgent, ambicious, & pompous.
 Josephine (Billie Whitlaw-'Quills'). Capt to Gen to Gov of Paris Murat (Peter Bowles-'Lytton's Diary' 'Rumpole of the Bailey' 'To the Manor Born' look those DVDs up). Berthier (Ronald Hines-'Middlemarch' 'We'll Meet Again' 'VanderValk' look those up).
Sorcha Cusack from ""Jane Eyre"" and one of my favorites John Welsh (""The Duchess of Duke Street"" a must own DVD).

From there he marries Josephine and she has a load of hook up. When he finds out he does likewise and plans to dismiss her. She cries so he takes her back.

Much kissing and cleavage though no one seems to be happy with the results. Engaging and at times heart-wrenching.",1502755200,,405,4.472972972972973

8427235,4,B004EP433M,"What is most astonishing is how Josephine (aka Rose) and most women were not physically attracted to the 5-foot-2-inch tall Napoleon (until he became well-known). When he proposed marriage, she emphatically turned him down. She told a friend that she had to overcome a feeling of repulsion to consummate their sexual relationship. She thought he was drab and boring, serious with no sense of humor. The actress portrayed this when Napoleon was explaining how he and his battalion drove out a fleet of British ships from Toulon, a southern seaport city in France, and her eyelids became heavy. She could not appreciate his brilliant analytical mind and military genius (he was a little over her head), but she greatly admired his reputation for bravery. Over time she grew to deeply love him. When she realized that her affair with Captain Charles was making Napoleon maddeningly jealous and he demanded a divorce, she pleaded for forgiveness and promised never to cheat again. And she kept that promise; although, Napoleon had affairs as he pleased. When Josephine expressed disapproval, Napoleon didn't understand why it should bother her. He told her they were merely for physical gratification; there was no emotional attachment. She had to accept his double standard. Of all his sexual encounters, he never loved anyone as he did Josephine. After he became Emperor, they did divorce out of a necessity to conceive an heir (for the throne) with a younger woman, they both anguished over it. In selecting a mate, Napoleon was choosing between two sisters of the Russian Czar Alexander: Catherine, age 20; Anna age 14. He first chose Catherine (aka Katarina), but Catherine's mother considered Napoleon ""a plebeian upstart Corsican monster"" not deserving of her daughter. The Czar later announced the engagement of his sister, Catherine, to the Duke of Oldenburg. This infuriated Napoleon, because he wanted Russia as an ally not an enemy. Napoleon then requested Anna, but the Czar's mother refused, saying Anna was too young. Napoleon had acquired a son with Poland's Marie Walewska. She loved Napoleon dearly and was devoted and loyal to him to the end when everyone else abandoned him. He told her he couldn't accept for marriage anyone other than an Emperor's daughter. So on April 2, 1810, he married Maria Louise, the 19-year-old daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria and great niece of Marie Antoinette. Marie Louise gave birth to a son, Napoleon-Francois-Joseph-Charles, on March 20, 1811. Napoleon and Josephine remained close throughout their lives, and he gave her the Malmaison estate and 3 million francs a year to live on.",1470268800,4,2641,5.1157407407407405

8427237,4,B004EP433M,"If you can get past the fact that this mini-series is dated (released on DVD in 2011 but made by BBC in the mid 1970s) in its pace and staging -- AND you have a keen interest in the personal side of Napoleon Bonaparte -- you won't want to miss this one.

9 parts, 7+ hours, wonderful costumes, strong cast led by British actors Ian Holm (Napoleon) and the late Billie Whitelaw (Josephine). You'll also spot early appearances in the careers of Diana Quick (Brideshead Revisited), Nicola Pagett (Anna Karenina), and Catherine Schell (Tale of Beatrix Potter), and Tim Curry (Adams Family Reunion).

It's a pretty full story of all the women Napoleon was involved with, dominated by his long, loving and tempestuous relationship with Josephine. You get to witness his rise to power in the background, but the focus is on his love life and the quest for an heir.  I thought there were moments when Holm overacted a bit -- it felt more like he was a stage actor -- exaggerating every emotion rather than expressing them more subtly to the camera. But mostly he did a believable job as the ambitious general-turned-emperor. And it's fascinating to watch his ego grow and grow.",1459641600,2,1169,4.692682926829268
