The writing and direction are skillful enough to make it work better than most no budget horror flicks.  The plot is very stock and straight forward- kids isolated from help getting picked off one-by-one by a mysterious monster.  But, the short length of the film (just over 1 hour) and the semi-fast pace keep it from becoming a complete drag.

One star for not trying to pretend it's a great horror film plus  one star for being short plus two stars for having cute young women hop around the beach in bikinis minus one star for the fake blood being too red = 3 stars.",1424044800,2,704,4.33587786259542
