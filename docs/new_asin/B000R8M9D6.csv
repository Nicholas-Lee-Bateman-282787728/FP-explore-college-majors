8199427,3,B000R8M9D6,"Feeders/Among Us 2-movie DVD review:

Feeders is typical Polonia Bros vanity project (John even co-stars) no budget junk, but with nifty alien puppet monsters.

Among Us is actually entertaining-- it's a horror movie and a Mockumentary and a comedy and a romance, and if it had had a more polished script, tighter editing, and slightly more professional (or better directed) actors, it would actually be a pretty neat little picture. But it's still a Polonia Bros movie. Watching it, you'll roll through two or three scenes going ""you know, this isn't bad"" and then BAM something will happen to remind you you're still stuck in Poloniaville.

Which is not to knock the brothers-- their movies, whatever they lack, roll along and deliver at least the basic requirements of the kind of movies that they are. The main cast is certainly game (John Polonia's in it but has very few lines) and there are lots of great in-joke references to comics and movies too.  Just kinda frustrating to see Among Us and think... If only they'd spent a little more time and effort...",1491782400,,1063,4.824175824175824

But I love it.  Feeders seems accidentally good.  It's got a weird vibe going for it.  Among Us is very tongue-in-check.  Low-budget horror movie makers making fun of the low budget genre.  I get the in-joke and I like it.

That said, if you like Shatter Dead, Meat Market, Splatter Farm, or any of the classic SOV Films, you should check this out if the price is right.  If you have no idea what I'm talking about, AVOID.",1470268800,,610,4.31858407079646
8199429,1,B000R8M9D6,"Feeders is made by the Polonia brothers, Pennsylvania's answer to Ed Wood. The produce, write, direct and star in their own productions known for their sci-fi nature and bad props. In this feature, ET looking aliens come to Pennsylvania and start feeding on the local population similar to vampires. The aliens are fragile and easily killed.

The film has the jerky movement of a handheld camera. It is not that this is ""found footage"" film, but rather because tripods cost money. The acting and sound track is on par with what one would expect from a mid level corporation to produce.

F-bomb, no sex or nudity.

This feature is a mocumentary of fictional Bigfoot movies. It is a clever idea that didn't live up to expectations.
