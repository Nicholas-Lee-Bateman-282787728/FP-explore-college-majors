8311558,2,B001IYURIW,"Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo(2007) is a remake of Carlos Enrique Taboada's 1968 Gothic horror classic. This remake has good camera work, decent acting, decent music, and good production values. It's updated with drug use, curse words, nudity, and bloodshed. It also tries to emulate Asian horror films. I have to be honest. This remake is nowhere as good as the 1968 classic. Carlos Enrique Taboada's original Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo was driven by a ""less is more"" technique. This remake has overt, sexual tension between women and excess! The original film took place in a school. This remake takes place at an asylum for drug addicts. Norma Lazareno played Kitty in the original film. Kitty's name has been changed to ""Jessica"" in this remake. In both films, a ghost called Andrea haunts a bunch of girls. The girls are also bullied by the principal, Miss Bernarda. Josefina was a minor character in the original film and she was played by Elizabeth Dupeyron. In the remake, she's one of the main characters. Alicia Bonet played Claudia in the 1968 version. In the remake, she makes a cameo as Claudia's mother. This remake of Hasta El Viento Tiene Miedo is a pale imitation of the original.",1338940800,4,1196,4.810679611650485
