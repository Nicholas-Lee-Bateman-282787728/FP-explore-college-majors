2772167,4,B000NKDLEE,"I think that given the various genres on the show that I expected the DVD to have all types of artists.  I actually have the whole series.  The performances are complete.  If you like the infomercial then you'd like the DVDs.  Each DVD ranges from 70-95 minutes.  I found the sound & picture quality to be good.  The standup comedy acts are short and are under 'bonus features' so the running time of the DVD is all music.  It is great to see some of these artists from the 70s (many of whom are no longer with us) and I've enjoyed watching every performace thus far simply because they take me back in time-even the songs I hated.  Janis Ian, Heart, Fleetwood Mac's Rhiannon really stand out to me as awesome performances but there are more and I would think everybody would fine their favorites.  Two Marvin Gaye performances in the series (not this DVD) are great to see even though he was 'under the weather'.  There are a tiny handful of performances that are not live and the artists lip sync but it's only a couple and still fun to see--like Soul Train!  The ONLY reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that I found the series to be a bit pricey... I thought they could have done better since I ordered the whole series at once.. but after seeing the product I'd do it again if I had to.

2772168,2,B000NKDLEE,"Yes, I knew what I was buying when I placed my order.  Still after watching the dvd, I was extremely disappointed and will not be ordering any more.  There is no theme to these dvds.  Just a hodgepodge of selections from various episodes.  A better concept would have been to have released complete episodes from the year in question or release collections devoted to style of music (soul, disco, pop, hard rock, etc)",1222128000,7,417,4.671232876712328
2772169,3,B000NKDLEE,"I grew up watching the midnight special when i was young in the 70's and 80's and seeing it today there are a few choice moments on these videos to cherish such as elton johns your song, heart's magic man, eric carmen's all by myself and fleetwood mac's over my head..however there is also alot of junk they could have eliminated such as england dan, tom jones and hot chocalate. the problem i find with midnight special is what kind of audience they were aiming at? I think that kershners rock concert was a far better show. at least i did not have to watch helen reddy and olivia newton john sing .",1185753600,5,600,4.31858407079646
2772170,5,B000NKDLEE,"There are performances on here you can find nowhere else.

2772174,5,B000NKDLEE,I was a little girl when this show was on and I remember my parents watching it. I have always been a fan of 70s music. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves this genre of music. You won't be disappointed!,1369958400,,211,4.0476190476190474
2772175,5,B000NKDLEE,love particularly the performances by Hot Chocolate - Heart ... too bad the full sets are so pricey.  what else can one say.,1366156800,,124,4.391304347826087

8179063,1,B000NKDLEE,If you like the musical performances of these bands then this is fine although if you have internet in your home you can watch all these exact musical performances on every Midnight Special DVD on the internet. Which pretty much makes these DVDs useless. Don't waste your money. I watched The Midnight Special when I was young. And I want to see the exact TV show from start to finish with the host of the show and all the extras that went along with it. It gets one star for the musical performances.,1487635200,,501,4.397849462365591
