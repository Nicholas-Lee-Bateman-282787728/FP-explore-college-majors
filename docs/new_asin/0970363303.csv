173550,4,0970363303,Good video; makes following the lymph system easy. Gives good massage technique. Would help a new masseuse understand this technique.,1388275200,,133,5.7
173551,3,0970363303,Not a bad DVD. I ordered it after I did a course for MLD and needed to refresh my memory. It did help but I didn't like the changing from prone to supine several times. It is very disruptive as patient is very relaxed. Still very good tuition and I am happy with it.,1386288000,,266,3.9444444444444446

173554,5,0970363303,"Perhaps the best present I've gotten for myself. And useful for helping grandma relieve those swollen cankles.

I learned a lot about the lymph system, it's function, and what lymphatic massage ISN'T. So, now I won't make those common mistakes that beginner massage therapists do.

The self-massage techniques were easy to follow: and some can be done at the desk, on break, during commercial breaks at home, and for relaxing down-time before bed.

The first couple minutes of home-made low-pro audio music made me skeptical, but the video production values got better within the first two minutes.",1359504000,11,598,5.144329896907217

173556,4,0970363303,The music is going to put you to sleep- for sure. It's so bad !! It's not relaxing just very hypnagogic. Don't watch it if you have to drive or be conscious. However tutorial itself is very good. You will not find a better one.,1358553600,2,227,4.066666666666666
173557,4,0970363303,I really like Sean Riehl and found the DVD interesting and easy to follow. I have been a nationally certified massage therapist for nearly 20 years and just needed to brush up on lymphatic massage.  It was a good purchase.,1348617600,2,222,4.55

173559,3,0970363303,This is a good beginning lymph drainage DVD.  It tends to get a little slow and repetitive if you have any training in lymph at all.  My employees use it as an introduction for very basic technique.  I personally was looking for something a little more in-depth and technical.,1338249600,7,276,4.591836734693878
173560,5,0970363303,THIS IS A VERY GOOD VIDEO ABOUT LYMPHATIC MASSAGE SHOWING HOW TO DO A LYMPHATIC MASSAGE ON FACE AND BODY.  THE PRESENTATION WAS ALSO EDUCATIONAL EXPLAINING ALL. ABOUT THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM IN AN INTERESTING WAY.,1313712000,,210,5.0

173564,3,0970363303,"This one is hard to review, but I will try.

I am a Physical Therapist, and I also have lymphatic issues. I bought this book to get a better idea of technique for MLD (as this is a specialty course over and above my education).

I was surprised at how much education was provided on anatomy and function of the lymphatic system. It was very well done in a manor that all can understand.

However, I was a bit disappointed with the guidance on technique. He does an excellent job at providing instruction on MLD of the face. But not for the hands, feet or back. He touches on the basic areas of the body, but that is about it. His technique is right and his guidance is good. It is just a very basic video, and I was hoping for more.

In summary, it is good and is worth getting and is great for beginers. If you are looking for something thorough that covers the entire body and ALL of the lymphatic flow directions, than this will not help much. I am still glad I got it. It was a good review and helped a little.",1232668800,41,1014,4.131979695431472
173565,5,0970363303,"This video dy-mysitfies Lympahtic Drainage therapy- and makes it easy to understand. Like all the Real Bodywork videos, it is filmed very well, with great computer graphics. If you want to help clients with edema, this is the video to get. I did the techniques on a client with swelling in her wrist, and it went down after only one session! Thank you Real Bodywork for the great tool.",1113091200,54,385,4.594202898550725
173566,5,0970363303,"This video is very well presented- it covers the lymphatic system in detail, and shows the techniques clearly. I think this is very valuable information for any massage therapist or anyone who wants to work on a family member. This video is especially made as training for a massage therpist, but I think that anyone could learn from it because the presentation is so clear!",1036886400,15,374,4.769230769230769

173569,4,0970363303,"In one sense, this video is excellent in terms of the extensive content and detailed illustration and demonstration of the massage techniques.  However, the video quality is very poor and makes it hard to understand and frustrating to watch.  I haven't been able to find this very useful information in any other format.  So, I recommend it with strong caution about the video quality.  I tried it on two different VCR machines with no success.  Maybe you will have better luck.",999820800,14,478,4.851851851851852
