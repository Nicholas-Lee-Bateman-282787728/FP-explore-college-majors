4296871,4,B004A8ZWW4,"...in good ways and a few bad. First of all let me say, and my rating should suggest, that I recommend this film. I enjoyed it as a fun popcorn movie. Will I buy it? Probably not; but I would watch it again for sure. This film is pure escapsim but in a much more endearing way than most cgi robot films. This is Rocky meets Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, an odd combination but one that works overall.

Hugh Jackman and Evangeline Lilly really make this story work on a much higher level than it should. There is some unrealistic and forced dialogue that is delivered well enough and sincerely enough to keep it from being distracting. The child actor does a decent job and though he isn't always quite natural I can't fault him and he has the personality needed for the role (perhaps his look just reminds me too much of the awful kid who played Anakin Skywalker in Phantom Menace, but this child is far more spirited and likable). The rest of the casting is fun, if not a little stiff, but the film moves along at a pace where you just enjoy the ride and characters serve their purpose.

The real stars of the film are Hugh, Evangeline and the young kid (Dakota Goyo) and they keep you involved. Then there is the Real selling point who might also be considered a star, the robot, Atom. He is well designed and even a likable character despite not having a single line of dialogue. I kept expecting them to go in the direction of the robot having an artificial intelligence but thankfully things are left more light and ambiguous.

Other positives, the CG is great overall, the cinematograhpy is well done and doesn't make you sick or lose track of the fights. The fight arenas are each different and each of the fights, which can feel repititive in a film like this, feels fresh and distinct in enough ways to stand as unique.

The story has some points that don't play as naturally as they could, expository lines and forced scenes, but ultimately all is forgiven in the final showdown when the final blows are thrown as they are (both literally and metaphorically). If the climax of the film doesn't make you cheer it at least makes you feel good and returns you for a brief moment to a level of nostalgic childhood excitement.

We all know where the film is going, but it is fun getting there. And we've never seen it done with robots before, so why not? Go out see this film and have some fun, its a good film for the preteen/young adolescent crowd or for families (despite some colorful dialogue from both father and son). This films ending really, ahem, packs a punch...",1317945600,2,2574,4.444915254237288
4296872,5,B004A8ZWW4,"No? Me neither.

I ask the question, because more often than not, blockbusters, or cheesy b movie or fun concepts seem to be falling under that trap nowadays that I assume was set by the otherwise stellar film Inception, where they tried to be too deep and took themselves seriously.

Alright, I'll admit, I'm somewhat lying by answering ""no"" to the question. We did have the 90s, where film's weren't overly pretentious, where they knew what they weren't anything deep, and just went with it and was fun as a result. The Mummy was one I can name. And now, the first movie in a while to just focus kn being entertaining has come out: Real Steel. I was lucky to catch the film at an advance screening tonight, and even despite being a free screening, I felt like I put my money to good use.

The film takes place in 2027 and centers around Charlie Kenton, a burnt out boxer who owes over thousands of dollars in unpaid lost robot fights- robot fights having replaced human boxing. After a fiasco that is the result of losing A match against a bull, he discovers an ex girlfriend who had his son has died, and his rather bratty son is being taken not custody by adoptive parents. The parents are given $100 ,000 for custody and Charlie looks after his bratty son, Max, while the adoptive parents are in Italy.

After he loses yet ANOTHER fight, which is surprising considering this robot, Noisyboy, is a world renowned robot, he and Max take to the wrecked robot yard to find pieces to create a new robot, when a fall down a cliff results in finding Atom, a G20 sparring bot. They take the bot home and, despite being a sparring bot, Max believes Atom has true potential. After winning a match at a zoo, they realize Atom's true potential, and climb their way up the ladder, in a series of fights leading to the ultimate fight- a fight against a champion robot named Zeus.

Real Steel is pure, unadulterated fun. Not once did I feel bored, or beaten over the head with pretentious ""symbolism"". I went in with no expectations but just a fun rock em sock em robot movie, and came out feeling good about myself and impressed.

The reason I enjoyed this so much is for the fact that It knew it wasn't anything deep. I mean, when you have a movie about fighting robots, you want just that, and it gives you that. This wasn't like Transformers 2 or 3 (though 3 was enjoyable) where they took themselves too seriously, and focused more on humans running around trying to figure out supposed conspiracies than the robot fighting. Sure this has some family drama, which is essential to the plot, so no worries there... But even there, the film doesn't take itself too seriously.

The film is a tad predictable, which does kind of detract (but only slightly), as you know how the fights are going to end. That said, the predictability does not prevent the fights from being fun and suspenseful. On the topic of the fights themselves, they are ridiculously well done and shot. Apparently they were done with real boxers wearing motion capture suits, and it shows, the fighting is realistic, fluid and human like. The Twin City fight was probably my favourite in the movie! And the final fight is intense, sure to have many on the edge oft heir seats.

In short, Real Steel is proof that movies are able to be enjoyable despite being not overly deep, and furthermore are more enjoyable for not trying to be too deep. It's fun, it's funny, it's heartfelt, and is sure to be a real hit this year, as well as I can see a well deserved cult following in this film's future! Don't miss out on it.

OVERALL: 9/10

PROS: Real Steel is safe, clean fun with lots of exciting robot action, laughs, thrills and heart and doesn't take itself too seriously or try to be too deep. Oh, and you will wish robot boxing existed, so you can buy tickets every weekend!

CONS: Predictability, you can tell how it will end from pretty early on.",1317772800,2,3908,4.490140845070423
4296873,4,B004A8ZWW4,"On Monday September 28, 2011, I and my son were invited to an advance screening of the new DreamWorks Pictures' movie Real Steel that was shown at the Uptown Palladium in Birmingham. MI. It turned to be one exciting film that we both enjoyed from beginning to end.

Real Steel takes place in the year 2020 where boxing is now done  by robots that fight to the death.  Hugh Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, a washed up former fighter turned robot boxing promoter that has been down on his luck for a good while.  Charlie has been trying to hit it big in robot boxing, but ends up owing large sums of money to some very dangerous people.

One day he finds out that his former girlfriend has died, leaving him as the official guardian to his 11 year old son Max (played by Dakoto Goyo), who Charlie has not seen since since Max was a baby.  Max's aunt (played by Hope Davis) wants Charlie to give up custody of Max to her and her very rich husband.  And Charlie sees this situation as a way to get quick cash to buy another fighting robot so that he can get out of debt.

But what Charlie does not count on is the fact that his son Max is one tough kid that shows him how to have the heart to try to win again against the odds.  And Max teaches Charlie that when you do what you love, the money will come.

Real Steel is an exciting and endearing film.  Even though we all knew how the story would end, we could not help cheering for Charlie as he discovers how to finally be a dad and how to finally be a winner. And Dakoto Goyo who played Max is one awesome kid actor who made everyone in the audience fall in love with him.  My son likes his movies exciting and the fight scenes in Real Steel are in your face loud and graphic.  It was like watching a giant robot boxing video game on the movie screen.

The most exciting part of the movie for me were the scenes that were filmed right here in Detroit.  Yep, this movie contains footage and aerial shots of downtown Detroit, including Cobo Hall and the GM Renaissance Center.  I was bursting with Detroit pride when I saw my city on the big screen.

Just a warning to parents that this film is rated PG-13 because of the graphic boxing violence and because it contains quite a bit of adult language.

If you like a real good underdog story that is funny, captivating and heartfelt, Real Steel delivers on all counts and will open in theaters nationwide of Friday, October 7th, 2011.",1317168000,16,2429,4.254901960784314
4296874,5,B004A8ZWW4,"***There may be some minor spoilers***

If you follow this link you will see some very detailed reviews, however, I'll try to keep this one short.  And this is a review of the movie, not the later DVD product; I've only seen the two hour movie.  ""Real Steel"" is the second reworking of the Richard Matheson (author of movies and novels like ""Duel"", ""The Night Stalker"", ""I Am Legend"") short story 'Steel'.  The first was on Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"" and starred the great Lee Marvin.  Richard Matheson's fiction and films influenced everybody from Stephen King to Stephen Spielberg.  His story 'Little Girl Lost' also became a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, and later became Spielberg's ""Poltergeist"" movie.  His very first published short story is an acknowledged classic.

Here we see a complete re-working of the story, and the broken down manager of a broken down robot becomes a broken down ex-boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) who is an incompetent, gambleholic owner of a series of robots who keeps blowing every chance he's given.  Suddenly, while on the run from creditors, he's told that he's a father, his estranged wife has died, and he's suddenly up for custody of his boy (Max).

Needing money, he offers to sell his custody to his sister-in-law and her husband, but since they are going to Italy, he has to take care of Max for a couple of months first.

Their relationship is rocky, although Max takes to the owner of a gym (Evangeline Lilly as Bailey) that the two are staying at.  Gradually father and son become closer through the re-building of a found sparring robot (Atom).  At first Charlie doesn't want anything to do with the robot, but Max is stubborn, and Charlie enters Atom in an underground fight.

Atom wins, and the fighting escalates and the fights become harder.  But, Max and Charlie keep winning, and they start to gather the attention of the fight world, until they are talked into a fight in the ""A"" leagues.  Although they are threatened, and offered large sums of money to sell Atom, it all comes to naught as Charlie and Max publically challenge Zeus, the reigning fighting champ.  Zeus is a robot whose AI can adapt and absorb the fighting styles of all comers. And we are still only little more than half-way through the movie.

This is an age-old Hollywood and pulp formula.  Usually the parent/guardian is at odds with the child until they find a common ground, and that common ground is usually an animal.  Here it is a robot, and an interest in fighting.  Charlie is a loser, who through his son learns to fight, instead of either whining about, or running away from, adversity.  By fighting for the respect of his son, he learns to respect himself again, and to try to live up to what a good father should be.  He doesn't have to be perfect, but Max just wants him to TRY.  Max himself goes from somebody with an attitude, to somebody with a goal, to win, and get his father's love and respect.

It really IS all by the numbers.  The good guys are flawed, but with inner hearts of gold, the good guy's friends are all loyal, the bad guys are all arrogant and hissable.  Atom is a beat-up has-been robot, and Zeus just an all shiny, big, unstoppable toy.  But Atom has an experienced fighter, with a life-time of experience as his master, while Zeus is all about flash, without any real experience, or knowledge of fighting behind his masters.

The cast all do their jobs.  Hugh Jackman as Charlie, is miles away from Wolverine, he's an unlikable loser, screw-up, fool, and bad-boy, who despite his boxing background gets his clock cleaned at least once.  Dakota Goyo (Thor) is cute, and still learning his craft, his character carries a chip, but he isn't unlikable while carrying it.

Evangeline Lilly (""Lost"") as Bailey Tallet is the much put upon ex-girlfriend who doesn't have much to do except be the pretty, tomboyish mechanic and cheerleader.  Which she does very well.

Kevin Durand as Ricky, Charlie's personal nemesis (who has worked with both Jackman (in ""Wolverine"") and Lilly (in ""Lost"") before, is just perfect as the bully, loudmouth, and blowhard who we all want to see get his just deserts.  Hope Davis (""Mildred Pierce"") and James Rebhorn (""Law & Order"") are good as Max's guardians, while Olga Fonda as the Russian ice queen, and owner of Zeus, and Karl Yune as the arrogant developer of Zeus, are dime on perfect in their roles.  Let's hope this movie kick-starts their careers.

Look hard and you'll see Richard Goteri, the artistic director of the famed Second City, and voice-over master Phil LaMarr (""Futurama"", ""King Of The Hill"", ""Family Guy"") in rare in-front-of-the-camera appearances.  The robots are all great looking and NONE of them look like the other; they all have an individualistic look, a plus in a movie like this.

Yeah this movie steals from dang-near everybody, from a scene in ""Terminator 2"" to ""The Transformers"" to ""Black Beauty"", but so what?  I didn't go to this movie to learn brain surgery, or to see the seamy underbelly of society exposed.  I got a free ticket, and took my seventy plus mother to see it, and there were two generations that enjoyed this old-fashioned, family entertainment.  To say that this is a robot ""Rocky"" is to underestimate it, and to be a lazy reviewer.  Take the family and cheer for the good guys.",1316736000,10,5327,4.725893824485373
4296875,5,B004A8ZWW4,"Nothing makes cinema more compelling than giant fighting robots; combine that with characters confronting adversity because of their involvement with giant fighting robots, friendships that develop because of the giant fighting robots, and moments of genuine peril BECAUSE of the giant fighting robots... well this is great cinema, no?

Transformers didn't have the budget to show the real wonder and majesty of giant fighting robots, but Real Steel pulls no punches in this department; the trailer alone must have cost $100,000,000 and half the scenes aren't even in the movie.

The simple fact of film (and life) is this; if it looks awesome whilst Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" plays in the background, and has giant fighting robots, then it's an awesome movie.  If it pulls this off for 90 minutes, then it's above awesome - it's Real Steel.

I haven't actually seen this movie yet, but I can tell it will be the greatest movie of the year, possibly even the decade. I sometimes cry during Karate Kid (not the new one)",1315353600,5,1019,4.872832369942197

4300563,3,B004A8ZWW4,"My son was so excited to see this movie with me (hopefully he sees this review many years down the road).

I found Real Steel ""watchable,"" at best.  I'm a Hugh-ge Jackman fan, so I was more than mildly disappointed to see awkward acting when it came to several scenes between him and young Anakin Skywalker.  However, Jackman's acting prowess was definitely a saving grace for the rest of the movie, and the premise, albeit laughable, was still nonetheless enjoyable in watching mechanized men duke it out instead of ""real people.""

My only real qualm with the movie was the end - what happened between Jackman's character and Skywalker's?  Jackman goes back to get the kid for one last fight...was that it? He gets the kid for that final fight and then takes him back to his custodian, never to have any contact with him again?  Huge, HUGE plot gap that I wish they would have filled with at least an answer, if not a nice tear-jerker ending where ""Dad"" stayed in the picture.",1459209600,,977,4.586206896551724

4301319,5,B004A8ZWW4,"it was for my grandson, he had seen the movie before, but enjoyed watching it again",1445817600,,83,4.25
4301320,5,B004A8ZWW4,"This one of our family favorites.  Jackman is great as Charlie, an ex-pugilist and hapless opportunist (with a good heart buried in there somewhere), turned owner-operator of a robot boxer.  The robot boxers are huge finely-tuned remote-controlled robots that now dominate the boxing ring, and the movie makes them appear very real.  Evangeline Lilly is beautiful and convincing as Bailey who still believes in Charlie, but is becoming fed-up with his get-rich-quick schemes.  Kevin Durand steals the scenes he has as Charlie's rival/nemesis, and Anthony Mackie does a great job as the streetwise fight promoter.  I let my 8 and 11 y.o. sons watch this movie and they love it.  There is a tiny bit of rough language, and only a brief and subtle sexual inuendo between Charlie and Bailey, when just back in from the road Charlie jokingly says to her, ""I need a shower. Bailey, you want to take a shower?"" She laughingly rebuffs him of course, and there is no physical intimacy displayed between the two of them.  At one point after giving up custody of his son because he realizes he has endangered him, an emotionally and physically drained Charlie returns to Bailey and lays next to her and sleeps in a very caring and respectful way.  The next morning they share a single kiss and as Charlie prepares to leave again to go to his son, Bailey remarks, ""You came a long way for just one kiss"", indicating that that's all that happened.  Also, there is a fist-fight scene when people come to collect a debt from Charlie that may be scary for younger kids 8 and under.  IMHO, compared to the risque' and deviant themes some movies foist upoin our kids these days, Real Steal is very tolerable in that regard and delivers a fast-paced story with heart and good special effects, and we meet a variety of characters along the way.  In the end we see the fruits of the efforts of a father and son who find each other and a place in the world together. At the heart of this story are themes of the value of loyalty, family, contrition, courage, accepting responsibility and taking initiative on your beliefs and dreams. In the end and even with all his faults, Charlie, who is never really portrayed as a hero, learns to be a better man and father.  And it's all done against the back-drop of giant brawling robots!!!  My kids keep asking when the sequel is coming....",1445817600,,2360,4.644230769230769

4301322,4,B004A8ZWW4,I hadn't read much about this movie nor had I heard much about it. I do love Hugh Jackman in his other movies so I decided to give it a try. This move was fairly good. It had a decent plot line. I was able to tell from about 30 minutes into it how it was going to end though. Other than that it didn't lull too much during the movie. The plot kept moving along and there were no dull moments where you get bored. Over all I would say good movie with good plot.,1445558400,3,460,3.8020833333333335

4301368,3,B004A8ZWW4,"Wanted to love this so much. It wasn't a bad film per se. Jackman was jackman. Never the strongest actor in my opinion. The kid was good, even if a little unbelievable.

But there was just so much that went unexplained. I kept waiting for the kid to really find out if the robot was self aware or not. Hints are dropped, but it's never revealed. We do know that the robot is dumped and almost lost forever under a mountain of trash, only to ""save"" the life of the kid who almost dies down there.

We also know he was a sparring robot, but was not built to fight. Which meant he could take a pummeling and still get up.

We see the creators or ""Zeus"", are worried right from the beginning about this newcomer. Why? If he's just a piece of junk against the undefeated Zeus why are they worrying? We see the creator of Zeus talk in the background, but many times are not let in on what he is saying. Was this robot a sparring partner to Zeus? Was it thrown in the dump because it actually had the capability of beating Zeus?

This was how I thought it would pan out, but we are left with no explanation.

Overall, apart from these personal questions, this movie wasn't so bad. Worth a watch on a quiet night in when the kids are in bed...",1445126400,,1235,4.1722689075630255

A bit slow at the beginning as things wind up, but once the kid finds the robot, the film settles into a good pace and turns a robot 'Rocky' story.

It is inspiring, it's something you'll definitely want to cheer for, your kids will love it. I love it, and I am supposedly a grownup. The kid is not in any way overshadowed by Jackman, and I love his gutsy performance. The backstory is moving and realistic. This has heart in a very Rocky sort of way, along with super impressive, very believable, massive fighting robots. What's not to like? It's an underdog classic! I really wish there were events like this, because I would be a rabid fan, screaming my lungs out! And folks, I'm a Mom who could honestly care less about sports, so that's really saying something. You need to own it.",1437177600,,746,4.492647058823529

I was loving every minute & way into it up until the part where the kid started dancing with the robot on his way to the ring. In my opinion, It was just way too corny & overdone. If they could've left it out then the movie would've been perfect. It just spoiled it for me & If you can get past it like I couldn't then I think you'll really enjoy Real Steel.

4302344,5,B004A8ZWW4,"There aren't much new here in Real Steel but in the end, it's enjoyable and has plenty of heart. The climax isn't so much overwhelming but it intends to be more heartfelt. Again, it's like Over The Top which the father is trying to make his son proud and Rocky because it's boxing and add some robots in it. Even without thinking much about the robots, there is always human heart in this film. Hugh Jackman does it again. The underdog fighting movie genre does it again. It's really a fun film for the whole family.",1426204800,,516,4.385416666666667

Parents beware, there are a few expletives used in this movie, including the s-word and a-word...and they are said throughout the movie by Hugh Jackman's character. Felt it was a bit unnecessary, but it is what it is. If you have boys that are into competition, robots and action, the will love this movie.",1416355200,,422,4.565789473684211

We are Sci Fi nuts and this was fun on a family level as well. Just to preface this review a bit. This is the only ""fighting"" game my son is allowed to play and the only reason I let him is it is robots not breathing beings.
***Spoiler Alert** there is a human fight scene that bothered him because there was a child involved but not really harmed.",1415059200,,506,4.01980198019802

4302939,3,B004A8ZWW4,"My brother told me I had to rent this movie because he thought it was outstanding. My reaction was different. Just OK for me. I thought it was derivative and fell short of what I wanted it to be. Mostly, I'm more into sentient robot stories that examine issues of personal freedom and individual rights, or work as an allegory for something meaningful. Real Steel is essentially a story about a washout fighter on a comeback. The robots are just props. They could have been planes, boats, computers, anything, because this movie is primarily about a self-centered father reconnecting with his kid, a kid who, for this viewer, can be a bit cocky and obnoxious. The writer and director take us on a journey of relationship rediscovery, and this leads us predictably to an emotional payoff, but the payoff pales in comparison to what you have in movies like The Champ, either the original or the remake with Jon Voight and Ricky Schroder. If you want a guaranteed cry at the end of a boxing movie, and you don't care about robots, rent The Champ.",1414800000,,1043,4.643243243243243

On top of that, the primary actors are great (although the kid's acting is okay, he over-acts but, hey, he did well).

If you love boxing and robots, in a ROCKY-like underdog storyline, you'll love this no matter how old or young you are.

Both those things make it a family movie, since it is kind of family sentimental,
and since there is no real violence other than steel clashing, sparks flying,
and oil spilling.
It is also kind of a sci fi movie, since there are robots in there, not very bright
ones, cool cell phones, and great screens of various kinds

Rocky Balboa would have been proud of the little robot hero in the movie. It can take almost as many punches as he did from Drago

4303785,4,B004A8ZWW4,"Not too big of a fan of Hugh Jackman. He tries really hard to not let his Australian accent come through but I thought this was a good combo of ""Robot Jox"" and ""Over the Top"". Enjoyable....my kids loved it.",1400803200,,206,4.175

4303831,4,B004A8ZWW4,I saw the previews of this movie at a theatre and thought I might like it.  The story is farfetched since it is Rocky with robots but the robot was really likable unlike the ones in Transformers and Dakota played his part as sensitive but tough kid who just wanted to be with his father and would do anything to do it well.  Hugh Jackson will always be the tough guy who finds he has a tender-side and I suppose that's the way they caste him.  The dance Dakota and the robot do at one point is unexpected and just a great scene and in the end you want them to beat the arrogant characters and somehow find a way to stay together.,1399680000,,629,4.097560975609756

4303836,2,B004A8ZWW4,"My son plays this game. Seemed like it worked good at first. Then he paid $4.99 to get a certain guy and the next day the game reset.....he had to start over and lost the pack he just bought. Ever since, he never knows if the game is going to work or not.  Disappointing!!",1399248000,,272,4.037037037037037

4304079,5,B004A8ZWW4,"My teenagers and I watched it together, and we all enjoyed it. In fact, if you are going to watch it, (and if you have children), I suggest watching with your kids. I am not sure that I would have enjoyed it nearly as much watching it on my own. Jackman's character has enough strengths and weaknesses to make him believable and Dakota Goyo is just as convincing playing a son wanting to have a relationship with his dad and to build something meaningful together.",1397520000,,464,4.470588235294118
4304080,1,B004A8ZWW4,"jackman plays the biggest pos ever!!!!
you end up hating the character soooo much in the first hour, you'd have to be a saint to forgive him in the second
some where in the concept there is a good movie but what we end up with is some depressing story about the old tagline ""Does the end justify the means?""... no it doesn't
Cool Robots though...
only tolerable if you watch it on mute.",1397433600,,386,4.22972972972973

4304082,3,B004A8ZWW4,"Overall, the movie has a storyline you have seen before.  Man battling his personal problems, inject a son he has not been there for, ups and downs, in the end.....(not going to say).  The robot fighters make it a bit unique, and adds the excitement to the movie.

That being said, I felt there was more that could have been done to understand why the world is so crazed about these robots.  Additionally, they are very advanced, yet only (apparently) used for boxing?!?  Why are they not in everyone's house doing housework, or on the street, cleaning up the city.  To me, seems like a waste of a good resource.

For the kids, the movie is good.  My son loves it.  He rates it his number 3 movie of all time (Transformers, Avengers). I do caution that the movie has violence (fighting, bullying) and mild language.  Additionally, there are some shady deals and betting, that may need to be explained. I'd best recommend this movie for 4th grade and up.",1397001600,,953,4.552941176470588
4304083,4,B004A8ZWW4,"Unusual film for Hugh Jackman, taking second place to a bevy of robotic prize fighters.
