7999642,4,B0000D0YWH,"I bought this video to show to my Spanish classes, but I never showed it to them.  It is very corny and so dated, the fashions and hairstyles would just distract them from the storyline, which is actually pretty good.  Maricela is the daughter of an immigrant cleaning lady, and they move into the rich family's home.  The daughter of the rich family is stuck-up and mean to Maricela, but in the end they become friends.",1416096000,,420,4.5
7999643,5,B0000D0YWH,"The movie came in quickly! The shipping was very efficient.

I am a Spanish teacher, and I leave this movie as my emergency sub plans along with a worksheet. It's quick, appropriate, culturally-relevant, and actually has an interesting story line that appeals to middle and high schoolers.",1404000000,3,289,5.148936170212766
7999644,5,B0000D0YWH,"This is my second copy of the movie.  My first was VHS.  This movie shows the prejudice against others of a different background and social status.  Maricela's mother is a teacher who must work as a maid in the United States.  Maricela is plagued by memories of the day her little brother ran away from her and was killed. The biggest issues deal with social justice and the ability to accept other cultures.  It is a lesson well portrayed about the senselessness of prejudgment.  If you prejudge, you miss the possibility of a beautiful friendship.",1340409600,3,549,4.726315789473684
