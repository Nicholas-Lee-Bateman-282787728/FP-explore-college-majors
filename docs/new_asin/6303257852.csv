609764,3,6303257852,"""Varan the Unbelievable"" went through several title changes, including ""Varan the Somewhat Incredible,"" ""Varan the Hard to Swallow,"" and ""Varan -- You Gotta Be Kidding Me."" Actually, the title of this movie is ""Daikaiju Baran,"" which is Japanese for ""Boy, it's hot in this rubber suit,"" and it's one of the all-time best non-Godzilla giant monster movies. Not quite as good as ""Gorgo,"" a little better than ""Rodan."" Seriously, didja ever think you'd see this released to home video in its original version? Didja?? But Media Blasters came through. And here on one inexpensive disc is the original theatrical cut and the original Japanese TV edit, all in Japanese, all in glorious black & white, and, despite what Amazon says above, not a Myron Healey is sight. Interesting footnote: Akira Ifukube here introduces the musical theme which would later be identified with King Ghidorah. Three & a half stars, really, if Amazon would let me.",1119225600,9,936,5.04516129032258
609765,5,6303257852,"This DVD release is the original Japanese version and not the butchered American version with added scenes of Myron Healey
as a US soldier investigating a salty island lake. This version is so
different  you won't believe it.  The plot is completely different.  It
takes place in the mountains, not on an island.  There is just no comparing the two versions. They are nothing alike.  It would have
 been nice if they had included the american TV version on this
disc for comparison, but alas.  They don't even kill the monster in the american version. Come to think of it, They really didn't even use
very much of the original footage in making the American version.
Most confusing about this DVD is the decision to use the US title
VARAN: THE UNBELIEVABLE, since that is a completely different version. A more correct translation of the title of this version would be
VARAN: THE GIANT MONSTER or GIANT MONSTER VARAN.
It contains two versions an earlier, incomplete work print for an abandoned TV version and the Japanese theatrical cut. Both are only subtitled.
They should have dubbed it.

Its interesting to note that after I wrote this review, Amazon took down the name Myron Healey.
Now it is back again. I don't get it.",1115164800,50,1225,4.71830985915493
609766,3,6303257852,"This is not the American version titled ""Varan the Unbelievable"" that was released in the USA in 1961.  This will be the original 1958 Japanese version ""Daikaiju Varan"" (Giant Monster Varan), so none of the edited footage and story involving the American naval officer on the ""island of Kunish Hiroshima"" will be present in this.  Also, for those that're only familiar with ""Varan the Unbelievable"", since this will be the original Japanese version there will be lots of footage you've never seen such as Varan's flying sequence, and you will also get to hear Akira Ifukube's original musical score.  And just so you know, this DVD will more than likely be bilingual so there will likely be a dub, though it's possible it'll be a brand new English dub recorded in LA by studios and actors that most often dub anime (Japanese animation) as was the case with the recent DVD of The Mysterians.  There'll also likely be a few nice extras on this like Media Blasters'/Tokyo Shock's impressive DVDs for The Mysterians and Matango: Attack of the Mushroom People.",1111881600,23,1055,4.844444444444444

I recorded ""Varan the Unbelievable"" many many years ago from one of the local late shows and pull it out every once in a while when I in the mood for an old Japanese made movie. It is pretty much the remake of Godzilla with some elements of Rodan thrown in.

I like these old ""Godzilla like movies"" and probably rate them higher than most other would.

What seems like a good monster movie is chopped down to a somewhat boring yarn. The monster is cool looking, although he is sluggish.  Varan doesn't have much screen time either.  This dub most resembles Godzilla, King of the Monsters.  The focus shift, inserted American-made scenes, and since the Japanese characters are just nonentities, they didn't even bother dubbing their dialogue.  Real cheap...

While traipsing around looking for butterflies, two students come upon something unexpected and are squished.  A small expedition returns to the site hoping to find answers.

Varan quickly destroys the local village and the inhospitable village priest.  Naturally, the military gets involved.  And because they are ecologically minded, the pour toxins into the river to kill the fish and drive the beastie from its lair.

610160,2,6303257852,"(Note: This is a review of the Japanese version) Ohhh....I went into this film with the highest hopes and excitement for a good Daikaiju movie. I had just watched Frankenstein vs. Baragon and War of the Gargantuas for the first time and loved them! So, I'm coming to Varan fresh off the heels of those two great giant monster films, I've always wanted to see this film since I saw Destroy All Monsters!  I love the Varan design and there is a lot of fun in a monster that's like a spike covered version of Godzilla that can fly like a flying squirrel! That concept is awesome and Varan's appearances in other media have always been fun..but despite all my hope for this film, it just wasn't good. In fact, worse than that, it was dreadfully boring, repetitive and makes Godzilla Raids Again look like a masterpiece in comparison. Now I like Godzilla Raids Again, but it's definitely on the lower end of the Godzilla films for me, but this just seems lazy, poorly directed, mediocre Kaiju effects with forgettable characters and a very bizarre and out of place start. And that's weird to say considering that the director was Ishiro Honda, the man who created Godzilla, he's a great director...but this is just ugh, on the very low end. The best part of the film is undoubtedly when Varan first appears, runs over a crazy priest worshiping him, is attacked by the military and then flies off like the a flying squirrel, the only time he does his trademark thing by the way! The middle part of the film we spend in Kaiju stereotype land, boring military talky scenes, an scientific explanation of what Varan is, plans to kill him. Now I would be willing to overlook that if the film had a great payoff at the end, I was waiting for great scenes of Varan crashing through Tokyo, knocking through buildings and then when cornered, flying away in the sky to a new part of the city...but we don't get that at all! What we get for our ending is 20 minutes of seeing Varan slowly swim towards the Tokyo shore while the military fire missiles and drop bombs on him, 20 whole minutes of nothing but this! There are several cool scenes of seeing Varan underwater as the you see the bombs slowly doping to the side of him but that's it! When he finally gets to the shore, I'm like, okay good, Varan is FINALLY on the shore, now it's going to get good. All he does is destroy just 5 buildings right next to the water while he gets attacked by Gojira stock footage! Now I heard going into this that there would be stock footage from Gojira but good god, half the ending scene is filled with it! I'm willing to overlook a few scenes like how I did with Godzilla vs. Gigan, but when you see Godzilla's tail, a tail that is so distinctly not Varan's tail, destroy a building that was where I gave up on this film. Besides flying, Varan has no special powers, abilities, no breath weapons, just kinda crashing through the city. And the way they kill him is by having him shallow a bomb. Even the way they get rid of Varan isn't interesting! The most positive thing I can say about this film is the lovely music by Akira Ifukabe, who is good as always! I would personally give this film a skip, it's so generic it hurts. I'm glad they expanded and included Varan in more things besides this because this film was not his finest hour at all!",1471132800,5,3321,4.417618270799347

610495,4,6303257852,"so amazon is mashing together reviews for ""Daikaij Baran"" and ""Varan the Unbelievable."" Which is about as inaccurate and nonsensical as putting reviews for editions of ""Gojira"" and ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" in the same place, despite the fact that they are essentially two completely different films.  If you are buying the 10 dollar copy from synergy entertainment, despite what the top review claims, you are NOT buying the original japanese version. It is the american cut with Myron Healy, not the original Japanese movie.  It also has a weird watermark in the bottom corner of the screen for most of the film. Charging 10 bucks for it is absurd, nobody should pay more than 5 bucks for such a shoddy edition. (That being said, all reviews stating that this is the original japanese version are reviews of an edition released a few years ago that is now out of print, and thus quite pricey) The Varan vs. Baran thing may not seem like a big deal to some, but kaiju afocionados make a very serious distinction between original japanese releases and their american-cut counterparts, as the result is two completely different presentations, with different characters and stories. The fact that amazon presents the original japanese cut as one and the same with the hacked up american version is just irresponsibly misleading to collectors. I tried informing customer service, and whoever replied CLEARLY did not understand the actual issue. So if you are like me, and were led to believe (based on a top review of the product) that you were buying a japanese film and not a hacked up american version, complain to amazon so that the issue can be addressed, and people will know what they are actually buying. The way it is set up now is almost deliberately deceptive, and customer service has been of no help at all despite numerous complaints.

It's hard to describe ""Varan The Unbelievable"" since this is the American version of the movie with added scenes of Myron Healey as a US soldier/scientist who is  investigating converting a salty island lake into drinkable fresh water using chemical explosives.  Naturally, a giant monster is awakened.
This movie attempts to be what the original Americanized version of the original black & white Godzilla was.
Unlike Godzilla, it doesn't succeed.  ""Varan"" is a hodge-podge of two different monster movies.  Granted this Americanized version was bold for portraying a married interracial husband and wife who actually kissed on screen - it offers little else.

No attempt is made at a smooth pan and scan of the image. The image jumps from one side of the frame to the other. The print is on the soft side and full of splices. The original score has been replaced with cues from THE AMAZING COLOSSAL MAN and its sequel. Unless you're dying to see this stinker SAVE YOUR MONEY.

610629,2,6303257852,"This is not a review on the film itself, but rather a review on the Synergy DVD-R here.

This particular product might be of some interest to collectors of rare cinema, as this is the first official DVD release of Crown International's VARAN, THE UNBELIEVABLE. But for those who still own VCRs (I do), I recommend saving your money and buying a uses VHS of this film. Because this DVD is simply that; a transfer from the pan-and-scan video tape master of this film.

VARAN was originally made by Toho (the company that gave us Godzilla) in 1957. That Japanese version is available on DVD by Media Blasters, in all its widescreen glory. Unlike any of the Godzilla films, Varan never got an English dub. Instead, when it was purchased by Crown International, it was for the most part reshot in English, by an American cast and crew. Essentially, this 1962 version starring Myron Healey is a completely different movie, only using 15 minutes of the monster footage from the Japanese film.

See, before the advent of DVDs and Widescreen television screens, TVs all had the 4:3 aspect ratio; meaning they all were squared. And whenever a widescreen filmed movie was put on VHS, the common practice was to crop the rectangular image of the movie to a smaller square in order to fill the TV screen. Now, some of these crop jobs (know as ""pan-and-scanning"") were better than others. Sometimes the image would shift back and forth from left to right at appropriate times, just to keep every important subject in frame. The trick was to not look like something had been cut off of frame. But in all cases, the rest of the picture frame is missing.

This is one of those ""bad"" pan-and-scan jobs. The framing is all off. People are cut in half on the edges of the screen. Sometimes the image jump cuts from one side of the frame to the other. This is a very annoying viewing experience, leaving one so frustrated that so much of the picture is cropped out. This is even worse for the Japanese effects footage. See, Toho had initially intended this film for television and parts of it were shot in the 4:3 aspect ratio to begin with. But when they decided to go theatrical and film the rest in widescreen, the remaining standard footage had to be cropped to accommodate the rest. So when it comes to the Varan footage, it's a cropped image of a cropped image.

I'm not going to insult the Synergy people for their release of this film. They got all they could get their hands on with the money that they had. The film has never been on DVD or VOD before, so here it is for your curiosity. But this does call for an upgrade. It is time that this version of the film be remastered for the next DVD or Blu-Ray release.",1415059200,,2702,4.494908350305499
610630,2,6303257852,"Despite all of the many comments, this Synergy Archive version IS the American dubbed version of the movie. Perhaps the comments from other versions have been merged in with the Synergy version?

There is not a Japanese language version on the disk, which disappointed me as I wanted to see that version. The dubbed version is really bad as the actor is simply filling in the story for the parts of the Japanese version, which were poorly edited in when needed. The characters in the American version kept mentioning characters in the Japanese version, who obviously were the ones that ""saved the day"" in the original cut, but were really left out in this version.

As far as the video itself, the quality was good, but I wish it was widescreen. The menu was fast in coming up and started the movie right away, so that is good. The case was professional looking and the disk packaged well. I would have rated this DVD higher (3 stars instead of two) if it weren't for the annoying Synergy logo that kept coming up during the presentation! Come on, I PAID for this movie...I do not want to see logos during it. I was almost mad enough at that one annoyance to rate it a one...but I let my anger fade before I rated this.

It is a made on demand dvd meaning that once you order it they start making it and then they send you it. Does this mean it is a bootleg? No not at all. I'm sure if they released this movie in abundance the company would lose a lot of money so whoever purchases this from amazon they make it specifically for that person so that the company doesn't have to waste time and money on bundles. It is on a DVD-R disc which is usually region free so it should work in almost any DVD player. Hopefully they do this with Rebirth Of Mothra III or even Gorath.

This is the American English dubbed version of the film which isn't as good as the original Japanese version but it is still an enjoyable Kaiju (Giant Monster) movie nonetheless. The picture is the best quality I've ever seen it in especially for being a black and white film and it is full screen not wide screen. The case and disc look very good and authentic and looks really good next to my other giant monster films and will look great next to yours for sure.

610879,3,6303257852,"Contrary to comments in at least one of the earlier reviews here, this is indeed the American/English language version of Varan.  Having recently watched the original Japanese film, which is defintely superior, it was still quite interesting to see this variant, and well worth the modest cost to add it to my collection of ""Japanese Giant Monster (Kaiju)"" films.  Unlike the American versions of Gojira (Godzilla) and Gamera that similarly inserted English-speaking actors, this one is much more of an American-made product, using very little footage with the Japanese cast (no dubbed scenes at all and no shots of stand-ins with their backs to the camera) and not even containing all of the original effects shots (most notably cutting Varan's flying scenes).  In fact, a couple of new effects shots appear that matte in a giant claw/glove to menace the heroes as they hide in a cave.  As a result of this ""re-make"" approach, the plot and other key elements in this version are significantly altered from those in the Japanese film.  And though these changes are mostly not for the better, it was still a hoot to see Myron Healy and company running around Bronson Canyon and ducking from Varan into one of its frequently utilized cave-like tunnel entrances.  With regard to the quality of the print, this is a ""pan and scan"" (probably TV) version (the Japanese film was widescreen) that is a little beat-up (not too bad though).  The American-shot scenes (which constitute the majority of the film) are rather brighter and easier to see than the Japansese footage that contains the ""monster"" action (this being especially the case with nighttime scenes).  Nonetheless, the overall picture quality is definitely good enough to allow for an entertaining viewing experience.  There are absolutely no extras included here, not even a chapter menu (though there are a modest number of chapter stops).  I would recommend this to fans of late 50s early 60s sci-fi of the ""cheesy"" variety (count me in that number), and strongly suggest it to anyone who is looking for a nice supplement to the currently avialble DVD release of the Japansese version, which (unlike recent releases of Gojira) does not include this parallel American variant.",1370995200,4,2234,5.029810298102981

Then, I got more collective. I originally found out how many movies there were because of ""Godzillathon"" on Youtube (I'd rate it R for language).

610956,4,6303257852,"One of the more obscure monster movies of the 1950s, ""The Monster Baran"" as it was known in Japan was an anamoly.  Sandwiched in-between Honda's colorful ""Mysterians"" and the gaudy ""H-Man"" Varan was a black-and-white film in widescreen.  Orignally intended as a co-international TV production with ABC-TV, the project fell through only to be resurrected for theatrical release.

""Varan"" was as close as Honda would ever come to directing a run-of-the-mill monster movie, there is no subtext, no hidden message, no grander vision as would be seen in his other fantasy films.  Instead ""Varan"" was hastily made utelizing a great deal of stock footage (particulary from ""Godzilla"" and ""Gigantis the Fire Monster"").

Even so the film has many splendid moments; in particular Akira Ifukube's film score, one of the finest ever composed for a monster film.  The DVD print is tremendous and the extras are not to be missed.  Even with a restrained budget and shooting schedule, Honda and his team create a film that contains memorable moments of suspense and action.

By far not Honda's best monster film but far from his worst, ""Varan"" is - as with all of Honda's fantasy films - worth a look.

610957,3,6303257852,"This review is based on the uncut, Japanese version that Media Blasters\Tokyo Shock released in 2005.

I saw ""Varan: The Unbelievable"", for the first time, a few nights ago and I have to agree, that this is a very boring kaiju film. Ishiro Honda (director of ""Gojira"" and other classic Godzilla\Toho films) gives us an un-interesting story, barely developed-characters and a (mostly) un-inspired creature design.

The creature is mainly, a quadruped, which can also be bipedal and...has the ability to glide, via fleshy-membranes that are between it's limbs. Sadly, this rather cool design feature is only seen for a few seconds. The roar that Varan makes sounds like a cross-between, Godzilla\Rodan.

Besides the excellent music score and detailed minatures, there really isn't that much to praise about the film.

The monster fails to create any kind of powerful impact on-screen. It's destruction sequences are lacking in suspense. In fact, a lot of stock-footage is used\re-used, during many of the action scenes (including, a clip of Godzilla's tail from ""Gojira"").

For Godzilla\Toho\kaiju fans, if you haven't seen this film, at least see it once and just add it to your collection, anyway.

While it is a shame that Varan wasn't seen\used very much in later Toho productions (other than appearing in Destroy All Monsters), at least Honda\Toho created another kaiju that wasn't exactly, Godzilla.

It's one of Toho's most disappointing films, but it's also unique, because it stars a monster that never became very popular, afterward.",1333411200,2,1541,5.26530612244898

611035,4,6303257852,"One of Toho's most obscure giant monster flicks, the original Japanese version of Varan, The Unbelievable has long been an object of desire for collectors. The Tokyo Shock DVD presents the original black-and-white film, uncut (sans Myron Healy, who starred in the 1962 American version), in anamorphic widescreen, with numerous extras, including an abridged, alternately scored version originally made for Japanese television release.

The 1962 American release of Varan, The Unbelievable featured bits and pieces of Toho's Daikaiju Baran, but in the context of an entirely new movie starring Myron Healy. The result was an insipid B-flick with some exceptional monster scenes. Virtually none of the original plot or characters survived the Americanization, and stock music by Albert Glasser had replaced Akira Ifukube's dark, atmospheric score. Also missing was a brief but memorable scene of the monster taking flight.

Toho's last black and white daikaiju film, Varan features some of Eiji Tsuburaya's most impressive special effects work, and the monster suit is quite elegant, usually shot at high speed and from low angles to convey a sense of great size. The human drama, however, falls far short of Toho's usual standard, partly due to a lackluster cast--especially the stony-faced Kz Nomura as the lead protagonist, and Koreya Senda as the inevitable scientist, whose screen presence utterly fails to engage. Regardless, the Tokyo Shock DVD of Varan is itself a superior product, and the movie's visual strengths certainly make it a more-than-worthy entry in Toho's daikaiju universe.",1265500800,3,1593,5.471544715447155

I would have loved to seen the big lizard fly a few times more since he could have probably created an alternate ending more favorable to him than the one director-legend Ishiro Honda preferred.
Like many films in this era, there are lots of calm-but worried scientists in lab coats diagnosing the big-monster-in-our-backyard-problem, miniature military/armor preparing for and engaging in battle, and of course a giant monster destroying the most populated city on the planet.
Maybe the weakest scene in this mega-monster flick was the under water scene where Varan seems to be amused by an attempt by the Japanese Navy to depth charge to death the great monster. Varan chose to sit comfortably by a rock on the sea bottom google-eyed and just casually watch as explosions took place by his face (no damage was done to his magnificent make-up job).

611043,5,6303257852,"Perhaps this version of ""Varan"" is only of interest to bad-movie buffs, but they shouldn't pass this up.

This ""Varan"" has been wildly altered, with Albert Glasser stock music and a new storyline featuring Myron Healy as an overstressed military officer subjecting a ""native"" village lake (although the actors and character names in the new footage are clearly Japanese, references to Japan and Tokyo have been erased) to a controversial desalinization treatment, the adorable Tsuruko Kobayashi as his long-suffering local bride, a thankfully brief appearance by a very annoying little boy (ironically NOT an element in the original version!), and the clumsiest ninja ever caught on film; on the other hand, the monster's notorious ""gliding"" scene has been cut.

Nonetheless, the new footage is great fun, especially the scenes of Healy's character's condescension to ""locals"" and raving frustration as the desalinization tests don't pan out--as well as the normal trappings of giant monster movies of the time, such as the ""it could happen again tomorrow"" speech at the end.

I think this version actually works better than the original Japanese one; this time the human drama is at least moderately engaging (and always funny), and the whole thing is thankfully shorter but you still get all the giant-monster action (apart from the aforementioned ""gliding"" scene).

611076,4,6303257852,"Not the best of all but definitely a good one and worth seeing. I didn't notice a lack of dubbing because I never watch these dubbed--Americans tend to see these films as camp and dub away with that in mind. Most dubs of Japanese flicks of this type I've encountered have been awful, worst of all was a recent Godzilla release that was dubbed and chopped up horribly by an arrogant American who actually brags about his butchery and lousy jokes on one of the tracks.

In the Fifties films like ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""The Thing"" were not made as budget no-brainers and we shouldn't assume that the Japanese were always simply screwing around either. ""Godzilla"" in its original form is a serious and at times horrifying film; many later efforts have spectacular art direction, imaginative design, fine acting (you'll see many serious Japanese actors in these movies), and fascinating plots... along with some nice humor to break things up. Tokyo Shock is doing a terrific job here with this series--I'm buying every one--and if they need a PR man they should get in touch because I will rave as eloquently as possible. So far the releases have been wonderful; I never dreamed I'd see a conscientiously cleaned-up offering of ""Mysterians"" or ""Matango"" or ""Dogora"" in my lifetime. This is significant film, a lot of effort went into much of it (more so than in any American B-movie fare that it tends to be unfairly lumped with) and should be seen and appreciated as something more than mere goofy Friday night beer and pizza entertainment.

One extra note: About the constant ""guy-in-the-rubber-suit"" quips and jibes. I've worked on some hefty creative production so I kind of know what I'm talking about here--stop and think, you want a big monster trashing the hell out of a city. If you stop-motion the monster you either have to optically print the destruction (which means a loss of sense of immediacy in the way the monster interacts with its environment) or stop-motion animate the destruction, which, as Ray Harryhausen has many times told us, is insanely difficult and never looks right. Think of the buildings being demolished in ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers""--a little stiff and wooden. Pre-CGI (and frankly that has its limitations--everything looks like a video game for one, and it lacks guts and resonance) the best way to have a monster wreck a city and give it some real visceral heft is...yes, a guy in a rubber suit smashing away at superb miniatures. This was never a cheesy low-budget decision (although it incidentally translated to lower budget films well), it was a calculated design and aesthetic choice and in the best of the films it is not only effective but quite riveting--even though it's not precisely ""realistic"" whatever the hell that means in a fantasy/sci-fi offering. So all I'm saying is next time you feel like getting snide or uppity about the rubber suit shtick, the explosions, or any other tough details in these wonderful films, sit down with a budget, timetable, and pack of grouchy production experts and please try to come up with a better way to do it! Also, take a hard look at that miniature Tokyo or Osaka or Hokado the monster is trashing and ask hard questions about time and money. Those toy cities were works of art.

While I'm grouchy one more thing--with few exceptions, like ""Team America,"" you're not going to see much real ""fantasy"" stuff on the screen anymore. It's all Green Screen or location shooting nowadays. I don't think many people have completely thought through what this means. What's more exciting, a chase involving 50 horsemen that you know are real or one involving 5000 horsemen that you know must be a computer generated image...or a real spaceship (albeit in miniature) blowing up or a hundred CGI images of spaceships doing same. Deep down, your brain can tell the difference. All those fantastic people who knew how to design and build miniatures and crazy sets (like you see in 50s and 60s films) and make real explosions and do great stunts are disappearing--fast. It's all artificial, like artificial flavoring, and something something that gets to your gut is missing.

I might add, this DVD lacks an English dub, so those who watch dub-only versions may want to avoid this.",1130457600,10,524,4.585106382978723
611078,4,6303257852,"VARAN THE UNBELIEVABLE is one of the lesser seen films by japanese director Ishiro Honda. Allthough it it not as strong as his classic GODZILLA from 1954, it is an interesting film nicely filmed in black and white. It is also great tosee the original version and not the americanized one.

All in all the budget must have been not as big as in later films produced by the Toho company, but it is worth watching and quite entertaining.",1121817600,3,434,4.493670886075949
611079,3,6303257852,"I was exhilirated when I found out that Varan would be coming to DVD; and from Media Blasters who did a fantastic job on Matango and The Mysterians. Unfortunately, Media Blasters got very lazy and didn't provide an English dub to this film. While the English subs are nice, I don't think movies were intended to be read. For the lack of a dub, I doubt I will watch it as many times as I've watched my dubbed kaiju films. To this day I am still disappointed at Media Blasters for not providing an English dub.

As for the movie itself, well, it was made, originally, for television in its early production stages; that was until one of the American companies involved with the making of the film backed out and plans were changed to release it into theaters. The budget was much smaller than that of other kaiju production done by Toho of the day. Despite the low budget, the movie does deliver some nice, but very few, miniatures and a suit that is good, but obviously shows it is made of several pieces on film. The story moves fast at first, but it begins to severely drag and get a little tiresome. Nevertheless, it is a good daikaiju film but not one of Toho's gems like Rodan or Godzilla. Definitely worth a look if you are a fan of Japanese daikaiju films.",1121299200,5,1262,4.3931623931623935
611080,3,6303257852,"Well, someone screwed up here, and it wasn't me (for once)...the film is listed here as Varan the Unbelievable (1962) but what is actually on the DVD is a different film titled Daikaij Baran (1958), also known as Baran: Monster from the East or The Great Monster Baran...the plots for the two films are very similar (giant monster running amok...gee, that's plot for most any of these films), but the film with the creature Varan features the American actor Myron Healey while the film actually on this DVD does not...directed by Ishir Honda (Godzilla, Rodan! The Flying Monster), the film stars Kz Nomura, Ayumi Sonoda, and Koreya Senda, all of whom, along with much of the supporting cast, also appearing in Varan the Unbelievable, further adding to the confusion...I wouldn't doubt if footage from Daikaij Baran was spliced together with footage shot at a later date to create Varan the Unbelievable, as this practice was not an unusual one, hacking up Japanese films of the time to make them more palatable to American audiences.

All right, now that is cleared up, I can proceed...the film begins with Japanese text scrolling across the screen, none of which I can read, so I'm wondering how much of the story I just missed...this goes on for about a minute and a half and then we see scenes of a rocket taking off from Earth (I'm not sure why, as this seemed to have nothing to do with the rest of the film).  After this we cut to a university where Dr. Sugimoto (Senda) is teaching a class, talking about butterflies...apparently some especially rare ones have been found in a remote area, so they sent a couple of researchers to find more.  The researchers have arrived in a village near the area, but the locals don't seem all that friendly...weird, but not friendly...after a brief search of the area the do find one of the butterflies (conveniently attached to a string), but they also find something else, something that causes an avalanche, killing the two men.  A second team is sent, a trio of individuals including Yuriko (Sonoda), a reporter whose brother was one of the two original researchers killed (is she going for the scoop, or her dead brother?), Kenji (Nomura), a university representative who's got the hots for Yuriko, and some portly, bespeckled psuedo comic relief type you hope (and pray) dies quickly but never does...anyway, the trio arrive at the village and find the locals praying to a god named Baradagi, hoping to avoid his divine wraith (which is coming soon, or so my gut tells me).  Kenji mocks their belief system and there's a boring bit about a lost boy and his dog (the boy is so amazingly annoying I would have left him lost) which all equates to an awakening of a prehistoric beast living at the bottom of a nearby lake.  Well, I guess the Japanese aren't partial to giant beasts, so they send the army in and there is a confrontation, but the creature escapes and its learned conventional weapons are pretty much useless...oh yeah, this seemingly land/sea based creature also has wings and can fly...a monster of all seasons, if you will.  Anyway, from Anti-Varan Headquarters (no foolin') we learn, after a few skirmishes with stock footage and miniature ships, the creature is seriously honked off headed directly for Tokyo (oh no!) and probably not in an effort to make friendly nice nice...

While I did enjoy certain elements of this film a lot like the effects, the music, various shots, overall it just felt kinda...boring...a very cut and dry Japanese monster film...one that's very well done, but still lacks zing.  The way I see it, the story is a perfect example of a situation where everyone's interests might have been best served by leaving well enough alone.  Here we've got a creature in a highly remote area, content to live at the bottom of a relatively isolated lake, prayed to by idiotic local villagers...until the army learns of its existence, to which not only do they book up there with all kinds of weapons, but they actually use chemicals to drive the creature from the lake and soon find out they bit off more than they could chew.  Were the Japanese really so eager to instigate a giant creature to thrash and trash their cities, especially on the heels of Gojira aka Godzilla?  As I said, the movie is really well done, and I think my favorite aspect was the music, provided by legendary composer Akira Ifukube.  One thing I felt while watching the movie was a sense that a whole lot of effort was put forth in nearly every area of the film, right down to the highly detailed miniatures.  The film does move slowly at times, lurching forward on the heels of predictability.  During the film I questioned Dr. Sugimoto credentials, as he seemed to offer little in terms of useful information and/or assistance, but his unwillingness towards speculation appears to be something written in as a desirable, inherent quality of the character...but I didn't see it that way.  Sure, I could sit on the sidelines keeping a tight lip while others try to mitigate a dangerous situation, learning from their mistakes enough to finally propose a solution and looking like a hero, but that equates to just taking credit for the work of others.  I think my favorite scene had to be the one where Baran took to the sea, and came across a small fishing boat occupied by three men despondent about the lack of fish...that is until Baran sticks his head out of the water, and the men go wacky-do-nuts...the confrontation in the sea was also pretty cool, especially when the ships were dropping depth charges try to force Baran to the surface.  I also thought the creature looked decent, about as good a man in a rubber suit can...

The wide screen (2.35:1) picture on this Media Blasters DVD release looks very clear and sharp to me, and the audio come through cleanly, available in Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital stereo, Japanese 3.0 Dolby Digital mono, and Japanese mono.  There is no English dub, but there are English subtitles, which I prefer over English dubbing as its usually done so poorly it distract from the film, but to each his/her own...special features include a restored Japanese television broadcast version, trailers for the film, a lecture from monster suit sculptor Keizo Murase, along with providing an audio commentary for the film.  There are also some previews for other releases including One Missed Call (2003), The Mysterians (1957), Mantango aka Attack of the Mushroom People (1963), and Sky High (2003).
