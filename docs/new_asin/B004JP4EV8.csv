8431966,1,B004JP4EV8,"This DVD is short (25 min) That's the BEST part. I think most people that use camcorders could make a better DVD then this one. There is no creativity. There is more enjoyment reading a Highland bus schedule and whoever wrote the script that was used could NEVER have been to Scotland. Which brings me to the audio portion of this DVD. The guy read the scrip like it was his first time reading allowed. He mispronounced the names of castles, towns and regions. At any time during this, I was expecting him to refer to the local people as Scotch people!",1351296000,,552,4.421568627450981
