7904415,5,B000006GMQ,"This version of CINDERELLA was filmed in Germany by director Fritz Genschow in 1955 as ""Aschenputtel"" and later dubbed into English by the Childhood Productions company for it's series of popular kiddie matinee features in 1966.

Poor Margaret (Rita-Maria Nowotny) is mistreated horribly by her Stepmother (Anne Bruck) and her stepsisters Lottie and Dottie (Maria Axt and Renate Fischer).  When the handsome Prince Charming (Rudiger Lichti) announces that all the women in the kingdom are invited to a ball, Margaret is forbidden to attend, but kindly tree spirit Miss Holly (Renee Stobrawa) and mischevious elf Quirlyquacks ensure that Margaret sees all her dreams come true...

This version of CINDERELLA benefits from a great European storybook atmosphere and lovely performances from the entire cast, especially Rita-Maria Nowotny (married to director Genschow at the time), whose ethereal beauty and charm serve her well as Margaret/Cinderella.  Renee Stobrawa also scores heavily as Margaret's kindly fairy godmother Miss Holly.  It's a perfect example from the best of the post-war German fantasy cinema genre.

The Childhood Productions English-language dubbings were always very nicely achieved and the English ""Aschenputtel"" is enlivened by a great musical score by Ann and Milton Delugg (including ""The Story of Cinderella"", ""Beautiful, Beautiful"" and ""Bimble and Bumble"").

Totally enchanting.",1151280000,3,1405,5.725961538461538
7904416,3,B000006GMQ,"As another reviewer said, it's too short. I didn't even bother to watch the extra cartoon they tacked on. The beginning of the tape is loaded with annoying FOX commercials, but you can always speed by them as I did! If you want a cute, SHORT version of Cinderella, go ahead and get it. But, if you're looking for more, you may be disappointed.
Nice drawing style though. The style of animation appears to be similar to Japanese Anime (Pretty, large eyes, particularly on Cinderella). I bought it mostly out of curiosity. And my curiosity has been adequately satisfied.",1000857600,20,568,4.747474747474747
7904417,1,B000006GMQ,"this is the Saban (of Power Ranger fame) version and is so short that another cartoon short is added to make it 30 minutes total. Cheap is Cheap, and this is a cheap rip off on Disney.",979171200,96,184,4.0
