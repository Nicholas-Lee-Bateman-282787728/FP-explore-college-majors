8330472,5,B001OC9AYA,"OK.  Now I've seen the Producer's Picks.  I'd really like to see the directors' favorites.  Different motivation behind the selecting, I think.  Nonetheless, this was an extraordinary value.  Kudos to the producer for including the period Chevy and Bayer Aspirin commercials.  Those ads plus the location settings make this a great time travel package.

Worth having.  Now, please, someone produce DVDs of Then Came Bronson, the whole one-season series, please.",1424736000,,461,5.485714285714286
8330473,3,B001OC9AYA,"I didn't get to see it, because the DVD was in a million pieces when it got to my house. I guets I'll have to see the re-runs on TV. I would have probably  given it 5 stars if I could have watched it. It's a great memory maker!",1421280000,,227,3.63265306122449
8330474,4,B001OC9AYA,"I like the series, but not enough to buy the whole thing, so this is a great compromise.  The episodes chosen are well selected, and represent sme of the best, with the best guest stars.",1363824000,,186,4.314285714285714
8330475,5,B001OC9AYA,"This series was always interesting to watch, and as that new weekly location (across the US) ocurred, what was encountered upon their arrival was also a journey and life experience for all viewers.",1357171200,,197,5.0
8330476,5,B001OC9AYA,"""Route 66"", which may or may not have been inspired by Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"", remains a refreshing relic of early 1960's America, when JFK was the young President and fresh breezes definitely were in the air.

""Route 66"" was apparently the brainchild of writer/producer Stirling Silliphant, who previously had worked on the ""Naked City"" tv series.  ""Route 66"" evolved from the simple concept of two young stars (Martin Milner and George Maharis) taking a freewheeling tour of the U.S. in a Corvette (effectively the third star of the show).  Along the way, Todd (Milner) and Buzz (Maharis) would interact with new people they met on the road, often acting as a catalyst in solving problems.  George Maharis was clearly the standout star, but problems dictated his replacement (by Glenn Corbett) midway into the series' run.

Stirling Silliphant himself scouted cities around the U.S. looking for locations to shoot.  The fresh approach to locations (indoor and outdoor) and a cinema verite' approach to camerawork were instrumental in the show's success.  So, too, were the very strong scripts and characters which Silliphant and others created.

""Producers' Picks"" offers eleven 'cream of the crop' ""Route 66"" episodes. Here are some highlights:

""Soda Pop and Paper Flags"", where Todd and Linc (Glenn Corbett) defend a drifter from accusations that he carried a deadly sickness into a small town.

""In Cage in Search of a Bird"" features a very young Stephanie Powers capturing a young girl who seems the essence of the early 60's, set in Denver.  Many ""Route 66"" episodes featured strong female characters.

""Birdcage on My Foot"", with Robert Duvall, addressed drug addiction and withdrawal, with excellent views of Boston.  In another ""Route 66"" episode (not found on these two discs), Martin Milner's ""Todd"" was dosed with an experimental hallucinogen.

""And the Cat Jumped Over the Moon"" is about gangs, with James Caan dueling Martin Sheen (who wears a ridiculously bad haircut) in a game of 'chicken', set in Philadelphia.

""Play it Glissando"" with Jack Lord and Anne Francis (curiously trumped by Barbara Bostock in the disc billing).  This show reveals how conservative things remained in the early 60's.  Lord plays a hotshot trumpeter with marital problems.  ""Buzz"" (Maharis) shows his hipster side, rattling off the names of the 'coolest' horn-players, beginning with Maynard Ferguson, Chet Baker... before finally mentioning Miles Davis.  Ferguson barely makes most Top Twenty lists today, and was known principally for hitting high notes.

""You Never Had it So Good"", where Peter Graves plays a Mitt Romney-like character who develops properties.  George Maharis' ""Buzz"" morphs into a surprisingly believeable intern, only to find he has been used by ambitious female exec, Patricia Barry.  This episode has surprising echoes of Ayn Rand.

""Lizard's Leg and Owlet's Wing"" has Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, and Lon Chaney starring as themselves.  While ""Todd"" attends to the horror icons, ""Buzz"" shepherds a convention of executive secretaries, affording a glimpse into how feminism was viewed at the time.

Overall, all these episodes hold up well, and provide fascinating glimpses of well known actors before they became stars.  My only disappointment is that none of these episodes features a black actor, and ""Route 66"" broke ground a few times by doing just that.  Stirling Silliphant went on to write the script for ""In the Heat of the Night"".",1354233600,,3467,5.2111913357400725
8330477,5,B001OC9AYA,What can one say. A great DVD collection of great Route 66 episodes. Each special and with an impressive list of guest stars. I love the places you get to see along with the great stories.,1330041600,,188,4.25
8330478,1,B001OC9AYA,"I purchased this DVD with hopes of enjoying a portion of the Route 66 series that I loved back in the '60s. Much to my disappointment, the DVD will not play in any of my DVD players: it fails to load, not even the main menu. However, it did play in a computer. I suspect it was burned improperly on a home computer.",1328486400,,315,4.015873015873016

8330480,5,B001OC9AYA,"If you were in your early 20's when these TV shows were made, seeing them again brings back fond memories. It also shows off many actors who were in their early roles, like Robert Duvall.

Great videos.",1268438400,,202,4.45945945945946
8330481,5,B001OC9AYA,"I'll keep it simple and to the point. Every episode has a little known guest star that became big, except for one special episode. The producers paid an omage to the classic Universal Horror films by writing an episode for Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney,Jr., and Peter Lorre at the end of their careers playing themselves and allowing Chaney to dress up in his most famous monsters including ""The Wolfman"". Just for that episode its worth its wait in gold.",1260230400,10,451,4.7215189873417724
