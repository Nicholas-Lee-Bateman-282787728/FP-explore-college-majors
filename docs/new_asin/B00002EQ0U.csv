7915742,5,B00002EQ0U,It is cowboy bebop! An epic anime! It is worth collecting on vhs! And wow! I am the first to comment in 15 years here!,1462406400,,118,3.76
7915743,5,B00002EQ0U,"Finally, we get to see that there is more to this show then just bounty hunting. There is also a great story and plot that tends to drag away from bounty hunting a little, but no upsetting fans of the show. After Mao Yenrai, a head of a syndicate, is murdered by Vicious, Spike is determined to take Vicious out. The best thing about this episode was the gun fight in the church that John Woo could only dream of. Next up, Spike encounters Wen, a child who cannot age due to a disease he caught from the gate accident. There is a lot of action and some extremely cool music for every scene. And the voice actor for Wen, who also plays the voice of Izzy on Digimon, gives Wen the right ammount of serious emotion. With crows, guns, crystals, gun fights, harmonicas, flashbacks and Faye in a sleek costume during episode 5, how could you not like this?",981849600,,850,4.31875
7915744,5,B00002EQ0U,"One of the first glimpes into Spike's past takes place in 'Ballad of Fallen Angels', making it (in my humble opinion, at least) the best episode in the series.
Confronted with figures from his past, Spike takes part in a showdown with Vicious, a man just as dangerous as he (plus armed with a badass katana).
As always, the animation in Cowboy Bebop is a solid mix of hand drawn and CGI. The action is fast-paced, and the characters interesting. However, the ever-present music in Cowboy Bebop takes attention away from all the other elements. Very diverse, it creates the perfect atmosphere to which your jaw can drop to the floor by.
The fact is Cowboy Bebop is one of the best anime (or manga, if you prefer) series ever, and this is the gem of the series. BUT FOR HEAVENS SAKE GET THE SUBBED AND NOT THE DUBBED!",976752000,,815,4.476510067114094
7915745,5,B00002EQ0U,a director could've made the 3rd episode ballad of fallen angels a john  woo movie.  the mystery was laid out well and the action was great! one of  the most exciting cowboy bebop episodes i've seen so far!,965952000,,206,4.368421052631579
7915746,5,B00002EQ0U,"This volume contain the episode Ballads of The Fallen Angels which is da best episode so far. The visual is breathtaking and there are plenty of Hong-Kong-style gunfight, the closest I can think off right now is the  church battle in the end of the John Woo's movie Face/Off. That said, this  episode contains slightly more violence and blood than the usual Cowboy  Bebop fare so you have been warned. If you have been following the series,  you would have watched it by now, if you have not, its not too late, only 4  volume has been released thus far, you can still catch up.",945129600,2,577,4.457142857142857
