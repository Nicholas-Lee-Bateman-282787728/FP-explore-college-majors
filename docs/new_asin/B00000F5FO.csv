7907192,1,B00000F5FO,"Although I did not purchase this movie, I watched it on cable. While it was kind of 'cute', I agree with another reviewer that found the monkey to be obnoxious. It goes without saying that I enjoyed the Nazis being killed. But what would have made my joy even more is if the primate got scrubbed in the cross-fire be it by friendly fire or by the Nazis.",1324425600,,353,4.205882352941177
7907193,2,B00000F5FO,"This film is an unintentional scream.  It's HORRIBLE.  Yes, HORRIBLE.  The over-acting is extreme,  there's plenty of bad acting to go around,  the production values are nothing short of ghastly (save for some occasionally decent camera work), and the plot?  Why, the plot is idiotic.

All that said, you can't help but roaring with side splitting delight as you watch the adventures of Duncan Jax,  spy with a receding hairline extra-ordinaire, played in a doggedly determined manner by Ian Hunter (have you ever heard of him?  I hadn't!) who has, as a sidekick, an obnoxious babboon whose only trick is to do the Italian crude gesture that accompanied by a vulgar phrase inviting someone to have sexual congress with themself!  The babboon does this several times during the course of the film, too, and it gets less amusing every time he does it.

 Duncan's job, not to get overly involved in the plot, is to thwart a cadre of neo-nazis led by a guy who makes the late Victor Buono (of BATMAN/""King Tut"" fame) look svelte.  A centerpiece of the film?  Dax reveals early on that ""Adolf Hitler is ALIVE....cryogenically preserved!""

You have to wonder what group of drunkards got together and came up with this story, and then you have to wonder what group of drunkards thought it would be a good idea to bring this hot and horrible mess to the silver screen?  All that said, it's so incredibly, horribly bad, it's good.  Between the bad acting, the hideous lines, the uninspired and formulaic musical soundtrack,  the failed attempts at humor, the presence of way too many animals (aside from the babboon, you'll see a parrot and a monkey in cameos), and the ""Who ARE these guys?"" acting troupe, it's a gut-bustingly funny pile of pure crapola!  The fine folks at Mystery Science Theater should try to acquire the rights to this beauty--it's just THAT BAD!

My sides are still aching from laughter!

If I were reviewing this film as a serious effort, it would get one star--actually, closer to three quarters of a star (some credit has to be given for the choice of location shots in some instances, as well as the occasionally decent, if a bit affected,  camera work).  As a work of unintentional comedy, I've got to give it  a full five stars, so long as it's viewed with viciously witty friends who won't spare the commentary!  For the purposes of this review, I'll give it two stars...in an effort to try to split the difference.

I still can't believe MGM released this thing--you have to wonder if payment of an underworld gambling debt was involved in that process!",1257292800,3,2574,4.72808988764045
