8227577,5,B000XAAE44,"Ukraine's 2010 election concludes once and for all the era ushered in by the Orange Revolution. Victor Yushchenko has been swept aside receiving a paltry 5.5 percent.  In what can only be surmised as a spiteful last move Yushenko declared the infamous and controversial Stepan Bendera a Hero of Ukraine.
(...)

A political tactic akin to the retreating Roman army's poisoning of wells. Yushenko's former fiery ally, turned bitter enemy, Yulia Tymoshenko conceded defeat. The semi-literate ex-convict Victor Yanukovich, who's fraudulent initial victory in 2004 set of the Orange Revolution, has secured the presidency in what is widely reported as a fair and balanced election. This turn of political fortunes is however more farce than irony. In light of these events Orange Winter seems all the more prophetic, viewing the historic events of 2004 with a cool eye. The film possesses an seemingly preternatural sense for the disparity between the brave actions of a desperate people pushed to the limit of tolerance and the usurper-politicians staging their power plays on this backdrop.

 Orange Winter is no mere documentary, rather a meditation on the fate of a nation with a rich commentary on the theater of politics and power. A film who's sad relevance has only grown with time.  Highly recommended if you are looking beyond just a political reportage.",1270598400,2,1359,5.187214611872146
8227578,1,B000XAAE44,"Viewing only Orange Winter will not lead one to have an in-depth, impartial understanding of what really happened during the Orange Revolution in Ukraine; and, especially so, since the commentary and visuals are flavored throughout with both subtle and obvious biases. For a true picture of the events as they unfolded, see the DVD called Orange Revolution by Film Director Steve York--for it should be added to history curriculums worldwide and is a must-see documentary (please see my review of Orange Revolution for additional comments).

Throughout the documentary, filmmaker (creator, director, editor) Zagdansky's lens and commentary both flavor events, reflecting them in a subjective reporting style.  As an example, a film segment shows a senior holding a poster of Ukrainian bard Taras Shevchenko, while the following subtitle and narration are seen and heard:  ""For the holy fools, the Maidan became the church steps."" That is the type of commentary and political agenda that viewers are treated to in this Zagdansky film--not objective reporting, but loaded personal commentary.

Two Ukrainian presidential candidates, both named Viktor, both with last names beginning with Y, but dioxin/Agent Orange poisoning, which disfigured the face of one almost killing him, and accusations of falsified election results made this election irregular by any standard, and made for riveting international headline news and eager Internet/TV/radio observation by millions globally. As with other DVDs documenting the Orange Revolution, Orange Winter is a documentary which follows the story of the rigged 2004 presidential election in Ukraine which culminated in the Orange Revolution; however, it approaches its subject in a unique way.

A revolution; a history lesson; one silent classic (Ukrainian filmmaker Oleksander Dovzhenko's masterpiece film, Zemlia [Earth], 1930); and, two classic operas at The Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian National Opera House (Russian composer Modest Mussorgsky's opera ""Boris Godunov,"" 1868-9, and Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi's opera ""Traviata,"" 1853;--all of these are part and parcel of the 2006, 72-minute film in English with optional subtitles in Ukrainian, Russian, and English and with available audio in English or Ukrainian. The intercut and juxtaposition of the elements make for an unusual journey depicting the events leading to the Orange Revolution, and culminate in the documentary, Orange Winter. Scenes from the interior of the opera house with performances of two operas and scenes from the silent masterpiece, Zemlia [Earth], are interspersed with scenes from the Orange Revolution throughout this documentary.

In Orange Winter, we're told that Dovzhenko's silent masterpiece film, Zemlia (Earth) was ""conceived by Soviet propaganda; the film came into the world a masterpiece.""  Here's what the Encyclopedia of Ukraine says regarding Dovzhenko and his silent masterpiece film:  ""His last silent movie, Zemlia (The Earth, 1930), dealing with the collectivization drive in Ukraine, is a masterpiece. Dovzhenko was severely criticized as a Ukrainian nationalist for this film and for his next film, Ivan (1932), about the building of the Dnieper (Dnipro) Dam. He was forced to move to Moscow, where he lived as if in exile until his death.""  The ""Soviet propaganda"" phrase by filmmaker Zagdansky shows his agenda--and it comes neither from the book of neutrality nor from the journal of objectivity.

Recipient of: Juror's Choice Selection (1st Prize), 27 Annual Black Maria Film + Video Festival, USA, February, 2008; SF Documentary Festival 2007, Roxie Film Theater, San Francisco, USA, September, 2007; Special Mention Award, Punto De Vista IDFF of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain, February, 2007; and, Official Selection, Contact IDFF Kiev (Kyiv) Ukraine, 2007.  Some of these awards and mentions look questionable; the last one, for example, says Official Selection, but doesn't say of what only says to contact IDFF.  The SF Documentary Festival 2007 doesn't even mention what was received, only that it took place at Roxie Film Theater.

Following a falsified November 21, 2004 presidential election, ""the biggest mass protest in post-Soviet history captivated the world and marked the beginning of the Orange Revolution."" This Andrei Zagdansky film chronicles those events as they unfold in Kyiv, Ukraine; nevertheless, the viewer must be cautious/observant in following the dialogue and subsequent scenes for subliminal and obvious biases.

Orange was the color of the opposition government in Ukraine's 2004 election; orange was the color of Viktor Yushchenko's party; and, orange, or specifically, Agent Orange, was another name for dioxin--the poison that almost killed Ukrainian presidential candidate Yushchenko. The opening shot shows the exterior of The Taras Shevchenko Ukrainian National Opera House.  The title Orange Winter is shown in two colors: callous color white colors the word orange and sherbet orange colors the word winter. The DVD's dust jacket shows a pair of black boots with orange boot laces. The production company is called Two Boots Pioneer Theater. The word Pioneer conjures to my mind Soviet/Russian (as in the retirement home which I saw from the outside during a city tour when I visited Sitka, Alaska, which was called the Sitka Pioneer Home--at the request of Sitka's Russians, Alaska's representative introduced a bill to appropriate funds to establish the Alaska Pioneer Home at Sitka).

Sharp color footage enhances the film, but I found the narration by Matthew Gurewitsch to be too slow for my liking and his voice to be monotonic. Additionally, the misspelling of Yanukovych as Yanukovich throughout the film's subtitles left me disconcerted/distracted. The spelling on the website of the Ukrainian Party of Regions states his name to be spelled as Yanukovych.  Further, since both first names had the name of Viktor misspelled as Victor in the Product Description, I submitted the corrections to Amazon, and they now appear correctly in the Product Description.  In Orange Winter, the Yanukovich spelling appears to be Russian, as are references to the Ukrainian capital (Kiev instead of Kyiv) and Kyiv's main street (Kreshchatyk instead of Khryshchatyk).

When I think of the Orange Revolution, I think of the peaceful revolution of the Ukrainian people; what I see on the dust jacket of the DVD is what appears to be a pair of military boots--again, disconcerting for me since boots conjure military and fighting, but not peace. The Orange Revolution went down in history as one of the most peaceful in a decade; and, military boots do not evoke peaceful images.

Although a novel approach was used in the making of Orange Winter to differentiate it from the various Orange Revolution DVDs on the market, for me, Orange Winter didn't deliver the excitement of that period in Ukraine's history--it's a recitation of facts interwoven with film footage. Since I followed the Orange Revolution in real time as it happened--on the Internet and in the media, I can recall the excitement, the tension, the apprehension--which seldom came across as I watched Orange Winter.  Many times, I wanted to hear the crowds--what I heard was an unexcited, tedious/humdrum voice; what I heard was muted crowd participation, at best.  In another scene, hearing somber classical music while watching footage during a tense confrontation was surreal. I didn't feel that I was partaking in a significant historical moment, but I did feel that I was removed from the scene--part of an audience watching a film.  Albeit Zagdansky's technique of intercutting and juxtaposition is interesting, I felt that, at times, it detracted from the real action on the streets.

The film is a documentary of the times, since it shows: a bottle of water on a desk; a cell phone held to the ear; election results on a large outdoor screen; sign language by an interpreter on TV; holding victory signs; a camcorder recording events; orange-colored hair, headbands; press microphones; tape recorders; exit polls...

However, there were so many events happening that should have been chronicled; interviews with relevant players would have added a much-needed dimension. Over one million citizens took to the streets; many times, the footage didn't convey the magnitude. The colors in the film are nice; however, this was to be a documentary, but what came across was a surreal attempt at interspersing opera scenes and silent movie scenes with the actual scenes on the streets of Kyiv--in the process, the excitement, the electricity were lost.

In addition, the brief trailer left me perplexed/puzzled. In one scene, the narrator says, ""the crowd is gathered in anger,"" while I simultaneously see neutral and/or happy faces appearing on the screen--as one example, a smiling woman is energetically waiving an orange flag--the words don't correlate with the visuals--a dissonance / disconnect / dilemma ensues. In another case, a subtitle with the words ""they stole the election,"" is immediately followed by a scene showing Ukrainians in orange, indicating to the unsuspecting / uninformed / uneducated / perhaps dozing off viewer that it was the orange-wearing supporters who ""stole the election,"" when in fact, it was the blue-wearing (Yanukovych) supporters who ""stole the election.""

Orange Winter is a film to possibly study in a filmmaking class--for juxtaposition or for intercut techniques. However, for documentary viewing of events in an impartial format and as they were experienced, I heartily recommend a different DVD--Orange Revolution.

8227579,5,B000XAAE44,"Documentaries do not often push genre envelope. And for obvious reasons: documentary is first and foremost a document. Zagdansky's Orange Winter transcends the boundaries of a political reportage-chronicle of the fight between two presidential candidates, Victor Yushchenko and Victor Yanukovich, or for that matter between the West and East of Ukraine in 2004.
The director describes the days and hours of the Orange Revolution, intertwining striking shots of hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Kiev with choir scenes in Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov, the infamous tsar-murderer on stage with modern Ukrainian politicians.

Another ""discovery"": excerpts from Alexander Dovzhenko's silent masterpiece Earth elevate captured events into a different space-time continuum, into Eternity.

Orange Winter is an intense emotional essay on People and Power, and it leaves you with a tragic sense of the everlasting conflict between the people and the state.  It is sad and yet uplifting, as real art must be.
