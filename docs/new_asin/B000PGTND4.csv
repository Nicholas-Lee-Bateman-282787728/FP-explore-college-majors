I would have preferred Mel Brooks as the husband and Barbra Streisand as Hedda in a musical comedy version over this. Get the Ingrid Bergman performance or rent both and compare the scene where Hedda burns the novel. Then howl with laughter or pity poor Diana Rigg..maybe it was the director's fault, but really, Diana, did you even read the play or understand Ibsen(?). Out of their depth in every way.  The male actors as well; they act like fops or her brothers rather than passionate lovers. Simply AWFUL!",1261958400,5,575,4.75
8191227,4,B000PGTND4,"Hedda Gabler is one of the most fascinating (and finally enigmatic) characters in the Theatre. As the embodiment of a lifeforce derailed by vulgarity and tediousness, she is a smarter, and therefore more tragic, Madame Bovary. There is a yearning in Hedda for beauty, for a freer life, for living adventurously... and yet she dares not to do so, and can find release only in destruction. It is a pleasure to see Diana Rigg in anything, and more in this iconic role. Her portrayal of Hedda is one of devastating grief and missed opportunities hardening into a despairing existential malevolence. It's a daring way to play it, including some lesbian overtones, reinforced by the fact that she shows no real love for the men around her, but rather she would have liked to live like one. Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of Hedda, also available in DVD, is a must see too for another stunning take on this character.",1197072000,11,906,4.777070063694268

8191229,4,B000PGTND4,"I enjoy Henrik Ibsen as much as the next well-read individual.  Diana Rigg is fantastic as the doomed, melancholy Hedda.  Unfortunately this DVD transfer had very poor sound quality -- my hearing is perfectly fine but I found myself turning up the volume to record levels just to make out the basics of the dialogue.  It was particularly unpleasant when any of the men spoke because their booming voices carried TOO loudly.  Diana Rigg herself (for whatever reason) was almost impossible to hear most of the time.

What exacerbates the issue here is that there was NO CLOSED-CAPTIONING option on the DVD, and in this day and age, I would think every DVD released on the market would have them.",1186531200,22,693,4.741666666666666
