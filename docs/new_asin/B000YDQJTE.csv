8232288,1,B000YDQJTE,"This is another piece of trash written to discredit the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by and for people who will believe anything they are told. Why is it that a little bit of knowledge becomes so dangerous when placed in the hands of people who have no idea what they are talking about? Nothing of value here for people who are seeking to know the truth. Why not spend your time writing about things that you know and understand? Things that will life people up and promote positive ideals in the lives of people who watch it? Instead you only choose to tear down, discredit and ridicule ideas and people that are dedicated to improving themselves and seeking to become more like God. What better example is there? Surely you don't want people setting you up as an example and seeking to become more like you, out to destroy whatever you don't understand or believe in.",1366588800,6,884,4.566037735849057
8232289,1,B000YDQJTE,"More than willing to discuss, consider, or correct what people might think about religions, but this is one of those total mistruth books made about many religions by some organization who doesn't care about writing facts and just letting a person consider it for themselves.",1322092800,,275,5.133333333333334
8232290,1,B000YDQJTE,"One big waist of time. Not only are the filmmaker completely off on almost everything in this ""film"" they are just spreading hate and discrimination about a church that at one time had an extermination order placed on them just because they wanted to worship how they saw fit. Some defended their homes, wives and children so now they have a bloody past? Ridicules. Maybe if the US government and militias didn't kill innocent men, women and children just for their religious freedoms they would not have a ""bloody past."" Is that not the core freedom that this country was created on? These pore Mormons even now are being persecuted for their beliefs I say let them be. How many anti-religious films have the Mormons put out? I have never seen one yet there are hundreds of films ridiculing the LDS people and their faiths. The description of this film is full of falsehoods. Man and Wife become Gods and Goddesses if they live righteously and follow Gods commandments. All parents want for their children what they have, why is that any different from our own heavenly father and mother. Adam and Jesus Christ helped to create this earth under the command and guidance of God. Think of God as a forman, It was Gods project all along. FBI computer analysis reports on writhing show that NO one that was part of the founding of this church wrote any of the Book of Mormon. It was written by many others none of witch are Joseph Smith or his church members. Mr. Smith translated these scriptures and there have been at least thirteen other grown men and one woman who saw the plates that it was translated from. Not all of them stayed with this church but not one ever denied seeing the plates. DNA and scientific evidence have proven that things that are told in the Book of Mormon took place. This is a un bias fact not the lousy resources that were taken from this film. The Bible has been changed from generation to generation, language to language, church to church. Their are many different variants of the Bible in this world, the Mormons believe in the original version before all the changes done to it. The Book of Mormon has never been changed. It came from the source and is the same today as it was one hundred years ago. These filmmakers are just spiteful and to call a church that has Jesus Christ in the title a cult is just insulting. Mormons are some of the most friendly, helping, and kind people I have ever met. 13 million strong and growing everyday. I would not recommend this film to anyone.",1225497600,6,2514,4.551876379690949
8232291,1,B000YDQJTE,"I won't take time here to refute more than one of the preposterous statments made above, but the easiest to refute is that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the Golden Plates from which the Prophet Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon never existed.  That is a complete falsehood.  I have been a member of the LDS Church for 60 years and I have never heard that taught anywhere in the Church and I read all kinds of materials -- both those produced by the Church as well as some anti-LDS material. I have also taught extensively in the Church.  Since this particular lie is so basic to whatever else this particular author thinks he knows about the LDS Church, I would be very skeptical about anything else in his presentation.",1218672000,4,760,4.573529411764706
