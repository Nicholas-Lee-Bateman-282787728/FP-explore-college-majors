2616682,3,B000GRUR64,"I WAITED FOR THE DVD TO BE OUT WITH ANTICIPATION AS I HAD SEEN IT ON TV.  BUT ON THE DVD THEY CONCENTRATED ON THE OTHER STORIES AND LEFT A BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY ON THE CUTTING FLOOR.  TOO BAD AS THE ACTING BY SENDEL IS SO GREAT AND THIS WAS HIS FIRST ROLE AS THE LEADING MAN.

I WOULD RATE IT A HIGH 5 STAR, BUT YOU MISS SO MUCH WITH THE EDITING.",1161561600,5,345,3.6986301369863015
2616683,5,B000GRUR64,"And this is a tough one to accomplish as ""La Madrastra"" was really good. What makes this one so different? THE CHARACTERS!

Wow, they struck gold on this Ernesto Alonso production. Given the standard storyline (poor girl overcomes troubles, gains power and respect and gets her revenge to find true love), it is important to have other aspects of a telenovela that stand out to make people watch them. I believe that this telenovela has been the most colourful and entertaining of the bunch. The talents of MArgarita ISabel, Sylvia PAsquel, Alejandro Ibarra and the amazingly talented Tiare Scanda make this novela what it is. None of these people are the star yet managed to steal the star from Yadhira Carrillo and Sergio Sendel.

The story is about Nora, a humble girl who lives tormented by her father, who desperately wants her to marry for money to take care of herself and their stepmother. Even after his death, he continues to haunt her and his evils are carried on subtely by her ""madrastra"" (Sylvia PAsquel). She then realizes that everyone is only out to use her, even her own boyfriend..and tries to run away from it all only to land in the arms of a new lover (Sergio Sendel). She then has to overcome circumstances that happen that taint what would be their love and becomes cold and rigid..for that is the way she must be to live.

Sounds typical right? But then there's subplots..involving Nora's rich aunt and her ugly niece Casilda..and the hilarious background evil doings of Isaura (PAsquel). All these things add up and are hours of pure entertainment and never a dull moment.

BUY THIS DVD or rent it as soon as it becomes available to you. It'll have you wanting more. Tiare Scanda alone makes this novela a riot..clearly she is a great talent that has yet to truly shine in the entertainment business.",1154736000,11,1826,4.714733542319749
2616704,5,B000GRUR64,Exelent and very good item. Exelent transaction,1406678400,,47,5.857142857142857
2616705,3,B000GRUR64,This story goes a lot of places you don't expect it to. And that's not really a good thing. It ends up feeling so contrived that it sucks all the enjoyment out of it.,1404777600,,166,3.911764705882353
2616706,1,B000GRUR64,I saw this novela for the first time when it came out way back in the day. It has always been my favorite story. My sister bought me this DVD for my birthday I was so exited to watch it. I got cozy in my bed and the first thing I noticed was that in the main menu it didn't even have the theme song of the novela. I didn't mind but was a little taken back I should have known that this was just the start of my disappointment. The story is really bad edited. It will make no sense at all if it's your first time watching it. And if you already saw it it's just a BIG dissapointment! Save your money people and shame on you Televisa!!!,1353456000,,634,3.8846153846153846
2616707,5,B000GRUR64,"This is my favorite telenovela of all times! Alguien Te Mira is also really good with Dana Garcia and also La Reina del Sur.. All amazing actors.. I only wish there was no editing on this particular telenovela... This was too good  of a story to be in just 3dvds,,",1320883200,,264,4.28
2616708,4,B000GRUR64,"Esta novela es regular pero la historia es interesante ,,este actor generalmente hace papeles de malo y en esta el es es protagonico ,,la actuacion es buena de los actores ,,y la historia me parecio diferente ..la recomiendo",1315008000,,224,4.921052631578948
2616709,3,B000GRUR64,"I saw the original version on t.v., so compared to that it is pretty true to the story line; however, extremely condensed and at times hard-to-follow if you don't already know what is supposed to happen.",1312502400,,203,4.666666666666667
2616710,2,B000GRUR64,I loved this telenovela when it was broadcast on TV and finally looked it up recently and bought it.  I have been so disappointed with how much was cut out of the DVDs.  There were several times that I stopped the DVD player to check if I accidently skipped over any sections because events would be mentioned that were never shown.  Sometimes it really didn't make sense.  Wish I could buy the whole thing.,1294272000,,407,4.45945945945946
2616711,4,B000GRUR64,"This story is by far my favorite I have seen yet.  The editing however...what a shame, they cut out way too many parts.  I think most of us purchased this with the intention on watching the full story.  I was saddened to realize I would see more on youtube of the parts missed then on this purchase.  Nevertheless, Yadhira Carillo became my favorite actress after watching this telenovela and I look forward to seeing her in other productions.  Her acting is sure to not dissapoint.

And so, I loved this story so much to not give it a 1 star, but couldn't give a 5 based on all the editing.",1254441600,5,591,4.327272727272727
2616712,3,B000GRUR64,"I think the novel was overall Good.  I do agree with other reviews there were crucial parts that needed to be included.  However, it kept me very interested on the scenes.  I wished that the part were Mr Palacios daughter was hurt by the boyfriend were included I think it was important.",1251676800,,287,4.480769230769231
2616713,1,B000GRUR64,"This DVD had so many crucial parts cut out that I feel it was poorly edited and extremely cut DVD, which made this a waste of my money.

I know parts were cut because it is a Novela that up until recently I was watching on my lunch hour, until they moved time slots. I was not able to watch it until I recently got a DVR.

Natrully I watched the DVD I purchased from the beginning and realized all the cuts in what I consider important parts of the stroy line.

Isn't there a full version?

Also one of the DVD's was sliding around in the case when I got it in the mail because it was not secure and was scratched very badly but was still viewable.

I am very dissapointed in this DVD and found it a poor buy.

Thank you,
