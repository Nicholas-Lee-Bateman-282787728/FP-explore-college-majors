8486758,4,B00000IPH6,"This is a very good introduction to the firearms commonly used in competition in the Single Action Shooting Society. It also delves in to the history of firearms development as it applies to the settling of the West. Although there were a few minor technical errors in describing a given firearm, overall the content was accurate. With commentary and demonstration by noted gunwiter and SASS member Mike Venturino, as well as two other active SASS members, it presents a very credible primer on the subject. Too bad it's not available on DVD anymore. Look for the VHS version.",982368000,,576,4.887755102040816
