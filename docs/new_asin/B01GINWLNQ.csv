8762958,5,B01GINWLNQ,These workouts are so fun! And you can mix and match 5 different 10-min segments to choose the length of your workout. I never thought I would sweat so much with 2# weights! These remind me of dream body workouts but without ever feeling frantic. Well done Linda!,1524873600,,263,4.5
8762959,5,B01GINWLNQ,"Love this workout! Its fun cardio and works up a great sweat. I also love the different styles in each ten minute segment. Theres ballet box, kettlebell, standing barre arms, cardio interval tone and total body mat. Each is equally challenging yet fun with zero dead factor.",1524787200,,274,4.851063829787234
