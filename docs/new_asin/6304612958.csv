7878661,5,6304612958,Absolutely LOVE this film (especially the music).  Had it on VHS and have been searching for the DVD version.  Love it!,1369440000,,119,4.619047619047619
7878662,3,6304612958,Good job by the veteran actors but the new actor fell short of believability. )If that is a word.)  Give the guy a gal we can believe he would fall for--there are plenty of Jamaican cuties to choose from--can probably act at least as well.,1358121600,,239,4.311111111111111
7878663,1,6304612958,"I selected this film because it was to star Vanessa Redgrave and John Hurt....two amazing actors.  I can only wonder what Vanessa was thinking when she accepted this part....Did she need the money?  Was she being blackmailed for something?  Then  I kept waiting for handsome, charming, always magical John Hurt and he never appeared.  I saw in the credits that the evil professor was played by John Hurt and again I have to wonder what happened to him?  Was it an incredible make up job or did Hurt suffer some terrible disease that aged him hideously?

Actually Redgrave is only a minor player in this film.  The main action takes place between a middle aged white man, apparently a Scot, all done up in a kilt and carrying a bagpipe and a young black girl who wears white sox with her black sandals.  I found their romance to be utterly unbelievable.  The film is so loaded with apparently meaningful pronouncements about life and flying and believing in your dreams, etc. that it makes you want to throw all the characters overboard.  Why I continued to watch it to the end, I don't know.  Save yourself the trip.",1342310400,,1116,4.6091370558375635
7878664,5,6304612958,"The film co-stars Vanessa Redgrave and John Hurt, they are the side characters in this film.  That has to say a lot, doesn't it?

The film stars Dorothy Tutin and Jonathan Pryce as the central romantic couple.  The story of their romance is rich with insights about love.

I know that the film co-features socially controversial romance, deception and loss.  But what the film centrally features is romantic love.  The deception and loss are vital to serve as the counterpoint to finding love.  The social controversies of age and race become superficial concerns in the blinding glare of being faced with love.

I recommend this film.  Its a lovely quiet simmering film that you'll come to appreciate slowly.",1288137600,,709,4.940677966101695
7878665,1,6304612958,"Truly disappointing film. A good starting linestory, wasting good actors; I saw it on TV and the DVD has a different ending missing scenes while adding others that are irrelevant. A waste of time and money.",1157328000,3,206,4.75
7878666,1,6304612958,"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was colorful.  The island scenes, the flamboyant shipboard sets...etc.  However, the story is too stupid to be believed.  I believe there is supposed to be some kind of mystery tucked in and amongst all the vapid and shallow subplots but you will find your mind wandering so often you will not be able to figure out what the mystery is.

Then there is some kind of philosophizing which goes on when the main character Gabriel Angel (I guess that name is supposed to have some kind of significance too but who knows what?) makes her speeches about what life is about but, again, it's almost impossible to figure out what the point of these speeches is either.

Don't waste your time.",1141776000,4,740,4.492537313432836
7878667,4,6304612958,"I found this movie to be very uplifting. It isn't just about a girl learning to fly or about her romance on ship board, although those things are elements of the film. It is a message to everyone that in order to live  and move forward in life one must let go of the past. One needs to let go  of one's fears, and one needs to love regardless of social convention,  race, orientation, etc. While the plot did have a lot of angles, it was  tied up nicely by the end, and I felt overall it was a film worth watching.",951609600,11,514,4.009803921568627
