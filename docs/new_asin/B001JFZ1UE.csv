3657828,4,B001JFZ1UE,"Friday the 13th Part 9 Jason Goes to Hell

It was an okay movie, sadly Jason was only in the beginning and end of the movie. My favorite part of the movie was when Jason was shot and blown up by a SWAT team.

Jason X

The whole idea of it being in space is very stupid, the only good side about it being in the future though was that Jason has new ways to kill people instead of just stabbing them. Overall I enjoyed it.

Freddy Vs Jason

It is mainly about Freddy but Jason is in a lot of the movie too. This is the movie that has the highest kill count in any friday the 13th movie, with a total of 30 kills.

Overall it is worth it to buy even if it doesn't have movies that are amazing and good, it is still worth buying if your a friday the 13th fan. One thing I like that they did was you could skip to a certain kill in each of the movie menus.",1466294400,3,851,3.7796610169491527

I was disappointed in their first effort, Jason Goes to Hell, when I first saw it at the cinema, which I felt petered out after a strong start, but I am hoping I will find more to like about it when I revisit it on dvd.  Jason X,  I first saw on satellite years ago, and was pleasantly surprised at how entertaining it was.  Having a cool outer space setting, above average special effects, an interesting storyline, along the exotically beautiful Lexa Doig in the cast  solidified this as a worthy addition to the series.  The last film in this set, Freddy Vs Jason, I have never seen, and am looking forward to watching it.  All in all, a good deal for the money.",1419465600,,801,4.230263157894737

The set comes with the following 3 films : Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X, and Freddy vs Jason.

Jason Goes To Hell is one of the more polarizing films of the series. It has it's fans, but just as many think it's the worst of the series. I've always really liked it, but part of that may be nostalgia since I grew up watching it along with the first 8.
Jason himself is only in the film briefly at the very start and at the very end, and the rest of the film is him body jumping with his goal being to be reborn.
The film is extremely different than any of the others, and the plot IS over the top. However the film does have top notch gore effects, a rather suspenseful opening sequence, a few very cool action set pieces, two very solid and likeable leads, a memorable sex scene involving a couple of attractive campers, and plenty of little nods to other classic horror films. Look out for sets of various classic horror films! True horror fans will likely spot them very easily :). So even if the film has its fair share of flaws; it still has plenty to like for fans of the series.
The dvd comes with a commentary, the R and Unrated version (though who's going to actually watch the R rated version?), some deleted scenes (most of them air as filler for padding when this airs on tv since various scenes have to be cut due to content. Survivor fans can look out for Jonathan Penner in one deleted scene :) ), and finally the film comes with the theatrical trailer.

Jason X is next, and it's entertaining as long as you keep your expectations low.
The film honestly looks like it could've been made for the Scy fy channel, and places Jason in space. Think Alien, but only with Jason.
The film's effects look pretty poor, and won't age well as it gets older, but the film isn't boring and is more like the original 8 atmosphere wise than Jason Goes to Hell is. Just don't take it too serious.
The film comes with a commentary from the director, writer, and producer, a few documentary's, a making of, and its trailer.

Freddy vs Jason is the final film of the set, and the one I personally like the least. However that is of course just my opinion, and most people seem to like this one more than the previous two.
This one pits the two horror icons against each other after Freddy summons Jason back from the dead to do his bidding on Elm Street. Things don't go well, and the film has the two dueling it out during the films climax.
Honestly I've always thought this one was a letdown, and it suffers from cartoonish directing from Ronny Yu, and terrible performances from everyone in the cast excluding Robert Englund (who's always great as Freddy). It would've been nice to see Kane Hodder reprise his role as Jason too. Instead they go for a guy who lacks all the personality Hodder infused into his role.
I'm sure it wasn't easy to write both characters into the film, but I honestly think it still had more potential than what we got as a final product.
The film comes with two discs and plenty of extras. A commentary with the director, Enguland, and Kirzinger (the actor who plays Jason), deleted and alternate scenes with filmmaker commentary, a behind the scenes of the films development, a visual effects exploration, storyboards and galleries, its theatrical trailer and some tv spots, and a music video.

All 3 films each come in a slim case.

Overrall this set is most definitly worth picking up for fans who wants a nice cheap way to own the New Line films. Each film has its flaws, but they're still alot of fun to watch.",1388016000,2,3722,4.379160636758321

You get three films for a very nice price. In it is Jason goes to hell with some cool bonus features including the alternate ending. Jason x, and Freddy versus Jason. Both of which are the premium releases. FvJ is the two disc as with Jason X.
 I would say get this set and if your looking for a decent set.",1380585600,,451,3.849462365591398
3657858,3,B001JFZ1UE,"You get three F13 films in this 3-disc DVD value pack (Jason Goes to Hell, Jason X and Freddy vs. Jason). This pack is priced right since two of these films are not available on Blu-ray (other than F13: Complete Collection BD). There are collections available with all the films available on DVD and Blu-ray. These three films are likely the weakest of the franchise but collectors like them to complete their set. Jason Goes to Hell is the worst of the lot. Jason isn't really in it nor are there many teenagers or other traditional F13 elements. Jason X isn't as bad as it sounds but is far from good. The special effects and wardrobe are lame but it can be fun. Freddy vs. Jason is more of a Freddy film because Jason is now afraid of the water (which contradicts just about every other F13 film). There is some bonus content available on each disc.

[Jason Goes to Hell] JGTH is the weakest of the entire franchise. I love most of the F13 films but this one was directed by a guy who got removed during the final editing (seemingly for the better). It had plenty of pent-up problems that overflowed when the young director turned a bloated, poorly shot and badly acted film to Sean Cunningham who freaked when he saw this. Cunningham: ""I had to turn this 'thing' into a movie because it was nearly un-releasable."" The best parts are pick-ups producer Cunningham shot weeks after production had wrapped. Those were mostly additional violence and nudity (the beginning SWAT team shooting and some nudity inserted part-way through). This F13 features the worst cast of the series and the most complicated plot. There isn't really much in the way of hot teenagers, Crystal Lake or Jason. JGTH doesn't feature Jason in a mask much at all because Jason body hops and turns into a slug. Other characters play a possessed ""Jason"". Sorry that's not going to work. Jason does show up at the end to absorb some boxing punches (which didn't work in Jason Takes Manhattan but somehow slows Jason down here). Logic errors, plot holes and bad acting make Manhattan look sensible next to this.

The worst part is after this strange turn of events about Jason's relatives we find none of the ""clues"" in the film have any real meaning. Most of the cast members have said, ""Don't ask me what it's about. I still don't know,"" in interviews for the film and the His Name Was Jason documentary. Jason's relative is the equivalent of Freddy's previously unmentioned daughter in Freddy's Dead. Director Adam Marcus said, ""The fans hate seeing Jason in Camp Crystal Lake"". Cunningham said, ""The only thing fans want is Jason in Camp Crystal Lake."" It was madness from the beginning. Not many people associated with this production ever worked again (leading man, leading lady, director). However, Erin Grey and the bounty hunter were great. The tease at the end is cool but pointless because Freddy vs. Jason went into development hell for a decade before finally being released (it was OK but not really worth the wait). I'm not sure anyone has figured out what the title and box cover art has to do with this film (or the franchise) at all. Most insultingly, director Adam Marcus was quoted as saying, ""Don't hamper the filmmaking community by asking for the same movie to be made over and over. Take a look at yourselves."" Yet Marcus claims to be a (self-appointed) horror movie expert.",1378080000,,3368,4.6875

Freddy vs. Jason was an ""okay"" attempt (I do actually own it); but if it's going to be as recent as it is, you would think it would be a LITTLE less cheesy.  The rest of the movies in the series fit the time period, the late 70's and the 80's...because, let's face it.  The late 70's brought disco, and most of the 1980's era WAS cheesy (keep in mind that I grew up in the 80's).  Although I do own a copy of Freddy vs. Jason (only because it came as part of a combination pack of ALL of the Nightmare of Elm St. movies);  although I do own it, Freddy vs. Jason was pretty cheesy and I didn't think it was really all that scary.  The fight scenes between Freddy and Jason bordered on humorous; although I did like the fact that they figured out each other's weakness and used it, that was an interesting spin on things.  And, Jason X??? What were the creators of the movie series thinking? Jason in SPACE?  The only thing worse than this concept was when John Carpenter decided to try and change up the story line of the Halloween movie series with ""Halloween 3""; and then, he went back to Michael Myers in ""Halloween 4"".  ""Jason Goes To Hell"" was an ""okay"" attempt, but I certainly would not choose these three to be in a ""favorites"" package.",1357689600,,1378,4.269230769230769

3657868,5,B001JFZ1UE,"when I first ordered this set I was a bit skeptical about the first two movies, Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X I had heard they were stupid and pointless. I already knew Freddy Vs. Jason was GREAT having seen it before. I am a big fanboy of both(particulary freddy) and found it fun, gory, fast paced, and entertaining. When I watched JGTH I loved it, it had a unique twist, Jason can hop bodies. I loved the gore and the special effects. Not to mention the sex scene. Man that chick had some nice tits. It also had the best kill. When you finally see Jason at the end it is a real treat. Kane Hodder did excellent yet again. When I saw Jason X, It too, was better than i thought. Definitly a great movie. I do believe it is the worst of the three but i still love it. I thought the Mpaa could have let more gore go by. It seemed heavily edited. But the liquid nitrogen kill was awesome.
SPECIAL FEATURES: JGTH has both the unrated and theatrical versions. definitley watch unrated, gore is awesome. Jason X has two documetaries, one about the making of Jason X which is interesting and filled with facts. The other one is titled "" the many masks of jason voorhees. This is my favourite, it is about all the movies and how jason has changed from movie to movie, really interesting. Freddy Vs. Jason has two discs, the second one is loaded with special features, too much to describe. The first disc has a jump to a death feature. Really good fore gorehounds who want to jump straight into the action.",1314144000,3,1500,4.303886925795053
3657869,4,B001JFZ1UE,"Jason Slasher Collection is the rest of the Friday the 13th series that is not included in the Crystal Lake to Mahattan. If you don't own these dvds separately then I recommend picking up this set. All three dvds were packed with some very good extras.

Jason Goes To Hell: Jason's soul is transfered from body to body. I like the story and the unrated version is better. I'd love to see how the series would have turned out if censors didn't cut out all the gore. Jason's make up is the best out of the entire series. Too bad he is seen in maybe only 20-25 minutes of the film. Worth checking out.

Jason X: Jason enters the new decade in a decent little film. The story is typical and has been with other horror series (Leperchaun and Hellraiser). Something just feels off with this movie. I prefer Jason in the woods rather then space. Kane Hodder's last film as Jason. The dvd has some very good speical features including a 30 minute retrospect over the history of Jason and the Friday the 13th franchise.

Jason VS Freddy: What could have been one of the greatest horror films of all-time turns into a decent effort. Many fans, including me, were upset that Kane Hodder would not reprise his role as Jason. Freddy is over the top as usual and the cast is a typical cast that is no different from horror movies from 2000 on. Not bad.

Overall, get this set if you don't own the dvds by themselves.
