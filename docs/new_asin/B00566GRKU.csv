This is a very informative video. It also teaches about many of the lesser known foreign terrorist groups.",1432512000,,269,5.0

8459254,5,B00566GRKU,"In each half hour episode, a terrorist organization is profiled.  Excellent documentary examines the history and developments within organizations that range from the Japanese Sarin Cult and the Chechen Extremists to the Taliban and al-Qaeda.  Historically, the accounts go back only as far as the Kenyan Mau Mau and Nasser and Egytptian Terrorism, so modern terrorist movements are the focus and, regrettably, there are enough to fill out the series.  Good use of news film, a minimum of reenactement material, with a clear summarizing of often-grim events that make the tense musical score superfluous.  Topics:  Early Israeli Terrorism...Al-Qaeda...IRA...Fatah/Hamas...PLO...ETA...Red Brigades...Baader-Meinhoff Gang...EOKA...Nasser and Egyptian Terrorism...Col. Gadaffi and Libyan Terrorism...OAS...Patty Hearst an SLA...Weathermen...Oklahoma Bomnber...KKK...Japanese Sarin Cult...Mahdi Army...Che.,..Castro...Chechen Extremists...Taliban...Mau Mau...Tamil Tigers...Moluccan Separatists..and Somali Warlords.",1392595200,,1012,7.4
8459255,5,B00566GRKU,This is a really comprehensive and brilliant series about terrorism world wide.  A must view for anyone interested in the subject.,1363996800,2,130,5.190476190476191
8459256,3,B00566GRKU,"There is, to my knowledge, no other series of this length and scope on one of the central phenomena of the post-1945 world. This is a sound primer not only on modern terrorism  - or struggles for freedom, as you please - but in the history of postwar political self-expression generally, be it nationalist, ideological, or informed by the struggle for basic civil rights. Even the compulsory Nugus background-foreground muzak cannot detract from Robert Powell's authoritative, if at times slightly hammy, commentary. Be warned - there is a distinct centre-right narrative here. Castro and Guevara get an absolute hammering. Israeli early terrorism is qualified by references to the outrage it caused in the Jewish community at large. Might well be accurate and appropriate, just don't expect this to be neutral.
It is therefore disappointing that the discs are in RAM format and stacked one on top of the other on one spool in the disc jacket. Can't play these on my laptop  - unlike any other Region 1 discs I have ever bought; in addition, I risk scratching them every time I put them back in their case. So don't buy if you'll be watching these primarily on (i) a laptop that (ii) can't read RAM discs. Isn't that most of the mainstream ones?",1361318400,3,1245,4.813084112149533
8459257,5,B00566GRKU,"I have never seen anything that gave such an in depth view of the minds of terrorists. It makes me understand the motives and dangers of terrorists, and helps me appreciate those that fight them. Since 9/11, I had hoped that some day I could do something to help fight these maniacs. If I ever get a career that will help me carry out this dream, I will sure find what I learned from this series useful.",1333497600,,403,4.246753246753247
8459258,4,B00566GRKU,"Very rarely do you find something in a bargain rack at Wal Mart that is informative, but in Houston, I struck gold.

This DVD- International Terrorism:  The Global War on Terror, is a well above average history of Terrorism in the US and abroad.  Al Qaeda is there, The Taliban, Al Fatah, Hamas, The Chechens, Weathermen, Aum Shinryko, separatists, cultists, etc. are chronicled.  These groups were all dangerous, and some that remain, still are.  9/11 is at the forefront and a basis of comparison for many of the still active groups, and the rest are all given objective treatment.

There are drawbacks, as the material on Qadaffi still says he is in power.  So this is somewhat dated material.  The video was made in 2008 or so.  Despite that, this BBC aired series is of interest.  They show Israel having some roots in terrorism, but make the distinction that most Jews were not terrorists, like the Irgun/Stern Gangs, as they showed some Muslims opposed the Taliban and Islamic Brotherhood in Egypt, to their detriment.

I recommend this for any historians and those who are current affairs die-hards.",1316995200,8,1107,4.866310160427807
