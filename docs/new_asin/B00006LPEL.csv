7971861,3,B00006LPEL,I actually bought this for research purposes....not for the non-Russian speaking public.,1406332800,,88,6.416666666666667
7971862,4,B00006LPEL,"If Gabrielle Garcia Marquez drank vodka with Salvadore Dali, fished, and made a movie about it ... this would be the movie.  Very funny and surreal.",1368576000,,148,4.6923076923076925
7971863,4,B00006LPEL,"I have a lot of Russian films. Quite a few comedies too, but there are not a lot of good or interesting Russian comedies of recent vintage. This one, however, is quite fun. There is always something lost in subtitles, especially true with comedies, but enough of it comes through that most folks with a sense of humor and a sensibility for Russian culture will love the tongue in cheek subtle humor. I especially love the character of the General whose philosophical observations on life are priceless. A very centered man, as an absurd world orbits around him. Light hearted and fun, this movie is worth checking out.",1357084800,,618,4.731481481481482
7971864,4,B00006LPEL,"This is a story of a group of men who decide to take a fishing (and drinking) vacation.  Setting off by sea to a cabin, they get directions from a drunk companion and mistakenly find themselves at a cabin in Finland.  But of course, since they are drunk, it takes them a while to notice it.  A series of misadventures follows from there.

This movie avoids becoming stupid or crude.  While alcoholism and Russian vodka play prominently, the characters and their adventures retain a funny, lighthearted air.

It's a cute film that both highlights and makes fun of some elements of the Russian national character.",1091664000,4,611,4.771428571428571
7971865,5,B00006LPEL,"This is a very good, light comedy. It focuses on things that key into Russian life, but the humor is universal. I think most Americans will enjoy it, even if they have to use subtitles to make sense of the very good Russian dialog (I reccomend this as opposed to using the English dubbed track). If fishing, vodka, and just general machismo appeal to  you, get this movie.",1040601600,10,372,4.470588235294118
