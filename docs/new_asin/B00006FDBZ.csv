7967599,3,B00006FDBZ,I found this in a Resale Store for $3. The quality is not the great and looks no different than a bootleg like someone mentioned. The videos look weird like they took a camera and recorded a VHS with a camera and ported the videos onto a DVD. Not worth the money if anyone is looking to collect memorabilia of Aaliyah.,1464912000,,318,4.229508196721311
7967600,4,B00006FDBZ,I enjoy the dvd but i was missing one more video  from this collection that's why i rated it 4 stars  but other than that it was good,1436313600,,133,3.7142857142857144
7967601,3,B00006FDBZ,"Not the greatest quality, but if you want to get a few videos you may have not have been lucky to get of her, I would buy it.  I was disappointed because I wanted Summer Bunnies, it is not on there.  The box is misleading, and the people who rated this item did not rate it honest.  Summer Bunnies is not on this DVD.  Very disappointing.  I had all of her videos.  Thank God, it was only $8.",1174348800,2,392,3.9615384615384617
7967602,2,B00006FDBZ,"This set is way to good to be true.  I bought this collection and two others thinking, jokingly, that they were bootlegs.  But they were advertised in the paper of a major store (which shall go nameless) and I figured I was just being paranoid.  But then on closer inspection, I actually sampled some of the videos.

In the case of the Aaliyah set, you think maybe it's a really good collection, it just happens to be on a no-name company (and, in fact, there is literally no company name on the DVD).  It includes nearly all her hits.  The only ones missing are ""Resoultion"", ""Hot Like Fire"" (which are both sorely missed) and her shockingly bland interpertation of ""Got To Give It Up"" (with a worse video).  But what's included is impressive.  So I watched ""More Than A Woman"" and it looked very good.  Then I tried ""Are You That Somebody"", argueably her most memorable and biggest hit.  The video was darker than the original but it was still good until about half way through where it cuts off to a blue screen that say ""Goodbye Aaliyah""....this is not acceptable!  For this reason alone, this video should be left on the shelf.  I have not looked at further videos but I wouldn't be surprised if they also cut off too soon.

That being said, the addition of lost videos like ""Journey Through the Past"" might be worth it, even if the video is low quality. Someone mentioned this DVD as if it were only targeted at Aaliyah....not true!  The ""The Best Music Videos On DVD"" collections are out on various artists, including the much alive Eminem and Janet.  The only thing is, I would say that unargably, Aaliyah's looks the most complete (but looks are ver decieving).  I'm not sure at all how these work but they look very questionable legally.  Even if they are sold at major stores and through here, buyer beware.",1120521600,10,1818,4.544615384615384
7967603,4,B00006FDBZ,"I got this DVD when it was first released and when i saw the back i was quite excited that finally someone has released most of Aaliyah's videos on DVD. Although i was anxious to see what ""Plus More"" was...there was no more and it is just the 14 videos that are listed in the back, it was still more than i ever expected. I do wish one day they will release a legal DVD with ALL of her videos, including videos she appeared in, but this is more than anyone can ask for. I was lucky to get one that works pretty great, i did hear some people who bought this dvd, it didn't even work for them. It contains full videos from start to finish, and even one video which i never saw before until this dvd came out, and I'm glad it did. If one day a legal one comes out I will buy it. Aside from the mispelling on the back of the dvd, and false advertising making you think that there's more on the dvd, I am glad i bought it.
Videos on DVD:
Rock the boat
Are you that somebody?
Back in one piece
Try again
One in a million
If your girl only knew
Four page letter
Back and Forth
Age ain't nothing but a number
At your best
The one i gave my heart to
Journey to the past
Summer Bunnies
I need you tonight",1086912000,6,1194,3.9176954732510287
7967604,3,B00006FDBZ,"I love this dvd only because it does have some of Aaliyah's music videos on it. BUT... it is pretty poor quality! You pay full price for this dvd that comes factory sealed.. but I tell you... U couldn't tell the difference between this and a cheap bootleg off the streets!! The music videos are not edited well.. there is some cut off at the begining and the end of the videos and like I said.. the quality is pretty poor. BUT... if you are a huge Aaliyah fan... this is still one that you would want for your collection just for sentimental reasons. But Im warning you... just because this is a dvd factory sealed, that doesn't mean anything... don't expect too much!! You WILL be disappointed.",1035763200,29,695,4.4375
7967605,4,B00006FDBZ,"This DVD contains about 14 of Aaliyah's videos: Rock the Boat, Are You That Somebody?, Back in One Piece, Try Again, One in a Million, If your Girl Only Knew, Four Page Letter, Back and Forth, Age Ain't Nothing But a Number, At Your Best The One I Gave My Heart To, Journey to the Past, and Summer Bunnies. On the back cover it also adds ""+ More!"", but there is no more - that is it. But that isn't really a big deal.
I was quite surprised that ""More Than a Woman"" + ""We Need a Resolution"" were absent from this collection. Clearly this DVD was not an 'official release', so perhaps that shouldn't be surprising. On the main menu page, there is an option to select songs individually by clicking on the 'Chapters' option, but there is only one page with 4 large moving thumbnails for the first 4 songs. When you click on the next page for the next four songs, there are 4 more smaller moving thumbnails with the words' 8 more videos inside' above them. In other words, the chapter/song selection option only allows you to select 8 of the 14 videos in this way.  It's obvious that the authoring of this DVD was not done professionally.
As for the quality of the videos, most of them are OK, and it's apparent that they were not specially prepared for the DVD format. ""Rock the Boat"" is too bright and washed out, so that a lot of the richness of the Caribbean scenery is lost. The quality of the disc in general is sub-standard, and is more reminiscent of VHS rather than DVD. However, it is still watchable, and is the only Aaliyah DVD collection available at present. Considering the circumstances, it is understandable why her record company and family are not in a rush to release an official video collection. Despite everything, I am still grateful that this DVD is available, and it helps to show Aaliyah's unique and  diverse talent.",1035590400,20,1840,4.473214285714286
7967606,1,B00006FDBZ,This DVD listed is not legal.  It is made by a company putting MEPG files on a dvd. It was listed on EBay and all auctions with people bidding or who had won were cancelled.,1035331200,23,173,3.942857142857143
