7466051,5,B016AENK4M,This was an interesting documentary on the Kunhardt family and their life with collecting Lincoln memorabilia and photos.  Interwoven between the life of Lincoln and is the story of a family trying to make it through life during the difficult depression.  The story mostly revolves around Dorothy Kunhardt and her calling to continue collecting and documenting a collection her father started of every photo of Lincoln.  She came to be better known as the author of Pat the Bunny which is still a popular children's book today.  She is the portrait of a strong woman who battled depression in a time when you were supposed to put a smile on and cover your darkness.  I found the story as well as the memorabilia fascinating and touching.,1464307200,3,737,4.817460317460317
7466052,5,B016AENK4M,"So grateful to this family for having the insight and passion to collect all things Lincoln, and then for sharing it with everyone so history can be known and remembered.  What a fascinating story",1458432000,,196,4.764705882352941
7466053,5,B016AENK4M,"This film is about more than just Lincoln photographs! It's about love, relationships, family dysfunction, sickness and obsession. It's a multi-layered look into a family that passed down an obsession and a sickness from generation to generation. It's my favorite film of 2015! Highly highly recommend!!!",1457395200,,304,5.630434782608695
7466054,5,B016AENK4M,"Excellent documentary about the pursuit of an obsession. Anyone interested in Lincoln should find something new. The running time is stated as approximately 108 minutes, but that is incorrect. Actually, it is about 68 minutes or 1 hour 8 minutes.",1445212800,3,246,5.175
7466055,5,B016AENK4M,"A very moving,  more than slightly ethereal documentary about a family, virtually possessed with a fascination for, and nearly literally by the Spirit of Abraham Lincoln. Touching, melancholy and truthful, the no-nonsense grit of history and lineage pervade a film for all ages. Everyone should witness this work, a happysad story. Better than a thousand lectures about Lincoln. This family has lived him!",1484956800,,405,5.428571428571429

8736065,4,B016AENK4M,"I found this very informative and engrossing.  I have to admit that Lincoln holds no interest for me but after watching this I have a new found attitude regarding his history.  It was confusing though as it seemed to be more about the granddaughter than about the family.  She was a very interesting person and feel that her life would have been more fitting as the whole subject of the film, (which it turned into) then about the collection itself.  Stunning photos and details from the collection, would have loved to read the book she had planned for lincolns sons point of view.",1529280000,,582,4.621359223300971
8736066,5,B016AENK4M,"I saw this on HBO and found it very moving. Essentially, it is about the human condition and how love and loss resonates through the generations. Well worth the time it takes to view it (just a little over an hour). Lincoln is shown as a real human being struggling on his path--as do we all. It's compelling.",1528502400,,309,4.344827586206897
8736067,5,B016AENK4M,"It's hard to describe this. If the Lincoln aspect was missing it would be a tribute to a woman whose accomplishments are enough to warrant attention and admiration.  There's a melancholy tone that arises from the unfulfilled projects that both father and daughter began. I wanted to say to her, ""But look at what you HAVE done.""
 One of the great 'what ifs' of history is how things would have played out had Lincoln lived. There is a similar feeling that you get when you think of what would have been the lives of these people if they were not tangled in the Lincoln collection. And consider what  we would have lost if they had not amassed and cared for it those many years  in spite of the unhappiness it brought.",1527897600,,717,4.450381679389313
8736068,1,B016AENK4M,"At best, this is a self-indulgent family album passed off as a documentary.  At worst, this is a thinly veiled advertisement for the sale of the Meserve-Kunhardt Collection, which was purchased by Yale University from the filmmaker around the time of the film's appearance on HBO.  The promotional value to the filmmaker and his customer should be noted at the very beginning, as it taints every other claim he makes about his family.

This film has very little to do with Abraham Lincoln.  I don't think it's a spoiler alert to point out that the Kunhardt family is not related to him.  Not surprisingly, it was produced, written, directed, and starred in by the same family.  Don't know why anyone would watch, unless the audience is the same.",1527465600,,745,4.78125
8736069,5,B016AENK4M,"Beyond a very personal look at this man and this remarkable time in our history, this film is a profoundly moving and human story about family, fathers, children, and how we struggle not just to survive but to mean something in this world.
If you can watch it with a dry eye, you have me beat.",1518393600,,293,4.25
8736070,5,B016AENK4M,Outstanding!  Had to order it after seeing it on HBO.  Fascinating and highly recommend to all.,1505779200,,95,4.875
8736071,5,B016AENK4M,Wonderful documentary.  I had seen it on tv and wanted to purchase it.  It really is about this family that collected photos about the Civil War--esp people.  The grandfather had saved from ruin photos of Lincoln and the generals.  His collection was used as a reference by the man who did the statue for the Lincoln memorial.,1490745600,,326,4.666666666666667
8736072,5,B016AENK4M,This is a fascinating look at Lincoln and the family that collected his photographs.,1490313600,,84,5.071428571428571
8736073,5,B016AENK4M,Great movie!!!  Well worth the watch.,1487116800,,37,5.166666666666667
8736074,5,B016AENK4M,Great for American history - Civil War and Presidential history Buffs. The story of a family with so many mementos about Lincoln is interesting. HBO Documentaries never disappoint.,1486857600,,180,5.464285714285714
