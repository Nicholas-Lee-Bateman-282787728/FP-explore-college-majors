7814594,5,6301715845,"Blazing Stewardesses starring Yvonne De Carlo was released in 1975. A campy movie, it does have Yvonne singing a great song in a white outfit. Fans of Yvonne De Carlo will like this the most.",1449878400,,191,4.485714285714286

7814597,1,6301715845,"Often on the twisted and abusive side with few revealing sexual scenes, but cute well figured girls -  Plots bland and mostly disconnected with being a airline stewardess.",1348617600,3,171,5.107142857142857
7814598,1,6301715845,"These films are exploitation at its most dreadful. The players are superannuated ""stars"" of '40s flix, and the comedy team of the Ritz Brothers played in nightclubs in the '40s, so there's not even a film record of them amongst movies that I saw as a kid--so their relevance to a Baby Boomer is nil. I suppose the only folks who would fully appreciate these works are veterans of World War II; this isn't work of these folk in their prime.",1215043200,,439,4.432098765432099
7814599,5,6301715845,"ok this movie is hillarious! an awsome sex romp that doesn't take itself seriously for a second. i'm not even gonna get into the story line or whatever because it is not what makes the movie at all. if you like oddball humor and sleaze then do yuorself a favor and get this double feature. plus it's limited to 20 thousand copies. i haven't watched the Naughty Stewardesses yet but as soon as my sides arn't in stiches from cracking up at the first one then i will deffinately check it out. though oddly enuff the dvd presents Blazing as the first when actually Nughty was. anyway, get this one and if you smoke....Blaze away! it's a riot.",1119225600,19,639,4.423728813559322
