8602283,5,B00E808CWQ,"This boxed set exceeded my expectations. The ""trilogy"" ostensibly covers three generations of a missionary family, from the life of the missionary leading to his death--as well as the deaths of his four companions--to the culturally successful son's return to the jungle to be with the same people who murdered his father to the grandson's coming to grips with a story he has heard too much and who doesn't particularly like missionaries anyway to... It's a gripping true story from beginning to where they all are now. It's a beautiful story of love and grace and forgiveness.",1430524800,8,577,4.958762886597938

The combo set brought the original Jim Elliot and Nate Saint story ( along with period photos and movies), the story of the next generation and finally the current Itec mission effort into our living room. Have already lent it out and hope to get it back!!",1428796800,6,346,4.421875
