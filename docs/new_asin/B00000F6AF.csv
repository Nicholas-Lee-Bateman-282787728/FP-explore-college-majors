Compared to similarly good RGB, XGB is faster, more serious, more dynamic, more mature, better written, better directed and sometimes even funnier, with much more content per minute. It has real atmosphere unlike the comical ground of the former. This superb masterpiece can sometimes even reach gripping atmosphere and true senses of emergency in the storylines. Never was a serious GB fan until I saw this. This has done great things for the GB universe.

Well done. Two thumbs up.

Also, the negative review seen here have no basis and should be thrown out the window. People want information, not biased and immature rants.",1125014400,,693,5.008695652173913

--------------------------------------------------

While the Extreme Ghostbusters series is top-notch, this video falls below average because it was recorded in the SLP/EP speed - which is usually reserved for those ""low budget"" $3.99 tapes you find on the discount rack at your local supermarket. To make matters worse, Columbia/Tristar Home Video doesn't even tell you on the video box that it was recorded in this speed. Anyway, the episodes are at least worth the money spent on this tape. (Maybe we can all pray that they release this on DVD.)",1089763200,2,1045,5.7727272727272725
