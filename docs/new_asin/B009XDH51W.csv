5370913,5,B009XDH51W,Quite possibly one of the most under rated actors of the modern era. Steven Seagal is life. I hope he gets a life time achievement award since Hollywood will never give him his much deserved Oscar.,1434672000,9,197,4.5

5370917,4,B009XDH51W,"Anytime you looking for movies, you need to ask yourself if you really want just the movie or the other version that gives you a bunch of additional material that you will likely watch once ... for me I just want a good quality copy of the movie. Noting this simply got an upscale and digital conversion, which is all anyone can hope for with older movies and that works for me.

If you are a Segal fan, this is a good option. I bought this bluray set as a Segal addition to my collection and it really meets the need. I also recall reading other reviews on it and having a laugh at the comments on the movies and now agree with them all. In short, you can spend a bit more to get Under Seige series set, Hard to Kill and Executive Decision separately but pay less and get this box set and additionally get Above the Law ... this box set wins right?

Wrong ... Above the Law was one of Segal's first leading roles and that movie is quite a disappointment. You'll likely watch the movie once and then wonder why you ever bought it ... or why it was ever made. Otherwise a great collection of movies.

Still say the best movie he ever made was Marked for Death",1423353600,6,1158,4.160714285714286

5370922,3,B009XDH51W,"I just watched 9 of what are widely considered to be Steven Seagal's best films (according to imdb, rotten tomatoes, and various top-10 Seagal lists) consecutively. Took almost 18 hours.

Of those 9 films, I found that I could only recommend 4 (assuming that you are looking for actual, enjoyable movies and not just terrible direct-to-DVD ones to make fun of):

-Under Siege
-Under Siege 2
-Hard To Kill
-Marked For Death

Maybe some of you would also like Out For Justice, although it's a below-average film in my opinion.

The good news is that Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Hard To Kill are on this set. Those are definitely his top 3 films overall.

The bad news is that also included are Above The Law and Executive Decision. Why is this bad?

Well, in the case of Above The Law, it was Seagal's first starring role ever. That might sound good, but actors typically get better over time, and his inexperience here REALLY shows. Also, they speak the word ""Nico"" about 200 times, so unless you are playing a drinking game, it gets annoying quickly. I guess they were afraid you would forget his name or something?

In the case of Executive Decision, it's very simple.

*Spoilers*

Seagal dies in the first 5 minutes, and never shows up again. It's really just a cameo. Whoever thought it would be funny to add this onto a Steven Seagal collection should really be beaten about the head and shoulders with a copy of The Glimmer Man or whatever other terrible Seagal movie you don't mind breaking.

*End spoilers*

This is a hard sell at $33, to be honest. I would get the Under Siege 1 and 2 blu-ray pack, and either Hard To Kill on its own/Marked For Death on its own, or nothing but the Under Siege movies.",1361577600,2,1713,4.511326860841424
