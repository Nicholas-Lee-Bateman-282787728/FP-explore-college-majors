If you don't remember anything about this review, remember this...you will need a Blu-ray player that will allow you to play multi-regional discs.  This disc was never intended for sale in the U.S.

I've seen them live so this doesn't match that experience, but I was excited to see the Blu-ray of their Farewell Tour.  Unless you love Powderfinger, you will not likely enjoy this.  It isn't the best live concert I've seen or heard on Blu-ray.  It's a shame they are hanging it up to do each do their own thing.",1297728000,,532,4.6063829787234045
