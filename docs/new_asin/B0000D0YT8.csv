7999560,5,B0000D0YT8,"What a breath of fresh air! As we say ""Alhamduillah"" (Praise be to God). Having had my fill of childish, one-sided history (pro-Wahabi and anti-Shia; anti-Sufi) by the Saudi-inspired propaganda about the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), I cannot recommend a better production. It's critical. It's thought provoking. I've seen the PBS program and this one--culturally--knocks it out of the box.

There are even Christian point of views that are surprisingly more reverent and knowledgeable of the Prophet and the Holy Quran than the so-called Muslims killing ""infidels"" in their ""holy wars"" around the world. The Muslim scholars (male and female) are straight shooters, passionate about Islam and culturally unique (some wear robes and headscarves and some do not). One scholar even criticizes the abuse of Ahadith (sayings of the Prophet) and its elevation above the authority of the Holy Quran. From watching this, I get the impression that the Muslims of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria--where this film is focused--are very, very diverse.

It was probing and creative. Its style was very unique (although some American documentary film makers would scoff that it is hokey). Instead of just scholars talking in front of a camera, they were talking among other scholars. Then they had wonderful scenes of Muslims from various cultures talking amongst each other, students, etc. Some were in mosques, tents and schools. They showed a Christian religious service conducted in a mosque and the girls singing praises of the Prophet while playing drums was truly delighting (taboo to Muslim extremists).

Tragically, many of the places filmed were in Beirut, Lebanon. I couldn't help but wonder if those people had been killed or if the building in which they were filmed was bombed.

This video dealt with the tough questions about spousal abuse, the relations with Jews and Christians and the despicable treatment of the Prophet's body by his so-called followers after he passed away.

However, if you're looking for a video that condemns Islam and the Prophet, this is not it. If you hate and fear Islam and Muslims, don't watch it. If you want to believe that some country's so-called War on Terror is going to free you from dealing with Islam, this is not the film to watch. You WILL be converted just by watching it. In the very least, it will crush nearly all of the stereotypes and prejudices you may have held. You will begin to realize that the real war is the conflict between those who claim to be Muslims and those who are truly Muslims (and as you'll learn from the film, those who are Christians and Jews and whatnot can also be true Believers in Islam).

We will make this film required viewing for our children when they are teens.",1155600000,19,2734,4.94553376906318
7999561,1,B0000D0YT8,"Asalam Alaikum.  I don't recommend this DVD, it has false, gross and wrong information about Muhammad (saw) and Islam.  Dont waste your money and time on this one!! Do a search online for ""authentic islamic information"" and inshAllah (God-Willing) you will find some usefull websites.  Take care.  Asalam Alaikum.",1149552000,7,313,5.326530612244898
7999562,5,B0000D0YT8,"I watched this dvd and was surprised how well it was. In my opinion it is not like other documentaries that are either for or against Islam. It resembles more a report and information about historical aspects of Mohammed and certain events. The multitude of sceneries of the middle east was nice. Many scholars around the world are in the documentary.
  This indicates that it is not just a one sided story for or against Islam.",1144368000,5,428,4.618421052631579
7999563,5,B0000D0YT8,"I was actually quite impressed with this production...

The photography was excellent and appropriate as it related to the actual sites discussed. Background music was authentic and complemented the subject matter.

There were frequent interviews with a wide variety of experts from  Islamic as well as non-Islamic sources.  Scholars as well as highly placed Muslim authorities contributed.

I thought it was mostly weighted to the Sunni version of events but there was some effort to include Shiah views at least in a kind of appendix.

Overall I would say a memorable effort and educational.",1142726400,9,593,5.25531914893617
7999564,1,B0000D0YT8,"This film not only contains gross historical and factual errors, it contain a string of misrepresentations. You are better of with another good title such as 'The legacy of the Prophet', Inside Islam - Discovery Channel', 'Islam - Empire of Faith', 'Haj - National Geographic'. (All are available from Amazon).
My copy has gone in the bin, that is where it belongs. I did however cringe and watch all of 6 hours of it, Why?",1077062400,91,423,4.653333333333333
