7809835,5,6300983390,"This movie is both entertaining and interesting as a document of Italians' life abroad, and more.  Nino  Manfredi, one of the best comedians Italy has ever had,  is wholesome in the lead role. By the way he passed away not too long ago.  The humorous tale takes a turn into  drama when 3 hoodlooms hold up the restaurant Spaghetti House, where 5 Italians work, and take them hostages. While the English police take their own time to sort things out, the leader of the gang and the lead Italian character become friends. The finale is a suprise I won't spoil for you. Great movie. It is hard to find a movie that is funny and takles serious themes at the same time. It seems that Italian movie  directors do this best.
