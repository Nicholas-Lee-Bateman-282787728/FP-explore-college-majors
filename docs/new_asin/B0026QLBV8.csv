8353421,5,B0026QLBV8,I remember hearing about Helen Keller as a child but I didn't know the whole story. I was very thankful to see her story and how encouraging it was to see what she overcame to inspire others not to give up.,1382054400,,206,4.048780487804878
8353422,4,B0026QLBV8,"My wife has had a lifelong admiration of Keller's life, times and strength.  Many know of her struggle to learn after the sickness that caused her to be blind and deaf.  A Broadway play and two movies have given the public a slight look into her life. The book goes beyond that and leaves one feeling blessed just to have read about her.",1379030400,,337,4.333333333333333

8353426,5,B0026QLBV8,"I have been a huge fan of Helen Keller for over forty years and have never seen live footage of her, of her beloved teacher, Annie Sullivan, and her subsequent companion Polly Thompson.  Although Helen was in her old age when this was filmed, there was plenty of information, photos, and footage with her to reveal her extraordinary life and accomplishments from even her younger years.  This documentary also has the only surviving footage of Annie Sullivan's voice as she and Helen demonstrate how Helen learned to speak, albeit not normally.  I loved seeing her move, how she read, and how she traveled the world and inspired countless people and especially those who, like her, were afflicted with blindness and/or deafness.

One thing that jumps out as obvious is that it is easy to see that she was coached to always maintain a serene and happy composure.  She is nearly always smiling.  I read that she was told from a very young age that when she was in public to remember that nobody would be attracted to an unhappy handicapped person.  She obviously took this to heart because even at her home at Arcan Ridge she smiles as she reads, does dishes, fetches items for Polly, answers her mail, and even takes a walk along the special fence built just for her.

I highly recommend this documentary to anyone who loves and admires Helen as much as I do.  This film was better than I had hoped it would be.  Enjoy!",1362787200,2,1418,4.613545816733068
8353427,4,B0026QLBV8,"While this is an excellent movie depicting Helen Keller's amazing life, I am surprised that a movie about someone who championed for the rights of the disabled and was blind/deaf herself, would have NO captions.  We use closed captioning all the time as even for hearing individuals, sometimes what is said, is not clear.  I cannot believe this DVD was made without closed captions for the hearing-impaired.  Other than that, an excellent and fascinating account of the life of Helen Keller.",1301616000,2,491,5.037037037037037
