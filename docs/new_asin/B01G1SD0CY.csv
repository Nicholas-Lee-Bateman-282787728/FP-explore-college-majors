7753248,1,B01G1SD0CY,"The aridity and barrenness of the desert is surpassed only by the vacuity of the film. Christian spirituality proves to be a terra incognita for Rodrigo Garca. Look elsewhere is you are expecting any penetration into Christ's ministry. The story line is remarkable in that it fails on so many levels: antithetical to the biblical text, theologically vacuous, and bereft of a moral message. Presenting Christ as a bewildered wanderer in the desert, leaves the viewer searching aimlessly for a meaning.",1470700800,,500,5.185185185185185

7753250,3,B01G1SD0CY,"Thank you Broadgreen for sending us this DVD to review!

The fourth chapter in the book of Matthew mentions Jesus going into the wilderness to be tempted and fasting for forty days and nights.  The Bible tells about three of the temptations, but the movie Last Days In The Desert uses some artistic license to add many more.  The beginning of this hour and thirty-eight minute movie is a bit slow starting as it shows the Holy man as Hes referred to wandering aimlessly in the desert.  Youll see Him sleeping and hear Him praying for guidance to His Heavenly Father and even laughing at the wind blowing sticks around.  Later on in the film He laughs at a fart too.

While Hes never called Jesus, Satan who is also played by Ewan McGregor (He's Jesus too) refers to Him as Yeshua.  Satan takes on many forms, but is most often identical in appearance to Jesus.  One of the forms Satan takes on is that of a topless woman whose hair covers the otherwise  would be seen nipples.

During Jesus fasting in the desert He happens upon a nomad family that is struggling emotionally.  Their mother is deathly ill while the adolescent son and father barely communicate and cannot relate to one another.  The father is a skilled carpenter and wishes for his son to live in the desert with him, but the son longs to set his own destiny in Jerusalem.  The mother wishes for him to fulfill his dreams as well, but the family cannot afford an apprenticeship for him.

Satan offers a wager to Jesus to fix this family and even tells Him of their future had Jesus not crossed paths with them.  I found it odd that Satan could see the future, but Jesus couldn't in this film.  Jesus was able to foresee many events including His own death (Matt 26:2), betrayal (Matt 26:21), resurrection (Matt 16:21), coming of the Holy Spirit (John 14:26), and even the destruction of Jerusalem (Luke 19:43-44).  Even though Jesus is perceived as weak (despite eating) and doubting of His abilities, there is a decent story about humanity, family, and relationships in this film.  Just don't expect much Biblical content because much of it goes against Gods word.",1470528000,5,2131,4.607427055702917
7753251,4,B01G1SD0CY,"The desert can be a harsh and unforgiving environment that inspires people to face their true selves for better or for worse.  This story seems to take place over the last week or so of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting and praying at age 30.  None of this seems inconsistent with scripture, though I admit little is directly supported.  The troubled family in the tent is only marginally interesting, but they provide great pawns for the daily struggles between Jesus and his physical clone Satan.  The sarcastic exchanges between the two opposing Ewan McGregors make for the most engaging moments of the film.  You truly get an idea of the boredom and tedium a fallen angel might feel roaming the earth for thousands of years.",1470355200,5,726,4.73015873015873
7753252,4,B01G1SD0CY,"I usually don't like giving reviews about movies because my taste will differ from yours. It is the reason why I never listen to movie critics. So if you want to watch this movie do so because you want to see it for yourself not because of a review. You may find yourself disappointed or maybe glad that you saw it.

Don't watch this movie for the story that is told (you may not like it), but watch it for the message that it shares (Jesus was very much human like you and I). I'm a devout Christian and are a dozen negative things I can write about the movie, but doing so would make you lose interest in watching it. If you watch this movie, watch it because of the message that it shares with the viewers. I ignored the things I disliked and watch the movie until the end and I was happy.

If you are curious what some of the negative things are, then here is a small list: He drinks water in which we know the Bible tells us no food or drink crossed his lips when he fasted. He spends time in the desert with a family he meets. This is something that is not biblical. He doesn't show off any of his miracles, and he's a bit clumsy with words. There are other things so on and so forth.

The things that made me like this movie were: He's attempting to communicate with God on his journey but doesn't hear his voice, just like most Christians and people in the world today. He struggles with his humanity. He is very caring and wants to help people but doesn't know how. This version of Jesus is very human in the sense that you don't see his divine power manifested, his relationship with satan is a bit odd but in the way that you can tell the two had relationship once as master and worker. The movie itself isn't grandeur but we get to see Jesus in a new way. This movie makes you think about Jesus humanity rather than his divine characteristics. Near the end of his journey in the desert, I like the interaction between Jesus and Satan. Satan knows the time has come for the Lord to do his great works and so Satan makes Jesus an offer for when the day that Jesus finds himself on the cross.

I am not really great at giving movie reviews so watch this film because you want to see it for yourself and judge it for yourself.",1470182400,29,2234,4.164351851851852
7753253,1,B01G1SD0CY,If you are a Bible believing Christian you will find this film to be non-Biblical. Worse than the Ridley Scott movie Noah. My recommendation is not to buy.,1470182400,2,155,4.571428571428571
7753254,4,B01G1SD0CY,"I found this film to a be an interesting depiction of Jesus' struggle to connect to his father, God. I loved how that was illustrated through the example of the family and I found the performances to be really well done, especially by Ewan McGregor as Jesus and Satan. The only thing I wished this film did was go a little deeper, or make a stand. The more I think on it however, my gut tells me the filmmakers may have left it open to interpretation to invite the viewer to ponder the events in the film.
 I do think it's interesting when people see this film and are upset because this exact story is not found in the Bible. To me, this film should be look at more as a commentary, similar to books written by C.S. Lewis or Dietrich Bonhoeffer. It's a film about trying to reach God and feeling like there is no answer. It's a struggle Christians have always faced, even the best of us. I appreciate the film for just asking the question, did Jesus every have any doubts? I think the answer is always doubt and faith go hand in hand. Faith is believing...but not necessarily knowing.",1496361600,4,1085,4.344827586206897
7753255,5,B01G1SD0CY,"This movie may not sit well with certain varieties of Christians. Jesus (Ewan MacGregor), is returning alone from his 40 days in the desert, is very human, humble, quiet, and wrestling with his own demons, particularly in regard to his identity, as seen in his conversations with his double/shadow side/Satan (also played by MacGregor). The identity of this other character, whom no one else sees or hears, is debatable. There's certainly an element of sibling rivalry of the ""dad always liked you best"" variety, yet the two don't really seem to be enemies. They listen to one another. Jesus also listens to, and does what he can to help the small family he encounters, who live in isolation in what seems to be the most inhospitable region possible. In the end, it may not seem like much to some viewers, whereas I would say it is everything. This is a quiet, meditative film, and if it is approached in that spirit, it can be immensely rewarding, raising more questions than it answers, perhaps, but with an ending that just feels right (not counting the last couple of minutes, which I found annoying on my first viewing, though the second time they were much less so).",1494892800,3,1172,4.721951219512195

7753263,5,B01G1SD0CY,"Very beautiful and poignant portrayal of a chapter of Christ's life. I loved how much it relied on poetic imagery to tell the story of Christ's relationship with mankind, instead of trying to do it ""by-the-book."" There are so many artistic choices in this film that I really appreciate but won't write here because that would spoil their beauty and originality to someone who hasn't seen the movie. Don't watch this movie expecting a play-by-play of the biblical accounts. The film is true to the spirit of Christ's compassion for humankind but has enough original poetic imagery to make you think about Christ's ministry in a fresh way.",1484352000,8,637,4.907407407407407
7753270,4,B01G1SD0CY,"I liked this more than a lot of critics and friends, finding a gentle poetic power in some of the sequences, and appreciating the humanness of this simple telling as the end of Jesus' 40 days in the desert before he returned to civilization to face challenges and death.

Devoid of demands the audience believe in a literal way, I could be more open the exploration of complexities of faith and spiritual ethics that challenge everyone, even the son of god. I particularly liked the scenes where Ewen McGregor plays both Jesus and Satan, debating  among other things - the nature of God, and whether He is essentially good, or an over-controlling ego-maniac. McGregor does a lovely job separating the two characters with subtle touches like vocal rhythms and a different glint in the eye (there's no attempt to make the look different, signifying perhaps that the Devil is indeed an inevitable part of all humans, including this holy one).

On the other hand, the main story line created for the film  Jesus getting caught up in the domestic troubles of a dysfunctional desert family  is more uneven. There are indeed touching scenes, and it was refreshing to see a biblical story where Jesus can't simply bring happiness to this angry father, dying mother and alienated son with a wise word or a wave of his hand. On the other hand, at times it feels simply too prosaic, too small scale and too familiar. I think that's part of the point. Basic human struggle has changed very little in 2,000 years. But it also led to the occasional cringe-worthy moment, as when Jesus councils the father about the wayward son; 'talk to him about something he's interested in', sounding more like a friendly neighbor or basketball coach than the son of God. More important it wasn't clear (at least to me) how Jesus' encounter with this family effects his thinking or perceptions about his own difficult relationship with his own Father or terrifying fate going forward. What does he know or understand now that he didn't before?

Last, the film steals a key last minute twist from another cinematic version of the Christ tale, and I was distracted by the imitation.

In the end this was sort of a split decision. My mind found many faults with the film, some serious, but my heart was touched and involved.",1483833600,3,2293,4.7462311557788945
7753271,5,B01G1SD0CY,"I was beginning to think I just don't like movies any more.  Or at least any movie made within the last ten or twenty years.  Movies are too fast paced, without any character devolopment, and over edited.  I have become accustomed to jam-down-your-throat plot exposition as the only character development, on top of a story that appears to have had ten writers and ten rewrites.  Star Wars 7, and the new Ben Hur both scream mega-studio-board-room-survey-says-BS.  I want a movie written by one writer, put together by one director, who actually has something to say- not what the metrics indicate the average American wants to see.  This movie was just what I needed to make me like movies again.  If you like the original Ben Hur, the original Star Wars, and can handle a simple yet meaningful story told linearly with great art direction and heart, watch this movie.

7753272,3,B01G1SD0CY,"Interesting take on the temptations of Christ.
It did not deal with the total story, only the temptation to be the answer for the world's problems. That portrayal was adequate, although I didn't get any feel for the relationship of Christ to God in the movie.
I would not recommend it for someone who does not know the Bible because of the weak similarity to the story in the Bible. I would not want a person to think this is all there is to Jesus Christ.

Action is almost non existent so this may not be a film for you. However if you are interesting in a good story, open ended possibilities, and a Jesus who is very Human, this film will deliver. I enjoyed Jesus playing coy about who he truly was and not being flashy with his devine powers. He was soul searching, not out looking to draw attention to himself. I left the movie wanting more questions answered. But that, is the beauty of this particular film.",1480204800,,607,4.4774774774774775

7753276,1,B01G1SD0CY,"Heretical if not Blasphemous!!!!!!

I am no theologian, by any scholarly means, but you need not be one to find the heresies (and there's a whole treasury of them) within this film.
First off, and in full agreeance with Bishop Baron, they limit the movie to Jesus being an utter man, and nothing else.
2: Absolutely nothing is Biblical within this film.  (SPOILER ALERT)-even at the end when the show the Crucifixion for less than 5 minutes; they pierce Jesus BEFORE his death-any Christian should at least know that they pierced Our Lord after his death to make sure that he was dead, and that they needed not break his bones to quicken the death.
3: Satan calls GOD a ""CREATION"" of all things-Yes sure the CREATOR, has now become a lowly creation-unless you're mormon I'm sure no one believes this--  Yes I do know Satan is the ""Father of lies"", and I can withstand many of the heretical ideas stated by Satan's role in this movie due to this (otherwise this list'd be days long) but I don't think even Satan would call GOD a CREATION.
4:  Jesus more than once asks Satan if he knows the future/to show him the future-Jesus: True God, and True man, even if still learning things as a human, Knows, and always has known that God is the only one who knows the future, unless he gives Divine knowledge-yes even to daemons sometimes-to know the future, so Jesus-once again True God and True man-would have at least known that Satan couldn't know without HIS FATHER'S will, and in that case Jesus probably would have known previous to this himself-as he does many times within the Gospels.  Thus Jesus wouldn't have even been tempted to ask Satan of all beings-the Father of Lies-for the future.
5:  Probably the worst one: Jesus asks Satan-once again of all creatures-The Father of Lies--what it is like to be in God's presence ""Is there a face?""  WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING WRITERS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
6: And just for Kicks ----Oh yeah BTW's  we're in a multiverse, and everything is resurrected from a previous experiment (God is truly ugly if we are to believe this) -and yes I know this is another lie from the Satan character of this movie; however, Jesus buys it, as is seen later in the film, thus either Jesus is portrayed as as gullible as my 3 year old son, or it is the Truth of this film, and what they want to sell you on.
7: Jesus commits Simulation-the action form of lying-(Already stated before: nothing about this movie is Biblical so) forget that Jesus drank water in the desert during a fast (not Biblically) he snuck a piece of food while the father character had his back turned, then acted as if he were still on his fast- granted the next scene might be the only theologically sound part that the movie had in it-due to this, the Satan character was able to tempt him further with the form of the woman and stated ""You're an easy target because you are weak""-I am not saying that Jesus ever sinned-in fact that's why I wrote this bullet because it portrays him sinning, what I am saying that if one falls out of the state of grace, they are a much easier target for the devils surrounding him/her at all times to tempt them.
8: Oh yeah, lets just play the ""Nice Jesus"" who never offends/rebukes anyone-in all of the discussions had within this movie Jesus is always afraid to offend, or say anything negative at all-one scene the boy states something entirely New-Age ""When I am out there, I feel as though I am everything, and everything is me""- and the Jesus character of the film has more than enough time to rebuke him, but instead stays silent.
There are far more errors in this movie, if you truly want to see it, though I suggest not under consequences of being in a near state of sin, you better know your Christianity or you'll be blown away-just like the ""Davinci Code (HOAX)"" blew so many away.",1478736000,2,3815,4.518840579710145

7753278,4,B01G1SD0CY,"Interesting movie. As a Christian, I did enjoy it. Please note this is a good movie, but it is a story based on speculations of what Jesus may have seen, done or thought while in the desert and even why He was there.  Gives you a point of view of Jesus as a man but not scripturally based, it's a fictional story based on Christs temptations and time in the desert and doesn't imply or try to be anything else either.

7753280,1,B01G1SD0CY,"The Positive: beautiful desert scenery, skilled cinematography, and a solid performance by McGregor.

Negative:The story, whilehaving an exciting premise (seeing Jesus beingtemptedin thedesert by the devil)was very unsatisfying because of the meaninglessness and ambiguityof the message/theme of the movie.

Some people may appreciate the way this movie emphasizes the humanity of Jesus e.g. he stumbles over his words, seems to lack confidence, laughs ata fart, is indecisive, can't figure out what's going on, participates ina dumb/fatal rock repelling incident,and is confusedby pain and death. However, in an attempt to show us the humanity of Jesus the filmmakerhas gone so far as to hideHis divinity. Jesus in this filmis more of a seeker than a Messiah. He's not on a mission. He's trying to find out if God even hears His prayers. We don't see Him authoritativelyquoting the Scriptures or askingheart-revealing questionswhen asked questions, but instead giving generic answers. For example, with the desert family, Jesus is mostly awell-meaning, but ineffective family counselor who givesmediocre advice, ""have you tried talking to him"". He seems helpless to help them, andhe's even aware of his ownhollow advice during one self-analysis moment.

 Is this a Jesus before He knew He was divine? Which according to the Bible, He knew from a young age (Luke 2:49). I think this deity-confused Jesus comes from the same bible as Russell Crowe's Noah. ;)

The film also doesn't care to have characters from that historic time e.g. Jews/nomads in that areadidn't burn dead bodies--they buried them. Also, the son character has a 21st century perspective, and doesn't have the viewpoint of someone from that time and place.

Overall, the best scenes are in the trailer, and the movie itself has nothing to come back to because it has nothing to give but confusion and doubt. What we see is a weak Jesus, who is not ""one with His Father"" and is seen dying, but not resurrecting. Where's the hope and good news of the Gospel? Not here.",1477267200,5,2034,5.167173252279635

7753282,2,B01G1SD0CY,"Before viewing Last Days in the Desert last night, I had not seen the Amazon reviews for this movie.  That was a mistake.  The average of all 65 reviews is 2.8 stars and 44% of the reviews were either one or two stars.  Can so many people be wrong about this film?  Yes, but in this case, the reviewers are not wrong.  Heres why.

Writer/Director Rodrigo Garcia is uncertain about the story is his telling.  Does Jesus know that he is the son of God?  Garcia leaves us in the dark about this question.  His Jesus appears throughout the film to be confused about his identity.  This is difficult for us to understand because following Jesus from the beginning to the end of the film is a person who appears and disappears and who is the identical twin of Jesus and who speaks to Jesus disparagingly about God.  This identical twin is the devil and he knows that Jesus has extraordinary powers.  Actually, Jesus himself knows this for at the end of the film he lays his hands on a sick woman to heal her, over the loud objections of his twin, the devil.

In the wilderness Jesus meets and befriends a small family of husband, the sick woman mentioned, and teenage son.  The forty days and forty nights of solitude and fasting are interrupted as Jesus works with the father and son to build a small structure out of stone  where the stone comes from is a mystery.  The father immediately recognizes that Jesus is a holy man and treats him respectfully.  We viewers are now confused.  Why does Jesus stay with the family?  Fasting, solitude, and meditation were his reasons for going into the desert and these purposes are seriously compromised for no good reason.

The forty days comes to an end and Jesus leaves behind the sick woman, who has refused his help.  She is left alone to die, her husband dead and her son deserting her.  As Jesus walks toward civilization we see in the distance a city, presumably Jerusalem.  Our next scene is Jesus on the cross dying.  Did Jesus ever come to understand who he is and his purpose on earth?  Director Garcia does not make it clear if Jesus came to the full realization that He and the Father are One.

Now Jesus is taken down from the cross and placed inside a burial cave and many stones are placed at the entrance to the cave, not the one stone that closed the tomb mentioned in the Bible.  In front of the cave are half dozen or so mourners sleeping or resting.  Was there a resurrection?  We cant be certain about this important question, for we end the film with a shot of two modern tourists in the desert, one taking a picture of the other.  Actually, this ending is appropriate for it is as confused and out of place as everything else in this ill thought out and badly directed film.

Why am I giving this movie two stars?  The acting was excellent.  Ewan McGregor and Ciaran Hinds do their best with what they are given, which is not much; but both are so talented that they can make something out of almost nothing.

I did not mind that writer/director Garcia decided to be creative about this Bible story, but we do require him to be thoughtful and give us something better than the confused mess that he presents to us.  These are strong words, but in the end, the film did seem like a mess of scattered scenes with no unifying principle ending in more confusion and doubt.  I wish I had read at least some of the negative reviews on Amazon and saved myself two hours of time.  Hopefully, this review will serve the purpose of warning off any would be viewers of this badly written and directed film.",1477008000,2,3557,4.425269645608629

7753285,5,B01G1SD0CY,"Last Days in the Desert is not a Christian film, don't let the characters or subject matter fool you, but I thought it was definitely an interesting, and more human, interpretation of the Temptation of Jesus, or at least the time close to the end of it. Ewan McGregor does an incredible job as Yeshua aka Jesus as well as his adversary the Accuser aka the Devil/Satan/Lucifer. The story revolves around Yeshua on His forty day fast, encountering a young boy and his parents who live in the wilderness, showing the development of their relationship over a few days. Alongside of that, Yeshua is constantly being visited by the Devil, who appears to look just like Him in an attempt to throw off the Messiah's guard.

This film is interesting when you examine the story in the Bible itself because it not only embellishes on what the Word says but adds. Now, I'm not advocating that we need to or should add to the Scriptures, that would be heresy, but from a filmmaking perspective this film does something interesting with the person of Jesus and the beginning of His ministry. This all being said as a believer and follower of Christ myself, I obviously understand that this film is a work of fiction, I understand this as a filmmaker as well, and on that basis alone I do enjoy the film. The cinematography is excellent.

If you would like to read the real story of Jesus' forty day fast in the desert, I would suggest reading Matthew 4:1-11, Mark 1:12-13, and Luke 4:1-13.

7753304,5,B01G1SD0CY,"One thing I've learned is that when it comes to religious & spiritual beliefs, whatever a person believes lives for that person; everything is personal and subjective, and nothing provable. So, in discussing this film I must use ""I"" repeatedly, since this is my opinion, of course. Do not watch this film if you believe that the Gospels are absolute truth, word for word, and that any film must follow those texts to the letter. Do not watch this film if you are disturbed by the main character having the proper Aramaic name Yeshua, rather than ""Jesus"" which is a transliteration from Aramaic to Greek, Greek to Latin, Latin to English, improperly pronounced. That's one of many aspects of this film I liked, as well as the adversary ( we know that the name ""Satan"" is derived from the Aramaic word for ""adversary"") appearing as a perfect double of Yeshua - both of course played by Ewan. I found the acting of the small cast top notch, and the spare screenplay has a great deal to say about the nature of man and god, obedience to the father, love, self reliance and responsibility, our overall reality and perception of it, and more. I  liked this film so much that I watched it twice on Amazon streaming, and then bought the DVD.",1475193600,3,1233,4.579185520361991

This story takes place JUST BEFORE Yeshua (aka Jesus) started his ministry.  He's not the Holy man wowing the crowds with his sermons, he's not great at communicating and he's unsure if he's up to the task that he knows he is destined for.

Me personally, I'm a sucker for this genre, as I tend to love non-gospel stories about Jesus (Last Temptation of Christ) versus movies like The Passion that are literalist to the Gospels.  I think it does a good job of capturing what I suspect Jesus was feeling before he began his ministry.  If you like a fast-paced story that you don't have to think too much, this isn't the movie for you.

I also like that it went with the McGregor's natural voice.  I think actors doing accents is often distracting in movies set in this time and place.",1473897600,2,943,4.4476744186046515

7753330,4,B01G1SD0CY,"I so enjoyed the film that I rented it twice, but I must mention two huge biases.  First of all, I'm a huge E. McGregor fan, even though here he's playing someone who has been out in the desert alone over a month and is realistically filthy and grungy.  There are certain lines he delivered that I found beautifully touching, even though I know McGregor is not a believer (and I very much so am).  My next equally big bias is that this was shot nearly in my backyard!  I live by the Salton Sea, just below the Anza Borrego State Park and have camped there many times and often drive past that huge dry lake (Clark Lake) shot in two sections of the film.  The film has lines and many fantastic wide shots of this park, California's largest state park, that bring out the beautiful eeriness of a vast desert.  I loved all the characters--the boy was darn good, the father spoke with such a classy enunciation and the mother had the look of a biblical era beauty.  Some reviewers were bored, but I don't think they understood how a film like this absolutely must have long silences--I found them so beautiful.  Actually most of such prolonged scenes were accompanied by the the most beautiful violin music.  I downloaded the soundtrack and play it often, though only when I'm alone.  (The people I'm around most of the time would dismiss it as far too sad.)  Despite all these kudos, I knocked off a point because though Jesus does clearly contradict the Devil in the film by insisting, ""No, I am the only one"" as far as Sons of God, it otherwise portrays him pretty much as any other guy looking for God in the desert (we do get a few out coming here on such a mission).  Also I know how having the resurrection pop up at the end of a film is hard to pull off with Freytag's pyramid of dramatic plot structure, but without it, again he is just another dude in the desert, and that's not how most of us willing to sit through over an hour of a slow film about Jesus have experienced him at all.  Nevertheless, this is not just a beautiful film, but also one that is good to stimulate more of the age-old discussion about the humanity and divinity of Christ.",1473638400,3,2154,4.355

7753337,5,B01G1SD0CY,"This here is one of those ""art films."" In other words, not for the Nascar hat-wearing, beer-belching, sportsball crowd. That means it has few actors, little dialogue, not much of a story. But it more than makes up for it with a truckload of one-shot, disjointed, vivid imagery that often makes little sense. That's probably because it's up to you what to make of it. Like the brief, out-of-nowhere dream (?) scene of Jesus bolting from a pack of angry wolves. Or the other out-of-nowhere scene of Jesus stuck in a raging current of water. Or the brief glimpse of Jesus levitating above the desert surface. Or the tourist who takes a digital picture of the other tourist. (I think I have that one figured out: they were shooting a rom-com, and happened into the wrong set.) What does it mean? Who knows. It's up to you. That's the nature of the art film.
But this movie does have some things that no other movie about Jesus has. For example, somebody passes gas. And there's a demonic serpent hag. Oh, and there's also a demonic topless temptress. But it's a PG-rated topless temptress, because she's the type that has long hair covering where the garfunkles are.
So what are we left with? Shots of a forlorn-looking Jesus walking with a youth, when they see a buzzard in the sky attacking another bird.
Well, there is somewhat of a story, but it's really second place to the imagery. Jesus is wandering in the desert, looking dirty. Satan is there too, slightly better dressed. Jesus happens upon a shack and a few tents, housing a family consisting of a creaky father, a teenage youth, and a deathly ill, much younger mother. Leave it to Satan to appear as a topless temptress trying to suggest that he shag the sickly younger mother. Jesus looked at the audience and basically said, ""I know this is the temptation of Christ and all, but seriously. I've seen better gazongas on my uncle Herb, you know, Mary's brother."" Of course there's no way Jesus was going to go for that, because after all, he's Jesus. Fasting and chastity were his bag, baby.
But the family was in a quandary. The old man lived in fear. He's scared of anything outside of his little comfort zone in the desert. But the youth wants the bright lights, big band music, and after-hours hot spots of Roman-occupied Jerusalem. And the mother seems ready to expire at any moment. Satan basically challenges Jesus to do something about it.
And by the time all's said and done, who knows what really happened. Something happened, that's for sure, thanks to the old man's bright idea of rappelling down a cliff face to mine for some precious rock. But does Jesus heal the mother? And what happens to the youth? Who knows.
Overall, this is a good movie, but not for the evangelical, ""God's Not Dead"" crowd. This movie is cerebral. ""Christian"" movies are not. This movie doesn't have an axe to grind, a message to force down people. It's a character study. With three-inch long desert roaches for some reason.
It's a Jesus who really is the Son of God, but who doesn't act like it. Instead, he's a nice guy who tries to give out good advice, resist the devil, not shag the sick, and fulfill his mission in life. And a devil who tempts Christ up until the end, even offering Jesus help off the cross if he wants it.
A good movie. Just leave your Bibles on the shelf.",1473033600,9,3327,4.555926544240401

7753342,5,B01G1SD0CY,"Like many photoplays with this story and theme, it will probably find a small, yet appreciative audience.  That is understandable by mainstream interests, when someone is searching for the popular action adventure, thriller, rollercoaster storyline.  It is encouraging to see that movies of this type and calibur can still be made and released in the mainstream entertainment environment that is the usual offering in the industry.
  This movie is a beautifully rendered observation of how one human, whos only goal is to relay his message about what he knows and feels in an altruistic way.  It does not cater to any doctrine specifically-(unless you, the veiwer want it to)-, yet it is a very spiritual, yet thought provoking drama, that is wrought with dialogue that, upon the first viewing, you might easily miss the nuances hidden in it.
  What is most intriguing about this production is it's quality and deep subtleties.  For myself, the storytellers behind this ""imagining"", have a very clear understanding of the sincere, indescribable love that the ""holyman"" has for his multidimensional, omniscient ""father"" creator.  His search for the method to relay his feelings and knowledge he has to others in an efective and lasting way.
  The soundtrack is so well matched to the protrayal and beautiful desert scenery, for that alone, I have watched it twice and have ordered the DVD -(as there seems to be no bluray version available)-with the intention of watching several times more.
  Again, this is a film that you must see as if you might be an unseen eyewitness to a series of mysterious events to ponder what they truly mean.  There are some lines that are revealed during the dialogue with the ""holyman's"" companion ""spirit"", that, if you are a knowledgeable or ""aware"" person, you will note, that whoever wrote this dialogue, knows much more than the average writer on this story.",1472428800,3,1894,5.028846153846154

The dialogue is loose in its simplicity, offering glimpses of the characters, though not offering enough to fully understand them. The story is familiar enough, if you know the Biblical story of Jesus 40 days in the desert, but widely departs from the ecclesial accounts. The cinematography is wonderful, depicting the desert as it should be: sparse, lonely, and unforgiving. The movie drags in places, could have been tightened up, the characters given a little more depth, and the dialogue could have provided this depth. If you know the traditional ecclesial/biblical story, you want Jesus to perform, so its a bit of a let down when he doesnt do so, yet if you're drawn to the enigmatic story of Jesus, though not wanting to actually attend church service, this story will draw you in, captivate you. The story, like the original oral stories of Jesus, is befuddling, captivating, and expects the listener/viewer to go deeper. So on that note, the movie works well.",1472342400,2,1142,4.953125

7753354,1,B01G1SD0CY,"Love Ewan McGregor. Love off-script Bible stories. Love the location. Simply gorgeous and evocative. Ciaran Hinds is always wonderful, and he works with what he has here to the best of his abilities. I have no problem with the depiction of Jesus as a man like the rest of us, unsure, searching, troubled, and unsatisfied, but where is the counterpoint. Boy unable to express himself to his father. Father, same, with son. Jesus, frankly, the same with both of them. The only one he seems to connect with with any actual passion is his brief attempt to heal the wife/mother. Everyone in this movie (though it drips with the desire to be called 'film') is ineffectual. Nobody comes out and says what he/she means, except, of course, Satan -- a much more lively McGregor. I'll never understand why some film makers equate such long silences, so many establishing shots, and monochrome palates with depth and substance. It comes off as filler here for what is, despite its potential, a very light-weight story. If I need to read a treatise on what I've missed, i.e. nuance, human condition, fallibility, compassion, blah, blah, blah, Jesus's humanity, etc, then the story as it has been told, fails. Like it does here. I say it is a great idea, to explore just what Christ may have encountered on his retreat, but I couldn't help sensing that the writer/director Rodrigo Garcia, while obviously passionate about his story, has superimposed a decent fable-ish short story over a blank spot in the greatest story ever told. It's so overly thoughtful, that nothing stands out. Even the tragedy has no resonance to the story itself. Each character lays out what they need, in excessively earnest dialogue, yet as the movie unfolds, none of them are heard by the others, not the son, not the father, and definitely not the Man. I'm really left scratching my head at this one, that I eagerly plopped down my money for, as to what the hell this was about. And if you can't explain it to me without being a biblical scholar or the deepest soul ever, why bother? Basically, it sucked.",1471305600,9,2071,4.7555555555555555

If you decide to watch this movie and do not know the Bible well please do not mistake it for Truth.  Jesus was not weak, feeble minded, or confused about who He was or who His Father was.
