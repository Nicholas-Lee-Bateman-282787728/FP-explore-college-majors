4262655,5,B0009S9LQC,"At a time when you couldn't get away from Whoopie Goldberg's movie wrath, this film is one of a few that could keep them from subliminally shoving Whoopie down our throats! Liliana Komorowska tears up the screen as she gives the best ""scanner face"" yet. We are deprived until she comes out of her shell with her scientist father's experimental scanner calm drug, doing the opposite and gives her the itch for exploding heads and world takeover! We have to forgive her because she's such a babe and she's helping us forget about whoopie! Her brother, a canadian monk living in thailand? Does not forgive her as he fights his way from Bangkok to North America against Liliana's army of NRA, kung fu scanner baddies. The camera is forced to love him as he gets a quarter of an inch away from it with the most devastating scanner face since his sister. You are counting facial veins every five minutes as they scream for their own screen credits. The sweat is pouring off their faces as each scanner competes to see which one can crack the camera lense. The brother can't even find enough time to go to the toilet because there's so many assassins looking for him and during the motorycle chase you see him desperately watching as he zooms past all the portapodies. I missed this in theaters because I thought they would sneak in a Whoopie trailer. Liliana's french accent had me from hello as I was a mesmerized puppet in her control. Unfortunately her brother's head does not explode at the end and the camera had to divorce itself from Liliana's unblemished, 90's made up, female magnetism. I don't regret getting sidetracked in this review and hope they post it. Brilliant action dominates the entire film with great stunts, special effects, chases, and cool story line.",1384041600,3,1770,4.712903225806452
4262656,4,B0009S9LQC,"I'm a big fan of Scanners especially the original scanners film by David cronenberg which is a classic
but Scanners II is pretty Good and Scanners III is a bit ridiculous but still Good.
any fan of Scanners knows what scanners II & III are about, they're both similar to the original

Scanners II was released in 1990 but was a Direct to video release
i don't think it was shown in many cinemas, if it was shown in some Cinemas
then it would have been a short run
Scanners III was no different, it was released in Cinemas 1 year after Scanners II
again Direct to Video after a short run playing in some cinemas.
both Scanners II and III never got a U.S. DVD release ever
both Scanners films were only released on Anchor bay DVD in the U.K. back in 2003
so both scanners films have only been available in the U.K. on Anchor bay DVD.

Until now this year, scream factory who's part of shoutfactory in L.A. California
finally got the copyright to release both films on DVD and Blu-ray for the first time ever in the U.S.
both films on DVD and blu-ray are in Widescreen format
i didn't bother watching the DVD version cause the Audio quality is only in Dolby stereo
so i just assumed the picture quality would be average anyway
i only watched the blu-ray of both films in HD surround sound
i was blown away and amazed, the picture quality looks fantastic in blu-ray
the Audio quality is even better in High Definition surround sound
scream factory really Did make an effort to enhance the picture and audio quality
this blu-ray version is better quality than the U.K. Anchor bay release for sure.
Definitely worth getting this blu-ray release if your a big fan of scanners II & III

now about the special features, there is none at all not even a Trailer
very very unfortunate that there is no making of featurette
there's no interview with Director Christian Duguay or even Producer Pierre David
who produced all 3 scanner films which i thought Pierre David should've been interviewed at least.
there's not even an Audio commentary by the Christian Duguay or Pierre David
i did email scream factory about the special features the person that emailed me back
said to me that Christian Duguay and Pierre David wasn't interested and declined
to be interviewed for this blu-ray release for some reason
the person who emailed did not give me details so i just had to accept it.

you only get 2 films on 1 Blu-ray/DVD Disc which is better than nothing
so all you do is choose which film you want on the Menu that is it.
considering this blu-ray is the first time both films have been released on dvd or blu-ray in the U.S.
be Grateful for that
but it's Definitely worth the money for the Blu-ray quality for sure
i gave this blu-ray/dvd combo 4 stars based on that
if there was any extras at all like an interview with Christina Duguay or Pierre David
or even an audio commentary i would have given this blu-ray 5 star rating.

but Definitely worth the money just to watch both films in High Definition Audio regardless",1380067200,7,3010,4.485401459854015
4262657,4,B0009S9LQC,"****No Plot Spoilers****

  Ever since watching Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/B0047E9TRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>) and ""The Fury"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fury/dp/B000G6BLO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fury</a>), I've been obsessed with telekinesis.  The Scanners franchise also fulfilled my desire to watch people move objects with their thoughts.  The original ""Scanners"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scanners/dp/B00005K3NY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scanners</a>) was directed by David Cronenberg who became famous for his controversial science fiction horror films starring controversial actors [e.g., ""The Brood"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brood/dp/B00009PY2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brood</a>), with brawler hunk Oliver Reed, and ""Rabid"" (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rabid/dp/B0001XAKUQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rabid</a>) with former porn star Marilyn Chambers].  ""Scanners"" focuses on an emotionally disturbed, homeless scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) who meets an art gallery assistant, Kim Obrist (supermodel Jennifer O'Neill) who is also a scanner.  Together, they attempt to locate an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants the scanners to rule the world.  During their quest, they discover the dark secret concerning the origin of scanners.  Note: Scanners not only have the ability to move objects with their thoughts, but they can also read (i.e., scan) and manipulate other people's thoughts.  However, many become insane because of sensory overload.

  Having owned ""Scanners"" on DVD for years, I was naturally thrilled to learn that Shout Factory had released its first two sequels as a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack.  I saw them on VHS too many years ago in muted, full-frame formats.  Thanks to Shout Factory, each film has been presented correctly in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  All colors are bright, clear and crisp and the audio is great (DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo for Blu-Ray; Dolby Digital Stereo for DVD).  Each film appears as though it has been recently released at the theatre.  There are no vertical lines or dark splotches.  I played the DVD version on my Blu-Ray player and couldn't tell a significant difference from the Blu-Ray.  The remastering for both the Blu-Ray and the DVD has been excellent.  I`ll be able to loan the DVD to my girlfriend, Tammy, who doesn't own a Blu-Ray player.  A horror buff like me, she's going to kill me with her evil thoughts when she learns I watched these films without her.

  Both Scanners II and III were directed by Christian Duguay.  Like ""Scanners,"" they boast gorgeous casts, contain themes of good versus evil and were filmed in and around the cold, gray environs of Montreal and Quebec, Canada.  In ""Scanners II: The New Order,"" a veterinarian student, David Kellum (David Hewitt) is a scanner on the run who finds another scanner, Julie Vale (Deborah Raffin); together they try to destroy the corrupt Commander John Forrester (Yvan Potton) who is using scanners to kill anyone who stands in his way of becoming mayor.  Similar in plot to the original ""Scanners,"" it has, however, some shocking twists.  Also, it has considerably more gore and violence than the original.  This one was more emotionally disturbing to me because it deals more with violence perpetrated against family members.

  In ""Scanners III: The Takeover,"" a Christmas tragedy causes a scanner, Alex Monet (Steve Parrish), to become a monk in Thailand.  Meanwhile, his sister, Helena (Liliana Komorowska), also a scanner, is suffering from severe migraine.  She uses her father's experimental drug and becomes insanely diabolical.  She then commandeers her father's pharmaceutical company to take over the world.  As in the previous film, there is a tremendous amount of violence and gore.  Again, there is familial violence; this time, it is even sadder when relatives attempt to kill one another.  Note: I loved the unforgettable character of Helena.  She is extremely diabolical, beautiful and sensual.  Komorowska played her perfectly.

  There are two discs in this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  One disc contains both films on DVD and the other disc contains both films on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, the combo pack doesn't have any extras.  There are no subtitles, no audio commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no deleted scenes, no ""making off featurettes,"" and, worst of all, no scene selections.  The menu gives you a choice of which Scanners movie to watch and that is all.  Unbelievable!  If not for the widescreen presentations, stereo audio and remastering, I would have thought that these two films had been released by Mill Creek, which churns out films on Blu-Ray and DVD at a high rate, regardless of quality.  Because of its blatant lack of extras, I cannot give this Scanners II and III Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack the highest rating.

  If you are a fan of horror films, especially the ones involving telekinesis, then I recommend this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  However, I wish Shout Factory had either included a digital copy or just decreased the price and given us the choice of buying the Blu-Ray or the DVD, not both.  I also wish that Shout Factory or another company would properly release ""Scanner Cop"" and ""Scanner Cop 2: Volkin's Revenge"" on Blu-Ray.  Both films star Daniel Quinn as Detective Samuel Staziak who hunts down rogue scanners.  The original ""Scanners,"" released by MGM and out of print at the time of this review, also deserves the Blu-Ray treatment.  Many fans are hoping it will be re-released by the Criterion Collection.  My MGM release of ""Scanners"" only has a theatrical trailer and subtitles for extras.  A commentary from David Cronenberg would be nice.

4262658,1,B0009S9LQC,"These movies were fine when they came out in the early 90's. I already own these on VHS. I had this pre-ordered for a while. I started the Blu-ray disc and let me say the quality is not good, worst BD I have seen. Looks like they just took the VHS tapes copied them to Blu-ray and called them Blu-ray when there not. The introduction credits bounce up and down a little (was a tracking issue for VHS tapes). They only have 2-channel audio no 5.1 or 7.1. I hate to see what the DVD disc looks like since they have crammed 2 movies to one disc. I have seen DVD movies that have better quality than this. I know Shout Factory is a low budget studio but they could have done a way better job than this, especially when they are going to sell this as Blu-ray. I would not recommend these to anyone. To me if you have the VHS tapes don't waste your money on this set because you're going to get the same video & audio quality!",1379289600,3,920,4.088397790055248

4262661,5,B0009S9LQC,"the nineties were a period devoid of many sci-fi/horror releases and these two from Canada are a welcome addition to my collection. Having just bought the Criterion edition of Scanners I spent an allnighter watching  these back to back. Despite a lack of special features the film quality was excellent and the story, where the  next generation of scanners are now being exploited and medicated by corrupt police; with the resulting exploding heads and desiccated bad scanner finale in part 2 - the new order. In part 3 the takeover -  a brother and sister team take very different paths- one seeking enlightenment , the other power (from a new drug)  . the resulting clash of ideologies is worth the often poor acting and judicious editing. Overall an interesting take on the conficting world views. Again the special effects are not up to dick smith's quality but still shocking and in keeping with the revenge  theme. Again no special features.",1429920000,,947,4.89375
4262662,4,B0009S9LQC,"First off, the source material for these films was very low quality and, from what I see here, Scream Factory did a fine job of sharpening the image and correcting for color issues. That having been said, this is not the highest quality Blu-ray you will ever own and you should know what you are getting. Second, Scanners III received an independent release where Scanners II did not. As such, in America, this is your only Blu-ray option for Scanners II. Having said that, this is a quality 50 GB disc with each film taking up a fair share of their respective 25 GB, a size we often see very high quality transfers compressed onto so, in my opinion, the picture was good with minimal compression artifacts and, overall, it was certainly an improvement over what I had before. Third, these films are available on Blu-ray from other countries. So, if you love them, you may wish to research the other editions before you decide which version (with which type of color correction, etc.) you prefer, based on your taste. I find this a charming release and am pleased to have it in my collection.

Good luck making your choice.",1429660800,3,1123,4.615

8416594,3,B0009S9LQC,"As a big fan of the first film, I was glad to be able to get these two sequels together. Quite honestly, I wasn't expecting much out of either of these films, but it was nice to have for my collection. First off, we have Scanners II, and I have to say I was surprised on how good it was. Of course, it doesn't reach the heights of the first film, but I felt that it was a very solid sequel. The story was interesting, the acting was okay (except perhaps the Drak character which was pretty over the top), and the special effects were pretty solid. Again, maybe it was just my lower expectations, but I think Scanners II is a decently made film overall. As for Scanners III, I can't really say the same. It seems to be even more cheaply made than Scanners II, with some not so great acting performances. The special effects are okay I guess, but nothing too impressive. Initially, the movie seems to have some promise, but the longer the film goes, the sillier it gets. The ""fights"" between the scanners and action sequences are pretty laughable. Some characters are over the top, most notably the main villain. This sequel is definitely in B-movie territory, and there's really nothing here worth viewing more than once, if that. Again, its nice to have these two films together and at a decent price, but Scanners II is definitely the main reason for owning this.",1499212800,,1364,4.481927710843373

8416597,4,B0009S9LQC,"Having the two so-called sequels to Scanners on one Blu-ray disk is a mixed blessing.  However convenient this might be for collectors of the series, neither movie is that exceptional.
The first movie (Scanners II: the New Order) puts forth a flimsy continuation of the first film with a loose connection to the two main characters in that film.  It involves a veterinarian student (David Hewlett as David Kellum) discovering that he has mental abilities.  This rube hasn't a clue and quickly falls in with a bad lot.  A police commander with designs on taking over the world pretends to be his mentor, encouraging the dolt to do his bidding.  The commander already has a psychotic scanner (Raoul Trujillo as Drak) working for him, but he isn't as presentable in public (due to his predilection for wild eyes, a crazy laugh, and a wacky-toothy grin).  A conspiracy of sorts takes place when the police commander has the the Chief of Police then the mayor shot.  Baby steps, cant takeover the world all at once!

Scanners III is extremely cartoony.  The silly villain, Helena Monet (Liliana Komorrowska), also wants to takeover the world (who doesnt).  She starts killing everyone she can.  She wants control of her fathers company and the drug Eph3 that he created so she kills him.  Naturally she doesnt worry about his secret formula until after she kills him.  Just because you're psychotic doesnt mean you're also intelligent.  While shes at it she tries to kill her brother, using dimwitted scanner/test patients to do her dirty work for her.  Just because you're psychotic doesnt mean you're also competent.
The scanner duels are hilarious.  Everyone twists their head around making ugly faces.  Lots of heads explode.....and one poor pigeon.  It isn't art but it is fun.",1485648000,,1777,4.925925925925926

I was pleased to be able to see the SCANNERS II movie and enjoyed it a lot. I was also happy to see the SCANNERS III movie that came with the set and I enjoyed that film as well. Even though I don't use the BLU-RAY discs at this time, they are nice to have whenever I get a chance to buy a BLU-RAY player.",1454198400,,640,3.748148148148148

8416600,5,B0009S9LQC,"I picked up the original ""Scanners"" Criterion Blu-Ray at Barnes & Noble a few days before I got this and I really liked it. I'd never seen it before but as soon as I watched the original Cronenberg film I saw the Burroughsian influence of the ""Senders"" from ""Naked Lunch"" and the familiar feeling of paranoia and conspiracy you'd find in a William Burroughs novel brought to screen. The sets and direction of the original 1980 movie are fantastic and I absolutely adored the film.

So naturally, I was curious about the sequels, and this Blu-Ray set from Scream! Factory is pretty cheap for two movies plus a DVD of both, included (if you want to watch it at a friend's house and they don't have a Blu-Ray player or something). As some other reviewers have said there are no special features whatsoever, not even trailers, which is a little disheartening because the second movie ""Scanners II: The New Order,"" is not a bad movie at all. It picks up some twenty years after the original and is about a new generation of scanners who are being hired to change the course of government in the city (which is never named) but of course there's drama and turmoil along the way.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed ""Scanners 2,"" I probably enjoyed it way more than I should have. The cinematography is similar to Raimi's chaotic camera techniques employed in ""Evil Dead 2"" and it has a far more fast-paced feel than the first movie in the ""Scanners"" trilogy, but it doesn't subvert the oddities of the original-- at least, I didn't feel like it did. There's a bit of a plot twist maybe two thirds of the way through that links the second movie to the first which most will pick up on but some (including those who haven't seen the original movie) won't, and even if you don't, ""Scanners 2"" works fine as a standalone film. The new bad guy, Drak, is similar to Michael Ironside's character, Revok, from the original, but he's less refined with his powers and more abrasive in his use of them, making him almost as dangerous as Revok. The hero is played by an actor from one of the ""Stargate"" TV shows and I felt he did a great job in the part of Kellum, who has a very memorable scene in a convenience store early in the movie.

I also liked that the opening scene of ""Scanners 2"" paralleled the opening of the original, but inverting the type of character we're following at first throwing us a misdirection. All in all, I was very happy with ""Scanners 2"" and I'd highly recommend it to any fan of the original 1980 David Cronenberg movie!

So then I watched ""Scanners 3: The Takeover.""

It's pretty bad, it's like the kind of movie you'd see featured on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" The same director as ""Scanners II: The New Order"" returns to direct this third part, which is widely unrelated to the original and its first successor. For reasons beyond my understanding, many of the characters, whom I'm assuming are either supposed to be from the Midwestern United States (Detroit area, I'm guessing) or Toronto, Canada speak with European accents. It's kind of funny to watch, because they seem so out of place in the movie and it's any character that will start speaking with a Polish or Norwegian accent for reasons that are not explained in the movie and left completely ignored.

""Scanners 3"" is about a new version of the drug from the original movie, Ephemoral, which helps scanners deal with the constant headaches and anxiety they are born into. Unfortunately it seems to take away their sense of right and wrong, or rather just their sense of right. The villain is a scanner woman who runs the company and is getting high on her own supply and the hero is her brother who's become a Buddhist and lives in a monastery in Thailand where he meditates day and night to block the scanner-related pain he has to deal with. This third part ties in loosely to the first two films, but maybe too loosely. The wacky cinematography is back, and that's fun, but the script is just so downplayed and in comparison to the first films it seems cartoony and immature. While the second movie had a cartoonish element to it, the third movie drinks the Kool-Aid and goes off the wall with goofy sound effects, bad dubbing (some of the characters are dubbed, I don't know why) and poor dialogue and writing that left me feeling kind of empty. It's a dumb but harmless movie and it's fun to watch if you have nothing better to do or are just curious about the scanners.

The major downside to the Blu-Ray and DVD combo is that neither of them have subtitles, I'm a bit hard of hearing and sometimes the characters mumble their lines and I had to turn the volume way up to hear what they were softspokenly saying.

So, all in all, I give this Blu-Ray set five stars ultimately for ""Scanners 2,"" which outweighs the underwhelming ""Scanners 3."" There's no reason not to buy it if you're a fan of the first or second movie. And if you really liked the third one, well, it's all presented here in stunning HD, so go check it out!",1438300800,4,5013,4.513215859030837
