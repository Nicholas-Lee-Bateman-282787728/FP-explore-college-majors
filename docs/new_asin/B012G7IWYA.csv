7351018,5,B012G7IWYA,"I love this movie. Amazing performances by David Oyelowo and Kate Mara. This event captured the attention of the whole country 10 years ago and the movie was very authentic. I hope more movies like this get made, that have honest faith but are totally realistic .",1450569600,2,263,4.617021276595745
7351019,5,B012G7IWYA,"David Oyelowo and Kate Mara enact an extremely powerful suspense story of redemption. In Atlanta, Georgia in 2005, a convict named Brian Nichols escaped and committed acts of murder in the process. He made his new hiding place the home of Ashley Smith, a single mother who couldn't even have custody of her daughter because she was addicted to meth. She had been given a copy of The Purpose Driven Life, which has become a household name because it's one of the most popular Christian books ever, but was not very motivated to read it. Indeed, when this story hit the news, it became a major boost for the book's success. After undergoing seven hours of captivity by Brian Nichols, Ashley finally experienced a miracle: He allowed her to read the book aloud, she turned to chapter 32 and read it aloud, and it softened his spirit. She was able to get her freedom.

The movie's cinematography/camerawork is very good. The acting by David Oyelowo is truly Oscar-worthy. That actor carries a strong presence, and it's quite an achievement that he was able to play such a fully believable criminal, who is tormented inside, ruthless, but also hesitant to kill people who haven't provoked him. He played the pacifist Martin Luther King in the movie Selma just last year! I was reminded of Captain Phillips (2013 movie starring Tom Hanks) when I saw how he kept having to threaten her in his desperation for leverage against the government, fearing they would not let him see his son in prison if he turned himself in. I find it sad that to this day, Ashley has not been able to reconnect with Brian Nichols as he's in prison, nor can his son meet him until he turns 18. Somehow, though, even though it's definitely bittersweet, the mood that the movie captures at the end is gladness at how Ashley gained victory over her sin issue of drug addiction, and that she's doing well and ministering to other addicts now. But this movie also has entertainment value as a suspense thriller with extraordinary acting.",1446854400,21,2003,4.706552706552706
7351020,2,B012G7IWYA,"This is the true story of ""courage"" of drug addict Ashley Smith (Kate Mara) whose home was invaded by Brian Nichols (David Oyelowo) a rather polite cop killer who had escaped from Fulton Co. jail. Ashley reads to him a couple of lines from ""A Purpose Driven Life"" and he allows her to leave and then gives himself up to the cops. That is pretty much it. Ashley had ample opportunity to escape at numerous other occasions and chose not to do so, as many people speculated the two people had known each other, i.e. drug dealings previously. In this version of the story they are complete strangers. The film gets preachy during the epilogue, but wasn't too bad during the film. Unfortunately this was basically a two man play with boring characters and dialogue.

The film is liked by those who enjoy faith based films.

7351021,5,B012G7IWYA,"I just came from seeing this movie in a theater, and want to pre-order a copy to watch again and share with others.  I went to the movie to see what happened when a young woman (actually, based on a true story) got kidnapped by a murderer and God showed up.  I was AMAZED!  Ashley Smith's life was going down the tubes, and God stepped in.  This movie doesn't preach.  It shows courage and offers hope.  See it!

7351023,3,B012G7IWYA,"Based on a true story: David plays the escaped convict, rapist in denial, then courthouse murderer, who breaks into Kate's house for his hideout. She is a struggling addict, with a child to visit acc. to schedule, and now she has two major struggles to contend with.

Prior to the takeover, she is given THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE book after a therapy session, which she discards. The book finds its way to her food service job site...and she takes interest.

She and her kidnapper settle into a kind of routine where she reads to him from the book. Will these words make a difference..in *both* of their l;ives? Will she stay off drugs? Will he turn himself in? see the film!

ONE STAR is removed for two reasons: as strong as the direction is, we do not see any kind of ""transformation"" in the behavior of the two, no subtle sign that something good has penetrated their sweaty epidermis. Then just when we are satisfied that, well, the religious tome could not have *hurt*, we see a TV clip of Oprah welcoming Pastor Rick Warren on her show, who says his book is about
hope""...hope if you believe in God? if you read the Bible? apparently not!..just read my best seller! So we walk down the theatre aisle wondering if all along this should have been great movie was hijacked by a snake oil salesman and transformed into just publishing exploitation. (I guess the four Court workers did not buy their copy).",1442793600,2,1406,4.571428571428571
7351024,2,B012G7IWYA,"I'm not sure why the caption under the movie reads based on the inspiring true story. There was very little in this movie to inspire anyone. I'm glad this woman made it out alive and the man was captured, but the movie failed to show the reasons he spared her or what she did to inspire him not to. I thought perhaps during her ordeal she would have spoken words of faith to him, said something to awaken him, confronted him or otherwise faced down the demons within him. Perhaps she did but the film doesn't show it. I kept waiting for something inspiring to happen. It never did. Instead, she said little and it was just a long drawn out waiting game as to what he was going to do to escape or possibly kill her too. The inclusion of the book, ""The Purpose Driven Life"" was unnecessary to the story as she didn't read it or understand it and simply used it as a distraction for the killer. The fact she got sober because of this is the best part of the story. I feel the suspect came to realize he was on the wrong path on his own without her input. Perhaps the birth of his son was what inspired him, but we are left with many unanswered questions. With so much suffering going on in the world, I didn't find this movie to be inspiring at all but rather indulging the author and woman at the center of the story. If you are looking for inspiration, skip this movie.",1507075200,2,1368,4.20532319391635

I was surprised that the book ""The Purpose Driven Life"" didn't have more or a center stage in the movie, since (from what I understand of the actual events) reading this was likely the pivotal event in the way this situation turned out.  I am a huge Kata Mara fan, though, and thought she did her usual terrific job.  David Oyelowo managed to be a sympathetic character, at least to me, even during threatening behaviors.  It was obvious he did indeed have a demon inside of him, and really seemed to be fighting it.  Thumbs up from me, and I'd recommend it.",1476662400,2,581,4.443396226415095

7351406,3,B012G7IWYA,"The only thing that makes this worth watching is that it was based upon real events that save the real life Ashley Smith out of an addiction to crystal meth. The convict-on-the-run story was weak compared to similar films but improves when escapee Brian Nichols takes Smith hostage in her apartment.

This should have been a better movie. It seems that the producer/director team wanted more to stay true to the real events than telling a compelling story. A story that did emerge in the final moments of the film with archival footage of the real Smith telling her story to television news and talk show hosts. Seeing that indicates that the real story was likely more compelling that what emerged in the film.",1476576000,,711,4.733870967741935

7351606,5,B012G7IWYA,"Captive is a really good thriller.  It's about a man who escapes from prison (played by David Oyelowo), ends up killing several people along the way (including a judge since apparently the court room is in the same building).  *facepalm* Oh it's called a courthouse jail!  I've never seen one of those before.  And basically doesn't care about anything (except for his baby son) which makes him super dangerous.

Anyway after breaking out and causing trouble (including secretly visiting his baby son and ex-wife without the wife knowing he's standing right outside her screen door despite the fact the woman should clearly be able to see him from that view) well, more unintentional writing flaws occur, and somehow he goes undetected by the cops when they pull up to the woman's front yard.  What?  He was in plain view!  How could the cops not see him standing by the front door!  And when David runs across the street and hides behind a bush... how did he make it across without the cops seeing him?  Okay all kinds of storyline flaws, haha.

But anyway, who cares.  Later David finds himself driving around late at night... which happens to be the same time a meth recovery addict (Kate Maya) is outside.  Knowing something is wrong with the vehicle she sees parking close by her house, she tries to quickly run inside and hide but is unsuccessful- the man is already at her front door and forces himself inside.

While you might be quick to think the acting and the storyline isn't up to par, you should know this is based on a true story so that REALLY changes things for me.  Now I'm more forgiving of the story at least, though most of the acting is good enough.  David tries to make Kate believe he's not as dangerous as she thinks, but well, when you leave a trail of destruction and receive all kinds of attention on the evening news, it's sort of hard to think you're a nice guy!  Not that she's aware of the death right away- after all she has no idea who this man is, but she figures it out soon enough.

David does all the typical stuff a murderer on the run would do- he ties up Kate (a couple different times- and in one way makes Kate think he's going to rape her).  He searches for food and drinks (since all that running from the cops sure can work up an appetite!) and he even takes a shower while placing a towel over Kate's head as she's tied up and sits close by (no looking!)  Of course the movie soon uses the ol ""Please excuse me, I have to use the bathroom but the door needs to be closed because I can't go with you looking"" type of moment.  This was obviously done for Kate to give herself some crucial alone time to try and open that barely-budgeable bathroom window.  We're on to you Kate!  Too bad it wouldn't open.

David's the kind of murderer who's not only out for revenge against the people who did him wrong (he doesn't like the idea of being locked away in jail that's for sure) and he's willing to kill anyone who stands in his way.  For example when David and Kate come up with this idea to ditch the vehicle David stole because the police are now aware of the license plate number, well unfortunately for everyone Kate has car trouble (yeah, sort of a cliche, but read on) so when David follows behind Kate after David realizes there's woods close to Kate's house for him to ditch the vehicle (another flaw- the vehicle was never taken to the woods and instead was left in the open) guess what happens at the traffic light?  Darn car stops running!  And in the pouring down rain too since that's how it always goes.  But Kate has a plan.  That is to open the lid and pour gatorade on the car parts (at least it looks like a green bottle of gatorade- maybe it's something else).

As fate would have it, a man in a van pulls up to this vehicle and asks Kate if she needs help.  Realizing David's in the car behind him, the man often turns around to keep an eye on the suspicious man in that vehicle.  David doesn't say a word which raises suspicion.  This man doesn't know how lucky he is to be alive!  When David and Kate return home David's not nearly as violent as he was earlier.  Perhaps that story Kate shared about how she lost her husband to a drug dealer is the reason why.

David allows Kate to read lines from a book that was given to Kate by a woman at the drug recovery center (good thing Kate didn't reject that book the second time!) and it's also a good thing -perhaps a life saving thing- that the book mentions being saved by God for one's sins, because this sure came in handy later!  Then again David sort of brushed off these meaningful words and mentioned how his own father- an alcoholic, never changed despite his belief in God.  My favorite scene is when Kate stands up for herself and demands she will not be forced to use meth even though David's threatening her.  He gets quiet and backs away just enough to make you think he's going to kill her, but instead walks in the other room resulting in nothing happening to Kate.  Creepy moment there!  I almost want to joke that it takes something like THIS to get Kate to realize doing drugs is wrong but being based on a true story, I won't.

This is a SPOILER, but I'm totally amazed David lets Kate go.  I think many of us were convinced he was going to let Kate walk to the front door then jump up off the floor and slam it shut, forcing her to stay inside and cause more emotional trauma.  But no!  Meanwhile Michael K. Williams is the local cop who's determined to bring David down.  Odd when Michael calls Kate a snitch.  Bad word to use given everything that's going on with David being trapped inside and the cops trying to lure him out, unless I misunderstood and the word isn't really as negative as I thought.  It makes me wonder what would've happened had David went through with his plan to pick up Kate's baby daughter and the three ended up travelling to Mexico.  This was David's plan before ditching the vehicle.

Captive really has no flaws to speak of, unless you expected an extra 20 minutes overall (which would have been nice admittedly because it probably would have made the story even better) and perhaps the tone overall was a bit too quiet and nonchalant considering this was based on a real story, but these are really minor complaints.  The talk show segment at the end with the REAL Kate explaining her very real story on Oprah is a nice touch, while also recognizing those who were killed along the way.  Recommended for all movie lovers.",1467504000,,6485,4.384100418410042

7351620,2,B012G7IWYA,"Watched ""Captive"" starring David Oyelowo (I had to look that up) and...I guess secular companies can't write a decent faith based movie either. Might have something to do with the story almost precisely following the usual formula of said faith films, with book tie ins and what have you, even though this was based on true events.  But that certainly doesn't mean it's very good.

 Good acting, decent directing, OK script, HORRIBLE ending. Because this wasn't a movie. It really happened. And it didn't have a movie worthy ending. This wasn't movie material, it was a dramatized documentary of a true life event with tragic real world consequences, with a closing scene so slimy and out of place it might as well have had a flashing sign saying ""Buy my book and watch Oprah.""

7351803,5,B012G7IWYA,"I'm glad this film is finally out on DVD. Even though it was distributed by Paramount Pictures, it wasn't widely shown in theaters. Perhaps the reasoning is the idea that faith films are not compelling enough to fill more theater seats. My posture while viewing this film? Captiveliterally. Held taut for 136 intense minutes and forgetting to exhale.

""Captive"" is based on the true story of Ashley Smith, a single mother struggling with drug addiction, taken hostage in her apartment by a man on the run after breaking out of jail and murdering the judge assigned to his case. We are first introduced to Ashley (Kate Mara) in an addiction recovery group. Ashley pulls no punches about what drugs have cost her. She has a daughter she adores, but drug use has taken away what is most precious to her. No, next to most precious: she admits she cant stop using because she likes it too much. We study her transparent expression as her resigned words replay in our ears, and we decide in that moment to applaud her honesty. We sympathize. When help is offered in the form of a book, The Purpose Driven Life, she tosses it in the trash. She is ruining her life and cant stop. Wont stop. What good can a book do? She is honest, she is helpless, and she is hopeless.

Soon, through a violent chain of events, escaped killer Brian Nichols (David Oyelowo), takes Ashley hostage in her apartment. Desperate and hunted, he also pulls no punches about what he is capable of. He killed a judge who wanted to enslave him, and it felt good. Ashleys already hopeless life takes a sudden and unexpected turn for the worse.

Two lives intersect and the course of each changes in a most unusual and unnatural way. Its that unnatural element that often piques my interest. The book Ashley tossed into the trash ends up on her kitchen table and becomes a catalyst of hope.

Real flaws, mistakes, and wounds, basic human hopes and fears bring stories to life, make them tangible, meaningful. And high on my list are stories that include a real God who touches real lives in a very real and often unnatural way. It is the supernatural, subtly portrayed in this film, which adds that spark, that tangible hope to Ashleys story. It is done carefully and organically, not forced, not tidy.

Like life.

The story is well-written, touching on universal elements of human experience people feel and even crave, like hope, second chances, and spiritual truths that empower and liberate. The acting is superb. Mara and Oyelowo are spell-binding as they portray realistic, complex characters who grip us from beginning credits to end.

""Captive"" is a high quality, thought provoking, captivating film that lingers long after you see it.

7351809,5,B012G7IWYA,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I started Captive. I mean, I do remember hearing about this when it happened but a 30 second news blip doesn't even begin to cover the story. What I watched was a moving and powerful story about a woman with train-wrecked life who comes to a crossroads when the unthinkable happens.

Dramatic, nail-biting. The acting is just so good that I could feel the anger and the fear rolling off the screen. One of the things that really stood out to me in this movie is the power of the written and spoken word. It is Ashley's giving voice to the words of the book that makes the difference, not only to Brian Nichols but also to Ashley herself.

Captive is a gritty and inspiring film. One that would actually be a great movie for parents and older teens to watch together. And you won't soon forget...

We all have a purpose and we all have choices...

7351847,4,B012G7IWYA,"Having seen both the movie and the book, my preference leans strongly toward the movie.  The performances by Kate Mara as Ashley, and David Oyelowo as Brian, are superb. Considering that the story relies heavily on scenes that only include those two, it was imperative that they stay true to character. Oyelowo was entirely convincing as Nichols; his spiritual torment was vividly portrayed. I cannot say enough about the way these actors shined.  Side characters, including Michael K. Williams as the detective, provided excellent support as the story unfolded.  Even though I knew the outcome of the story, I sat spellbound as I tried to fight the fear that bubbled inside.  Although faith was a strong point in the book, it took a back burner in the movie.  At the end of the movie, we get to see some clips of the real Ashley, and find out what happened to the characters. It was a great way to wrap things up.  The movie has some violent scenes, and drug related content.  Because of this, it has a rating of PG-13.  Our 11-year-old daughter watched the movie with us, and it gave us a good opportunity to talk about the dangers of drug use.  I wouldnt hesitate to show this to teens.  I wouldnt, however, allow our 6 year old to watch it.  Captive has a profound message - God can use anyone to do good works, and He can forgive anyone, too.  I received this movie to review. Opinions shared are mine.",1453507200,4,1407,4.5396825396825395
7351848,4,B012G7IWYA,"Captive is based on a true event that I remember following on television, plus I read the book both when it was originally published and again a few months ago. That is part of the problem for me. On one hand, there were very strong performances, especially by the 2 leads, David Oyelowo and Kate Mara. They were both believable in their roles and kept my attention.

However, the story-telling was a bit shallow and weak. I understand that there is a need to get into the back story and condense 7 hours into a 96 minute film, but too much time was spent on fictionalized sections that I felt took away from the actual events. And it was the fictionalized (or altered) scenes that would cause my eyes to roll a bit. This is a powerful, captivating, story that stands up based on its own merit. There also seemed as though there was a reluctance to incorporate much of the faith aspect, including The Purpose Driven Life, perhaps to entice a larger audience, but the growing faith of Ashley has always been a key part of the story and had to be shown. Don't get me wrong; it was only part of the story and did not need to be over-exaggerated either. There was something in the book that always resonated with me which was used in another part of the film, but was trivialized when moved.

So, because of the performances, I would give it a high score. The film story puts it down to an average rating, but I am going to take into consideration that I am biased in favor of the actual events and tend to be a stickler about sticking to facts as much as possible. To be fair, I have loved other movies that I later found out could barely claim ""based on a true story"" and they honestly did not stray that far in this movie. So, I will give it 4 stars.

7351860,4,B012G7IWYA,"I am not a huge fan of the Rick Warren book mentioned in the movie, so I really had no plans to watch it until I received a review opportunity for it and read about the movie.... so I figured I might as well do it.

  The movie doesn't sugarcoat anything. The main character is a drug addict who has had her little girl taken from her, and she is still doing drugs. There is also gun violence in the movie as it shows the bad guy shooting and killing a few people. Other than those two issues, the movie is clean and curse-free.

  Captive does a great job of showing a young woman down on her luck whose life is suddenly turned more upside down as she becomes the captive of a man on the run for murder. The acting is top notch, and the movie producers did a great job of making a movie length story about these true events.

  The book plays a rather small part in the movie, but it does seem to help soften the criminal to bring about the ending that happens instead of one that could have ended in tragedy. The movie shows that good can come out of even an event such as this young woman went through.

7351865,4,B012G7IWYA,"This is the first I've heard of Captive and after watching it I can't believe there's not more hype out there about it! Just watching the trailer gave me chills. You can view it here.

I'm a fan of Kata Mara so I was really looking forward to seeing her performance. I find her so relatable and believable and she did not disappoint. As a single mom fighting for her daughter and to get her life back on track, Ashley Smith already has enough problems. Now they are compounded by a criminal's actions when Brian Nichols breaks in and takes her hostage.

This movie has an undertone of constant suspense without being overly dramatic. I think the complexity of the characters coupled with the action makes it very intense.

When someone gives Ashley a copy of the book The Purpose Driven Life, she has no intention of reading it. But what else does one do when held hostage? It could be the one thing that ends up changing both their lives at pivotal moments.

What I really liked about this movie is that it wasn't predictable. It was a great reminder that all of us are sinners and while I found myself somewhat rooting for Nichols to change his life, I couldn't very well support a murderer. This brought out in me all kinds of questions and issues about forgiveness and sinners. It made him a very interesting character to be a criminal, yet somewhat lik-eable at the same time. It's a reminder that we are all human with shortcomings, some just much larger than others!

The ending seemed a bit anti climatic to me but then it was based on a true story so I also appreciate that they didn't embelish and just kept it real.

Captive was a great movie about hope and forgiveness and proved to be much more entertaining than I anticipated with action and suspense. It really had it all.

7351866,5,B012G7IWYA,"Captive is a compelling true story about a young widow (Ashley Smith)  held by her own prison of drugs and the loss of being the mother to her little girl and Brian Nichols, a man accused of rape and an escaped prisoner with 4 murders in his wake.  These two are thrown together in a thriller drama that shows the power of redemption.

One rainy night in Atlanta, GA, Brian Nichols grabs Ashley Smith outside of her apartment and holds her hostage for 7 hours.  In that time he takes the drugs she still has in her new apartment but she refuses.  She calmly tries to talk to him and eventually she ends up reading parts of the book The Purpose Driven Life to him.  They are two desperate people and Ashley saw how broken Brian was and he saw the hope that she had within her.  Both were imprisoned by their choices, yet, God chose to redeem them in miraculous ways.

Ashley believes that God saved her that night in March 2005 and she has been drug free since.  Brian Nichols surrendered to the police without a fight and now is in prison for life without parole.  Both realized that light can shine through the darkness and this movie showed just how messy lives can be, but how no one is too far away from the God who saves.

I really enjoyed this movie. It was powerful and thought provoking how God can use such broken people to come to him.  Although Brian is not ""saved"" he surrenders to the police which ultimately ends his flight peacefully.  There are a few drug scenes and some violence with gun shots and punching, but this drama was also full of hope and humanity that we all face things that imprison us and God can use any circumstance to bring us out of that pit.  This true story is worth watching.",1453248000,,1714,4.332288401253918

7351868,4,B012G7IWYA,"This story is based on a true story and I love movies like that.  I had no clue what this movie was about before I watched it.  It was very well made and the acting was great.  I can't get enough of Kate Mara.  It started off with Kate Mara (as Ashley) being a recovering drug addict.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, it is so common to know someone like that.  You see all the reality drug shows and you see how it affects people and our nation (not to mention the world).  I knew a guy who was a recovering alcoholic (and whose brother was as well) and so I could somewhat relate to the world she was in.  She just couldn't get it together and it is sad.  But it is reality for so many people.  There is a darkness there.  And the other character, Brian Nichols, is in the darkness as well.  He goes on a violent crime spree which was hard to watch at times but it is reality and it is happening all over the United States.  And these two people somehow end up saving each other in the end.

I do feel like the characters' life stories weren't touched upon enough for me to really feel empathy or sympathy for either of them.  I wish they would have emphasized it more.  So if you watch the movie, pay attention when they talk about the characters' pasts - things that might have brought them to where they are today.  Another thing, when the character Ashley doesn't do something (won't give it away), I didn't really understand it until I watched the 'Extras' on the DVD so I recommend you watch the 'Extras' for a deeper connection to the story.  Also, I would have liked if they would have delved more into the book than they did or even bring up God more.

 Having said that, the movie is well made, the acting is great, and the movie is based on a true story. I definitely recommend watching it.",1453161600,,1807,4.1976744186046515

7351893,4,B012G7IWYA,"This movie was a lot different than I expected. I am a believer, a struggling believer more, someone who really wants to believe but just can't get over that mountain. I look to movies and music sometimes to help me with my beliefs. Movies life God's Not Dead and Heaven is for Real as examples. I was expecting this to be another movie of that nature. A movie with a strong Christian message that tries to make it as a mainstream movie. That is not the case.

This movie is based on a true story about a man attempting to escape from his destiny of a life in prison. There is some violence and action scenes at the beginning of the movie during his escape, but the majority of this movie is based on the time spent at the apartment with a young woman held against her will.

This movie was promoted around Rick Warren's book ""The Purpose Driven Life', however, you will find the movie does not play out as the trailers would lead you to believe. For me, I struggled with this fact. Part of me enjoyed that the movie did not play out as my preconceived thoughts had it, however, when the movie ended, I couldn't help but feel like something was missing.

I do believe that there was opportunities to make this story deeper, to make the characters more vulnerable, and to dive deeper into the relationship between the two main characters. With that being said, I don't believe that most choosing to watch this movie are looking for that, more for the usage to Warren's book and the message they hope this movie will deliver. The unfortunate part is that this movie fails to go truly in depth in this aspect either, as the usage of the book seems as though it is an afterthought and not one of the main focal points as the trailers would lead you to believe.

With that being said, overall, I did enjoy this movie. I think that this movie was made in a fashion that both those expecting a Christian movie and those coming in not knowing the backstory, looking for a thriller, will also be entertained. I think this is a worthy watch, and you will not be disappointed in taking the time to watch this movie. Just make sure you come in with the right expectations.",1453161600,,2160,4.3925
7351894,4,B012G7IWYA,"Its encouraging that Hollywood is getting behind the recent (and by recent I mean probably in the last three or four years) wave of movies with a message of hope and healing. A message about God. The quite, assuming success of the small films like Facing the Giants and Fireproof, even actors have gotten behind the push for movies with a message.

In Captive (based on a true story), single mother and widow Ashley Smith (Kate Mara, House of Cards, The Fantastic Four) is struggling to get her life back in order. Her addiction to meth has separated her from her own daughter. While she wants to get her life back on track, to get custody of her little girl back, but the draw of drugs is too tempting.

One evening, she is taken hostage in her own apartment by Brian Nichols (David Oyelowo, Selma, Interstellar), a man who has escaped policy custody and killed four people as he has fled across the city of Atlanta, GA in order to see his newborn child. While he seems like a cold-blooded killer, a criminal who should get what he deserves, hes also hesitant to do harm to those how haven't provoked him, those who are willing to listen to him, see him as a human being and not an animal.

As Ashley and Brian spend an entire night in her apartment, she turns to Rick Warrens book, A Purpose Driven Life. When Brian asks her to read it out loud, they begin a conversation about God and their lives.

Both Oyelowo and Mara give strong performances in their roles, both believable. You can tell there was some money put into this movie. While some of the sets are simple, the cinematography is spot-on and you feel like you're in that apartment with Ashley.

While this movie has a strong message and is well-done, it is not one for families. There is quite a bit of violence at the beginning and both main characters take drugs at a few points in the film. And while the message of God and hope is implied, the viewers only get to see it lived out in the real-life interview clips inserted within the final credits and the bonus material on the DVD. But for a lost and hurting world, its a place to start.

Based on a miraculous story about the power of faith, Captive is an ""amazing, inspiring"" drama about the spiritual collision of two lost souls, Brian Nichols (Golden Globe Nominee David Oyelowo), on the run from police and desperate to make contact with his newborn son, takes recently widowed mother Ashley Smith (Kata Mara) hostage in her own apartment.  Fearing for her life and desperately hoping to see her daughter again, she turns to Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life for guidance.  Ashley and her captor face a crossroads where they discover hope and light in the midst of despair in the moving film that Dick Rolfe, CEO, Dove Foundation hailed as ""powerful.""

My Review:
 The book The Purpose Driven Life has no doubt touch millions upon millions of people. Captive, is a movie that will take you to the exact place where Brian and Ashley both suffering in their own way with their own set of problems meet face to face. In a very tense situation that could prove to be a matter of life and death.  We are taken on each of the main characters journey one that brings them together while still leaving them miles apart.

 We as human beings can be held hostage by our own thoughts or situations. Many times we don't see any clear way out but a wrong one. The main characters in this film know this all too well when their two lives collide one pretty sunny day. I don't think they knew when they woke up that morning that the two of them would meet or that God would meet them there, as well.

 An amazingly touching movie that can apply to many of us at one point or another!

7351896,4,B012G7IWYA,"I vaguely remember hearing about this story when I was in high school about a man who  escaped just prior to going to court and holding a woman hostage. I also faintly remember references to Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life around the time-- I think the book had been published just a few years prior and was quite popular in Church circles. But so many times, these events drift from our minds unless they immediately impact us.

More recently, I started hearing about the movie Captive and those distant memories came back. Often, the truth can be just as fascinating as fiction, so when an opportunity arose to review this movie I was very interested.

I found Captive to be an interesting view into this event that happened just over a decade ago. The story itself is filled with themes of faith and hope on the part of both characters, Ashley Smith and Brian Nichols. From the little pieces of interviews and such I have recently watched prior to the movie, I judge that the movie does follow the events of Nichols holding Smith quite closely.

The movie was at times intense in the wondering of what would happen next and fast paced, especially early on. There were a few moments where I found things to be a bit slow, but considering the movies short length overall, there were not too many of these moments. Overall, I thought it was a well made movie and my husband and I both enjoyed it. The PG-13 rating seems appropriate considering there are murders involved and drug use. However, neither are drawn out any more than necessary and are in the movie because that is the way that it happened.

7351897,5,B012G7IWYA,"On March 11, 2005, Brian Nichols shot and killed four people in the Atlanta courthouse.  While the entire city of  Atlanta is looking for the escaped killer, Ashley Smith didn't think he would come anywhere near her.  She was wrong and almost paid for that mistake with her life.

This single mom and widow, has been fighting demons of her own in the form of drug addiction.  She was just making strides in getting her life together, when she finds herself being held captive.  The killer that the entire city of Atlanta is looking for has shown up in her small suburb, and is holding her hostage in her new apartment.

Watch this movie to see the exciting true story unfold and learn how Ashley is able to remain alive, and even talk to her hostile captor about God.  Learn how Ashley's life is never the same.  Witness what happens when her captor tells her he doesn't trust her, and she believes she is taking her last breathe here on earth.  You will be riveted by this inspiring and exciting show.

This movie is rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving violence and substance abuse.

7351898,4,B012G7IWYA,"Based on a true story of that gripped the nation back in 2005, and an escaped convict, Brian Nichols held single meth addict mother, Ashley Smith hostage for 7 hours.  What's so amazing about this story was how Brian Nichols ultimately let Ashley go. Divine intervention is all there is. Through reading together a chapter in Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, both Brian and Ashley awakens to God's faith in them, and ultimately what freedom is.

 The movie starts off the murderous action of Brian, and pans to the life of Ashley, struggling with her addiction to meth.  When their two worlds collides, the pace of the movie continues steadily.  The actor who played Brian Nichols, David Oyelowo gave a worthy portrayal of a convict who is lost and needs hope.  His emotions of lost, anger and even fear were well displayed facially.

With this story (the movie and the true story), what I find interesting is how all elements lined up, divinely.  However, the role of the reading of the The Purpose Driven Life is short, almost 3/4 of the way into the movie, which I had hoped for a bigger presence.  The faith element was shown through subtly, and that's the only gripe I have with the movie. I wished for a stronger presence, with no doubt, but then it would be too unbelievable?  Either way, Captive is moving, and demonstrated faith during times of danger and fear. Where there seems to be no hope, God knocks on until you see the light.

7351902,5,B012G7IWYA,"This movie is based on a true story that can be read about in the book Captive:  The Untold Story of the Atlanta Hostage Hero.  In 2005, Ashley Smith and Brian Nichols are about to meet in a dramatic and life- changing way.  Brian Nichols is set to appear in a courtroom to face criminal charges when he accosts the sheriff guarding him, steals her weapon and then proceeds to take the lives of four people and escapes.  Brian then steals various vehicles to avoid capture.  When he captures Ashley outside her apartment, he then proceeds to keep her there with him for hours.  During that time, she reads a book given to her called, The Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren, which originally she had trashed after leaving a meeting for those trying to break free of living on drugs.
I read the book first which helped fill in some of the gaps not shown in the movie.  When seeing the movie, please don't allow young children to watch it due to the violence.  There is a vast difference when I read a book as to see it played out on the screen.  The movie really grabs ones heart and attention, drawing the audience back to a tragic event in 2005.  At the end of the movie, there is a clip of the real Ashley Smith when she appeared on Oprah as well as the sheriff who was beaten.
There is also a memoriam to those who lost their lives that day in court.  I remember this event when it broke on the news, but hearing what went on in the courtroom and then with Ashley really was very moving.  It also reminds us that just because the moment he is captured is over the ripple effect of the aftermath continues today.
Above all, we see Gods hand moving and working on hearts when evil is trying to ruin many lives.  My heart went out to the families who lost a loved one and to Ashley Smith.  It is beyond understanding why Brian chose to commit the actions he carried out.  I pray the families have been able to work through their suffering and see how God is carrying them, loving them and healing them.

Before writing the review let me tell that I was not aware of the true story before hand so I enjoyed the suspense thoroughly. The movie has 2 main characters Ashley (the hostage) and Brian Nichols (the suspect on run) and the acting is awesome from both of them. They successfully generated the underlying emotion of a hostage mother who is supposed to meet her child tomorrow and the suspect who has some good in him. They spent the night of the pursuit together and how the story unfold was very nice and enjoyable. The movie also sends avery strong message of courage. Showing the actual characters at the end of the movie was a plus. Overall I enjoyed every bit of it from the beginning to end.,1452038400,7,756,4.446043165467626
8726136,3,B012G7IWYA,"I thought the movie was well crafted and well acted. Sadly, the ending was fraught with hypocrisy after Ashley offered a human connection to Brian, then turned her back on him. I especially found it heinous that she has never visited him in jail. He was the catalyst who helped her turn her life around. I also felt that the ending was a thinly veiled promotion to purchased ""The Purpose Driven Life."" Cheesy at best; shameless self-promoting at worst.",1531353600,,452,4.734177215189874

I found it to be much like an after-school special. Crappy acting and a fake story line. I would recommend for Christians however if you are not in the Christian mythology I would not recommend this movie.",1508630400,,397,4.685714285714286
