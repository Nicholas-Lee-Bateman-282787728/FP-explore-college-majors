8322753,1,B001N0LEMY,"Let me qualify my review by stating my husband is European and loves quirky, Indy movies. I purchased this as a gift for him as we love (and have) Rhodesian Ridgebacks. I thought to myself, how bad can a short film be? Well, let me tell you. It's a strange story with hammy acting on a low budget. Now the low budget I can deal with, the poor quality of filming, lighting and editing is iffy, the hammy acting, poor screenplay and story line are the clincher for a real stinker of a movie.

Don't wast your money. If you want to buy this, send me a message and I'll sell you my copy!",1396396800,,583,4.114035087719298
8322754,4,B001N0LEMY,"""The writing is creative and natural, far superior to most independent shorts. The Direction was superb, Dan Margules extracted good performances out of his actors and he must have steered his crew well because they did a great job. For a low budget indie production he certainly produced a quality product - well done.""",1240876800,,320,4.944444444444445
