2825674,4,B000PMGHCS,"This is really a good ""exposition"" of the theory and procedures for sextant navigation, if you don't get negatively distrated by Buckley's manner and speech.  Buckley, who is American, was a highly regarded conservative intellectual in the '60s and '70s and popular as a writer and television commentator, in addition to being an avid sailor.  His accent came from learning English in London and then attending New England ivy league prep schools and Yale as a young man.  He was an officer in the U.S. Army and a CIA officer before becoming a noted author and political / social commentator.  People either hate or love his accent and upper class manner, but if you can deal with that you will find a true intellectual who actually thinks his way through to his ideas and is able to present them in a clear, logical way.  That's what I found this video to be best at, a good and thoughtful explanation of the procedures for taking and calculating position from a sun sight.",1405123200,4,974,4.6725146198830405
2825675,3,B000PMGHCS,Kind of boring. Turned of by the pompus British actor. He was very snobosh in the way he spoke to the camera.,1393545600,,109,4.0
2825676,1,B000PMGHCS,"Buckley is so stiff and untelegenic in his leather wing-back chair that it is almost impossible to soak up the content of his lecture. I'm sure that in the mid 80s this video and its ""computer animation"" was cutting edge, but today its production values are laughably quaint. His clenched-jaw Yale voice is so grating that my wife and I turned it off after 5 excruciating minutes. I simply cannot believe that no better source for this information has been produced in the last 20 years. The $30 price tag is insulting.",1252627200,3,519,4.6521739130434785
2825677,3,B000PMGHCS,"Buckley clears up how to take a sight in his wonderful character and makes it seem so simple. Very good on content but had a difficult time finding a way to make it play. Would not work in my DVD player, however, managed to get it to play on my Mac. Was also missing items referred to by Buckley in his presentation (sight taking forms).",1222128000,4,337,4.2
8192568,5,B000PMGHCS,Excellent!!! William Buckley makes Celestial navigation easy. This video is a great starting point for celestial.,1523145600,,113,6.125
8192569,2,B000PMGHCS,"Downloaded the video only to find that, in order to really follow the material, I needed worksheets and reference material that WOULD have been provided had I purchased a DVD!  Recommend you provide a website where these items could be downloaded for free.",1473379200,3,256,4.953488372093023
8192570,5,B000PMGHCS,"Dated but the info hasn't changed at all,  good explanation of how to usa a sextant and what the values mean and how to figure position.",1461715200,,136,4.230769230769231
8192571,5,B000PMGHCS,"Clears up a lot of confusion from the literature and gives a good step to step review of the process. The literature I was studying was ""English"", which could been some of the confusion.",1457740800,,186,4.5
8192572,5,B000PMGHCS,"Like anything else for me it takes watching it over and over, but it is done very well and I would give it a 10",1454544000,,111,3.48
8192573,5,B000PMGHCS,Watched this for a class. Very informative.,1448323200,,43,5.285714285714286
8192574,2,B000PMGHCS,It was really dry and I couldn't finish the video.,1447286400,,50,4.1
8192575,5,B000PMGHCS,"The video shows you how, in only 45 minutes, to use celestial navigation.  No 300 pages of math you don't need, just a simple method to actually use it.  The video is a few years old but, except for the publication of the almanacs,  celestial navigation hasn't changed much in more than 150 years, so it might as well have been made yesterday.",1444435200,,343,4.412698412698413
8192576,5,B000PMGHCS,"It was very informative, I would like to see how well it works. I will definitely watch it again.",1437696000,,97,4.157894736842105
8192577,4,B000PMGHCS,"The presenter's preferred sight reduction method is detailed.  It is quick and to the point with a step-by-step procedure.  Presentation is not cluttered or confused with discussion of other methods or excessive details of the underlying geometry and math.  The presentation is old, but so is the material so that's not an issue.  I found the presenter's style humorous--stilted and stuffy--but not a problem.",1411084800,3,409,5.34375
