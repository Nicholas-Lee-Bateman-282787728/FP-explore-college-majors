8518654,3,B007K7IASU,"Unfortunately, I read the novels first.  This made all the Sharpe Series movies disappointing.  Most of the movies followed the novels pretty closely except for Gold.  There was no such plot in the novels.  In what battle scenes there were, the cannons were too big and the battalions were too small.  I guess that unless the film is big budget, platoons have to suffice for battalions.  I probably would have like the movies more if I had seen them first.",1362700800,,456,4.6375
