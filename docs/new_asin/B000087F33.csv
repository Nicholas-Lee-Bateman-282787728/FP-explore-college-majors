7979319,4,B000087F33,"sakura is finding herself always tired. kero tells her that it's because it's using up a lot of her magic to change the cards. he also tells her that if she doesn't change the cards, they will disappear. to stop this from happening she tries to change multiple cards  at once and ends up confusing dash and scaring it. she does get dash to come down and return to a card. yue also reveals to kero that he is losing power and fears disappearing because sakura doesn't have enough magic to power him. sakura finds out that it's her great grandfathers birthday and decides to make him a gift like her mother use to and her great grandfather is instantly reminded of her mother, he then apologizes to sakura's dad gives him gifts for sakura and toya. sakura then gets trapped in Alice in wonderland and all her friends are the characters and give her clues to get out.",1375660800,,864,4.433962264150943

7979321,4,B000087F33,"In this latest volume we get the best indication yet into what may be Eriol's motive when we are shown that Sakura's thus far under-developed mahou shoujo powers as a neophyte Magical Girl may be insufficient for the needs of her new ""wards"", the cards and their guardians.  When in the second episode she discovers that the as yet-unchanged Clow cards have grown cold and lapsed into a dormant state lacking proper magical ""nutrition"", Sakura panics, attempting to change a whole handful of cards at once.  This not only makes things worse when the already-unstable Dash card again goes out of control and has to be chased down; but in the ensuing action, Sakura is forced to convert even more Clow cards into Sakura cards, further seriously and even perhaps dangerously weakening her own powers, despite Kero's protestations.  And to further advance the plot as we approach the inevetable conclusion, this ploy has the advantage of allowing around a dozen cards to be converted in a single episode instead of the somewhat plodding recent pace!

As yet unbeknownst to Sakura, Yue/Yukito is also feeling the loss of his own powers, dependent as he is on power ""reflected"" from his new master.  This seems to please Eriol's co-conspiritor Nakuru/Ruby Moon a great deal as he/she goes about his/her merry way as Toya and Yukito's classmate.  As usual for Sakura ( and in other series like this ), she seems completely oblivious to the clues Eriol insists on scattering liberally around, especially as to his ""true"" personality, most notably in the Wonderland spoof.  Although these are not my favorite episodes from this long series, one does stand out indicating the reason for Cardcaptor Sakura's continuing appeal.  We are again shown the inner workings of Sakura's rather complicated family, centering around her somewhat mysterous and estranged Great-Grandfather.  The resolution of this long-standing emotional conflict demonstrates that Sakura is worthy of being a mahou shoujo, having indeed a magical personality.  Tomoyo-chan and possibly her brother Toya have long recognized this; Kero and Yue have been won over; and finally the dense Shoran is beginning to realise the fact as well!",1264032000,,2194,5.137640449438202
7979322,4,B000087F33,I liked this series much better than Cardcaptors.  It made a lot more sense and all of the sub-plots were there.,1197504000,,112,4.333333333333333
7979323,5,B000087F33,"Problem when they brought this show over as Cardcaptors is they felt free to hack up 2 or 3 eps to make one to suit their idea of what American kids would like & this one gives us an ep about Sakura's Great-Grandpa we didn't get in Cardcaptors which is so typical of the sweet tone of Cardcaptor Sakura & so far away from the action-oriented Cardcaptors. Of course there is action in CCS, but there is also a whole lot of sweet, endearing friend/family moments which really start kicking up in this end of the story because Yukito, loved by Sakura & Toya, is struggling--sleepy(as is Sakura from the power drain of the cards running off her magic rather than Clow's), can't eat enough(we've always seen he eats enough for 3 or 4 people), blackouts as Yueh transforms to help Sakura, transforming back in different locations leaving poor Yukito wondering how he got there. While Keroberos draws power from the Sun, Yueh reflects his master's magic (like the moon) & Sakura isn't strong enough yet.
Li's realized it is Sakura he likes, but hasn't worked up the nerve to tell her--blushes a lot around her(cute). These 4 eps include the possessed bike & the Alice in Wonderland eps which made it in some form to Cardcaptors besides the Great-Grandpa ep, but of course this is far better. Yueh's the character which hooked me into anime & I've never thought much about Yukito(beyond how he has always provided a lot of clues to help Sakura before The Judgement ep where we met Yueh), but I felt sorry for him in this set of eps. Toya's worried--actually says he doesn't want Yukito to disappear so he obviously knows more than he's letting on.",1048291200,5,1639,4.616438356164384
7979324,5,B000087F33,"Sakura's Sheep Warning?!
 It's bad enough that Sakura is tired from converting Clow cards, but, now they have her counting sheep.
Sakura And The Panicy Bike
 Panic makes people and cards do mad things. Sakura panics when she finds she can't sense the cards properly, so tries to convert many cards without a reason for using them.
Sakura and the Calendar of Memories
 Sakura get a calendar that belonged to her mother, and finds that it is her great grandfather's birthday. She also is told why she has been told so little about her mothers family, which makes her want to bridge the gap.
Sakura, And Sakura from Wonderland
 Book reports coming up and Sakura is reading a rather strange mele of Alice in Wonderland and through the looking glass. Sakura get's a little chance to find out stuff she needs to know when she gets pulled into the book she is reading, but, she has never been too hot on working things out.",1047427200,3,916,4.567073170731708
