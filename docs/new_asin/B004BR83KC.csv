4320298,5,B004BR83KC,"This is a classic comedy with great acting,  great writing,  great everything. The actors surely got a raw deal when political manipulators tried to paint it as something it was not and succeeded in getting it out of mainstream circulation.  The fine actors greatly deserved more in royalties from this immensely popular and excellent comedy.  My favorite episodes are Kingfish Goes to Work ( in Volume 2) and The Gun (in Volume 7).  Boolah, Boolah and a great time to ya when you purchase this set!  It is so worth having.",1513468800,3,523,4.6923076923076925

4320325,1,B004BR83KC,"It is very sad that misplaced politically correct do gooders blast this show, and that NO good copies are available to buy. All current DVD collections are inferior, and not worth even 10 cents. Shame on CBS and the NAACP for censoring this TV series! The radio show and movies were offensive, yes, they had white people pretending to be black people. But the TV series was not like that and had excellent African-American actors in the roles and we saw black people as judges, policemen, business owners, etc. Amos was a hard working honest man and husband and father of three children. Years ago, on Ebay, I bought the series on VHS, bootlegged and they look as good as the DVD's now offered and I paid $15 plus $5 shipping.

The NAACP put many black actors out of work when they managed to get this TV series taken off the air. Tim Moore, who played Kingfish, cursed the NAACP and said the show was not racist and that many TV series showed white people in a bad light but stayed on the air. I notice that the NAACP said nothing when Sanford and Son showed Fred Sanford as ignorant and stupid and when George Jefferson was shown as a racist bigot.",1473552000,4,1150,4.4245283018867925

4320331,5,B004BR83KC,"This is a hilarious series with over 70 episodes and over 2100 minutes of viewing. These are some phenomenal actors. They've developed knee-slapping characters with humorous attributes.

As a child I used to watch these on TV and this series inspires nostalgia. Unfortunately, some liberal activists protested this series back in the 60s, but I feel the Amos 'n Andy Show was anything but racist. It was just pure humor and, would be so, regardless of the race of these actors. To call this show racist would be akin to calling Sanford and Son racist - it's simply not so, but the protestors had to find something to protest - this show was sacrificed and outstanding Black actors lost their jobs.

But apart from the politics of this show, I have to say that it ranks with the best series ever shown on TV. Also, despite the age of these films, due to digital remastering, they appear quite visually pleasant.

4320355,5,B004BR83KC,"the poor quality of the video and audio has nothing to do with the age of the series.  CBS owns the series in its entirety, and because of objections by the NAACP, pulled the show from syndication in 1966. Episodes were never offered to the consumer market, either in VHS or DVD format. What you are getting are ""bootleg"" copies or episodes from bad 16mm prints. All those bootlegs were culled together to produce some very bad quality videos, eventually finding their way to VHS and DVD, which is what you see being marketed today. Sadly, I doubt if this series will ever be released by CBS legitimately, in any retail form. Too bad, for Amos N' Andy was a brilliant show, full of belly laughs and fun. Never thought of this show as being derogatory to African Americans. You want that, then watch Sanford and Son. Insulting in every way.",1442102400,12,839,4.556291390728477

4320368,5,B004BR83KC,"I remember coming home from grade school, age 6 (1958) every day at 3:30 p.m. and watching ""Amos 'N Andy""! For some reason, I thought that King Fish looked a lot like my (recently deceased) grandfather--even though he was a Swede--because of that same mischievous grin and that stylish hat! Or maybe because, in the first episode, the hospital nurse mistakes Andy for an expectant father, and Kingfish, trying to help the situation, ends up saying ""Shake hands with the grandpa!"" In any event, I loved watching it every day! It was just as good as ""I Love Lucy"", but with a mostly black cast. For some reason, the show was pulled from syndication in the '60's for being ""politically incorrect"", i.e. Lightning the janitor showed blacks in a bad way. However, for the last 50 years blacks have been portrayed much worse on TV, talk shows and movies. Yes, Andy was the perpetual girl-watching bachelor, Kingfish and Calhoun were always trying some scheme to trick Andy out of the little money he had; but Amos was the married family man with a good job and the voice of reason. And at least Lightning had a job and worked at it every day! The show is set in New York, but to me it could just as easily have been downtown St. Paul, MN during the 1950's; the people of all colors looked very much like that. And don't you wish we could all get along with each other now, like we did back then?",1435276800,2,1389,4.450980392156863

I just so identified with the humor and love of family and friends in these shows. Oh ya, I am Scandinavian. There is something special about this period of the life of the African American that is unique from other Americans,and something they should be so proud about. I never understood how this was insulting,because I do not feel it made them seem inferior,but superior in their unique ability to make the most of their less than equal place in America at that time. These characters seem to have the perfect balance of valuing their faith,family and friends. They were so content with what they had,and were grateful for it all. We could all take a lesson on happiness from these characters.",1419984000,,806,4.597222222222222

As an Southern African American, I was not offended by Amos & Andy. Why was this show controversial?  I thought they show cased a lot of style & class and humor back in 50's. Yes, some  words were butchered but look at some of Tyler Perry's characters such as Madea and Mr. Brown, you will notice the same thing. And he has profited big time for this kind of humor.  Also look at Archie Bunker..this character did the same.  Many of my relatives enjoy watching  Amos & Andy for the 1st time.

Menu is very difficult to run through; don't expect to have the normal type of menu that one sees on most CDs that are commercially produced. Since these shows were recorded in the early fifties using what appears to be kinescope technology don't expect great video or audio quality. Being older, I remember these and similar shows on TV, and the quality was not great when they were originally broadcast. The shows are still funny, but unless someone is from the time they were recorded some of the humor and portrayal of characters do not fit our current times.

Then add Calhoun, the Lawyer and Lightnin' the janitor, and you have a whole mess of comedy.  This is SURE to crack you up with comedy!

Then again, Saffire's Mom is like Aunt Esther from ""Sanford and Son"", on STEROIDS!  Aunt Esther ain't got NOTHIN' on Kingfish's Mother-in-Law!

The video on the CD's is not too great, but good enough, since it was taken from either old film or whatnots, but each episode is so funny that you don't care.  The CD's are much better than when it was broadcast back when, with snow and horizontal/vertical holds, and antenna orientation being the major issues with the black and white TV's of the day.

After about 10 episodes of this CD collection, I can say that it is probably the best $40 that I have spent on entertainment!  I have some 64 more 30 minute episodes to go, and I hope my sides don't burst just laughing!  Kept my Wife up til 11PM last night so we could see one more . . . .

I'm not sure when Amos and Andy ran for the first time on television since I only remember seeing the repeats on Sunday afternoons. I believe this show ran on CBS though I wouldn't bet on it. By the time the late sixties came along this show was look upon as insulting by African Americans due to the way the main characters were stereotyped. The actors who were in this series found it hard to get work because they were so closely identified with this show.

4320512,5,B004BR83KC,"Even though I was a little kid in the 50s I do not remember this show. I knew of the radio version but was never really interested. Amos and Andy was produced by Hal Roach of Laurel & Hardy and Little Rascals fame. It is such a funny show. The comedic situations mostly revolve around the marital woes of George ""Kingfish"" Stevens and his wife Sapphire and Kingfish's schemes to con his friend and lodge brother, Andy, out of his money. Amos owns a taxi company and provides the introduction at the opening to some of the episodes. He is the most grounded and stable of the cast. Amos, Kingfish, Lightning, and lawyer Algonquin J. Calhoun are all lodge brothers in the Mystic Knights of the Sea fraternity.  The characters are well played and the writing is top notch. The Christmas episode is particularly touching with Amos explaining the meaning of the ""Lord's Prayer"" to his daughter on Christmas Eve. I really like it better than Honeymooners or I Love Lucy. The 5 star rating is for the show and its content. The picture quality is not good but that didn't prevent me from enjoying this classic American TV show.",1358208000,,1118,4.59

4320517,4,B004BR83KC,"I purchased this set as a gift for my father, who grew up with the radio broadcasts. Truthfully, I too enjoyed the old recordings he had of the A&A show and so, as a gift my father was surprised to know they even had this set available. This entire series is a classic of American TV and when you imagine how political correctness has ruined society you can't help but feel a little nostalgia for good, clean humor that is not demeaning but culturally important. It's not for everybody but the series is well worth the watch if this is your type of humor",1353888000,2,554,4.336538461538462
4320518,5,B004BR83KC,"Amos and Andy was a favorite of mine as a kid.  I never
knew the entire collection was available. It is just
fabulous.  The antics of Kingfish and Andy top anything
Lucy and Ethel ever thought of doing.  The quality is
great for the age.  I loved all the details of the scenery.  Everything reminds us of the era from the
outside of buildings, cars and cabs to the inside of the apartments and hospitals with lamps, phones and all kinds of furniture and equipment. Each and every
character creates their own part of the comedy and you just can't help but find yourself laughing out loud.
My cousin saw the collection and asked the price.  When
I told her she said, ""You'll get three thousand dollars

4320526,3,B004BR83KC,"Unfortunately, Amos N Andy series didn't receive the high recognition they deserve. Politics during the 1960s treated them unfairly.  The actors were so talented and funny without having to use foul language to get a laugh.  Good value however the audio video transfer to disc is fair.  One might consider getting the digital remastered upgrade for a few dollars more. Checkout the actors bios on [...]  Tim Moore came out of retirement to play The Kingfish and was born in the 1870s which probably means his parents were slaves.  Think about that kind of backround and progress.  We should honor these wonderful actors for their talent and hardships in their lifetime.

4320533,5,B004BR83KC,"I don't know if this show was ever aired in Australia, but it reminds me of a cartoon show I used to watch avidly every Saturday, which was titled ""Calvin and the Colonel"", and the cartoon is a spin off from the amos 'n' andy show. I've viewed one disc so far, and the shows are recorded from the best high quality tapes. The quality improves as you go from episode to episode. The first episode is clear, but looks kinda tired, and by the time you get to the fifth episode the picture and sound quality improve remarkably, and you'll have to adjust the sound volume down by the time you start watching that episode. The product manufacturing and the presentation is top notch, and the discs play well in my machines, and they have an easy to follow picture menu for each episode on the disc.
I am very pleased with the product itself, and even more pleased with the show amos 'n' andy as each actor in the show is brilliant and most believable. The scripts are very funny and the actors pull of the jokes extremely well and calmly. A lot of the scripts were written by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, who produced and wrote the 'Leave It To Beaver' and 'The Munsters' TV Shows. So if you also like those shows as I do, then you are sure to love 'The Amos 'n' Andy Show! Great entertainment for the whole family. Now in my own view it seems that Sydney Fields who wrote the Abbott & Costello Radio Program Shows, along with the complete first season of 'The Abbott & Costello' TV Show, and also played the boys landlord along with the character Melonhead, would of been influenced by 'The Amos 'n' Andy Show', as the same formula is used in each of the shows. So if you like great classic comedy shows, then you will definitely enjoy 'The Amos 'n' Andy Show'. For the price you can't go wrong. This package and show definitely achieve a 5 star rating, and thanks for producing it and making it available to International buyers, cheers!",1298332800,31,1933,4.387186629526463
