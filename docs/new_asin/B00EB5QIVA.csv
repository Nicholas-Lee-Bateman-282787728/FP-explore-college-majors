8603407,4,B00EB5QIVA,"Rip (Brennan Elliott) is a cop who is chasing a demon possessed vampire to the dismay of his wife (Kristi Clainos) and the police department who have different beliefs. Unknown to Rip, our vampire (Michael Bailey Smith) is a member of the CIA and is hunting terrorists in Los Angeles. The vampire hunts the bad guys while toying with Rip. The terrorist have a nuke in LA and plan to use it. They also have a goat head lamp genii to neutralize the vampire.

The film is campy. Rip asks the vampire about his evilness and says, ""How do you look at yourself in a mirror?""  But clearly the vampire had the best lines as he plays the tough guy, one that loves to take bullets. Rip tries out different types of bullets to kill the vampire. Our vampire chimes: ""Isn't silver for werewolves?"" or ""Now I'm going to smell like garlic while I kick your ...""

After an hour of fun the film settles down into a formula and drops off.

Good film for those who like the ""Dylan Dog"" type of stuff.
