2411385,1,B000BBOUK4,Could not review did not receive order.  Maybe it's a probem with the US Mail in New Orleans... Not happy.  Jerry Cole,1183939200,,118,4.318181818181818
2411386,5,B000BBOUK4,"I received this two-CD set as a gift and was pleasantly surprised. The name of this documentary is actually ""Crusade in the Pacific"" and was produced in the early 1950's. The narrator, the great Westbrook Van Voorhis, is excellent in describing the events of the great Pacific conflict. All the key events are well covered and are interspersed with first-hand accounts of soldiers in the field and excerpts of some key speeches by the war leaders of the time. I was especially impressed by the extent of the coverage which deals with the pre-war situation in the Pacific and concludes with the independence movements in such areas as the former Dutch East Indies, colonial India and French Indo-China. It also devotes a chapter to the Korean War. There are enough facts in the documentary to hold the interest of the viewer and the video footage is truly outstanding.

History buffs will be hard pressed to find a better documentary of the Pacific war. Well done.",1175731200,23,963,4.836363636363636
2411387,4,B000BBOUK4,"OK I got ripped off on this one as this is the exact duplicate of Crusade in the Pacific, which I already owned.

I also own Victory at Sea, the cheaper set, in which the picture quality is awful - washed out black and white. Also several of the episodes were cut by 4 mins. So War/Crusade in the Pacific is a better buy, all episodes are uncut and the picture quality is much better.",1135641600,50,384,4.12

2411390,5,B000BBOUK4,"War in the Pacific - Collector's Edition was a great surprise for me. Previous historical accounts dwell mostly on the fighting of key battles but this two disks volume(s) has a tremendous amount of supporting materials. It has snippets on how naval guns are loaded, ships refueled, carrier planes launched, landings... all those processes that describe in better detail of what fighting a war in the Pacific was all about. There are lengthy presentations by the typical key personal (General MacArthur and Admiral Halsey) but also rarer footage of General Eichelberger (Our Jungle Road to Tokyo), Winston Churchill, Sergio Osmena (Phillipines), and many more key personnel. The historical perspective is deep and well crafted. I've watched the entire series twice and still find new nuggets that lead me to reread my library on Okinawa, Leyte, New Guinea, to name a few moments in history. The section on the few years in Japan following the end of the war highlights the transition that military Japan evolved to the post war era of the New Japan. I believe that this is one of the best, thought provoking, supplemental material for anyone wishing to better understand our Pacific experience since the 1930's.",1407974400,,1211,5.090452261306533
2411391,5,B000BBOUK4,"this is for WWII junkies and should be bought by anyone that fits that category.  Victory and Sea and videos like this one give a good picture of what happened in the ""last good war"".  I wanted to add that the A bomb probably saved my dad.  He was drafted in August of '45 (had a war plant deferrment before then) and would have been fodder for the attack on Japan if the A bomb hadn't been dropped.  Don't let anyone tell you we didn't need to drop those A bombs.",1383004800,4,464,4.065934065934066

2411394,5,B000BBOUK4,"Took a chance and picked up a copy of this two-disc set at a local grocery store.  Have been pleasantly surprised--much better than expected.

Always been fascinated with WWII in the Pacific.  Watched many programs on The Military Channel and YouTube, and own a number of books on the subject.  This series could easily be used to teach a college course.

Highlights
- Over 11 hours of material.
- Contains footage rarely seen before.
- Contains lengthy segments that place events into historical perspective.  For example, America's westward expansion that led to the purchase of Alaska and settlement of Hawaii, Western influence in Japan and the socio-political settings of China, South East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand leading up to the war.
- Points out all the attacks that took place the day after Pearl Harbor on December 8th.  Never realized there were so many.
- Although there are better programs covering individual landings in the island-hopping campaign (Guadalcanal, Palau, Iwo Jima, etc.) no other program so exhaustively covers the entire sequence.  For example, it covers all six landings--albeit briefly--to retake New Guinea.
- Coverage of relatively minor operations such as kicking the Japanese off two islands in the Aleutians, and persistent Japanese raids early-on against a single port in Northern Australia.
- A fair amount of time is devoted to the role Australian ground forces played especially in retaking New Guinea.
- When a commander makes a mistake or benefits from a stroke of good luck the narration clearly says so.
- Really enjoyed the scoreboard graphic used after major sea battles to compare the win/loss ratios between the US and Japan.

Oddities
Starts and ends with a brief summary of the Korean Conflict.  Guess because that's when the program was produced.

Production Quality
- Film-to-tape transfer overall very good.
- Good choice in off-camera narrator.
- Occasional sound drop-outs (lowered volume or excessive muffling), but only in a few segments and towards the end of the series.

Interesting Factoids
- The Japanese were an insular society for centuries, which led to a belief they were superior to others--a belief formally incorporated into their primary religion, Shinto.  This belief combined with their focus on militarism and an expansionist foreign policy led to war.
- By the 1930s the Japanese had adopted many Western technologies--trains, autos, subways, telephones, banking, aviation, military hardware.
- Japanese devotion to militarism extended to indoctrination of children at an early age to ""play army.""  (Series includes some fascinating footage of this.)
- By 1942 to keep their factories running 24/7, Japan instituted forced conscription for anyone over the age of 15.  Drafted as laborers they were forced to work 16-hour days; 7 days a week.
- Japan never learned to use its submarines effectively.
- The principal reason for an island-hopping strategy was to advance the footprint of air power through the acquisition of airstrips.

Oddly Missing
- No mention of the role proximity fuses played in anti-aircraft ammunition after its introduction half-way through the war.
- No mention of the defective torpedo design US submarine commanders suffered with during the first few years of the war.

Conclusion
Highly worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in a more scholarly and comprehensive retelling of the war with Japan.",1340841600,5,3411,5.275415896487985
2411395,5,B000BBOUK4,"It is one of the best films of my War Documentary library. It is very comprehensive an it contains plenty authentic war footage. It is the yardstick I use to judge all other war documentaries. The quality of the B&W film varies, but it is generally good and above. The narration is  in sequence with the action, and supporting maps are good.
This is an old production, so it has some contemporary cultural and political references, which in no-way is detrimental to the film. Finally, it is a very-long documentary, it is easy to lose perspective of the time-sequence of events. It is a good idea to see it many times, it gets better every time.
Quality Warning: I recommend to put the DVD's in jewel boxes, as insertion in their case ends up damaging the DVD's center hole. I found this to be true for the old (double sided DVD`s ) and the new type case ( Single sided DVD's; I bought a replacement set). Furthermore, the new sets may not play in some DVD players. Example, mine does not play in the PC, but it does in the DVD player. I suspect quality issues. But the set is now very cheap, and the material very good.",1276560000,8,1120,4.384615384615385

The first is pre-war, and the last three are post war - e.g., how WWII effected India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Korea.  It series ends in the middle of the Korean war.  The video's contain maps, battle diagrams, allied eye witness accounts, strategy, and lots of B&W video's chronicling the action.  Highly recommended.
