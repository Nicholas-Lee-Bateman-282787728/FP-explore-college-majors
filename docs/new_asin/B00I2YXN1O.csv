6247973,5,B00I2YXN1O,"My son absolutely LOVES Animal Mechanicals. So glad to see that there is a DVD set for the series - Netflix only has about 20 episodes, and they go by so fast! Wasn't sure exactly what to expect, but the picture quality is very good, and menu options are basic but good. I mean, come on, it's a children's show - can't have too many special features or easter eggs going on.

All in all, I love this. Just wish there was a Volume Two...",1410652800,3,436,4.129411764705883

8638518,5,B00I2YXN1O,"This show came out of nowhere it seems and every kid I know is watching. Especially by daughter! The episodes are short, easy to follow for the little ones, and don't make you want to throw up while watching. The theme song gets stuck in your head but that's about it. Glad I bought this one.",1468108800,,292,4.232142857142857

8638520,3,B00I2YXN1O,"This is NOT WIDESCREEN. The presentation is 4x3. I am not sure why anyone would release a DVD in 4x3 for something that's created in widescreen (as they are shown on Netflix), but there you have it.

My kid loves this awful show, so it was nice to have something other than the dozen episodes that you can see on netflix, but I am disappointed that this DVD was apparently created by someone who thinks that televisions still look like large glowing square boxes.",1462838400,,463,4.511904761904762
