8326262,5,B001AOW7B0,"Tammytown is well written story about two Tammies who have to fight against a town that they cannot seem to adjust too. They might as well be best friends in 90210, or perhaps mayberry, but in the rural-stripmall-suburb they are as good as their options. Options seem to be limtied to typical sex and booze, which can drive you to search for a little more value in life (for some of the cast-not for others!). In the end we find what each Tammy must do to make her fate her own. This is a silly, good time laugh fest that will leave you crying ""too soon"". I eagerly await the sequel TammiTown2: This Time it's Personal.",1217203200,,619,4.344827586206897
