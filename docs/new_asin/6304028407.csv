7860834,4,6304028407,"I found the first three of four VHS tapes to be both informative, thanks to the two West Point historians providing their analysis, as well as entertaining.  By the end of the third VHS tape, the viewer witnesses the period of Vietnamization draw down of US troops to 50,000. The entire set of tapes consists of newsreel footage - a strength in that there are many first-hand eye-witness accounts but a weakness in that all the accounts are from the US perspective.
However, I was disapponted by the fourth VHS tape as it focuses solely on the helicopter extrication of some 6000 individuals before the fall of Saigon in 1975.  Nothing is mentioned about the negotiation of the treaty between the USA and North Vietnam under Kissinger's stewardship and the Christmas bombing to put pressure on North Vietnam to reach an accomodation with the USA. In thiz final VHS tape, there is no analysis. All of a sudden, the viewer leaps to 1975 with intervening events ignored.
Of course, the VHS format is not ideal but I still have a VHS player and the quality of the tape was good.  I am not sure what exactly other reviewers are reviewing but I have reviewed the 4-pack VHS Vietnam on the Frontlines.  At the current price of less than ten dollars, I would consider this set of tapes a bargain (too bad I paid considerably more for them).",1394150400,,1332,4.6075949367088604
7860835,5,6304028407,"This was a brief and very telling anecdote to the later ""feel good"" film, We Were Soldiers"" of the same battle, the Ia Drang Valley battle of Nov 14-18 1965. This brief documentary includes reminiscences of participants including Colonel Moore of the First of the 7th Air Cav, and Colonel Anh of the NVA and his superior officer, who were in command of the battle. It is far more honest in its representation which includes memory of the haymaker ambush by the NVA after the main battle was over (the Americans thought). The battle was highly significant since General Westmoreland chose to ignore the disastrous ambush and take his lesson from the main battle, which the US ""won"" in terms that had little application in Vietnam, and also Secretary of Defense Macnamara may have concluded, based on this battle, that the war was unwinnable in any terms the American people would accept, yet kept his counsel for three more years. The Hollywood film, we were soldiers, based on Col. Moore's study of the battle, was dishonest and a disservice to Colonel Moore and all the brave soldiers on both sides who fought this battle. It came out just in the wake of 9/11 and as we were gearing up for Iraq and may have fed the need for Americans to feel good about themselves, but it was an historical atrocity which this earlier documentary repairs.

7860836,5,6304028407,"This series, presented by Walter 'most trusted man in America' Cronkite is good for anyone one wanting to view an unbiased account of the Vietnam war. There is no Barber's Adagio over the footage, no critical narration - it lets the footage and facts speak for itself - boo-koo information as a VET would say.",1084233600,7,309,4.636363636363637
