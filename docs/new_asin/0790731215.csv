90443,5,0790731215,"Those looking for some sort of deep meaning underlying the film will likely be disappointed but if you are looking for a great evening of 1950's popcorn fare this is it. In fact despite some of its drawbacks it still has something that leaves one with the feeling that the whole film is a whole lot better than the sum of the parts - one of those that you can't quite place your finger on why you like it so much. Unfortunately, people tend to keep reviewing these films through the lens of today's high budgets and often over the top special effects.

Folks when this flick was made computers were the size of large offices, gasoline was around 30 cents a gallon and jet airline service had been around for only four years - get some perspective. This movie gets points just for nostalgia value alone.

Oh, and please don't go by what the fellow below with the 'sickening' review said - he obviously has some greater issues to deal with and is likely the type ready to trample all over your fun because it doesn't fit into some perverse Politically Correct  mold.

Enjoy the Movie!",1153785600,8,1082,4.477157360406092
90444,3,0790731215,"A group of dorky-macho scientists winds up 500 years or so in the future, where it encounters all kinds of ""Star Trek""-style nonsense. I refer to: skinny, carefully-spoken, pacifist leaders in goofy, uni-sex suits. Voluptuous women in cocktail outfits. D.W.-Griffith-style cavemen with twenty-word vocabularies (verbs and nouns only). Arty but cut-price sets. Multiple grave dangers that yield to redundant dialogue exchanges (followed by short bursts of contrived action). The world needs to be saved, and these intrepid nerds have an extra 15 minutes or so in which to accomplish same, so... why not? After all, they're hundreds of years away from home. They've got nothing else to do, besides future-girl-watch.

Luckily, the film is saved from total lame hilarity by competent, fast-paced direction (Ed Bernds, who also gave us ""Return of the Fly"" and ""Queen of Outer Space""), unusually good acting for something like this, and neat special effects--especially the rocket, as it blasts through space, wriggles about in a time-whatever (a warp? Can't remember), and then crashes into the snowy surface of the future-Earth. No more sexist, macho, or Eisenhower-era-esque than the average ""Star Trek"" episode (was this one of Gene Roddenberry's favorite films?), ""World Without End"" is an entertaining time-travel capsule of its day. The fun outweighs the inanity, so I give it two and a half stars. (Three, by default.)",1086307200,7,1421,5.37219730941704
90445,3,0790731215,"WWE has several things going for it -
(1) It's in color
(2) The actors are a notch above the usual refugees from Central Casting
(3) The model effects and general production values are good.
HOWEVER,...
The story of a spaceship hurled 500 years into the future to land on a bombed-out Earth was old-hat when the movie was made almost 50 years ago.  Why the normal humans in the underground city dress in outfits straight out of the Middle Ages while their environment is all straight-line futurism is beyond me.  And however decrepit the men from the future are, whatever made them that way apparently didn't affect the women who all seem to be runners-up in the ""Miss I-Survived-The-Apocalypse"" beauty contest. Add to that a hefty dose of 1950's male superiority and a lot of old feathers about atomic mutation and this movie stinks faster than a Mob snitch in the East River.
For crying old loud people, the leader of the mutants is a one-eyed cretin who has all of the agility of a dancing bear.  SNEAK UP BEHIND HIM!",1071273600,12,1020,4.593406593406593
90446,4,0790731215,"I had not seen WWE for more than 25 years.  I remember it as a SF movie that shook me to my core. Even then, most movies did not begin with a framing sequence, but this one had the audacity to place the upcoming action in centuries-jumping sequence that quickly and convincingly landed the actors in the far future of an earth ruined by atomic war.  As a child, I had just read, Wells' 'The Time Machine' and I connected the similarities: the handsome travelers (one of whom,by the way, was Rod Taylor, star of the 1960 'The Time Machine);the division of humanity into the intelligent but weak humans who are threatened by the savage Morlocks; the abundance of tall, sexy women who could appreciate Rod Taylor's beefcake (Yvette Mimeux in 'The Time Machine' and Nancy Gates in 'WWE'; and the struggle between the two races of a divided humanity.  Still, WWE was more than just 'The Time Machine' reborn.  Despite the hokey special effects, it became clear that WWE was not a movie of special effects.  The focus was on people adjusting to a colossal change in their lives.  The time travelers had to learn to adjust to the loss of their known civilization. The weakened humans had to learn to adjust to a savage reminder of their past in the pistol packing personas of the time travelers.  And even the mutated beasts had to learn that with the death of their fearsome leader Naga, a new dawn of human reconciliation had begun.  The closing scenes of the unity of pre-war man, post-war man, and mutated man still resonate with me.  I could sense that humanity might yet survive the horror of atomic war.  WWE was one of the first intelligent post-apocalyptic films to suggest that our civilization need not take the detour that the Mad Max films would later travel.",1015632000,54,1765,4.628205128205129

90448,5,0790731215,"Unquestionably this is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen.  I first saw it on Million Dollar Movie in New York City during the early 1960s and saw it many times during that period.  It was probably one of the first science fiction films I ever saw.  What I remember most was the mood, the sense of wonder, fear, and hopefullness that imbued the film.  It placed human beings firmly in the center of their world, able to deal with whatever hardships history dealt them.  The special effects were so few they might as well have  been nonexistent.  Even today when I see it I still get chills during the final scenes, especially the one showing the children of the advanced humans (once sickly and dying but now healthy) playing with the children of the mutant humans.  The video could use a re-release in wide screen since there are obviously scenes when characters are speaking out of sight.  I recommend this movie highly to one and all.",978912000,32,951,4.547058823529412
90449,5,0790731215,"I saw this movie once on a Sci-Fi matinee back in the 60s when I was about 12 years old.  I was swept away by this vision of the future and the hopeful heroic message of survival and rebuilding after a nuclear holocaust.  It became my favorite movie, and although I searched, I never saw it again until this video was released.  Now I still enjoy it, and it is a favorite of my three children.  Part of what we enjoy is how camp it appears to today and it is educational (we homeschool) to discuss with the children how differently movies are made today, from  special effects to how women are portrayed.  This movie won't scare young children, especially since you can use rewind and slow/stop motion to get them to notice the spiders are ""puppets"", and laugh at the protagonists wrestling with them.  The improbability and good fortune (for our protagonists) of sickly males and EXTREMELY healthy high heeled females intrigued by red blooded 20th century men makes for campy fun and a male fantasy that transcends the decades.
The production values and casting are good.  This should be considered a Sci-Fi classic, that bears multiple viewings, especially since you will HAVE to share it with friends.",977097600,58,1204,4.7272727272727275
90450,4,0790731215,"Should Steven Speilberg ever decide to do a remake, this film should be on his short list. How this mid-50's sci-fi drama has remained hidden from sci-fi buffs is beyond me. The poor special effects provide a chuckle, but do not detract from the quite plausible (in the world of science fiction, anyway), well-conceived storyline that keeps your attention throughout the film. You find yourself bonding to the characters, following them on their journey, wherever it takes them. And isn't that what is required of any good film? Well acted, despite its obvious low budget (remember: Speilberg budgets were unheard of in the 1950's), the sexy outfits the ladies don and the predictable male-as-hero scenarios provide, shall I say, multifaceted entertainment? Nonetheless, this film was created not more than ten years after two atomic bombs were dropped in a major world war. The dawn of the nuclear age was not lost on Hollywood. Mankind (and the film industry) was still shuddering from the wake of its terrible consequences. 'World Without End' was born in that age; and being 'of its time', it hints at man's newly acquired, dubious achievement of mutually-assured-destruction. The film asks some sobering questions: Is mankind capable of altering it's own destiny? Will we survive our own technological prowess? Dim the lights, sit back, pass the popcorn, forgive the '50s special effects, and enjoy the film.",948153600,13,1413,5.17467248908297

The film has several things going for it, including good dialog, good acting and excellent sets.  The special effects are about average for the time, and there are no extras for the film.  There is a glaring plot hole in the movie, namely that astronauts going to orbit Mars had pistols, hatchets and knives with them.  This is despite the fact that they had no intention of landing on the world, nor reason to use these weapons if they did when the film admits that life on Mars would be primitive or nonexistent.  One nice touch was that unlike many other movies with time travel, World Without End makes it a one way trip.

The only real hokey part is the obvious model spaceship flying through space but that just adds to the fun.

Our Aussie Rod Taylor, in I think his first Hollywood role, just strikes the right note as a beefcake crew member. Though it's tremendously amusing to hear his trained stage/radio voice, unless it was supposed to be like that, which he obviously never used again in his films.

I never give more than just a hint of any storyline, suffice to say it's a mix of, and shades of, The Time Machine and Planet of the Apes without the apes.

90580,5,0790731215,"As with all reviews of science fiction / space travel movies from the early 50s, one must look at the time it was made and the scientific knowledge base at the time as well as the technical capabilities of movie-making as well.  Taken in that context, World Without End is a fun ride.  First foray into spaceflight?  Well, why not go to Mars?  And then on the way back use an outer space physics phenomenon to throw the rocket 500 years into the future?  Sure, why not?  I mean, it was kind of used (with suspended animation - still not a real thing today) in everyone's critical darling, Planet of the Apes.  Yes, the spiders look kind of silly today.  But remember, there was no CGI back then.

I was kind of struck with the story (I think I read HG Wells' family sued the producers of the film) and its parallels to The Time Machine.  Far flung future where mankind has evolved into two distinct races.  The Mutates, who live on the surface and whose DNA has been damaged by radioactive levels (which have since subsided to livable levels).  And the ""normal"" people (I don't think they named their civilization), who live underground.  A race where men have devolved into passionless, passive, weak-willed shadows of usual male attributes (kind of like the beta males of today), and all the women are leggy, beautiful, and naturally attracted to the aggressive, masculine men of days gone by.  I was especially amused that Rod Taylor starred in this movie as well as The Time Machine (about 6 years later).

Taken wholly within the context of the era, it's a fun ride.  Just don't attach today's standards, mores and values to a movie made 61 years ago.",1496448000,19,1656,4.581632653061225

CGI-weaned kids and those with short attention spans will likely find this flick kinda dull & boring. Outstanding hi-def transfer really makes this Cinemascope Technicolor film pop. 4 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): A rocketship returning from the first manned reconnaissance of Mars accidentally over-accelerates, hurling the quartet of astro-scientists on board some 500 years forward in time. Stranded on a bizarre, post war-to-end-all-wars future Earth, our stunned heroes struggle to survive all manner of threats, including deadly cave spiders & psycho cyclops. They eventually encounter a civilization of ""normal"" healthy folks, who moved underground eons ago to escape the radiation-soaked world above. Well, they're normal with one small exception: the male population has grown soft over the generations and are now almost entirely sterile, whereas the women (for some unexplained reason) are still plenty fertile. To the gals these headstrong, testosterone-fueled newcomers are all but irresistible. And if that wasn't threatening enough to the sissy-fied subterrestrial menfolk, our hearty back to the future boys then try to convince everyone to move up to the surface and reclaim it. Sure there are tribes of bloodthirsty musclebound mutants to conquer, and of course reestablishing a colony topside will certainly take lots of hard work... but hey! think of the benefits! Right? The all-male council of future wimps naturally balk at this frightening suggestion, especially one hyper-paranoid fellow (played to perfection by a twitchy Booth Coleman), who takes every opportunity to poison the council against our heroes. A grim battle of wills inevitably ensues, and when things turn ugly... what will the outcome be?? Tune in and found out!

THOUGHTS: From Allied Artists, (the hallmark of mediocrity!), comes 1955's WORLD WITHOUT END (aka 'Flight To the Future'), a fairly by-the-numbers flick that checks off most every box in the well-worn space/future genre. (A 'dodging a swarm of meteors' scene is notoriously missing.) WORLD WITHOUT END is pure Saturday Matinee fluff, chock full of sturdy science studs, gorgeous gals with gams up to here, hairy ""mu-tates"" and wolf-sized rubber spiders. Added together, that equals 80 minutes of family-friendly comfort food fun. Some of the low ratings here for this film (and the reasons for them) baffle me. I mean... really? Complaining about the various shortcomings of a B-grade 50's-era science fiction movie is silly. It's like complaining that a grilled cheese is too cheesy. (1 & 2 STAR voters please ask yourself these questions: What year was this filmed? What is the subject matter? Who was the writer/director? Who was the intended audience? IMHO, this simplistic, unpretentious film 100% hits the bullseye of every target it was aiming for. You dissatisfied viewers apparently should have opted for ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Chariots of Fire"" or some other such high falootin' fare.)

THE BLU-RAY: Warner Archives gives us a pretty nice transfer for the Blu-Ray debut of this sci-fi nugget. Color is strong & solid, with no artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise) that I could detect. Sound is clean, level, loud and mercifully devoid of the hissing, pops or crackles that sometimes plague older films (though the soundtrack does warble a little during the closing credits). However, being a W-B Archive release means your options are ""Play Movie"" & ""Subtitles On/Off"" ...and that's it. No bonus content. The lack of extras is disappointing, but sadly not surprising for these Warner Archive releases. If you have this flick on DVD I can safely recommend double-dipping for the improved picture & sound this Blu-ray offers. Fans of these kinds of films should enjoy this spiffed up hi-def release of WORLD WITHOUT END.",1491955200,15,3991,5.3824
90610,5,0790731215,"I first saw World Without End about a year after its initial release; It was a Saturday matinee viewing for about 25 cents. In those days (the 50s), people took seriously the possibility of war between the USSR and the US. As a child, I thought war was likely.

At that time I was thunderstruck after viewing the movie. As a nine-year-old then, I could not articulate the reasons, but now I can. What is strikingly memorable is the interplay between the characters and their development. On display, by the characters in the movie, are bad traits certainly, but also what is best in human beings: Courage, self-sacrifice, love, and optimism about future possibilities. Let's not forget too, the story is romantic and, of course, has a happy ending.

90613,3,0790731215,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'World Without End' released in March, 2017 by Warner Archive Collection.

This is strictly for fans of 1950's movies and today's younger audiences would probably want to stay away unless you are a collector of thses types of movies or enjoy old movies.
This is a bare bones blu-ray release with no extra's.

BLU-RAY: The picture is quite good. I didn't notice any imperfections. The image, while not perfectly sharp is very clear. The colors are vivid and you will not be disappointed. The only reason I don't give the picture quality 5 stars is because I believe it might be possible to make it slightly better even if nobody ever bothers. I don't like to give 5 stars unless the picture looks absolutely perfect. For all I know it might be perfect and the clarity of the picture might be as good as it gets due to the way it was filmed.

EXTRA'S: There are no extra's other than subtitles.

PLOT/SUMMARY: It's 1957 and 4 astronauts are on the first manned mission to space. As they are rounding Mars they lose communications with home. On the way back to earth their rocket ship starts accelerating at an incredible pace...probably more than 100 miles per second...and they lose control of the ship. After they decelerate they eventually come to rest on an unknown planet. They notice that conditions are similar to earth with the exception that radiation levels are higher than normal. They soon come to the realization that they are on earth and that they are victims of time dilation. Judging by the landscape they assume that they are somewhere in the Rockies. They know that it is now sometime after the year 2188 because that is the lastest date on numerous tomb stones. They correctly assume that there was a nuclear war and that it might be a few hundred years after 2188. They encounter 1 eyed mutants that look human and are extremely violent. They are chased into a cave where they find an underground entrance. Once inside they meet humans such as themselves. While technologically advanced, these humans are extremely timid and are frightened to ever leave their cave. The astronauts find out that it is the year 2508. We also learn that they are dying out because the men are becoming sterile (I think, or possibly the women can't reproduce.) Our four astronauts try to convince the cave people to go outside but fail. We have a bit of drama between all involving the women (who are all beautiful!) and our astronauts. After an attempt to blackmail the four astronauts fails, they finally convince the leaders to allow them to begin building outside the caves. Mankind begins anew.

PRODUCTION/THOUGTHS:  'World Without End' was shot in Technicolor.  The movie was budgeted at around $400,000. A decent amount for a science fiction picture at the time. For what it's worth the movie looks good in color.

Rod Taylor would star in H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine,' a few years later, a movie with similar ideas. Or more to the point, 'World Without End' copied the ideas from H.G. Wells.  In fact, Allied Artists were sued by the H.G. Wells estate for plagiarism.

The spider scene in the cave is terrible and should have been left out. The Spiders which has also been used as a prop in other movies is just plain awful looking. It almost looks like a stuffed animal. It is completely immobile and I imagine could only have met with laughs in it's theater release.

I thought the movie was decent but not particularly well thought out. The director is on record stating that he felt rushed.

RECOMMENDATIONS:  This release is recommended strictly for fans of 1950's science fiction.
I give it 4 stars for the picture, 1/2 star for the extra's (just subtitles) and 2 1/2 stars for the movie itself.
I won't give a release such as this 5 stars unless you get something extra or it is released at a lower price...say 9.99. I think for the money they should give you something extra.
Let's call it 3 stars overall.",1490659200,16,3966,4.672883787661406

As for the movie, yes, I'll concede that it is a B movie wearing widescreen Technicolor clothes. I have a deep abiding love for 50's sci-fi and World Without End for me is the quintessential example of the genre. We have in one movie - one! - rockets, Mars, time travel, mutants, giant cave spiders, an advanced society vs. primitive society, bazookas and pretty girls in futuristic mini skirts.
To briefly cover the plot; the crew of a spaceship in an orbital study of Mars gets caught up in time vortex and crash land into a snow-covered mountain. Not knowing where they have landed, they set off exploring. Their first encounter is with overgrown spiders in a cave, then a band of disfigured cave men attack their camp. Eventually they learn that they are on Earth five hundred years in the future. While evading another attack by the mutant cave men, they take shelter in another cave that happens to be an entrance to an underground society of the non-mutant survivors of humanity.
The balance of the movie involves the crew trying to convince the stagnating society to return to the surface and live in the sunlight. There are several themes at play here such as the decline of civilized people in a closed society and the dangers of weapons in a peaceful world.
I've watched this move and other like it countless times. I grew up watching these types of movies on late night creature features and Saturday afternoons. You might say they are in my DNA. I know they are not great movies but I love them and can't thank companies like Warner Archives for remembering that fans like me are still around.",1487548800,24,1894,4.461095100864553
90615,1,0790731215,"The yesteryear of science fiction isn't always a pretty thing, and World Without End suffers from that very fact.  The film is extremely dull both in concept and construction, and the actors don't help much.  The story is pretty simple.  You have a group of astronauts (why are there only four of them) who wind up five centuries from their time period to land on earth after a cataclysmic explosion that forced civilized human beings underground and away from the mutants that rule above ground.  These astronauts try and give the reclusive humans a backbone while avoiding their jealousies and trying to dethrone the evil monstrosities outside.  The makeup is effective (if not a tad tacky) on the mutants, but the actors are so boring and the color pallet is terrible.  They could have tried something to make the outside seem perilous, but its just dust and dirt and the less said about that spider scene the better.  It may not be Ed Wood terrible, but it cant be far off.",1383609600,,977,4.678362573099415

90617,3,0790731215,"Take a look at the awesome original poster reproduced on this Italian import DVD of the film:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Without-End-Dvd-Italian-Import/dp/B0048KQQ3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Without End (Dvd) Italian Import</a>&nbsp;Pretty cool eh?  It's got that sort of surreal/abstract look that a lot of late 50s and 60s science fiction paperbacks had.  Alas the movie doesn't quite live up to it.  Hugh Marlowe and Rod Taylor and two other guys you've never heard of (unless you know your 50s b-movie actors better than I do, and I know them fairly well) are on a manned mission to Mars, when they run into some strange magnetic cloud or something (never explained but that's what it looks like) that makes their ship speed up and knocks them all out. They wake up having landed in snowy mountains, their ship damaged. Quickly figuring out that they're not on Mars and that the air is breathable by the simple expedient of just opening the hatch (!!), they venture out and down the mountain into an arid, rocky western landscape. In short order they encounter ridiculously stupid-looking giant spiders and a cemetery full of tombstones that date from 200 years after their blast-off from earth. Now we get 5 minutes of an explanation of time dilation, followed by an attack by ugly cyclopean mutants! Taking refuge in a cave, they are soon in the underground world of the human survivors of the atomic wars, who seem to be all withered and effeminate old men and totally hot young babes (one of them played by Nancy Gates, a serious beauty who wasn't a bad actress and should have had a better career; she made her last film four years later at 34 in a fine role in one of the greatest of all westerns, COMANCHE STATION, with Randolph Scott). The leaders of the underground city don't want to help the men get back to their ship, or to fight the mutants; the women on the other hand appreciate the virile newcomers, especially Taylor when he takes his shirt off...

As you can tell, this is a fairly silly film that hasn't exactly dated well. It's kind of a shame that it's the first science fiction film shot in Cinemascope, because it doesn't exactly deserve to be remembered even for that accomplishment.  If you've got this VHS, you're not missing as much I think as you would be with a really well-shot production from a director who really knew how to use the cinematic space.  Director Edward Bernds had done, and continued to do, mostly work on poverty-row budgets or not much better; this was probably his most ""prestigious"" film.  On the other hand, the use of color (cinematography by Ellsworth Fredericks) and music (Leith Stevens) are fine, and buried inside the ludicrous plot are some interesting ideas, particularly if you're at all knowledgeable when it comes to SF literature. The basic plot - a trip forward in time that shows the human species diverged into savage and weak and cowardly halves goes back to H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" - and, interestingly, actor Rod Taylor would find his greatest fame as the star of the MGM film based on that novel 4 years later. And the notion of the emasculated men being ultimately overthrown in a manner of speaking by their more agressive women's championing of the newcomers has all kinds of interesting things to say both about the sexual frustrations in the 50s as more women were going to work and ""sexual liberation"" was just around the corner, and about our notions of peace and agression - unlike most ""liberal Hollywood"" science fiction, this borrows from the playbooks of conservative/libertarian writers like A.E. Van Vogt and Robert A. Heinlein.

Science fiction in film and TV, while it pretends to look forward, too often seems to lag behind culturally and socially, and many of the notions about evolution, the roles of scientists, and mankind's propensity for violence in this film date back to the 1930s pulps; though I guess one could say that the odd color schemes of the interiors and the clothing of the future-men, and the womens' miniskirts point forward to ""Star Trek"" a decade later.  All in all it seems that the future of 2508 as imagined in 1956 just wasn't ready for any kind of adult thinking about the way the species might actually evolve socially and morally.  Not that one should expect, or desire, such deep philosophizing in a cheap Hollywood production aimed mostly at entertaining the kids, but in this case the political and ethical considerations are too obviously on the surface to completely dismiss - though I think it's still pretty easy to just have fun with the thing, it's not as if the film is deliberately trying to hammer it's message across at the expense of cheap thrills.

Pretty much a time-killer all in all, fun in a brainless way but certainly not one of the better SF films from a decade that was full of great ones.  The best way to get it would be in the 4-film package&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Greatest-Classic-Films-Collection-Sci-Fi-Adventures/dp/B002TSAAS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: Sci-Fi Adventures</a>&nbsp;which also contains the much better THEM! and BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS as well as the so-so SATELLITE IN THE SKY.
