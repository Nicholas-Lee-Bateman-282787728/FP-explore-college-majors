3736753,5,B001OXLGIM,What's to say.  Sinatra gone.  Shows are still hilarious.  Technically looks great.  That all elusive 11th season is one step closer.  How many years have we waited patiently for a complete set of this series????????  The hell we have gone through with this product has taught me all I ever wanted to know about the marketing gurus of the new America.  I no longer buy individual seasons no matter how tempted I am.  Because I know that: 1. The whole series may never be released in it's entirety.  2. If it is it will be repackaged with dubious extras and released in toto at a lower price.  3. Double dipping is no longer restricted to Baskin Robbins.  The studios have very little respect for the consumer anymore and the feeling is now mutual.  DVD sales have tapered off dramatically and steadily the last few years AND THEY WONDER WHY!  Of course I'm aware of the packaging issues too.  The scratched discs.  The missing discs.  The lack of customer service and I could go on forever.  I just want to get the 11th season and be done with it!!!!  Lesson learned.  Move on.,1238112000,3,1077,4.515625
3736754,3,B001OXLGIM,"Every since Steve left, and even slightly before that, the show changed from a stinging and hilarious parody of married life into a vapid sleaze-fest.  Even season 9 had some classics, but having sat through season 10...

...unfortunately, not much of it is very funny and many jokes of which are one-note (the chicken legs bit, ""No Ma'am"", et al).  Worse, the usual jokes get worn out fairly quickly and what's left are a bunch of ""I should stop wearing my co**om"" and ""I am going to have *** with a woman with big **easts!!"" followed by loud hooting and hollering from an audience that's probably composed of felons freshly released from the penitentiary.  That's probably a bit harsh...

Though, on the plus side, there are the occasional jokes that work extremely well (e.g. Bud and his idiot friends singing a raunchy song and Marcy promptly tells them to 'shut up!').  And certain episodes, such as ""Turning Japanese"", are reminders that consistently hilarious episodes could still be made.  Just not as often.  :(

Still, by and large, this season is a step down from its former glory.  But it managed to keep viewers laughing enough to land an 11th produced season.  And I can easily imagine the 10th year being so bad it would have been canceled.  In which case this would be a 1-star for completists only. But it's not.

So, what's to come in season 11:  ""The Stepford Peg"" where Peg gets amnesia and actually has to do housework (a classic!), Kelly ending up hosting a children's program, the one with Marcy's cousin and Al being tempted (but doesn't know a secret about his cousin), Robert Englund playing the devil and Al sells his soul (another classic), Kelly has to be a practicing nun to get into a commercial (pretty good episode), et al -- the final season actually shows some new life.  Indeed, I was indeed annoyed when the show was ultimately and unceremoniously canceled, but that's another story...  at least the show ended on a high note.",1237766400,6,1963,4.712609970674487
3736755,5,B001OXLGIM,"This next to last season of MWC is one of the best. Unfortunately Katie Sagal is missing from a few episodes but I believe this was due to her pregnancy. Still there are 20-something hilarious episodes. Some that stand out are ""Cooking with Butter"" and the two part ""Spring Vacation"" episodes. If you are a MWC fan you will want this one for your collection.",1237766400,2,358,4.523076923076923
3736756,5,B001OXLGIM,"If you like the Bundy family's triumphant representation of the dysfunctional family you will love this latest installment.  There are only a few clunker episodes in the set, as opposed to the hideous Season 7 wasteland.

I love Al Bundy.  What more can I say?  Everything he does or says makes me laugh; his facial expressions and body language reveal his character so perfectly he could almost get by without saying a word or doing anything.  Ed O'Neill has that degree of talent.  Sadly, his co-stars don't, but they simply have to be there or there'd be no show for Al Bundy to become a TV immortal in.

I've heard far too many boneheads dismiss this show as vulgar or stupid or low-brow.  Well of course it is!  That is its charm and triumph: it transcends vulgarity, stupidity and low-brow humor by making those qualities almost lovable as exemplified by the Bundy family.

Well, it makes you laugh or it doesn't.",1237161600,9,919,4.6521739130434785
3736757,5,B001OXLGIM,"In 1995-96,Fox's MARRIED...WITH CHILDREN was still in the Top 10 along with its animated network mate,THE SIMPSONS. FRIENDS,FRASIER,MURPHY BROWN,HOME IMPROVEMENT,COACH and ROSEANNE were still pulling in strong viewership then as well. Still,there are no changes within the cast. Guest stars this season include GROWING PAINS veteran Alan Thicke,gridiron great Terry Bradshaw and CHARLES IN CHARGE and BAYWATCH veteran Nicole Eggert. Yes,Al Bundy(Ed O'Neill) still manages his shoe store and runs his NO MA'AM club with co-founder Jefferson D'Arcy(HAPPY DAYS veteran Ted McGinley). Al's wife Peggy(Katey Sagal) still sits on her rear in front of the TV munching on bonbons and other junk foods. Al's and Peggy's daughter Kelly(Christina Applegate)still waitresses on roller skates while her brother Bud(David Faustino) still works as a driving instructor. Jefferson is still waitering at his topless bar and still has his wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) and their cherished Mercedes Benz.",1236902400,4,981,5.819444444444445
3736758,5,B001OXLGIM,I also look forward to seeing the eleventh and final season come out.  I had recorded almost every show off the air on VHS.  However I missed one or two from each season and what I have is full of pops and fizzles.  Having a nice clean recording of each season will be good.  One of the nice things about DVD is when you see a familiar actor and check out the guest actors in the credits and see the name of someone who now stars in another show or movie.,1233964800,4,455,3.967032967032967
3736759,5,B001OXLGIM,"The Bundy's 1995-96 Season is awesome and was probably the 2nd best season of them all throughout it's whole 10-year run on FOX and I can hardly wait till it's released this Spring on St. Patrick's Day this year.

The Bundy's 10th Season is also the season when Bud(David Faustino) and his buddies get snookered by the doofus Kelley Bundy(Christina Applegate) and her ditzy girlfriends by stealing their trip to Florida where Kelley gets elected ""Miss Spring Break"", but justice ends up getting served at the end of that episode when Marcy(Mandy Bearse), Bud(David Faustino) and his pals end up getting back at Kelley, Al(Edward O'Neill), Jefferson(Ted McGinley), and Kelley's ditzy girlfriends in Ft. Lauderdale, which by the way was my favorite episode from the Tenth Season.

The Bundy's 1995-1996 Season also has an episode when Kelley also gets hired to do a ""Mrs. Romantic Roast"" coffee commercial with Jefferson convincing people and audiences that Kelley is Jefferson's husband instead of Marcy.

This season also has an episode when Bud and the former high school geek get their sweet revenge on Kelley and her airheaded girlfriends at Kelley's 5-year high school reunion too.

So now that the Bundy's 10th Season is underway to be released in March, I hope to see the Bundy's 11th Season released by the end of this year, which shall give us the whole collection of all 11 seasons to watch on DVD to take us all the way back to memory lane during the days when MARRIED WITH CHILDREN was on Fox every Sunday night along with the fact that the Bundys Eleventh Season is even better than this one.

As a matter of fact I just got word that Married With Children's 11th Season is now underway and is scheduled to be released this Fall in October and I can hardly wait till then either.

In this season, it was also interesting seeing
cameos being done by Shannon Tweed and wrestler(King Kong Bundy)

*Famous former football player(Terry Bradshaw) doing a cameo in the episode when Al Bundy almost gets his high
school football field named after him

*Nicole Eggert guest starring in the ""Enemies"" episode after her co-starring days as Jamie Powell on CHARLES IN CHARGE and as Summer Quinn on BAYWATCH

*Mark Espinoza in the ""Al Goes To The Dogs"" episode after his co-starring days on BEVERLY HILLS 90210

*Alan Thicke in the ""Enemies"" episode after his co-starring days as Jason Seavers on GROWING PAINS

*Tim Conway in quite a few of this seasons episodes

3736790,4,B001OXLGIM,"I watched Married With Children while it was on the air and in reruns on cable, so when it was released on DVD I bought the complete set from another website.  Unfortunately, one DVD in the the tenth season does not work, so I bought a replacement for it from Amazon.  It is still one of the funniest comedies around but I am disappointed that the original opening and closing theme song has been changed.  I absolutely hate this generic theme song!  I don't think Sony realizes how much that song sets up the whole show.  The song about love and marriage is such a contradiction to how the Bundy's really live that it just makes the whole show so much more ironic.  I wish Sony had bothered to buy the rights to the original music because right now, I just fast-forward through the opening and closing music.",1396656000,,809,4.4324324324324325

3736792,3,B001OXLGIM,"As a kid me and my family used to call the show Al Bundy. I love this show, but I hate the intro music used in the DVDs. They removed the original intro ""Love and Marriage"" by Frank Sinatra because they were too cheap to pay for the rights to the song. Apparently they can pay for it to air on tv but they can't pay for it to be available in their DVDs. Long story short, I've sold all of my Married With Children DVDs because they are worthless to me without the song I grew up hearing as a kid. The song they used to replace it with is ugly and very irritating. I don't like having to skip through it every time just to watch the episode.",1392249600,,640,3.9307692307692306

3736798,5,B001OXLGIM,"In this Reviewers' opinion, one of the funniest sitcoms ever conceived. And in this DVD set of one of the last seasons, all indicators show that there was no letting up, in the laugh-out-loud department (before it became ""LOL"").

The battle of the Sexes never subsides with memorable line after memorable line. And as fast as they come, and as much as they are expected, they just get...funnier.

I was prompted to buy this set in recall of the ""Reverend Al"" episode, a wild entry obviously referencing the recent trails and tribulations of the Preacher Jimmy Swaggart. Another terrific episode: Al and ""No m'am"" members attempt to erect asatellite dish on the roof, while the wives sit on Peg's couch, counting the number of times the guys hit the concrete. Highly reminiscent of a classic laurel and Hardy short, ""Hog Wild (where Ollie enlists his pal to ""help"" him to connect an aerial so that his wife can ""get Japan"" - 1930). Just as in the earlier film, we expect more and more plummets to the ground and just as in '30, each fall is funnier than the previous one. It takes great direction to make a repeated sight gag work. So MWC, in my opinion, is the only sitcom (following ""The Honeymooners"") to recapture that careful blend of sharp dialogue and slapstick.

Fans of Seinfeld will especially enjoy this collection, as it features at least  three of said sitcoms' supporting cast: the actress who played ""the farmer's daughter"" in a show about Kramer and Newman getting lost on the NY thruway; the actress who played the Unemployment Office Claims Examiner daughter in the show with New York Keith Hernandez; the actor who played the Doctor who tried to revive George's fiance, at the hospital (""Calendar Girl"").

But the performances of the main cast are so strong that we cannot help getting lost in their performances. All these years later, I'm especially impressed by the work of Christina Applegate and David Faustino. I'm tempted to list all the great dialogue exchanges between Al and family and friends but I don't want to play spoiler for newcomers.

The sitcom has a certain kinship with The Honeymooners, as both male leads are a kind of TVversion of W. C. Fields; who battle with their families...but it never puts the viewer on edge, as somewhere in the crazy mix we know that love keeps 'em together. (although Al Bundy is nearly devoid of sentimentality, something Ralph Kramden lived and breathed).

A very funny entry is ""Bud Hits The Books""..but this one unfortunately should have stayed on the shelf, as the sexual subject matter is handled in a pornographic (though not *graphic*) way. I understand there is one show which was held back for a while, though I don't recll the details).

Interesting that next door neighbor, Al adversary Marcy D'arcy, Amanda Bearse, directed several episodes.",1324771200,,2822,4.840248962655601

3736800,2,B001OXLGIM,"Married with Children is one of my all time favorite series but Season 10 wasn't that good. It was still better than most shows today but compared to the first 6 seasons, the tenth season is just one in the long series of bad seasons. The jokes just aren't the same witty, decrepit, foul mouthed intelligent ones Al made in the beginning. Peggy is missing for most of the season becasue I think Katy Sagal was pregnant or something, and there was way too many episodes involving NO MA'AM, strippers and dumb blondes and Peggy's degenerate inbred family. Kelly's jokes also aren't very funny either. Whereas before she used to be genuinely ignorant and naive, now it feels kind of forced and she can't pull it off. Marcy has also become annoying and pretty much stooped to Al's level and Jefferson also lost a lot of his Gigolo charm. Overall many unfunny boring drab episodes that drag along and with the main characters missing. But I guess this is the natural course most shows go after running for that long.

Well, there is one thing I have to say about that...........LIGHTEN UP! This show is supposed to be crude, and it doesn't care if it teaches any morals! It's not like Full House or Family Matters; the show is never afraid to break any rules. Every season (except maybe the seventh, ninth, and final) contains some comic gold. This tenth season has a lot to offer. It features Pat Morita (who people can recognize as the famous Mr. Miyagi) as a Japanese businessman, a hilarious Christmas episode, a sad farewell to Buck, and, of course, the church of Al Bundy! Hallelujah! This is the second to last season of ""Married...with Children,"" and it's a little sad to know that we're approaching the end of the series. But hey, the show is hilarious, and the Bundys ROCK! So stop taking the show seriously and watch it for what it is: a sitcom that never tries to be everybody else!",1266278400,,1040,4.71978021978022

3736815,5,B001OXLGIM,"Al Bundy rules the world; let me begin with that statement. Even though at this point they had been at it for a decade, the cast continues to knock it out of the park. This season's highlights: Buck's death and reincarnation as Lucky, Peggy knocks out a thief, Bud attempts to join No Ma'am, Pat Morita wants to buy Al's Dodge, Al and Marcy have a war over a doghouse, Kelly and Jefferson star in a sexy commercial together, and Al and Jefferson have a war of practical jokes. We also get to see Al Bundy using a cell phone!
What surprised me is that there were actually one or two episodes in here that I had not seen before. When they aired, I was in the Army in South Korea, and I couldn't catch all the episodes. So seeing ""new"" (for me) episodes of Married With Children was awesome. This will probably happen on the season 11 set too.
Ahh, season 11.. I want it to come out, but then, that's it, no more. So it'll be bittersweet for me. This is hands-down the best comedy tv series ever. Not the Simpsons, not South Park, not Family Guy or any other show comes close.
I just wish, for the last dvd set, that Sony would give us back ""Love and Marriage"" as the theme music and include a few extras.. bloopers, interviews, making-of specials? Would that bankrupt Sony? Well, I can wish for my lottery numbers to come up too, I think that'll happen before Sony spends another dime on season 11. I'll miss Al Bundy's mix of lowbrow stupidity and street-wise, marriage tested wisdom.

The humor is not quite as tight as the last two seasons, but still it has moments.  The last few episodes do get a bit far-fetched.  Of couse, lovers of the series will overlook the remote plausibility episodes, such as Kelly as a scientist inventing the color ""bleen,"" and Peg's mother as a sex kitten on a porn phone line.

3736823,4,B001OXLGIM,"If you're looking for laugh-out-loud humor and outrageous family values then the outrageous Bundy Family is the right choice. ""Married... with Children"" is the long-running FOX comedy sitcom that changed our view of the typical family comedy.  The comedy series follows the lives of luckless shoe salesman Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill), his dysfunctional family and his bothersome next-door neighbors. In the tenth season, the Bundy Family is shocked when Peg's (Katey Segal) overbearing mother comes to live with them. Al and his NO MA'AM crew form a church to gain tax-exempt status. Bud (David Faustino) borrows money from the mob to finance Kelly's (Christina Applegate) exercise video. Jefferson's (Ted McGinley) anniversary surprise to Marcy (Amanda Bearse) ends badly. The tenth season marks the passing of the family pet Buck but was later reincarnated into the new family dog Lucky. The tenth season features some very enjoyable episodes with guest appearances by Tim Conway, Alan Thicke, Terry Bradshaw, Shannon Tweed, Richard Moll, Dan Novello, Ben Stein and Pat Morita. The episode ""Enemies"" was a pilot for another failed spinoff attempt from FOX.

""Married... with Children: The Complete Tenth Season"" won't win an award for best DVD presentation, but there are enough funny moments in this season to make it worthwhile. All 26 episodes of the tenth season are presented in their original full screen format. The picture quality isn't stunning but still better than your typical syndicated rerun. The 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is satisfactory. The interactive menus are simple. There are no special features included.
