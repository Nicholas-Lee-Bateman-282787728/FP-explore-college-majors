622888,5,6303321046,"This documentary moved me in more ways than one. I viewed it a while ago while attending college. It captures the true essence of street life in Seattle Washington. At the time this documentary was under production I often visited Seattle to see relatives. I was always told about the prostitution that occurred in certain parts of downtown Seattle during those days and I caught glimpses of this while riding the bus downtown. I was not aware of the huge population of adolescents that were living on the streets. Since I was so young at the time I thought most of them were just hanging out in the area. This documentary made it clear to its audience that these kids were having a day to day struggle for survival on the cruel streets where they frequently roamed. This documentary does not shelter the audience from the ugliness that occurs on the streets. It also offers the viewer a chance to get to know the kids as real people with the same hopes and dreams most kids their age possess. After getting know Erin, Ratt, Dwayne, Patty, Munchkin etc. I will never forget them. I hope there is a follow-up documentary on how their lives have turned out since the first documentary aired in 1983. I would like to know if they made it out of the grips of the streets. It's a story that happens all too often in America. It reminds us that children who are abused must have a safehouse to go to so that the streets do not appear to be an option.",1050969600,3,1444,4.432330827067669
622889,5,6303321046,"Streetwise is a compelling documentary and social study that spotlights the homeless population by focusing on adolescents.  This invocative film highlights the effects of the dissolution of the two parent family and shows the effects of such on innocent children.  Not since Paradise Lost has a film so firmly ingrained itsself in my conscience.  this film is a must see for those who appreciate the forum of the documentary and presume to be concerned with the human condition and its development.

As you experience the sad lifestyles of Erin,Lulu,Dewayne,Ratt,and the rest,you become attached to each of the street kids. You wonder what became of these young subjects after viewing the film. Mary Ellen Mark still keeps in contact with Erin. Erin has 5 children and lives in a Seattle apartment. Ratt disappeared from Seattle in late 1983,and hasn't been seen since. Patty and Munchkin broke up their relationship soon after the film was made. Munchkin is a chef in a Seattle restaurant. Lulu was stabbed in a fight in 1985 while defending a friend.

I was fortunate enough to have parents who  would take me back ,some of these kids weren't. I was 14 my friend was 15 we were  left to  sleep in the wood's alone and scared,in a big city I had never  been to. This film STREETWISE has  inspired me to make helping streetkids my  lifes work.

This documentary is just as dramatic as any work of fiction.  In fact, I just  saw a movie, also about street kids, called American Heart with Jeff  Bridges that borrows some key lines from this film.  Both movies feature  exclusive music from Tom Waits too.  Streetwise is definitely the better of  the two by far, though AH gets credit just for being so influenced by SW.  I'm a real film buff, and Streetwise is one of my favorite movies.

622946,5,6303321046,"Streetwise is a very sad documentary about the lives of

several runaways living on the streets of Seattle,Washington.

The film was made by Martin Bell,Mary Ellen Mark,and Cheryl Mccall. It was based straight from the Life magazine article

called ""Streets Of The Lost"".

 Almost every reviewer of this documentary asks what became of

these kids. The answer is often quite grim.....

 1)Dewayne Pomeroy hanged himself in July,1984,the day before his 17th birthday. Some of the street kids held a balloon release

and planted a tree in Freeway Park in his memory.

 2)Lou Ellen Couch was stabbed by a man at an arcade on 1st and

Pike street during a fight in December,1985. Her last words

were,""Tell Martin and Mary Ellen Lulu died"".....Some 319 people

attended her funeral.

 Two floor plaques at the Pike Place Market bear the names of Dewayne and Lulu.

 3)Roberta Joseph Hayes fell victim to the Green River killer

in 1987. She was last seen leaving a Portland jail. Her remains

were discovered near highway 410 around Enumclaw,Oregon in 1991.

 4)Patti died of aids.

 5)Munchkin has been working as a chef in Seattle for over 15

years now.

 6)Ratt had been incarcerated in prison for a while,and was last

reported to be driving a truck at night for a living.

 7)Shadow was last reported to be doing construction work.

 8)Kimberly is married to a navy man.

 9)Erin Blackwell now has 9 children. Two of her daughters live

with relatives. Her son,Daylon,lives on his own. Erin and her husband were reportedly planning to move to North Carolina. Mary

Ellen Mark still keeps in contact with Erin.",1152835200,32,1611,4.880597014925373
622947,5,6303321046,"Directed by Martin Bell,who directed his first feature film in 1990,the under-appreciated ""American Heart"", this 1985 academy award nominee is perhaps one the truly finest documentaries ever made. Inspired by a photo-essay for LIFE by Bell's wife,the brilliant photographer Mary Ellen Mark, ""Streetwise"" documents the daily lives of a group of throwaway kids who survive on the streets of Seattle through indomitable will to survive; there is,however,one casuality in the film - a teenage boy who committs suicide after viewing rushes of himself visiting his father in prison. His funeral becomes a point of transition in the film,which thereafter encourages the kids to react directly to the camera - not dramatising themselves,but acknowledging it's presence and the fact that the camera is now an active element in their lives,having it's own effect on their social environment. A very strange and disturbing film,oddly reminiscent of Paul Morrissey's ""Trash"" only in this case completely real. Since nobody pretends the camera isn't there - they frequently talk to it - it is questionable if ""Streetwise"" is really a documentary in the first place - or something else,a new kind of film that is totally sui generis - certainly no one has ever done anything even remotely comparable. This is one of the most unique films ever made. It could have been the start of a whole new way of making films,but Bell's later work is more along conventional fictional-narrative lines - although still quite good. But with ""Streetwise"" one ends up wondering which is better - the form or the content. In this case,both are of equal importance. These are real kids - not actors. They've just learned to adapt and accept the camera,the same way they've survived by adapting to and accepting a horrifyingly abnormal condition in life. It's nothing like ""Kids"",that's for sure. This is probably one of the best films ever made.",1141862400,6,1912,5.131410256410256
622948,5,6303321046,"""Streetwise"" is easily the best documentary ever made.  It also ranks among the finest motion pictures of all time which makes it all the more astonishing that it has never been released on DVD.  I have an old VHS copy that I taped many years ago off of cable TV and I drag it out now and again when I want to watch something incredible and compelling.  ""Streetwise"" perfectly captures a moment and place in time--namely downtown Seattle in the early 1980s.  It is a haunting and transcendent film that makes you wonder whatever became of most of these kids.  I highly recommend ""Streetwise"" and I urge whomever is holding up the release of this film on DVD to get off their butts, settle the issues, and get this film out on DVD.  There is still time, albeit not much, for a 20th anniversary release!",1132704000,6,801,4.489655172413793
622949,5,6303321046,"I originally saw this movie when it was released and shown at ""arthouse"" theatres, back in the day, and never forgot it.  Recently, I obtained a used copy off e*B*a*y, and have watched it several times.  THIS is what the film ""Times Square"" tried to capture.  THIS is what every sick hollywood director succumbing to ""directing"" scripted so-called ""reality shows"" only wish they could recreate.  This is true reality and it still goes on today- look around you: there will always be throw-away kids.  America doesn't really give a damn about the poor.  Ask President Bush. He'll tell you-  give them soup for breakfast and it'll all be fine.  What a shame.  I, like a another reviewer wondered, where are those kids today? Did any make it alive to see their adulthood?  The only one I ever heard an update on was Tiny.  Nightline did an update on her life/situation (about 1992-93?), and as you may have guessed.... she was interviewed living in a sleazy motel room with a baby... fighting with some loser she desperately wanted to keep as her man.  Kinda figured that, huh?  I recommend you get this on video until it is released on dvd, if ever.  And while you're searching for it, get your hands on the video trilogy ""The Decline Of Western Civilization (1981), ""The Decline Of Western Civilization II (1988): L.A. Metal Scene"", and ""The Decline Of Western Civilization III (1999): The Hollywood Homeless"".  These are more than just time capsules of our lives, they are reality shows unscripted for those of us who want to see the truth.",1121472000,9,1540,4.7368421052631575
622950,5,6303321046,"This is a realistic film of how it was. I lived as a street kid in Seattle in the early 80s. I was there as a runaway on the Ave and downtown. This film was actually made/filmed in 1982-83 and released in 1984.
The saddest part is the father in jail, helpless and shattered, full of regret. Great movie.",1115856000,10,303,4.1525423728813555
622951,5,6303321046,"I remember seeing the film at a special showing in Seattle when it first came out.  At that same time I was taking a monthly turn at a local shelter, down on 2nd Ave I think, bringing a meal and helping out.  I remembered Lulu, talked with her a little now and then.  This movie is the real thing.",1106784000,10,297,4.0
622952,5,6303321046,"For those who suspect this film was ""scripted"" (not surprising in the current age of irony and cynicism) -- drop by Mary Ellen Mark's website (Photographs, do a web search) and click on Books, then ""Streetwise,"" then read the preface and postscript, which reveals quite a bit more about the film.  Then think to yourself -- do you know any *professional* adolescent actors talented enough to pull off a scripted version of Streetwise?
It should dawn on you then, that Streetwise is one of a kind.  There may have been some hamming in front of the camera, but I'm fairly certain none of this was scripted.  I'm not sure what it was competing against that year at the Academy Awards, but imagine if it had won... the film would certainly still be in print (probably restored and out on DVD), and the next generation would have the opportunity to see this important work of art... also, Martin Bell would probably have gotten more work as befits his incredible talents.  As it stands, I figure this just may have been too painful to watch for Academy voters... or I wonder if they thought it was scripted too.
Anyway, this film is a ""must-see"" even if you have to buy an expensive, used copy.  Of course I may be somewhat biased... I live in and grew up in (near) Seattle, and have met the director (I was living nearby where ""American Heart"" was filmed).  Still, this is a truly unforgettable film -- it isn't easy to watch sometimes, but you'll be rewarded a hundred times over.",1076371200,5,1477,4.575757575757576

7843304,5,6303321046,"Thankfully the Germans release a number of American films no longer (or never before) pressed in the US on DVD or Blu-ray. In this particular case, the Angelika Films release has giant hardcoded [you can't turn them off] German subtitles. Is this still better than watching the movie for free on YouTube? It depends on your preference; since I can't stand low resolution video, I'm willing to put up with the subtitles.

As for the movie, it sticks with you. I saw Streetwise at an arthouse cinema in the 80s when I was an East Coast teen; it was my first exposure to the city of Seattle, where I now live. Three decades later, I still had some memory of the scenes before rewatching.
Looking into the fate of the characters this year, I was sad to find out that not long after this was filmed, Lou Ellen ""Lou Lou"" Couch was killed. The term ""superhero"" comes to mind in describing a woman who wasn't afraid of men, one who tried to defend other women from exploitation and abuse. Unlike blockbuster superheroes in the cinema who always win, she met an untimely fate. Some of the kids in Streetwise seemed like they were ""acting"" because they knew a camera was rolling; Lou Lou was genuine, and it so happened that some of this was captured on film.",1434844800,,1249,4.502202643171806

Cinematically it's very well done. At a couple points it sorta felt like the story languished, as it was going from scene to scene and person to person...but maybe that's just my ADD talking. ;).

7843308,5,6303321046,"This movie needs to be more availble to the public.  I saw it in 1985, as I was heading to Graduate School in Counseling Psychology.  I had been working @ Hale Kipa as a counselor with adolescent runaway's in a shelter on Oahu.  I said I would end up in Seattle - working with these kids.  & through a series of remarkable events, I did just that.  It poved to be one of the toughest jobs of my life.  For Sure!  They taught me a lot.  Spin the clock ahead 24 years; I saw the movie BULLY, this past weekend.  Another Must See Movie.  It reminded me of the power punch STREETWISE packed.  I'd highly recommend 'The Industry' find a way to get this movie back in the mainstream.  Our counry is struggling to find it's roots & the only way people will understand the needs of the under-privalaged & hear their cry is to see more movies like STREETWISE & BULLY.  PBS is all fine & good.  But a wider distribution of these very important documentaries is needed.  You want REALITY TV!? I'll Give You reality TV!  What do you mean 'You can't handle the Truth!' If we're not watching the truth - why watch at all?  Right?  There - I went & said it.  Please make this film more affordable & available.  Re-release it.  Thank you for every struggling child out there.  & thank you - dfrom a prfessional who strives to help them help themselves.  & a big round of applause for everyone involved in the making of this incredible documentary.

7843309,5,6303321046,"The filmmakers spending months with runaway teens on the streets of Seattle, to gain their trust and allow them to be filmed.

There is something oddly 'stagy' about some of the behavior. The kids are clearly aware of the camera. Yet, as one writer pointed out, that's
also part of the power of the film, since adolescence has so much posturing and acting out anyway.

The film tries to stay un-judgemental and avoids commentating in obvious ways, sometimes at the expense of seeming disconnected or uncomfortable voyeuristic.

Yet there are moments of tremendous power here, both in seeing these kids cling to what bits of joy they can find, and to each other, and in
seeing the grim realities of both their street and home lives, in shockingly intimate detail. A variable film, but a special, important one.

It's absurd that this important, award winning documentary has never been brought to DVD in the US.  I tried the German DVD listed on Amazon, but found the burned in German subtitles seriously distracting, and the picture quality wasn't nearly the leap up from my old laserdisc I was hoping for.",1325548800,,1106,4.830687830687831

7843311,5,6303321046,"Although this video was shot some time ago, by the famed photographer Mary Ellen Mark, the conditions are as applicable now as they were back when it was made some years ago.  This video ""Streetwise"" portays the life of several street kids in Seattle: ""Tiny"", the prostitute, who can't be any more than about 13 or 14; ""Rat"" who goes dumpster-diving for food; and Roberta Josephine (Bobbie Jo) who was eventually strangled to death by Gary Ridgway, the ""Green River Killer"", active in Seattle at that time and responsible for the deaths of many runaways in the Seattle area.

The conditions under which these kids live and survive is appalling. ""Rat"" lives in an abandoned hotel, the windows boarded up, sleeping on an old mattress on the floor.  It's chilling to think of a kid being there, though he is with an older friend. You have to wonder how terrifying their home lives must have been to make them flee like that and end up on the streets with nowhere to go, and nobody to turn to. One boy hanged himself because he couldn't stand his life anymore.

The parents of these kids are nowhere to be seen; if they are, they are completely apathetic and uninvolved in their kids' lives; their boyfriends are far more important.  This goes on as I write this; today, many kids live on the streets just as they did when this video was made.  Yet nothing is being done about it.  This video is well worth viewing; it provides an eye-opening look at the lives of these children, seen as ""throwaways"". In an age when everyone is baby-crazy, and going to any length whatsoever to have a child, it makes me wonder why some of these people don't take in foster kids and help them.  I highly recommend this video. I'm a former college professor and I showed it to a graduate class of mine three years ago; they could not stop talking about it!",1214524800,5,1835,4.522658610271903
