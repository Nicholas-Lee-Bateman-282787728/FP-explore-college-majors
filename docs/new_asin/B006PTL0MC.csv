8502899,3,B006PTL0MC,"The character and his crew are likable, but the story lines are thin at best.  Didn't watch TV back then so I don't know how representative this is of what TV series were like!",1510704000,,176,4.176470588235294

8502903,3,B006PTL0MC,"Unfortunately, I was hoping for something with more ""meet"" but was provided four short stories with our hero, Dick Powell. He gives a pretty good performance although obviously over-confident, but shows his obsession with chain-smoking throughout which sadly killed him by the age of 58.  I think the stories were a little bit too cookie-cutter clean and trite for my taste.  He was the producer so I believe he had final say in reviewing his performance which I do not think was nearly as good as in the musicals of the late 30s. Not the greatest investment.",1431129600,,559,4.752577319587629

8502905,3,B006PTL0MC,"Dated TV drama, yet enjoyable.  Powell was a better actor than many thought. But the short TV shows leave little room for story development.",1423353600,3,140,4.833333333333333
