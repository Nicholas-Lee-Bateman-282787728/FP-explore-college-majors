419535,5,6302048982,"This is Miss Crawford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperately-Seeking-Susan/dp/0792845773/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperately Seeking Susan</a>! ""Our Dancing Daughters"" is Joan's very best silent film and one of her most famous movies ever! ...And, that's no small accomplishment in a career that spanned six decades, countless reincarnations and over eighty films! I'm so excited to own this movie and to have the opportunity to tell you about it because this is one of the very first movies that turned me on to Joan's talent.

Joan plays, Diana, or Di to her friends. She's a typical roaring twenties girl. She loves to dance and party-hardy with the good ole boys. But deep down, she's really just a homebody. Ann (Miss Anita Page) is the true party animal! Both girls lust after Ben (Johnny Mack Brown, credited as John Mack Brown.) Take one guess who gets her man! This movie taught me one important lesson; anyone who screwed with the one and only Joan Crawford never won!

Most tend to forget that Joan was, at heart sincerely a dancer. She wasn't classically trained, but how many popular dancers are? Instead, Joan knew what to do because of sheer intuition and natural talent. And that only makes ""Our Dancing Daughters"" even more delicious to watch!

By the way, I wanted to let you know that ""Our Dancing Daughters"" will be on TCM on Wed., March 12th @ 7:30AM! And, if you're a fan of Joan's other feature films, you won't want to miss these, also on TCM:
The Ice Follies of 1939, March 11th @ 7:45AM

Our Blushing Brides, March 12 @ 9:00AM

The performances in this movie were all beyond perfect! Because even though it's a silent film, I can tell exactly what everyone is saying because Joan and her costars really make this movie come alive with their acting. Miss Page was absolutely excellent, too. She was so beautiful as the ""amoral"" Annikins! By the way, Miss Page is still very much alive and still answers her fan mail. Most recently, she had a small part in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Mortuary/dp/B00008G8DQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Mortuary</a>.

Here are the basics of this film:
Our Dancing Daughters (September 1, 1928) (Silent Film) (Studio: MGM)
Distributor: Turner/Warner Home Video
Runtime listing: 97 mins.
Color/BW: Black and White
(Joan played: Diana Medford)
Brief Synopsis:
A flapper sets her hat for a man with a hard-drinking wife.
Here is what Miss Crawford had to say about the movie that made her a household name (the quotes are from the book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conversations-with-Joan-Crawford/dp/0425050467/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conversations with Joan Crawford</a>:)
""Our Dancing Daughters"" was a field day for me-I think it was the first time a script department was told to write strictly for Crawford. Good Dancing, good comedy lines, good support for Johnny Mack Brown and Nils Asher. Loved every minute of it.

Here are the rest of the cast of this picture:
Nils Asther (as Norman)
Dorothy Sebastian (as Beatrice)
Edward J. Nugent (as Freddie)

This movie absolutely revolutionized the modern American film. If you don't believe me, just ask yourself this one question; how many silent movies from the twenties had sequels? ""Our Dancing Daughters"" had two sequels:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Modern-Maidens/dp/6302682541/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Modern Maidens</a>&nbsp;(from 1929, which is Miss Crawford's final silent film) and ""Our Blushing Brides"" (from 1930, which is one of Miss Crawford's first ""talkies!"") ""Our Dancing Daughters"" was also important for its time because of its honest depiction of ""loosening of youth morals."" My goodness, I can only imagine what Joan would say if she saw some of the ""loose morals"" of today's young people?

I have seen many silent feature films, but ""Our Dancing Daughters"" is second to none. Despite the fact that it's eighty years old, it still has a very youthful feel and almost a universal message. And, IMHO, the movie was way ahead of its time because the studio chose to go out on a limb and use such a risque screenplay (by Josephine Lovett.) The director was also amazing, Mr. Harry Beaumont.

Speaking of silent films, Joan appeared in over 20 silent films in under four years (between 1925-1929!) But, regrettably, the majority of her silent picture resume has never been released onto DVD (or any format, for that matter!) Here's hoping Warner Home Video (the company who holds the proprietary rights for all of Joan's feature films) will release some of these movies to the awaiting public. I'm certain that there are many fans who would love to buy these pictures. Perhaps, they could put out a boxed set with some of Joan's most popular silent films? Wouldn't that be great!

Below is a list of all of Miss Crawford's silent films that are still currently unreleased:

""From a career standpoint, Joan Crawford knew it was her story, too... And Crawford shot to stardom as the girl who, to borrow the film's title cards, 'held out her hand to grab that sunlight called life,'"" these are a few words describing this classic picture and its lead Star, Miss Joan Crawford (taken from the back of the home-video.) But it's so true, isn't it? This really is one of Joan's most famous and most important movies. I would say that Joan had 5 career-defining pictures. Besides ""Our Dancing Daughters,"" these include:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Hotel/dp/B0010DRYPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Hotel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Women/dp/B0008ENICU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Women </a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mildred-Pierce/dp/B0008ENIAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mildred Pierce </a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Ever-Happened-to-Baby-Jane/dp/B000EU1Q4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? </a>. I suppose to a lesser-extent, one could even argue that these movies were also among Joan's most influential and meaningful cinematics, as well: ""Letty Lynton,"" ""Possessed"" (from '47, of course) and perhaps even, ""Sudden Fear.""

By the way, if you're considering purchasing this movie, I do not recommend getting it from A@zon because you can find it less elsewhere. I only paid thirteen (including shipping) from half dot com!

...Some have intimated that Miss Page never forgave Joan for ""stealing her thunder."" Who knows if that's true or not? And, frankly who really cares. What I am certain of is, like a determined cat holding on to her last breath of life, Joan held on to public esteem and never let go for a split second! Remember, you can't keep a good girl down!",1204416000,2,7686,5.815275310834814
419536,4,6302048982,"Our Dancing Daughters is the epitome of a Jazz Age story complete with fashions, stars, music, dancing, and sentiments of the era. Diana (Joan Crawford) is a free-spirited girl who loves parties and whose parents don't restrain her energy; they trust her. She meets a handsome, wealthy man named Ben (Johnny Mack Brown) at a party, and the rest is history. The two fall for each other instantly. However, he is worried about Diana's nature, and is warned that it is difficult to love a woman who has ""loved"" other men. She is as virginal as they come, but Ben doesn't know this, and from her lifestyle, he assumes otherwise. He seeks solace in the arms of an elegant blonde named Ann (Anita Page) who woos Ben for his money and steals him from Diana. With great performances by Nils Asther and Edward Nugent thrown in, this is a surefire hit.

This movie is an essential silent because it represents what the 1920s were all about. Crawford dances the Charleston, the dance craze that took over America. It was also the ticket that led her to the movies; she won many prizes for her dancing talents. This film led to a series of spin-offs including Our Modern Maidens and Our Blushing Brides, which starred Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Crawford's first husband, and Robert Montgomery, a longtime screen partner. After seeing this film, you'll be itching to see those.",1184544000,,1360,4.738396624472574
419537,4,6302048982,"Wealthy and flashy Diana falls hard for Ben Blaine--who unjustly interprets her vivacity as looseness and in turn falls hard for prim and proper Anne--who is in fact a vicious gold digger with a heart of stone.  Will Ben ever see through Anne's facade and realize Diana's true worth?

Directed by Harry Beaumont with sets by the legendary Cederick Gibbons, OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS was bright, sharp, pretty to look at, and just sexy enough to make the censors fume--the type of film that MGM seemed to produce by the bushel during the late silent era.  The studio expected it to perform well, but there was no reason for anyone to think it would generate more than passing interest, much less a legendary star.  But it did.

Born in 1904, Lucille Le Sueur endured a hardknocks childhood to become a popular chorus girl in New York night spots before signing with MGM in 1925--and renamed Joan Crawford she churned out some two dozen films in three years without setting the world on fire.  Until, that is, MGM allowed her dance on table tops and despair of winning her true love in this slickly produced, well acted, but essentially formula melodrama.  And even today it is still possible to see what all the fuss was about: not only was she bursting with youthful energy and appeal, it was the first film in which Joan Crawford really LOOKED like Joan Crawford, and although still limited her acting chops weren't half bad either.

The overall cast is particularly strong, with Anita Page turning in a memorable performance as the pretty but wicked Anne and Dorothy Sebastian as Bea, a good girl with a few missed steps in her past; male leads Johnny Mack Brown, Nils Aster, and Edward J. Nugent provide solid support as various love interests; and Kathlyn Williams proves memorable as Anne's manipulative mother.  While OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS will never rival the truly great films of the late silent era, it is still a lot of fun, and those who want to see Crawford's first cinematic hurrah will not be disappointed.

419538,5,6302048982,"Joan Crawford at the time was just a girl. But,all  the more alluring. The film starts with her doing the Charleston and putting on her panties. Mind you it didn't show nudity.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the movies she is in so I decided I wanted more. Well the only other choice for me now were her silent films. I took a chance and I have to say I thoroughly loved this movie! Not for the reasons so many state(Her Charleston dance) but for her beauty, style and amazing face. The dance was ok, I certainly wouldn't have written home about it, but I suppose in its day it was good. The beauty behind her facial expressions and the way she lit up the screen made this movie what it is and the story line was fun and romantic. A great silent film with a great plot.",1389830400,2,698,4.102189781021898

419593,4,6302048982,I love the ingenue early Crawford movies. I am a movie maven. It was my baby sitter as I grew up back in the '30s. Movies were real life to me. The transition of Crawford from these light hearted parts to the more meaty grownup parts is interesting. She was very pretty in the 30's and a somewhat dancer.,1365897600,3,304,4.169491525423729
419594,5,6302048982,"Our Dancing Daughters has great acting; wow, how Joan Crawford performed in this film! She dances, communicates so much through her facial expressions (the film is almost completely silent) and does a great job of portraying how wealthy late 1920s young people liked to dress up and live it up without ever anticipating the horrifying stock market crash that was not long to come. Of course, Anita Page does an excellent job of portraying Ann, another young woman who was ""one of the crowd,"" too.

As for the plot, it moves along well without ever being boring; and it's clear who is who so that I never felt confused as to which character was doing what--and that's significant because there are quite a few actors in this film with different roles to play. The musical score with a few songs being sung off screen enhances the film; and the historic value of the film is huge as the movie not only spotlights Joan Crawford and Anita Page and even Johnny Mack Brown, the film also shows how Hollywood was phasing in sound in the late 1920s. For example, I heard a few spoken lines in addition to the off screen songs and there are sound effects like a phone ringing. Overall, the film has great historic value both for its showing how Hollywood was gradually entering the sound era and for it being the film that made Joan Crawford a truly big star.

When the story begins, we quickly meet the principle characters. Diana (Joan Crawford) is outwardly a fun loving party girl but deep down inside she is good hearted and yearns for a man to settle down with and marry. Ann (Anita Page), on the other hand, is at first blush quite sweet but it isn't long before we discover that she is extremely manipulative and thinks nothing of stealing Joan's new boyfriend Ben (Johnny Mack Brown); Ann wants to marry Ben simply because he's quite wealthy. This crushes Diana's heart and Ben himself is not too sure of what to do; but after Ann sweet talks him into believing that she's a truly beautiful human being, Ben does indeed play the fool  and he marries Ann. Meanwhile, there's an interesting subplot about Beatrice (Dorothy Sebastian) who considers herself unworthy of an untouched man because she had premarital you-know-what when she was younger. Nevertheless, Norman (Nils Asther) loves Beatrice so much that he doesn't care--as long as ""that kind of behavior"" is all in Beatrice's past.

Look also for solid performances by Edward J. Nugent as Freddie and Kathlyn Williams as Ann's mother. Dorothy Cumming and Huntley Gordon play Diana's parents.

I've already left out some plot details and I won't say more so you can enjoy this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that its value is remarkable as a film showing Hollywood's transition to sound and as a film that finally and truly made Joan Crawford a star while spotlighting Anita Page and Johnny Mack Brown! This film will entertain most if not all movie buffs; Joan Crawford fans; Anita Page fans; admirers of the other principle actors and people who appreciate silent films made during the movie industry's transition to sound.",1360800000,2,3090,4.714814814814815
419595,5,6302048982,"Why haven't they done a new version of Our Dancing Daughters is beyond me, Maybe its because this film shows how youth, privilege and beauty are still part of the drama of life. Although shot in the 20's the story is very modern, very now. Joan Crawford became a star thanks to this film and now I understand why. She was awesome!",1360108800,2,330,4.338709677419355
419596,3,6302048982,"I wanted to use a different word from ""sleazy"" in my review title but knew that the most appropriate word to describe the daughters in this movie would never get past the censors. This is the sort of amoral late 1920's film that led to the movie censorship code in the early thirties. No surprise. How sleazy is this? Very. There's no nudity or graphic sexuality, but there's plenty of racy, suggestive dialogue and innuendo.  The first half of the film is full of leers, lusty stares, and suggested hook-ups - past and present. Joan Crawford is a public wild woman, but privately, she is decent (or so the film wants us to believe. I wasn't falling for it. I think they only made her out to be this way to save the film from being banned for having no redeeming qualities). The other women, the supposed ""good and decent"" women are - of course! - hypocrites who really ARE free lovers but who want to appear decent.  The twisted morality of this film is that the whores are really the good-hearted gals while the pillar of society women are the nasty hypocrites. It's the same old claptrap being sold today in many a social issue battle and in the media: anyone trying to promote traditional morals is portrayed as a vile hypocrite while those who live amoral and sociopathic lives are depicted as cleancut, wholesome people (yeah, right). Joan Crawford looks downright mannish (I want to use another word here, but THAT word won't get past the censors either). She gives a very spirited performance as a flapper, but her masculine looks make me wonder how she ever made it in Holllywood (wait - don't tell me, I can guess). What you get here is the 1920's version of a Jaqueline Susann/Jackie Collins novel. It's very trashy, very (and surprisingly) racy, and very disposable. Junk food on film. Lots of bitchiness, young people in rut, wealth, wild parties, etc. It may be one of the wildest silent movies ever made. But is it good? No. It's a film that is only memorable because of its raciness. Other than that, it's garbage. It pushes the boundaries, but to no particular purpose except to bring 'em in at the box office. A curiosity and nothing more. And this print is not a very good one. Several scenes are distracting because of the pieces of hair on the print. It does have an orchestral score that sounds like it was done on Vitaphone. For hard core silent film buffs, Crawford fans, and fans of trashy films.",1336694400,,2421,4.576036866359447

It is a brief segment of Joan Crawford's feet jittering ultra rapidly, and most of it is viewed from the knees down!  I would never even guessed it was a Charleston - if in fact it was intended to be?  However, I found the film fascinating for two reasons.  First - it is a visual treat.  You see the 1920's upper class youth in great high style art deco sets, and a great view of high style 1920's and art deco fashion in everything from clothing, interior decoration, set design, etc.  The second reason is that I thought the movie was a fascinating look at a late-in-the-period silent movie.  The disk has the original accompanying ""sound track"" - full of great period music and appropriate sound effects.  Virtually the only thing that is lacking is the actual spoken dialogue itself - perhaps still not able to be synchronized properly to the actors speaking.
