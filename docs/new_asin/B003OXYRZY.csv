8401756,1,B003OXYRZY,"This film was more about the film maker than the artist. His physical presence on screen was distracting and unnecessary. John Marin was a significance artist, deserving of an appropriate homage. This 90 minute, torturous lecture exhausted me. I was one of a few still awake when it ended. I would have left after the first 20 minutes if I hadn't been sitting in the front row of the screening. I have spoken with others about the film. They concur. Look elsewhere for enlightenment.",1281830400,6,483,4.761904761904762
