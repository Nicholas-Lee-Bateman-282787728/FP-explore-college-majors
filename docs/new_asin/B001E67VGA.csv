8296612,3,B001E67VGA,"There is much here. The Civil War videos were good, as they take the viewer through the war with re-enactments and photos. Fair, even-handed and informative, as well as entertaining.

The World War I portion was easily the WORST of the lot. It had a chance to be very good, but they employ a narrator who clearly was over his head with this assignment. If you want to describe the First World War, you had better be comfortable pronouncing the names of French, Russian and German generals and statesmen, as well place names. If not, get some help with people who do. I found myself getting constantly distracted with the awful mis-pronunciations, and that made it hard to enjoy the films, which otherwise actually included some great footage. (Maybe I should listen with the sound turned down?)

The World War II discs were clearly the best. I'll take off a few points for the propaganda, but the footage was spectacular, and many included some very useful maps and diagrams which helped understand some of the progress of the war, especially on the Pacific side.

Both the Korea and Vietnam films were marred by the fact that they were all made by the government, and (like WWII) made contemporary to the war. But once again, some great footage, and there was much to be both informative and entertaining.",1369958400,,1306,4.744493392070485
