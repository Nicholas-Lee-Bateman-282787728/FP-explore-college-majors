3904817,5,B002C7ELOA,"If you love westerns, you'll love Laramie, the Final Season.
Just in time for the show's 5oth anniversary, fans are treated to thirty-two full color western adventures featuring heroes/buddies Slim Sherman (played by John Smith) and Jess Harper (played by Robert Fuller), who together run a ranch and stagecoach relay station in Wyoming. This classic western aired for four seasons, 1959/60-1962/63.
Filled with action, a touch of humor, a wonderful cast with superb chemistry, great supporting characters (housekeeper Daisy Cooper, orphan Mike Williams, Sheriff Mort Cory, driver Mose and more), and a first class group of guest stars (including some of the best villains in the business like LQ Jones and Jan Merlin): Laramie hits the target dead center for westerns.
Season Four contains some of the series best episodes, especially for fans of Mr. Fuller as Jess Harper, the iconic loner/gunfighter who finds a fresh start and a makeshift family at the Sherman Ranch.
I watched this show as a young child, and was delighted at how well it's held up over five decades.
Although this set doesn't have any bonus interviews like that of Mr. Fuller in the Season Three DVD set, it's still a delightful return to the heydey of the western, and a TV series many consider the best of the genre.

3904850,3,B002C7ELOA,"Having purchased all four seasons, I opted to start viewing the final season (for no specific reason other than to start enjoying Laramie again, where viewing them in season order didn't seem terribly important).  In all fairness, I haven't yet viewed the intial three seasons yet, but have to say thus far, I'm a bit disappointed in the video quality from the final season I've just finished viewing..  My view may change for the better or worse, once I've viewed all four season releases.  Certainly, the final season episodes are viewable but nonetheless, still disappointing and at this point, I question the price of this final season for that reason alone, which I think is a tad bit too high.  I have viewed a great many Laramie episodes on the GRIT channel which seem to be of slightly higher quality, but again, that's my perception.  To be fair, Timeless Media does present a disclaimer in advance that to their knowledge, they have used the best sources available, so what can one say?  Perhaps my expectations were simply too high after having been spoiled by other oldie shows of that era which were far superior in quality -- I suppose we fans simply have to remind ourselves that not all of our favorites shows were preserved as well as we might have hoped for.  So, being spoiled too much sometimes has its downsides, lol...  I think it might be unfair to be too critical of Timeless Media.  While I have experienced a few disc lockups while viewing the final season,  I'm not willing to prematurely blame this on manufacturing or disc quality until after I've viewed the remaining three seasons (because it's equally possible that my Magnavox disc player, which was only a 40 dollar investment (which has proven to be a good one, by the way), is just getting tired.  Overall, I enjoy the show, the scripts and the entire cast - it's nice to re-enjoy these shows despite my disappointment (and expectations) over quality.  Just don't set your expectations too high because these color episodes do seem a bit faded and the sharpness simply isn't there.  Kinda like watching shows that were from a vhs tape, if that's a fair comparison to make..  If you're a fan as I am, it's still worth having (since most of us are completists anyways) and I'm still going to rate it middle ground, with three stars.",1461196800,10,2316,4.7004950495049505

3904874,1,B002C7ELOA,"This review is purely for the video quality of this set. The show itself was a solid show with 2 solid starring characters, fine story lines, and excellent guests, some of them legendary. The show itself ranks around 3 to 4 stars out of 5. This review, however, is for the embarrasing video quality of this set, probably ranking 5 stars out of 10, a grade of F. In this age of Bluray, who would want to play this set, the terrible video quality hurts the eyes to watch. I am a collector of thousands of tv shows, and I would say that this is the worst retail issue I have ever seen. If you can buy this set cheaply buy it, it is worth having to have a look at this classic show, but I am sorry to say, you will only view it once because of the terrible quality.",1437782400,3,761,4.046357615894039

3904876,5,B002C7ELOA,Loved all 4 seasons of Laramie,1433980800,,30,4.166666666666667
3904877,3,B002C7ELOA,"They had a great formula but did not stick to it. First let me say that they kept it family oriented to the last episode. The way they did that was to keep the boy and mother hen played by Spring Byington in each story. The formula of the buddy/team worked perfectly. However, they did not stick to this formula as I have mentioned in other reviews, they varied from it often not even having the other major characters make any form of an appearance at all. Or, they would make a brief appearance in the beginning and/or end of the story and not during the major parts of the story. The stories switch off between the two major characters. The packaging was better for this season, but I suspect that was more of a hit or miss thing on my part, and not the doing of TMG. Hence the 3 stars. Four stars for the stories overall. They are well written and though they seem repetitive at times they do hold the attention of the viewer. Five stars for the stories that have both main characters throughout the story and not just in part of it. I would not call this the best season, but I would call it a good season. I feel that the best season was season 1 with Hoagie Carmichael in it. After that the series seemed to go gradually downhill, and they just never recaptured the glory they had in that first season. Both Robert Fuller and John Smith are amazing actors and went on to do some wonderful television. I am starting Wagon Train a series that Robert Fuller joined after he left Laramie, I will see you all when I finish season 1 and review it.

Robert Fuller made my day and was fantastic as the volatile Jess Harper the perfect role for Fuller, John Smith perfect as Slim Sherman, best duo on TV. Just sad this was the final season and no more to order. If you liked Laramie, order this to finish your set. Though sad to see it end, its worth it.

3904886,5,B002C7ELOA,"I just purchased all four seasons of Laramie and have wanted them for 4 years now. I had previously downloaded them from YouTube and the quality from YouTube was horrible.  I was worried when I read the reviews about the bad video and audio quality and after suffering through extremely terrible videos of Laramie for 4 years, I was thrilled when I put the DVD in my Playstation and pressed play, I could actually see Robert Fullers face clearly.  The video quality was 100 times better. Yes, there is some minor quality issues but that often occurs with all the old shows I have received.  People who except 1080dpi quality from an old show will be disappointed.  Those of us who know better will be thrilled with what we have gotten. I have collected shows such as Trackdown & Johnny Ringo, which were never put on VHS or DVD so you accept any quality of video you can get.  You just want to preserve the history and the sheer joy of the show. Once these show does become available on DVD,  I purchase it. My love for westerns and the appreciation for the work it takes to restore them, means that we should realize we will never get perfection.  I will agree that they could box the DVD's better. Both my Season 2 and my Season 3 were loose and easily fall out of its holders. I also purchased ""The Deputy"", ""The Tall Man"", and""The Restless Gun"" at the same time and they all came in good packages and in excellent condition.",1414713600,8,1428,4.427480916030534

TV sets weren't plentiful for us back then. Now I get to view the entire series. True old west flavor, great writing and direction, family value stuff.
The reason I picked 4 stars is because of the picture quality. It appears as bad copies of VHS tape. Certainly wished they would have remastered one of the best western series on TV. However, it is still enjoyable.",1397433600,2,521,4.381443298969073

3904893,5,B002C7ELOA,"To say that I was raised on westerns (John Wayne, etc.) would be an understatement. While I was not a fan of Gunsmoke, it was watched without fail in our household of one TV. Laramie was one of my favorites,  not because the plots were memorable, but because who could resist Robert Fuller as Jess Harper the somewhat rebel to a person who wanted to be, but by convention could not be nor had the guts to deviate from that which was expected. Watching the series again brought back memories and I have to admit that  were pleasant. It reminded me of a time when things were left to one's imagination. Worth watching again to remember how TV was and sadly where it has gone today (reality TV is definitely not something I would watch or support). Most of us knew this was fiction and that the actors were more of less skilled in their craft.",1393632000,2,840,4.378205128205129

3904896,5,B002C7ELOA,"I own all 4 seasons of Laramie.  It was a show I enjoyed when it first was telecast from 1959 to l963.  It is now a show I have re-discovered!  Laramie came to TV during the age of telecast westerns.....easily one of the best ever made!  The stories were typical.....good guys, bad guys, robberies, pretty girls, fights, conflicts, stagecoach hold-ups.......the ingredients for any good western.  Westerns, of course, need heroes.  And, this show had two of them...in addition to great stories, good supporting casts, and great guest stars.  The two heroes were friends.....a relationship that tied together this series in a terrific way.  John Smith and Robert Fuller were perfectly cast, and their role relationship was the backbone that made this series work.  I truly believe no one could have played Jess Harper better than Robert Fuller.....or Slim Sherman played by John Smith.  They fit each other...and played off each other so well...that one could believe their characterizations were genuine....it was said they were good friends off the screen as well!  Great series always seem to have that one necessary ingredient.....The working relationship between the main characters working successfully in every respect.  When the two worked together in the story, the series was at its best.  The main mistake made later in the series was having stories with only one of the stars.....the other minimally used.  Gone was the camaraderie they shared.  That story sharing provided a strength.....the story separation provided a weakness!

3904898,3,B002C7ELOA,"I can't believe Laramie came to an end with the fourth season.  You see Laramie is an amazing family western with simply two of the best leads ever in John Smith and Robert Fuller.  It could have gone on for a few more years. Thankfully the series has managed to get released by TMG for years to come.  If you enjoy the big westerns like Gunsmoke, Rawhide, The Virginian and Bonanza you have to give this series a try.

So how does the 4th season release stack up to previous releases.  Sadly there is barely any improvement to the 4th season set over the third.  The color is faded, the picture is grainy and not sharp at all, and the sound is incredibly muffled.  The picture does appear to be a slight bit better than the third season but it's still less than ideal.  You may think I am being harsh but compare season 4 of Laramie vs the picture quality of the first season of the Virginian.  Debuting the same year you'll see what I mean.  The Virginian's picture is sharp, clear and the sound is great.  Laramie not at all.  Again it has that worn video tape quality to it and it's a real tragedy.  Overall the black and white seasons of Laramie are of a better quality than the color.  I hope someday somehow this series is totally remastered if even possible.  I'm not sure if film exists to enable a full restoration but it deserves it.

So now that I've blasted the quality of the release should you buy it.  YES!!!  These series are national treasures of a past in television when the whole family could watch a series together.  They are strong morality tales that deserve to be cherished for years to come.  And you should celebrate actors like John Smith and Robert Fuller for their contributions to television.  While I want to give it 5 stars because of this, I would be doing a disservice to Amazon community, so sadly the most I can give it is a 3.  Still,support Laramie and purchase and enjoy it even in the less then stellar quality.  Someday we may be able to get the release this deserves but until then enjoy what we have and be thankful for it.",1376092800,3,2068,4.356020942408377
3904899,4,B002C7ELOA,"HI, I liked this wester series as the stories were well written and I liked the actors on the show. I do wish the two male actors had been together in more of the espoisdes. I liked the color and all the seasons should have been in color. The only thing about these is some of the espoides they were not as sharpe in the images as they should have been. But they tell you at the start of the disk that they had a very hard time finding all the esposides and that some of the images would not be the best in the world. I have the second season also and will get the other ones as money permits.",1375660800,3,593,3.909090909090909

3904902,5,B002C7ELOA,"I loved all the westerns when I was young and that was way before videos were invented, so we just had to see them when they were on.  Laramie was probably my favourite and it's great to be able to get this copy finally.  Disappointing that they don't seem to be releasing the whole series, as I have been unable to get 3.",1362614400,2,322,4.095238095238095
3904903,5,B002C7ELOA,"As a series go, I love Laramie so my high rating is for the series itself. If you are expecting a product that gives you the quality of HD tv then forget it. You will be buying this product purely for the love of the TV show. I am a diehard fan so I am just grateful that it was released on DVD at all. From what I've been told the original films of season 3 and 4 were never found so Timeless had to rely on what they could source through VHS tapes that fans had or any other means they could find. Don't quote me on exactly how they got their copies, but they do make an apology on the DVDS for the less than perfect quality. I knew this from other fans before I purchased this set and while it is disappointing not having the episodes in perfect condition, you are still able to view the show and be thoroughly entertained.",1361664000,5,826,4.0426829268292686

3904905,5,B002C7ELOA,"Laramie was the best, yes, the BEST, western show ever made!!  It was far more realistic than the others, had great plots and great acting and was very reliable entertainment.  It is a mystery to me why it only managed four season when stupid old Bonanza went forever!  Just another example of a great show falling victim to shortsighted audiences and producers with more money and power than sense.",1358553600,11,399,4.753623188405797
3904906,5,B002C7ELOA,I really enjoy looking at Laramie.  It is an exciting western that is very well written.  It is always a pleasure to go back in time and watch this show.  I was a small child when it was on television.  I really like the western tv series of the 50's and 60's.  I recommend this DVD.,1358467200,2,283,3.982142857142857

3904909,5,B002C7ELOA,"Okay, the obvious: These episodes don't look, nor do they sound so good. Apart from that, I have nothing but good things to say about this series.

Other than it's very strange and messy release order:

1st: Season 3
2nd: season 4
3rd: Season 1
4th: Season 2

And if that's not enough, the 3rd season isn't even called by it's name, it's: Laramie - In Color Part 1. And when Timeless Media decided to release Part 2, they threw the title out and called it, ""The Final Season."" Confusing!

But, now that I do have this entire series and have viewed them in chronological order, I could care less in how they released them. For that matter, even the lousy quality of some of the episodes I've dismissed. Hell, I used to watch on a small screen with really bad reception as a kid. I am just grateful that I've had the opportunity to see this series, since I was too young to even remember it when it on the air. Nope, not the best acting, and some of the stories were pretty weak, but in the long run, this was a very enjoyable series that was deserving of it's four season run. A good wholesome family show that has been brought back for a whole other generation, or two to enjoy again. Thanks Timeless Media!",1357084800,4,1207,4.3039647577092515

3904911,4,B002C7ELOA,"The color is much better than the black and white.  We like to say thing like ""that was a rukus"" for a fight or when either Slim or Jake has an episode where they go on a trip that it's a ""whirlwind adventure"".

I was lucky as Amazon have now fully refunded me the prurchase cost of Laramie: The Final Season and I have suggested to them that they withdraw this product from sale as I am sure that any buyer will not be happy with it.",1321660800,30,643,3.9844961240310077

3904919,5,B002C7ELOA,"One could say if you are a Laramie fan, you couldn't wait until Universal Studios or Timeless Media Group would release this wonderful 1960's western on DVD.  However, in reading some of the comments, there may be a few issues with some of the Laramie episodes playing right on your DVD player from both seasons.  I understand that Laramie was filmed on 35mm film (16mm film for TV Stations)  back in the 1960's when they didn't have all this fancy equipment the studios have now to film in high definition etc..  I think Timeless Media Group did the best they could in providing the Laramie television show on DVDs.  At least, we have the opportunity to see this wonderful western again after 50 years.  Hang in there!  And hopefully Universal Studios will bring this 1960's television show back to life again !!!  Until then, thanks TMG for Laramie Season 3 and 4 !!!",1269388800,3,869,4.633986928104576

3904921,5,B002C7ELOA,"I was unfamiliar with Laramie until a friend shared this show with me. Robert Fuller started as a stuntman on westerns and then branched into acting. For those fans of his familiar with Emergancy! you will be in for a wonderful treat to see him as Jess. Unlike other westerns were you wonder how the actors are staying on the horse Robert can really ride, also when the horse falls it's really him on it. The show shows its age in picture quality, and its portrayal of indians but overall the scripts are well crafted.",1269216000,6,518,4.463157894736842
3904922,2,B002C7ELOA,My wife purchased this for me for Christmas and we just got around to viewing the first episode last night. One reason I wanted this set was it was in color but the colors are very faded/ washed and the sound quality is terrible also. I have black and white DVD sets from older shows than this that are much better quality. The price for this was way too much for the quality; this is very disappointing.,1265932800,51,404,4.259740259740259
3904923,1,B002C7ELOA,well the production house ensured that they packaged the best series without any remastering and gave you GARBAGE .They should be sued for murdering such a beautiful tv western.
