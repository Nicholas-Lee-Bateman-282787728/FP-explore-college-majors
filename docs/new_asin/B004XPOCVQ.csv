8447408,5,B004XPOCVQ,"Bringing home Iris The Happy Professor Vol 3 DVD, I was certain my 3 year old daughter would jump at the chance to watch it with me. I was a bit surprised (but definitely not deterred) when she took one look at it and said, ""There's no fairies or princesses, mom!"" Immediately I brought my 2 year old son into the process and gained his excitement in watching a new DVD! Win!

It didn't take long before both of my kiddos were happily watching Iris The Happy Professor Vol 3 DVD! My daughter loved the characters as well as the topics covered. My son bounced along with the cute songs. I had two immediate approvals for the new DVD!

Iris The Happy Professor Vol 3 DVD contains five episodes that cover Seasons, Fruits and Vegetables, Hot and Cold, Nature, The Earth and the Sky, and Minerals. The characters are all adorable puppets that do a great job at making learning fun.

With a total running time just under an hour and a half, I found it perfect for distracting my kids while I accomplish a few tasks around the house but at the same time giving my kids something more than mindless cartoons to watch.

We all love Iris The Happy Professor and will be looking for more of these DVDs in the future!",1359331200,,1206,4.370535714285714
