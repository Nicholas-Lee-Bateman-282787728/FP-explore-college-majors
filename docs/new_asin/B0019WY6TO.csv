8275432,4,B0019WY6TO,"This video centers around the Taliban in Pakistan.  It is mostly video footage of their activities and interviews with people who either sympathize with them or are opposed to them.

When the Taliban speak for themselves they are often followed by clips of them in action which can be quite brutal.  If you don't have some background in the history of the Taliban and who was involved in funding them you can get some very biased opinions from the video.  But if you do know about how the Pakistani ISI was involved in founding and funding the Taliban and is considered by many western intelligence agencies to still be supporting them, the interviews with former ISI officials take on a new light.

I gave the video a high rating because it allows you to see what the locals in that area have to say on the subject with very little editorializing.  I found that to be a valuable way to see the subject.  If you want a video that will interpret the Taliban for you, you'll rate this video very low.",1289001600,,998,4.480662983425415
