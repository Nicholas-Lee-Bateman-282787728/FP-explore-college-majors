8013031,4,B0001I2C02,Some of the music is outstanding.  You will like the production.,1525305600,,64,4.818181818181818
8013032,4,B0001I2C02,This is an extremely entertaining performance.  All the characters are wonderful and so right for their roles.  My only complaint is they shortened Frosh's role to next to nothing and I've always enjoyed the actor who gives a new interpretation to this wonderfully comic role.  It has been updated with beautiful costumes and a trememdous revolving set which is a subtle suggestion of a jail all the way through the opera.  I think almost anyone would enjoy this beautiful and clever production.,1219017600,2,495,5.0
8013033,5,B0001I2C02,"There is not much that I really wish to add to the reviews already printed here; the quality of the recording (both audio and video) is extremely good and the performances from all of the singers especially Pamela Armstrong as Rosalinde, Lyubov Petrova as Adele and Thomas Allen as von Eisenstein make this a truly ensemble work. The conducting of the London Philharmonic by Vladimir Jurowski was extremely exciting to listen to, and hearing his comments in the Special Features section was most informative. The fact that perhaps not too many people have seen the comic side of Thomas Allen is their misfortune as, from 1969 to 1972 when Mr. Allen was a member of the Welsh National Opera, I was able to see quite a few of his performances. When he appeared as Figaro in The Barber of Seville or Papageno in The Magic Flute, his enthusiasm and sense of comedy made these roles the highlight of the season.
I agree wholeheartedly with all of Mr. Morrison's comments concerning the costumes, acting, choreography and updating the performance to the start of the last century and my only disappointment was that when the stage rotated from Rosalinde's house to the Villa Orlofsky there seemed to be very little change. The stage director obviously liked the set as he rotated it a number of times, with ever diminishing returns, during the work. To see how a revolving stage would enhance a performance of Die Fledermaus, check the DVD of the 1986 Munich Opera performance conducted by Carlos Kleiber, with a production designed by Otto Schenk, which drew applause from the audience when the exterior of the ballroom revolved to show the inside. Both sides of the stage were extravagantly opulent but completely different.

Although I could drop a star because of the slight disappointment with the stage set, the overall production certainly warrants five stars.",1218758400,5,1861,4.926751592356688
8013034,5,B0001I2C02,"First and foremost; great sound quality. The acting and singing are fine; all the singers are very strong. Purists may object to the absence of the exploding stove gag in the last act, but I didn't miss it.

I couldn't figure out whether this one was lip snyc'ed or used parabolic mikes. I'd guess the latter, but the sound quality was so good it's hard to believe.

It was performed before a live audience with applause in all the right places. Really gives the feeling of being in the theater.

Make sure you play it on a really good sound system.",1184803200,2,549,4.415841584158416
8013035,5,B0001I2C02,"I'm not going to compare it with other versions of this operetta, but I must say that you will enjoy a lot this dvd(You will watch it over and over... and over), the singing, the customes, the staging, and the dancing are the best and the orchestra did an exellent work(Bravo!!!) exellent video and audio quality. Extra Features: Cast Interviews/Genesis of Waltz and more... GREAT PRODUCTION!",1094083200,7,392,4.954545454545454
8013036,5,B0001I2C02,"I first saw this in the unflattering surroundings of in-flight entertainment on Singapore Airlines and was so impressed I bought the DVD.  The music and staging are wonderful - but, above all, this is very funny and very engaging.  Sir Thomas Allen shows a comic timing I was unaware of and Pamela Armstrong gives a wonderfully ballsy performance.  And surely no-one has ever been so BORED as Malena Ernman as Prince Orlofsky?  This is a real treat which treats the text with suitable irreverance and the piece as an enjoyable operetta, not a delicate work of art.",1092700800,7,564,4.783505154639175
8013037,3,B0001I2C02,"This is a reasonably good production and video recording of Die Fledermaus, but it is definitely not as good as the 1987 Bavarian State Opera production available from Deutsche Grammophon (and Amazon).  It's not so much that anything about this production is actually bad, it's more that this production never rises to the level of brilliance of that earlier production.
The principals are generally comparable musically, although Pamela Armstrong does not compare well in her acting with Pamela Coburn in the role of Roselinde.  Likewise, Wolfgand Brendel (Falke), the late Eberhard Wachter (Eisenstein), and Brigitte Fassbaender (Orlofsky) all have the edge over their respective counterparts, Haken Hagegard, Malena Ernman, and Sir Thomas Allen (certainly all accomplished singers).
Somehow, this production just doesn't have the spark of enthusiasm that the Staatsoper one does.  This ranges from the shots of Carlos Kleiber grinning away as he conducts, to the marvelous set for Act 2, to the generally much funnier spoken dialogue.  (In the usual operetta tradition, each production goes its own way with the spoken parts.)
I have them both, and find it rewarding to compare them.  But if you only want one, go with DG.",1084838400,14,1225,5.293814432989691
8013038,5,B0001I2C02,"This new release comes from last summer's new production of 'Die Fledermaus' at Glyndebourne, the first ever at that bucolic English opera house. I can happily report that it is first-rate in all respects. The production is helped by the cutting-edge facilities of the new Glyndebourne Opera House built in the 1990s; the ingenious and striking revolving stage setting is a marvel. The story has been updated by about thirty years - to about 1900 - in order to subtly emphasize the sexual subtext of the characters' behavior, something not so easily done in the original 1870 setting and with the original text. The text, too, has been updated - in German - and the score is a new critical edition of the Strauss's 1874 score, and it is played complete except for one very minor cut. The cast is superb. As I write this review Amazon has not included the cast list, so I shall do so:
Alfred - P&auml;r Lindskog
Adele - Lyubov Petrova
Rosalinde - Pamela Armstrong
von Eisenstein - Thomas Allen
Dr. Blind - Ragnar Ulfung
Dr. Falke - Hakan Hagegard
Frank - Artur Korn
Prince Orlofsky - Malena Ernman
Frosch - Udo Samel
Ida - Ren&eacute;e Sch&uuml;ttengruber
The London Philharmonic is conducted by very talented young (32) conductor (and the LPO's new principal guest conductor), Vladimir Jurowski. (And in case you wondered, yes he is the son of conductor Mikhail Jurowski.) The director is Stephen Lawless, who has done a wonderful job of underlining the the hypocrisies of the fin de si&eacute;cle Viennese middle class. It's not for nothing, he says in an interview included on the DVD, that the operetta is named 'The Bat,' as it shows the after-dark behavior of the bourgeoisie. In his interlude before the beginning of Act III, German actor Udo Samel as Frosch gives the operetta a new subtitle, 'Baritones Behaving Badly.'  (Of course, the other reason for its name is that the deus ex machina of the plot is the sly Dr. Falke [Ger. 'Falcon,'] who dresses as a bat at the fancy dress ball of the Act II.)
The costumes are gorgeous, the dancing spectacular, the sets sumptuous. The singing, I have to say, is the equal of the starry cast of the te Kanawa/Prey/Domingo Covent Garden DVD from 1983. And it makes the recent Euro-trashy production from Salzburg even less desirable than it already was. (Go read my review of that DVD for more details of that travesty.) The acting of the singers - all of whom LOOK the part - is subtle and convincing. I would single out the acting of mezzo Malena Ernman, as the epicene Prince Orlofsky, quite the most convincing jaded young aristocrat I've ever seen; she sings well, too, and even in her singing she sounds so, erm, bo-o-ored. . It was good to see veterans Ragnar Ulfung and Hakan Hagegard singing wonderfully as Blind and Falke. Thomas Allen, who continues to be one of the most talented bass-baritones around, is superb as Eisenstein; he showed a comic side I'd never seen before. P&auml;r Lindskog, a tenor not previously known to me, is suitably narcissistic as the singing teacher, Alfred, but occasionally he is a bit under pitch. As to the two main ladies - Armstrong and Petrova - I have nothing but raves for their performances, singing and acting. Petrova gets the most out of her soubrette role and Armstrong plays and sings the not-so-pure Rosalinda with zest and a rich sound.
The extras: Subtitles in English and Spanish. The production is entirely in German except for the spoken interlude in English by Udo Samel as Frosch. Options for stereo or surround sound audio. Pictures of the cast, of the drawings for the costumes and sets. A short interview with the architects of the new Glyndebourne, with a tour of the house and picture of the old house. A short piece about the Viennese waltz. Interviews with Lawless, Armstrong, Allen, Hagegard and Jurowski. The latter illustrates points from the score at the piano.
A triumph for all concerned. A hearty recommendation.
2 DVDs: Total time of the operetta 159 mins. Extras: 35 mins.
