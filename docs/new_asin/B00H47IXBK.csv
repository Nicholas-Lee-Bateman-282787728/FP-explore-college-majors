6131381,2,B00H47IXBK,"Aside from Rutger Hauer I had to ask myself Why I was watching this. Based on an obscure GN this piece of work was a real piece of crap. Most notably was the sound editing, it was nonexistent. Within the first 5 minutes of the film you cannot understand or hear a single word the priest and Rutger are saying. its just a room full of echoes and mumbling. The rest of the film stumbles along without much of a point or reasoning. Skip it!!",1401062400,4,438,4.1647058823529415
6131382,2,B00H47IXBK,"I actually would have given this 3 stars, but the high ratings others have given this straight to dvd film bothered me--another obvious case of someone with a self interest fluffing a film. I really hate that.

The makers even added a bit of ' priest fan service'.

If you have no social life, live alone, and are into goth you might like this film. The rest of us might watch a few minutes out of curiosity, but not even beer and pizza can make this a good watch.",1399593600,,464,4.202247191011236
6131383,4,B00H47IXBK,See what happens when #TheReverend assigned to an English village is turned into a blood-thirsty vampire and dedicates himself -- and the use of his newfound powers -- to cleaning up the evil doers in his town.  Plenty of gore to go around and the presence of Rutger Hauer (HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN) is always welcome!!,1392681600,9,314,4.607142857142857
6131384,5,B00H47IXBK,"This a movie nearly on a par with The Exorcist or Alien. A green young reverend (Anglican or Methodist) is assigned to a small, remote parish. He soon undergoes some horrifying events that he interprets as a modern-day but of course supernatural version of Job's test from the Old Testament.",1389225600,5,291,4.84

8629752,5,B00H47IXBK,"honestly, i thought this would be a lot different.  you have to keep an open mind, but in the end its actually a decent vampire movie.  i wouldn't call this a horror movie by any means, somewhat gory but thats about it.  it does take a little bit for things to pick up, but i personally enjoyed the end result.  its also not a traditional vampire movie either.  its nothing like ""priest"" different.  its just...kinda small scale.  theres really nothing special about the vampires in this movie, but again you just need an open mind.",1436140800,,532,4.536842105263158

8629760,3,B00H47IXBK,"This movie was interesting.  I give it kudos for a different interpretation of the overused vampire theme, a vampire with a conscience.  It was an entertaining way to spend an evening.

While I enjoyed it and would even watch it again, It doesn't reach the level of great movie.  If you like the vampire genre but want to see something other than just evil killing innocents, it would be worth checking out.  Don't expect to much, and you will have an enjoyable evening.",1404000000,,470,4.614457831325301
