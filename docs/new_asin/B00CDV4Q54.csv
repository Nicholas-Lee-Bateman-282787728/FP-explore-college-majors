5716827,5,B00CDV4Q54,Ian and the various boys at their best. Loved it! Seeing the different lineups and the ever better musicianship is a musical treat.,1374796800,,131,4.739130434782608
5716828,4,B00CDV4Q54,"Not as much old stuff as I would have liked. Some of it is re-packaged concerts. The new stuff is high quality. If you are not aware of Ian's loss of voice over the years, you may be disappointed with the latter material. Real fans will appreciate.",1374105600,2,248,4.297872340425532
5716829,5,B00CDV4Q54,"The benefit of this collection is that, for the first time, it combines extended live performances from throughout Jethro Tull's long career in a single package.  It is true that a small proportion of the material, the Isle of Wight footage, has appeared on a prior commercial release.  The remaining performances, however, are presented here, in a LEGITIMATE, ARTIST-APPROVED release, for the first time.  The quality of the DVD is better than you'll get from illegal bootlegs or on the internet.  The book that comes with it is a pleasant, added bonus.  My only quibble is that I think it would have been a better product if it had included some live performances by Ray Davies.  But, that nit aside, I believe you will find this reasonably-priced, thoughtfully-crafted collection is well worth it.",1373760000,,800,4.977443609022556

He is a genius
His music is still relevant exciting and fun
I wish I was there
keep going",1373068800,,99,4.0
5716831,5,B00CDV4Q54,"Kudos to Eagle for such a fine compilation.
Now we need the Sao Paulo, Brazil 2000 show that was recorded by Direct TV Brazil to be released.",1372982400,2,141,4.2592592592592595
5716832,1,B00CDV4Q54,"This is weak! I'm as big a Tull fan as any, but this purchase was merely a charitable donation to the Ian Anderson college fund. I cannot believe they released this based on the film quality. You mean to tell me no other better footage exists than this? Or will that be released down the road as the definitive JT live video for another $40. The best part was probably the 1970 Isle of Wight and that was previously released and purchased. You can tell this was put together in a hurry to capitalize on JT's faithful fans who will buy anything they put out. This presentation as a whole gives the impression that it was done by amateurs. If footage is too bad, scrap it and use something else. I'm sure fans across the world have better video of vintage Tull and that shouldn't happen. The only redeeming quality is the essay that they call ""a book"". Really. I wont' get fooled again. Since they apparently have nothing left to offer via vintage video and I absolutely know they are finished studio album wise, this will be my last Tull purchase. For those of you waiting for Blu-ray, don't waste your time. Blu-ray can't save this. You can't polish a turd!",1372809600,31,1157,4.462264150943396
5716833,5,B00CDV4Q54,"I have watched 3 of the 4 and read about 20 pages. its great to see them go from 1070 to 2003 (the last DVD is from 2005) . and to see how the recording quality is so much beter now, cant say enough about it but as you can guess I love Jethro Tull",1372636800,,247,3.5090909090909093
5716834,1,B00CDV4Q54,"As a long time fan of the group (1968) I own all Tull media. I hope this review saves many a lot of frustration...it is only meant as a BENEFIT to those that expect cleaned up re-remasters from the boot sources most of these performances were taken from.
This four DVD compilation is complied from boots long available through the TULL grapevine. Eagle's recompilation from these boots are no better visually or sonically than their original counterparts. These may look and sound better on analog CRTs and 240 line resolution monitors....but if you have HD screens, you're bound to be very sorely disappointed. I have all the boots that this four DVD set has included, and I have made the comparisons. In some cases, the original boots look and sound BETTER than this legitimate release.
If you don't already have this material and you wish to view them on your older 4:3 screens, then...by all means...enjoy these rare performances. If you already have most of this material (Isle of Wight is already available commercially)..I do not recommend making this purchase. The sound and video are surprisingly sub-standard and not viable on any HD screen..you are bound to be upset and very frustrated.
My one star rating is based solely on the sub-standard mastering of this set...NOT the performances...TULL RULES!!",1372204800,73,1313,5.0
5716835,5,B00CDV4Q54,I ordered this well in advance of its release. I am not disappointed. This shows Tull at almost every point of their career. Early on they do songs that you will not recognize. Also included are songs from Ian Andersons solo career. This includes 4 CDs. There is a lot of music. If you are a Tull fan you can't go wrong,1372204800,4,319,4.161290322580645
5716856,1,B00CDV4Q54,"......go to YouTube and see JETHRO TULL at their finest in a myriad of video from the 1970's (BEAT CLUB, French TV, BBC Sight & Sound, Tanglewood, the ""Too Old"" Special, etc.) in better quality than a lot of this waste of a DVD set.  Face it, when Anderson screwed up his voice, his singing career was over, whether he, or his fans, want to admit or not.  I feel bad for him, but he has enough $$$ coming in to ease his pain. If he wanted to give his fans value for money he'd have included all the great '70's video missing from this set.  Save your hard-earned money......",1384732800,6,574,4.2
5716857,5,B00CDV4Q54,"I am really happy to have this. Like several other reviewers, I have owned the ""unofficial"" versions of many of these shows, and I am very pleased to be able to actually pay the artists for their work and to buy officially licensed product.

Contrary to other reviewers though I will say that the video and audio (if still not great, or even very good in the case of the 1980 Munich show) is much improved. Munich 1980 is now actually watchable and enjoyable. I guess some of the other reviewers would have been happier had they not put Munich on this set at all. I am a big fan of the Stormwatch era and am very happy to have it warts and all.

Of course the newer shows--1990s and 2000s--look and sound just fine.",1383955200,5,715,4.288888888888889
5716858,5,B00CDV4Q54,Fascinating from beginning to end and also corrected long held myths. Every Jethro Tull  fan needs to add this to their library of music memorabilia. Great gift for friends!,1382572800,2,173,4.9655172413793105
5716859,5,B00CDV4Q54,I love Juthro Tull but never bought a concert DVD of theirs because there was always something lacking until this one came out. This pretty much covers the span of their career and has a good deal of the favorites. I'm very happy with this collection and the fast service I received.,1380672000,2,283,4.461538461538462
5716860,5,B00CDV4Q54,I was so glad when this arrived and to see how much stuff was not on other DVDs. Im from Tampa and they had a show on disc 1 from here.,1378166400,,135,3.3870967741935485
5716861,4,B00CDV4Q54,"Most of the footage I've never seen before which is a real treat, but video and audio quality is lacking on some of the shows as if they came from bootlegs. None the less, anything I can see of the band is always good viewing. True fans won't be disappointed.",1376784000,5,259,4.2
5716862,4,B00CDV4Q54,"Would have liked to have seen more from the ""Warchild"", ""Minstrel in The Gallery"", ""Songs from the Wood"" ""Heavy Horses"" era.",1376006400,2,124,4.9523809523809526
5716863,5,B00CDV4Q54,"This is a great compilation of Jethro Tull live throughout the career span.
Several various lineups are featured and as always, Ian Anderson aims to please his paying audience!",1375574400,,176,5.103448275862069
5716864,5,B00CDV4Q54,If you are a fan of Jethro Tull you are sure to enjoy this 6 and a half hour tour of the history of one of the great and most under-rated bands in all of music. If your new to the music this is a great place to start.,1374883200,2,217,3.4489795918367347
5716865,5,B00CDV4Q54,I delighted at the old Jethro Tull footage and the newer footage.  It was simply amazing and outstanding as a video.,1374796800,,116,4.523809523809524
8580605,4,B00CDV4Q54,As far as the set goes. . . .it's fantastic. As many others have stated some greater mastering could've been done to the video but the sound is overall pretty good. It covers a huge span of time for Tull and most fans should have this. The Lugano and Tampa shows alone are worth it!!!,1467590400,,284,4.181818181818182
8580606,5,B00CDV4Q54,Jethro Tull is the best!!!!!!!,1421452800,,30,5.2

8580608,4,B00CDV4Q54,"Really enjoy this live dvd collection. I have been a Tull fan since aqualung was released,wish there were some '70's concerts included when they toured to support the albums Passion play and Thick as a brick , i've never seen any  live video from those tours !!!",1408579200,2,262,4.574468085106383
8580609,5,B00CDV4Q54,"Always enjoyed Tull's music and quirky muscian antics. This is the best, watching and hearing Tull play at various venues. This is a must have 3 DVD set that it never disappointed me.",1395705600,2,183,4.575757575757576
8580610,4,B00CDV4Q54,"I very much enjoyed the first 2 dvd's. The material from 1970 was new to me, and it was wonderful to see Ian bounce around the stage with so much energy. The dvd that covered the South America tour sadly showed how bad Ian's voice had slipped in the 1980's.  Oddly enough, he seems to have discovered how to work within his vocal limitations. This is a compilation any true fan should enjoy, although I suspect a newcomer to the band's music would be better served by just listening to the stock cd's that are available everywhere.",1393804800,3,531,4.474226804123711
8580611,1,B00CDV4Q54,"As others have stated, Tull's peak (album sales/concert sell-outs) was during the Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond-Hammond years - by far the best stage performances by the best band I've ever seen. I've watched at least a dozen officially released DVDs of Tull but NOT ONE OF THEM HAS JEFFREY ON BASS! I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but why have we never seen Jeffrey on an officially released live DVD or album? Releasing the Paris 1975 concert would definately quiet me down. You can keep your 80s to present Tull material, release something between 1971-75. More than 1000 sold out concerts during that period, any one of those will do! Thanks for listening.",1393200000,13,653,4.945454545454545
8580612,5,B00CDV4Q54,"There has been much discussion about recycled material in this package. This is true for Europe but not the US. Most of this I have not seen and I've been chasing Tull material for years.
It is not for the casual Tull fan though. While you may be able to find snatches on the internet, for me (a rabid fan) I want it on my large screen HD and blasting through the receiver with enough force to terrify the neighbors. I'm not getting that over a laptop.",1388534400,2,452,4.206896551724138
8580613,4,B00CDV4Q54,"Many of us have seen this stuff already. Ho Hum. But for those of you who haven't, definitely pick this collection up. I will give this item 4 stars because I want those people to see these shows.
THAT BEING SAID... I must insist that Ian release the July 5th, 1975 show shot in Paris, France.  I know you and Chrysalis Records professionally shot over 70 minutes of that show. You talked about it in several interviews at the time. Multi-camera shoot with professional sound (some of which appeared in the 25th Anniversary CD set).
SO PLEASE IAN... release that great 1975 (Minstrel In The Gallery tour) show. Even if it doesn't have all the sound.
THANK YOU SIR.",1388448000,13,664,4.579831932773109
8580614,2,B00CDV4Q54,"When I heard about the release of this set I was thrilled. Could it be that at long last we lifelong fans were going to be able to relive the great memories we have of the band's great shows in the early to mid seventies? Alas, no. There is NOTHING here from the lineup that gave us Thick As A Brick or Passion Play, arguably Tull's greatest works both in studio and live. Indeed, the original TAAB tour and Passion Play tour were magical, incredible shows. I cannot believe there is not one professionally shot video or even a decent audio recording of any of it. The band was at it's peak between 1971 and 1975 with the lineup of Ian and Martin and John Evans, Barrie Barlow and the one-and-only Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond. I will continue to hope and pray Mr. Anderson will find in his attics somewhere the films and tapes of these years and will release them to an adoring public that has never forgotten the Jethro Tull of those great and wonderful times.",1388275200,9,957,4.443181818181818
