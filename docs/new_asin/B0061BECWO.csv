8490774,4,B0061BECWO,"This is an excellent series with great scripts and great acting.

Nina at first appears to be a takeoff from Ally MacBeal, with her fantasies.  However, whereas Ally's fantasies seemed to simply be inserted because the writer thought of them (a massive tongue slurping on some guy she sees), Nina's fantasies are related directly to her life and it appears that they are real and not simply written in.  We experience her fantasies and often her inner thoughts, which works seamlessly with the actions.

Nina, Billie and Jimmie Proudman are 2 sisters and a brother, all with their own personal defects, which border on neurosis.  However, the characters all seem quite real, easy to empathize with; and none of them appear to be too much of a caricature.  If you met them in person, you would think they are real people, although you might avoid them.  None of them appear to be weird for weird's sake.  Furthermore, these are complex and interesting characters.

Now, several warnings:
If you buy the PAL version or a non-USA version, make sure you have a region-free DVD player (mine plays, so far, every disc I have purchased, even the PAL formal).
There is swearing and profanity.  On the one hand, I am not happy with this; on the other hand, they do not overdo it as I have found on most HBO or Showtime series, where it seems as though some characters use f-word combinations as a part of their every thought.  Swearing is to be found in this series, but it does not appear to be overdone.
There is no normal morality here.  The characters will have sex, they will have babies, and then they might discuss the idea of marriage.
There are at least 3 gay characters in the first two years, but the lesbian marriage plays a relatively small part in the 2nd season, and the gay character is not flaunting his gayness in every scene.  On the other hand, when dealing with these relationships, the gay characters are treated almost exactly the same as heterosexual characters, despite the fact that, it is not that way in real life.
There is nudity in this 2nd season, but not of any of the main characters.  My guess is, the main characters have all contracted out of full-on nudity.
This 2nd season starts off poorly with a great deal of sex.  However, once we get the the 3rd or 4th episode, the series focuses on the main characters again and the series becomes character driven rather than plot driven.",1470528000,,2408,4.619718309859155
