899359,2,6304584954,"This movie seem different than the rest of the series. Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Moses all setup the characters nicely and stick to the Bible when writing. The writers for David seem to come from another team. I was  disappointed with the production of this movie. I would not recommend this  movie for collection because the story is not well defined, they missed too  many details and added too many factors that are not in the Bible.",948067200,22,437,4.64935064935065

They not only helped me understand the Old Testament, they put a human faces to people that I only thought of as characters, not people.  What I love the most, is that these movies are good!  The quality of the  actors, production, and presentation are top shelf.  Actually I wonder how  they ever got made. The set includes Abraham, Joseph, Moses and David. I  can't pick a favorite, but I can suggest that you get Jacob in addition to  this set to round out your collection.",937440000,21,555,4.320388349514563

899468,3,6304584954,"A good attempt to tell the David story honestly, but needed to longer and tell about all the dirty laundry. With David there is plenty of dirty laundry and this complex character is important to understanding history and to understanding the Bible. Well acted, but the story leaves out too much you need to know. You would be better served by reading Baruch Halpern's book on David that tells the whole story and tells it well. David was a real historical personage and the account him in the Bible is likely a propaganda piece put out by David or more likely his son Solomon as a legal brief to try to spin his sordid career and justify the unjustifiable. No ruler would ever put out material  this damning about themselves unless it was for an audience that knew most of the facts and with whom a legal brief like this might help make David sound palatable and capable, if not always a good guy.",1492992000,,897,4.469512195121951

Its kind of like ""See David in the field with the sheep,see David tells Saul he will kill Goliath and sets out to do so and bring the head of Goliath to King Saul,See David go out and kill more Philistines and bring 200 foreskins of Philistines before King Saul,See David get married,see David then run off on horseback in the middle of the night,now see David talk to Jonathan in the middle of the day....""

I would like to see more movies/shows like this made, great quality - but BEWARE - for those well versed or thsoe unlearned, there are biblical inconsistencies on things that are irrefutable. Although it states that it ""tries to be consistent with the spirit of the Bible"", it is NOT ""true to the bible"" small things (simple statements) AND LARGE THINGS (like the whole story of Samson and deletion of Davids other wives) WERE VERY DISAPPOINTING.

899668,5,6304584954,"I wanted David because the psalms is my favorite part of the Bible and David wrote the Psalms. Many twist and turns. So Listen Up. Saul was first chosen by God. Saul sinned in the eyes of God. So David became the next chosen by God of coarse the drove Saul insanely jealous of David. David married Saul daughter and Saul tried to have David Killed. David left to save his life. David asked a man who owed him favors in another village for help the men refused, that mans wife decided to help David with food and blankets of coarse David fell in love with that woman and he married her. So now he has 2 wives. Later he met another woman named Bathsheba she was the wife of one of Davids most loyal soldiers. Of coarse David fell in love with Bathsheba, he got her pregnant. Then he set Bathsheba husband up too be killed while in battle. Bathsheba and David married so now he has 3 wives. David impregnating Bathsheba and setting up her husband for death was of coarse a sin, so God took David and Bathsheba first born. They did have another son later named Solomon. David had several children with all 3 wives. After growing up 1 of David sons raped his own sister they had different mothers all fathered by David. David forgave his son for the rape and let him live. The other brother didn't like that so he had the son the committed the rape killed. that son left for awhile and then returned after being captured, that same son had evil influences in his ear and those influences convinced him to rise against his father David. David once again fled for his life. The two armies David and his sons went to war and David army won the battle David son that rose against him was killed in that battle. David was devastated over the death of his son. The movie wasn't bloody and nude like some of the views said. Bathsheba butt was shown from a distance for 1 second. and the killings wasn't bloody and gruesome.......I also ordered Joseph & Abraham....I watched Joseph I didn't like it. Only because It was very sad & it made me cry uncontrollably at the end. David story was the best to me. I watched Abraham it was good.,,,I rate......#1 David........#2 Abraham..........#3 Joseph.......only because Joseph was so sad out of the Three......",1454889600,,2242,4.470731707317073

899746,4,6304584954,"From the 'Bible Collection' Series, this 182-minute, single, color, DVD-disc presentation of Israel's' beloved, second King - DAVID, is a dramatic, epic, movie hit! This film is not just for Christians or Sunday School Teachers, who collect Bible films for the kiddies. No. Rather, it is for any movie watcher, who enjoys a great flick which encompasses Holy Scripture, history, love, forbidden passion, war, an internal and international scandal, a curse rendered, a house divided, loss, vengeance, blatant rebellion, power plays, forgiveness and restoration. If that type of movie sounds interesting to you, then look no further. Or, if you're looking for a unique and intense, true-life, soap opera within the biblical halls of royalty, then here you are. Soup-to-nuts, it's all here. Human passion in every form, as expressed by a man who became a King, who was also a very spiritual man, so much so, that he was a man after God's own heart (I Samuel 13:14 KJV). DAVID - a man who was given everything but almost lost it all, for Bathsheba... a married woman, whom he truly, loved. But, was it worth it? The words: Love & Lust - both start with the letter 'L', but one - lust, is purely carnal and very fleeting with nothing more than the satisfaction of ones immediate selfish desires. And, the other - love, well, it is from the heart, it's lasting, committed and monogamous (See I Corinthians 13). And, for all the wives and concubines that DAVID had at his disposal, when he first saw Bathsheba, he just had to have her. Why? Well, because he actually, as in truly, fell in love. Love at first sight? It happens, whether you believe in it or not. But, in DAVID's case, there was one major  problem: Bathsheba was married to Uriah, a Captain in DAVID's army, who was very loyal to his King. Solution: DAVID ordered the murder of Uriah, so that he could 'cover up' Bathsheba's pregnancy which he fathered. But, the ever vigilant Lord, saw what DAVID did, and speaking through His Prophet Nathan, He rebuked, punished and even went so far as too curse DAVID and consequently, his entire household, saying: ""... I (the Lord) anointed thee King over Israel, and delivered thee out of the hand of Saul (who was trying to kill him); And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the House of Israel and of Judah; (DAVID inherited everything from his predecessor King Saul, instead of Saul's own sons whom the Lord had destroyed, in favor of DAVID). And if that had been to little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in His sight? Thou has killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the Children of Ammon (DAVID deliberately set Uriah up so that he would be killed by the Ammonites, with whom Israel was at war, with...); Now therefore, the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised Me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife; ... Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thee own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give them unto thy neighbor, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of the sun. For thou didst it secretly: But I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun"" (II Samuel 12:7-12 KJV). Betrayal and adultery, do have it's lasting consequences. Particularly, when you deliberately break the Lords' commandments. All in all, this biographical big-screen depiction of the life of a shepherd who became a King - King DAVID, is excellent. It is a factual, movie illustration that is historically sound and scripturally accurate. Also, it's a non-obtrusive, easy, way to learn and educate others about biblical do's and don'ts and the consequences or marital and spiritual adultery, as seen through the life of DAVID. It's spoken language is English in Dolby Stereo Surround Sound, with the additive of English, Spanish and French subtitles. This 2002, big-screen, color, epic, DVD presentation is sure to entertain and perhaps even shock, it's audience. How? In it's candid portrayal of an intense man, who was desperately torn between his genuine love for the Lord and his love and lust of the flesh, and it's many desires. As opposed too, his obedience and sacrifice to all things, holy. However, his dichotomous drives are not unique. Every human being struggles with hard choices, at some point in their life. We are have are strengths and our weaknesses, right?! So, DAVID's seemingly dual disposition is actually, quite normal. Because, in all honesty, in some form or fashion, we've all been there. Whether we acted on it or not. Everyday people are challenged and tempted by passionate indulgences of every kind yet, those very same people may believe in God with their whole heart. Is this internal struggle, normal and natural even in the life of a King who was hand-picked by the Lord Himself? Absolutely. Why should royalty, clergy members, Christians or those who in any capacity, uphold the secular laws such as Law Enforcement Personnel, be exempt? They, like DAVID and the rest of us, are human beings. And again, we all..., have to deal with the constant battle of abstinence, moderation or indulgence throughout each of our lives, in a variety of capacities. And DAVID, was no exemption. For even Christ Himself, said: ""...the spirit (within man) indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak"" (Matthew 26:41 KJV). That's why the Lord forgave DAVID, but did not remove his curse or the consequences of his actions. The Lord in His mercy and undying love for DAVID, modified the severity of his punishment by not toppling his throne, destroying him and his beloved Bathsheba and by allowing their second son - Solomon, to be the third King of Israel. It's all right, here! So, pop the popcorn, settle-in and watch this epic blockbuster, wherever you can relax and enjoy an excellent movie. A keeper for your epic DVD collection.

899856,3,6304584954,"Part one is quite faithful to the Biblical narrative, and I loved Nimoy's friendly, down-to-earth Samuel. Despite strong performances, some scenes are over-simplified, such as the ones with Nabal and Goliath. Part two adds scenes that made no sense to me. For example, in my view, David and Bathsheba was not a great romance, but an episode of abuse of power with a member of the kingdom that probably couldn't really say no. But in the film we have schmaltzy dialogue between them and she is by his side as a ""soulmate"" in every major scene, whereas in the Bible account AFAIK Solomon's birth is the last mention of her. David is also way more poet than warrior. Neat interweaving of the Psalms with the relevant scenes as indicated in the superscriptions.",1433030400,,757,4.742424242424242

900047,5,6304584954,"David's story is still my favorite Old Testament stories of all time. I remember my Sunday School teacher teaching us this song about a boy named David when I was still in Middle School. Here's how it goes.

Only a boy named David, only a little sling
Only a boy named David, but he could pray and sing
Only a boy named David, only a rippling brook
Only a boy named David, but 5 little stones he took

And one little stone went in the sling
and the sling went round and round
And one little stone went in the sling
and the sling went round and round
And round, and round, and round and round,
And round and round and round

And one little stone went up in the air...
O-whooo--- O-whooo O-whooo
And the giant came tumbling down!

Some liberties or non-cannonical inclusions have been made by some secondary and sometimes fictional characters to adequately tell the story and give it psychological perspective, but the doctinal messages remain unchanged. Particular care is given to the central prophet character in each episode, though human, to not diminish the spiritual impact and his righteous contibution to the Holy Writ. Female leads are also very strong and integral counterpoints to the story lines. Behind every great man is an even greater woman. They both share in God's prupose and mission for His Chosen People.
Except for the story of Jacob which is about 90 minutes long, the others are told in two-parts making them approximatey 3 hours in length. Well produced in African locales. Good photography and musical scores. Spiritual effects are handled nicely as well, if not low-key in a natural sort of way.",1404432000,3,956,5.248366013071895

The scenes and dialog were short and choppy. Leonard Nimoy who played Samuel was not as convincing or enthused about his role it seemed. Hes excellent on Star Trek as Spock but here his character was lacking punch and his dialog was too articulate. Being a Bible movie, I like to hear the King James dialog to be more authentic.

900340,5,6304584954,"This movie is the best you will find on King David, the best-cast film of the TNT Bible Series, and one of the finest entries in that very fine collection of Biblical films. Like all the films in that series, it uses top-notch actors and favors a style of realism over supernatural manifestations, giving us fully developed human characters rather than special effects. But this film is more focused and less boring than some other titles in the series. It is remarkably fast-moving for a 3-hour TNT miniseries, being well-edited with short punchy action sequences and well-staged dramatic confrontations. Sticking close to 1 and 2 Samuel from the Bible, it also includes a generous helping of the psalms attributed to David, and is the most biblically accurate film on this subject available.

But here's the bottom line: The film is just plain entertaining and exciting, managing to be such while sticking remarkably close to the Biblical source text. It has a fantastic musical score, great sets and costumes, serviceable battle scenes, and perfectly cast actors. Teens and adults will not find their attention wavering for most of the running time here. As a TV film, the emphasis is decidedly on character drama over spectacle, but the battles are good too. For a film without large-scale battles, the script moves swiftly, with the acting and music delivering genuine thrills -- as in the Goliath battle and ensuing sequence with young David carrying the severed head in a triumphant daze -- even though one wishes for greater numbers of soldiers to avoid the appearance of mere skirmishes this film evokes. Nathaniel Parker (picking up from Gideon Turner as the younger David) makes a great King David, exhuding strong self-assurance as a leader, but also displaying human weakness and many other emotional nuances in his character arc. He's clearly doing the Bible as Shakespeare here and it works very well. Also in the Shakespearean vein, the always-excellent Jonathon Pryce plays King Saul in full Lear mode, giving us a tragic and pathetic figure whose demise comes about through his disobedience of God. Leonard Nimoy, the Jewish actor who originated Mr. Spock on ""Star Trek,"" surprises the most with a deeply felt and finely wrought performance as the prophet Samuel -- he nails the essence of a fiery and passionate Old Testament prophet with only a few major scenes early in the film, particularly in the anointings and in his final confrontation with Saul and King Agag. His performance is brilliant. Franco Nero does the same with the prophet Nathan, but is more of a background character here. Sheryl Lee makes a memorable Bathsheba and even the minor players -- particularly those playing David's children -- leave a favorable impression.

The film's first half describes the rise and fall of King Saul, the rise of David to war hero and prince apparent, and the demise of Saul. Second half focuses on David's sin with Bathsheba, the family problems David had due to his adultery, and the rebellion led against him by his son. The film loses some of its energy and intensity in the last 50 minutes, giving us a bit too much dialogue that feels expository rather than building to a genuinely thrilling showdown between David and Absalom, as the showdown with Saul from the film's first half had been truly involving. But it regroups nicely with a joyful epilogue prefiguring the Temple. In the TNT Bible Series, this is my second favorite OT film behind the Emmy-winning ""Joseph,"" being a notch down because of the protracted climax just mentioned. The film ""Moses"" with Ben Kingsley (my third favorite) is also excellent, but is a bit slow-moving compared to this one, making it a harder sell even for teenaged audiences. If you want an Old Testament/Torah film that is Biblically accurate (mostly) and edifying without totally sacrificing entertainment, then this is the film for you. I showed it to 16-year old religion students and they loved it as a catechetical tool that really helped them understand the scattered OT books that relate to David's life.",1383004800,23,4078,4.978005865102639

900484,5,6304584954,"Magnificent production taking us from the selection of King Saul (played with pathos and panache by Jonathan Pryce) through to King David's section of his son Solomon as his heir.
All the events described in the Bible are brought to life quite engagingly, with intelligent and dramatic dialogue and almost perfect casting.
Leonard Nimoy captures the courage and confidence of the young David, and Nathaniel Parker plays the title role of King David just as he was meant to be.
Sterling roles by Franco Nero as the prophet Nathan, and Sheryl Lee as an alluring and engaging Batsheba, who will be a source of courage and strength for David, and will be instrumental in the epic finale opening the way for the reign of Solomon (Luke Elliot) who is a young child at the end of the film . The scene where Saul consults the witch of Eindor to summon the spirit of Samuel is eerily brilliant and the witch played prefectly.
The scene where Nathan confronts David is particularly stirring.
The rape of Tamar played by the lovely Clara Beller gives us a new sympathy for the girl and her destruction by the wicked Amnon (Edward Hall) while a brilliantly arrogant and calculating Absalom is played by Dominic Rowan. This movie progresses with great flow and there is never a dull moment
The only complaints being that the battle scenes are understated and not large and impressive enough and the setting in the Sahara in Morocco is a very different environment to the land of Israel where the location of filming should have been",1354233600,2,1519,4.735849056603773

Samson and Delilah, I found it entertaining, but I believe not to faithfull to the bible story, from what I understand from my biblical study.  To be honest, I'm new in the bible study.  Moses is good, for the basic part is what the bible teaches, but I found strange that the movie omits an important part of Moses' journey, when he traveled to Egypt with his wife,  and son, and that God was going to kill his first son, and his wife has to circuncide the child to save him  (Exodus 4 :24). The movie tells the story on how Moses met his wife, but doesn't show the two sons, neither shows that he leaves to Egipt with his wife, instead in the movie he departs alone, leaving her behind with her father and her two sisters.  That threw me off with the movie of Moses, I think that was an important part of the story to be omit.  According to the bible, Moses father in law, Jethrow,  had seven daughters including Zipporah, Moses wife.  The movie only shows two sisters and Zipporah.  I found some discrepancies with this movie.  Maybe some other movies have discrepancies, but I just noticed in Moses.

900516,3,6304584954,"My experience with Biblical films has been varied. Many of them have good intentions and a poor delivery, but this presentation is on par with the best of them. David is a surprisingly moving and engaging retelling of one of the Old Testament's most memorable figures.

When a mysterious storm arises and the donkeys belonging to Saul (Jonathan Pryce) vanish before his sons' very eyes, he and his son Jonathan (Ben Daniels) set out to learn what has become of their property. Their search takes them into a neighboring community and places them in the path of Samuel (Leonard Nimoy), a prophet who has been instructed by God to anoint a leader for the Israelites. He informs Saul that he has been chosen to command their armies and preside as king, a position that Saul feels unworthy of but accepts. God establishes him as a man of influence and power but when Samuel departs to heed the voice of God and leaves Saul to ponder what might be done against the invading Philistine army, Saul begins to doubt that God is with him. His attempt to communicate with God rather than waiting for Samuel's return deeply grieves God, who promises that he will be replaced -- and sends Samuel out once more to choose an eventual successor. This time, Samuel finds him in a shepherd boy named David, whose earnest desire to please God is so profound that he will do anything in His name.

David is known far and wide for his remarkable playing and singing and so when Saul is plagued by ""demons"" that will not allow him to sleep, Jonathan asks David if he will not come and soothe his father's rest. David becomes an invaluable member of the king's household and eventually takes a stand against their brutal enemy, Goliath, that wins the approval of the people and generates a profound jealousy in Saul. David (Nathanial Parker) must then flee for his life ... but much lies ahead for this future king of Israel, an individual who became known in scripture as a ""man after God's own heart.""

Most films in this genre suffer from stilted casting and poor directing but this television film is excellent. It has a great cast, most of which are recognizable from other period pieces and films. Parker is a wonderful David -- he takes a character that could be flat and uninteresting beyond his achievements and transforms him into a living, breathing person that the audience falls in love with not merely as a hero in the classic sense, but as a man of immense faith and respect for God. I admit that I have always thought of David in somewhat skeptical terms since scripture does not allow us to ""know him"" beyond his accomplishments (and several enormous mistakes) but once finishing this movie, it made me want to go back and read his portion of scripture. Parker is just the right blend of youth and innocence and an almost overwhelming sense of compassion. The most profound moments are his scenes of remorse and grief in the aftermath of his adulterous tryst and with what happens between his sons. The supporting cast is also quite good. Nimoy is a subdued but memorable Samuel, and Franco Nero is a superb Nathan. While the leading ladies do not have an enormous role, they are worth mentioning. It also has an absolutely beautiful musical score.

While the story does stick primarily to the scriptural account, there are some minor changes made. Saul is much older than he would have been when we first meet him and does not fit the physical description; David is anointed alone (in scripture, his brothers witness the ceremony); the battle with Goliath happens with only two onlookers (as opposed to two individual armies); Nabal's death happens sooner in the film than it did in real life; Uriaha meets a different fate. It is a little confusing later on as to which of his sons are from what wives, and who their companions actually are. My only true complaint is that Goliath is a little bit of a letdown -- he's a large man but not nearly as impressive as I anticipated.

I admire the film for being restrained in dealing with the darker aspects of the story, and also for its uplifting conclusion. It does not end at the death of David but many years before, with his assurance that in spite of his shortcomings, his household is to be blessed forever. Out of the many films based on scripture, this will probably become my favorite for its rich characters. If you can tolerate its occasional brutality, you will find it as engaging as I did.",1332374400,2,4445,4.635786802030457

900596,5,6304584954,"This movie, (originally broadcast on TNT), is a stirring depiction of the life of King David, ""the man after God's own heart."" The accurate production rarely deviates from Scripture.  The miniseries is a wonderful visual representation of the life of one of the most complex men in all of human history.

Spanning the time from Saul's anointing to David's death, the film covers a great quantity of ground in a very effective way.  The director does a superb job of emphasizing David's triumphs and struggles.  Interspersed into the action are stirring excerpts from some of David's psalms, which provide a glimpse into David's heart.  I particularly appreciate the fact that David's shortcomings, (most notably his sin with Bathsheba), is not glorified nor sugarcoated.  God's Word does not condone sin, yet it does not gloss over it either.  Therefore, David is a man who struggles with God as we all do.

The three aspects of the film I particularly enjoyed were:

1. The portrayal of the rivalry between Saul and David.  Jonathan Price is magnificent as the complex Saul: a man risen from humble beginnings to become Israel's king: a man driven mad by his lust for power and prestige.
2. The episode with Bathsheba and Uriah.  Nathaniel Parker is exceptional in this scene.  He portrays a man driven by desperation to conceal an evil act.  However, even while plotting Uriah's downfall, he is still sympathetic.  There is even a brief instance where the viewer thinks he will turn from his devious actions.
3. Absalom's rebellion.  This heartwrenching depiction illustrates how human nature never changes, and how children still seek their parents love even when they have done wrong.  This portrayal also illustrates how children become angry with parents so easily.  Absalom is portrayed as a multi-layered character, one whom the viewer can empathize with.  The consequences of David's wrongdoing affected his entire family, and the scene with Amnon and Tamar is horrifying and unforgettable.  The viewer sympathizes with Absalom even if he/she does not condone his actions toward David.

Besides the two actors previously mentioned, Lennard Nemoy is outstanding as the prophet Samuel.  These three men turn in stellar performances.

My final comment is that I love the scenes where God speaks.  The actor doing this voice over is perfect: God is portrayed as having a gentle yet firm voice, reminiscent of a kindly father, and the voice throbs with anger, compassion, and love.  ""David"" reminds us all that we must confess and repent of our sins, and illustrates God's supreme and magnificent grace.  Please give this excellent movie a chance.

900660,5,6304584954,"I recommend this movie for a visual review of the Biblical story. It will probably send you back to the scriptures to read it again.

The movie started out a little slowly for me, but then picked up. About 1/4 of the way through, I was enjoying it very much. It was worth staying with it.

I enjoyed Leonard Nimoy in the part of the Prophet, Samuel, a choice I never would have considered. He made that character come to life.

All-in-all, this movie had everything I was looking for and told the story well.

There were a few problems for me with the way they matched up David's wives and children. He had more wives than were shown and I don't think they got that part right. In fact, Michal was childless according to the scriptures.

When Saul's daughter, Michal, David's first wife, saved David's life, the movie shows that she put one of her maids in the bed so that the guards killed her, thinking she was David, meaning that the maid was killed instead of him. That isn't the way the scriptures tell it. Michal put an idol in the bed and something with goat's hair to look like David was sleeping there.

When Saul had the priests killed because they had given David food and Goliath's sword, the movie showed about 5-6 priests being killed. The scriptures say there were 85 priests killed that day, and then they went on to the city of the priests and continued by killing the priests' families and all their livestock. Only one person escaped.

When Abigail returned home from taking supplies to David and asking his forgiveness for the disgraceful way her husband Nabal had treated him, she didn't tell Nabal what she had done because he was having a big party and was drunk. She told him the next day and he didn't just drop dead. He had a stroke and died 10 days later.

The actors did a great job and the scenery and clothing worked well. I did think it was strange that one of David's sons seemed to have an australian accent, another interesting choice.

I recommend the Solomon DVD to follow this one.",1270944000,,2018,4.4471544715447155

He came back a week later and was so excited over the set we purchased that he inicated a friday family night at our Church to watch each one of the films and he has gone on Amazon to complete his set.  The films have top actors playing the roles of the patriarchs of the old testiment and new testiment the screen plays are dynamic and well thought out always considering the WORD OF GOD first and formost to stay as close to the actual story as possible.  The costumes and sets are amazing everything takes you to that time in the bible
They are well worth their price in Gold just wish they would do more of them because there are a lot of storys that are missing but am glad for the ones they did produce with such reverence for the WORD of GOD.

It's done fairly well, Biblically accurate for the most part, and conveys the same message as the Scriptures tend to in the Biblical areas it traverses.  Our family enjoyed this one, on many levels.  We'd say ""buy this one!"" as it's pretty good....but....

The one exception to us recommending this film, is going to only strike a positive/helpful note with few people (we realize), but nevertheless....the problem we have with this film is that real live human beings with real life families (husbands, and/or wives, and/or children) are being intimate with other people outside of their family all for the sake of ""it's just a job, it's acting.""  We personally don't believe that God will every approve body-close-holding and smooching, as ""just a job so it's okay"" when it comes to non-married people.  You simply won't find that kind of behavior ever supported or condoned in the Bible.  As i said, we realize this won't be a popular stance, in a Media-soaked culture, but nonetheless...it's the flat truth.  So we cannot recommend you actually buy this film.  There ARE films on the market, few though, that have actual actors who are husbands and wives being intimate on screen...or that have husbands and wives pictured who aren't married outside the movie but BARELELY touch in any intimate way (like FireProof, Facing the Giants, Time Changer, Flywheel, and others).  We recommend you just place your own family member in the actor's spot, and see how you'd feel watching your partner or child doing the intimacy with a complete stranger (IN FRONT OF THEIR CHILDREN OR SPOUSE).

900683,5,6304584954,"First off, I am well pleased with these movies. I was pleasantly suprised with the quality of the acting, sets, and costumes of the films. I'm a big movie buff and also an avid reader of the Bible and a believer and While these movies might not be 100.00% biblically accurate they come much closer than what you could really ever hope to find. I found myself inspired by the films and still pleasantly entertained. Lets face it folks Cecil B Demille's The Ten commandments and Jesus of Nazareth are NOT perfect in their delivery of scriptural truth. But many people fail to realize these are MOVIES..they are designed for entertainment. The Holy Bible isn't for entertainment it is for learning! See what I'm getting at here? Liberties are taken with the stories in some areas with the Bible Collection films but for the most part the major and/or important events seem to have been handled with great care and the liberties that are taken did not seem to detract from or deface the biblical characters or events in any way. So I'll break down my reviews into little bits for each type of person who may be looking to buy this set.

~IF you are trying to be lazy and find a movie so you do not have to read a Bible to find out the facts about the real stories...Just stop. There is NO substitute for good old fashioned Bible study. Buy the movies but please at least try and read it for yourself. Most of these movies are 3 hours long and most are pulled from the book of genesis and could be read in far less time than that!

~IF you are a Movie Fan who also enjoys the stories of the Bible...I think you'll find the purchase of this set or any of the Bible collection movies worth your time and money.

~If your trying to expand your Bible studies and are branching out into the visual and human qualities of the characters of the Bible these movies have alot of good ideas about what things may have been like during these times and for these characters personally. Helps to kinda fill in the gaps between the Who , what , when and where's of the scriptures. I recommend this as an ADDITION to a Bible study. Perhaps follow along with a Bible in hand and still have a bit of fun while learning.

~If your just a movie Fan period. I think these movies stand alone as good quality entertainment. Minus a few million dollars in the budget making them but, still deliver a good bang for the buck.

So in short: The Bible Collection movies are Good movies! perhaps even inspiring!...perhaps even very very close to scriptures!..but are certainly not a substitute for actually reading or hearing the Bible itself.",1230595200,2,2610,4.463312368972747

Old Testament history is hard to keep straight as so very much happens but this film will burn this time of Saul and David and his son Solomon in your mind and heart not to be forgotten.

The acting is wonderful and everything looks real life, like you are there with them.

There is of course a lot of killing. It may be too much for small children. Although David sins he still remains a man after God's own heart. God has mercy on him many times. He had to pay dearly for his sins. All that God foretold comes true.

I am an avid Bible study student and I will say that these dvds are the greatest visual study tool to learn from in regards to cuture of the time, expressiveness, and extent of bringing the Bible to life. I will assure you that reading the Bible is first and foremost, but you should know not every detail may come from the Bible as for ""word for word"" but much of the culture of the time is evident. I know many will argue over ""exactness"" of words and details out of Bible text. The overall stories were not meant to take the place of the Bible, just enhance the overall meaning through a more ""visual"" format of Bible culture and Biblical truth.
I would say that it has enlightened my studies of the Bible and gave me alot of insight. I would highly recommend these dvds to anyone who loves to read the Bible and is not stuck on ""paraphrasing"" every word but, a person who loves to have the knowledge of scriptural messages and stories in an entertaining visual way.

However, with my children now in their teenage years, they are really getting into the live drama, with period costumes and ancient traditions. Overall, the stoylines are right in line with the scriptures, although for time reasons they did condense a few things. The personalites are at the directors discretion, but given the culture at the time, I believe the direction was spot on. The acting is wonderful...how can you go wrong with Ben Kingsly?! As potifer, he was both compassionate and stern, and as Moses...well, I had to get used to him with hair, hahha. The make-up, age progression, everything was amazing. Nothing distracted from the storyline, other than a few ""bad acting' spots from supporting actors. Oh and there was a very provocative bath scene with Joseph and Potifers wife...fast forwarding is a good option there.

Each of the stories take take place with great understanding of the ancient culture and traditions.

900750,4,6304584954,"This movie is a faithful adaptation from the biblical account of David and it gives a positive portrait of him.

A. The acting

Nathaniel Parker does a commendable job of portraying David as a reverent yet flawed servant of God. There is an interesting contrast in the earlier David versus the latter David.  The earlier David was very focussed on God and was very assertive and focussed.  The latter David, while dependent upon God, was hesitant about his actions, prone to failures and needed constant encouragement.

Sheryl Lee was very believable (and beautiful) as Bathsheba -- as this movie portrays her, she is David's favorite wife and constant source of encouragement in his latter years.  She is constantly at David's side (during the 2nd half of the movie).

Jonathan Pryce played the role of Saul as a tragic man who was rejected by God and who could not escape his doom.  Saul's tragic end at the hand of the Philistines (along with his sons) was very heartbreaking to watch.

Leonard Nimoy does a great job of portraying the godly prophet Samuel.  Franco Nero is very believable as the loyal prophet Nathan.

The actor who played Joab (Maurice Roeves, who played Colonel Munroe in ""the Last of the Mohicans"" 1992 version) looks way too old to be David's nephew. Joab is the 2nd son of Zeruiah, the sister of David, hence David's nephew.  Joab is portrayed as David's uncle. Maurice Roeves did a great job in portraying Joab. Some of the best scenes in this film involves Joab, especially when Joab rebukes David for mourning over his dead son Jonathan rather than congratulating his loyal friends for their victory.  The biblical portrait of Joab is that of a powerthirsty and cruel man.  This film portrays him in a much more positive and sympathetic light.

B.  The account of David

This film is the most complete account of David captured on film.  This film is the only one on David that shows David's rescue of his wife Abigail from the Amalekites, Absalom's hatred toward David and his conspiracy toward David / the rise and fall of Absalom,  Amnon's rape of Tamar, and God's covenant promise to David regarding his kingdom and his future descendants who will build the temple.

One word of caution for family viewers:  there are some scenes in this movie that might be too intense for younger viewers:  a lot of people get stabbed in the battle scenes, several people commit suicide (Saul, Ahithophel), and the witch at Endor is pretty scary looking as she conjures up the spirit ""Samuel"".

C.  What could have been improved

a) The close relationship between Jonathan and David could have been better depicted.  In this film, David's friendship with Jonathan seems more detached.  In the Bible, David describes his friendship with Jonathan as surpassing that of the love of women.

b) The fight between David and Goliath could have been better portrayed.  Goliath was a towering giant -- the Goliath in this movie was just a tad taller than David (and bears somewhat of a resemblance to Sylvester Stallone).  Also, Goliath met David with his armor bearer -- this movie had Goliath meet David alone.  This movie shows Goliath throwing a rough stone at David, which David then uses to strike Goliath with his sling.  In the biblical account, David carefully chooses 5 smooth stones to bring with him to the battle.

The fight between David and Goliath was a bit cheesy in the acting. However, to its credit, this movie shows David telling Goliath that he came to Goliath not with spear and sword but in the name of the Lord of Hosts.  David tells Goliath he will strike him down so the whole world will know there is a God in Israel.  I enjoyed that part.

c) The scenes involving Absalom were excellent in the earlier scenes (esp. his anger over the rape of Tamar), but the latter scenes were not as effective.  Absalom did not seem like a real threat to David.

One interesting scene to note:

David's progress in hearing the voice of the Lord:  During his early days and during most of his reign, David relied upon prophets such as Samuel and Nathan to hear the message of the Lord for him.  By the end of the movie, David is able to hear the message of the Lord directly, without the need of a prophet.

Conclusion:

In spite of this,  I thought this movie was a very good adaptation of the biblical description of David.  It made me want to read the biblical account all over again.  It is a very worthy edition to the Bible series collection, and it is one of the better movies on King David on film.  It is much more accurate than the dreadful ""King David"" with Richard Gere.",1182211200,20,4603,4.653846153846154
900751,4,6304584954,"The story of King David is a natural for cinematic production and there have been many attempts. This is another of the good ones which is to be expected since TNT's Bible collection has set a high standard.

This account takes a long view, from the time when David was a shepherd boy all the way through the pinnacle of power. Like the scriptural story itself, David is portrayed as a good, but not perfect man. The warts are in there as well. David does some things that are not too admirable.

A big part of this production is David's friendship with Jonathan, the son of the prior king. In his relations with Saul, Jonathan and even his faithless wife, David keeps the faith.

It is a good but not perfect story that is well done.",1179100800,4,734,4.382352941176471

Unlike the great Ten Commandments with Charlston Heston, it is not dramatic showing Moses as a hero, but a simple man called by God to deliver the Israelites.

I really enjoyed Abraham and his character. Joseph made me cry at the end with his humility and forgiveness. Every movie made me read the stories in the Bible and has definitely helped motivate my interest in the Old Testament books.",1173225600,5,520,4.531914893617022

As many know..if you want to be sure you are viewing or reading something accurate always do your background research before taking anything at face value immediately.  David has always been since I could remember the most memorable and my favorite character by far in the bible.  This movie to me gives a great account of the shepherd boy's life at an early age until his youngest son Solomon was to inherit the kingdom of Israel after David.  It was truly an awesome film and I would recommend it to anyone who is watching to learn and grow.  After watching this movie, I would strongly recommend reading 1 and 2 Samuels and the book of Psalms to know more of King David and how he became one of the greatest kings of Israel to humble himself before GOD after recognizing his sin and repenting to becoming that man after GOD's own heart.  Be prepared to be touched by this depiction.",1171843200,2,937,4.482352941176471

900816,3,6304584954,"This made-for-TV movie recounts the stories contained in 1 and 2 Samuel of the Bible about Israel's warrior-king David, and is one of a series of movies about important figures of the Old Testament.  I've reviewed some of the other movies previously, and overall this is a terrific series, but this film is certainly one of the weakest.  My biggest complaint about this film is it's length.  At 3+ hours, this film is way too long, and there are large parts where the action is very slow.  Not that I'm against long films, but the time was not put to good use.  There is certainly a great deal of ground that must be covered in order to recount more or less all of 1 and 2 Samuel, but this film should either have been condensed or separated into two.  The image portrayed of David in this film is also not very sympathetic.  He certainly doesn't come across as a great warrior king.  He steals the wife of one of his loyal soldiers, and can't control his own family.  I understand that these are biblical events, but the story is presented in such a way to give the appearance that David rules simply because it is God's will no matter how sinfully or stupidly he behaves.  Nathaniel Parker (who plays the role of David) appeared stiff and not very kingly in my view.  Leonard Nimoy plays the prophet Samuel though, he certainly has an air of gravitas about him as the prophet.  There are some things I liked about this film.  First, the writers/producers stuck largely to the biblical story.  Second, as with all films in this series, they are largely devoid of denominational overtone, so that I think they will appeal to a wide range of Christians and Jews.  I thought that the David/Goliath scene was particularly well done.  Goliath was a large, powerful, but otherwise ordinary man, not some mythic giant who would be more at home in Nordic mythology fighting Thor.  A good, if flawed, film.  Part of a great series though (Jeremiah and Joseph are the two strongest in my view).",1171152000,66,1985,4.559322033898305

I had them on video but always wanted the DVD version because of the ease of navigating to favorite scenes or just to resume watching.

Being a Bible student I realize that there is material in these videos that is not in the Bible but I am fine with that. I don't use these videos to study the Bible and learn about God but to help me visualize the times and places. That way everything becomes more real to me.

Each and every movie, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Samson & Delilah or David -all was superb and brought me more closer to the Old Testament. I have never heard about Joseph (son of Jacob)before but after seeing the movie, I saw it again for a second time. Jacob also is very good and so was David. But Abraham was repetitive for me as HE is the most discussed person in our Bible and I have heard a lot about him. Same was with Moses. But I prefer the ""Ten Commandments"" more to this version of ""Moses"".

Ten Commandments does not show us the very important scene where Moses doubts God and gets angry with HIM because when he first hits his staff on the stone for water, God does not bring forth  water. So Moses hits the staff once again for the second time and water flows out. This one scene is an important one in the life of Moses. Because Moses doubted God, God said that he will never enter the promised land but see it from afar. This important scene is shown in the movie ""Moses"" which is included in this collection.

If you are in faith with God and read the bible, especially the Old Testament, this is one worth for your collection.

900863,3,6304584954,This adaptation had many ups and downs in my opinion. Scenes with Samuel and Saul were well done but the whole Bathsheba and David scenarios didn't seem right. Sheryl Lee was miscast and looked in no way from the middle east at all. David from that point turned bland and uninteresting as there was not enough praise of God and his relationship with him. From all the psalms that he wrote you would think he'd have more of a spirit for God but this was not shown as such. Overall its an okay introduction but make sure you read your bible first and know what's accuarte and what's not.,1152144000,4,585,4.376146788990826
900864,4,6304584954,"Excellent story and they followed most of it fairly accurately.  Good job with the repercussions of David's adultery and how it affected his entire household for a long time thereafter.  The dynamics of the sons were well-done with only minor omissions in the plot here and there but not enough to damage the story badly... except in the case of Goliath.  With all the information about the account you'd think they could get one detail right but I'm not sure any aspect of it was accurate.  First of all, they show Goliath no larger than anyone else.  Also, there is no real context of a war and battle here... Goliath is just ambushing Saul's soldier's a couple at a time.  There is no forty days of taunts, David is already here, and Saul is about to bravely charge off to face Goliath (never showing the least fear of Goliath) when David says to let him.  He doesn't even try on Saul's armor (though Saul mentions it while ridiculing David about the impossibility of David fighting).

The only other major issue I recall was the presence of some excessive spirituality.  For example, when Saul is overcome by the Spirit he never prophecies, he just dances rather provocatively (a similar presentation when David dances but it is at least slightly more accurate in David's case).  I'm not counting the Witch of Endor scene in that, since it is supposed to be spiritualistic- as per general suppositions, her spiritualistic nature is extremely freaky and witch-like with her screaming and chanting and so forth [but try to remember all witchcraft is not so blatant]).

Remember these are wars and adultery, etc. and they are true to the Biblical account in that sense so they are not meant for family viewing.",1143417600,3,1711,4.746621621621622

900869,5,6304584954,"An action and adventure -filled epic about a distinguished military leader whose reign was touched by great scandal, shocking betrayals and rousing victories.  DAVID presents one of the Bible's most thrilling and ageless stories.

David (Nathaniel Parker, WIDE SARGASSO SEA) is a simple shepherd boy chosen as king of Israel under the watchful eyes of the prophets Samuel (Leonard Nimoy, STAR TREK) and Nathan.  His rise to power is met with great tests of adversity - from the battle with the Philistine giant, Goliath, to personal threat from King Saul (EVITA'S Jonathan Pryce).

David's 40-year rule is characterizeds by an unwavering desire to be ""a man aftyer God's own heart"" offset by his own ego and sense of entitlement and is plagued by tremendous battles, betrayals and loss - from his forbidden and passionate love with Bathsheba (Sheryl Lee, TWIN PEAKS) to his struggles with enemies both within and without.

DAVID is a powerful, action-packed, heroic tale that brings to vivid life one of the genuine heroes of the Bible.  The sixth in an award-winning series of Turner Original films based on the Old Testament.

900915,5,6304584954,"This is a marvelous production, filmed in Morocco, with wonderful costumes, textiles, and rustic sets, making this telling of King David's life visually believable. It has some standout performances, and Nathaniel Parker, always a favorite of mine, fares well as Israel's second king. As Saul, the casting of Jonathan Pryce is an odd choice (Saul was ""a head taller than his people"" and there was ""not a man more handsome than he"") but it works, and he is exceptional as the tormented and demented king.
Gideon Turner is very good as the young David, Dominic Rowan is a great bit of casting as Absalom, and as Joab, Maurice Roeves is terrific. Other notables play the two prophets, Leonard Nimoy, in an appealing and powerful portrayal of Samuel, and Franco Nero as a handsome Nathan.
Due to this being made for TV, some of the editing does not move smoothly (one assumes these are cuts for ads) but that aside, the photography is lovely (by Raffaele Mertes) and the melodic score by Carlo Siliotto enhances the mood (the final title music is by Ennio Morricone).
The story line picks up at 1 Samuel, Chapter 9, with Saul looking for his father's mules, and proceeds through much of both books of Samuel, often being quite faithful to them. It is interspersed with the occasional Psalm, and writer Larry Gross has blended scripture and dialogue quite effectively. It is interesting to watch this with Bible in hand, to see just how cleverly this has been done.
There are some moving scenes, like David's annointing, and his proposal to Abigail (played by the beautiful Lina Sastri). The only part that does not work for me is the story of Amnon; it is pieced together in an awkward and sluggish way, but fortunately does not last long, and the rest of the intricate story moves along at a quick pace, making this is a way above-average film for television.
There are a few gory battle scenes that would be too violent for the very young, but otherwise this is an excellent family film for older children, with the complexity of King David making it a fascinating story for discussion and repeated viewings.",1069459200,118,2106,4.741144414168938

900918,4,6304584954,"Although not quite a masterpiece like ""Abraham"" or ""Jesus of Nazareth"", this video is well worth getting as a good version of the story of King David - the ambiguous Israelite ruler who survived Goliath and King Saul but couldn't control his own sons, who is exalted for his famed friendship with Saul's son Jonathan but murders his innocent, loyal follower Uriah because he can't keep his hands off the poor man's wife Bathsheba.
It is, in a way, almost two stories - the first part dealing with David's glory days as God's golden child and the heartbreakingly tragic tale of Saul and Jonathan (an extremely well done subplot).  The second part deals with David's fall and the beginning of his rise from the ashes through his successor Solomon.  It's part two that makes this a bit different than most biblical stories because it is, quite frankly, a sordid, seedy mess.  Which is, of course, why it's so popular.  Admit it - it's the same kind of guilty fun you get when you read the front page of the tabloids while you're on the supermarket line.
It's more than that though.  Because the message here is that if David can be redeemed - and he was worse than alot of us in many ways - we can be too.
Some people complained about accuracy, but I didn't catch any major discrepancies myself.  With a note that this is not for children (remember any of part 2 from Sunday School except maybe an edited version of Absalom's revolt?) this is recommended.",1016496000,100,1452,4.565384615384615

There is far more action in this earlier film, which brings me to the point in this review. It must have been stymied by that wretched breed: ACCOUNTANTS! a pox on them! There was far too much in the production that smacked of cost-saving, particularly the 'Goliath' scene which rendered it incomprehensible c.f. the Bible account. Now that I have that off my chest, they have redeemed themselves by employing great actors. I particulaly liked the portrayal of Saul by Jonaththan Price. They could have added another 30 mins. or so to the 1st. part and issued it separately as 'SAUL', then a 2 part series on 'DAVID'. Jonathan's effective portrayal of a man going from greatness to madness is worth the price of the video alone. Leonard Nimoy also portrays the prophet Samuel very well as a compassionate man of God who must stick to principle, no matter how much it grieves his soul. As other reviewers have stated, too much is missed out. Overall, good acting makes up for the short-fall in detail, worth buying, get the 1985 version as well!",992217600,20,1152,4.707920792079208

The Bible says that the battle was witnessed by the Israelite army and by the Philistines. And, Goliath didn't have the armor or description that the holy scriptures portrayd him. And, the Bible also says that Samuel annointed the young David in front of his father and brotheren, not in the middle of the wilderness. Overall, I give this David 3 stars.
