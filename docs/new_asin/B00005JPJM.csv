7941952,5,B00005JPJM,"If I remeber well, it was a very good movie, full of excellent action. It was well acted, the plot had some flaws, but which plot doesn't? I loved the way he handled that big Mauser pistol with wonderful fluidity, and the final scene was fantastic. All in all a film to remeber.",1333584000,4,278,4.264150943396227
7941953,5,B00005JPJM,I watched this film while working in a movie theatre in 65-66 and was thoroughly impressed. It was very unique for its genre. It had a plot that really and truly only slightly paid homage to the James Bond flicks. I would really love to find it on DVD where I can relive the days.,1295395200,3,280,4.109090909090909
7941954,2,B00005JPJM,"It's a Brit B movie that was made on a shoestring budget. That being said the movie is an absolute must for guys who have a thing for Broomhandle Mauser pistols. The plot is lame and the ultra low budget shows, but the final gun battle at the end between the two spies was so good it should have been put in a better movie!",1226966400,,323,3.9846153846153847
7941955,4,B00005JPJM,I saw this when it was first released and I loved it. It is so like and yet unlike James Bond that it stand alone as the best parody of the spy films ever made. Tom Adams is spot on as the spy and one can not miss the party scene or the shoe scene toward the end of the film. I can hardly wait for this to come out on DVD so that I can relieve those days on Hampstead Heath.,1209600000,3,374,3.573170731707317
7941956,3,B00005JPJM,"... even if all it confirms is my faulty memory and rose-coloured glasses and so forth. i saw this film on our ancient b&w teevee. a gritty spy flick. not as realistic as a le carre adaptation, perhaps. also not as twee as a roger moore bond film.

it gets three stars as i'm so unsure about my memories. it may actually be a really bad film, but i remember being really cool ...",1180656000,3,379,4.121621621621622
