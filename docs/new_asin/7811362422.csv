7900538,5,7811362422,"This is an excellent movie about the resistance to Nazies/fascists in Rome, Italy, during the Second World War. It seems so true to life that it could be mistaken for a documentary. The characters are human, you know and like those of the underground. Some die, there is tragedy and bravery; and betrayal too. The movie is up-beat despite the tragic end to some of the members of the resistance.",1279411200,,395,4.6571428571428575
