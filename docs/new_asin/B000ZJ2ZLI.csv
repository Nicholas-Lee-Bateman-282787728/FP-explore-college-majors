3041903,5,B000ZJ2ZLI,"This show is a pleasure to get re-acquainted with. I didn't really watch it on television as often as I might have liked back in the 90s, but 11:30 was a bit late for me (still is!). A friend, back in those days, referred to CBS's ""Crime Time after Prime Time"" shows- most of which had male protagonists called Nick- as ""Nick at Night""! I would ask, ""Which one is it tonight? Nick the vigilante Judge, Nick the vampire cop, or Nick the hippie private eye?"" Well, Nick the Hippie Private Eye was always my favorite. The show is fun, serious at the appropriate moments (without becoming too serious), and funny most of the time without descending into parody. Rob Stewart and Carolyn Dunn are rare treasures. He is wasted in guest shots; he should have his own regular show, period.
He can carry one, easily. She could do the same, and her O.T.T. serious Sylvie is a perfect foil for ne'er-do-well, ladykiller Nick. Tropical Heat- or Sweating Bullets, as I first knew it and prefer to call it- is not unlike Magnum, P.I. (I've been known to refer to Nick Slaughter as the low-rent Magnum!), and if you like Magnum, you'll probably like Sweating Bullets for the same reasons.

8235568,5,B000ZJ2ZLI,"Remember the past, not too far back, the early 1990's, how life was then in comparison to now, the present day? Back when the U.S. Political and Economic Sectors weren't so screwed up. Back before the Craporate American Media Take-over and Rubbish, Fake So-Called- Reality-Shows and Fake Celebrity Television Programming started bombarding the air-waves?
If you remember this and how much more casual and relaxed life was, not up-tight like it is today, then this ""Tropical Heat TV Series"" will bring back those feel good days.
Watching these DVD's and remembering better days will definitely bring back memories of better times.
"" Kick back, pop in a DVD and relax. Let P.I.'s Nick Slaughter and Sophie Girrard their friend Spider and Cast and Crew take you on some Great Private Investigation Adventures. I'm sure you'll be glad you did. Enjoy!""",1390953600,,847,5.057142857142857
8235569,5,B000ZJ2ZLI,I used to watch Tropical Heat: Sweating Bullets late at night.  I was thrilled when it came out on DVD.  It's a good private eye type show.,1346630400,,139,4.111111111111111
8235570,5,B000ZJ2ZLI,"I really am enjoyng these DVDs.  I hadn't heard of this show before but for the price, I went for it and I'm so glad I did!!
I think anyone that purchases this series will not be sorry.  Don't let the present low price make you think it is indicative of the quaity of the show because it's not!!!  MOST OF ALL, NICK IS HOT!!",1334707200,,324,3.953846153846154
8235571,5,B000ZJ2ZLI,"I was so excited to find this series. It brought back so many memories from when I was a teen. My kids even walk around singing the theme song

8235572,3,B000ZJ2ZLI,"In the Canadian-made private eye series SWEATING BULLETS, Rob Stewart is Nick Slaughter, a ponytailed Mel Gibson clone of some charm. Whether working on a case or not, Nick saunters around an imaginary Florida Key with one of his hundreds of busy-print shirts always unbuttoned, so we can see that tan and sexy chest hair.

Nick's double-batch redhead partner Sylvie Girard (Carolyn Dunn), she of the entrancing blue eyes, sports flimsy blouses padded at the shoulders like an NFL lineman (it was the style back then). Sorry, her shirts are buttoned, guys. Sylvie sneers at Nick's many romantic escapades but we know despite protests to the contrary that the lady wants to climb into bed with him, too.

Nick's English-born buddy is Ian Stewart (John David Bland), a bleach-blonde ex-musician who owns a dive shop and tiki bar on the beach where all the babes  congregate. Nick often stops by long enough for a blast and to pick up tonight's bed warmer. (Ian's hangout, Tropical Heat, is also the show's American name.)

The stories are escapist fluff with easy-to-solve plots, ideal for non-Floridians mired down in the wintry north. We locals however can get distracted by this show's inaccuracies (like vehicles with front license plates or low mountains and non-native trees), and tend to watch with bemused tolerance.

Technically, these dubs are imperfect and sometimes blurry. Episode One has stereo music but all voices are extreme left channel. The fifth show of Season One is missing its credit scroll music. Show #8 is interrupted by a commercial bumper. And so on.

Despite such limitations, the price is right. I'm satisfied with this purchase, and if you favor intellectually untaxing whodunits decorated with beautiful bodies in Technicolor wardrobes, SWEATING BULLETS just may be for you, as well.",1315526400,2,1813,5.108108108108108
8235573,3,B000ZJ2ZLI,"It is like some sort of weird, budget, low brow lite mix of Magnum PI, Moonlighting, Miami Vice, and soft porn.
Presumably it filled a void when all those other great shows had just ended their runs in the late 80's. Nick Slaughter delivers his lines like a mix of David Addison, Hawkeye Pierce and Mike Hammer. It is total escapism and because of this and it's mix of influences I enjoy sitting down, relaxing, and watching an episode or two when I just want to switch off my brain for a while. The new character Spider in season two is an annoying little knob, the guy playing bartender in the first season was better. This shows weaknesses are it's strengths, so if you can get over the low budget and some dodgy acting (Nick and Sylvie are OK though), you can sink in to it and have some fun.

The quality of the DVD image is not that good, it was originally filmed on video by the looks of it and compressed to DVD. The audio on the first episode was only coming out of one channel. So overall it is probably a bit over priced as a DVD set, but that didn't stop me buying it cause I knew I was going to have fun. This show could easily diassapear wthout a trace so best to grab it while you can if you want it is my suggestion.",1284336000,2,1232,4.133333333333334
8235574,4,B000ZJ2ZLI,"If you're fond of lightweight, comedic detective shows set in tropical climes (think Magnum or VIP or the uber-kitschy Acapulco HEAT), you'll like this one. The transfers are a bit pixelated, but who cares? (At 8 shows per disk, that's hardly surprising.) My wife and I particularly love watching it in winter, when the fictional Key Mariah looks like a little bit of heaven. As someone else observes, there are no mountains in the Florida Keys, but that just adds to the show's cheesy charm. (It was shot, I believe, in a different location each season--Mexico, Israel (!), and South Africa.)",1275004800,2,593,4.881188118811881
8235575,5,B000ZJ2ZLI,"I used to watch this show in the early 90s when it was part of Crime Time after Prime Time. I love the laid-back style, scenery and architecture. (It was filmed in Mexico, not the Keys.) It strongly influenced my decorating style (palm tree paintings, beautiful colors, wooden shutters, and white stucco.)

If nothing else, ""Nick Slaughter"" in a wife-beater or an open shirt is worth the purchase price, and there is plenty of scenery for the men, as well. It's a light-hearted escape that will leave you feeling like you've spent a few hours in an adirondack chair on the beach, umbrella drink in hand. I highly recommend it!",1272499200,2,626,4.6909090909090905
8235576,3,B000ZJ2ZLI,"Okay so I own the series and yes it is light entertainment with attractive characters BUT having spent plenty of time in the Florida Keys I have always found it disconcerting when they keep telling us it's Florida WHERE, INCIDENTALLY , WE DO NOT HAVE MOUNTAINS etc..notice those shots across the ""ocean"" with the scenic view of things that just aren't Florida.  For fun  and it is worth the price..",1240531200,,398,4.671428571428572
