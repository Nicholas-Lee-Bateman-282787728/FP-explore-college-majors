4155893,4,B003MSYXMS,"This 2000 Met production is mostly very enjoyable. James Levine leads a well-paced, vividly dramatic performance, and he draws impeccable playing from the orchestra. But stylistically he is surprisingly old-fashioned. He indulges his singers excessively, with big ritards at the end of arias and numerous slowdowns for high notes. In this day of stylistic awareness, it's a bit surprising to hear trills begun on the principal note and other graces incorrectly executed; vocal embellishment is minimal. As for the cast, the three ladies are excellent. I especially liked Solveig Kringelborn's Elvira. The voice is bright, clear, and flexible, and she nails the coloratura, especially the exposed passagework in ""Mi tradi"". She also makes this basket-case character believable. Rene Fleming is a noble, passionate Anna, beautifully sung. ""Non mi dir"" is sung with remarkable breath control, but I'd like to hear clearer runs both here and in the Sextet. Hei-Kyung Hong is a well-sung, charming Zerlina, though she mugs too much for the audience. Ferruccio Furlanetto's Leporello has the same problem, and he often settles for a sort of sprechstimme when straight-out singing would be more to the point. But this is a mostly successful performance. Paul Groves brings a lovely lyric tenor to Ottavio's thankless part; again, I'd like clearer runs in ""Il mio tesoro"". John Relyea's Masetto is sung and acted to perfection, and Sergei Koptchak is suitably sonorous as the Commendatore. Surprisingly, the weak link in the cast is the title role. Bryn Terfel is certainly a fine singer and actor, with a real star quality. But I'm not sure Don Giovanni is his role. He sings reasonably well; he has the requisite power and does some lovely soft singing. But the voice is not particularly nimble, and fast passages can sound clumsy. ""Finch' han del vino"" is very approximate, more a sketch than a performance. As to his character, I don't like it. Terfel obviously can't do anything about his size, but he looks like a hulking brute, and despite his efforts toward sophistication he comes off as more a rapist than the suave seducer Mozart's music tells us he is. Of course, this may be partly due to the direction. This was, after all, a Zefferelli production reworked by another director. The stage movement and physical business throughout is notably lacking in grace and poise. (Having recently watched the wonderfully elegant Haitink/Glyndebourne ""Figaro"" may have made me more sensitive to this ...) Zefferilli's abstract sets are effective, and the costumes are gorgeous. So, an enjoyable but not entirely satisfying performance.",1312329600,4,2629,5.202830188679245
4155894,5,B003MSYXMS,"Best production of this masterpiece I've ever seen.
I've never seen, or heard, a better Leporello than
Furlanetto, and the only Giovanni I've ever seen
that could rival Terfel was Cesare Siepi. My only
complaint is that Masetto was dressed like a noble
rather than the peasant that he is.",1303257600,4,288,4.78
4155895,5,B003MSYXMS,My I love the intelligentsia of opera on Amazon and always choose my DVDs based on everyone's very thoughtful commentary. This is a perfect opera....so perfect that I wanted to understand every word sung. There were times it seems that these greater performers sang for a full minute or two without a single sub-title causing us to guess what they were saying or interpolate from previous sub-titles. Please MET no cliff notes sub-titles....give us the full libretto so we can fully enjoy the genius of these operas.,1300233600,4,516,4.942528735632184
4155896,5,B003MSYXMS,"This fabulous 2000 production of Don Giovanni is the best - bar none.  I have seen many, many productions of this greatest of all operas and none come even close to this brilliantly cast production.  Outstanding are Solvieg Kringelborn, who nearly (but not quite) steals the show as a very funny! Donna Elvira and Paul Groves, much more sympathetic than usual in the role of Don Ottavio.  Fleming, Hong, Relyea and Koptchak are terrific.  But, Don Giovanni lovers literally haven't lived until they see and hear the matchless pair of Bryn Terfel as the Don and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Leporello.  They both possess wonderful voices and first-class acting chops. In fact, IMO, Furlanetto is a comic genius and the best actor in opera.  The fact that both Terfel and especially Furlanetto are very attractive men doesn't hurt either,I could watch them forever.",1285804800,12,858,5.007042253521127
4155897,5,B003MSYXMS,"There! I've said it! And I won't take it back! Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"" fulfills the ideal of opera more convincingly than any other: great music and great theater, plus a depth of 'intellectual interest' unmatched by any opera from its debut until the 20th C. I never miss a staging of Don Giovanni in any city I happen to be in at the right time, and I have now five productions of it on DVD.

This 2000 CE production by Franco Zeffirelli at the New York Met is a fantastic success on DVD: good camera-work and good sound recording of a visually lavish 'period' staging. Oddly enough, given the amount of griping one hears about modernized Euro-trash stagings, this ripely traditional staging has one one review before mine on amazon and iisn't one of the ""hot"" sellers. Go figure!

The only musical weakness comes right at the start, in the overture, when conductor james Levine gasps and grimaces like Toad of Toad Hall to coax some energy from his pit, where the instrumentalists do seem to be weary and their timbres more proper than exhilarating. Once the curtain rises, however, the magic of Mozart prevails. This is a superb ""singing"" cast, all of whom deliver dramatically as well. And they all bear looking at, even in close-up. Best of all, this is a well-rehearsed ensemble with natural theatrical blocking. Not one singer just spreads her/his arms and bellows an aria full-face.

Ferruccio Furlanettos shines dramatically as Leoporello, the principal ""giocoso"" role in this Dramma Giocoso - Joking Drama - that rivals the darkest of Shakespeare's tragicomedies. Furlanetto is so effective as an actor that one almost forgets to notice how well he sings the part.

Don Ottavio is often the weakest role in stagings of Don Giovanni, though as the leading tenor voice he has some of the most beautiful music to sing. But Ottavio is almost always portrayed as an ineffective 'wuss'. Paul Groves has the physical stature to play Ottavio as a 'bella figura', a man of stout character and careful judgment. Dramatically, I'd say he's the most convincing Ottavio I've ever seen, and he sings convincingly also.

Basso Sergei Koptchak is commendably grave as the Commendatore. Soprano Hei-kyung Hong is slyly vivacious as the lovely peasant girl Zerlina, whom Don Juan schemes to possess on her wedding day, and John Relyea portrays the abused, resentful bridegroom Masetto as both manly and a bit sappy. Theirs are ""giocoso"" roles, but they imbue their characters with enough humanity to deserve empathy, and one should remember that their plight under the oppressive aristocrat Giovanni, and their resistance to class oppression, amounted to 'radical politics' in Mozart's Austria. Of the three female singers in this cast, Hong has the best control of her voice, the closest to ""historically informed"" vocal technique, in an unapologetically modern musical context.

Donna Elvira, the victim of an earlier seduction who comes stalking her betrayer, is often sung by an aging overweight diva as a broadly comic virago. Her ambivalence toward Don Giovanni is indeed comical, but her role in the opera is better served by a depiction of sincere emotions, of a poignantly obsessive love turning to hate. Her aria begging for mercy for her seducer is critical in the dramatic interpretation of this opera; through her lovesick eyes, we see Don Giovanni as the magnificent male animal he had to be and not just as an unrepentant sinner in a morality play. Solveig Kringelborn is attractive enough, and actress enough, to make her pivotal role effective. She's absurd, yes of course, but she's also plausibly sympathetic.

Renee Fleming is a star of the fifth magnitude, whose singing doesn't always please me. But she's at her best in the role of Donna Anna. She looks the part, she acts the part with dignity, her interaction with her suitor Don Ottavio makes their tragically stalled romance emotionally plausible. Her vocal timbre is too broad for my taste, with the effect of making her pitch sound unfocused at times, but I have to admit that she sings this part, this time, quite beautifully.

And now we come to Bryn Terfel in the role of Don Giovanni. His singing is beyond quibble - stupendous even when he stumbles on the tempo in his tempestuous scene-closing aria ""Fin ch'han del vino"". His dramatic portrayal of Don Giovanni is a masterpiece of specific, consistent interpretation. His Giovanni is a raw sexual predator, a brute, a hateful narcissist empowered by class status and wealth to demand satisfaction of every appetite. He's a glutton and and a sadistic bully as well as a seducer. Terfel is magnificently ugly and yet reeks of testosterone. Filming his performance, catching his smirks and glares in close-up, affords us ""home"" audience members a sense of how potent his acting really was, there on stage where the live audience could hardly have appreciated it. Terfels' Giovanni is truly a nasty  scoundrel who deserves to be carried off to Hell.

That's my only reservation about this splendid Don Giovanni. It simplifies the moral drama more than I would choose. My own concept of Don Giovanni is no less damnable but somewhat more ambiguous. He's closer to Faust in his defiance of social conventions and restrictions. There should be something almost Promethean about his refusal to submit to any authority outside himself. Terfel's Giovanni is tough, fiercely brave, scornful of any weakness, but in the end just a hormone-powered bully full of himself. His demise is no tragedy. Good riddance! But there's something in the Don Juan character that humanity has always admired. Women do fall in love with him. Men do need to come to terms with him. That's the intellectual, psychological depth of this opera, that makes it the greatest ever composed.",1276905600,51,5781,4.981347150259067
4155898,5,B003MSYXMS,"I have seen and heard many performances of Don Giovanni and this is unquestionably the best that I have experienced.  The opera, like almost all of Mozart's operas, rises or falls based on the excellence of the ensemble.  In this performance, the entire cast was outstanding and the singing was uniformly magnificent.  Sergej Kopcak and Paul Groves, as Massetto and Don Ottavio respectfully, both believably played dashing lovers seeking revenge for assaults on their betrothed by the Don.  Renee Fleming was her normal exquisite self in the role of Donna Anna- regal, aggrieved, and in mourning over the death of her father.  Bryn Terfel made a fantastic Don, in turn charming, self-absorbed, and vicious.  Terfel's performance depicted a Don whose evil was beyond redemption.  Watching him exert his ""charms"" was like watching a train wreck that one cannot keep their eyes off of- a true achievement.  However, for me the most outstanding aspect of seeing this performance was becoming introduced to three singers who I was unfamiliar- Solveig Kringelborn as Donna Elvira, Hong Hei-Kyung as Zerlina, and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Leporello.  Solveig Kringelborn beautifully portrayed a woman who was both in love and had been wronged.  Hong Hei-Kyung did a terrific job playing a naive young woman when encountering a nobleman but then turned into an amorous coquette as she dealt with Masetto's jealousy.  I particularly liked Ferruccio Furlanetto as he acted as the Greek Chorus providing cynical context to the proceedings while maintaining the Don's huge book of female conquests.  Zeferrelli's staging provided additional richness to experiencing this opera.  All in all, this is a fabulous performance and I look forward to enjoying it on a regular basis.",1276387200,20,1761,5.268817204301075
4155929,5,B003MSYXMS,The customs of the time add so much to the opera and the privileged voices of Terfel as the hated wretched and Fleming  bring superiority to the production difficult to match. James Levine is the conductor of The Hew York Metropolitan Opera.

4155930,5,B003MSYXMS,"My mother loves opera, so I buy her operas for Christmas.  She really, really, really loves Don Giovanni and when I asked her which one she wanted, this was the one.  The only one she wanted.

4155931,5,B003MSYXMS,"I'm sure that the performance is worth all the stars it gets. But why so expensive? Even at the Met Opera Shop, it's only $40, and $36 if you're a member of the Met Opera Guild.

4155932,3,B003MSYXMS,"This is not widescreen. It is older. The not-widescreen is not very good despite the good performances.

The performances of the orchestra and singers are phenomenal. The orchestra is soaring with precise expression. The production/stage/costumes are not as exciting as other productions or shows that sacrifice singing just a tad for charisma. I thought Don Giovanni maybe should be a bit younger and slimmer. The somewhat dark and slightly drab clothing and staging looks like a typical opera stage and not a ""wow"" vibrant set. Also, again, the video is not full widescreen much of the time.

Overall, this may have great singing performances available on DVD but not the best widescreen production.

4155933,4,B003MSYXMS,"The controversial yet classic opera, Don Giovanni, was masterfully performed by The Metropolitan Opera.  Mozarts music was skillfully and precisely presented in this enactment, and the libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte was sung with grandeur and sensitivity.  The actors and actresses executed their roles in a very convincing manner that allowed the audience to enter into the deceitful, wicked, and lustful life of Don Giovanni.
 The production commenced with a rousing and moving overture by the orchestra.  The conductor, James Levine, did a splendid job of directing the ensemble.  The orchestras unity was superb within itself, but it was also extremely tight with the soloists on stage.  The contrasting sections throughout the entire opera were executed with accuracy and excellence.  The balance between the woodwinds, brass, strings, and percussion was ideal.
 The vocalists delivered a fabulous performance.  Each of the performers voices soared with beauty and clarity.  The arias were presented with grandeur.  The soloists personified their characters with exactitude by means of passionate facial expressions and fervent singing.
 As the first scene opened with the character Leporello, the conditions were already set for a stellar performance.  Ferruccio Furlanetto, who played Leporello, achieved his goal of the somewhat mischievous but faithful servant of Giovanni through his exceptional acting and soaring arias.
 Don Giovannis character, played by Bryn Terfel, was portrayed as an obsessive individual with a desire to conquer women throughout the entire opera.  His voice rose above and beyond, and his face exemplified the evil desires in his heart as his eyes locked upon innocent women.  During a particular scene where Leporello explained to Donna Elvira the extent of Giovannis conquests, Terfel masterfully crafted an absolutely malevolent display across his face.  It was a gaze filled with an unquenchable lust, the gaze of a man who lived to prey upon any woman who was unfortunate enough to fall under his seductive tactics.
 Renee Fleming, who played Donna Anna, was very successful in her attempt to depict a woman who had lost her father to a murderous rapist.  She beautifully sang with passion and expression that allowed her to evoke empathy from her listeners.  For example, her aria following the Commendatores death, conveyed the deep sorrow that coursed through her characters being.  In a different scene when Donna Anna was struck with the realization that she had just encountered her fathers murderer, her voice soared with fear and urgency as she related her feelings to her fianc&eacute;, Don Ottavio.
 Solveig Kringelborn, Donna Elvira, revealed the heart of a woman who was scorned by her lover.  Her characters anger, bitterness, and deep wounds pierced the hearts of the audience.  Amidst the first appearance of Donna Elvira, her aria revealed her resentful heart that Don Giovanni had broken into pieces and abandoned.  The emotion portrayed on her face related the pain emanating from her soul as Leporello divulged his masters conquests.
 The young peasant bride, Zerlina, was represented throughout the opera as an inexperienced girl by the professional enactment of Hei Kyung Hong.  Her nervous and nave actions were exposed with Don Giovanni, yet her seductive powers were displayed with Masetto.  Amid Masettos physical pain inflicted on him by Don Giovanni, young Zerlinas voice masterfully lures her husband out of his intense pain and into sensuality with his wife.
 The male roles in the opera were also skilled singers and actors.  John Relyea, as Masetto, displayed the character of a young bridegroom exasperated and disturbed with the situation before him regarding his beloved Zerlina.  Don Ottavios character, played by Paul Groves, fulfilled his role as the concerned yet inept fianc&eacute; of Donna Anna.  Lastly, Sergei Koptchak, the Commendatore, did an admirable job, through song and drama, of depicting the authoritative father of Donna Anna who brings the impending judgment on Don Giovanni.  His severe and courageous character is revealed through his demeanor, and it is perceived through the tone of his singing.
Throughout the entire opera, the technical aspects were handled exceptionally. The lighting was appropriate for each scene and mood.  During the more jovial scenes, the lighting was brighter and more welcoming, such as in the scene of Zerlinas peasant wedding.  On the other hand, during more intense scenes, such as in Don Giovannis death at the end of the opera, the lighting was dark and dismal, reflecting fear and judgment.
 The staging was also outstanding, containing multiple, elaborate backdrops which aided in making the stage appear life-like.  Each transition between scenes flowed remarkably well.
The costumes of the vocalists were elaborate, adorned, and striking.  The outfits revealed to the audience the distinction between the individuals who were of high society and those who were lowly.
This controversial yet classic opera has managed to be a topic of debate for two centuries.  This opera has continued to captivate its audience since its debut in 1787.  Don Giovanni somehow manages to mesmerize its audience not only with the main characters crafty, seductive ways, but also through his ability to escape judgment and consequences until the end.  This rebel obtains the audiences admiration as well as their disdain.  During this production, Don Giovanni was presented as an egoistic human being who was willing to sacrifice the livelihood of others for his own selfish ambitions.  At times, pure evil is exposed in his demeanor.  To some extent, the Metropolitan Opera achieved the goal of creating an appealing interest in Don Giovanni by divulging his shrewd and manipulative abilities.  On the other hand, due to how evil and obsessive his character remained throughout the opera, the audience felt disgust and repulsion.
This DVD did an outstanding job of bringing the opera to life.  The videography was superb, and the sound quality was clear.  Each scene was performed very convincingly and with superiority.  The Metropolitan Opera did a masterful job presenting Don Giovanni to the public.  From the unity of the ensemble to the decorative stage, Don Giovanni, was a stellar performance.",1386806400,7,6315,5.355983772819473
4155934,5,B003MSYXMS,"In yet another outstanding production, the Metropolitan Opera staged the timeless classic, Don Giovanni, with tremendous success. Look no further than this stage production for an enjoyable and realistic experience of Mozarts masterpiece. Under the management of stage director Stephen Lawless, producer Franco Zeffirelli, and music director James Levine, world-renowned performers and experts came together to provide entertainment characterized by professionalism and excellence.
This DVD format holds to nothing less and seems to place the viewer within the opera house itself. The audience is brought into the action as the camera angles bring face to face interaction with acclaimed singers such as Bryn Terfel, Ferruccio Furlanetto, and Renee Fleming.
For as long as this opera has been staged, the complex character of the protagonist, Don Giovanni, has been the subject of much deliberation and has been rendered differently across many productions. Is he a villain or a hero, and how does that assumption affect the individual traits directors give this protagonist? Terfel plays the role of Don Giovanni in the Met production and is portrayed as a forceful, borderline abusive philanderer who sweet talks his way into any womans heart. To further build on this persona and make Giovannis conquests look more repulsive, Lawless depicts the Don as an older, unattractive man with an aggressive sexual drive.
Based on this interpretation, the Met production leans to one side of the question and portrays the protagonist as more of a scoundrel and less of a hero. Yet his character remains intriguing as he skillfully masks these villainous qualities by unscrupulously deceiving women with honeyed words and by manipulating the minds of those around him to see him as innocent. Through Giovannis intricate nature, viewers are provided with the unique opportunity to observe the workings of the corrupt yet intelligent mind.
At Giovannis side, the comical servant Leporello, played by Ferruccio Furlanetto, displays the essence of his own personality in the famous aria, Madamina, il catalogo  questo. Paul Groves, a tenor with flawless technique, stars as Don Ottavio, while John Reylea, as Masetto, realistically and convincingly expresses his feelings of love and betrayal. Key to the climactic scenes is the Commendatore, played by Sergei Koptchak. With a booming bass voice that compliments his strong, stone-cold appearance, Koptchak significantly contributes to the frightening tone of the final scenes of judgment.
The female roles also hold to this standard of excellence. Renee Fleming, who plays Donna Anna, exhibits incredible vocal ability as she effortlessly ascends and descends octaves in her arias. Solveig Kringelborn, as Donna Elivra, embraces the totality of her character, convincingly showing the conflicted nature of Elivra as she questions whether she hates or loves Giovanni. Finally, viewers fall in love with the sweet spirit and singing voice of the somewhat nave Zerlina, played by Hei-Kyung Hong.
Building upon the talent of the actors and actresses, Sylvia Nolan takes this production to the next level with phenomenal costumes fitting for both the time period and social class of the characters. The bold colors and brilliant materials used for the outfits are eye-catching and complement Mozarts dazzling music.
While Franco Zeffirellis extremely large and magnificent set construction has the ability to distract from the music at times, the beauty of his work leaves the viewer awestruck. From the gorgeous mural backdrops, to the moving set pieces, to the intricately designed structures, nothing could be added to improve the panoramic image.
A major contribution to the excellent quality of this production is the superb videography by Wayne Chouinard. Viewers are brought closer to the action and notice facial expressions, slight gestures, and prop details that one would not be able to detect by sitting in the opera house. In addition to this, the multiple camera angles keep the audience interested and engaged.
The Metropolitan Opera does justice to this timeless classic which has been hailed as one of the best operas ever composed. The exceptional cast, orchestra, and directors bring Mozarts music to life, and extraordinary set designs and costumes bring the viewers to the edge of their seats.  Terfels rendering of Don Giovanni emotionally engages viewers which takes this production to a level above pure entertainment. Musical specialists and lay opera-goers alike highly praise and recommend the Metropolitan Operas production of Don Giovanni.",1386201600,3,4603,5.48169014084507
4155935,5,B003MSYXMS,"Mozarts Don Giovanni has been hailed around the world as the greatest opera of all time.  Countless opera companies have performed W. A. Mozart and Lorenzo da Pontes masterpiece.  Spawning numerous debates as to the true role of its protagonist, it is often prominently featured in music appreciation texts and college music history courses.  The Metropolitan Operas marvelous traditional production of this classic opera is directed by Stephen Lawless, with musical direction by James Levine, and features an exceptional cast of singers from around the world.

Bryn Terfel, Ferruccio Furlanetto, and Renee Fleming are all renowned opera stars and have performed in a variety of productions, ranging from Mozartian and Wagnerian opera to concert performances of musicals.  Terfels role as Don Giovanni is a blend of sensuality, manic brutality, and arrogance who fully deserves his fate.  Although Terfel is not extremely attractive, his acting and voice, which exude menace, humor, and seduction, make up for this deficiency.  Furlanettos Leporello is comedic without being over the top, and Fleming is a beautifully voiced, passionate Donna Anna.

Norwegian soprano Solveig Kringelborn delivers an excellent performance as Donna Elvira.  Her tragic yet comic portrayal of a woman enraged, yet still hopelessly in love, is engaging and utterly believable.  Tenor Paul Groves portrays a dignified yet devoted Don Ottavio, and Sergei Koptchaks Commendatore is an imposing and stoic figure in his stone armor.  Hei-Kyung Hong and John Relyea are a delightful Zerlina and Masetto.  The excellent acting throughout Don Giovanni is accentuated by the wonderful orchestra and intricate sets and costumes.

As expected, the Metropolitan Operas set design and costumes are extraordinary.  Franco Zeffirellis mammoth yet highly detailed sets create incredibly realistic and visually stimulating backdrops which smoothly transitioned from one scene to the next.  The gorgeous eighteenth century costumes designed by Sylvia Nolan, along with period guns and swords, and real food, add to the authenticity of the opera.  Donna Anna and Donna Elvira, however, change costumes more than necessary, for the events of the opera occur over a period of two days at most.

Stephen Lawlesss staging is outstanding; for every action, there is a credible reaction.  The staging creatively conquers several implausible situations, such as when Leporello fools Donna Elvira into thinking he is Don Giovanni. The finale, however, is unimpressive.  The spectacular sets and prior effects seem to indicate that there will be an equally astounding and detailed descent into Hell.  Instead, Don Giovanni slowly sinks underneath the banquet table, surrounded by billowing smoke.
The lighting and videography are exceptional.  Although the camera angles are mostly close-ups, there are several full stage shots that allow the viewer to appreciate the vast set.  The ensemble balance is also wonderful.  James Levines conducting of the orchestra and chorus is excellent as expected.  The orchestra sensitively accompanies and accents the performance of the singers.

The character of Don Giovanni, and by extension the tone of the entire opera, can be viewed in two distinct ways:  either Giovanni is a villain who deserves his punishment, or he is a hero who dies for his beliefs.  The first view, which aligns with the operas alternative title, The Reprobate Punished, portrays Giovanni as a rapist and murderer.  The second views Don Giovanni as the embodiment of Enlightenment ideals of reason and the individual defying rank, convention, superstition, and church.  As an opera giocoso, Don Giovannis blend of comedic and serious elements creates a complicated protagonist with both heroic and villainous tendencies.

Mozarts Giovanni is neither a pure hero nor a despicable villain, but a production will tend toward one end of the spectrum or other.  Bryn Terfels interpretation of the role tends toward the latter.  His Giovanni is clearly full of himself and confident in his ability to woo any woman.  His murder of the Commendatore is executed with manic glee, and there are several scenes when he nearly rapes a woman, such as his second attempt at seducing Zerlina.  Although Terfels Don is clearly a villain, he still has heroic tendencies.  He has no concept of fear; he faces his accusers at the end of Act I and the statue of the Commendatore during the operas finale with absolute confidence.

The productions stellar cast, spectacular sets, and intricate costumes make this Don Giovanni a particularly memorable one.  Bryn Terfels portrayal of the iconic, villainous Don, along with the excellent performances of his costars, bring da Pontes libretto to life, and Levines masterful conducting does Mozarts score justice.  The Metropolitans traditional yet stunning rendition of this popular opera is highly recommended.",1386028800,,4905,5.447682119205298
4155936,5,B003MSYXMS,"Don Giovanni, a true classic, has been performed countless times since its debut in 1786.  Few, however, meet the standard this version by the Metropolitan Opera sets in interpretation, quality, and aesthetic interest.  The time-honored comic opera skillfully entertains and enlightens with its story of the deeds and eventual justice of the young Don, portrayed as a villainous hero, who with his oozing charisma draws women away from their commitments into his world of restless defiance against morality.  The Met skillfully recreates the drama of the well-known scenes, from Giovanni's allurement of the nave Zerlina from her groom, to Donna Elvira's lovelorn vengefulness, to Giovanni's final obstinate sinking into hell.

Producer and set designer Franco Zeffirelli, also director of the films Romeo and Juliet (1968) and Hamlet (1990), gives us an elaborately stunning show. The set construction is magnificent, yet tasteful and appropriate to Mozart's era.  The breathtaking cloud depiction in some scenes, detailed backdrops, and towering gates, while perhaps somewhat distracting, add to the drama of the occasion .  Light director Wayne Chouinard is, however, subtle and skilled in the lighting, which makes it look as if it is actually in the cool of the night or that we are really in a warmly well-lit palace.  The production is also terrifically well-acted, brought to life by the appropriate props and well-timed acting cues and signals from stage director Stephen Lawless.  Each player is well-suited to his or her part, and each is transformed into his or her character for the duration of the opera, with subtle and interesting expressions and natural movement.  All these parts would not cohere so tightly if it were not for the musical direction and interpretation of James Levine, who brings the music of Mozart home to the Metropolitan Opera House and lets Mozart's genius shine through the talented performers.

Bryn Terfel's Giovanni moves across the stage in his insidiously charming way, having a ruggedly attractive complexion despite his fatness, yet seducing women with the ease of settling into a bubbly hot tub.  Ferruccio Furlanetto plays his sidekick and comic voice-of-reason, Leporello, and brings out the ""naturalness"" in his acting that was so desired by Mozart in composing the music, and he helps the audience see the humor obscured by centuries of cultural differences.  Solveig Kringelborn's lively delivery is the scorned Donna Elvira, whose love-sick arias expose the true wildness of Giovanni, as opposed to the perspective of the simply unrepentant rake of a man. The seasoned Renee Fleming, as Donna Anna, and tenor Paul Groves, as Don Ottavio, bring a measure of tragic drama to the comic opera with their dignified and deeply-wronged characters, who always wear dark colors, solidified by their strong and serious performances.  The other couple, Hei-kyung Hong, as Zerlina, and John Relyea, as Masetto, act as the peasant lovers on their wedding day.  Hong plays Zerlina as a coyly spirited girl, blinded to her previous commitments by Giovanni's advances, but ever-faithful to her Masetto, expressed in her simple-hearted aria ""Vedrai carino."" Masetto in this version is a man of some substance, while still hurt, resentful, and self-centered. Through their acting and singing, they add to the opera's comic nature.

Despite a disparity in interpretation between audiences of today and viewers of Mozart's time, Don Giovanni remains captivating and powerful to viewers of any century, because it attempts to deal with universal themes of punishment, worldliness, and fidelity, if unsatisfactorily, solidifying its importance in the canon of operatic literature.  In the late 18th century, Don Giovanni contained more dramatic and provocative moments than any before, yet still contained humor throughout that was uproarious for the theater-goers of Mozart's time.  Modern audiences may interpret Don Giovanni's behavior completely differently from the humorous view of Mozart's contemporary audience of the young man with no self-control and few morals.  Mozart's original title, Il dissoluto punito, or ""The Rake Punished,"" reveals his possible intent to portray a dissipated young man, whose frivolous pursuits lead him to his demise in hell.  To some among today's viewers, however, Giovanni is ""lecherous and despicable, and we see him as a wicked, sensuously erotic seducer, a fascinating figure opposed to all moral restraints,""*  much altered from the original motive.  Above these differences in interpretation, Don Giovanni timelessly communicates to its viewers through the medium of masterful music the dangers of becoming involved with those who audaciously defy moral and social standards, and this production is a jewel among productions of Don Giovanni.

4155938,5,B003MSYXMS,"I purchased this Opera based on reviews alone.  All I have to say is that out of my nice collection of very esteemed Operas, this is by far, one of my favorite.  It can't be expressed enough how much the scenery affects the tone and quality of watching an Opera on your TV.  It seems they spared no expense on the staging.  Beautiful and fitting for the time.  The Costumes, perfect.  The Performers?  SPOT ON.  Beautiful voices, rich and well within their tonal range.  The orchestra had to be one of the highlights.  Flawless presentation of this opera.  This seems to be difficult to purchase, so if you are wanting to own a version of Don Giovanni that will fulfill your needs, I wouldn't bother searching any further.  My wife and I sat through and loved it.  My wife can barely stand an hour of an Opera, but she loved this one.",1327276800,6,834,4.407894736842105
8400493,2,B003MSYXMS,"Good aspects:
- It's no one's strongest work as an artist, but Terfel and Fleming turn in great performances in the roles of Giovanni and Anna. Fleming's final Act II aria was the winner of the evening for good reason. Hong was similarly pleasing in her role as Zerlina.
- One of the few productions in which Giovanni and Leporello look somewhat similar to one another. I'm surprised by how many directors let that aspect of the libretto go dismissed when casting.
- If one is searching for a non-controversial, traditional staging, this is a great resource to start with. This is all the more surprising from Zeffirelli, who I believe succeeded more in grand spectacle than intimate character dramas.

Not as good aspects:
- Groves is completely underwhelming as Ottavio, both vocally and dramatically. I'm aware that Ottavio is a tricky role to play in terms of agency, but Groves doesn't come to any conclusion that seems more interesting than the ones that come before or after him.
- The production's aesthetic is subsumed in Met 80's - 00's era browns, blacks, and grays. It is so completely dull to look at without any relief of active color in a artistic period of varied pastels with gilded edges. It's a dark story, but that doesn't mean that there can't be some visual relief, especially in the early action during Act I.
- Levine's tempi during this recording are wacky and often aren't backed up by the score. Oddly, there are several numbers in which coloraturic passages are slowed down for a small section of measures, rather than picking a slower tempo from the beginning of a number that would suit that singer's voice. Additionally, some numbers feature tempi faster than anything I've ever heard, particularly the beginning of the Act I finale.",1516147200,,1764,4.821782178217822

8400496,5,B003MSYXMS,"This is an almost perfect production of Don Giovanni.  Lucky for me I hadn't noticed it was Zeffirelli, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it.  I'm sure glad I did.

Here is what happened.  I went to the San Francisco Opera production this summer, which was perfectly dreadful.  Shall I give a quick run-down?  OK, in the comments.  Suffice it to say I had really gotten in the mood for Don Giovanni, even splurged for better seats, and came away COMPLETELY dissatisfied.  It left me with blueballs for Don Giovanni, and I needed a good one on video PDQ.

I chose this Metropolitan Opera production because it looked like a traditional production and I could see by the copyright date it was pre-Gelb.  (And any complaint I might make about San Francisco Opera, pales next to anything associated with Peter Gelb at the Met--that can be engraved in granite.)

Well, this Met/Zeffirelli production is just about the best darn Don Giovanni imaginable, and only after it was over did I see in the credits it was with Zefferelli as set and costume designer.  Now, it has been so long (the man is 94) ... but Zefferelli was one of my very early disliked directors.  (O, do I hate EVERYTHING about opera??  Not really!)  Everything he did, or almost everything he did, was so crusted up by unnecessary doo-dads, everywhere on stage.  I think one of his worst productions was the Met's Turandot, while although traditional, was so crusted up one could barely make out the main characters within the jumble.

This is not like that.  It is elegant, spare, traditional of course, but only what is needed to be completely elegant and traditional.  Frankly I couldn't believe it was Zeffirelli after I had seen it.  It proves I am wrong ... maybe about everything!  Anyway I shall have to keep an eye open and never again simply dismiss a Zeffirelli production.

The only thing I thought could be better was the going to hell scene.  That's what everyone's waiting for, a few flames.  All we got was a little pale orange-tinted steam ...",1502928000,,2022,4.6789772727272725
