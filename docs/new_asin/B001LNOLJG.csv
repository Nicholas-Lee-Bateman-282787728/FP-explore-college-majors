8326554,1,B001LNOLJG,"The one star rating is not for the movie itself but for the inferior crappy DVD-R disc it was transferred on.  It is an obvious bootleg and they can easily be spotted so lets look at the facts.  Film was transferred on a DVD-R disc used to burn movies,standard blue screen with DVD-R menu bar once you start movie DEAD GIVEAWAY IT'S A BOOTLEG,region free crappy inferior transfer.  May not even work on all DVD players because they can't handle crap discs.  Sinister Cinema is a shady company that does not sell official releases,they just make copies of old movies and sell them as if they owned the rights to them.  Don't make the same mistake I did,I threw mine in the trash upon discovering it was a bootleg and I plan on replacing it with a legit release.  There are better transfers on Amazon so don't even waste your money here.",1263254400,5,835,4.4605263157894735
8326555,4,B001LNOLJG,"""The Loreley's Grasp"" is a fun, cheesy horror movie import circa the mid-70's. A lot of the so-called plot is real rubbish, but it is pretty fun. The idea that a she-creature feeds, coming from under an under water dwelling, for 7 days on an all-girls school (who are mostly in bikinis, nighties, or bathing suits) makes for a fun and passable 80+ minutes. The actors are all cheesy in their bad dubbing. And the creature and gore fx are entertaining. This isn't meant to be taken serious. Go into it with mindset of it being an entertaining Euro schlock-fest, and you shouldn't be disappointed.

(Sinister Cinema's release is very respectable. The picture's great, and you shouldn't let the fact that this is a dvd-r release bother you. It's just as good as a commercial release from a huge company--but a lot cheaper! And I have nothing to do with the company, except that I've bought their product for a while now and have always thought of them as a very classy company with a great catalog of movies.)",1237680000,4,1006,4.620111731843576
