8063386,3,B0009N1MH8,"It wasn't what I had expected.  As I expected the program with Marcel Marceau and mime.
I haven't watched it.  The other problem is that there are no subtitles and I am deaf.

I think I'll keep it and gift it to someone.

Thanks again, Amazon.

That having been said, this group of episodes from The Red Skelton Show is a delightful collection. The picture quality is as best as could be remastered from 1950's TV master print. This quality is better than a copy of ""What's my Line?"" that I recently purchased. The 1st episode has a young Jamie Farr playing straight man to Skelton's inept sailor character, and Buster Crabbe as their Cheif Petty Officer. Any current or former Navy man or woman will get a kick out of Crabbe's reading from the drill manual. The other two episodes have Mickey Rooney as a defense attorney defending.... you guessed it- Freddie the Freeloader, and Jane Powell (who flubbs a line) as a princess.",1160438400,3,817,4.72027972027972
