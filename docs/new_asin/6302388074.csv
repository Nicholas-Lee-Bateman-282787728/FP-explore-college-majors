The video still has a nice sound and the concert is excellent.  I am glad that I purchased the VHS tape 20 years later because I am still a fan of the Cars. ""The Cars Live 1984-1985"" is worth buying.  The Cars splited up and Benjamin Orr formed his own group and Ric Ocasek went solo. Later, Benjamin Orr died of cancer of the pancreas in the year of 2000. I hope that someday the ""Cars"" will have a video with all their greatest hits.",1087516800,4,552,4.092592592592593

7825505,2,6302388074,"I suppose its because technology wasn't the best at the time, but the sound quality leaves much to be desired.  It gets a bit better as the tape goes on, but overall would much rather have a DVD.",1342483200,,195,4.131578947368421
7825506,5,6302388074,"This The Cars Live 1984 - 1985 [VHS]  concert from Houston needs to please be released on DVD. This is a great performance from the Houston Summit on September 11, 1984. We finally got an official release of the ""Heartbeat City"" video, now we need this one to add to our Cars DVD collection. Please.",1306713600,4,299,4.4363636363636365
7825507,5,6302388074,"It is a little puzzling why this great Cars gig is not available on DVD in it's complete form,as it's a fitting tribute to the band and to the late lamented Ben Orr. The last few years have seen a couple of Cars DVD's come out,The Cars Live DVD is great, the Unlocked DVD is a mixed bag,the music is great the documentary footage less so. It really is a wasted opportunity that this show isn't out on DVD it's so good. The whole concert is full of superb songs,but the live versions here of ""Just What I Needed"",""Moving In Stereo"",""Drive"" and ""Cruiser"" are as good as the records, which proves the band were a good live band. The band were criticized for lack of crowd interaction,but i think the moody look was part of the bands persona,which is what i loved about them. Go buy the VHS tape and transfer it to DVD,then you'll have a unspoilt copy of a great gig. A highly recommended concert.",1235520000,11,893,4.3532934131736525

7825509,5,6302388074,"I own this title on Laserdisc, issued by VideoArts Japan, concert filmed in Houston at the ? and is totally amazing. the digital signal on this LD is emphasized, for my high-end DAC processor engaged in DeEmph mode and sounded wonderful. My lower end pioneer elite LD player prior did not have de-emphasis capability and the concert was a little on the harsh- bright side. This is one helluva show at the bands pinnacle career and sound wise, for they were sharp and were on fire. My favorite LD. Run for nearly 200 when they surface once in a blue moon on e-bay. Other releases of the Cars live, even on DVD, are of no comparison to this show (bands era)in sound, song line-up and presentation. This on DVD, if made available, would be a gem, no doubt, providing it would be properly remastered.",1103932800,3,796,4.534722222222222
7825510,5,6302388074,"The Cars invented a music niche (though they get lumped in as New Wavers). There was genius in what thay did. Original lyrics and tunes. Many layers to the sound they produced, and precision was their signature. This live performance evinces the talent of the quintet. Typical of great artists, they sound as good live as from the studio. This video sound qulity is quite good, even by today's standards. I wish it was twice as long, one hour is not enough. I experienced a Cars concert in the ""mosh pit"" in 1983 and this video was a wonderful way to relive a little of that. It's a little dated - this was not too long after ""The 70's"". An advantage is that you actually get to see extended footage of the band members playing, rather than 1/2 second snips jumping from one askew scene to another. This is probably my favorite concert video. If your a Cars fan, or an honest music fan . . . GOTTA HAVE IT!",1090627200,12,906,4.3352941176470585
