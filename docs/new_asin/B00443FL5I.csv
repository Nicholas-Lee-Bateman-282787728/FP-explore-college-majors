8415645,5,B00443FL5I,"This is a series that I stumbled upon on YouTube and have really found them to be both interesting and educational.  Each episode runs about 45 minutes so they are well worth the money if you have any interest in ships, especially ships that have very specialized duties.  I'd recommend this series to anyone.",1375056000,,309,4.703703703703703
8415646,5,B00443FL5I,"I haven't seen all of this DVD, but really liked the ones i watched, especially on the the ""QM2"" crossing. This a good documentry and I will order the second DVD.",1373155200,,162,4.258064516129032
8415647,5,B00443FL5I,"I originally purchased this just for the Queen Mary 2 episode, but was equally impressed with the other ships, especially Emma Maersk. The overall production quality and other features also added to the enjoyment.

P.S. The (assumedly) Canadian narrator was an interesting touch, too.",1372896000,,284,5.454545454545454

8415649,4,B00443FL5I,Well documented footage of several different types of ships with interesting missions.  They all seemed to have a schedule to meet which drove their very existence.  I enjoyed seeing the unique mechanical aspects of each of them. The other thing they all had in common was good food.,1361318400,,283,4.875
8415650,5,B00443FL5I,"I found the  "" Mighty ships: The most impressive ships"" video to be
just that, impressive. Not growing up around or near large bodies of
water I am amazed at the different types of ships designed to handle
their specific  type of cargo. This video covers in great detail all of the
aspects of operating and handling the cargo of these amazing vessels.
  I would recommend it for anyone interested in learning more about
the types of ships on the waterways today.",1351900800,,462,4.597560975609756
