(ex: ""now reach high to the sky off the thigh. . . blah, blah) It's distracting and annoying, as are his long-winded narrations, grating brooklyn accent, and numerous mentions about how he ""just made up this routine"" and it's something ""no one has seen before.""

I have to fast forward past his never-ending explanations, and then when you get to the actual yoga, he'll do maybe one or two sun salutions and that's it. It's a lot of work for a short workout. However, if you can look past all that stuff, and the fact it's only about 40 min. long, all in all it is a pretty good workout. I just skip all his nonsense and then replay the sun salutations until I feel like I got enough of a workout.",1104796800,13,777,4.25
1877840,5,B000093U0T,"While this video is a little more instructional than I like, and it seemed a little too easy to do, I woke up the next day and it hurt to walk!  2 days later I was almost back to normal.  This is a powerful workout, and I highly recommend it for intermediate/advanced users.  I heart Bryan Kest!",1087948800,17,295,4.140350877192983

7988953,4,B000093U0T,"I really liked this DVD.  The repetitive moves throughout are great for core strength and feeling like I'm getting an amazing stretch. I love it because it's not just a remix of his other DVD's. My biggest complaint is that I wish it were an hour long instead if 40 minutes.  Otherwise, I would definitely recommend:)",1417910400,,317,4.642857142857143
7988954,5,B000093U0T,"I have given this 5 stars because, like all of Bryan Kest's Power Yoga workouts this did not disappoint.  If you go to Bryan's web site you can download others or choose the live streaming but, unfortunately this only covers the US.  When I went to sign up for a membership login it was not possible to do it from the country where I live.",1370131200,2,339,4.2
7988955,5,B000093U0T,"I have had this DVD for 5 years and have used it so much it has worn out and I needed to buy a new one. It's the best yoga workout i have found and I have tried many. Most yoga DVD's I buy go in the bin after trying them once. This one isn't boring, is challenging but not so hard that it's off putting, and afterwards your whole body is vibrating with energy. By the way I would consider my fitness level pretty poor, but I have been doing yoga for years so know and understand the moves well enough to cope with this. This Would be too much for an absolute beginner.",1326412800,,568,3.9478260869565216
7988956,5,B000093U0T,"Bryan Kest's ""Power Yoga Series"" videos are awesome..even though they were the first in his series (late 90's I think)...they are great work out video's...challenge yourself to see if you can even get to the 3rd video workout in the series!!  All of the new and older workout video's by Bryan Kest are well done and I consider them to be the real thing..you build muscle and stamina and tone beautifully by moving your own weight around as well as increase your flexability immensly!!",1316563200,,484,4.761904761904762
7988957,1,B000093U0T,Today is August 12th and I haven't recieved my purchased yet.. I bought them a month ago. Please send me notice about them.,1313107200,,123,4.391304347826087
7988958,5,B000093U0T,I enjoy all of Bryan Kest's DVDs. This one in not an exeption. It's wonderful to have such a great workout at home!,1269734400,,115,4.043478260869565
7988959,5,B000093U0T,"I've had this video on VHS for years and pretty much wore it out. This DVD contains the same content, however the production technology of the main menu is a bit amaturistic, but still more convenient than the tape. Other than that, I find the ab workouts on this DVD very good and I appreciate the absence of the metaphisical mumbo-jumbo. Not to say he's got some good things to keep in mind while innitiating the workout.",1267660800,,423,4.5064935064935066
7988960,4,B000093U0T,Try YOGA.  This is a good YOGA DVD that keeps you challenged but encourages you to do things properly.  Be prepared for a good workout.,1257638400,,135,4.36
7988961,4,B000093U0T,Nice combo of yoga with arobic infulences.  Bryan does chat on a lot but he keeps you busy while he talks.  I enjoyed this and other DVD's that he has put out.,1238976000,,159,3.9375
