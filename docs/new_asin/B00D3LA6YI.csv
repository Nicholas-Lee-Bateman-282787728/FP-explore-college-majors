5772084,5,B00D3LA6YI,"Sofia The First: Ready To Be A Princess is a new Disney DVD compilation of episodes from the new Disney Junior original animated series inspried by the Disney Princesses. Princess Sofia is just learning to be a royal and always having new adventures with her step-siblings Amber and James, and her animal friends. And when she is in danger in one situation, she calls on Princess Jasmine(from the Aladdin series)to help Sofia out. The only special features was sneak peeks of other Disney DVD favourites like The Little Mermaid, Tinker Bell and The Pirate Fairy, and a teaser trailer for the upcoming new Disney animated feature film Frozen. Sofia The First: Ready To Be A Princess is just perfect for any Disney DVD collection and for fans of Sofia, Disney's littlest princess!",1379548800,,778,4.901515151515151
5772085,4,B00D3LA6YI,"My kids adore Sofia the First and this is something we actually agree on! I confess I mainly wanted to watch it because I love Tim Gunn but I was quickly drawn into this show right along with my kids. Sofia the First: Ready to be a Princess is a DVD with five of the original episodes.

We got off to a bit of a rough start with this DVD because for some reason my daughter didn't like the first episode ""A Royal Mess"" that was about the circus but as soon as we skipped that one and moved on, we had a little princess marathon.

Most little girls dream of becoming a princess. I admit I never wanted my daughter to think like this and have some fantasy about life. But childhood is all about dreams and fantasy and I like that Sofia has that dream of becoming a princess come true but she is still a good girl and it doesn't change who she is. It's actually a great life lesson for little girls.

This DVD comes with a bonus Sofia paper doll complete with wardrobe and outfit changes. Paige had that opened and Sofia through about three outfit changes before we got the first episode started. It's probably been her all time favorite bonus with a DVD and one she has already gotten hours of entertainment out of it. I love these fun little things that give them extra dreaming material.

Sofia the First: Ready to be a Princess is fun and magical and with a visit from Princess Jasmine on one episode, the royalty abounds!",1379462400,7,1423,4.278810408921933
5772086,5,B00D3LA6YI,"Disney princesses have been inspiring girls for a long time with their radiant beauty and grace.  Sofia has humble beginnings and is adopted into a royal family.  She wears a magical amulet that enables her to talk to animals.  While we can't relate to speaking with animals, we can understand Sofia's insecurities and we can learn many valuable lessons from her.  The Ready To Be A Princess collection has five episodes that teach lessons about lying, gossiping, keeping promises, kindness and overcoming your fears.  As a parent this is my favorite princess and my kids enjoyed the show as well.",1378944000,5,597,4.93
5772087,5,B00D3LA6YI,"In a kingdom where there is magic and fun, is Sofie, the new little princess making her debut.  After her mother marries a king, Sofie becomes a princess.  She goes by way of a flying carriage to the Royal Preparatory Academy, where Flora, Fauna and Merryweather (from Sleeping Beauty movie) teach her what she needs.  But Sofie has to break a sorcerer's spell and make friends with her new stepsister.  Maybe she can do this with kindness, help from her talking animal friends, and guidance from guest Cinderella.  This movie from Disney Jr channel has lots of songs, surprising characters.  I recommend this movie to any preschool girl training in sparkling inside and out.",1377043200,,675,4.87719298245614
5772088,5,B00D3LA6YI,"My girls (ages 3 and 6) love Sofia the First and we have every episode on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD. The show is great for its cute characters, wonderful songs and fun adventures. It always has a positive message and teaches kids valuable lessons in every episode.  My girls have been obsessed with the movie and all the shows, and really look forward to each new episode that airs.

This DVD contains five great episodes from the first season. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:
1. A Royal Mess - James breaks a stained glass window in the castle and Sofia covers for him so he can go to the Goldenwing Circus.
2. The Shy Princess - Sofia helps a shy classmate named Vivian and Clover makes a new Dragon friend (great song in this episode).
3. Blue Ribbon Bunny - Clover the rabbit shows off his talents.
4. The Princess Test - The princesses learn valuable lessons at Royal Prep Academy.
5. Two To Tangu - Sofia and Amber go on a magic carpet ride and get a special visit from Princess Jasmine.",1375056000,223,1110,4.357487922705314

5772095,3,B00D3LA6YI,"This is a review written by a normal adult who happens to have an almost-four year old daughter who loves Sofia. Is Sofia horrible? Not really--in fact, she is a pretty nice and humble princess. Is it harmful? Sometimes I wonder if the Disney princess thing is altogether harmless like we all pretend it is but, as far as princesses go, Sofia isn't half bad; she is a very nice girl. Is the whole premise of the whole story sort of idiotic? Yes, indeed.

The basic story here is that Sofia is just a girl living in a village as a peasant. Her mom works at a shoe store or something and the King comes in and falls in love with her and she ends up Queen. They move to the castle and Sofia ends up a princess. She inherits an entitled b%$#@ of a sister named Amber but she turns out to be not so bad really. Sofia works through the trials and tribulations of learning to become a princess with grace and humility.

So, basically, it is all a load of crap but I still let my daughter watch it. She still thinks that she too may end up a princess someday. I am thinking that she will someday understand that this won't really happen but hopefully she hasn't been damaged in the process. As far as princesses go, Sofia is not a bad role model but I still don't love the premise of the story at all.",1441756800,,1293,4.168

Yes they are episodes that have previously aired on television but it is nice to have them all on on DVD.  It is the perfect DVD whether my daughter wants to have a princess marathon or we just have time for one.  I love Sofia the First for my kids though, both my boys and daughter enjoy the show, because it is a wholesome show with great lessons.  From learning about responsibility to decision making to Being kind, there is a lesson for every child to learn from.

The episodes include:

1.  A Royal Mess
2. The Shy Princess
3. Blue Ribbon Bunny
4. The Princess Test
5. Two To Tangu

A special princess test where a teacher lures Sophia away from school alone into the woods and back to her cottage because she 'needs her help'??? And Sophia gets a special prize at the end for doing it??? For breaking every safety rule kids have? I hope this cartoon is never the cause of someone's child making an incredibly dangerous choice.
