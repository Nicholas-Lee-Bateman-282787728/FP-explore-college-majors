Their 85-86 team to me is GOAT especially recognized for the  team oriented for their passing .",1482019200,,262,4.553191489361702

Great recaps of the 86-87 season and playoff run and then the 85-86 season, playoff run and championship #16.",1376006400,,266,4.408163265306122
7887775,5,6305338825,"I've been following the Boston Celtics on and off since 1973 after I read a SCHOLASTIC SCOPE article about Dave Cowens while I was in junior high school.  But as much as I grew to love the Dave Cowens-John Havlicek-Paul Silas-Jo Jo White and Tommy Heinsohn as Coach era, the Larry Bird era was even better!
I've never seen a player--particularly a white player--that had to be guarded like Bird did!  Sometimes it looked like there were 3 or 4 guys guarding Bird at once, and he'd still score!
The ""Sweet Sixteen"" video is the best basketball video ever, but ""Home of the Brave isn't bad either.  But the 1986 Boston Celtics were the best Celtics team ever, while the Celtics team that went to the 1987 Finals against the Lakers and lost badly was just another losing finalist, with Bill Walton just a stumbling shadow of his former self after yet another foot injury.  But the 1986 Celtics team that won the championship was maybe the fourth best ever, and the Houston Rockets team they beat--with Hakeem Olajuwan and Ralph Sampson--might be in the top five all time, too.  The ""Sweet Sixteen"" video is very well written and well resesearched, especially in the way it shows that the series was much tougher than most people know--the Rockets seemed unbeatable in the first part of Game One--and particularly in the way it highlights the 1986 SIXTH MAN OF THE YEAR Bill Walton!  Without Walton, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO 16TH NBA CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE CELTICS!!!  There are also excellent shots of Ralph Sampson which will be an eye opener for anyone who thought he couldn't play.  RALPH SAMPSON IS ONE OF THE 5 BEST CENTERS EVER TO PLAY THE GAME!!!  But Larry Bird knew how to deal with Ralph Sampson, or rather--how to let the Boston fans deal with Ralph!--and after the now legendary Game 5--featuring the fight between the 7'4 Sampson and 6'1 Celtics backup guard Jerry Sichting!--Larry Legend announced to the press that ""Sampson had better wear a hard hat...our fans will take care of him!""  And they did!
  I will never forget the Larry Bird era in Boston!!!--
IT WAS GREAT WHILE IT LASTED!!!

THe Celtics had Mchale,Parrish&Larry Legend Bird.they Lost to My Lakers in 87 but Beat the Rockets in 86.it's a Cool Overview of both Finals.this is when basketball was Basketball.when there was a Team Concept&You truly Rooted Hard Versus another team.",1020038400,3,496,4.77906976744186
7887777,5,6305338825,"A fantastic tape with both the 1985-86 season review, including the Championship victory over the Houston Rockets, and the 1986-87 season review, finishing in a 4-2 series loss to the Lakers. This is great value and a great tape. Great basketball, great players, great footage. The 1985-86 Celtics must surely be hailed as one of the greatest teams of all time. So much depth and talent which no team could handle during the 85-86 season.
The tape follows the Celtics, firstly through the 86-87 season, where injuries and fatigue took its toll. It is great to see an NBA Finals review from the losing team's perspective (as opposed to the Lakers - Drive for Five tape). The tape then moves onto the previous years Championship over Houston. Again, great footage and interviews, and a seemingly unlimited supply of awesome basketball skills.
Overall a great tape for any basketball fan, EVEN if you're a Laker.",976579200,12,909,4.909090909090909
