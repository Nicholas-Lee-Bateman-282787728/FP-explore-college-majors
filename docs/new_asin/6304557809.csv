897515,4,6304557809,"Anyone who is a Jet Li fan will indeed appreciate the kung-fu sequences in this movie... especially the last one where Li makes his own deadly amalgamation of the Drunken Fist and Shaolin five Fist styles... the result  is a superb ending fight!  The story is long and irrelevant at parts, but  comprehensible.  Here's some insight... anything Yuen Woo Ping (renowned  director and martial  arts choreographer) touches is a classic... Wu Tang  Master, Fist Of Legend, Drunken Master... need I say more!  Also, the  chicken/centipede dance was ridiculous yet amusing.... Purchase!",928886400,,579,5.274725274725275
897516,2,6304557809,"I love some of Jet Li's work (esp. in LW4), but this movie was just terrible.  Way too much wire-fu, the plot was unintelligible and it seemed like the whole film was in fast forward.  The only saving grace was the  horrible job of translating on the subtitles.  Example: when one character  means to say ""I have to go the bathroom"" he instead says ""I  want pissing.""  Without that it wouldn't have been funny at all.",928108800,,417,4.407894736842105
897737,4,6304557809,"This movie is perhaps one of the zaniest kung fu movies I've seen. There's men in drag, Cartoony fight scenes, and of course, Jet Li dressed up as a chicken fighting a giant centepede.
One of the good things about this movie, is that the fight scenes are very original. There aren't any ones with two guys standing in an open area facing off in a cliche fight scene.  There's a fight scene where Jet Li never gets out of the chair he's sitting in. There's also one where he's holding onto a bouquet of flowers and one  handedly defeats three goons. The best fight scene is the final show down between Jet li and Gorden Liu. Jet Li performs an amazing Drunken Boxing technique which is far better than Jackie Chan's in Drunken Master.

Another good thin about this movie is that allthough they use excessive wire stunts, many of them are still  beleivable and actually contribute to the fight scenes. The end fight scene, where Li comically bounces off walls and lands on ropes must have used wires, but doesn't look fake at all. There are however some scenes where the special effects are horrible and unnessessary. For example there is a fight scene where Jet Li lifts his leg and kicks someone behind him in the face, and they use a fake leg that looks like it should be attached to a muppet.
Another Problem with this movie is the plot and subtitles. The plot has something to do with the opium wars, Wong Fei Hung trying to start a new school, and women being stolen and sold as prostitutes, but that's the best I can do to summarize the plot.  What makes the plot so hard to follow is partially the fact that there's a plot turn every ten minutes. However the biggest problem is the sub titles. Many Hong Kong movies have a tendency to have subtitles which are in white and are displayed over the movie  instead of underneath it or in a box. This makes it impossible to read half of the subtitles because they are in white writing over a white picture such as most of the characters' shirts.
This movie is pretty good. It has very creative and impressive fight scenes. However there are some shortcomings in the special effects and storyline.",1010102400,,2147,4.478260869565218
897738,5,6304557809,"This film is what I beleive to be the greatest Once Upon a Time in China entry by far.  Matched only by top films such as Iron Monkey and Twin Warriors, this one is a must see for martial arts fans.  The scene where Jet Li is dressed as a rooster is actually really cool and it leads to a wicked end battle which stands as one of the greatest fight sequences in cinematic history.  If you're a kung fu enthusiast, buy this film immediatley you will not regret it.",1006560000,,463,4.122222222222222
897739,1,6304557809,"When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting ""customers""(read victims).",1004572800,21,850,4.31875
897740,3,6304557809,"Originally titled ""The Last Hero in Chine."" A nice twist on the Wong Fei Hong storyline, with Master Wong moving his martial arts studio, unbeknownst to him, next to a brothel. The righteous master can't have that, but it turns out the brothel helps him defeat the baddies. A ridiculous display of Jet Li fighting in a chicken outfit is quickly made up for with a brilliant display of drunken boxing. Jet Li is his usual charismatic self, and Yuen Woo Ping can be counted on to deliver every time...",998784000,,499,4.555555555555555
897741,4,6304557809,"Whats up folks?  I picked this movie up about 2 months ago.  I didn't know what i was getting into, but i imagined that it couldn't be too bad, I mean, the main character is Wong Fei Hung.  Right off of the bat, i want to say that Amazon has the best price ive seen for this movie.  So if you're gonna get it, and i recommend that you do, i urge you to get it from here.
Whats the premise?  The cops arrest 3 leaders of the rebel Boxer Association, you may remember the Boxer Association from your history classes.  Well, Fei Hung happens to be there, and hands them over to the police.  Fei Hung is running out of money, cant afford his studio, so his star pupils Ah-so and Ah-fu make a deal with some landlord for leasing a building for dirt cheap, they later find out that the owner of the building is a pimp, and his whore house is right next door, overlooking the grounds of the studio.  I want tell you anything else, and theres a lot more to see, but ill tell you that its funny.  The martial arts is pretty good, and if you guys are MA fans, then I should tell you that Gordon ""Master Killer"" Liu is in this also.  Yeah, thats right, the log on water riding master himself.
So if you guys are looking for a good laugh (at the comedy, not poor attempt at a movie) then this movie is definitely it.  It has its serious moments too, after all its about Fei Hung.  It has good MA action, from what I remember, i mean i watched it twice.  The characters are cool, but the cast that plays them is excellent.  The villain, is awesome.  He's evil as hell!  Certifiably insane!
I don't know what else to say about it, its a really good movie, i thought it was better than Once Upon A Time in China 2, (not OUATIC I, i said II).  The whores were funny.  I only wish they showed more of Leung Man, she was bad boy.  She had this one scene, man, shes good (by the way, shes not one of the whores)
4 stars, go get it.  If you're into Jet Li, or are wandering if you really like his style of acting and MA, then get this movie, he'll impress you, he is afterall a Kung Fu master.",994291200,8,2073,4.034313725490196
897742,2,6304557809,"I bought this film on a whim, since the store I went to didn't have 'exactly' what I wanted (OUATIC 2 fer sure)SO I figured I'd watch the last in the series since OUATIC and America was a HUGE disappointment for me. I have yet to make up my mind on Jet Li films. And this put me in the negative state (again) The story was slow and unmoving, the characters were not interesting, the fighting was sparse (why else get a kung fu film?)and the last fight with Jet in a chicken suit (JET LI IN A CHICKEN SUIT!!!!!)was the last straw. I'm sorry, but if Fist Of Legend was his best, then this must have been by far his worst. ""I wouldn't buy this DVD with YOUR money!!!""",992822400,5,664,4.115384615384615
897743,5,6304557809,"I agree with Michael Van about the clipped version "" Deadly China Hero"" as I own ""Last Hero in China"" which is the movie in its orginal presentation and with Subtitles.  This is actually, if placed in order of sequences by year, the Fourth ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series before OUATIC IV/V came out.  Nonetheless, you have to watch this movie as it has, as usual, great martial art scenes. I own all but OUATIC IV and most of Jet Li's DVD's that are available. The 6th version of OUATIC is ""Once upon a Time in China and America"" also starring Jet Li. Though this may be the 4th Jet Li did as Wong Fei-Hung, you do not have to see the three previous OUATIC's. Order is not important with this version of Wong Fei-Hung but the tales of this Martial Artist (a real actual Chinese Hero) is.  Get this DVD and try to get ""Last Hero in China"" also.  In fact, get every Jet Li movie made. You will not be dissappointed.  This man is our replacement for Bruce Lee.",989884800,11,961,4.229508196721311
897744,5,6304557809,"This movie is very cool. I rented it and now I went out and bought it.  It's an amazing movie, the story is interesting, but the fighting scenes are really incredible. During the movie, a fight breaks out nearly every 2 minutes and what really got me was the unique fighting style. The quality of the film is mediocre, but what can you expect from a film made in 1978. I think 16 dollars is a little pricey for a movie that is this old and with nearly no quality improvements on DVD. But overall I highly recommend this movie to any Kung Fu enthusiast; it's one of the best Jackie Chan classics.",988848000,15,595,4.265486725663717
897745,1,6304557809,"The other user comments are technically correct. The film is great... in its original version. ""Deadly China Hero,"" however, is a clipped version of the film ""Last Hero of China."" I highly recommend the original film instead of this one, which cuts out several crucial scenes and important subplots. There's no reason to settle for this hacked-up version.",982022400,29,355,5.137931034482759
897746,5,6304557809,"JET li stars in this powerful movie as he portrays chinese folk hero WONG FEI HUNG. THis movie is totally different from the other movies in the Once upon a time in china series. Some of the most memorable scenes from the movie are when Li battles ""shaolin masta killa"" Gordon Lui. The other great part in this movie is when Li dresses up like a chicken and battles a giant centipede. The end is still the best part when Li breaks his toes he's forced to get drunk and uses the Drunken style to win the final battle. One of Li's finest!!!!!!!!!!",976752000,16,545,4.300970873786408

897845,4,6304557809,"Once again Jet Li reprises his roll of Wong Fei Hung (Once upon a time in  china a.k.a. OUTIC series) much to our treat. I'm not quite sure where the  time line is in this movie as far as OUTIC is concerned, however I beleive  this is one of Jet's most underated movies. The cinemetography in this  movie is splendor, as well as the dynamic camera angles the director chose  to use (ie. they bring out a prisoner and he fall's to his knee's using an  up shot for dramatic's). There is plenty of wire work in this if your a fan  of it, which you must be if you like Jet Li. The whole parade thing they  get going on may be a bit corn ball, but hang in there because Jet does a  drunken style that rival's that of Jackie...well you get the idea. If you  don't have it, you can't go wrong with popin down a 10 spot for this  one....it's a steal. If your a OUTIC fan you must get this film and Iron  Monkey wich is directed by Woo Ping to truely complete your collection. Jet  Li is the one, he's finally here folks, the wait is over.

ONE OF THE MOST SURPISNIG ASPECTS was the amazingly choreographed  fight seens with the lion dances,if they bored you in once upon a time in  china 3 they definitley won't here. I particularly liked the bad guys  sporting a large centipede suit with razor sharp arms,the final fight seen  was also one of the best that I have seen.

7873969,5,6304557809,"I received this version with the same cover art and I have no complaints.... the DVD looks professionally printed and is definitely not a boot legged copy. The video quality is slightly grainy, too, and there is no dubbed English- which may not be a bad thing. It is sub-titled in English, though. Also, I rented this movie years ago so I was familiar with the film and personally, I like it. Would I suggest it? Yes, especially if you're a Jet Li fan. Would i suggest it anyway? Of course I would!

I'm not too picky with the quality as are other reviewers, though they make good points and their critiques are valid.... I'm just glad to have this in my collection... I'll break it out every few months and I always get a ""kick"" from Li's films, so I'm satisfied and you probably will be too, unless you're an ultra snob in regard to precision quality recording and strange English verse.

7873972,4,6304557809,"Not widely regarded as an extension of the ""Once Upon A Time In China"" series, ""Last Hero In China"" tends to go unmentioned as far as guilty-pleasure entertainments go.  I believe that the film's quality (though the Wong Jing humor is debatable) is right on par with the series, as once again Jet Li braids his hair to assume the identity of Wong Fei-Hung and rip some naughty miscreants a new one.  Yes, Jet Li is in the role NOT Jackie Chan, as Amazon's blurb mistakenly implies.  Though both actors have personified the role, it is in this film's final fight that I finally got to see Jet Li's bout at Drunken Boxing for my first time ever (thus the review's title).  If he does it in older movies, I haven't seen it yet.  But he demonstrates the stance with all the effortless acrobatic ability his legions of fans have grown accustomed to.  Plus, Yuen ""you only wish you could choreograph action like me"" Woo-Ping offers us a shot at Fei-Hung delving into Chicken Style against a ten-man centipede, plus numerous other wire-fu goodies that'll put a stoned grin onto any viewers face.
No real special features on the disc to even mention save the inherent but ever-necessary widescreen, but then again I own the HK version.  The only drawback...?  Where's Auntie 13 (Rosamund Kwan)?  She writes Fei-Hung a letter in the movie, but that's all we get.  Sigh...  But enjoy -- this is as ridiculously fun a movie as you could want from Sir Jet.",1087948800,15,1444,4.6015625

7873974,3,6304557809,"For those buying this Deadly China Hero dvd, you are getting a [junky] version of the original film Last Hero In China. The distributors for Deadly.. are known for bootleggin movies and cutting scenes out, so look for the right one if you intend to check this film out. This film is the Jet's second to the last installment to the Once Upon A Time In China (OUATIC) series. It's nothing spectacular in my opinion, but it's not a bad film either. Tsui Hark, who did the original OUATIC series is not a part of this film; instead, the dirty Wong Jing directed this film, which kind of hurt it a bit. Yuen Woo Ping still provided the choreography, but I've seen better. Wong's aunt, or love interest, (Rosamund Kwan) is also out of this picture. Jet plays Wong Fei Hung once again, and he moves his school temporarily to a new location. The school ends up next to a brothel, Fei Hung soons discovers corruption and kidnappings of women taking place around the town. Officials want to get rid of him, and of course Wong wants to save everybody as usual. This is probably all you'd need to know about the story because it really is not that interesting. Right from the start, I could not take this film seriously at all. It was trying pretty hard to be funny, and sometimes it worked, other times it failed miserably. It felt like watching a parody of OUATIC. The MA were good, but not great; there was simply too much wirework and fake elements involved. It's one thing if the movements look real, but wirework was pretty bad in this film. There's a scene where a bad official slaps his hands on tiles, and this brings them up flying at Wong; all of a sudden the official decides to literally swim or glide across the ground afterwards...couldn't help thinkin what was the point of it was, but anyways. The bad official (Alan Chui?) also has one of the most annoying laughs you'll ever hear. There were bits and pieces of battles that stood out, but not one ENTIRE fight scene impressed me.  The Shaolin Master Killer Gordon Liu(Lau Kar Fai) was also in the film as a bad guy, but director Wong Jing clearly wasted Liu's talents by not using them. In addition, the outcome of his final battle is pretty pathetic. There is a fight between Liu and Jet that starts off decent until the flying elements came into play...sigh...like I said, bits and pieces. Cheung Man is also in the film, but her MA is strictly wire based and made her look like a ballerina...nothing impressive. As everyone already mentioned here, the last battle involves Jet in a chicken suit fighting a group of baddies dressed as a centipede. It's kind of silly, but the battle that follows between Fei Hung and the bad official is nice. There is still wirework done here, but this battle probably had the most REAL and serious MA. Sadly, there were many shots that made me realize that Jet was doubled for many of the sequences...sigh...you'll also see Jet try to use the drunken style, though unconvincing, and some great moves came afterwards and probably is the base of my rating. Some of the moves here are pretty brutal, and they stayed in my mind even after the film. Overall, I would call this an average movie. OUATIC 1-3 totally outshines this film because there was more meaning to it and I felt more for the characters, plus the MA was far better. I can't really recommend you to buy this film, but since it is pretty cheap, why not. Besides, it's part of Jet's Wong Fei Hung history. It's definitely worth checking out, so you can make your own opinions. To me, this film is trying too hard to be funny, and sadly I found myself laughing at scenes in the film that probably weren't intended to be funny. Better Jet films are his original OUATIC 1-3, Fist of Legend (his best), Swordsman II, Tai Chi Master, Kung Fu Colt Master, Shaolin Temple, and more...hope this was helpful, check out my other MA reviews, thanks for reading.",1041984000,4,3905,4.531161473087819

They even have one of my all time favorites Gordon Lui(he's a bad guy this time though) i recommend this version on dvd for two reasons first it's Jet Li, so you know you're getting great fight scenes, (even though his drunken boxing wasn't as good as when Jackie Chan played Wong Fei Hong in Drunken Master 2) and secondly because the Deadly China Hero dvd is the worst dvd i have in my collection, it's worst than anything i have on my vhs collection as well.

This film is, as the title of this article proclaims, an interesting combination. Combination of what, you ask? It is a combination of the Historic Chinese Martial Arts extravaganza and a Tom Green movie. What makes the film interesting is that the combination is not as bad as it sounds. Jet Li once agains plays the role of Wong Fei Hung, as he did in the Once Upon A Time in China historical epics, but this Fei Hung is a very different character from the more serious Fei Hung (particularly in the first OUATIC) we are used to.
  In essence this film takes the fairly standard school versus school and style versus style conflict and extends it to a Dragon dancing competition (mirrors of OUATIC here, but wait) with Jet Li's masterful Dragon dancing interrupted by a villain in a Millipede suit. Jet Li loses the initial competition, due to various circumstances which include the villain's nepharious influence. Jet Li recovers and battles the Millipede in a Chicken Suit in the final battle. Chicken suit? Yes, a chicken suit. I told you there was a touch of Tom Green in this movie, or is it Adam Sandler? Doesn't matter.
  Typical of the Jet Li/Wong Jing pairing films this is a less than serious affair. If you go in expecting wonderful wuxia wire-fu and a few laughs in a no budget free for all you will have a great time. Jet Li is an amazing martial artist and somehow this film works.
