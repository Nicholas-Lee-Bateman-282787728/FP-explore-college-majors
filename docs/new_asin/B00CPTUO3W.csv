While on a year long mission in a space station on the moon Col. Gerard Brauchman (Slater) and his crew experience a meteor storm. While trying to radio for help the communication system is knocked out and the four astronauts are left on their own. While trying to figure out what to do they begin to notice strange things happening to each other. This is a movie that I had pretty low expectations for but it was even a little worse then I expected. Bad acting, pretty slow and boring. The one thing I will say about this is that the movie tried so hard to be Aliens but it just never quite made it. There have been some very good sci-fi surprises in the last few years. Movies like Splice and Moon come to mind. This one is not anywhere near those two. Overall, if you are a huge sci-fi fan then you may like this. I did not.

5733271,1,B00CPTUO3W,I am an easy movie reviewer. I enjoy a lot of straight to video films that a lot of other people rag on. This movie however could be a science 3000 film. Running around like chickens with their heads cut off & leaving doors open like it is some kind of spring day in Florida. Felt sorry for the actors. The director should have been shot. The acting itself was tolerable & F/X watchable. Everything else just plain sucked.,1447286400,2,422,4.3544303797468356
5733272,1,B00CPTUO3W,"From the beloved director who brought you such classics as Battlefield Earth comes a movie a lot like Alien, except, you know, without anything truly good about it.

By a technical standpoint this movie isn't as horrendous as Battlefield, but it is just as, if not more insulting. Roger Christian is a man I respect for his ambition, he was an art director for both Alien and the original Star Wars movies, he is to be admired. As bad as Battlefield Earth may be, I blame that on Scientology more than anything else, Christian at least put in some effort into that movie, unlike other disgracefully horrible movies. This, however, is a shameless ripoff of alien, and it's painfully obvious. I can't give this movie any real credibility, it's bad, don't waste your time. It's not even as entreatingly horrible as Battlefield Earth, it's just kind of cringe worthy. It's not as bad as Gigli or Garbage Pail Kids, but it's more than likely not worth your time.",1447200000,2,957,4.696428571428571

5733275,5,B00CPTUO3W,"Now this one I liked something going at a hundred miles per hour with meteors with that they must endure alien spores attached to the meteors and with the facility falling apart and a sneaky little varmint running around killing the crew one by one and on top of this you have life support failing what else can go wrong. That is all the hints I'm given as there is more to the plot and that remains for you to discover, why spoil a grand show like this that has you sitting on your nerves looking in all directions for the thing. I rated this an A grade for the ideas that run around all over the place in this little spacecraft. Watchable and entertaining so what are you waiting for get a move on, as the curtains going up and  where's the munchies, got your feet up relaxing, comfy, good let the show begin with this fabulous movie that will have you in a trance for the rest of the night.

5733301,1,B00CPTUO3W,"Christian Slater is among my favorite actors. He tried, but the rest of  the actors, and the weak typical alien monster in space story with a limited budget staging did not help.
  They could have escaped but chose to remain in the failing station for some unexplained illogical reason.  If an airplane with a pin hold could suck anyone out of a plain why did all these 3' holes only make hissing noice. and where did all these ""last remaining"" oxygen supplies come from"" but of course when the rescue craft arrives they finally ran out and had to hold their breath to be saved
 The woman in this movie condemned them all to die and had no moral campus and chose to infect them all. The almost good guy was a booze drinking scientist, which the alien cloned himself to look like because  he looked strong.  Also, with a leader that could not make up his mind about locking up the disease spreading Ava Cameron or letting her die was equally unsupported and illogical. They all fought to save her and let her be one to protect and help her escape was really dumb.
  The ending, if you could call it that, left us wondering if the one remaining male (Slater) and ""disease lady"" managed to hold their breath for 3.5 minutes to get to the rescue craft over coming decompression.
  Our only clue, that could go either way, showed only their final ""cell phone"" video warning about the DANGER TO ALL HUMAN LIFE ON EARTH DNA monster. Also, the BIG FINISH had the alien peaking out of a building and lurking after the escape pod made it to earth piloted by the alien.  I guess this was to make us worry. Did they find the alien and kill him? Who cares the movie was to dumb to figure out what to do with the alien, the woman waiting for a court marshal, the disease she may still be charring and our hero Slater. .",1411603200,3,1805,4.339285714285714

standard scifi tropes ie. isolation, cabin fever, distrust, alien parasite, infection, 1 hot chick with multiple guys, paranoia and uncertainty.
The movements of the plot could not have been more clearly telegraphed.
The actors are ok but have a boring, functional and expository script to work with.
All in all, a wasted effort. The same things have been done better before, with more style and substance.
'Prometheus' and it's predecessors (Alien, Aliens) explored the same ideas (alien infection/pregnancy, rapidly accelerated growth, blowing it out the airlock, escaping in an escape pod) in a more interesting and profound ways.
Why someone bothered to poorly replicate this is beyond my understanding.
The ending made no sense (hold breath for 3.5 minutes while running... okay) but was predictable as hell. Really? The parasite's on earth now? What a damn surprise.

I don't like the direction Mr. SLater has been heading the past few years or more, one stinker after another.

5733309,1,B00CPTUO3W,"""Alien"" was made in the year 1979. At what point are bad sci-fi movies going to stop blatantly copying it?

""Stranded"" may be one of the most offensive examples,  because director Roger Christian actually worked as an art director on ""Alien."" Its naked lack of originality isn't what kills it, though -- that would be the the ugly cheapness of the entire production, with flat, obnoxiously dumb characters and a doltish script that molests logic and leaves it weeping in the tub.

It takes place on a mining station (take a drink every time it rips off ""Alien"") on the moon, which is partially disabled by a meteor storm. Already we have a problem, since there's very little on the moon that people might want to mine.

Astronaut Ava Cameron (Amy Matysio) investigates the damage, and comes across a meteor with pollen inside... I mean, mysterious alien spores. She is accidentally infected with the spores, despite the best efforts of regulations-obsessed Colonel Brauchman (Christian Slater). A few hours later, she wakes up heavily pregnant, although the idiot Dr. Krauss (Brendan Fehr) is convinced that she spontaneously developed a baby-sized uterine cyst.

He's wrong, of course -- it's an alien baby. While the doctor keeps insisting that there is totally not a monster baby running loose, it morphs into an adult duplicate of a crew member, and begins prowling on the station. With air running out (this station is built like a moldy cardboard box), the crew must kill the creature before it kills them.

If the name Roger Christian sounds familiar, it's because he directed one of the worst blockbuster movies ever, ""Battlefield Earth."" Sadly he hasn't gotten any better in the past fifteen years, because ""Stranded"" is an absolute mess -- just about everything wrong with a horror and/or sci-fi story happens here, from insufferably stupid characters to giant plot holes.

The biggest problem lies with the script, which frequently forgets important plot points (the escape pod, which NOBODY thinks of until near the end) and employs bafflingly awful science (farewell, law of the conservation of mass/energy). The doctor is quite possibly the stupidest character I have ever seen in a movie, which is saying something -- the guy resolutely refuses to believe that a woman infected with mysterious, tissue-generating alien matter could possibly have something foreign inside her.

It all takes place on one of the cheapest extraterrestrial stations I have ever seen in a movie. It looks like they glued some plastic panels to the walls of an old factory, with a few iPads as consoles. And it's SO poorly designed that not only do the lights AND air supply conk out, but the airlocks are designed to blow out anyone who gets trapped inside, with NO way of overriding them. This lunar station is so awful that it seems like something the government designed and funded.

To cover up the cheap sets, Christian chooses to film everything in the dark. EVERYTHING. The characters spend the whole movie lurching around in the dark, which makes it pretty hard to see what's happening. And Christian's directing style is painfully abrupt and clunky, with ""scary"" moments that just end up being vaguely funny (such as the breastfeeding scene).

Oh, and the alien is a total disappointment as well. We don't ever get a clue what its motivation or goals are, and since this movie's budget was found under the sofa cushions, it's played by one of the human cast... naked and covered in KY jelly.

And yes, it rips off ""Alien"" countless times, from the lackluster reproductive horror to the mining facility to the oh-so-clever airlock scene. And Brauchman is basically a genderflip Ripley, minus the feminism. Somehow this comes across as being even worse than most ""Alien"" ripoffs, since the director actually worked on that movie.

With all those negatives, it seems almost pointless to criticize the actors and characters. Well, they suck. The actors give apathetic performances, possibly because they are playing incredibly thin, hollow characters. We know nothing about them, their lives or their feelings at the end. I thought Ava was in a romance with one of the other crew, but then she has a moment with the doctor so... I don't know.

""Stranded"" makes you want to quietly beat yourself into unconsciousness, just so you won't have to watch more of it than necessary. If you want to torture a sci-fi or horror fan, just put this on.",1391126400,4,4438,4.948924731182796
5733332,2,B00CPTUO3W,"Unlike some that get paid to review movies, I just like to watch and enjoy them. And if you ask I will tell you if they were any good. I usually like Christian Slater but in this movie, he was below his ability. How can you have a woman that was pregnant and then she's not pregnant and  no one asked ""What happened to the baby?"". I think I heard her say, we are not alone here. It's funny no one would believe her. I think $3.99 was too much for what I got.",1390953600,,458,3.872340425531915

5733335,2,B00CPTUO3W,"The storyline is flimsy.  The acting is just bad.  Even Christian Slater gave a poor performance.  I love B rated movies, but this was beyond that.  Something that was thrown together to fit a cookie cutter sci-fi film would be better than this because there are too many times I said to myself, ""Wait what?""  Not entertaining, not educational, not thrilling, Not seeing ever again.",1389657600,2,382,4.815384615384615

5733337,1,B00CPTUO3W,"People today forget just how groundbreaking and how scary the original ""Alien"" was, when it was released in 1979.  It was a giant blockbuster, and it spawned dozens if not hundreds of slavish copies.  The video stores of yore were chock to the rafters in homegrown direct-to-video copies made for change the producer shook out of his couch, as well as Italian knockoffs aplenty.  Many of these had the word ""Alien"" somewhere in the title so you knew what you were getting.  But not this one.

Let's see - a small group of blue collar workers are alone in space in a dimly lit facility.  Check.  Something happens to introduce an alien egg/spore/thing into their environment?  Check.  Somebody gets infected and an alien jumps out of their body?  Check.  The alien grows and changes its form?  Check.  The alien hides in and travels through the air ducts?  Check.  The alien hides in the escape pod they have to use to escape the dying space facility?  Check.  This thing shamelessly hits every single beat of ""Alien"".  In a way I respect the sheer chutzpah of this movie.  In a more important way, every time I see a scene from ""Alien"" repeated in ""Stranded,"" that scene just reminds me of that much better movie.

The actors gamely and professionally run through the awful script to the best of their ability.  But the script is hopelessly confused about everything, including how humans and gases behave.  In some scenes our characters are military folks and one faces a court martial for violating orders.  In other scenes Slater tells them not to violate ""company guidelines.""  So are these people employees or soldiers or what?  The moon base is chock full of more carbon monoxide than you can imagine and it takes several high pressure thingamabobs to ""cleanse"" it.  But why on the moon is their pressurized living area open to all this carbon monoxide?  And how on the moon can they _open an airlock_ to purge just the carbon monoxide, while still keeping all the oxygen in???  How come the one guy explodes on instant contact with vacuum but the other guys can _run on the lunar surface_ without spacesuits for minutes and not die?  How come they don't understand that ""quarantine"" doesn't mean ""going into the room with the one infected person over and over and over again and touching that person a lot""?

Some of it is entertaining in its badness, but overall it is just tedious and borderline unwatchable.  If you want a bad movie that's funny, look elsewhere.  If you want a good movie, look elsewhere as well.",1388966400,,2523,4.702517162471396

I also would have strongly suggested these people have called a favor or two in and had some of the top masters of horror proofread this script before it started filming!
SyFy movies are way better...this was a hour and a half of ""why"". If I had paid more than $7 for this...I'd a been awe fully pissed with myself.

As I did not notice the monster eating the astronauts, I am not quite sure what was meant by: stopping the creature from reaching Earth for more of its food supply. In addition, I am wondering if there will be a sequel involving a search for, and possible destruction of the alien. Perhaps a sequel would be even better than the initial flick. One of my biggest gripes is the lack of discipline of the astronauts in dealing with protecting themselves and, the Earth from contagion, especially since they were military astronauts; and because one of the major goals of our space program is to prevent contagion in our exploration to, and return from space.

It's meant to be something of a thriller but my wife and I laughed all the way through. From the cheesy repetitive set designs to the boring dialogue. It didn't appear to us that these actors were even committed to this thing. Like they were repeating a script but they had the glassy eyed appearance of people  who's minds were elsewhere. You could actually see the wheels turning. What am I going to do today after the shoot? Am I ever going to be offered a real acting job after this little number? There were parts of this move where the people acting were supposed to be in isolation. Yet there was more traffic in that room than there is at the jiffy lube around the corner. These people were pretending to be so upset about forced isolation but why? Everybody on board was in that room. The rest of the station was empty. On second thought maybe you should see it. It's unintentionally hilarious.,1380672000,,1021,4.489247311827957
5733374,3,B00CPTUO3W,not aliens but not half as bad as some of the reviews much worse sci fi out there.  Not Event Horizon but entertaining,1380240000,,118,4.130434782608695
5733375,1,B00CPTUO3W,"I was very interested in this movie when I picked it up. I like Christian Slater, and although the back of the box gave me a story that I've seen dozens of times, I figured like those dozens of other movies imitating Alien or The Thing, it would spice things up with some small thing I hadn't seen before. Oh, and once I loaded it up even the disk menu looked cool to me. Got super pumped for this flick.

And it gets off to a very awkward start. It attempts an in media res of our 4 main characters packing up to go home in the midst of a media shower. These types of movie hinge on caring about who's on screen and we're denied that. I barely caught their names the whole way through.

Although, perhaps this in media res idea wasn't so bad because it turns out the movie is fatally boring, so that would have been another 20 minutes on a runtime that's already desperately too long for the material on screen. Maybe a good 45 minute episode of a horror anthology tv show would have suited this better. There are long stretches of either not much at all seeming to happen, or something not too exciting happening that, because I've been zoning in and out, I don't understand why it is happening.

The creature (before it shape shifted) looked fine, though. Too bad it wasn't ever scary, which is the next problem. At least most of these clones deliver a scare or too, or maybe just a few hairs raised. Nothing. Flatlined the whole way through.

It did have a decent idea in spores being transported on the meteor, and with a larger cast (especially large enough to create mystery over who is and is not an evil human killing space demon -- in Stranded the mystery is never even attempted) we might have had a cool The Thing clone in space that could have been really scary and really gruesome. Instead we have a guy with black contacts in his eyes harassing just 3 folks you don't care anything about.",1379894400,,1903,4.337078651685394
5733376,1,B00CPTUO3W,"Not even a fair movie period. Too derivative: it's like a C-grade ""Alien"" (with humble apologies to Ridley Scott) was cross-bred with every bad sci-fi movie ever made, and the resulting B-movie ""Stranded"" concoction that hits the screen is as you'd expect - a D-/F+ grade pseudo-Alien ripoff. This was just sorry movie making. The whole thing was unbelievably trite and low budget. As a rule, I enjoy sci-fi movies, but I could not wait until this one was over. Not recommended for anyone with an IQ of over 70. Movies like this make one really appreciate 1979's Alien as a fantastic and imaginative masterpiece, this ""Stranded"" dreck just pales in comparison. It's not even amusingly bad, it's just bad period.",1379635200,,711,4.884297520661157

5733378,2,B00CPTUO3W,"I saw this title here on amazon and should have read the reviews first... luv SciFi...But purchased it on a whim at walmart.(sorry amazon). Christian Slater is one of my favorite action actors and by looking at the DVD box art I thought I would have good intriguing evening, so spark up the pop-corn and get ready. NOT. Dont want to spoil it so vague details I will share and make it short. The Meteor shower coming down in the opening scenes couldn't stop laughing it was the special effects that were like early 60's Japanese era ala Godzilla fame... and the device comunicators used to talk with earth were like the clip on book lamps you find at dollar stores... laughter aside the storyline was rather good. Never buy a movie based on Box art. ughhhh.",1379462400,,756,4.525547445255475
5733379,1,B00CPTUO3W,The video was bad and the movie sucks i didn't like it because the movie doesnt look like space movie from the beginning to the end is not make any sense an in the top of that the video look bad and i have faster internet so it suppost to be clean a clear image so i am very upset and if i have the chance to ask for a refund i will more than happy have a good day,1378857600,,364,3.5625
5733380,1,B00CPTUO3W,"Firstly, I pride myself as a B movie connoisseur. I'm a huge fan of the genre.  I could spend days watch films that most people wouldn't make 20 minutes through. To give you a good idea I'm a huge fan of a lot of Rodger Corman's pictures.

That all being said ""Stranded"" was a movie I could barely sit through. I found myself 20 minutes in checking my e-mail and messing around on my phone. This movie is incredibly flat. There zero character development the plot has been done a million times before and by better low budget, underground film makers.

Even the alien monster is so badly done. I would have been fine with a over the top latex, rubber suit with typical monstrous features, but no not even that was there. It was pure laziness. Also the whole film takes place in the dark, so every scene is a dull gray, zero variation on shadow and light.

I'm just not sure what the point of this film was. It wasn't one of those its so bad it's good films. It was one of those films that in my opinion has no redeeming qualities.

Oh, has Christian Slater fallen from grace. It's sad to see an actor go in the opposite direction, especially when they were once quite good.

Please do yourself a favor and stay clear away from this film. Yes! It's that bad.",1378771200,12,1257,4.305084745762712
5733381,1,B00CPTUO3W,"If you want to experience the full effect of this movie without shelling over the $4 on the rental, simply find a closet, close the door and turn off the lights, and repeatedly smash a pair of cymbals in front of your face for 90 minutes.  That should just about do it.  At first, I thought about comparing this movie to a high school film project, but that'd be insulting to high school students.  Christian Slater... Wow, what a disappointment.  It's all been downhill since ""Heathers.""  Back then, everyone thought he was going to be the next Jack Nicholson.  HA!",1378684800,,566,4.61
5733382,3,B00CPTUO3W,"This movie gets a nod because it one of the few recent hard science scifi flicks and does a good  job of sticking to this theme. The acting is good and the characters believable. The story line holds up for the most part, only the ending disappoints. Exterior scene special effects are low budget but the interior sets are pretty good and that where the majority of the actions is set. All and all, a pretty good space alien saga with some worthwhile scenes.",1378512000,4,458,4.4523809523809526
5733383,1,B00CPTUO3W,"Watching the first few minutes of this movie I wondered how it ever got made. It looks like it was shot on a set made in someone's garage, but not in a good way. The dialog is terrible and the acting is ridiculously bad but  probably its worst sin is it's boring-- mind-numbingly boring.

Wait till it comes out on NetFlix, and then still don't watch it.",1378512000,7,354,4.268656716417911

5733398,1,B00CPTUO3W,"This movie is SO bad. There is no logic to it at all. They say something like ""We have to quarantine her"" and then ALL OF THEM are constantly in the room with her... not that any kind of quarantine would work when all four of them have already been exposed and there are ventilation shafts all over the place. Or the doctor would be like ""she has to be under constant supervision."" Which apparently meant no one was to be anywhere near her. I was just completely astonished any of the actors could say those lines with a straight face. I wonder who Christian Slater owed money to/ was blackmailed by.",1377993600,2,600,4.366071428571429
5733399,2,B00CPTUO3W,"There is no character introduction. The film opens as a lunar mining station, inspired by Legos, is hit my meteors. Communication is lost. The meteors contain spores. One of the crew (Amy Matysio) soon goes Sigourney Weaver on them as they battle the quickly reproducing creature. Her name is Cameron, the same as ""Aliens 2"" director.

The overall view of the lunar station is a joke, while other special effects are okay. There are a limited number of characters, none of which are developed. The plot is sci-fi predictable and after a nearly a half century of this stuff, it serious needs something besides Christian Slater to be done again.

Borderline rental at best.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. The crippled lunar station had enough power and water for Amy Matysio to take a teaser shower.",1377561600,4,809,4.8478260869565215
