2628675,4,B000H5U5TO,"I really enjoy this DVD and series, but the episodes are out of order!  They do not follow the order in which they were aired on television.  This is obvious if you watch them in the order they are on the DVD.  Check on IMDb for the correct chronological order and the season will make much more sense!",1184976000,9,302,4.172413793103448
2628676,3,B000H5U5TO,"This is one of my favorite seasons, I have all Ellen DVDs. However, one odd thing about this dvd is that the first volume of the dvd plays pretty much in every dvd player, even in Europe... they're not region code 1, just like all the other Ellen Seasons. But the weirdest thing is that volume 2 and 3 of Season 5 are all of the sudden region code 1 and they don't play on a European DVD Player. Sure I can watch the episodes on a computer but that is kinda annoying and it absolutely doesn't make any sense that in one dvd pack 1 works for Europe and the 2 other ones don't.

Also I would have appreciated if there had been subtitles for people hard of hearing.

So I have to say, I love the Ellen sit-com but the ones that put it on DVD, they kinda screwed up.",1182988800,4,762,4.006578947368421
2628677,5,B000H5U5TO,"I saw Ellen when it was first shown on British TV in the 1990s. Every episode was packed with funny lines, physical comedy and accurate and hilarious observations. Ellen Degeneres is a brilliant comedy actress and an amazing stand up comedian. The supporting cast too are all excellent. If you haven't discovered Ellen yet and you enjoy laughing then buy this series. You will not be dissappointed.",1169337600,3,398,4.955223880597015
2628678,5,B000H5U5TO,This show is my favorite by a long shot and this season is the best. I LOVE ELLEN!!!,1168387200,,84,3.7222222222222223
2628679,5,B000H5U5TO,This is a great season to have as it is the last season. It has some of the funniest shows and brings important issues out. These are all presented with Ellen's unique brand of humor. If you have purchased season four this is a must have.,1168300800,2,238,4.195652173913044
2628680,1,B000H5U5TO,"In their ignorance, A&E stripped all closed captions from the DVD's all episodes of this series. (Also no subtitles)",1168128000,20,116,5.157894736842105
2628681,5,B000H5U5TO,"There are lots of memorable moments from this last season of Ellen,  but my favorite thing on this set is the two part tribute episode that served as the series' finale. It's hilarious and very clever.  It takes you back in time to  the 1950's as if Ellen's sitcom had started way back then.  It follows Ellen's show through the decades, recreating the look and culture through the years. It's a star filled feature, very well written. One segment has  various stars like Helen Hunt auditioning to play the role of ""Ellen"" before DeGeneres got the role. In the 1970's there is even an Ellen Saturday morning cartoon and breakfast cereal.  Genius.  Stars like Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Aniston, Tim Conway, Christine Lahti, and Jada Pinkett Smith are especially funny.",1167177600,8,767,4.89922480620155
2628682,4,B000H5U5TO,"I really loved Ellen's WHOLE 5 seasons, altho my favorite episodes on th season 5, are the ones where she is dating Laurie. It's a shame the network pulled the plug on the show (and replaced with another Gay show - Will & Grace!!!) when things were starting to get ""good"" between Laurie & Ellen!

I had to skip over a few of the episodes since I found them pretty lame (the talk show ones, civil war one, the research - basically all the ""non-Gay"" ones!), and especially the last two of the Hollywood ""tribute"" to Ellen - which were both pretty stupid. Sorry just my two cents!",1164931200,4,577,4.342592592592593
8136811,4,B000H5U5TO,"Great season! I purchased all seasons and they all played fine on a region 2 DVD player, including volume 1 of season 5. However volume 2 and 3 do not play on the same DVD player which is very strange. Also the episodes are out of order. I can play season 5 volume 1 and 2 on my computer without any trouble.",1516147200,,308,3.9838709677419355
8136812,4,B000H5U5TO,"I love the show and would ordinarily give it 5/5 but for the fact the episodes are out of order, which kind of ruins the chronology of the series so I have taken off a star.

The running order is as follows:

Disc 1 - episodes 2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9
Disc 2 - episodes 10, 8, 11, 13, 12, 17, 14
Disc 3 - episodes 16, 15, 22, 18, 21, 19, 20

How could they make such a monumentally stupid mistake?",1487894400,,395,3.623529411764706
8136813,4,B000H5U5TO,"Seasons 1 through 4 were great.  But in season 5, we get clobbered over the head with I AM GAY.  We get it Ellen.  But still pretty good, but not as good as the other seasons.",1475366400,,175,3.8055555555555554
8136814,5,B000H5U5TO,Great description and delivery i got this alot sooner than expected and it works great,1466380800,,86,4.8
8136815,5,B000H5U5TO,Very funny. I love Ellen. Worth every penny I paid. Fast shipping,1462147200,,65,4.5
8136816,5,B000H5U5TO,I just adore Ellen DeGeneres.  Her show was ground breaking and I am so pleased to finally complete the entire series with season 5.,1299628800,2,132,4.5
8136817,5,B000H5U5TO,I have the seasons one through four as well and all I can say is that Ellen is as good as always. I simply love her way of overdoing things and her humour beats me. Well worth the purchase!,1253491200,2,189,3.871794871794872
8136818,5,B000H5U5TO,"I love this final season of Ellen. She has come out, and is now trying out relationships. Same dysfunctional Ellen, but with wonderful lesbian jokes! One of my favourite purchases!",1253059200,4,180,5.033333333333333
8136819,4,B000H5U5TO,"I have the whole show now, and re-watched it all recently after buying.  It was sad to see the show end, and I also watched it from a different prospective than I did last time. I'm older and wiser now, and watched it from the ""what reason did they cancel the show"" perspective.  Wow. I could probably go on and on but I'll just keep it short with: Network television blows my mind at how conservative and closed-minded they can be.  With re-watching it...a lot of her jokes she made on the show make sense to me now, unlike then.  I will have to say about the end of the show...I was like, ""Really?  THAT'S the end?!""  But hey, its a little piece of history I'm glad to own.",1236643200,5,675,4.1937984496124034
8136820,5,B000H5U5TO,"If you like watching Ellen, you will enjoy relaxing and watching these shows in the evening. My 15 year old wanted this for her birthday and she likes watching it.",1215129600,2,163,4.466666666666667
