8472668,4,B0018CAM7A,I bought this from Amazon Germany. I don't think this ever had a series release in the US. It's a good way to get all the episodes but I would like to warn you that it is entirely dubbed into German dialogue wise. I was hoping it just had German subtitles with the original English track. If you're a Hulk Hogan completionist it's good for the collection.,1469059200,,355,4.313432835820896
