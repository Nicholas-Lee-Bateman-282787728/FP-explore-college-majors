5109847,5,B007TSV4GK,"Addiction information from those involved. Enlightening for some, appalling for some, and hopefully encouragement for those who find themselves in addictive situations today. An educational look at a huge American problem. After viewing, the question remained, but that was 14 years ago, what about today? A 2012 bonus viewer's guide provides that up-to-date look at not only where the issues are going, but also suggestions of what an individual can do for themselves, family, and community. THAT makes this set a relevant place to begin TODAY.

SUBTITLES provided.
1 PORTRAIT OF ADDITTION
A somewhat select group of articulate, educated, affluent individuals share about their personal substance addiction. All are vulnerable. How does it happen- What can be done?

2 THE HIJACKED BRAIN
Brain study and what happens through drugs- the pleasure component- brings some light to the addictive process. Is addiction predictable? Recovery?

3 CHANGING LIVES
Is addiction freedom possible? How permanent is a recovery?  What is relapse tendency? 1998 treatment programs are observed- one was used with Moyers' own son.

4 THE NEXT GENERATION
Addiction passage- generation carry-over. 20% of American youth live with a family addict and are at higher risk. Can the cycle be ended?

5 THE POLITICS OF ADDICTION
The US Gov spends millions on the drug war but is it successful? The approach is a crime vs health debate. Adults abuse while telling children to ""just say no.""

8521813,4,B007TSV4GK,The first DVD was too much about peoples lives in the form of interviews and personal stories for my clients to take interest in it but the second DVD was great and showed good material and insightful reflections on addiction.,1492387200,,226,4.675
8521814,5,B007TSV4GK,"I would suggest this series to anyone dealing with addiction or who works in the field of recovery and addiction. I utilize episodes to explain addiction and changes in the brain in a group setting. It helps people in recovery realize that addiction is not a character defect, but a brain disease.
