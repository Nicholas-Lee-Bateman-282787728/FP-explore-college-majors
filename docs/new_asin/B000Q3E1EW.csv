8573170,5,B000Q3E1EW,"THE ENCOUNTER written by Martin M. Goldsmith and starring Neville Brand and George Takei this a well-produced episode. This two-man play is a tour-de-force of acting and drama that is possible and rarely seen from this medium. Some men bury their guilt by making their own prejudices while others carry it as an inherited burden. How do men cope with guilt be it real or imagined and can ordinary circumstances set those emotions off in an unexpected explosion of violence? Neville Brand and George Takei find out.

When I think of TWENTY-TWO written by Rod Serling all I can think of is ""Room for one more."" Haunting stuff. I think everyone remembers Barbara Nichols in this frightfully nightmarish role.

You really have to love WHAT'S IN THE BOX. It is so frenetic and so over the top, but William Demerest, Joan Blondell and  Sterling Holloway really make this one work. It's goofy and inane, but very watchable as cab driver, William Demerest, sees himself killing his wife, Joan Blondell, on their television set. It was written by Martin M. Goldsmith.

A MOST UNUSUAL CAMERA with Fred Clark and written by Rod Serling once again is another tale of a device that can tell the future. It was leisurely directed by John Rich. It could have been better.",1379721600,,1256,4.774193548387097
