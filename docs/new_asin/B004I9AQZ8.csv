4384764,5,B004I9AQZ8,"I've watched all but frogs, I purchased this collection specifically for return of the living dead, which is a lot of campy fun. Swamp thing hasn't aged well in my opinion, but I didn't hate it. Bucket of blood was a very pleasant surprise, like a really good twilight zone episode, I was expecting to like it the least and ended up enjoying it the most. For the price, you really can't go wrong here!",1414627200,,401,4.36

4384767,5,B004I9AQZ8,"All four of these films are classics of the genre, particularly Bucket of Blood which was remade for one of the premium channels sometime in the 90's. The latter doesn't hold a candle to the original. Return of the Living Dead was a great popcorn film, clever, snappy, funny, and horrifying all at once. Featuring the character actors Don Calfa from the short lived NBC series Leg Men and a host of other films, and Clu Gulager who rose to prominence in the TV Western, The Virginian, which you can still catch on the Inspiration network and any number of the new networks that specialize in re-runs that have sprung up in the HDTV age. It's a watchable, gross out horror flick that lampoons the military industrial complex, chemical warfare, and punk all in the space of a couple of hours. One of the greatest moments is when one of the undead grabs the mic of a then abandoned police cruiser and growls ""Send more cops."" I haven't seen the flick since 1985 or so and I still remember it. But I digress.

The reason I purchased this collection is because it featured the film ""Swamp Thing."" The origin of DC Comic's environmental avenger is told in one of horror auteur Wes Craven's early directorial projects. Dick Durock, who reprises the role in both the sequel and the syndicated Universal Studios series, is the man in the suit, who was formerly Alec Holland, a geneticist working on a bio-restorative formula designed to double the world's food supply. The evil Dr. Arcane attempts to steal the formula, which accidentally triggers and explosion, burning Dr. Holland and inadvertently exposing him to the chemical formula that causes rapid plant growth. It might all end there, accept for the efforts of government agent, Alice Cable who steals one of Hollands notebooks containing his vital research.

The film came out in 1981, toward the end of the Grind House studios' heyday, and it bears the earmarks of that particular genre of film making, particularly noticeable in the film's trailer, included in the the special features. Yet, this is not a cheap knockoff low budget flick. The performances are exceptional, the special effects, particularly for a low budget film, are quite good, especially Swamp Thing and the other Arcane creations, and the locations, somewhere in South Carolina, make the absolute perfect backdrop for the film.

While not as slick as some of its contemporaries, Superman the Movie having been released a brief three years prior, Swamp Thing is a very watchable, entertaining film, with great performances by Louis Jordan and Adrienne Barbeau. The love story is a bit rushed, and the mercenaries in Dr. Arcane's employ seem more like comic relief than any serious threat, but as I stated before, its essentially a Grind House film, and the other characters are meant to carry the story along until the appearance of the titular character and then give him something to battle against.

By today's superhero film standard set by Nolan's Batman films and Marvel Studio's powerhouse catalog, its kind of slow and clunky, but let's face it, this ain't the superhero first string. Swamp Thing would be more at home with his grittier contemporaries like V for Vendetta (Alan Moore having worked on Swamp Thing back in the 80's), and perhaps the Dolf Lundgren version of The Punisher. Yet it is still superior in scope and performance that the 2006 film version of his Marvel Comics binary, Man Thing.

Well worth the time spent watching it, and superior to it's sequel, The Return of Swamp Thing, although the latter gives more screen time and much more dialogue to the title character. Swampy even gets to have a little fun and a romance with then newcomer Heather Locklear.",1401580800,3,3708,4.870047543581617
4384768,4,B004I9AQZ8,"Love those old 80's movies. Horror movies that now strike me as comedies. 1 - 2 - 3.....""WHOA make-up!!!!!"" They just don't do it like that anymore, and for good reason. Well, some new movies still have stone age make-up artists, but anyway, moving on.

The product arrived on time, in good condition, blah blah blah yakety schmackety. No complaints.",1371859200,2,350,4.833333333333333
