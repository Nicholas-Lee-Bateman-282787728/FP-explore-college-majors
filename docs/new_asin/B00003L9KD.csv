7919073,4,B00003L9KD,I am relieved not to be David's psychologist or his anything as I can only imagine what temperament or personality is necessary to cause such anger and hatred toward such time honored and lovable characters. I am forced to wonder if he would also cheer the hunter who shot Bambi's mother. Perhaps he would find Hanibal Lector a more appealing character.,1142985600,,353,4.80327868852459
7919074,1,B00003L9KD,"Who cares about this weird bird. I hate this cartoon character. Sometimes I wish Sylvester would just grab Tweety, put him in his mouth, & swallow him. If Tweetys head is way to big Sylvester should use a shink ray. This cartoon doesent talk right. Thats whats so weird about this bird. I don't have a looney tune character I like. So far I also hate Elmer.",1081814400,,357,4.343283582089552

7919076,1,B00003L9KD,"There is only one ""Tweety Bird"" cartoon on this tape. And it is a very primitive early version of Tweety, which is totally unrecognizable. The rest are all pretty badly done cartoons that Warner's never bothered to copyright,hence their appearence on this video. I wish I had not bought it.",963446400,5,290,4.82
