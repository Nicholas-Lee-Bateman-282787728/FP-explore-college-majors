8033023,5,B0002VEUQC,"After seeing Kamal Ahmed's ""God has a rap sheet"" I was floored with every moment of the story,and realized very early on that this was brave and bold text for a little independant. The story takes place in a seedy holding cell on a hot summer's night,where eight men of different agenda's share their thoughts with a bum who insists he's God. No punches are held as they conflict with each other on subjects such as race,religion,sex and morality. ""God"" doesn't get ""preachy"" with the inmates either,he matter of factly explains his opinions in a earthy,blue-collar way,that had me laughing and scratching my head in amazement. I feel, in today's times,this movie should be used as a example of hope for our dark future.",1127606400,3,720,4.814516129032258
8033024,2,B0002VEUQC,"""God Has A Rap Sheet,"" is a movie that wants to good but is numbingly flawed. Essentially, the premise of the film is that several characters of mixed races find themselves in prison in an over-night holding cell and exchange in a war of words between each other; sometimes peacefully and other times angrily. Within the cell too is an old and dirty homeless man claiming to be God. I understand what the director was trying to do here, which is essentially to create a dialogue between the different races of New York. However, there are several things I did not like in this film and are listed as follows:

  1) As the film begins it is established how everyone got arrested. However, later in the film only one or two of these stories is examined further and at an inconsistent pace.

  2) The acting in the film is inconsistent too. While maybe the actors playing ""God,"" ""the Arab,"" and ""the Jew"" are believeable the rest seem out of place in their roles and the acting between them seems fake and shallow (if you see the film, you'll know what I mean).

  3) The actions between the characters is too repetitious and follows something of: Action-Conflict-Confrontation-Resolution. This goes in a circular motion till each character has confronted each and every other. (those who've seen the film will notice the British and Asian-American record executive tandem that stick out, acting wise, like a sore-thumb.

  4) Each character seems to have a good understanding of one or two races, but at the same time, is completely oblivious to the others. The African and Latino can relate to the Italian, but think all Jews are lawyers and sleep with money (literally). The Irish can understand the Italian but God help him if he can understand ""n@ggers and s@icks."" The Arab man understands the Latino and Black people, but won't let his children watch t.v. because its polluted with Jewish propaganda...and on and on. Meanwhile God, mediates the whole conversation with seemingly obvious solutions to their problems. True that people are ignorant, but the nature of truth is not as black and white as the director seems to assume in this film. And the answers not as seemingly obvious as presented.

  ""God Has A Rap Sheet's"" redeeming quality however is that it seeks to do good by examining the ""Miranda Complex"" that exist's in the international society and locally within American culture. The film is brave in its examination of this. However, I only feel that it is deserving of two stars for being overly preachy, stylistically inconsistent, and poorly acted.",1104019200,6,2569,4.8466819221967965
