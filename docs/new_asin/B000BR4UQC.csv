2438066,5,B000BR4UQC,"I love Ana & Ravi. Their Kundalini DVD's are my favorite. Their instruction is perfect.

This DVD starts with a breath primer and then it moves into an amazing challenging workout which works through all the Chakras. The Chakras are all about your life and they present the information along with the exercises so you know what you need to do to work through any type of block you can imagine. On top of this, this DVD works on flexibility, stress relief,  abs, and total body conditioning, It can be broken up into 2 sessions. Upper Chakras and lower Chakras. If you want to stretch, tone, relax, move, or just balance your Chakras this is the one.",1141689600,16,649,4.538461538461538
2438067,5,B000BR4UQC,"I am responding to the persons review who said this DVD is just breathing exercises. That's like saying a Cray Super Computer is just a bunch of wires. First of all this is a tough workout (am wondering if it was this DVD they even watched?). All parts of the body get covered. There is stretching, strengthening, ab work (I love this part!) and breathing.  It feels like my chakras are glowing!

If you want a thorough workout that will leave you feeling radiant this is the one!",1141430400,16,480,4.443181818181818
2438068,2,B000BR4UQC,"When I read the reviews for this, no one bothered to mention that its all breathing exercises. If you're looking for yoga poses, this is not for you.",1141171200,27,149,4.357142857142857
2438069,5,B000BR4UQC,I found this DVD to be exactly what I needed. I had been very sick and confined to my bedroom and the division of the exercises gave me the option to do as much or as little as I could manage. I felt like I had done something no matter what. In addition it allows you to start out easy and go the the harder section as your ability improves. Definitely was a good buy.,1137283200,14,368,3.92
2438070,5,B000BR4UQC,"I never get bored with the ravi and ana workouts. They are one hell of a challenge but leave you feeling completely relaxed and stress free after doing them. They are quite and accomplishment to complete but the exercises are doable for everyone. I keep doing these workouts and getting stronger each day. Kundalini Yoga is wonderful. I mix it in with my other practices (mostly Hatha) but can't live without that ""yoga high"" I get after doing this workout.",1131408000,20,457,4.725
2438071,5,B000BR4UQC,"I did this DVD Sunday morning and I have to say that it is one great class!!  You start with the lower chakras in the first set and do Sat Kriya and a meditation at the end of the set.  The second set is for the heart, throat, third eye and crown chakras.  There are 3 meditations in this set that are absolutely wonderful.  Unlike his other DVD's, Ravi and Ana can be heard saying the mantras just like you are in an actual class. I only wish that they had put the meditations by name in the menu because I would like to repeat them when I do other kundalini yoga sets.  I plan on doing this one at least once every 2 weeks.",1131321600,11,625,3.968
2438072,5,B000BR4UQC,"Finally a chakra practice that actually involves the chakras! I have recently purchased other so called chakra workouts that strangely enough had nothing to do with chakras at all!

 These exercises most of which are 2-4 minutes are designed to stimulate, balance and transform our kundalini or, life energy.

I really like the way this yoga works every part of you, neck, arms, legs, spine as well as glands, organs, i.e., liver, kidneys, heart and brain!

All the exercises are done with specific breaths. There is a short breath primer to start that makes it all simple as pie.

I found the exercises fun and accesible and overall felt the workout very complete and energizing.

Ana Brett has a very impressive form and presence. Ravi Singh who we don't actually see here on camera offers much interesting chakra information so we can find where our own blocks are and concentrate on those specific areas.",1130457600,15,908,4.863636363636363
2438073,5,B000BR4UQC,"I would say this one is for all levels. It is not knock you out super hard but you do get a thorough work out and work up a sweat, and it is super effective, more so then some workouts that are designed to make you sweat a storm!  This one is designed to balance the chakras and learn about what issues the chakras relate too. Like if you have low self esteem you would need to work on your 3rd chakra etc...Super interesting and everytime you listen you pick up more!

I love the way this DVD works up the bodys energy centers one by one.  First there is a short series of spinal warmups then a couple standing exercises for grounding(1st chakra).

Then there is a lot of hip opening, which I love, for chakra # 2. Then there is a cardio exercise called frogs which gets the heart pumping and then camel. Those work all 3 lower chakras plus the heart. Then we do a cool meditation then rest on the back.  Then we start the navel work which is a powerful abdominal sequence that I feel for 2 days afterwards.

That is the end of the first set then if you have time you start on the rest of the chakras starting with opening the heart center and then the throat and the aura. Or you can skip the first set and start with the heart. I love the exercises in this last set designed to clean up the energy field surrounding your body and protect you from negativity and increase your radiance! Very empowering.

Both sets are really fun and I recommend doing them all at once is you have over an hour.

I have to say no one else does Kundalini Yoga like Ravi Singh & Ana Brett. They consistently get it just right.  I eagerly await more from them!",1129507200,37,1642,4.170886075949367

2438087,2,B000BR4UQC,"I did not care for this practice at all.  I felt the white background to be too intense, especially when trying to concentrate on breathing.  Overall I felt the production to be fairly grating in sound and quality, but I can see how the practice minus everything else would be extremely beneficial.  I have been practicing Iyengar yoga for about 15 years, so am just now getting into Kundalini.  I have since ordered Kundalini Yoga With Gurmukh and will hopefully obtain a better guided practice.  I realize what they were going for here...minimal background as to not take away from the focus on breath and correct movement/alignment, however it did not sit well for me unfortunately!",1421193600,,685,4.870689655172414

2438092,5,B000BR4UQC,"I am in my mid 40's and have had Asthma for  a long time. Strengthening the lungs and improving lung capacity is highly beneficial for the lessening of Asthma attacks and symptoms. Kundalini yoga focuses on breath work more so than other forms of yoga and is very beneficial for people with Asthma. There are a lot of breathing exercises in this video and with the exception of  just a couple of poses, one does not have to turn into a human pretzel. Modifications are given for the more challenging poses so its possible to do this video even if you are not the least bit flexible. You can also choose to skip the too challenging poses.

Kundalini Yoga is different from the popular styles of yoga that are in studios in virtually every town in the US. There is less twisting into pretzels. The main focus is on the breath, meditation, the chakras, and deepening one's spirituality. That one receives a cardio workout from the breath work is a huge benefit. Holding poses that are easy to get into (when done at your own pace and with your needed modifications) tones the muscles through isometrics and deepens one's concentration.
My energy was improved after the first session.

For people who are new to the breath work in Kundalini yoga, it is very important not to eat or drink for a while prior to doing Kundalini yoga. I think they recommend not eating or drinking for 2 or more hours prior, except for light snacks as needed for health issues. However, doing Kundalini yoga after eating can make a person very nauseated. Additionally, someone who is new to breath work may become very nauseated from the breath work. This is caused by the release of toxins in your body. If you find yourself nauseated, stop for the day and try to do it again the next day. You should be able to do it for a longer period of time before nausea sets in, if it sets in at all. Once you have rid your body of toxins through Kundalini breathing, you will be able to do the breath work with no nausea. The thought of buying something that may cause nausea that has to be overcome may sound like a huge deterrent, but think of the flip side which is the cause of the nausea - toxins in your body. And then think about how significantly and quickly you are improving your health by doing Kundalini yoga and ridding your body of those toxins.",1395532800,4,2326,4.465882352941176
2438093,5,B000BR4UQC,"Whenever I feel very stressed, this is my go to DVD to achieve a state of calm. The chanting meditations throughout the DVD are beautiful and they along with the kundalini yoga exercises lead me to a place where I feel ever so peaceful.

2438104,5,B000BR4UQC,"I always feel so good after doing yoga (led by Anna & Ravi via videos).  Kundalini is definitely a different style of yoga; all I know is that I feel really good, emotionally, after doing Kundalini.  And I really enjoy the way Ana & Ravi teach.",1389830400,2,244,4.282608695652174
2438105,5,B000BR4UQC,Bliss.  This is a great DVD for getting balanced and feeling great. I love that you can customize the workout.  All their DVDs are like that and it is great.,1387929600,,157,4.2
2438106,5,B000BR4UQC,"I have 17 of Ana & Ravi DVD's which says it all
I think they are the best teachers of Kundalini Yoga ( Maya fines is also OK and the others are far behind)
The flow of the practice, explantions, variety, music - all sums up to great daily practice I enjoy
The matrix option is not the best, but it does allow you to build your own set for the day.
Havind said that - this DVDis one of the first I bougt but I reaerly use it, because it is quite hard for me and too long to all , and the partial sets I can build usually don't sum up to a good class as my favorites: transformer, dance the chakras , bliss hips and the  first beginners and byond",1386633600,2,644,3.8421052631578947
2438107,4,B000BR4UQC,I liked the stretching and the breathing as well as the meditation and chanting; was easy to follow and was easy to make time for.,1386288000,,130,4.24
2438108,5,B000BR4UQC,"Excellent Yoga video, I highly recommend it.  The newer version of this has nice video effect colors added to Ana's chakras during the meditations that helps a person figure it out and also there are more of the helpful comments that come from her as well as Ravi on this.",1384732800,,272,4.44
2438109,5,B000BR4UQC,I wasn't going to review this since so many have reviewed it so glowingly already but when I saw the review that said this is not Kundalini I had to speak up! This is most certainly Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan. Ravi Singh is a longtime KY teacher and student of Yogi Bhajan.  He is the most humble wise grounded and encouraging teacher I have ever come across in the Kundalini world. I have just signed on for a Teacher Training with Ravi & Ana (also an amazing and gifted teacher) and I most certainly would not do that if their Kundalini Yoga was not the most authentic style of Kundalini Yoga I have found. Journey Through the Chakras is an amazing journey you won't want to miss. Full of great exercises and exciting information on the Chakra journey and it is 100 percent Kundalini Yoga! I would be an absolute shame if you let someone's totally misguided information keep you from experiencing these powerful and authentic teachers.,1382227200,7,950,4.588235294117647
2438110,1,B000BR4UQC,This is not Kundalini yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan. Do not waste your time -I erroneously bought many of this couple's DVDs and completely regret it.,1381276800,,150,4.592592592592593
2438111,5,B000BR4UQC,"First time trying Kundalini Yoga.  Didn't know much about Chakras.  I feel high from deep breathing and chanting for over an hour.  I can see why people find yoga so euphoric.  Definitely try this journey.  It is worth the time, very moving, very effective.  I really feel much more relaxed and ready to continue my life more positively.  I wish they had put the breath of fire tutorial at the beginning.  I knew what it was but it is a good refresher.  If you don't know how, watch that segment before starting.",1379635200,3,512,4.478260869565218
2438112,4,B000BR4UQC,This is a decent workout video and have used it on occasion over the years.  There are not many kundaline videos online so if you are thinking of giving it a try this is a good place to start.,1375401600,,192,3.923076923076923
2438113,4,B000BR4UQC,"I like it a lot better than the last one of theirs that I bought. I love how it goes through the chakras, that's amazing. So much breath of fire though, it's a lot, but going through the chakras is amazing.",1370822400,2,206,4.048780487804878

If you are really looking to improve your health, lose weight or simply explore this art of Yoga take my advice and give their DVDs a shot, I bet you won't be dissapointed, they are better than any instructor led class.

2438125,5,B000BR4UQC,"I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD out there.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there via DVD and at the (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

2438126,5,B000BR4UQC,"I own most of RaviAna's DVDs and this is one of my favorites.  At 90 minutes, it is one of their longer practices.  However, it is well worth the time to do this workout on a regular basis.  It has been so valuable to me to work each and every one of the chakras so that I can feel at my best.  Although the practice is long, it never feels long.  I'm always surprised when I come to the end of the practice.  If I am feeling badly, Journey Through the Chakras almost always makes me feel much better.  Although you can break it up, I do recommend doing the whole practice at once.  I know it is a time commitment, but you will not regret it.  This practice will make everything you do afterwards that much better.  I would also like to mention how much I like how the two instructors end the practice....first you visualize yourself healthy and happy; then you visualize someone who needs healing energy; then, finally, you visualize the world as a peaceful place.  Their unique way of ending their practices is the perfect last note before getting off your mat.",1360195200,3,1063,4.372448979591836

While I couldn't come close to doing a lot of these exercises, I didn't feel discouraged, I felt more inspired.  They were really good about giving people alternative suggestions/modifications.  I really liked integrating the chakras as that is something that I do have experience in.  I think that this video is one that I can work with without being discouraged.  It will take me awhile to get there but I could see this routing being sustainable for the long term vs. a ""beginner"" only video.",1353196800,3,585,4.696078431372549

The instructions were top notch which is why these video's and their instructors stand out. Something that I found distracting in this video was Ana Brett herself. She was clearly not wearing any support garment during this video and because she was wearing a tight fitting outfit..well you get the rest. I found this to be very distracting especially during sequences when she was doing a lot of thrusting forward with her upper body. From the dvd covers I've seen this outfit appears to be her regular attire. I'm glad I just rented because I'm not sure it's something I could move past.

This is my favorite DVD of all the Raviana DVDS and they all are great. i love this one espescially because i love the classic white background, Anas beautiful look in her lightblue outfit and of course the exercise sequence which is very long (1 and a half hours) but afterwards it leaves you feeling like you have accomplished a lot - actually a real journey through the chakras!!!",1318377600,6,879,4.751633986928105

This DVD is the 10th (and 11th) in my collection. Two brand new, cellophaned dvds and neither of them will play all the way thru.  I am very, very disappointed.

So, my review isn't so much towards the content of this dvd since I can't do it. My other Kundalini yoga DVDs are awesome. There must be something about this batch? So disappointed.  :(",1312848000,2,523,4.371134020618556

I especially like the ""matrix"" feature where you can chose your own workout, even repeating a segment if you want.  This is so convenient.  you can easily skip any explanation parts after viewing them the first time.

I bought this one because I was curious to make a journey through the chakras.  As the first reviewer said, that kind of makes this less of a work out video - more of a meditative one - nonetheless there are some difficult strength poses.  All in all I would say if you like kundalini you will love this video.  If you are new to kundalini I would suggest the yoga for flexibility one to try first",1312416000,5,714,4.363636363636363

2438174,5,B000BR4UQC,"In Kundalini yoga there is a huge focus on the breath, this makes for an energizing, cleansing, aerobic workout.  With or without the breath of fire, the exercises are tough for doable.

I have been doing yoga for roughly 8 months now (including a handful of other raviana dvds), and I found this dvd to be a thorough and challenging workout.

Just a quick word for those who haven't tried a raviana dvd or Kundalini yoga yet:  When I first tried them, I was a little startled at the breathing exercises (their dvds introduced me to Kundalini yoga), the breath of fire burns at first and it feels like you are hyperventilating.  The burning quickly goes away after cleaning out the toxins and you won't hyperventilate.

I also was a bit surprised at the ""new-age"" feel and Ana's skimpy outfits.  Please get over your inhibitions and give it a try, their yoga is truly life-changing and beautiful, don't let first impressions ruin the experience for you.",1299542400,5,953,4.704819277108434
2438175,5,B000BR4UQC,"NOTE:  I own the NON-matrix version of this DVD.

This DVD offers two Kundalini yoga sets, one for the lower chakras and one for the upper chakras.  In their brief introduction, co-instructors Ravi Singh and Ana Brett state that you can do either the entire practice at once or break it up into sections.  The set is the plain white studio that was featured in all of Ana & Ravi's DVDs of this era; as always, Ana portrays the exercises, but Ravi does the voiceover cuing exclusively.

The Main Menu of the DVD reads as follows (I've added times and brief descriptions in parentheses):

Play DVD (it its entirety, 92 minutes total)
Breath Primer (4.5m; instruction on long deep breathing and breath of fire, or BOF)
Breath Exercise for Chakra Balance (3.5m; 8-part inhale, focusing on each of the chakras in turn, and 1-part exhale)
Warm-Ups (4m; spinal flexon in 3 different positions)
Set One
Set Two

In the upper-right hand corner of the Main Menu, there is a little tiny menu that says ""Set Menus.""  If you click on it, it will take you to another screen which breaks down the two sets into chapters.  I have listed the Set Menus below as well as have provided information on the individual exercises.  (Note:  When you are on the Main Menu, if you do nothing, the DVD starts playing automatically.)

SET ONE (37.5 minutes total)
*Chakra One-Grounding (9m)--bow & arrow pose and Kundalini tree pose, each held for a good bit of time
*Chakra 2-Expression (5.5m)--crow pose (or alternate frog) w/BOF, butterfly w/forward bend, Kundalini lotus (wide-legged seated balance)
*Lower Chakra Mini Set (9.5m)--frog, camel w/BOF, child's pose, sat kriya (about 3 minutes), brief relaxation
*Chakra 3-Personal Power (9.5)--performed lying on back:  criss-cross legs w/BOF, alternate leg lifts w/BOF, repeat criss-cross legs, double leg lifts w/BOF, repeat criss-cross legs
*Meditation #1 (4m)--meditation is ""wahay guru sat nam-hari hari ram ram;"" first half is repeated while squeezing the rectum, sex organs, navel, and diaphragm, and then the second half while releasing those same areas in sequence

SET TWO (42.5 minutes total; this entire set is performed seated)
*Chakra 4-Love (9m)--seesaw arms, exercise w/one armed raised; finish w/4-minute meditation for navel/heart center:  while performing sequence of hand movements, repeat ""so hung-har har har har-so hung""
*Chakra 5-Creativity (11m)--move head side-to-side w/arms pumping in & out; seated on heels, do BOF first with head stretched up, then with chin to chest; finish w/4-minute meditation for throat center: repeat sat nam 6x while moving up the chakras, finishing with a wahay guru above the head
*Chakra 6-8-Intuition, Energy, Radiance, Transcendence (9m)--3 moves to focus on final 3 chakras:  hands in Venus lock overhead for third eye, hands interlaced overhead, and hands interlaced overhead with index fingers up, adding BOF to last and moving arms out to side
*Deep Relaxation (2.5m)
*Meditation #2 (4m)--repeat the first meditation from the end of Set 1, but add a focus on the upper chakras as well
*Meditation #3 (<4m)--""7 wave sat nam,"" which involves inhaling to sat for each of the 6 chakras and then exhaling to nam
*Affirmations (2m)--positive closing statements offered by Ravi
*Closing Prayer (1m)--positive wishes to self, other, and world, and a final sat nam

I enjoyed this practice.  I especially liked how some of the meditations (e.g., the heart and throat meditations) were worked into the sets instead of all of the meditation work being saved for the end of the practice (as with some of Ravi & Ana's other DVDs).  I didn't feel that any of the exercises dragged on endlessly, although the work on the navel center (Chakra 3) was definitely quite challenging.  Although I didn't particularly enjoy the throat meditation (it moved VERY quickly, and it was hard for me to keep track of the chakras during the exercise), I loved the meditation for the navel/heart centers, and I thought that the 7 wave sat nam was quite nice also.

Overall, this is a nice addition to my small collection of Kundalini yoga DVDs.  I think it would be doable to someone new to Kundalini yoga provided that 1) they have SOME prior yoga experience, and 2) they take Ravi's suggestion to break down the practice into shorter chunks.  On final analysis, I would rate this DVD about 4 1/2 stars.",1287532800,19,4359,5.0152565880721225
2438176,5,B000BR4UQC,"What I love about JOURNEY, which was my introduction to the incredible DVD series by Ravi and Ana, is that it is so COMPREHENSIVE.

It takes you from working the first chakra, at the base of the spine, all the way up to the eighth chakra (above the top of the head), offering several deep moves and explanations for each spot.

After you've done it a few times, you can even implement these exercises yourself, if you think you need a boost on certain issues. I've been known to work my throat chakra, for example, when I need to write or say something important.

Kundalini yoga is an amazing technology, and Ravi and Ana in ALL their DVDs give it to you in the most beautiful, open, concise, and undogmatic way you can imagine!",1284595200,4,729,4.425373134328358
2438177,5,B000BR4UQC,"This workout represents the essence of yoga for me.  It's all about your mind and breathing. This is a great workout for those who want to go deeper into Kundalini yoga.

What I especially enjoyed about this DVD:

**meditative focus on each chakra.  You are doing some gentle poses, but the true focus is on meditation and breathing.

**Ravi explains which chakra(s) you're working.  This helps me to really focus on the correct area.

**Ravi's translation of what each chakra means.  For example, the throat chakra represents your ability to speak up for yourself.  These explanations help make the workout more relevant to my life.

**the short meditations after each section.  This helps me get very centered and calm.

**how I feel after doing the workout. I feel alive and centered.  I was surprised at how energized I felt since I don't think of this workout as true exercise.

**the workout structure splits the lower and upper chakras, so it's quite easy to focus on specific chakras.  Ravi also emphasizes that the lower chakras are not necessarily bad, even though they represent more mundane functions.  This is good to remember.

If you're new to Kundalini yoga, I would not recommend starting with this workout.  Any of Ravi and Ana's other workouts would be more appropriate for an introduction.

I don't do this workout a lot, since I need to be in a certain mindset.  But, it's a welcome change from all the intense cardio and heavy weight training that I usually do.  I also enjoy doing this workout before spending the day hiking or kayaking.

I highly recommend this workout for anyone wanting a deeper Kundalini yoga experience.",1284249600,6,1648,4.85251798561151
2438178,5,B000BR4UQC,"A Journey through the Chakras with Ana and Ravi

I have a good selection of Ana and Ravi's Kundalini DVD's and this one is among my favourites...I say that but I cannot really pick a favourite as I find them all wonderful to work with.

Filmed on a pure white background the visual imagery is beautiful and clear and easily followed. The music and sound production is of high quality and very fitting with the practice.

There is a menu to select from and the choice is yours really, which is great if you want to work on a certain area in your life and related chakra or if you have time limits. You can do what you want, choose for yourself or you can do the whole practice from beginning to end.

The whole class begins with an intro to the chakra system and then goes on to teach long deep breathing and breath of fire which will be used throughout the class. The there is a tune in via mantra. Then the journey through the chakras begins with the root chakra and continues systematically through them all. I really like the structure and exercises, the lower three chakras really worked me strong and I enjoyed it. Ana presents the postures beautifully and Ravi explains and encourages throughout. There are some lovely meditations during the journey and at the end and the class does include a short savasana (corpse pose, lying down relaxing deeply) before finally ending with a tune out via mantra.

I feel grounded, energised, calm, clear and blissful at the end of this class.........it is wonderful.

I had practiced hatha yoga for approx 1 year prior to discovering Kundalini yoga. Kundalini is now my main practice, as I realised it was what I had been looking for when I began practice. I always work within my limitations on any given day, which for me can be varied.

Ana & Ravi are fabulous teachers! They always make the workout fun and the ease of their instruction, smoothness of their voices, to the lovely choice exercises they teach is thoroughly engaging! In fact, every DVD they make has a wonderful feel and works its magic, yet they have a wonderful variety.

This Chakra tape is the best Chakra focused class I have ever done, and I have done a lot! Its a lovely set of exercises - about 3 for each chakra. The exercises are powerful but all doable and I can feel the healing happening as I go through the class!

This really helps me to get past the surface frustrations of my everyday life and get deep and in touch with who I really am. I use it whenever I want to feel strong and centered. It is a guaranteed result!

I feel the effects of this still working for me days after the workout. I feel so blessed to have Ana & Ravis guidance for my home practice.

2438187,4,B000BR4UQC,"I enjoyed this dvd, although I kind of prefer the Maya Fiennes one, at least for me as a beginner (to Kundalini, not yoga). This is very comprehensive though. The breath of fire is used a lot, which is very difficult to maintain...I will practice though! My biggest problem with this DVD was the music, to be honest. There's one part of the music (used in the beginning, but recurs) that sounds a bit creepy, like the soundtrack from some crime/mystery drama! The music on Maya Fiennes is ten times better. Being musical, that makes a big difference to me...I will learn it all and then do it with the sound turned down! I was also a bit surprised that there was no chakra visualization stuff during the exercises. Maybe this is normal, but it seems odd to try and release the chakra and not be visualizing the chakra at the same time. But, on the plus side, a great range of exercises and very comprehensive. Perhaps moves a bit too fast, not allowing for time to do the meditations fully...but once u learn them u can do them in your own time whenever. In short, I like this, but it's not as joyful as the Maya Fiennes dvd...it's more, I dunno, 'serious.'",1253232000,7,1157,4.436619718309859
2438188,5,B000BR4UQC,Most chakra DVD's are mostly meditation. This one is the best of both worlds: a top notch physical workout along with the energy work on the chakras. There is also a meditative element after the yoga which will give you an experience like nothing else. I can swear the more I do this the clearer my eyes get and the glossier my hair and skin and the more balanced and happy I feel throughout the day.

2438189,1,B000BR4UQC,"i have not seen the video but this ""Journey through the Chakras"" sounds like it is group voga.  We are all different and when you open up the chakras or the meridians between the organs of the body everybody has different problems, different tensions to deal with in yoga postures.  For several months I have been doing thai yoga massage.  After massaging the feet and using accupressure to open up the meridians the therapist treats every condition individually.  It's basically assisted yoga.  Just you and the practicioner.  Conventional yoga just might damage your back or whatever.",1246924800,2,586,5.052083333333333

I find the exercises raise my energy, and I am noticing that I am going through my days with more energy, I handle stress better ( work in a nursing home for the elderly), am happier and I sleep better. I work an eight hour job where I am moving constantly, in other words I don't sit at a desk, like most people I don't have hours to do yoga every day, I like how the CD is divided into thirty minute sections, or you can do the full hour on days that you have more time, I also like that they explain why you are doing each asana, meditation, bandh, mantra, breathing and mudra, I like to know what and why I am doing something, I feel that in knowing, your thoughts also create energy and can have a fuller impact on what you are working on, such as each chakra or chakras, and moving the energy up the spine etc. I also love the meditations at the end.

In comparison to some other Ravi and Ana's DVD's that I have I would say this one has a moderate level of physical activity and more complex breathing and energy moving exercises then other newer DVD's that they have.

And I absolutely love it!! It's a great introduction to the chakra system. Ravi explains a little bit about each as you are working on them, making the workout seem like more than just a workout. I always like knowing the benefits of a particular exercise~makes it well worth the effort.

This DVD is very thorough and a little longer than some of the others so I usually focus on the chakras I feel need the most work. I particularly love the work on the 3rd chakra (navel center). While I found it pretty challenging at first, the more I practiced the stronger I got and was then able to keep up through the whole thing. They say your navel center is your ""personal power and will"" and if it is strong it will allow YOU to be strong in everything that you do. It's true. I've experienced it with this DVD and also with Navel Power~another favorite of mine.

I read a review a long time ago where someone mentioned having their ""chakras blasted open"". At first I laughed at this expression but then I actually experienced it with this DVD as well as some of their other ones. That phrase stuck in my mind because that's what it feels like. By the time I'm finished I cannot wipe the smile off my face. I just feel so good!

I have all of Ravi & Ana's DVDs and I definitely keep coming back to this one for the variety of the content, the excellent workout and for the feeling that leaves me grinning like a cheshire cat :)",1227312000,10,1588,4.304347826086956

I did this once for a week, I focused on one chakra and did the poses and meditation for that chakra.  I felt so recharged at the end of the week.  I decided to try it that way since it  is a little long for me to do at once. It is an excellent dvd used this way. I will warm up with a walk and then do a section. I love that it has the poses and a meditation together in some segments. Some of the poses are a little advanced. I modify when I have to. This dvd makes me feel so calm and peaceful.  Sometimes I don't even realize I'm ""exercising"". It is great for stretching and for isometrics (example: you sometimes hold your arms up over your head).  Probably the first half (lower chakras) involves more physical exercising/yoga.  The upper chakras are less physical.  If you are looking for a more aerobic yoga dvd, this is not the one.

This DVD is great for those that aren't interested in traditional yoga, have healthy backs, and are in need of a friendly voice to make them feel better.  People that don't meet these expectations will only feel bored and a little brainwashed.",1224201600,10,651,4.890909090909091

Unlike physical exercises these benefits are accumulative and build up over time - even after two years I feel that it opens gradually new levels. For anyone going through a time of transformation, test or is stuck in an emotional past this will support you noon else could.
More than words I recommend to experience these exercise for those who a curious (even though I would first recommend one of the other DVD's of Ravi&Ana). Really give it a go for 3 weeks (best every day) or better a months & see for yourself! This experience will speak for itself.

The moves are challenging yet easy enough for beginners and I absolutely LOVE that everything is explained.  I am so happy I stumbled upon these DVDs.  I have never been so excited to do yoga and meditate. I just purchased another DVD by Ravi and Ana and I cannot wait to get more.

In my metaphysical studies, I have learned how important it is to keep the chakras in balance, and this DVD is the perfect aid in doing just that.  When a chakra is out of balance, it can cause blockages and illness in our lives.

As with all of Ana and Ravi's DVD's, the instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Appropriate modifications are given when a particular pose might be too difficult for someone at a beginning level.  Ana does a superb job of demonstrating each position and the music is great, too.

I always look forward to doing this workout and feel great for hours afterward.  I recommend it highly.",1168387200,27,712,4.551181102362205

It also has a pleasant voice of explanation, which makes it easy to follow the visual instructions.  The music is also pleasant and the view points/camera work to see the postures and alternative postures are superior compaired to other excercise DVD I have worked with.  Some of the postures are a bit advance for me, but I try my best to keep up.  When I complete the DVD, I can feel my spine and hip loose up and a wormth in my root Chakra through out the day.

2438231,5,B000BR4UQC,"This is a great 90 min workout that will also calm your mind & boost your spirits. The stage is blank white (so not to be distracting) with Ana demonstrating & Ravi narrating. He narrates well, telling you what the movements work on, how many more seconds you have to go & gently helping you to challenge yourself when you might think too hard to do.
The music is great, starts & stops for each movement & many have an energizing beat to keep you going.
It starts with teaching you both deep breathing & fire of breath (like dog panting). Fire of breath will be used A LOT. But just do your best, hit the pause button & you'll be ok.
The movements themselves are hard to explain, but usually has two different poses that are done back/forth at as fast as speed as you can handle, even you can only do it slow, that's fine. There's some balancing, some yoga spine rolls, holding your arms up a lot for several minutes (help workout your arms), leg lifts (good leg & ab work), spinal flexing, neck stretches, camel & child's pose, drawing the bow Qi gong pose & more. Though this isn't about building tone, but that is the bonus. This is about healing your organs & your spirit.
If you worry you can't do it perfectly, they show you modifications, though this wouldn't be for those w/injuries or serious back pain, etc.
By using this dvd, I actually did the entire 90 min though it was late at night & I surprisingly wasn't bored by the end of the first set at the 60 min mark.
Everything they said you should feel, you actually do.

2438232,5,B000BR4UQC,"This may sound corny, but I think that if you invest your time in this practice, you really can change your life.  This dvd may be very different than what you are used to but if you keep an open mind and challenge yourself, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the results.  Let me back up here.  I purchased this dvd along with another kundalini yoga dvd because I had read that this form (of yoga) is less stressful to your joints. I wanted to find something that my husband, who suffers from back pain, could gain some relief from. Also, having some yoga experience, I know that percussive and segmented breathing exercises are great stress relievers and I just wanted something that didn't make me jump around like a maniac (so boring after awhile and not so relaxing).  But, I must have been looking for more.  This dvd addresses the different aspects of the body and how to unlock the energy in those areas. These aspects, once opened and energized, make you feel terrific and more capable of letting stress go.  Also, it awakens an awareness of self, the need and desire to improve both mental and physical areas of (your)life.  There is a symmetry and balance that improves your outlook and decision making.

The only thing I would change about this dvd is that when learning some of the meditations, I would have preferred that some of the words stay on the screen the entire segment of time.

Great work out for the mind and the body, you'll have the best zzzz's of your life.",1156723200,95,1484,4.548872180451128

This workout is spritually based and works on the chakras which are basically energy centers in the body. The DVD starts with a little tutorial on the two  types of breathing most commonly used in kundalini yoga. It then goes through meditations and excerizes that work the lower chakras. At that point you can choose to continue or finish with a final mediation. The second half works on the top chakras.

I found most of these excersizes moderately difficult. Some of the excerizes that require balance were difficult for me. I also greatly enjoyed the chanting and the more spiritual aspects of this particular yoga practice.",1155945600,55,882,4.641025641025641

But, I love this DVD.  Well-put-together, pleasant to watch, makes me feel like a queen during and afterward.  I didn't even realize that it was such a long DVD.  Ravi and Ana answered the e-mail I wrote, asking about my spine problem.  They answered rather quicly, and gave me the info I was seeking, plus.  I am getting, as per suggestion, ""Fat-Free Yoga"" for more weight-bearing exercise.  I have done some research, some by the reviews, and have concluded that I do need in addition to do the treadmill or walking for at least 1/2 hour a day if possible.  This is because of Osteopenia - and the need to build bones up.  All my aerobic , muscular, spine and so many needs are taken care of with these DVD's, and if rotated daily, I suspect more good things will happen.  I lost only 5 pounds, and I already look pretty good at 156 lbs.  My stomach has really shrunk.  The core exercises are fantastic.  I am on Weight-watchers, but I am in a higher points range, and only losing 1-2 lbs a week.  Very healthy!  In other words, the DVD's are making me look as if I have lost more weight than I have.  I keep hearing the chanting and music throughout my day, and it is making me feel confident!!  One more thing - I adapt the exercises to what I can do with my spine.  That is ok, because I am getting worked out well anyway.",1154822400,45,1562,4.255102040816326

This dvd is timely, beautiful, inspirational, spiritual and awe inspiring!

I practice this dvd several times a week and since starting I have noticed positive changes in both my body and my spirit. I love this dvd so much, I have ordered extras and given them to my closest friends!

I am as surprised as anyone at how much I love this workout. I find the information about the chakras fascinating and I love the breath work, particularly the breath of fire, combined with the movements. I felt as though I were vibrating from the inside out, and felt an immediate clearing of something almost like a melting in my chest!

When I finished this workout the first time I was in a very Zen-like state which lasted to my (calm) amazement through a week long very hectic business trip. I could not wait to get back and do the workout again.

I love everything about this DVD. Ana & Ravi,  the nicely balanced stretching & strenghening workout, the music (so much better then most yoga programs), the look. I will definitely explore their other offerings and do this one often.",1148428800,70,944,4.57396449704142
2438250,5,B000BR4UQC,"The reviewer below inspired me to write my own experience with doing ""all yoga"" as fitness:
I have recently begun to do all yoga as fitness. I had been doing a pretty high-impact workout routine 6 days a week. Now I do yoga instead for 6 days. I do mostly Ana Brett & Ravi Singh yoga workouts. I I really like their type of yoga because it feels very aerobic. It is a mild form of cardio that feels much healthier to my body then all that hard stepping up and down and running that I had been doing  I have been amazed to see I have finally started losing weight and actually seeing some muscles in my arms legs, back and stomach - all former problem areas.
The only other thing I do, which is something I have always done,l  is walking at a fairly good pace. I live in the city and take about 2 twenty minute brisk walks to the subway and back and then walking to do shopping. I am beginning to think yoga is all I need.",1148169600,10,921,4.054945054945055
2438251,5,B000BR4UQC,"I have recently added a yoga week to my training schedule. One week a month I do only yoga. I like this Kundalini style yoga because it is athletic so I can still gain strength while gaining additional flexibility and lung capacity. I really notice a difference in my stamina when I go back to my regular fitness routine.
I think the continuous practice of this yoga has jumpstarted my wholehearted effort to take my health seriously. I used to carry 10 extra pounds but through working on my glands and doing things that have helped my inner organs I feel I have cleared some energy channels and my body is streamlining.
This Chakra DVD is my Sunday routine. It is a full workout. It takes a little longer then the others if you want to do the whole thing which you will want to. The instruction with Ravis so soothing voice is wonderful. Ms Ana  is simply breathtaking to watch, the music is something I would put on just to listen to in itself -  a rarety in a yoga DVD.
I highly recommend this and also their intro Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond and the Ultimate Stretch Workout. I ultimately plan to buy them all.

I wanted a practice that was more focused on meditation and the chakras and I found the perfect DVD, exactaly what I needed!!!

I read the great reviews in Amazon, and I had to buy it. I'm so glad I did because it's fantastic!!!!!!

These are the things that I like about this practice:

- Great Music

- Like the chanting - even though is not much, you are supposed to chant a few times, which I love!!!

- The exercises were really good - definitely totally different from hatha or vinyasa yoga, which I like, but this a good also... very different but great!

- After doing this DVD I felt centered and very relaxed... something that I sometimes don't get by just doing hatha yoga as it's more physical. This DVD has exercises that you need to combine with breathing techniques and the feeling is awesome. You also meditate between exercises.

- Ana is great!!!! She is very inspiring!!!

- Ravi gives good instructions... I did the whole DVD and that was my first time doing Kundalini yoga. So he is very clear and any beginner can do it.

In sum, I love this DVD and I'm planning on doing it often as I want my energy to flow the way it's supposed thru my chakras. I already went to their website and I'm so lucky because they are coming to my area, so I will definitely do the workshop with them!!!!",1147996800,25,1463,4.388888888888889

This aptly titled DVD: A Journey Through the Chakras gives you a total immersion in this important and exciting model. The Chakras are like the Indian form of psychology, in its own way very sophisticated. The information given is first rate. The instructions are clear and simple to follow.

The entire body is warmed up and worked out as you are taken through each of the exercises. I like that all the talking is done during the exercises so their is no jerky stopping and starting as I have experienced in other yoga workouts. If you are used to the regular type of yoga where you just hold poses this type of yoga should be a real treat for you since it goes way beyond that!",1147996800,6,785,4.451388888888889

This DVD contains great info, and execises for each chakra, for all levels of yogi's, not just beginners.  You can quickly begin to learn which chakra you might be blocked at and actually physically do something about it. Ideally there is a free flow of energy throughtout the chakras which is what these exercises work towards. The exercises work from the ground up and feel very flowing.

When I did it I realized there is really something to this.  Chakras are like life passages, and simply put, if there are traumas in your psychological development then it is as if you didn't graduate that grade. This is a physical workout which works from the ground up - after a couple warm ups it starts with the legs and works its way up the body. This yoga sort of has a martial arts flavor. Very active type of yoga. There is a lot here and I look forward to continuing to explore it.

I had done yoga as a college student in the 1960's and have been meaning to get back to it ever since.  This style of yoga combines breathing, and movements, and poses, and sophisticated sequencing. There is also a strong spiritual aspect.  I guess one notable thing this has done for me is that I'd don't worry as much and I have lots more energy.

Alas, none close by, so I consoled myself by purchasing their Beginners & Beyond and Yoga Total Tune Up. I have been amazed at how practical and all inclusive this system of yoga is. The exercises, while working on opening and balancing the chakras, are strengthening and toning the body while soothing the nervous system. What more could you ask for from any yoga/exercise system?

Ravi & Ana have a great way of explaining how the chakras relate to our daily existence and help us to better understand our inner workings. You can truly learn something about yourself and others in your life with this fantastic DVD.

I also appreciate the way the benefits of everything you do are explained along with the the exercise instead of them stopping and explaining then starting again ( this is too common in DVDs and a pet peeve of mine). They keep the workout flowing so it stays fascinating and very moving throughout.",1145577600,12,1085,4.705263157894737

I have long since worn it out. I now own all nine of Ana Brett & Ravi Singhs DVDs and continue this practice everday.

You would not believe how old I really am but my skin retains its youthful glow and elasticity and my posture and energy level is that of a much younger person. I feel at least half my age if not less. I would not even dare tell people my real age since they would laugh, thinking I am joking. Not that there is anything wrong with growing older - but if you can stay young gracefully, why not?",1145491200,11,681,4.044444444444444
2438272,5,B000BR4UQC,"This practice is wonderful.  Ravi & Anas special style of yoga is a welcome change from the other yoga DVDs I had been doing.  It is refreshingly to the point. Other yoga systems always seem to be a preparation for something but you never seem to find out what you are prepping for!

In this DVD you work on individual chakras thru a combination of poses and moving exercises with breathing. This is great for busy people since you can break it up into at least 6 or 7 segments. It is also nice to do the whole thing. When I am short on time I will either work the lower chakras (30 minutes for all 3) or the upper (same amount of time). There are also some meditative techniques designed to open the chakras which are very interesting. Sort of like the kind of thing you would climb a mountain to learn in a secret monastery in the Himalayas.

If you have not tried Ravi Ana Yoga yet, I would recommend starting with Beginners & Beyond. If you like it, try this. I alternate both along with their Fat Free & Navel Power. I have recently stopped going to the gym. I feel that this is all I need now.",1145491200,17,1099,4.194312796208531

In my opinion it is the best of what yoga is. I love that it is accesible to everyone. They get right into the workout which is brilliant.  No headstands either or boring, static, holding poses.  You move and stretch and breathe continuously with little rests in between exercises.

I absolutely love Ana & Ravi - they are so upbeat & happy. By the time I am done with one of their workouts so am I!

I love the victory dance's Ana does at the end of their workouts - it makes me laugh!

A wonderful tool to grow into your practice.

I will also say I have been doing Yoga for five years and this workout works out areas of my body I never knew I had!

Of Course, there is throughout, loads of information about the fascinating chakra subject. I have had lots of fun figuring out my blocks (but I'll never tell!)

This one keeps you throroughly engaged as you work the way up the body. 1st Chakra includes grounding exercises(standing poses) and working the legs, 2nd Chakra is lots of hip opening, 3rd Chakra is ab work. The 4th Chakra works the heart center and upper body, and so on. You get a wonderful lymphatic flush  in the process (I feel it is this flush that is giving my skin a new glow and many comments). The whole time you are gaining a wealth of information and insight about this fascinating subject. Things you don't hear elsewhere. Before you know it you have gotten a full body workout that has worked you on so many levels you may never be satisfied with any one dimensional fitness regime again!  Journey Through the Chakras goes thru each of the eight chakras (8th is Aura -radiance and charisma) using exercises which include postures combined with breath techniques.

Every single program of theirs was really highly rated.  When I saw that one reviewer,  had written ""the next day I woke up with someone else's back!"" (this was for Beginners & Beyond which I also highly recommend), that was all I needed to hear. Their DVDs are so good for back problems.  My back is coming alive after sleeping for so many years!  I have had unsuccessful back surgery & was on heavy narcotic pain meds for several years.  I have tried several yoga DVD programs specifically for back care in the past, but they have been boring & ineffective.

Please keep them coming Ana & Ravi. Your DVDs are a real gift for the walking wounded!",1143417600,12,876,4.166666666666667
2438286,5,B000BR4UQC,"I wish to convey my sincere gratitude to Ravi & Ana for their wonderful DVDs. I am a massage therapist from Boulder ,Co and I have been doing their routines for three years now and feel like a new person. My back and hips, former trouble spots from all the bending over I do in my  work, have been transformed. I can also now sit crosslegged on the floor without being in agony!

Caregivers like myself need to do work on the navel to stay centered and I especially like the work on the 3rd center for this. By the way, this is very well chaptered so you can work on what you most need to (you will discover your own blocks along the way) or do the entire thing.

I do this Chakra workout 1x a week on Sundays to get a good workout and keep me in a good place.

It may sound odd to some to work on the Chakras but all I can say is that it works! I always feel fantastic after this workout no matter what I may be going thorugh in the rest of my life!

The rest of the week I alternate their other works.

I find Ravi & Anas brand of yoga very effective and empowering.",1143331200,13,1068,3.944186046511628
2438287,5,B000BR4UQC,"This is my favorite of all my Yoga DVDs. I really enjoy the way this routine, works up through the energy centers in the body from the ground up. The moves are simple but effective and designed so everyone can participate no matter what their level.

Stretches are held long enough to get a good release and this DVD  presents a whole workout unlike many of my other yoga DVDs which leave me feeling like I still need ab work or cardio afterwards( somehow all the breathing on this combined with the moves makes me feel like I just spent a half hour hiking in Colorado ).

I love the Aura section (the 8th chakra). There are simple but invigorating exercises to cleanse the aura of negativity and make us more radiant.

No matter how utterly fatigued I am before I begin this workout it always brings me back to a good place mentally and physically.",1143331200,11,849,4.423076923076923
2438288,5,B000BR4UQC,"I am a certified Pilates instructor, practicing yoga enthusiast, and former dancer...I recently purchased a few of Ana & Ravi's dvds from Amazon.com out of pure curiosity and the desire to learn something new.  I am amazed by the way I feel after only 30 minutes of this style of yoga...all of the knots in my stomach, neck and shoulders just melt away! Thank you!",1143244800,7,364,4.6
2438289,5,B000BR4UQC,"I have fallen in love with Ana & Ravi. I took a workshop with them in Glen Rock ,NJ which was the best class I ever took and then bought 6 of their DVDs during the next week. There is nothing like this style of yoga.

This particular workout is to balance the chakras ie, the energy centers along the spine which are like colors on the spectrum.

Each Chakra on this DVD has its own section. In addition, its easy to break this tape in half and do either the first or second half only.

Its a little challenging for me though all the poses are doable( except the camel in which I do the modification given). I like the way they do tree pose, it is an interesting variation, also their version of crow pose is totally novel.

This is truly a spiritual awakening. I recommend that everyone do this at least once a week if not more. What a great Yoga practice. I can't live without it. It has truly restored my life!",1141862400,33,913,4.170454545454546
2438290,5,B000BR4UQC,"This DVD is wonderful in that is is a full workout which covers all the basic movements for Kundalini Yoga and gives the satisfaction of working on all the chakras. By opening up all of the chakra centers, the body has the chance to really open and get the benefits.

Ravi Singh and Ana Brett's explanations of the impact of opening the chakra centers and Ana Bretts perfect demonstration of the poses also sheds new light mentally and physically and allows the mind to soften and relax into the body changes which are very fluid.

This DVD is seamless. They show the basic movements but give depth and meaning in the explanation. You will gain strength and flexibility while becoming more peaceful and energized.

The Chakra work is fundamental to every yogi's practice whether you are a beginner or an intermediate to advanced practicioner.",1141776000,19,842,4.833333333333333
2438291,5,B000BR4UQC,"I am a Hatha yoga teacher who just took a workshop with Ravi & Ana in PA. It was the best workshop I ever took and I purchased their Chakra DVD so I could do parts of it in my own classes and workshops.

The Chakras are a fascinating subject, one my students and I can't get enough of. The Chakras are divided into 7 categories. Each chakra represents not only particular parts of your physical body, but also particular parts of your consciousness. There is also an important nerve plexi and an important gland in the exact same location as each chakra.

Where you feel stress in the body depends upon why you feel stress. Over time if the energy stays blocked in a particular chakra area. A symptom or symptoms will develop. You will feel it physically and in your consciousness.

Ravi & Anas method makes it fun and easy to explore where your own blocks are and how to clear them using yoga poses combined with movement and breath work.  This DVD is also a great workout for those are just into the physical side of yoga.  This workout helps me to feel integrated and whole.  When you do this DVD you will experience what all the buzz is about regarding chakras.",1141776000,13,1165,4.395348837209302

8091218,4,B000BR4UQC,"Super hesitant on this review. If you are a hardcore kundalini yogi, this DVD will make you laugh a bit and you probably won't enjoy it as much.
However this is a great start for someone who doesn't have time or just getting introduced to kundalini yoga.",1492473600,,254,4.425531914893617

8091222,2,B000BR4UQC,"I wanted to like this whole process. The chanting I catch myself doing throughout my day to calm and steady myself as well as my breathing. However, the ""breath of fire"" is a sort of hyperventilation which cause my limbs to atrophy! The good feeling when finished is a toss up between the pain and stress or the strenuous activity and hyperventilation being over or maybe through these odd pains the chakras truly are opened. Maybe you are closer to God by whipping yourself. I think something less ridiculous would be better, but that is my personal opinion.",1464220800,,559,4.714285714285714
