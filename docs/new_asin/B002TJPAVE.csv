3984956,5,B002TJPAVE,"Writer/director, John Albo, ushers you into a kinky and forbidden world alive with strange yet fascinating characters: a crazed end-of-days nun; a sexy dominatrix who plays perverse sex games with Monty; a wacko grandma horny for her grandson.  If you enter this world, leave your prudishness at the door.  Its a fun journey.  Youll have a great time.",1437868800,3,351,5.017241379310345
3984957,5,B002TJPAVE,"Incest, homophobia, and the cult of body worship are some of the themes covered in this brilliant film, which youll either love or hate, but never be indifferent to.  Albo is a visionary filmmaker.  Trevor Goddard gives a sensational performance as Monty.",1437782400,,255,5.0476190476190474
3984958,5,B002TJPAVE,"Flexing with Monty is seductive in its dark and mystifying beauty.  Writer/director John Albo weaves a surreal and nightmarish web with images that are bold and audacious.  Trust me, once youve seen this film, it will leave a lasting impression.  Trevor Goddard is unforgettable as Monty.",1437782400,,288,5.217391304347826
3984959,5,B002TJPAVE,"Shocking, visionary, Flexing with Monty casts an hallucinatory spell.  Its like a drug that induces an out-of-body experience  weirdly transcendent.  Id like to crawl inside Albos head and see what makes him tick.  I will look at this film many more times  thats how addictive it is.",1437609600,,283,4.9361702127659575
3984960,5,B002TJPAVE,Flexing with Monty is darkly funny and entirely mesmerizing.  I was completely riveted by the strange world John Albo created.  This is a powerful and unique film.  Do yourself a favor  check this film out.,1437609600,,206,4.8
3984961,2,B002TJPAVE,"I found this DVD for a quater at a garage sale. The previous owner told me it was an art film in the tradition of the Warhol-Morrissey experimental fliks of the 60s. Well how retro can you get? Well, maybe a tad too much.

The most interesting thing about this DVD is in the Extras. The Interview.  The director turns out to be a gentleman of a certain age in full Film Director regalia wearing his white hair pulled back in a pony tail. He punctuates every sentence with the word Man, just like the easy riders of many moons ago. All thats missing is the joint and the beer can. He is ostensibly being interviewed (probably by one of his crew members) and is asked how he got the idea for this film that took him 14 years to complete. Stressing several times that it was all shot on 35mm and not on HD Video (heaven forbid!) He goes on a rambling account of meeting some bodybuilder years ago who was obsessed with his body. Yes, a director accusing someone else of being self-absorbed. He had to make a film about such a person. Well, what must have started out as a cautionary tale has ended up as nothing more than a muscle worship video that looks like it was shot in one afternoon in an abandoned warehouse with the late Trevor Goddard as its centerpiece (just like Dallesandro in the Warhol shorts). The camera lovingly explores every inch of his musculature from every conceivable angle, though mostly from the floor up, in ecstatic adoration. The actor happily obliges, posing, flexing and swivelling his hips in the best go-go boy tradition. He dons gym bunny drag, cowboy drag and leather drag (apparently there was no time for sailor boy drag or fireman hunk drag). The young actor playing his crabby and/or loving brother is photographed to appear almost angelic, particularly when, as he sleeps, his older brother pulls down (for no apparent reason) his bed sheets to reveal an unblemished-by-pimples tush. Unfortunately for them, the females don't fare so good. The actresses are photographed to appear ultra grotesque, being the films recipients of the worst camera angles and unflattering lighting possible.

I guess because the film took so long to complete, what must have been a simple idea for a short film morphed into a slow and long mini-opus stuffed with everything of shock value you can think of. Theres incest, s&m, nudity, rubber dolls, homophobia, homoeroticism, fraticide, obliging hookers, repressed and crazy nuns (are there any other kind in the movies?). In other words, the proverbial kitchen sink syndrome.

Oh, yes, this is all reminiscent of Warhol & Co., but thats the problem. Those guys explored this territory decades ago, when these things were really shocking. But in the age of You-Tube and smartphones, any jaded kid of twelve surfing the web for cheap thrills would find this film quite tame. At one point in The Interview someone asks if this film might be sent to the pope thus causing general & gleeful merriment. As if. These guys don't seem to be aware that those queens in the curia would probably find Trevor Goddard too old for them.

This DVD is recommended only to devoted fans of Mr Goddard, lovers of sweaty muscles and people who collect esoterica-at-any-cost. A snooze for everyone else.",1414281600,,3249,4.743362831858407
3984962,5,B002TJPAVE,"This film doesn't deserve five stars, but it doesn't deserve only ONE either. This isn't Scorsese and the big name hype only adds to people expecting more than they should. You need to just go into this flick with a clear head, but maybe keep in mind that the words ""outrageous"", ""subversive"" and ""off-the-wall"" are used in the synopsis and that this isn't on a big Hollywood budget. I'm a huge fan of weird films and I'm GLADLY adding this to my collection and will probably watch again many times in the future. It's funny, surreal and in some parts, visually beautiful. You just need to get off your high horse and give it a chance.",1387411200,4,635,4.482758620689655
3984963,1,B002TJPAVE,"It's my new record. Officially. I stopped watching the film after first 13 minutes...I just couldn't listen any more to these stupid and quasi-theatrical monologues and dialogues.
It is really beyond my comprehension how anyone could create such horrible thing...
All copies of this ""masterpiece"" should be burnt!",1309910400,,313,5.541666666666667
3984964,1,B002TJPAVE,I wish I could rate this as 0 stars. Giving it a 1 is being too kind. I think the description provided under the product details does not accurately reflect what you see in this film.,1271980800,4,183,4.111111111111111
3984965,1,B002TJPAVE,"have you ever tried to lay an egg in a swamp?""  This is asked by a nun after a nude bodybuilder bends over and farts at her.  This  moment is topped when a stark-naked Sally Kirkland compares her breasts to ""bobbing, blood-shot eyes.""  Interested yet?  No?  How about watching a scene in which a nude man masturbates in a bird cage?  Good grief. As one reviewer noted, this is an original film.  And in truth, I've never seen anything like it. And hope not to again.  Ridiculous and tedious in every way imaginable, this is an unmitigated mess. I can easily believe it took years to make.  The director and producers must have been turning in soda bottles for nickels because I can't imagine anyone would want to finance this with his own money.",1264550400,18,745,4.492537313432836
3984966,3,B002TJPAVE,Definitely an art film with a message. Something I'd expect to see in a high school cinema class.,1456876800,,97,4.444444444444445

3984968,5,B002TJPAVE,A very exciting and interesting film.  I enjoyed it.  Alot of twists and turns.,1448841600,,79,4.571428571428571
3984969,5,B002TJPAVE,"This is one of the most subversive films Ive ever seen. Like David Lynch, Albo is not afraid to plum the depths of the unconscious mind and reveal to us the grotesqueries lurking in the darkest side of human nature. This film is one of a kind  freakish yet fascinating.",1448755200,,269,4.38

3984973,5,B002TJPAVE,"When I read that John Albos film, Flexing with Monty, was chosen as one of the 25 weirdest films of all time, right up there on the list with David Lynchs Eraser Head, and Peter Jacksons Heavenly Creatures, I just had to see it. Surreal. Shocking. Twisted. Demented, even. And funny.  Yes, Flexing with Monty is a weird film, but the best kind of weird film: a cult classic.  Maybe we need a bit more of Albo's kind of weird.",1447113600,,425,4.3
3984974,5,B002TJPAVE,"Flexing with Monty is full of surprises.  Some scenes are shocking and other scenes hysterically funny.  It's like getting lost in a demented funhouse.  You never know what you're going gto encounter next, but that the fun of it.  Trevor Goddard gives an award-winning performance as Monty and John Albo's direction is fiercely imaginative.",1447113600,,340,5.2407407407407405
3984975,1,B002TJPAVE,"Can I give it less than 1 star?  I have no idea what the hell I just watched.  It started interesting, gets weird and twisted, which some people like.  Then, it manages it get BORING!!!!",1447113600,,186,4.257142857142857

3984977,5,B002TJPAVE,"After seeing John Albo's film, Flexing with Monty, I remembered a quote by Edgar Allan Poe.  It referred to the realm of the grotesque:  a genre with ""much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust.""  Poe's quote best describes Flexing with Monty, an unusual and involving film.",1446854400,,380,4.7272727272727275

3984979,1,B002TJPAVE,"This movie was so bad I was compelled to watch it to the end to see how much worse it could be.  If I could give minus 5 stars, I  would.  Made no sense at all.",1445644800,,160,3.388888888888889
3984980,1,B002TJPAVE,Stupid low budget. I don't know why they make these awful movies and put them on TV I think Amazon is embarrassing themselves with these low-budget gay movies you certainly are better ones out there,1445558400,,198,4.685714285714286
3984981,1,B002TJPAVE,"What the hell was this? i made it up until the last 5 minutes and finally said, that's it. I've watched a lot of foreign movies that were on the strange side but this american piece is just weird.",1445212800,,196,4.051282051282051
3984982,5,B002TJPAVE,Great art direction and amazing absurdist dark humor. Director John Albo is a genius.,1444867200,,85,5.142857142857143

3984985,5,B002TJPAVE,"Unless you have already seen this movie, you have never seen anything like it and you never will again. This is less a film and more a surrealistic painting in motion. It is very creepy, disturbing at all times, and you will leave exhausted and with more questions than answers. This movie will offend most people, but if you can get past that, It could be the most interesting film you ever watch.",1441065600,,398,4.465753424657534

8380204,3,B002TJPAVE,"I'm not even sure how to rate this.  I think it as one of the most awful and bizarre movies I have seen...I should give it a 1 star rating it was that bad to me...but it gets 5 stars because it actually got me hooked in to watch the whole movie!  So...3 stars overall.  I thought the actors were horrible...the scenes were very dark touching on many taboo subjects.

I think the best way for me to describe this movie is to compare it to a train wreck...you know you really shouldn't look...but you just can't help yourself but stare.

Would I watch it again...NO WAY!  But...no regrets seeing it..it was entertaining in the sense of that you shake your head and say ""oh no...they aren't going there...""",1493164800,,703,4.410852713178294
8380205,3,B002TJPAVE,"Not sure this is a ""gay"" film but it is artsy film at its esoteric penultimate.  I found the release date and completion dates interesting given the demise of the actor for the main character in 2003.  If you ever wondered what creativity would happen if a producer, writer and director dropped-acid while puffing away on beer-bongs, come view this film.  The film is an indulgence for muscle admirers and makes a commentary on the vain focus on body-image that fades with age and at death into blubbery, squishy mass of nothingness.  It also strikes at the machismo image of alpha male that procreates and abandons young and ignores the impact on the mother, then with aged wisdom swoops in to rescue the floundering youth.  Okay, maybe that's a stretch--basically, it's a film that is big on ""eye candy"" and payback.",1487721600,2,818,4.773049645390071
8380206,5,B002TJPAVE,Wow. This was one of the strangest movies have seen in some time.  Love how it was filmed. Watch with open mind..,1486166400,,113,4.136363636363637

8380209,5,B002TJPAVE,"Flexing with Monty is one-of-a-kind, a brilliant black comedy.  It hits all the right notes.  Trevor Goddard gives an awesome performance as Monty, the vain, homophobic body builder.  And John Albo is a fearless and dynamic writer-director.",1468281600,,240,5.4324324324324325
