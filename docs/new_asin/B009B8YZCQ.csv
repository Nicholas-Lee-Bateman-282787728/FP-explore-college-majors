5312956,5,B009B8YZCQ,"There were many things to appreciate in Why Stop Now. First, what fabulous casting! Jesse Eisenberg, Melissa Leo, and Tracy Morgan were very well matched. Tracy keeps it funny with his jokes, Jesse has his usual quirkiness to his character and Melissa is completely outrageous. Isiah Whitlock Jr. is a perfect companion for Tracy Morgan. They work so well together and are hilarious! While the story line is very serious, they make it comical while keeping it light. I do believe these issues should be taken very seriously, but Jesse handles it with grace and perseverance. There are so many funny and outrageous scenes that occur. My favorite being the drug purchase. Finally, I love the musical element of the story! Definitely a must see!!",1346112000,4,743,4.952
5312957,5,B009B8YZCQ,"The originality of the story really drew me in, and the performances were solid- Tracy Morgan in particular surprised me by being so good in a more serious role. But what really stood out was the situational comedy- I found myself enjoying scene after scene of unusual settings and well-written secondary characters. It was a great balance of levity against the serious issue of drug addiction.",1345680000,5,394,4.984848484848484
5312958,2,B009B8YZCQ,"The movie centers around Eli (Jesse Eisenberg) a piano prodigy who come from a broken family. He has one chance to escape his life and really be free of his family. However things quickly go wrong when he decided to help his mom buy drugs from a drug dealer Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).

For a film about drugs abuse it really rather tame. Even Tracy Morgan was subdued somehow. The film has its great points however and you see a micro back story of each character that Eli has come to interact with. This helps Eli see them has people and not just ""f ups"" has he calls them in the movie. I wish the film just had a little more. If so maybe it could have done better but for a rental I give it 2 stars",1345507200,,699,4.102189781021898
5312959,5,B009B8YZCQ,"A highly entertaining rollicking escapade. Full of funny moments, the film's strong cast (Tracy Morgan, Jessie Eisenberg, and Melissa Leo) really makes this a wild ride!",1344556800,4,169,5.538461538461538
5312960,4,B009B8YZCQ,"Social outcast and bad drinker Eli( Jesse Eisenberg) works as a stock boy but aspires to go to a prestigious arts college. His former teacher Dave (Neal Huff) has managed to arrange an audition for him. On the morning of the audition, Eli attempts to quickly straighten out a home life that has always teetered on disaster. His sister Nicole (Emma Rayne Lyle) talks to people through a foul mouthed sock puppet that needs to be laundered. His waitress mother (Melissa Leo) needs to go to rehab. However things don't go as planned.

Rehab won't accept Eli's mother Penny because her urine is currently clean and she doesn't have insurance. They suggest she do drugs to dirty up her urine. Eli aids and abets his mother on her quest. He runs into the likes of drug dealer ""Sprinkles"" (Tracy Morgan). At this point the comedy kicks into gear. Eli ends up as a translator between Sprinkles and his Spanish speaking connection.

The film has some comedy scenes, most notable when Tracy Morgan is involved, but for the most part it is a drama that involves people with some type of problem which can be argued that they center around Penny's addiction. It is not a dark comedy per se, the comedy is not about dark material.

Eli's attraction for Chloe (Sarah Ramos) didn't seem to be well developed. Tracy Morgan as a drug dealer and his sidekick Black (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) lacked credibility in those roles as they were comically written while the other characters were more serious. It is a feel good movie, but not one that will make you hold your side with laughter.

5312962,5,B009B8YZCQ,"What a delight. I just happened upon this move I never even heard of. A very serious subject matter filled with outrageous laughter. Eisenberg and Morgan's performance was wonderful. Had to purchase this movie for my collection. I don't often by comedy, but this was a must have.  I looked at other venues to purchase this movie but the prices were still pretty high since it's release. then I order this from got2mojos NEW on AMAZON, however, it did not come NEW, that was very, very disappointing. I would have liked to have gotten what I paid for and would have probably purchased more as gifts for friends, that's how much I like this movie. Over all an excellent movie service getting the movie could have been better.

5312963,3,B009B8YZCQ,"Why Stop Now is mostly a comedy that begins on such a promising note before eventually falling apart.  I can't help but feel the writers missed the boat and didn't know how to wrap up the film with a satisfying conclusion.

When an expert piano player (played by Jesse Eisenberg) takes his mother to a drug rehabilitation center, it's discovered that his moms urine is unusually clean so... in order to be granted permission into the drug center, she has to come up with a way to get drugs into her system and taint her urine, lol.  That's pretty funny!  So, she gets Jesse involved in a drug obtaining scheme that initially involves wearing a disguise costume and pretending to be a drug addict himself looking for a quick fix, but this quickly turns into an entirely different matter as one offbeat situation after another develops, and the drug dealers discover they're being visited by Jesse for other reasons.

However, because Jesse knows the Spanish language, the drug dealers drag Jesse (and his mom) to a restaurant where a secret meeting with *other* drug dealers concerning high-priced drugs takes place.  The conversation we see here between Jesse and the drug dealers (the African American and the Spanish guy sitting at the table) is the best moment of writing in the entire movie for me.  Loved this scene!  Everything seems so promising up to this point until... well, eventually the storyline fizzles out.  The strength of this storyline clearly should have been on the drug dealers because the oddball and unrealistic relationship they develop with Jesse and his mother as they travel around town is easily the high point of the storytelling, however it all goes to waste shortly after this scene.

Jesse has a crush on a girl at school and through an unusual reenactment involving the Civil War, they get to know each other better with each segment.  This is honestly a pretty boring aspect of the film, and I see no reason why it should have even been included.  Also Jesse's younger sister has a puppet addiction, so much so that the teacher asks Jesse to make her stop and communicate with her classmates normally.  This is another ""Why is this even part of the story?"" moment.  Only when the drug dealers and the little girl have a little argument over the puppet does it reach a brief moment of being enticing.

At least Jesse's mom is believable in her drug addiction role, and Jesse's emotions when dropping her off at the drug rehab center are EXCELLENT!  Really strong, forceful and believable emotions revealing the frustration he's feeling that his mom won't quit taking drugs.  She's obviously reached a point of addiction that she needs to end it as soon as possible by any means necessary.  Still, there should have been more involvement with the drug dealers, Jesse and his mom.  The moments where Jesse's playing the piano during an audition and revealing his amazing talents are pretty good, but nothing great (except the one where he's bleeding- you'll see what I mean when (if) you watch Why Stop Now).  Another memorable part comes when Jesse calls his mom's sister pretentious because of the way she acts.  Shortly after this scene Jesse plays a really good song on the piano- loved the song he was playing but don't know the name of it.

I think Why Stop Now being so short is the biggest problem.  The storyline needed more time to fully develop and stretch out the comedy segments becaues as it stands, it feels severely lacking.  Not a bad film though.  Worth 80 minutes of your time.",1370995200,2,3528,4.744262295081967
5312964,2,B009B8YZCQ,"why in the world did an excellent actor such as Jesse Eisenberg let himself get roped into making this DUMB movie or did he owe someone a favor? Jessie has a great shot at going to a great college on a scholarship if he can only do well at an audition. This kid has more obstacles in his way than John Wayne fighting off a tribe of Indians. His mother is a druggie and his friends are all well in the sale of drugs. I kept saying to myself, get out of that situation and away from all those dregs that are holding you down and get to the audition. Like I said, this is dumb humor.......Hollywood is certainly getting Dumb and Dumber",1369180800,,632,4.146341463414634

Tracy Morgan was hilarious as always and the writing was wonderfful with some really funny scenes. I'm surprised it didn't get more attention. Also, the audition piece Eisenberg's character plays (he has an audition for a prestigious music school which almost gets away from him due to the all the crazy events in the film) is beautiful. I wasn't able to find it on iTunes when I first saw the movie last summer, but just found out it was now available (and I just bought it).

5312968,5,B009B8YZCQ,"Note: May contain Spoilers. Proceed witch caution.

Why stop Now is one of those films that went completely under my radar. I didn't hear any talk about it, I saw no trailers leading up to its release, and I didn't even know it existed in theaters. When I saw the box at the video store I noticed that it had Jesse Eisenberg and Tracy Morgan in it. Now Jesse Eisenberg is easily on of my favorite actors to blow up in the last decade and Tracy Morgan is a fantastic comedian. The little description on the back honestly didn't look too appealing, but I figured why not? Let me tell you, that little description did not do this film justice.

The movie starts off towards the middle of the story and then we'll get a flashback to the night before. As the movie progresses, the viewer eventually reaches the point we started at and you continue on until it concludes. From start to finish I was fully engaged in this wonderful story. Not only was it deep, thought-provoking, and wonderfully written, but it had enough comedic elements to lighten the mood when things got to be a little too much.

In short, you follow one specific day in Eli Bloom's (Esienerg) life. Eli is a twenty-something year old (24?) piano player who has a pretty tough life at home. His mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), is a drug addict. Eli's plan is to get her to rehab so he can drive out to Boston and be on time for his piano audition. Unfortunately, because Penny has been sober for a few days and she has no insurance, the clinic says they are unable to take her unless she comes in with ""dirty"" urine.

When Penny tells this to Eli he, out of desperation, tells her that he will take her to get drugs from her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan), and he'll even pay for them himself. Getting the drugs, however, proves to be more difficult than anticipated when Eli finds out that Sprinkles is out and he has to re-up. Eli, still desperate, tells Sprinkles that he'll take him to the Spanish drug dealer and be his translator.

This is just the main story that sets up an entirely different set of side-stories that show just how beautiful this film really is. In essence, the film is not only about drug addiction, but about music as a form of escape. During a deep one-on-one with Sprinkles, Eli admits that he loves playing the piano so much because it ""makes [him] feel invisible."" For any musician out there that one line will hit home. So many people in the world talk about how they're ""addicted"" to music, but not many truly know what that means until they use it as a way to escape from the harsh realities of their life.

Thankfully, the casting in the film is just as enjoyable as the writing. Jesse Eisenberg, once again, gives a fantastic performance as this troubled piano player. Every time I see him in a new role I see just how much he's progressed as an actor. Tracy Morgan gave an equally enjoyable performance as Sprinkles. For this role Tracy Morgan dipped his toes a little in the dramatic side of things and he pulled it off beautifully. I know he's a comedian, but this has to be my favorite role I've seen from him so far. Melissa Leo's performance was great as well. The costume department did a wonderful job at creating this drug-addicted, emotionally troubled woman and Leo came through and hit the nail on the coffin with her performance. Finally, you have Isaiah Whitlock, Jr. who plays Black, Sprinkles' companion. Now Black doesn't have a terrible amount of dialogue, but every line he said, he delivered. The best one was about how parent's are so afraid to discipline their children nowadays. I don't remember it word for word, but it was spot on.

Overall Score: 9/10 - I wasn't sure what to expect when I popped the disc in, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The story was wonderful, the acting was spot on, and whoever wrote the score did a fantastic job. From start to finish this is an emotional ride that's bound to pluck at a few strings for those who know someone who's a drug addict or those who use music as a way to escape. Definitely recommend you watch this if you're in the mood for a good dramatic comedy.",1360368000,4,4159,4.464473684210526

5312971,2,B009B8YZCQ,"This was an overall annoying movie with everyone talking over one another most of the time. I guess that was their attempt at making it more realistic?

I thought I would be cracking up the whole time based on the trailer but it was not what I would call a comedy. Rather, it was a drama with a couple of awkwardly funny moments. A waste of time. If you're in the mood for something cute, I just watched Ruby Sparks and would give that 4-5 stars.",1356998400,,446,4.186046511627907

5312974,2,B009B8YZCQ,"""Why Stop Now"" is a comedy-drama in which a simple trip to an audition becomes a life-changing adventure.  Piano prodigy Eli Bloom (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to the most important audition of his life, but first he has to drop off his mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), at a drug rehab center.

Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted, mother and son end up at the door of her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).  Since Penny is in debt and Sprinkles is low on product, Eli must play negotiator as the unlikely team hits the streets.  A series of comic misadventures ensues, perhaps too many to make the events even passably possible.  The cast is in top form, however, though each of the principals has been showcased far better in other projects.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette, interview with Tracy Morgan, and theatrical trailer.",1355961600,,879,4.75
5312975,5,B009B8YZCQ,"Pretty much everything.  Comedies these days tend to rely mainly on cheap tricks and superficial gimmicks, rather than truth.  True conflicts that resonate in the human heart.  True tragedies that are seen daily.  True humor that needs no crutches in profanity (even if it doesn't shy away from using it) but stands on its own based in human nature and solid acting.

Why stop now?  Because this review has said everything you need to know.

He has an audition to get into an elite music school, he wants his mother (Leo) to get into rehab so she can take care of his sister without him worrying. Once she is out and sober he can leave and not worry. They only problem is that his mom's test came back clean, so they need to get her high in order for her to get into rehab...sounds easy. First off this movie is not bad and it is a comedy, but not really a laugh out loud comedy. The idea itself is pretty funny and the writing is pretty clever. Jesse Eisenberg is turning into an actor who plays the same character over and over, but he is good at playing this type of kid. The movie overall is nothing special but it is entertaining and if you are looking for a mindless movie to put in and enjoy then this is a decent choice. Overall, nothing special but still a pretty good comedy that is entertaining. I give it a B.",1354492800,2,993,4.0456852791878175
5312977,3,B009B8YZCQ,I had never heard of this movie before but saw it was a comedy and starred the guy from the face book movie and Tracy Morgan from 30 Rock so I gave it a try. The movie follows the lead through a couple of strange days with his mother and a couple of other characters. Without spoiling I thought that there was several unnecessary scenes in the movie that really had no place in a comedy and a terrible conclusion.  While some parts of the movie were somewhat funny it seemed like there was a lot of filler material that lost both mine and my husband's interest. Overall it was not a bad film it just seemed like they could have taken advantage of a good cast with more humor or provocative drama.
