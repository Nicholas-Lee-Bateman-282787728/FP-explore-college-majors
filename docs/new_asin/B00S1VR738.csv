8697011,3,B00S1VR738,"This is a good account and a solid overview of the Vietnam War. Mostly comprised of still images, narrative voice overs, and interviews with Vietnam War Veterans. I was hoping to see more emotion and video footage. There's some popular segments I've seen before in other documentaries and footage libraries that's missing in this series, but this set is highly recommended if you're doing a school paper on the subject.",1427328000,17,419,5.0
