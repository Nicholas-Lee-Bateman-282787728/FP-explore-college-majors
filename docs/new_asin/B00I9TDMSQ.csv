The movie has slow spots to the story line, but otherwise is a very moving story.",1479340800,,250,4.122448979591836

8640247,5,B00I9TDMSQ,"The heart warming tale opens with an old cagy Hal Holbrook wanting to see the circus. He is befriended by the current staff and tells them his story. As a young man during the depression, Robert Patterson hits the road due to tragedy and inadvertently joins the circus. He has veterinary skills and an eye for Reese Witherspoon who is married to circus boss Christopher Waltz. She is the bareback rider and is pictured on the DVD in the arms of Patterson. Not hard to figure out where this is going. From the beginning dialouge we know there will be a tragedy and Robert Patterson will survive and mature into an actor as fine as Hal Holbrook.

Heart throb Robert Patterson is a slightly better caliber actor in this one than what we have seen in ""Twilight."" The movie is more than a love story, it is also a PETA commercial for the abuse of circus animals in the name of the almighty dollar. Christopher Waltz plays an excellent jealous insecure ""bad guy."" Reese Witherspoon was not the perky blond we are used to seeing. She appears to be miscast in the role and doesn't look natural with the 30's hair style. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't bad, they just didn't write lines for her. 5 stars for those who enjoy an old fashion forbidden romance with an elephant.

No f-bombs. Violence to animals and women, quick love scene, brief 30's style French postcard type nudity, Robert Patterson's acting.",1436140800,,1399,4.592
