German and Jap POWS at McCoy were depicted as free to roam the grounds, which I strongly suspect is a misinterpretation.  Sex innuendos and asides were entirely unnecessary and trite.

Give it a watch! By the way Fort McCoy turns out to be single example of a Allied WWII prisoner of war program. It turns out by the end of the war there were about 425,000 POWs interned at camps in almost every state. Wikipedia: bit.ly/1y7nKGR",1428192000,,577,4.611650485436893

6481970,4,B00LFN014G,"This drama shows the American home front from an unusual point of view.  The acting and dialogue are excellent, though quiet.  Eric Stoltz brilliantly takes on the manner & body language of the era.  The sister portrays the excitement of a first love that takes hold.  The movie is neither cynical nor ironic, and a contemporary viewer might keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.  It never does - with one exception, these are all good people.  A heavily-implied instance of ongoing pedophilia involving two supporting characters (followed by a likely murder made to look like suicide) is disturbing.  It may trouble children and even teenagers.  At the end of the film, captions tell what happened to the real life family after the war.

During the 1980s and then in the early 1990s, I was at Fort McCoy with the army.  At the time, the World War II post was largely intact and remnants of the POWs remained visible.  Although partly shot on location, the film doesn't show a lot of the post and is, surprisingly, not evocative in that way.  That was a disappointment specific to me, but it doesn't mar a very good film.",1422316800,,1124,4.649746192893401

Much of the filming was done in WI:  Norskedalen, Fort McCoy,  and a local Boy Scout camp.  The rest was filmed in CA.  I had heard stories similar to these from some of the older generation in this area and my mom's family had a family who lived with them during this timeframe because the father was stationed there.  They stayed friends with my grandparents for years.  My mom had just been born when they first came, but remembers them from later years.

Other venues included the currently being restored Hollywood Theater in La Crosse, Wisconsin; Camp Decorah, in Holmen, Wisconsin; the Skogdalen Church, Westby Wisconsin. The historic site called Norskedalen was transformed to suit the 1930s back drop, complete with the prairie grasses shown on the dvd sleeve and the dog, a red Lab named Killer and Addey used in the film.

The Sam/Anna love story was a rather irritating subplot:  Sam is an irritating character the viewer hopes would fade from view early in the movie to make way for the more interesting aspects of the film such as the intereaction between Gertie and the young German POW.  Instead, the opposite happened.  No real closure on the dreadful concomitants of war is achieved.

6481988,4,B00LFN014G,"3 1/2 TO 4 STARS --- FOR A WONDERFUL, WORTHY, BUT SMALL BUDGET, DRAMA OF A FAMILY LIVING NEXT TO A P.O.W. CAMP (WISCONSIN) DURING WWII  -- CAN BE A LITTLE SACCHARIN ON ONE HAND AND INTERSPERESED WITH HEAVY MATERIAL ON THE OTHER

THE PLOT: Somewhat slow moving but generally true story of Frank Stern (Erick Stoltz) who is a German American not allowed to fight in WWII because of a heart murmur.  He moves his family to FT, McCoy Wisconsin next to a prisoner of war camp so he can make a small contribution to the war effort acting as the post barber for both soldiers and prisoners.  Accompanying the family is his wife's sister Anna Gerkey (Lyndsy Fonseca, Nikita TV series) who has recently graduated high school.  The camp houses both German and Japanese prisoners, many of whom have a surprising amount of freedom to move around.  The movie is narrated from the perspective of Frank's young daughter who befriends a young German boy interred at the camp.  Many conflicts arise as a troublesome SS officer threatens Franks family by his presence in their house one night.  A Japanese soldier also tries to retain his honor as he attempts to force a guard to kill him just outside the Stern family home.  Eventually a fence is erected to protect the family from prisoners and there are little nuances of who is the real prisoner.  Frank also struggles with bigotry for his German heritage and hides the fact he speaks German, even from his children.  Other social issues arise as teenage Anna falls in love with a returned Jewish/American soldier, though she is Catholic.

MOVIE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:  There are certainly some viewers who found this movie too slow for their tastes and that view is valid.  I recommend not judging the movie too harshly since life is not always as fast paced and dramatic as Hollywood and this is a mainly real life account.  What they accomplish in this movie, and it's important topics, will be engaging for many viewers.  The acting and production values are quite strong in the context of a small budget.  It is certainly better than made for tv, but only a little more so.  The acting can feel just a little stiff occasionally as they attempt to recreate the manners and way-of-speech during the 1940's.  The adults are often speaking to children so of course the tone can be light.  Mostly it's realistic for that time period.  Despite the saccharin feel, certain events are quite heavy, though we don't see everything as it happens and events are inferred. As friends go off to war and die, or prison stuff happens, the children will find their innocence lost.

Enjoy a view of the war we don't always see in cinema.  Most people with an interest in this genre will find this film worth while.  I believe I have given enough information to those who won't to make that decision as well.  Regardless, I recommend a rental rather than purchase sight unseen.  Most of the film is family friendly, but if you are showing to young children you will have to decide how much you are willing to explain and if that's appropriate.  Includes scenes of fighting, inferred sexual contact including pedophilia.  If you are warned off by that last mention, realize that it is not the point of the movie and an ancillary (though important) occurrence in what is after all a true story.",1414281600,9,3317,4.672413793103448

I can't help but think with him being of American ,German decent had he been raised in Germany he would have felt the same and would have  wanted to fight for his country . Although he was far from a Nazi sympathizer . This movie showed a young girls human compassion for the German boy , who we all wanted to hate but couldn't . Then there was forbidden love of a young couple faced with religious obstacles .Of course the evils of war was the Nazi officer who showed no compassion for human life and in his world he would snuff out what ever soul you had left and kill you .Clearly making this something to think about and how sad war really is .
