8648117,3,B00J4LMLOE,Bought this DVD to see Topher Grace.  Big fan.  He has maybe 1 to 2 minutes on the screen.  It took me a while to get into this movie.  Not a movie I would care to see again.  Entertaining in some places.  But mostly just a disorganized mess.,1518912000,,242,3.9375

8648122,5,B00J4LMLOE,A brilliant and whimsical hallucinatory journey of discovery and self-realization for a young man disturbed by the pressures and hard realities of life and adult responsibilities. Drift with it; float with it; suspend your disbelief and absorb the lessons that it eventually teaches all of us.,1410739200,,293,5.391304347826087
