7862036,5,6304124953,"What you see on the tape clearly differs from the book. I will note tape>Book

Tape: Elizabeth works at hospital, Jessica is interested>Book: Jessica's friend Cara walker tells Jessica about Jeremy Frank, THEN Jessica volunteers Elizabeth to the hospital.
Tape: Jeremy endures disaster from Jessica>Book, very similar all the way around. However, the tape says that Jeremy was auditoning for a co-host for his show. Jeremy just had teenaged guest stars, not applying a co-host.
Tape: Todd thinks that Winston is sending things to Elizabeth. Book: No mention of anything was sent to Elizabeth to arise any suspicions.
Tape: Winston is a suspected kidnapper. Book: Max Dellon was suspected of being a kidnapper after looking inside Elizabeth's Fiat (not Jeep).
Tape: The suspect is named Peter. Book: The suspect is named Carl. The intern is of course mentally disturbed, no difference.
Tape: Elizabeth cuts herself free. Book: Upon arrest, carl told where Elizabeth was and Jessica led the police to her twin. Elizabeth was untied by the police.
Tape: Nicholas Morrow is holding a party and Jessica fears other girls are on the prowl. Book: Somewhat true, but Regina Morrow was never mentioned nor her hearing loss.  You dcn't see Mr. and Mrs. Morrow either, along with the Wakefields and Steven! You think if Elizabeth was being kidnapped, hello, involve her parents!
Tape: Jessica is kidnapped by Peter as he mistook her for Elizabeth. Book: I would've been glad to read that so that Jessica wouldn't have been so jealous of Elizabeth being Jeremy's guest star after the horrible ordeal.
Book: Tricia Martin is dying of leukemia, skipped for whatever reason.",1281398400,,1659,5.118081180811808

7862038,5,6304124953,"Sweet Valley High was one of the sharpest, most clever, and terribly underrated teen shows out there that unjustly got cancelled after four delightful seasons, and has not yet been released on DVD. While I wish the series would have concentrated more on serious issues, the tone of the series was light, fluffy, and fun with some seriousness thrown into the mix.
Kidnapped was one of the more serious, but ludicrous, storylines from Season 1, edited as one episode for this video release. The first episode is like any other of Sweet Valley High; cute and harmless. Elizabeth volunteers at the hospital, where a famous talk show host is a patient. This grabs her twin sister Jessica's interest and she tries to sneak in to meet the man and nab a job as his new co-host. In order to do that, she has to pretend to be Elizabeth, with humorous results. On a more serious note, while at the hospital, a quiet orderly, Peter, becomes fascinated by Elizabeth and begins sending her gifts as a secret admirer. This pisses off her boyfriend, Todd, who thinks his best friend, Winston, is the one sending the gifts because he and Elizabeth have grown so close. This causes a rivalry between the friends and, in the second episode, makes Winston a suspect when Peter kidnaps Elizabeth. The third episode, the most ridiculous of the three, finds Peter, who escaped from the police car at the end of episode 2, kidnapping Jessica, who he thinks is Elizabeth. Episode 2 also introduces Nick, a charming rich transfer student who grabs Jessica and Lila's attention, and unknowingly comes between Todd and Elizabeth in the season finale, setting up Season 2.
This is a fun video, but is definitely not the best of Season 1, which overall, is the best season of the series. The episodes are addicting, but rather far-fetched. The earlier episodes of the season are far superior and I can't wait till the seasons are released on DVD. It's long been delayed.",1090022400,,1940,4.742603550295858

Dangerous Love is three episodes from Season 2 brought together. It's the one where Jessica (a delicious Brittany Daniel, more gorgeous than ever in this show) falls in love with Motorcross racer Sam, and biggest rival to her twin siser's (the more innocent Cynthia Daniel) boyfriend, Todd Wilkins. Turns out Sam just got out of prison and her sister tries to get Jessica to back out of the relationship, but Jessica seems to understand Sam and ends up falling for him. There is also a storyline about Jessica's best friend, Lila, who has just been dumped by her personal trainer boyfriend and feels left out at Jessica's new romance, and tries different ways to make herself feel better, including her stalking of Liz and Todd. Meanwhile, Manny finally acts on his feelings for Enid, but keeps getting interrupted when he tries to ask her out. The final episode of the three has the students of SVH nervous about finding a prom date and Sam unsure of how to tell Jessica that he has accepted a job and has to leave Sweet Valley. When Jessica finds out, she has to take drastic measures to make sure he accepts, as much as it pains her to let him go.
This is a fun video, taken from some of Season 2's best episodes. It is recommended for any Sweet Valley fan, especially since we are unlucky not to have the fantastic shows 4 seasons on DVD yet. We can only hope...",1090022400,3,1627,4.5563139931740615
7862040,5,6304124953,This episode is about when Jess falls in love with some new guy in town called Sam. People including Liz don't approve of this romance and so on. I think this is every SVH fans dream come true. It even works in the UK on most vcr's. The quality is great and it even has some bonus features. I strongly recommend it to SVH lovers!!!,1017273600,5,331,4.107692307692307
