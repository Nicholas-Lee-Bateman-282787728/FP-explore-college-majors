2835031,4,B000Q7ZKZ2,"Ahh!  Those halcyon days of my youth return with the third volume of Hanna-Barbera's Godzilla cartoon from the late 1970s. It is such a treat to watch these again after so many years.  Though dated and corny and cheesy, if you want to watch something fun and entertaining, this is for you.  Highly recommended for all G-Fans everywhere.",1200614400,5,336,4.758620689655173
2835032,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,"As a 14 year old kid, I would highly recommend this DVD for the Godzilla fan in you or for someone else. This DVD includes five episodes from the original Godzilla cartoon from Cartoon Network. I've been a Godzilla fan since I was 5 and I still remember waking up early to watch Godzilla. Now that I'm older, I laugh every time the gang gets in trouble and all they do is push a button and Godzilla pops out from the ocean and saves them. I am kind of disappointed that there are no bonus features, but it's not bad for the price. Even though it's not the original Toho Godzilla, I think that you should still check it out.  -Steve Fong",1199232000,3,636,4.213114754098361
2835033,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,"I enjoyed this Cartoon when I was a Kid.  I did not care if it was a cheap cartoon.  I Loved Godzilla when I was a Kid and I still Love the Big Green Lizard.  I'm so glad Season one is now complete on DVD, and I'm hoping for the second season, they just release it as a set.",1190764800,2,274,3.610169491525424
2835034,4,B000Q7ZKZ2,"If you like the music in this show, and like DC Comics super heroes, buy this one, and also enjoy the Godzilla incidental music in Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians, being released late October.
This is the best version of Godzilla too. He's got laser vision, a cute sidekick dinosaur named Godzookie, and a team of ocean explorers in a ship ""The Calico"", who can summon Godzilla to their aid, with a signalling device.
The plots are intelligently written sci-fi, which I first enjoyed at age 10, and still enjoy in my 30s.
Buy all 3 volumes, and you'll have the season.",1190505600,7,574,4.637254901960785
2835035,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,"My kiddos already had seasons 1 & 2, so they were tickled pink to discover that yeah, the nonsense continued for a third season! It's typical of its era- this'll date me, but from the time of MY childhood- kinda cheesy. But, what can you expect? Anyhow, it's been a very satisfactory purchase for the kids. Highly recommended, if you have kids who are nuts for the whole Godzilla franchise. :o)",1285200000,4,394,4.563380281690141
2835036,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,"I recommend picking up all three of the volumes that have been released if you're a fan of the original cartoon or a Godzilla fan.  Unfortunately, the second season hasn't been released and there are no signs that it ever will be (shame on companies that do partial releases).  I hope that someone gets around to releasing the entire series soon!",1283040000,4,346,4.655737704918033
2835037,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,Well worth the money I say.  I am really enjoying being able to buy the DVDs of cartoons I grew up with.  Godzilla is a really cool series especially with it being centered around water with the Calico and it's crew.  Godzooky adds a nice humorous touch to the mix.  Highly recommended.,1279238400,,286,4.4423076923076925

only lasted few episodes, Godzilla is the man!

2835042,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,"This DVD is called ""Godzilla: The Original Animated Series Volume 3.""

This DVD contains 5 episodes of the 1970s Hanna Barbera Godzilla cartoon. They are:

Island Of Lost Ships - The Sirens, creatures from ancient greek mythology, sing their beautiful, hypnotic music, which causes Captain Majors to strand the Calico and its passengers on an island.

The Magnetic Terror - A giant turtle-like monster keeps getting bigger and bigger as it feeds on energy. Captain Majors and Brock are very brave in this one, as they are willing to sacrifice their lives in order to save the world from this monster.

The Breeder Beast - A giant slug-like creature threatens to cause a nuclear explosion and destroy the world.

The Sub-Zero Terror - The crew of the Calico discovers a group of abominable snowman-like creatures, plus another similar creature which is much larger.

The Time Dragons - Godzilla and the crew of the Calico travel back in time to when dinosaurs were still alive.

I love this show, and with this release and the 2 previous ones, all 13 episodes from the first season are now available on DVD. However, there was also a second season with 13 more episodes, and none of those are available on DVD. I hope they will be released, because I love this show and I would buy them. Season 2 has ""Calico Clones,"" which is my favorite episode of the series, as well as ""Microgodzilla"" and ""Island Of Doom,"" which are also among the best episodes of the series.",1224806400,16,1463,4.713725490196079
2835043,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,I remember watching this cartoon when I was young. I have always loved Godzilla and so I took this cartoon. As an adult I purchased this DVD (I have the previous 2 as well) knowing that it wasn't the best made cartoon but to relive some of the older cartoons that I did enjoy. If you have a young child that is into Godzilla and monsters then they will probably like this cartoon.,1210896000,2,380,4.219178082191781

8195204,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,"I loved this series as a kid although now it seems weird to hear Godzilla without his trademark roar.
That being said i have a theory as to why Season two will never be released. In one of the last episodes the Godzilla team faces off against a terrorist group called COBRA....Yeah! THAT Cobra!!! in fact i think we see Cobra commander and the Baroness in particular. (I remember later when I first got into GI Joe  that I remembered Cobra's existence prior to the introduction in GI joe)",1469145600,2,488,4.48314606741573

8195206,1,B000Q7ZKZ2,"If each episode is 30 minutes long and this entire DVD's run time is 90 minutes, why would I spend so much money on 3 episodes of a 70's - 80's  cheap cartoon. Seriously, the volumes 1 & 2 of the set were less than 5 bucks, why is volume 3 so incredibly high, it's not even Blu-Ray? Can anyone explain this?",1427500800,5,307,3.9516129032258065
8195207,5,B000Q7ZKZ2,I'm a fan of Hanna Barberra this show on DVD finishes the series. I enjoyed the music and the stories. If you remember the late 70s then you will like this dvd,1355270400,3,159,4.0
