5735353,5,B00CRFQUDW,This is a wonderful series and I thoroughly enjoy it....  I will watch it over and over again because the acting and the costumes are so  great.,1385337600,2,144,4.296296296296297
5735354,5,B00CRFQUDW,"Overall this is a great series, the plot lines and acting are fabulous.  There are some funny parts and some things that are far more taboo now than they were back then.  But this series has about as much basis in reality as a tabloid does.  I did some research and the real Borgia Pope had about 8 or 9 children, at least.  But, Lucrezia, Cesare, and Juan were his 3 favorites and they were by the same woman, Vanozza.  Aside from that and some other things like the fact that Cesare was a lot like his father and Juan was a wastrel, there isn't a lot fact in this series.

After the first season it appears that the writers didn't know where to go with it so they focused, primarily, on the evolution of Lucrezia.  She was one of the, if not the most well known of her siblings and she had the most potential for character development and growth.  They also focused on the relationship between Lucrezia, her various lovers, loves, and suitors, as well as her family.  They also focused on the characters who had the most potential for controversy, like Juan's self-destructive behavior and Cesare becoming more like his father in some ways, but with different personal ambitions.  In other ways Cesare doesn't allow himself to become like his father.  That is because he has seen how many enemies being like his father will and have gained him.

Overall, this is a GREAT SERIES WORTH WATCHING!  I DO NOT RECCOMMEND IT TO CHILDREN!  There is some minor graphic nudity and sexually explicit scenes.  There is also a LOT of graphic VIOLENCE.",1378512000,40,1540,4.549090909090909
5735355,4,B00CRFQUDW,"I absolutely adore this series, but the season 2 disks have flaws. All but episodes 2 and 5 have white lines at the top of the screen. Season one has the same white lines on some of the menu screens, but they don't really bother me since they're just menu screens. Amazon sent a replacement set, but it has the same flaws in all of the disks too! Also beware, this is not a special boxed set of the three seasons. This is simply all three seasons shrink wrapped together. There's nothing different about them than the three sesasons that are sold sparately. In fact, at the time that I bought these, the separate seasons cost about $25 each, whereas this set cost over $100. I would have saved money if I'd ordered each season separately.",1378252800,50,738,4.4338235294117645
5735356,5,B00CRFQUDW,"The writers actually managed to stay very close to the true history; so very nice to see when so often historical dramas like this get embellished as if the real story wasn't interesting enough.
The costumes, sets and locations all enhanced the telling of this highly interesting family. The players all did an outstanding job of story telling through sensitive portrayals of these historical persons. As well, I liked the fact that the writers kept it all character driven.",1377734400,3,474,5.012658227848101
5735357,3,B00CRFQUDW,"The series is well played and well directed. It is a real pleasure to watch it. Unfortunately some moron at Showtime decided to use the most retarded menu I have ever seen on a DVD or a Blu-ray. Unless you watch a whole disk  in one shot, you will waste five minutes every time you sit down to watch. That is because it takes about four minutes to go through the showtime Pre-menu and get to the actual menu of the disc. And you have to do this every time. Absolutely retarded! Five stars for the serious and zero for the presentation.",1517270400,,535,4.245098039215686

5735370,3,B00CRFQUDW,"If the Roman Catholic Church needs negative advertising, this series is the way to go! It will certainly cure any interest anyone ever had in become a Roman Catholic. It presents the RCC and papacy in just about the worst possible light as corrupt, venal, carnal, and greedy.

Unless you are a real glutton for punishment, the series is way too long. Once you get started, it would be hard to stop, but I will certainly think twice before viewing it again.",1495843200,,456,4.560975609756097

5735376,4,B00CRFQUDW,"I'm a little late to the review party on this one. Many have been here before me with plot and character details, so I'll just leave a few remarks:

--For a ""complete series"" this is good price.
--May not be totally accurate, historically, but the character interaction and plot twists will keep you interested, and have you turning to Google to check on the facts ;>)
--Has convincing performances by the lead actors.
--Contains sex, violence, and some nudity, so be advised if you are a strictly PG kind of viewer.

Dive in, and you'll have several nights worth of entertaining drama.",1486944000,,586,4.735294117647059

5735378,5,B00CRFQUDW,"I have read several histories of the Borgias, including Christopher Hibbert's book, and although this series is not 100% historically correct it is more than worthy of attention.  The writing, which I regard as primary to all good productions, is superlative and the cast is outstanding.  In the past I have enjoyed other series such as ""DeadWood"" (David Milch) and ""Boston Legal"" (David E. Kelley).  These shows depend on great writing as the crux of their success.  I only wish ""The Borgias"" had not been cancelled after the third season, like ""Deadwood"".  Historically there is much more, and Cardinal Delle Rovere, who is Rodrigo Borgia's, a.k.a. Pope Alexander VI, nemesis, becomes the next Pontiff...Pope Julius II.",1486080000,4,721,5.181034482758621

5735388,4,B00CRFQUDW,"I like period piece series. I so enjoyed The Tudors that I bought The Borgias. It is enjoyable; the costumes, scenery, and music are first rate. But what the H happened to the writing?! One character constantly refers to his sibling as ""sis"". There are many others and it is jarring. One minute you're in the vivid, pulsating past and the next you've jumped hundreds of years to modernity. Such a shame. I think that the acting is pretty lame as well. Rodrigo Borgia was a dangerous dude and an olympic class schemer. But Jeremy Irons plays him like a kid on the short bus. His standard facial expression is one of befuddlement. He seems totally dependent on his son. This character could never have caused the chaos of the real person. So close but so not there!",1479168000,,763,4.536231884057971

5735396,2,B00CRFQUDW,"As much as I love the history, the setting and costumes...so much of this is gratuitous sex and violence.  I don't doubt it happened, exactly, but it becomes kind of boring and distracts from the plot line.  Some of the sex scenes go on so long I had to fast forward.  There is only so much heaving backs and moaning before one gets tired of it.",1465776000,,345,4.196969696969697
5735397,4,B00CRFQUDW,"This is an entertaining series with skilled and attractive actors.  The costumes are sumptuous and they and the scenery look authentic.  The writers took the bare bones arc of the Borgia saga and adorned it for dramatic purposes.  That is, when they weren't making incidents up of their own.  Other reviewers believe it was abruptly cancelled which probably explains its unfinished feel.

I've just finished reading a second book on the Borgias and I hope no one takes away from this series a lesson in history.  But the fact that they were thought worth portraying in a TV series meant it was the legend of the Borgias we would likely have served to us and not facts.  And that's exactly what this is.  Slight spoiler example: the latest arch-enemy of the Borgias was Caterina Sforza as the series wound down.  She sets up a phony shrine with a miraculous relic to drain off pilgrims on their way to Rome for the Jubilee Year of 1500.  This way the pilgrims have less money to give to the Papal coffers when they finally arrive in the city.  The fact of the matter was that she was already imprisoned by then by the Borgias and the whole incident was made up by the writers.

Enjoy the show but you might do as I did as a child with scary movies.  I kept repeating to myself ""it's only a movie, it's only a movie.""

PS> Rafael Sabatini's non-fictional ""Life of Cesare Borgia"" is a free download for your Kindle.  Sabatini leans maybe too far in the other direction but later scholars included his book in their bibliographies.  He makes some good points and as a veteran novelist is is very readable.",1465776000,7,1601,4.526132404181185

5735407,5,B00CRFQUDW,"When I first started watching The Borgias, it wasn't until around the middle of the second season - immediately I was hooked, so to the point that I had to buy the entire series. The Unholy Collection (Series pack of The Borgias) contains special features such as brief walk throughs with actors, previews, and of course the wonderful blooper reel. It is perfection for any fan of this series!

Naturally there are some historical aspects concerning the real Borgia family that most people will notice isn't included or has been altered for the sake of the story line, but even still I think this series does a fantastic job giving a glimpse into Rome and the ""first crime family"" (as Showtime dubbed them i believe) when they were in power. Now, I could go on and on about how awesome this show is: the dynamic plot, twists and turns, and of course the amazing acting by actors such as Jeremy Irons (DUH! That man is awe-inspiring) and the talented Francois Arnaud, but the real issue that fans across the country are (and will always be) currently talking about is:..........WHERE IS SEASON 4?! *flips table*",1458604800,10,1110,4.721649484536083

But the corruption within the major European families and buying your way into the Vatican was unfortunately comment The cast are remarkable Jeremy Irons is a tremendous Pope, he makes it clear from the get go that most of what a leader does is act He must ""appear"" chaste when he becomes Pope But he's having one affair after the other He's wickedly good The gorgeous Francois Arnaud as Cesare is every bit the dashing son-and master manipulator as he schemes his way to the top of the heap With his no conscience assassin Michaeleto at his side (turns out he does have a heart but you have to dig deep to find it) Ms Grainger is excellent as Lucrezia-the often used and abused daughter who starts to see she does have strength and power. There's lots of bed hopping Incest Murders by the score! With beautiful costumes and backdrops the whole thing looks like a renaissance painting. I loved every minute.

5735434,5,B00CRFQUDW,"This series is unbelievably enjoyable.  I couldn't stop watching it.  I never had Showtime only HBO so dare I say I didn't discover this series until 2015 on Netflix.  I loved it so much, I bought the Blu Ray and Soundtrack.  The music, especially the main title, is beautifully written.  Rarely do I see such series like this made anymore.  This series involves murder, corruption, bribery and sex and of course religion.  So there is something for everyone, lol.  I'm not Catholic so maybe that's why I listed religion last. Obviously no offense to those who are Catholic.  If you have an interest in renaissance period movies, which this takes place in the late 1400's,  I believe this may be up your alley.  All the actors performed their art beautifully. There was not one bad actor or actress in this.

Now.......... to my negative review of Showtime. Yes, I believe in touching all bases.  I was at the end of the series which was the third season, and the last show which was roughly an hour long like the rest of the episodes per season.  After it ended,  Netflix went into a different movie.  I was wondering what the hell happened.  I clicked back on Netflix to discover that was indeed the end and discovered Showtime cancelled it after the third season.  I can understand they have to make money etc. BUT,  the ending was horribly done.  It didn't seem like the end.  It left you wanting more.  They should have done a 2 hour finale or something along those lines to satisfy the loyal viewers of this series.  Although a few viewers don't make money.  Pope Alexander died in roughly 1503 which they were not far from after the third season.  Perhaps they should have at least considered including that as part of a finale.  Oh well, what's done is done.  I'm sure my opinion means absolutely s*** to Showtime.",1440806400,2,1822,4.595015576323988

Having read several books on the Borgias, there appears to be no true faithful adaption of their lives. Jeremy Irons is towering in his role as roderigo borgia, and the rest of the cast is truly excellent . It is a tragedy that it was cancelled after only three seasons.

5735454,4,B00CRFQUDW,"This highly fictionalized version of a fascinating part of the Renaissance and some of the characters in it includes great acting, scenery and costumes but is so far removed from historical fact as to be slightly ludicrous.  This is the only reason why I don't give it five stars.  The people it's about, as a rule, did indeed live during that time period, but most of the relationships and many of the events simply did not occur.  Lucretia Borgia did not poison herself, she died as a result of a difficult childbirth after several marriages and many pregnancies.  And there is absolutely no evidence that she and Cesare had an incestuous relationship.  But this makes for good television, especially when the actors are so incredibly attractive and charismatic.  There is some evidence however, that Machiavelli based the main character in The Prince on Cesare Borgia.  Our knowledge of historical fact during that period is sketchy, but not so totally lacking that this could even be called historical fiction.  It's highly entertaining, and I wish there had been further seasons of it, but I really hope no one bases any understanding of history or of the Borgia family on it.  It's important to note that much of the notoriety of the Borgia family can be laid at the feet of the Italian families like the De Medici, Sforsa, and Orsini who were no better behaved nor virtuous but who resented the fact that a family of questionable Spanish origin had taken over the Papacy and it's lands and risen to power normally reserved for their kinsmen.",1419379200,16,1548,4.811320754716981

5735469,4,B00CRFQUDW,"I do love a good historical costume drama.
It must be said first up that the costumes here are nothing short of spectacularly good, and with great attention to accuracy too!

Some of Jeremy Irons' papal vestments are SO spectacular that the Vatican should have purchased them immediately for ecclesiastical use after production was finished!
 (Although  they are so jewel encrusted and embroidered that they would probably appear too ostentatious, even for papal drag.)

The women's gowns and the men's doublets etc. all get great fine detail, and this, along with some amazing sets, makes the whole thing so often look like a Renaissance painting come to life.
Sure there's a lot of necessary CGI for the backgrounds and battles but it's combined very well with actual footage and the result is certainly wonderful to behold for the most part.

I bought the whole series, so was always in for the full haul, but Series One I was a little disappointed in, mainly due to the fact that there's just no one in the story to identify with or really care about what happens to them.
The entire cast are ALL so evil, so manipulative and SO thoroughly unlikeable that you begin to think they could all die and you wouldn't care.
The two older Borgia brothers are despicable greedy, self-obsessed maniacs , and even Lucretzia is just a spoiled little daddies-girl princess brat.
The cardinals, along with the catholic church itself are nothing more than rapacious self-serving leeches.
However the storyline certainly ramps up the action and those aforementioned sets and gorgeous costumes held my interest.

Series Two/Three are the better acts, and personal relationships start to come to the fore. There is an attempt to make the Pope somewhat more personable, and he vacillates between continuing his rampant nepotism and almost at times believing he actually IS god's representative here on earth. (Although this may be his justification for his constant pushing of his own will, rather than administering to his congregation!)
By this time I realised that character-wise the series was never going to throw up a ""hero"", as I started to find the physically unattractive Micheletto, (Cesar's totally unscrupulous murderous henchman) the most interesting one...and believe me, ...he's bad to the bone....well almost!
Despite his readiness to repeatedly carry out the most evil of deeds for Cesar, he does have feelings and sensitivity, vulnerability even, but it's very well hidden but when it is finally revealed it provides one of the most touching moments of the whole show.

The script makes Lucretzia more of a political pawn than any murderous femme-fatale, but in the latter parts of the show there are more attempts to humanise her to some degree, ...but you too will cringe with revulsion during her quite explicit incestuous sex-scenes with her own brother Cesar.
(***Note for those with prudish sensibilities: If any depiction of hetero/homo sex on screen bothers you, just don't buy this set. This is The Borgias, NOT Rebecca of Sunnybrooke Farm! It's presented as it would happen.)

The acting is good, the characterisations believable, if some of the situations aren't.
DO NOT TAKE THIS SERIES AS HISTORICAL FACT AT ALL!
There are just so many cases of history having been changed for whatever reasons, ....characters who we see as being dramatically killed by Cesar who in fact outlived him by several years; Savonarola being burned at the stake in Rome when his execution happened in Florence; and details of the Naples marriages and successions highly ""revised"". (Probably the kindest word?)
Lucretzia's ""escape"" from her confinement is little more than a ""Sleeping Beauty"" fairytale, complete with witch and the entire court falling into an enchanted....well drug-induced really, ...sleep!

I did enjoy the gutsy performance of Caterina Sforza. She's probably the only character with balls enough to try to stand up to the Borgia bullying, .... while the Cardinal who is to avoid repeated attempts at assassination and eventually succeed to the papal throne after the Borgias appears only intermittently, but then the whole series was cancelled and the producers were never able to make the final part of the story, ..which is indeed a great pity. I'm sure he would have had a bigger role if Series Four had ever been filmed.

The cinematography is undoubtedly lush, and as said before, often resembles Renaissance painting in composition, palette and lighting.
The transfer is great in full screen glory, but again like a lot of these productions, the dialogue itself can often be over ridden by the louder background music.  Mine's not Blu-Ray, but still looks amazingly beautiful.
Yes, as something of an historian there were times that I had to suppress disbelief, but nothing that will bother the average viewer, so long as they don't take this as anything at al like what actually happened.
I've given it FOUR stars, ....would like to have made it 4, but that facility isn't available here.",1407801600,4,5008,5.08029197080292

5735490,5,B00CRFQUDW,"There are two versions of the Borgia story that have come out recently - the one here by Showtime and the other by Canal +. They are different in many ways, but both are very good.

The actors portraying the same characters in the different series interpret them quite differently. Jeremy Irons is a more believable Pope than the Canal + guy. But, La Bella in the Canal + version is a more believable papal mistress. Other such comparisons could be made.

In many ways, the Canal+ version seemed to bring viewers more into the story than the other. Canal + gave a deeper experience is one way of putting it.

But, that being said, each version is good and entertaining in itself. I'd recommend watching one then the other.

Given that it is hard to separate fact from fiction in the history of the Borgias, I don't think it too productive to get into which series is more historically accurate - beyond major events which I'll leave to other reviewers to discuss. I watched more for entertainment than for a history lesson.

The Borgias had a reputation for being ruthless and calculating among other less ""worthy"" traits. There is lots of that on display in both series. But, to be fair to them, were they just caught up in the times they lived in? I tend to think they were not really much worse than many of the people around them. The times were pretty unsettled.

5735506,1,B00CRFQUDW,I don't see the point of this series. There was no one to root for.  This Family was a disgrace to the Catholic Faith. I didn't like any of the Characters in the series.  I didn't see any good people that were fighting the good fight. The only one to come close to a hero was the Cardinal who had monkey to taste his food to ensure his food wasn't poison and he wasn't portrayed as likable. And the Monk who walked around preaching against the Debauchery of the Borgias was portrayed as a Mad Man. Again how do you make a series where there are no Heros?,1387411200,5,554,4.12037037037037

8585270,5,B00CRFQUDW,"Excellent direction, casting, acting and costume design. I am a huge fan of the series. My only (and I believe important) complaint, is that the actors suffer from 'mispronunciation disease'.  Italian names are pronounced correctly by some characters, and woefully by others. This should have been picked up by the director/editor, and I found it terribly distracting.",1528848000,,368,5.456140350877193
