2946440,5,B000VS6Q7W,"My wife--who is from Japan--has been bugging me for months that I find this movie on DVD so we can watch it.  What great luck that this became available on Amazon.  I really thought I would have to find this in the Japanese video shop and nowhere else.  I mean, let's be honest, this movie has none of the typical elements we see in the American film market; no lawyers, cops, aliens, soldiers, explosions, guns, high technology or sex; it does not depict rich and/or hip people; but it's told so well, so nicely focused, that most Americans should not only be able to connect with the story and characters but really find themselves there.

Perhaps you've even been where they've been and felt what they felt in the film, scared your company is going to downsize you out of not only a job but a career, or maybe even that your entire town is so tied up in one industry that if that goes then the town is finished.  The characters in this story are confronting exactly that type of formidable and inevitable change.

This is a true story.  This actually happened.  In fact the resort is still there in the 'great white north' of rural Fukushima, Japan--an area so rural that it's known only for the Hawaiian resort and it's great camping spots.  And because it's a great, true story, I recommend you don't skip watching the bonus material on the second disc.

I absolutely love this film, more than my wife did I think, and must admit it's only one of maybe four films I've ever seen that caused me to cry of the thousands of films I have seen.

Simply wonderful storytelling.  It gets my highest recommendation.",1195603200,2,1612,4.501718213058419
2946441,5,B000VS6Q7W,"In the mid-1960s, coal mines in northern Japan were closing.  The locals dreamed of developing a ""Hawaiians"" resort, complete with hula dancers.  This dream clashed with those traditional miners, and parents, that longed for the mining days to continue. Hula Girls is based on a true story.

I was suspicious of the ""Hawaiian dancing"", as even in Hawaii it is a tourist-focused collage of Polynesian music and dance.  Indeed, in Hula Girls the dancing was  Hawaiian and Tahitian.  However, the hula was authentic, as were the costumes and equipment.  I assume the Tahitian dancing was also authentic (I've never been to Tahiti).  Dancer and actress Yu Aoi was charming and talented, as was Yasuko Matsuyuki and many of the actors.

There were many, many dramatic and humorous scenes in Hula Girls.  I guarantee that your eyes will water as the dancers tell their sensei, through dance, how they feel about her.  And the love interest seemed to be strongest between a man and his... palm tree.  I won't explain here, but it will make sense in the movie.

I was delighted that famed ukulele player Jake Shimabukuro composed the title song, Hula Girls.  I was irritated to note that, in this special 2 DVD package with its features of the making of the movie, the behind the scenes footage of the dance lessons, and a segment on the real Hula Girls (did I mention this is based on a true story?), there was no music video of Shimabukuro playing his songs.

In Hawaii, pleasing the Japanese tourists is a billion-dollar business.  The success of the Hawaiians resort in Japan is an indication of that love affair with all things Hawaiian.  Hula Girls, in real life and in this movie, also reflected that Hawaiian infatuation.

You will notice the background of Diamond Head in sets or posters throughout the movie, and you may also note the director's use of the mountain of mine tailings in a ""Diamond Head""-type formation.

This is a great movie for multiple ages, whether you know anything about Japan (or Hawaii) or not.  Remember that it is in Japanese, with English subtitles.

And I do believe it will encourage you to visit Hawaii!  If you do, be aware that the dancing in this film is high quality; a number of dances in the commercial luau you'll see offered to a gullible public tend to be more in the ""shake-your-bootie"" format.

You can see this movie more than once.  Go Girls!",1195603200,2,2387,4.723970944309928
2946442,3,B000VS6Q7W,"Hula Girls is a heartwarming story about a group of women related
to miners in the north of Japan. A mine will be closing leaving many
out of work. In an effort to keep jobs, the company wants to create a
miniature Hawaii in their city. They want and need Hula girls and bring
in a special teacher from Tokyo. The movie dramatizes this true story into a feel good movie about how these clumsy women turn into a very impressive group of professional dancers. We have seen a variation of this film so often- the, shall we say, transformation film. This one is merely okay- yet it will pull on the heartstrings even through the predictable ending.",1195516800,,644,4.466101694915254
2946443,5,B000VS6Q7W,"It's 1965 in rural, Iwaki, Japan. The cold/coal town is on the downswing with the local coal industry in decline.
A few town elders have a plan to revitalize the town by building a Hawaiian themed resort, which they hope will entice Japanese tourists to visit. The plan includes training local girls as hula dancers and sending them on a bus tour across Japan.

A teacher is recruited (she's a tough, former Tokyo dancer), and she slowly whips the girls (who are all country bumpkins) into a troupe of professional dancers, and more open-minded women.
But the local parents are offended by the skimpy hula costumes, the booty shaking, and the teacher herself (remember, she's a tough one), so the training of the girls is met with some protest.

There are many, many cliches in this film. (The spunky teacher who becomes the beloved. The country bumpkins who discover their inner sophistication and ability. The abusive father. Tragic accidents. The show must go on, no matter what.)
But--despite the cliches, this is a feel-good film about the power of sisterhood.

It may not be ""new"" in concept, but it's enjoyable, and even moving, nonetheless.

Bottom line: it's worth watching!",1195430400,2,1183,4.9296482412060305

The audience was enthralled and there were few dry eyes at the end of the film.

It was wonderful to watch their progress and success and especially since it is based on a true story.  It was a thoroughly enjoyable film.",1195430400,,499,4.43956043956044
2946445,4,B000VS6Q7W,"For those that have watched the Full Monty, Brassed off, you have a good idea of what to expect.  Yes, the story might be cliche but it's done very effectively in this offering.  Yet again, this is based upon a true story in a rural township in Japan in the mid-60s when the mining town is facing the dire situation of extinction as the main industry of mining coal is coming to an end.  A scheme is suggested to revive employment there by having a purpose built bath resort with a Hawaiian theme.  To do that, it needs hula girls.  In the beginning, recruiting the dancers is a tall order as Japan during that time is still conservative and baring too much flesh is a definite no-no.  However, there is a stubborn girl who steadfastly refuses to give up even though she's being excommunicated from her mother who happens to be a mining comittee member anti progressive movement.  However, she has a loving and supportive elderly brother who encourages her to follow her dream.  She would subsequently become the lead dancer.  Normally, a Hollywood offering would concentrate in training those misfits into successful people and we would sit through the routine of artificial gags to make us laugh.  For this instance, there is actually character development through the dancing teacher who is recruited from Tokyo.  She has a ferocious temper and running away from her demon for not being able to hit the big time in Tokyo.  As time progresses, as she sees commitment in eyes of those miners' daughters, she suddenly discovers herself by having a goal to turn the fate of the dying town around.  Hula Girls is a surprisingly touching movie and I'm deeply moved by it.  It's really amazing to read the end credit to say that Hula Girls are still running strong today and that the same teacher is still doing her thing at that resort now.  Highly recommended for a shot in the arm to follow our dreams.",1191542400,51,1901,4.649700598802395
2946446,3,B000VS6Q7W,"An entertaining bit of fluff based (more or less) on a real event: the unlikely founding of a Hawaiian-themed resort spa on the cold northern coast in Fukushima Prefectures coal country!  The temperature in Iwaki (the storys location) on average is about half that of Hawaii which may account (at least in part) for the spas continuing success.  Direction and acting are uneven.  Comedy scenes seem to be the directors forte (there are many hilarious moments in the first half of the movie), but not drama (dramatic scenes are too drawn out and hammy especially in the second half of the film).  Adult actors (and adults trying to act as juveniles) deliver the best performances.  Interiors (especially the practice dance studio and performance hall) are unrealistically amusing: this may be a prosperous coal town, but its not that prosperous!  (Interiors were shot at the resort spa.)  Subtitles are essential (the dialog is loaded with slang and delivered at Tokyo street speed), but tend to be a bit longish.  Cinematography (16:9 wide screen) and sound are fine (the apparent remix to elicit surround-sound is especially well done).  Even the production units name is kawaii: Black Diamond (aka coal).

2946451,5,B000VS6Q7W,"At first sight the story of Hula Girls looks like that of Stephen Daldrys Billy Elliot, but, based on a real-life story of Japanese women who made a difference in their community, Sang-il Lees comedy drama is equally inspiring and heart-warming, and also a touching story of sisterhood.

Set in 1965, in the town of Iwaki, Fukushima (located about 100 miles north of Tokyo), the film starts with Madoka Hirayama (Yasuko Matsuyuki), a down-on-her-luck dancer travelling from the metropolis to teach the local girls how to hula dance. There the coal mining company is forced to downsize the operations, so the companys president Norio Yoshimoto (Ittoku Kishibe) planned to form a hula dancing trope in order to revitalize the local economy.

Only a few apply for the job, including a teenage girl Sanae Kimura (Eri Tokunaga) and her best friend Kimiko Tanigawa (Yu Aoi). At first Madoka does not take her new job seriously, and most people ridicule the idea, but the girls are determined to make a change in the community and their life, too.

The incredible story is inspired by an actual theme park Joban Hawaiian Center (todays Spa Resort Hawaiians). Hula Girls is also memorable for its realistic period details re-creating the life in a coal mining town in the mid-1960s Japan. The impressive production designs are created by Yohei Taneda, designer of the Japanese pub Aobaya of Kill Bill Vol. 1.

Story-wise Hula Girls may be a little predictable, but with credible characters and effective performances (with a nice contrast between Madoka and Kimiko), the film is very enjoyable.",1389484800,,1586,5.019011406844107

2946456,5,B000VS6Q7W,"In 1966, a small coal-mining town in northern Japan began to feel the first glimmers of obsolescence. The company that owned the mines didn't want to abandon the families who had devoted their entire lives in their employ, so they decided to try something audaciously new. The mines had been plagued by hot springs that were a constant irritation, so they decided to try to make some lemonade... smile...

They put out a request for coal miners' daughters between ages 17 and 20, to volunteer for a dance troupe that would feature hula dancing. The idea was to provide the town with alternate employment by building a Hawaiian theme park AND utilize those pesky hot springs. Of course the citizens were fairly provincial and thought the dancing would be in the nude, so they tried to run the dance instructor out of town to protect their daughters.

This heartwarming story is based on the true experience of just such a town. If you are lucky enough to get the double DVD set from Amazon, Netflix or your library, please watch the extras because they interview some of the original girls from that first troupe AND that instructor! I love movies that show the learning process and these extras are frosting on the cake because they include the casting of the actresses in 2006 and their learning process, before they can depict the girls from 1966 and THEIRS. It's no wonder this film won so many well-deserved awards.

""Hula gru"" is in Japanese and the captions are excellent, the acting is a little over the top (remember, it's Japanese...), and as usual, each scene always lasts just a tad longer than I find comfortable; but once again, I want to thank the JayFlix.net participant who made this recommendation.

Besides being huge movie buffs, my husband and I lived in Takarazuka, Japan from August 1998 through February 2001 and have a great appreciation for the country and its culture. Just as my other favorite, this sweet film captures much of the understanding of the Japanese people and cultural norms while telling a moving story. The cast is excellent; the music is wonderful; and the story is well-told. Just as with most Japanese films, this one contains one over-the-top comic character who is a little annoying with his over-acting.

That these hula dancers are still active, forty years later, including their original teacher, and their town of Iwaki in Fukushima prefecture was devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, makes their story ever more poignant.  We attended a screening of the film and would love to find ways to support the people of this town who early on recognized the necessity to change their livelihoods to adapt to shifting economics.  Japan has since been an early adopter and adapter of sustainable technologies, energy resources and local foods and this film is an excellent reminder to all of us in the current global economy to always be willing to adapt and change in the face of a machiavellian world.  The production values of this film are excellent, as are the acting by the entire cast and the film is sweet, tender, tear-jerking but not saccharine.",1311120000,2,1100,4.835106382978723

The video transfer was pretty good in the most part, even if I noticed some scratches throughout. The audio was a little hard to hear, and had to put my player at almost the max audio volume.

The disc of bonus material has some really great clips, like a +40min of How to Be a Hula Girl, a small Making Of, another small clip of the 'real' Hula Girls, a small interview with the film scorer, and the original unsubbed trailer.

One of the interesting under currents of the movie is the well known hardiness of Japanese girls once they set their minds to get out there and do something for themselves. These are not the silly Japanese girls we read about on designer shopping sprees in in Europe - these girls in Hula Girl are on a mission and this true story is pretty inspiring.

And being from Hawaii, of course, I'm proud to know that this project (the center, not the film) actually accomplished what it set out to do.

The only thing I feel bad about for viewers who don't understand Japanese is that the Iwaki dialect is probably completely lost in translation for foreign audiences. It would be like watching ""Fargo"" with Japanese subtitles (and I have), where a lot of the subtlety comes as much from the local accent as from the words themselves; the Iwaki accent is easily as distinctive, and carries the same sense of rural innocence, as the exaggerated Minnesota accent employed by the Cohen brothers.  Key is a scene on the bus, as the troupe is heading towards a performance. The teacher, who is from Tokyo (and resolutely so), says a few words in what is clearly an Iwaki accent, indicating both the passage of time since she arrived, and her newfound willingness to let go of her urban identity and get closer to the girls she teaches.

The film was very sweet, uplifting and enjoyable, and I can see watching it again (but perhaps not again and again). It was, however, a little cliched, as it was very reminiscent of other films of this type, and at several points I was reminded of, in turn, Dirty Dancing, A League of Their Own (there was even a point where the teacher says that there is no crying allowed) or Billy Elliot.

The plot is also a little jumpy, and certain plot points are never played out. There is, for instance, the Tokyo teacher who almost instantaneously transforms from disillusioned drunk (even though we only see one episode of drunkenness) to tough-but-caring mentor. There is also a relationship between the teacher and one of the original dancers that ends up being very close and heart-rending, but we don't see how it got there - all of a sudden, the two are weeping and embracing, but we don't know why they are so attached. In contrast, the relationship between the teacher and Kimiko, one of the other original dancers and one of the stars of the film, is fully developed and logical.

Overall, however, these things can be overlooked if the viewer just expects this to be a feel-good, uplifting movie and nothing more. The acting is generally good (some actors are more subtle than others) and the dancing and costumes are a lot of fun!",1202601600,,1869,4.674772036474164

The '06 release `Hula Girls' which is based on an actual event is an absolutely exhilarating film that will immediately draw you into the storyline and have you rooting for the irresistible band of would-be hula girls from beginning to end. No wonder it won just about every major award in the '07 Japanese Academy Awards. I honestly cannot think of one negative thing to say about this production. It's dramatic, poignant, bittersweet and downright funny. The storyline is well conceived, the dialogue believable and the retro-Hawaiian soundtrack is in the perfect contrast to the drab landscape of the Japanese coal mining town where the new Hawaiian Center is being built.

This is a film I could watch over and over again and for me that's the bottom line in judging any film. By the way, did I forget to mention the charming and beautiful Aoi Yu in the role of Kimiko. I couldn't take my eyes off her, what an incredible smile!

2946480,4,B000VS6Q7W,"I rented this movie and will now buy it for my collection. It's listed as a comedy but it is anything but that.  It's more of a tear jecker drama which is why I recommend having tissue handy since it is the true story of a group of poor school girls who face an uncertain economic future and decide to join an Hawaiian dance troupe managed by an out of town (and out of place) ex-dancer.  Most of the movie covers a myriad of problems the girls must overcome to even put on the first show.  However the ending is spectacular and worth watching.  I highly suspect Hollywood will re-make this into an English version as was done with Masayuki Suo's ""Shall We Dance?"".  Might as well get a head start and watch the original Japanese version now, plus Yu Aoi is beautiful to see, especially once she dresses up as the Hula troupe lead dancer.",1201305600,,838,4.346153846153846
2946481,4,B000VS6Q7W,"This was a sweet story, set in the mid 60's, about a town in Japan that is about to have it's life blood cut off by the closing off the town's only business - coal mine. One man has a vision of turning the town into a tourist destination by creating a ""Little Hawaii"". The central plot revolves around a group of girls that decide to become the resort's ""Hula Girls"". It is a sweet, touching story that is reminiscent of many other movies with similar themes (""Full Monty"", etc). The translation did seem a bit rough. It seems as though they may have been trying to create a tone by using slang but it did not read well for me. The movie overcame the inferior subtitles. The movie won Japan's version of the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was an entertaining movie.",1200268800,,769,4.347222222222222
2946482,5,B000VS6Q7W,"Probably the biggest surprise of ""Hula Girls"", and what gives it such impact, is how it comes out of left field with its depth and emotion.  What appears to be a by-the-numbers feel good movie, about a bunch of fish-out-of-water types who aspire to something more, to the tune of ""Shall We Dance?"" or ""The Full Monty"", ends up being a brutal and violent tale, filled with prejudice and entrenched small town thinking.  This is ""Billy Elliot"".  This is ""Coal Miner's Daughter"".

Life is hard for coal miners, and during the mid-60s when demand for coal dropped off and the mines started closing, it became harsher still.  One of the lofty dreams of Japan at the time was the concept of life-time employment, where a company was your family and they looked after their employees faithfully.  Many such projects as the Joban Hawaiian Center were started at that time, attempting to replace vanishing industries with tourism and supplying new employment for company workers.  It was an admirable goal, rather than just discarding unneeded laborers to fend for themselves.  Most of the time it ended in failure, and the various ""Canada Lands"" and ""Holland Centers"" that populated the Japanese countryside are now all barren ruins.  The Hawaiian resorts still stands though, and the Hula Girls are still dancing.

Very loosely based on this true story, director Sang-il Lee artfully mixed the dull colors of the mining world with the bright promise of a better future in the flashing colors of Hawaii.  Korean-Japanese, Lee knows something about the harshness of attempting to bring new thoughts to a closed community, as he has shown in his first film ""Chong"".  He also understands the freedom and resilience of youth, having adapted Ryu Murakami's youth-rebellion novel ""69"". All of the actors shine as well, especially Yu Aoi as the lead dancer Kumiko.

Some of the appeal of ""Hula Girls"" will probably be lost on Western audiences, especially the performance of Shizuyo Yamazaki as the giant girl Sayuri.  Yamazaki is a famous comedian in Japan, known for her gruff manner and wearing guy's clothes, so seeing her dance around in a hula skirt is especially charming.  She also puts enormous depth into her character, something I didn't think she was capable of as an actress, and was quite moved by.",1199664000,35,2297,4.9453125

But the company comes up with a plan to help employ some of the folks - why not open Hawaii, a theme park within a greenhouse like dome, with palm trees and hula girls.  So many of the daughters of the coal miners get jobs as dancers to try to help the town.  Not just get cash for their families but to help the whole plan work and help employ others who may lose their jobs.  Girls will love it for the touching story.

2946484,3,B000VS6Q7W,"Having seen very few independent films in my life -- and never one that was Japanese -- I was looking forward to Hula Girls greatly.

Overall, the movie was entertaining. The premise -- young girls in a 1960s Japanese coalmining town take on the (til then) mysterious and vaguely scandalous art of hula dancing in order to save their laid-off families. The town hires Ms. Madoka Hirayama, a sophisticated ex-dancer from a prestigious Tokyo dance troupe, as the girls' instructor. Of course, it doesn't take long for the residents to wonder why someone would leave that sort of lifestyle for their plain, poor village...

As the girls begin to tackle the dancing -- which will be featured at the town's new Hawaiian Cultural Center, a desperate attempt to turn the town's fate -- they build and test friendships, struggle to gain approval from their traditional families, and learn what it takes to make it in the adult world.

However, it took a long time for the story to progress. Wanting to detail the girls' lives and allow viewers to fully appreciate their hardscrabble lives is understandable, but there were quite a few scenes that did absolutely nothing to progress the plot.

On the plus side, this DVD also comes with a myriad of bonus features, including a hula how-to and a bit about the real people on which the story is based.

On the whole, ""Hula Girls"" makes for an entertaining movie -- just don't set your expectations *too* high.",1199059200,,1448,4.776
2946485,5,B000VS6Q7W,"I was completely enchanted by this movie about growth and transformation, at the individual and community level.  A++++.  This movie tells the true story of how a bleak coal mining town transformed itself into a tropical resort destination (using natural hot springs in an otherwise decidedly untropical area) featuring hula dancers.

Like most stories of success against impossible/daunting odds, this one includes an appealing protagonist (the gorgeous Yu Aoi), a number of setbacks and obstacles, and a surly mentor and a community clinging to tradition and loath to change, who are both eventually won over by the hope and courage of a small group of dreamers.

Unlike most stories of success against impossible odds, this one is fascinating for its portrayal of small town Japanese life, for the particularly outstanding performances of its main characters, and for its wonderful glimpse into the world of hula dancing - an impressive art that I'm sure most of us have been exposed to in the most superficial of ways.

Enthusiastically recommended.

2946486,5,B000VS6Q7W,"In 1965 Japan, a small coal mining town must find a new way of life to survive as oil replaces the industry, but the older residents aren't comfortable with change. The plan to open a Hawaii themed vacation resort to provide jobs meets with strong opposition, especially the main attraction in development, a troupe of hula dancers recruited from among the town daughters themselves. The girls, led by a jaded teacher brought in from the big city, will have to overcome their clumsy shyness and band together to move their community forward if they are going to keep their town alive.

One can't deny that ""Hula Girls"" is a kind of story we've seen before. It could be described well as a much less obnoxious ""A League of Their Own,"" only set in '60's Japan. Yes, it's about a group of people bonding and triumphing over adversity, and it's an emotional rollercoaster ride along the way. But, there's something about ""Hula Girls"" that gives it a bit more heart than most movies of this type that I have seen. There's also just something about it that seems more real and appealing. Perhaps this is a matter of personal taste. It might be as simple as preferring to watch such a film about hula dancing over one about football or some other jock sport. There's also the added foreign film flavor (yes, you have to read subtitles if you don't understand Japanese) that may be more interesting to some. Still, if you like this kind of film, this one is worth a trial view. You're sure to cry at least once, and you'll be in love with young star Yu Aoi by the end of the film who is quite the Tahitian dancer!

This 2-disc Special Edition from Viz Pictures is a lovely presentation. The film is anamorphic widescreen and looks and sounds great, and there are some really nice extras. Disc One includes previews for 6 other Japanese films, plus text bios of the cast and director. Disc Two includes the original Japanese trailers (no subtitles on these trailers though), plus an interview with the composer (who speaks fine English) and three subtitled featurettes. The first featurette is a making-of, the second is a very lengthy but wonderful look at the training for the Hula Girls from the film, and last is a featurette about the real-life Hula Girls the film was based on.

""Hula Girls,"" which also seems to go by the title ""Hula Girl,"" was the Best Picture winner at the 2007 Japan Academy Awards, and it took several other awards there and elsewhere as well. Perhaps it may be a bit too familiar and heartwarming for much of today's cynical American audience to feel such praise is justified, but there is just something special about this movie. It may be the outstanding cast or the many tearful moments, or maybe the fantastic dancing!",1198022400,,2742,4.637860082304527
2946487,3,B000VS6Q7W,"""Hula Girls"" surprised me.  I expected a feel good movie that I could play for the younger, less cynical members of my extended family during the holidays.  Instead I found myself enjoying the film far more than I expected I would.

The plot is relatively simple and one that is both familiar and predictable.  It is 1965 and a cold, dreary, Japanese coal mining community is in trouble. The coal mine is no longer profitable and mass layoffs are in the cards.  The mining company, in what appears to be a far fetched plan, decides to use the geothermal hot springs (that have plagued the mines for decades) as the centerpiece of a Hawaii-style resort community.  In other words, the town will be converted to a Disney-like sort of Hawaii, complete with Hula Girls.

The Hula Girls are to be recruited and trained from the community and the recruiting and training of the local girls forms the heart of the movie.  There is resistance from the community. Some parents don't like the idea of their girls wearing grass skirts and shaking their hips. Many just think the whole plan diverts attention from the plight of the miners.  Based on a true story, we follow the lives of the recruits, of the townsfolk, and of the somewhat troubled big-city professional dancer brought up from Tokyo to teach the girls how to Hula.

On the surface this sounds pretty hokey and contrived, yet another artificially touching ""feel-good cinema story of the year"" plot.  However, good acting, cinematography, and writing takes this movie beyond its clichd plot and the result is a feel-good movie that, well, made me feel good.  The two leads, the dance teacher Miss Hirayama and the star pupil Kimiko (played by Yasuko Matsuyuki and Yu Aoi) are believable characters and the development of their relationship is very well done.  You really do want them to succeed against all odds.
The special features, including the real story of the Hula Girls and interviews with the real characters at the heart of the story are a welcome addition to the cast.

There are two slight downsides to this movie for me.

Despite the good performances the very concept of the movie makes it difficult for the story to develop any tension as the plot plays itself out.  We know going in that things are likely to end up in a certain way and, for the most part, the viewer won't be disappointed

Second, I think one age group most likely to be absorbed and entertained by this movie are pre-teens.  However, Hula Girls is in subtitles (and I prefer subtitles to dubbing) and I'm not sure that a younger audience would be able to track the subtitles in pace with the movie.  A lot depends on the child's reading speed of course.  This may be one DVD where a dubbed option would really benefit the enjoyment of a younger audience.

All in all, the acting and film work in Hula Girls outweighs the pretty formulaic story line and this makes for a pretty enjoyable family viewing experience. Well worth a look.

2946488,3,B000VS6Q7W,"This is a difficult review for me to write.  I certainly want to celebrate Viz Media and their releases, and I would love to be able to lend them my editorial support so that they can continue bringing us Japanese cultural items.  I also happen to be a Japanologist myself, Japan is my primary area of study, and so I must constantly ask myself if I'm enjoying the product based upon the product itself and its merits, or if I'm only interested in it from the perspective of Japanese studies.

While Hula Girls is by no means a bad movie, it does fall into the popular cliche of taking a ""true"" story, something about a teacher or a coach, a group of (sometimes unwilling, or untalented) students, and turning it into a tear-jerker.

And it does have some interesting merits (which I won't spoil), and at its best, it even makes stabs in the direction of feminism and impresses with interesting cinematography and direction.  At its worst, sadly, it comes off as another sort of Dangerous Minds/Remember the Titans/The Mighty Ducks etc kind of movie, only this time set in Japan, and I think this is one formula that's been done to death, and probably done better.

The extras contained on the second DVD are fine, and if you enjoy the movie and are interested in it, you'll also enjoy the interviews and snippets and mini-documentaries they've included, though they did not convert me into any kind of ""fan"" of the film.  If I hadn't been reviewing the movie, I wouldn't have bothered with the extras.

As much as I'd actually like to recommend Hula Girls, I'm really unable to.  It's a decent film that many will find entertaining, but it has nothing to make it stand out.",1197417600,4,1674,4.590604026845638
2946489,5,B000VS6Q7W,"There have been lots of sports-themed movies dealing with characters who overcame obstacles and beat the odds to emerge successful. Having this type of movie based on Hula dancing was an interesting idea and my wife and I liked it very much.

You can read the Amazon description as well as the other reviews for a synopsis of the plot so I won't repeat it here.  What I'd like to say is that while predicatable (I don't think I am spoiling anything by telling you this is one of those feel-good movies), it was very well made, the acting was good, the characters likable, and it is also entertaining for the entire family. It's good, clean fun that grabs your attention and has you rooting for the girls to succeed in their Hula dancing endeavor.

What I also liked about the movie is the fact that there is no English dubbing, only English subtitles.  I hate how foreign movies are ruined by unnatural-sounding English voiceovers.  I don't understand Japanese but the tones and inflection in the voices makes it clear what the emotions are in the scene, and the subtitles seem to be done very well.  No ""engrish"" here!  I did notice, however, that the subtitles use ""ain't"" and other slang grammar quite frequently.  I took this to be a translation of the way the poor, comparatively less educated villagers spoke compared to their more learned city counterparts.

I've never been a fan of hula dancing but after watching this movie, I have to say I now have an appreciation of this art. The soundtrack for the movie is pretty good, also.  Don't expect it to be all or even mostly Hula music.

Like I said, it's a rather predictable movie but since the characters are so likable, things happen like you want them to happen and you feel good about it.  At least my wife and I did.  I think most people will, too.",1197158400,2,1812,4.538461538461538

In 1965 the Japanese coal mining town of Iwaki is facing disaster; coal mining is rapidly becoming unprofitable.  In order to survive, the Joban Kosan Corporation, owners of the mine, needs to find some other kind of business to do, and in keeping with the slogan ""One Mountain, One Family"", whatever they come up with needs to save the town and as many of the workers as possible, too.  Their truly cockamamie solution?  To make lemons out of lemonade by turning the geothermal springs they spend huge amounts of money pumping out of the mine into the basis for a Hawaiian-style resort and theme park, the first of its kind in Japan, with former mineworkers and their families providing as many of the workers as possible, most especially the resort's Hula dancers.  This is their story.

The reaction of the mine workers is barely restrained hostility, but to a handful of their daughters, this is their chance to seek out an alternate future to a short life of backbreaking labor and fingernails blackened with coal dust no matter how thoroughly they wash.  Sanae Kimura (Eri Tokunaga) and her best friend Kimiko Tanikawa (Yu Aoi), a widow with a small son, and a shy giantess whose coal miner father pushes her to try, make up the entire class awaiting Madoka Hirayama (Yasuko Matsuyuki) the imperious dancing teacher from Tokyo who shows up drunk, motion sick, and wondering just what the Hell she has let herself be talked into.  Nevertheless, overcoming an increasingly implausible mountain of obstacles she and her students, expanded eventually by economic desperation (later students volunteer even though they'd rather not dance naked and are quite relieved to be informed that they won't be stripping!), persevere until their final performance at the resort opening leaves you cheering and crying simultaneously.

If this sounds a little too corny, don't worry, riveting performances by one and all keep your disbelief suspended.  Etsushi Toyokawa as Kimiko's protective older brother Yojiro and Madoka's knight in coal dust encrusted armor and Junko Fuji as Kimiko's intolerant and intransigent widowed mother Chiyo are particularly strong.  Certain scenes will stay with me for a while: Madoka's disastrous arrival in (what she sees as) Hick Hell, Madoka marching into the men's bathhouse to expound her views to one of the miners over his having beaten up his daughter for secretly being one of her students (he survives the discussion... barely), her students convincing Madoka not to go through with leaving, Chiyo delivering a package to her estranged daughter and seeing her dance for the very first time, Chiyo pleading to borrow stoves to save the imported but now dying palm trees, Yojiro ""dealing with"" Madoka's tormentors, and of course their final, stunning performance that not only brought the extras to their feet but also a Hawaiian audience skeptical about the concept of Hawaiian-style anything, after viewing it at the Hawaii International Film Festival.

The DVD extras give some hints of why this movie works so well.  Clearly the actress dancers were more than a little awed by encountering the real people, particularly the real dance instructors, who lived the real story and by the idea of performing in front of the current class of professional dancers in the scenes shot on location at the resort.  You can almost see them becoming that original group of girls struggling to learn their dances and determined not to disappoint.  Remarkably, Eri Tokunaga, whose character is eliminated by circumstance part way through the movie, continues her dance practice and accompanies the cast to the resort location where she is shown rolling and wetting towels and doing anything she can think of to help her fellow cast members nail their on film performances, while they inspire themselves by doing the famous cheer offstage before going on.  The resulting performance is better than anything the director was expecting, as he admits, and after movie filming finishes Eri is called up on stage to dance the finale with the rest of the cast.

The extras also reveal, according to the real participants and as I suspected, that the obstacles to be overcome had been exaggerated considerably in the screenplay;  I already had my doubts about tragic mine accidents, debt collecting gangsters, fathers beating up their daughters, unrelenting community hostility, etc., etc., etc., ALL being true during that first incredible year, but the excellent performances delayed this reaction until after the movie was over.

This story so inspiring it inspired the actresses themselves to exceed expectations is not to be missed!",1197158400,6,5039,5.404336734693878
2946491,4,B000VS6Q7W,"Hula Girls tells the true story of how a few dedicated Japanese girls helped to save their coal-mining town from closure. While the underdog aspect of this story feels quite familiar, the uniquely Japanese characters, dialogue, mannerisms and setting make Hula Girls a one-of-a-kind movie experience. Casting is exceptional, with truly extraordinary performances played by the actress who plays the Hula teacher newly arrived to the small coal-mining town of Iwaki from Tokyo in 1965 and the girls who overcome family pressures to stay home rather than travel across Japan doing hula dance performances to entice Japanese tourists to come stay at the newly constructed Polynesian resort. With a somewhat slow start, the story really picks up once the dance lessons begin, after an initially bumpy start as prudish mores scare the first batch of potential dance girls away.

My favorite parts of Hula Girls were the dance scenes, and I found myself wishing there were more such scenes in the movie, as that's where the magical transformation for the characters took place and it's also the center of the film. Some scenes seemed a bit predictable and slow, with acting slightly remniscent of anime characters over-the-top emotional outbursts... but most of the dance scenes hit just the right tone, showing how the art of hula and an insistence on smiling and moving fluidly to tell stories with one's hands could lift a town's spirits and keep its community thriving and alive.

I was slightly disappointed with the special features disk, as some of the special features are entirely in Japanese with no English subtitles. I watched them anyway because it was fascinating to watch the real-life hula girls getting trained to dance the hula with the real life dance instructor in Iwaki.

I recommend Hula Girls for everyone who loves dance, hula, Japanese culture and stories of how it's possible to rise above all kinds of obstacles to make one's dreams come true.",1197158400,2,1964,5.055555555555555

Nicely shot with a period look of both the sixties style and glorious good old film, HULA GIRLS often wanders into what we' see in the west as cartoonish characterizations of dominantly, and dumbly, Japanese male role models in a crappy way-of-life on the decline. But beneath the often overplayed buffoonery of the men in the film -either morons or jerks or corporate shills- is a sweetly done film worthy of both praise and a wider audience. Great camera work and excellent editing; superb use of (lack of) color where needed plays well as the vibrance of colorful costu...oops, giving too much away.

So, can the girls learn the intricate moves of the hula, perform at the center and move above the filth of a mining life? You'll need to see it through yourself.

I thoroughly enjoyed this ""based on fact"" import from Japan. You can read the item description for a synopsis; I won't waste your time on that. That said, I am probably echoing what a lot of the other positive reviewers said & that should tell you something...but the performances were all first rate. Check out the list of awards on IMDB (all from Japan, of course). Matsuyuki and Aoi really deserved their nominations and wins.

It made me laugh and cry. Sure I would say that I knew roughly how it was going to turn out...but can't you say that about 99% of TV and 90% of movies made these days. It's the telling of the story that was so skillfully done by all involved and the glimpse into a portion of Japanese culture I had not had before that made this a film to watch.

My one beef is that there was an overuse of slow motion to highlight emotional moments in the last half hour of the film. It got a bit old.

This is a fine use of your entertainment dollar and time. The extras are great (which is, sadly not always the case). The interview with the actual people the movie is based on is fascinating.",1196985600,3,1295,4.295081967213115
2946494,4,B000VS6Q7W,"This winner of eight Japanese Academy Awards (including best screenplay, best director, and best actress) and a staple of many US film festivals, ""Hula Girls"" is the quintessential feel-good movie. Based on a true story and set in 1965, the film has all the requisite ingredients:  long odds, characters with spunk, big stakes,  and a balance of comic and tear-jerker moments

In the small, gritty town of Iwaki, the residents rely solely on the prosperity of the Joban mine.  The men plunge into the mines for rotating shifts while the women rake the coal debris on the surface.  When rumors circulate that the mine will be closed, thus devastating the entire town, the idea is born to make ""Hawaii"" and thus paradise in this cold, remote town in northern Japan.  And how can one have a Hawaiian resort without hula dancers?  Over the objection of parents and conservative members of the town, a band of young coalminers' daughters and one widow embark on getting the coal out from under their fingernails and putting the shake into their hips.  A down-and-out dance teacher from Tokyo is imported, and they all embark on saving their town from imminent collapse.  In a town so removed from the center of Japan that the locals speak Korean, the hula girls must transform from ""country bumpkins"" into graceful dancers, something no one believes is possible.

The two stars of this film, Yasuko Matsuyuki (Ms. Hirayama) and Yu Aoi (the star dancer Kimiko), deliver complex and riveting performances, although they are supported by fine acting all around.  Aoi, in particular, glows whenever on screen, and her final performance of a Tahitian dance is simply explosive.  Lee Sang-il (69, SCRAP HEAVEN) directs with authority, and cinematographer Yamamoto (The Grudge) captures the bleakness of the coal mine and the vibrancy of dance.  Without such talent bringing the screenplay to life, this would be just another film about underdogs.

The DVD special features are somewhat interesting: interviews with the two women on whom the main characters were based; a short clip about the training the women received; an interview with soundtrack composer Shimatukuro; and information about making the movie.

Set in a Japanese coal-mining town, Hula Girls recounts the story of several women who try to find a life outside the mining industry by becoming professional hula dancers.

The story itself is the same coming-of-age, underdog-beating-the-odds plot that has been recounted time and again in movies.  Even so, I think it's a really good one to watch on a dreary day when you're feeling self-pitying and have a huge tub of popcorn in front of you.  It has a lot of humor, a lot of heart, and a lot of well-choreographed hula dancing.

While I don't think I would purchase this DVD (as I don't know how many times I'd actually watch the movie), I think it's a great one to rent, and it comes loaded with a lot of extra information about hula dancing and the true story that inspired the movie.",1196726400,,930,4.479289940828402
2946496,4,B000VS6Q7W,"""Hula Girls"" is an enchanting film, based on a true story, and it won the Japanese equivalent of the Best Picture Oscar.  Set in a northern Japan coal-mining town in the mid-1960's, it dramatizes the efforts of a group of young women to become hula dancers for a Hawaiian-themed amusement center.  Even though it is presented as a way to generate revenue for the town, many of the residents resist its development, even as many of them are being laid off. The film centers on Kimiko, a charming young woman who sees this as her ticket out of a mine-related career in her small town.  The instructor who is hired, Ms. Hirayama, arrives drunk and disillusioned and deems hopeless the task of teaching these ""bumpkins"" how to dance. But, as one would expect from this type of film, the girls get better and overcome adversity, the instructor has a change of heart, and everything leads up to the big-show finale.  The script has many other predictable elements of the ""underdogs-triumph"" film: the parents who don't understand, or even, in Kimiko's case, disown her; the ""ugly-duckling"" dancer; the tragedy that lies in wait in the midst of triumph, etc.  That said, this movie rises above the formula with strong performances, especially from Y Aoi (Kimiko), Yasuko Matsuyuki (Ms. Hirayama) and Junko Fuji (Kimiko's mother Chiyo); and with some captivating hula dance sequences, especially, of course, the crowd-pleasing finale.  Though it definitely has some ""chick-flick"" elements as well, I still recommend it for family viewing - it is, after all, an inspiring true story.",1196640000,,1574,4.988549618320611
2946497,5,B000VS6Q7W,"What is the liklihood that a remote mining town in northeast Japan can reverse its downhill economic course by getting a dance teacher from Tokyo to teach hula dancing to local girls to help generate revenue for the town's recovery via the Joban Hawaiian Center? Well, that is what happened in the town of Iwaki. Due to what many viewed as a hair-brained scheme, unlikely circumstances brought success back to this former mining town in this sensitive and heart-warming film.

The film takes place in 1965, the initial scene is a stark hill, built from the dirt removed from the mine. There Kimiko and her good friend Sanae discuss their interest in learning the hula dance to join the local Joban Hawaiian Center. Both apply and are accepted. Kimiko's mother is dead set against her daughter dancing half-naked on stage. In anger, Kimiko moves out to the dance center to follow her dream of becoming a professional dancer. There is a comical scene in which Ms Hirayama the dance teacher arrives to this humble mining town ... in a motorized cart when the real transportation breaks down. The country miners stare at this attractive female who is dressed in her fine city clothes, wearing her signature sunglasses. It is a hilarious scene. The dance auditions are well done. The film  focuses on four main dancers, Kimiko, Sanae, a housewife, and a tomboy named Sayuri. From their stiff postures and movements it is quite evident Ms Hirayama has her work cut out for her. She begins teaching basic dance moves and builds their skills and confidence. The scene where the girls first try on their costumes and shake their hips in grass skirts superbly contrasts their newly acquired skills with their previous efforts. The locals are skeptical that a dance center will have any impact on their circumstances ...

Once the dance troupe had learned several Hawaiian dances, they were taken on tour to nearby venues to perform. At one stop, the audience, mostly men, was anticipating a ""girlie"" type dance show. At first, they cheered but later booed after learning the program was not what they expected. Performances at other locations proved quite successful. Enthusiasm for the Iwaki Hawaiian dancers grows. The manager of the dance troupe had even imported palm trees to authenticate the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the cold weather threatened the survival of these exotic plants. A supporter of the project asked for donations of heaters and stoves to create a hot climate to help the trees endure the cold front. Amazingly, Kimiko's mother, Chiyo became one of the most ardent supporters of this plan. She realized her whole life revolved around the coal mining industry which was a harsh existence. It dawned on Chiyo that Kimiko's plan to dance provided her a great escape from this lifestyle.

The film has various subplots which include different characters whose lives were touched deeply by learning hula dancing and becoming a member of the local dance troupe. The film takes disparate elements and builds a fascinating film from the incongruity. The film shows how one man with a seeming impossible dream built a successful enterprise which eventually became famous throughout Japan. With enthusiastic energy and hard work, unskilled country girls were transformed into a beautiful authentic Hawaiian dance troupe. The originally skeptics became a unified community, who helped the dancers make an impossible dream come true.

This DVD has enhanced features with interviews of real dancers who participated in the original dance troupe created at the Joban Hawaiian Center. The center was later converted into a spa and resort. There is  an interview with the original hula dance teacher who taught the country girls of Iwaki how to dance. The role of Ms Hirayama was created based on this real life example. It is easy to understand why this film won a Japanese Academy Award.

In my humble opinion this was not a movie about dancing the ""Hula"". Being a guy, I like seeing pretty girls dance the hula, however I think it would have been a boring film if it was just about group of girls learning to dance. The story is more about a town (and in particular) a group of young ladies struggling with the changes that were being forced upon them. Change is not easy, and this movie is about the struggle, not the dance. But never fear, towards the end of the movie you will see some nice Hula dancing. I give it a ""thumbs up"".",1196380800,,803,4.147435897435898
2946500,5,B000VS6Q7W,"Based on a true story, Hula Girls is a real charmer of a film. It won the equivalent of the Japanese Academy awards and it is quite a feel-good film.

The story is based on the story of a mining town in a remote prefecture of Japan. The mine is closing, leaving the workers without any employment. The mine engages in a really dicey venture, to open a hot spring with a Hawaiian theme. Seems the mine is constantly filling up with hot water from a local hot spring, so the idea is to use the water to fill the spa and forget about mining coal. Coal was being replaced by (cheap) oil. Times were changing.

The town brings in Ms. Hirayama as professional hula teacher, a gal with a shady past. She is none too thrilled to be teaching the local coalminers' daughters. She shows up stinkin' drunk, not a good omen, and soon her gangster nemesis follows, chasing her for her mother's presumed gambling debts. But somehow, she connects with Sanae and Kimiko, and eventually more girls show up to become professional dancers.

The rest of the film is about the development of the spa and the resistance of the old-timers to the changes. This could be filmed anywhere, Poland, West Virginia. But there is a happy ending despite the changing times.

The film director wisely chose to let the dancing speak for itself at the end and we are treated to most of the Hula show, which is a real treat. Many directors would have just had a cut or two, but we get most of the show at the end, which was a delight. Everyone cries, and maybe you will too. This is a delightful film.

The music (Jake Shimabukuro) is fantastic and as much a character of the film as the actors. There are extras about the film, the real town, and the real people as well as the Japanese trailers. The subtitles get the feel of the rural Japanese dialect and the rough language of the miners.

Director Lee Sang-Il and his cast of fresh faced and believable actresses bring a great story to the screen, filled with warm humor and tender moments.

It's a touching story about following your dreams and sticking with them, even in hard times. It won the Japanese Academy award for best picture and the acting was terrific. The acting is wonderful - I especially loved the characters of Ms. Hirayama, Kimiko and her brother and Sanae.

2946504,4,B000VS6Q7W,"Iwaki, Japan, was once a thriving coal town.  In the late 60's, however, coal is on its way out as a primary energy source and the local mine is likely to be shut down soon causing over 4000 miners to lose their jobs.  In an effort to capitalize on the local warm springs, and generate alternative jobs from tourism, the mining company decides to create a ""Hawaii Center"" and insists that it be run exclusively by miners.  They recruit local girls to become Hula dancers, all to be trained by a professional dancer from Tokyo with a difficult and possibly shady past.  This is a ""triumph of the underdog"" film -- in the genre of films like Karate Kid or Rocky or, possibly more closely, The Full Monty and Calendar Girls and Sexy Boots.  The film reminded me most of Chris Eyre's film Edge of America, about a group of young Native American girls who find themselves playing women's basketball.

While the film is very conventional in style and editing and storytelling approach -- so much that it evokes the innocence of an earlier period of filmmaking -- it looks very good on this dvd.  The color scheme of the film to begin with feels washed out and drab, both evoking the period it depicts and suggesting the drabness of a coal town.  Almost the only vibrant colors you see are those of the costumes on the Hula Girls -- but when they begin to develop confidence it seems as though, subtly, the tone even of the city becomes warmer, as if the vibrancy of their outfits and their dancing were spreading into the town.  The acting, if occasionally a bit over the top and melodramatic, is consistent throughout and convincing on the whole.  (The dancing is very impressive.)

The story focuses on Kimiko, whose family rejects her for her decision to become a Hula girl.  Local prejudice, longstanding tradition, and fear of change, all form obstacles to the development of the center.  Of course, there is no doubt where the story will end, with reconciliations and triumph and tears.  While this a film that is unafraid to wear its heart on its sleeve, it is so sincere in its melodramatic presentation of the trials and triumphs and the vulnerability and hopes of the young girls, that it would be hard not to get caught up in the emotion and excitement of the story and to forgive the filmmakers a few digressions and a few moments that push melodrama a bit too far.  There are genuinely touching moments in this film -- moments you want to cheer and moments you'd want to cry, moments that are sentimental but in which the sentiment does not feel forced.  There are also a few moments that go a bit over the top -- as in the whole story of a miner who takes on the responsibility of caring for the exotic trees of the Hawaii Center, and who seems almost to fall in love with one tree in particular, who cries over its failing health.  The film does fall prey to stereotypes and cliches -- the gruff miners, the disapproving mother, the reluctant teacher who rises to the occasion, etc.  And there are a few storylines that seem like digressions and really go nowhere -- but, I guess, life is like that.  In spite of cliches, predictable turns, occasionally mawkish sentimentality, the film as a whole works because it is so sincere and straightforward and consistent.  Like the plucky young dancers who try to wear a smile even when things are at their worst, the film almost dares you to dismiss it.  In the end, I found myself moved.  On the whole, this is a worthy and sincerely told story and a nice celebration of several young women and their teacher, who achieved something remarkable against the odds and who established a legacy that remains today in Japan.

This dvd set includes not only the film but also several informative documentaries on Hula dancing, on the history of the Hula girls, and on the making of the film.",1195603200,2,3838,4.570802919708029
3180937,5,B000VS6Q7W,"My wife--who is from Japan--has been bugging me for months that I find this movie on DVD so we can watch it.  What great luck that this became available on Amazon.  I really thought I would have to find this in the Japanese video shop and nowhere else.  I mean, let's be honest, this movie has none of the typical elements we see in the American film market; no lawyers, cops, aliens, soldiers, explosions, guns, high technology or sex; it does not depict rich and/or hip people; but it's told so well, so nicely focused, that most Americans should not only be able to connect with the story and characters but really find themselves there.

Perhaps you've even been where they've been and felt what they felt in the film, scared your company is going to downsize you out of not only a job but a career, or maybe even that your entire town is so tied up in one industry that if that goes then the town is finished.  The characters in this story are confronting exactly that type of formidable and inevitable change.

This is a true story.  This actually happened.  In fact the resort is still there in the 'great white north' of rural Fukushima, Japan--an area so rural that it's known only for the Hawaiian resort and it's great camping spots.  And because it's a great, true story, I recommend you don't skip watching the bonus material on the second disc.

I absolutely love this film, more than my wife did I think, and must admit it's only one of maybe four films I've ever seen that caused me to cry of the thousands of films I have seen.

3180938,5,B000VS6Q7W,"In the mid-1960s, coal mines in northern Japan were closing.  The locals dreamed of developing a ""Hawaiians"" resort, complete with hula dancers.  This dream clashed with those traditional miners, and parents, that longed for the mining days to continue. Hula Girls is based on a true story.

I was suspicious of the ""Hawaiian dancing"", as even in Hawaii it is a tourist-focused collage of Polynesian music and dance.  Indeed, in Hula Girls the dancing was  Hawaiian and Tahitian.  However, the hula was authentic, as were the costumes and equipment.  I assume the Tahitian dancing was also authentic (I've never been to Tahiti).  Dancer and actress Yu Aoi was charming and talented, as was Yasuko Matsuyuki and many of the actors.

There were many, many dramatic and humorous scenes in Hula Girls.  I guarantee that your eyes will water as the dancers tell their sensei, through dance, how they feel about her.  And the love interest seemed to be strongest between a man and his... palm tree.  I won't explain here, but it will make sense in the movie.

I was delighted that famed ukulele player Jake Shimabukuro composed the title song, Hula Girls.  I was irritated to note that, in this special 2 DVD package with its features of the making of the movie, the behind the scenes footage of the dance lessons, and a segment on the real Hula Girls (did I mention this is based on a true story?), there was no music video of Shimabukuro playing his songs.

In Hawaii, pleasing the Japanese tourists is a billion-dollar business.  The success of the Hawaiians resort in Japan is an indication of that love affair with all things Hawaiian.  Hula Girls, in real life and in this movie, also reflected that Hawaiian infatuation.

You will notice the background of Diamond Head in sets or posters throughout the movie, and you may also note the director's use of the mountain of mine tailings in a ""Diamond Head""-type formation.

This is a great movie for multiple ages, whether you know anything about Japan (or Hawaii) or not.  Remember that it is in Japanese, with English subtitles.

And I do believe it will encourage you to visit Hawaii!  If you do, be aware that the dancing in this film is high quality; a number of dances in the commercial luau you'll see offered to a gullible public tend to be more in the ""shake-your-bootie"" format.

Yes, the story might be cliche but it's done very effectively in this offering.  Yet again, this is based upon a true story in a rural township in Japan in the mid-60s when the mining town is facing the dire situation of extinction as the main industry of mining coal is coming to an end.  A scheme is suggested to revive employment there by having a purpose built bath resort with a Hawaiian theme.  To do that, it needs hula girls.  In the beginning, recruiting the dancers is a tall order as Japan during that time is still conservative and baring too much flesh is a definite no-no.  However, there is a stubborn girl who steadfastly refuses to give up even though she's being excommunicated from her mother who happens to be a mining comittee member anti progressive movement.  However, she has a loving and supportive elderly brother who encourages her to follow her dream.  She would subsequently become the lead dancer.  Normally, a Hollywood offering would concentrate in training those misfits into successful people and we would sit through the routine of artificial gags to make us laugh.  For this instance, there is actually character development through the dancing teacher who is recruited from Tokyo.  She has a ferocious temper and running away from her demon for not being able to hit the big time in Tokyo.  As time progresses, as she sees commitment in eyes of those miners' daughters, she suddenly discovers herself by having a goal to turn the fate of the dying town around.  Hula Girls is a surprisingly touching movie and I'm deeply moved by it.  It's really amazing to read the end credit to say that Hula Girls are still running strong today and that the same teacher is still doing her thing at that resort now.

Set in 1965, in the town of Iwaki, Fukushima (located about 100 miles north of Tokyo), the film starts with Madoka Hirayama (Yasuko Matsuyuki), a down-on-her-luck dancer travelling from the metropolis to teach the local girls how to hula dance. There the coal mining company is forced to downsize the operations, so the companys president Norio Yoshimoto (Ittoku Kishibe) planned to form a hula dancing trope in order to revitalize the local economy.

Only a few apply for the job, including a teenage girl Sanae Kimura (Eri Tokunaga) and her best friend Kimiko Tanigawa (Yu Aoi). At first Madoka does not take her new job seriously, and most people ridicule the idea, but the girls are determined to make a change in the community and their life, too.

The incredible story is inspired by an actual theme park Joban Hawaiian Center (todays Spa Resort Hawaiians). Hula Girls is also memorable for its realistic period details re-creating the life in a coal mining town in the mid-1960s Japan. The impressive production designs are created by Yohei Taneda, designer of the Japanese pub Aobaya of Kill Bill Vol. 1.

3180953,5,B000VS6Q7W,"In 1966, a small coal-mining town in northern Japan began to feel the first glimmers of obsolescence. The company that owned the mines didn't want to abandon the families who had devoted their entire lives in their employ, so they decided to try something audaciously new. The mines had been plagued by hot springs that were a constant irritation, so they decided to try to make some lemonade... smile...

They put out a request for coal miners' daughters between ages 17 and 20, to volunteer for a dance troupe that would feature hula dancing. The idea was to provide the town with alternate employment by building a Hawaiian theme park AND utilize those pesky hot springs. Of course the citizens were fairly provincial and thought the dancing would be in the nude, so they tried to run the dance instructor out of town to protect their daughters.

This heartwarming story is based on the true experience of just such a town. If you are lucky enough to get the double DVD set from Amazon, Netflix or your library, please watch the extras because they interview some of the original girls from that first troupe AND that instructor! I love movies that show the learning process and these extras are frosting on the cake because they include the casting of the actresses in 2006 and their learning process, before they can depict the girls from 1966 and THEIRS. It's no wonder this film won so many well-deserved awards.

""Hula gru"" is in Japanese and the captions are excellent, the acting is a little over the top (remember, it's Japanese...), and as usual, each scene always lasts just a tad longer than I find comfortable; but once again, I want to thank the JayFlix.net participant who made this recommendation.

Just as my other favorite, this sweet film captures much of the understanding of the Japanese people and cultural norms while telling a moving story. The cast is excellent; the music is wonderful; and the story is well-told.

That these hula dancers are still active, forty years later, including their original teacher, and their town of Iwaki in Fukushima prefecture was devastated by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, makes their story ever more poignant.  We attended a screening of the film and would love to find ways to support the people of this town who early on recognized the necessity to change their livelihoods to adapt to shifting economics.  Japan has since been an early adopter and adapter of sustainable technologies, energy resources and local foods and this film is an excellent reminder to all of us in the current global economy to always be willing to adapt and change in the face of a machiavellian world.

I've seen this as a digital download, and much prefer the subtitles to that than this one. It isn't that it's a bad translation, but some subtleties were missing.

The video transfer was pretty good in the most part, even if I noticed some scratches throughout. The audio was a little hard to hear, and had to put my player at almost the max audio volume.

The disc of bonus material has some really great clips, like a +40min of How to Be a Hula Girl, a small Making Of, another small clip of the 'real' Hula Girls, a small interview with the film scorer, and the original unsubbed trailer.

One of the interesting under currents of the movie is the well known hardiness of Japanese girls once they set their minds to get out there and do something for themselves. These are not the silly Japanese girls we read about on designer shopping sprees in in Europe - these girls in Hula Girl are on a mission and this true story is pretty inspiring.

And being from Hawaii, of course, I'm proud to know that this project (the center, not the film) actually accomplished what it set out to do.

The only thing I feel bad about for viewers who don't understand Japanese is that the Iwaki dialect is probably completely lost in translation for foreign audiences. It would be like watching ""Fargo"" with Japanese subtitles (and I have), where a lot of the subtlety comes as much from the local accent as from the words themselves; the Iwaki accent is easily as distinctive, and carries the same sense of rural innocence, as the exaggerated Minnesota accent employed by the Cohen brothers.  Key is a scene on the bus, as the troupe is heading towards a performance. The teacher, who is from Tokyo (and resolutely so), says a few words in what is clearly an Iwaki accent, indicating both the passage of time since she arrived, and her newfound willingness to let go of her urban identity and get closer to the girls she teaches.

This movie, the official entry from Japan for the 2007 Academy Awards' Best Foreign Film category (it didn't make the final cut), is a beautiful tearjerker.  It is unapologetic about it, and it does not pretend to be anything else.  You will shed tears alright, but they're of the cathartic kind.  The stuff that truly and thoroughly makes you feel good.  You know exactly what happens in the end, too, but the finale will NOT disappoint you, either.

Tearjerkers don't get any better than this one.  After a year of such dark, depressing movies as No Country for Old Men, There Will Be Blood, and Atonement, to mention a few, it is wonderfully refreshing to laugh and cry and feel good about all that at the end.

3180975,3,B000VS6Q7W,"""Hula Girls"" takes place in 1965 in a small mining town in northeastern Japan. Coal is becoming outdated, and the mine is gradually closing down. To try to keep the town alive, a ""Hawaiian Center"" is being built and staffed, a place where it is ""always summertime."" The center is recruiting hula dancers, which is the focus of the film. To help feed their families and change along with the changing times, several coal miners' daughters join up under the tutelage of a disillusioned pro dancer from Tokyo, who was trained in Hawaii.

The film was very sweet, uplifting and enjoyable, and I can see watching it again (but perhaps not again and again). It was, however, a little cliched, as it was very reminiscent of other films of this type, and at several points I was reminded of, in turn, Dirty Dancing, A League of Their Own (there was even a point where the teacher says that there is no crying allowed) or Billy Elliot.

The plot is also a little jumpy, and certain plot points are never played out. There is, for instance, the Tokyo teacher who almost instantaneously transforms from disillusioned drunk (even though we only see one episode of drunkenness) to tough-but-caring mentor. There is also a relationship between the teacher and one of the original dancers that ends up being very close and heart-rending, but we don't see how it got there - all of a sudden, the two are weeping and embracing, but we don't know why they are so attached. In contrast, the relationship between the teacher and Kimiko, one of the other original dancers and one of the stars of the film, is fully developed and logical.

Overall, however, these things can be overlooked if the viewer just expects this to be a feel-good, uplifting movie and nothing more. The acting is generally good (some actors are more subtle than others) and the dancing and costumes are a lot of fun!",1202601600,,1869,4.674772036474164

The '06 release `Hula Girls' which is based on an actual event is an absolutely exhilarating film that will immediately draw you into the storyline and have you rooting for the irresistible band of would-be hula girls from beginning to end. No wonder it won just about every major award in the '07 Japanese Academy Awards. I honestly cannot think of one negative thing to say about this production. It's dramatic, poignant, bittersweet and downright funny. The storyline is well conceived, the dialogue believable and the retro-Hawaiian soundtrack is in the perfect contrast to the drab landscape of the Japanese coal mining town where the new Hawaiian Center is being built.

This is a film I could watch over and over again and for me that's the bottom line in judging any film. By the way, did I forget to mention the charming and beautiful Aoi Yu in the role of Kimiko. I couldn't take my eyes off her, what an incredible smile!

3180977,4,B000VS6Q7W,"I rented this movie and will now buy it for my collection. It's listed as a comedy but it is anything but that.  It's more of a tear jecker drama which is why I recommend having tissue handy since it is the true story of a group of poor school girls who face an uncertain economic future and decide to join an Hawaiian dance troupe managed by an out of town (and out of place) ex-dancer.  Most of the movie covers a myriad of problems the girls must overcome to even put on the first show.  However the ending is spectacular and worth watching.  I highly suspect Hollywood will re-make this into an English version as was done with Masayuki Suo's ""Shall We Dance?"".  Might as well get a head start and watch the original Japanese version now, plus Yu Aoi is beautiful to see, especially once she dresses up as the Hula troupe lead dancer.",1201305600,,838,4.346153846153846

The central plot revolves around a group of girls that decide to become the resort's ""Hula Girls"". It is a sweet, touching story that is reminiscent of many other movies with similar themes (""Full Monty"", etc). The translation did seem a bit rough.

The movie won Japan's version of the Academy Award for Best Picture. It was an entertaining movie.",1200268800,,769,4.347222222222222
3180979,5,B000VS6Q7W,"Probably the biggest surprise of ""Hula Girls"", and what gives it such impact, is how it comes out of left field with its depth and emotion.  What appears to be a by-the-numbers feel good movie, about a bunch of fish-out-of-water types who aspire to something more, to the tune of ""Shall We Dance?"" or ""The Full Monty"", ends up being a brutal and violent tale, filled with prejudice and entrenched small town thinking.  This is ""Billy Elliot"".  This is ""Coal Miner's Daughter"".

Life is hard for coal miners, and during the mid-60s when demand for coal dropped off and the mines started closing, it became harsher still.  One of the lofty dreams of Japan at the time was the concept of life-time employment, where a company was your family and they looked after their employees faithfully.  Many such projects as the Joban Hawaiian Center were started at that time, attempting to replace vanishing industries with tourism and supplying new employment for company workers.  It was an admirable goal, rather than just discarding unneeded laborers to fend for themselves.  Most of the time it ended in failure, and the various ""Canada Lands"" and ""Holland Centers"" that populated the Japanese countryside are now all barren ruins.  The Hawaiian resorts still stands though, and the Hula Girls are still dancing.

Very loosely based on this true story, director Sang-il Lee artfully mixed the dull colors of the mining world with the bright promise of a better future in the flashing colors of Hawaii.  Korean-Japanese, Lee knows something about the harshness of attempting to bring new thoughts to a closed community, as he has shown in his first film ""Chong"".  He also understands the freedom and resilience of youth, having adapted Ryu Murakami's youth-rebellion novel ""69"". All of the actors shine as well, especially Yu Aoi as the lead dancer Kumiko.

Some of the appeal of ""Hula Girls"" will probably be lost on Western audiences, especially the performance of Shizuyo Yamazaki as the giant girl Sayuri.  Yamazaki is a famous comedian in Japan, known for her gruff manner and wearing guy's clothes, so seeing her dance around in a hula skirt is especially charming.  She also puts enormous depth into her character, something I didn't think she was capable of as an actress, and was quite moved by.",1199664000,35,2297,4.9453125

So many of the daughters of the coal miners get jobs as dancers to try to help the town.

3180981,3,B000VS6Q7W,"Having seen very few independent films in my life -- and never one that was Japanese -- I was looking forward to Hula Girls greatly.

Overall, the movie was entertaining. The premise -- young girls in a 1960s Japanese coalmining town take on the (til then) mysterious and vaguely scandalous art of hula dancing in order to save their laid-off families. The town hires Ms. Madoka Hirayama, a sophisticated ex-dancer from a prestigious Tokyo dance troupe, as the girls' instructor. Of course, it doesn't take long for the residents to wonder why someone would leave that sort of lifestyle for their plain, poor village...

As the girls begin to tackle the dancing -- which will be featured at the town's new Hawaiian Cultural Center, a desperate attempt to turn the town's fate -- they build and test friendships, struggle to gain approval from their traditional families, and learn what it takes to make it in the adult world.

However, it took a long time for the story to progress. Wanting to detail the girls' lives and allow viewers to fully appreciate their hardscrabble lives is understandable, but there were quite a few scenes that did absolutely nothing to progress the plot.

On the plus side, this DVD also comes with a myriad of bonus features, including a hula how-to and a bit about the real people on which the story is based.

On the whole, ""Hula Girls"" makes for an entertaining movie -- just don't set your expectations *too* high.",1199059200,,1448,4.776
3180982,5,B000VS6Q7W,"I was completely enchanted by this movie about growth and transformation, at the individual and community level.  A++++.  This movie tells the true story of how a bleak coal mining town transformed itself into a tropical resort destination (using natural hot springs in an otherwise decidedly untropical area) featuring hula dancers.

Like most stories of success against impossible/daunting odds, this one includes an appealing protagonist (the gorgeous Yu Aoi), a number of setbacks and obstacles, and a surly mentor and a community clinging to tradition and loath to change, who are both eventually won over by the hope and courage of a small group of dreamers.

Unlike most stories of success against impossible odds, this one is fascinating for its portrayal of small town Japanese life, for the particularly outstanding performances of its main characters, and for its wonderful glimpse into the world of hula dancing - an impressive art that I'm sure most of us have been exposed to in the most superficial of ways.

Enthusiastically recommended.

And, if you enjoy this movie, you might also enjoy Rocket Boys, about a West Virginia coal mining town and some of its high school students, who dream of science and space.",1198108800,,1227,5.11
3180983,5,B000VS6Q7W,"In 1965 Japan, a small coal mining town must find a new way of life to survive as oil replaces the industry, but the older residents aren't comfortable with change. The plan to open a Hawaii themed vacation resort to provide jobs meets with strong opposition, especially the main attraction in development, a troupe of hula dancers recruited from among the town daughters themselves. The girls, led by a jaded teacher brought in from the big city, will have to overcome their clumsy shyness and band together to move their community forward if they are going to keep their town alive.

One can't deny that ""Hula Girls"" is a kind of story we've seen before. It could be described well as a much less obnoxious ""A League of Their Own,"" only set in '60's Japan. Yes, it's about a group of people bonding and triumphing over adversity, and it's an emotional rollercoaster ride along the way. But, there's something about ""Hula Girls"" that gives it a bit more heart than most movies of this type that I have seen. There's also just something about it that seems more real and appealing. Perhaps this is a matter of personal taste. It might be as simple as preferring to watch such a film about hula dancing over one about football or some other jock sport. There's also the added foreign film flavor (yes, you have to read subtitles if you don't understand Japanese) that may be more interesting to some. Still, if you like this kind of film, this one is worth a trial view. You're sure to cry at least once, and you'll be in love with young star Yu Aoi by the end of the film who is quite the Tahitian dancer!

This 2-disc Special Edition from Viz Pictures is a lovely presentation. The film is anamorphic widescreen and looks and sounds great, and there are some really nice extras. Disc One includes previews for 6 other Japanese films, plus text bios of the cast and director. Disc Two includes the original Japanese trailers (no subtitles on these trailers though), plus an interview with the composer (who speaks fine English) and three subtitled featurettes. The first featurette is a making-of, the second is a very lengthy but wonderful look at the training for the Hula Girls from the film, and last is a featurette about the real-life Hula Girls the film was based on.

""Hula Girls,"" which also seems to go by the title ""Hula Girl,"" was the Best Picture winner at the 2007 Japan Academy Awards, and it took several other awards there and elsewhere as well. Perhaps it may be a bit too familiar and heartwarming for much of today's cynical American audience to feel such praise is justified, but there is just something special about this movie. It may be the outstanding cast or the many tearful moments, or maybe the fantastic dancing!",1198022400,,2742,4.637860082304527
3180984,3,B000VS6Q7W,"""Hula Girls"" surprised me.  I expected a feel good movie that I could play for the younger, less cynical members of my extended family during the holidays.  Instead I found myself enjoying the film far more than I expected I would.

The plot is relatively simple and one that is both familiar and predictable.  It is 1965 and a cold, dreary, Japanese coal mining community is in trouble. The coal mine is no longer profitable and mass layoffs are in the cards.  The mining company, in what appears to be a far fetched plan, decides to use the geothermal hot springs (that have plagued the mines for decades) as the centerpiece of a Hawaii-style resort community.  In other words, the town will be converted to a Disney-like sort of Hawaii, complete with Hula Girls.

The Hula Girls are to be recruited and trained from the community and the recruiting and training of the local girls forms the heart of the movie.  There is resistance from the community. Some parents don't like the idea of their girls wearing grass skirts and shaking their hips. Many just think the whole plan diverts attention from the plight of the miners.  Based on a true story, we follow the lives of the recruits, of the townsfolk, and of the somewhat troubled big-city professional dancer brought up from Tokyo to teach the girls how to Hula.

On the surface this sounds pretty hokey and contrived, yet another artificially touching ""feel-good cinema story of the year"" plot.  However, good acting, cinematography, and writing takes this movie beyond its clichd plot and the result is a feel-good movie that, well, made me feel good.  The two leads, the dance teacher Miss Hirayama and the star pupil Kimiko (played by Yasuko Matsuyuki and Yu Aoi) are believable characters and the development of their relationship is very well done.  You really do want them to succeed against all odds.
The special features, including the real story of the Hula Girls and interviews with the real characters at the heart of the story are a welcome addition to the cast.

There are two slight downsides to this movie for me.

Despite the good performances the very concept of the movie makes it difficult for the story to develop any tension as the plot plays itself out.  We know going in that things are likely to end up in a certain way and, for the most part, the viewer won't be disappointed

Second, I think one age group most likely to be absorbed and entertained by this movie are pre-teens.  However, Hula Girls is in subtitles (and I prefer subtitles to dubbing) and I'm not sure that a younger audience would be able to track the subtitles in pace with the movie.  A lot depends on the child's reading speed of course.  This may be one DVD where a dubbed option would really benefit the enjoyment of a younger audience.

All in all, the acting and film work in Hula Girls outweighs the pretty formulaic story line and this makes for a pretty enjoyable family viewing experience. Well worth a look.

I certainly want to celebrate Viz Media and their releases, and I would love to be able to lend them my editorial support so that they can continue bringing us Japanese cultural items.  I also happen to be a Japanologist myself, Japan is my primary area of study, and so I must constantly ask myself if I'm enjoying the product based upon the product itself and its merits, or if I'm only interested in it from the perspective of Japanese studies.

While Hula Girls is by no means a bad movie, it does fall into the popular cliche of taking a ""true"" story, something about a teacher or a coach, a group of (sometimes unwilling, or untalented) students, and turning it into a tear-jerker.

And it does have some interesting merits (which I won't spoil), and at its best, it even makes stabs in the direction of feminism and impresses with interesting cinematography and direction.  At its worst, sadly, it comes off as another sort of Dangerous Minds/Remember the Titans/The Mighty Ducks etc kind of movie, only this time set in Japan, and I think this is one formula that's been done to death, and probably done better.

The extras contained on the second DVD are fine, and if you enjoy the movie and are interested in it, you'll also enjoy the interviews and snippets and mini-documentaries they've included, though they did not convert me into any kind of ""fan"" of the film.  If I hadn't been reviewing the movie, I wouldn't have bothered with the extras.

As much as I'd actually like to recommend Hula Girls, I'm really unable to.  It's a decent film that many will find entertaining, but it has nothing to make it stand out.",1197417600,4,1674,4.590604026845638
3180986,5,B000VS6Q7W,"There have been lots of sports-themed movies dealing with characters who overcame obstacles and beat the odds to emerge successful. Having this type of movie based on Hula dancing was an interesting idea and my wife and I liked it very much.

You can read the Amazon description as well as the other reviews for a synopsis of the plot so I won't repeat it here.  What I'd like to say is that while predicatable (I don't think I am spoiling anything by telling you this is one of those feel-good movies), it was very well made, the acting was good, the characters likable, and it is also entertaining for the entire family. It's good, clean fun that grabs your attention and has you rooting for the girls to succeed in their Hula dancing endeavor.

What I also liked about the movie is the fact that there is no English dubbing, only English subtitles.  I hate how foreign movies are ruined by unnatural-sounding English voiceovers.  I don't understand Japanese but the tones and inflection in the voices makes it clear what the emotions are in the scene, and the subtitles seem to be done very well.  No ""engrish"" here!  I did notice, however, that the subtitles use ""ain't"" and other slang grammar quite frequently.  I took this to be a translation of the way the poor, comparatively less educated villagers spoke compared to their more learned city counterparts.

I've never been a fan of hula dancing but after watching this movie, I have to say I now have an appreciation of this art. The soundtrack for the movie is pretty good, also.  Don't expect it to be all or even mostly Hula music.

Like I said, it's a rather predictable movie but since the characters are so likable, things happen like you want them to happen and you feel good about it.  At least my wife and I did.  I think most people will, too.",1197158400,2,1812,4.538461538461538

In 1965 the Japanese coal mining town of Iwaki is facing disaster; coal mining is rapidly becoming unprofitable.  In order to survive, the Joban Kosan Corporation, owners of the mine, needs to find some other kind of business to do, and in keeping with the slogan ""One Mountain, One Family"", whatever they come up with needs to save the town and as many of the workers as possible, too.  Their truly cockamamie solution?  To make lemons out of lemonade by turning the geothermal springs they spend huge amounts of money pumping out of the mine into the basis for a Hawaiian-style resort and theme park, the first of its kind in Japan, with former mineworkers and their families providing as many of the workers as possible, most especially the resort's Hula dancers.  This is their story.

The reaction of the mine workers is barely restrained hostility, but to a handful of their daughters, this is their chance to seek out an alternate future to a short life of backbreaking labor and fingernails blackened with coal dust no matter how thoroughly they wash.  Sanae Kimura (Eri Tokunaga) and her best friend Kimiko Tanikawa (Yu Aoi), a widow with a small son, and a shy giantess whose coal miner father pushes her to try, make up the entire class awaiting Madoka Hirayama (Yasuko Matsuyuki) the imperious dancing teacher from Tokyo who shows up drunk, motion sick, and wondering just what the Hell she has let herself be talked into.  Nevertheless, overcoming an increasingly implausible mountain of obstacles she and her students, expanded eventually by economic desperation (later students volunteer even though they'd rather not dance naked and are quite relieved to be informed that they won't be stripping!), persevere until their final performance at the resort opening leaves you cheering and crying simultaneously.

If this sounds a little too corny, don't worry, riveting performances by one and all keep your disbelief suspended.  Etsushi Toyokawa as Kimiko's protective older brother Yojiro and Madoka's knight in coal dust encrusted armor and Junko Fuji as Kimiko's intolerant and intransigent widowed mother Chiyo are particularly strong.  Certain scenes will stay with me for a while: Madoka's disastrous arrival in (what she sees as) Hick Hell, Madoka marching into the men's bathhouse to expound her views to one of the miners over his having beaten up his daughter for secretly being one of her students (he survives the discussion... barely), her students convincing Madoka not to go through with leaving, Chiyo delivering a package to her estranged daughter and seeing her dance for the very first time, Chiyo pleading to borrow stoves to save the imported but now dying palm trees, Yojiro ""dealing with"" Madoka's tormentors, and of course their final, stunning performance that not only brought the extras to their feet but also a Hawaiian audience skeptical about the concept of Hawaiian-style anything, after viewing it at the Hawaii International Film Festival.

The DVD extras give some hints of why this movie works so well.  Clearly the actress dancers were more than a little awed by encountering the real people, particularly the real dance instructors, who lived the real story and by the idea of performing in front of the current class of professional dancers in the scenes shot on location at the resort.  You can almost see them becoming that original group of girls struggling to learn their dances and determined not to disappoint.  Remarkably, Eri Tokunaga, whose character is eliminated by circumstance part way through the movie, continues her dance practice and accompanies the cast to the resort location where she is shown rolling and wetting towels and doing anything she can think of to help her fellow cast members nail their on film performances, while they inspire themselves by doing the famous cheer offstage before going on.  The resulting performance is better than anything the director was expecting, as he admits, and after movie filming finishes Eri is called up on stage to dance the finale with the rest of the cast.

The extras also reveal, according to the real participants and as I suspected, that the obstacles to be overcome had been exaggerated considerably in the screenplay;  I already had my doubts about tragic mine accidents, debt collecting gangsters, fathers beating up their daughters, unrelenting community hostility, etc., etc., etc., ALL being true during that first incredible year, but the excellent performances delayed this reaction until after the movie was over.

This story so inspiring it inspired the actresses themselves to exceed expectations is not to be missed!",1197158400,6,5039,5.404336734693878
3180988,4,B000VS6Q7W,"Hula Girls tells the true story of how a few dedicated Japanese girls helped to save their coal-mining town from closure. While the underdog aspect of this story feels quite familiar, the uniquely Japanese characters, dialogue, mannerisms and setting make Hula Girls a one-of-a-kind movie experience. Casting is exceptional, with truly extraordinary performances played by the actress who plays the Hula teacher newly arrived to the small coal-mining town of Iwaki from Tokyo in 1965 and the girls who overcome family pressures to stay home rather than travel across Japan doing hula dance performances to entice Japanese tourists to come stay at the newly constructed Polynesian resort. With a somewhat slow start, the story really picks up once the dance lessons begin, after an initially bumpy start as prudish mores scare the first batch of potential dance girls away.

My favorite parts of Hula Girls were the dance scenes, and I found myself wishing there were more such scenes in the movie, as that's where the magical transformation for the characters took place and it's also the center of the film. Some scenes seemed a bit predictable and slow, with acting slightly remniscent of anime characters over-the-top emotional outbursts... but most of the dance scenes hit just the right tone, showing how the art of hula and an insistence on smiling and moving fluidly to tell stories with one's hands could lift a town's spirits and keep its community thriving and alive.

I was slightly disappointed with the special features disk, as some of the special features are entirely in Japanese with no English subtitles. I watched them anyway because it was fascinating to watch the real-life hula girls getting trained to dance the hula with the real life dance instructor in Iwaki.

I recommend Hula Girls for everyone who loves dance, hula, Japanese culture and stories of how it's possible to rise above all kinds of obstacles to make one's dreams come true.",1197158400,2,1964,5.055555555555555

Nicely shot with a period look of both the sixties style and glorious good old film, HULA GIRLS often wanders into what we' see in the west as cartoonish characterizations of dominantly, and dumbly, Japanese male role models in a crappy way-of-life on the decline. But beneath the often overplayed buffoonery of the men in the film -either morons or jerks or corporate shills- is a sweetly done film worthy of both praise and a wider audience. Great camera work and excellent editing; superb use of (lack of) color where needed plays well as the vibrance of colorful costu...oops, giving too much away.

So, can the girls learn the intricate moves of the hula, perform at the center and move above the filth of a mining life? You'll need to see it through yourself.

I thoroughly enjoyed this ""based on fact"" import from Japan. You can read the item description for a synopsis; I won't waste your time on that. That said, I am probably echoing what a lot of the other positive reviewers said & that should tell you something...but the performances were all first rate. Check out the list of awards on IMDB (all from Japan, of course). Matsuyuki and Aoi really deserved their nominations and wins.

It made me laugh and cry. Sure I would say that I knew roughly how it was going to turn out...but can't you say that about 99% of TV and 90% of movies made these days. It's the telling of the story that was so skillfully done by all involved and the glimpse into a portion of Japanese culture I had not had before that made this a film to watch.

My one beef is that there was an overuse of slow motion to highlight emotional moments in the last half hour of the film. It got a bit old.

This is a fine use of your entertainment dollar and time. The extras are great (which is, sadly not always the case). The interview with the actual people the movie is based on is fascinating.",1196985600,3,1295,4.295081967213115
3180991,4,B000VS6Q7W,"This winner of eight Japanese Academy Awards (including best screenplay, best director, and best actress) and a staple of many US film festivals, ""Hula Girls"" is the quintessential feel-good movie. Based on a true story and set in 1965, the film has all the requisite ingredients:  long odds, characters with spunk, big stakes,  and a balance of comic and tear-jerker moments

In the small, gritty town of Iwaki, the residents rely solely on the prosperity of the Joban mine.  The men plunge into the mines for rotating shifts while the women rake the coal debris on the surface.  When rumors circulate that the mine will be closed, thus devastating the entire town, the idea is born to make ""Hawaii"" and thus paradise in this cold, remote town in northern Japan.  And how can one have a Hawaiian resort without hula dancers?  Over the objection of parents and conservative members of the town, a band of young coalminers' daughters and one widow embark on getting the coal out from under their fingernails and putting the shake into their hips.  A down-and-out dance teacher from Tokyo is imported, and they all embark on saving their town from imminent collapse.  In a town so removed from the center of Japan that the locals speak Korean, the hula girls must transform from ""country bumpkins"" into graceful dancers, something no one believes is possible.

The two stars of this film, Yasuko Matsuyuki (Ms. Hirayama) and Yu Aoi (the star dancer Kimiko), deliver complex and riveting performances, although they are supported by fine acting all around.  Aoi, in particular, glows whenever on screen, and her final performance of a Tahitian dance is simply explosive.  Lee Sang-il (69, SCRAP HEAVEN) directs with authority, and cinematographer Yamamoto (The Grudge) captures the bleakness of the coal mine and the vibrancy of dance.  Without such talent bringing the screenplay to life, this would be just another film about underdogs.

The DVD special features are somewhat interesting: interviews with the two women on whom the main characters were based; a short clip about the training the women received; an interview with soundtrack composer Shimatukuro; and information about making the movie.

Even so, I think it's a really good one to watch on a dreary day when you're feeling self-pitying and have a huge tub of popcorn in front of you.  It has a lot of humor, a lot of heart, and a lot of well-choreographed hula dancing.

3180993,4,B000VS6Q7W,"""Hula Girls"" is an enchanting film, based on a true story, and it won the Japanese equivalent of the Best Picture Oscar.  Set in a northern Japan coal-mining town in the mid-1960's, it dramatizes the efforts of a group of young women to become hula dancers for a Hawaiian-themed amusement center.  Even though it is presented as a way to generate revenue for the town, many of the residents resist its development, even as many of them are being laid off. The film centers on Kimiko, a charming young woman who sees this as her ticket out of a mine-related career in her small town.  The instructor who is hired, Ms. Hirayama, arrives drunk and disillusioned and deems hopeless the task of teaching these ""bumpkins"" how to dance. But, as one would expect from this type of film, the girls get better and overcome adversity, the instructor has a change of heart, and everything leads up to the big-show finale.  The script has many other predictable elements of the ""underdogs-triumph"" film: the parents who don't understand, or even, in Kimiko's case, disown her; the ""ugly-duckling"" dancer; the tragedy that lies in wait in the midst of triumph, etc.  That said, this movie rises above the formula with strong performances, especially from Y Aoi (Kimiko), Yasuko Matsuyuki (Ms. Hirayama) and Junko Fuji (Kimiko's mother Chiyo); and with some captivating hula dance sequences, especially, of course, the crowd-pleasing finale.

3180994,5,B000VS6Q7W,"What is the liklihood that a remote mining town in northeast Japan can reverse its downhill economic course by getting a dance teacher from Tokyo to teach hula dancing to local girls to help generate revenue for the town's recovery via the Joban Hawaiian Center? Well, that is what happened in the town of Iwaki. Due to what many viewed as a hair-brained scheme, unlikely circumstances brought success back to this former mining town in this sensitive and heart-warming film.

The film takes place in 1965, the initial scene is a stark hill, built from the dirt removed from the mine. There Kimiko and her good friend Sanae discuss their interest in learning the hula dance to join the local Joban Hawaiian Center. Both apply and are accepted. Kimiko's mother is dead set against her daughter dancing half-naked on stage. In anger, Kimiko moves out to the dance center to follow her dream of becoming a professional dancer. There is a comical scene in which Ms Hirayama the dance teacher arrives to this humble mining town ... in a motorized cart when the real transportation breaks down. The country miners stare at this attractive female who is dressed in her fine city clothes, wearing her signature sunglasses. It is a hilarious scene. The dance auditions are well done. The film  focuses on four main dancers, Kimiko, Sanae, a housewife, and a tomboy named Sayuri. From their stiff postures and movements it is quite evident Ms Hirayama has her work cut out for her. She begins teaching basic dance moves and builds their skills and confidence. The scene where the girls first try on their costumes and shake their hips in grass skirts superbly contrasts their newly acquired skills with their previous efforts. The locals are skeptical that a dance center will have any impact on their circumstances ...

Once the dance troupe had learned several Hawaiian dances, they were taken on tour to nearby venues to perform. At one stop, the audience, mostly men, was anticipating a ""girlie"" type dance show. At first, they cheered but later booed after learning the program was not what they expected. Performances at other locations proved quite successful. Enthusiasm for the Iwaki Hawaiian dancers grows. The manager of the dance troupe had even imported palm trees to authenticate the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the cold weather threatened the survival of these exotic plants. A supporter of the project asked for donations of heaters and stoves to create a hot climate to help the trees endure the cold front. Amazingly, Kimiko's mother, Chiyo became one of the most ardent supporters of this plan. She realized her whole life revolved around the coal mining industry which was a harsh existence. It dawned on Chiyo that Kimiko's plan to dance provided her a great escape from this lifestyle.

The film has various subplots which include different characters whose lives were touched deeply by learning hula dancing and becoming a member of the local dance troupe. The film takes disparate elements and builds a fascinating film from the incongruity. The film shows how one man with a seeming impossible dream built a successful enterprise which eventually became famous throughout Japan. With enthusiastic energy and hard work, unskilled country girls were transformed into a beautiful authentic Hawaiian dance troupe. The originally skeptics became a unified community, who helped the dancers make an impossible dream come true.

This DVD has enhanced features with interviews of real dancers who participated in the original dance troupe created at the Joban Hawaiian Center. The center was later converted into a spa and resort. There is  an interview with the original hula dance teacher who taught the country girls of Iwaki how to dance. The role of Ms Hirayama was created based on this real life example. It is easy to understand why this film won a Japanese Academy Award.

Being a guy, I like seeing pretty girls dance the hula, however I think it would have been a boring film if it was just about group of girls learning to dance. The story is more about a town (and in particular) a group of young ladies struggling with the changes that were being forced upon them.

3180997,5,B000VS6Q7W,"Based on a true story, Hula Girls is a real charmer of a film. It won the equivalent of the Japanese Academy awards and it is quite a feel-good film.

The story is based on the story of a mining town in a remote prefecture of Japan. The mine is closing, leaving the workers without any employment. The mine engages in a really dicey venture, to open a hot spring with a Hawaiian theme. Seems the mine is constantly filling up with hot water from a local hot spring, so the idea is to use the water to fill the spa and forget about mining coal. Coal was being replaced by (cheap) oil. Times were changing.

The town brings in Ms. Hirayama as professional hula teacher, a gal with a shady past. She is none too thrilled to be teaching the local coalminers' daughters. She shows up stinkin' drunk, not a good omen, and soon her gangster nemesis follows, chasing her for her mother's presumed gambling debts. But somehow, she connects with Sanae and Kimiko, and eventually more girls show up to become professional dancers.

The rest of the film is about the development of the spa and the resistance of the old-timers to the changes. This could be filmed anywhere, Poland, West Virginia. But there is a happy ending despite the changing times.

The film director wisely chose to let the dancing speak for itself at the end and we are treated to most of the Hula show, which is a real treat. Many directors would have just had a cut or two, but we get most of the show at the end, which was a delight. Everyone cries, and maybe you will too. This is a delightful film.

The film reminded me most of Chris Eyre's film Edge of America, about a group of young Native American girls who find themselves playing women's basketball.

While the film is very conventional in style and editing and storytelling approach -- so much that it evokes the innocence of an earlier period of filmmaking -- it looks very good on this dvd.  The color scheme of the film to begin with feels washed out and drab, both evoking the period it depicts and suggesting the drabness of a coal town.  Almost the only vibrant colors you see are those of the costumes on the Hula Girls -- but when they begin to develop confidence it seems as though, subtly, the tone even of the city becomes warmer, as if the vibrancy of their outfits and their dancing were spreading into the town.  The acting, if occasionally a bit over the top and melodramatic, is consistent throughout and convincing on the whole.  (The dancing is very impressive.)

The story focuses on Kimiko, whose family rejects her for her decision to become a Hula girl.  Local prejudice, longstanding tradition, and fear of change, all form obstacles to the development of the center.  Of course, there is no doubt where the story will end, with reconciliations and triumph and tears.  While this a film that is unafraid to wear its heart on its sleeve, it is so sincere in its melodramatic presentation of the trials and triumphs and the vulnerability and hopes of the young girls, that it would be hard not to get caught up in the emotion and excitement of the story and to forgive the filmmakers a few digressions and a few moments that push melodrama a bit too far.  There are genuinely touching moments in this film -- moments you want to cheer and moments you'd want to cry, moments that are sentimental but in which the sentiment does not feel forced.  There are also a few moments that go a bit over the top -- as in the whole story of a miner who takes on the responsibility of caring for the exotic trees of the Hawaii Center, and who seems almost to fall in love with one tree in particular, who cries over its failing health.  The film does fall prey to stereotypes and cliches -- the gruff miners, the disapproving mother, the reluctant teacher who rises to the occasion, etc.  And there are a few storylines that seem like digressions and really go nowhere -- but, I guess, life is like that.  In spite of cliches, predictable turns, occasionally mawkish sentimentality, the film as a whole works because it is so sincere and straightforward and consistent.  Like the plucky young dancers who try to wear a smile even when things are at their worst, the film almost dares you to dismiss it.  In the end, I found myself moved.  On the whole, this is a worthy and sincerely told story and a nice celebration of several young women and their teacher, who achieved something remarkable against the odds and who established a legacy that remains today in Japan.

This dvd set includes not only the film but also several informative documentaries on Hula dancing, on the history of the Hula girls, and on the making of the film.",1195603200,2,3838,4.570802919708029

8219648,5,B000VS6Q7W,"I agree with all the positive reviews for Hula Girls, one of my all time favorites. I wish I could get a copy.

The only thing I can add is that most of the reviews don't comment on the hula dancing and music, which are excellent.  Jake Shimabukuro's sound track CD is an exceptional complementary aspect for this movie, since many of the tracks were not used in the movie and add richness to the movie's story.",1463702400,,411,4.324675324675325

This is kind of the perfect movie. Great acting, sweet characters,and an adorable plot. It's in turns humorous and touching. The fact that it's based in a true story makes it even more engaging. They actually spent months before filming teaching the girls how to dance correctly. So wonderful. Fun to watch with lots of heart.",1421712000,,502,4.715909090909091
