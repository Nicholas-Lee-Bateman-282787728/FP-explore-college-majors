6448318,5,B00KU3Y35U,"This is just a miracle! Finally the COMPLETE series of DENVER the Last Dinosaur. This is a quality release here. Interviews and extras galore! The best quality of the show you will ever find. Someone must have heard all the fans whining over this show never obtaining a proper release , but now it's here! It's a great HD quality restoration of the original master recordings. This is the official product released by World Event Productions not some bootleg knock off. This set contains all 50 episodes. I was even surprised to find a nice booklet inside to follow along with. It's an episode guide that puts the show in proper order and gives you a brief description of each episode.

This is a great show featuring familiar 80's and 90's voice actors including the guy who did the voice for Michealangelo from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This show was a hit in the 90's. Every day after school I would come home and watch it. World Event Productions had another hit I loved too , Voltron, but everyone knows about that show.

I would highly recommend this for kids of all ages esp. 5 - 11 and up. You could actually be entertained by this as an adult too , esp. if you watched it in the 90's or reruns in the 2000's.

This collection comes packed with 6 discs. Over 25 Hours of running time. They also included an extra 7 episodes of some other cartoons by World Event Productions.

I'll be entertaining myself and children with this for quite a while.

*My friend who is a conspiracy theorist suggested some connection between Denver airport and perhaps a buried Dinosaur under there? Weird stuff goes on there I guess, but I thought that was funny enough to share.",1412121600,8,1671,4.556666666666667

8661677,3,B00KU3Y35U,"Sometimes nostalgia blinds us and prevents us from seeing substandard things from our childhood for what they are, but sometimes we remember things correctly. For example, as a kid, I had my parents rent (what was apparently just) the pilot episode of Denver, the Last Dinosaur over and over again, mostly because I liked the theme song. The cartoon was pretty bland, even by cheap 80s and 90s cartoon standards, with incredibly stereotypical characters delivering after-school special-style lessons under the pretext of having a dinosaur for a best friend. Denver, the Last Dinosaur can never really be considered good, its just silly and predictably safe, but for most parents thats exactly what they want for their kids.

Theres no real overarching concept to be had here, but it boils down to the discovery of a gigantic dinosaur egg (sitting out in the open in a tar pit park) by a group of friends who quickly befriend the creature that emerges from it moments later. They name him Denver, because why not, and then they have some wild and crazy adventures while keeping Denver away from the authorities or greedy millionaires who want Denver for display purposes. Each episode brings a new adventure around town as the kids skateboard and bike from place to place as they get Denver in and out of trouble. The premise for the cartoon goes as far as some kids befriend a dinosaur and everything after that is just filler. Also, lets make the dinosaur play guitar and wear sunglasses, because thats what kids responded to in the 80s and 90s. I will neither defend that choice nor attempt to justify it.

Dinosaurs playing guitar, wearing sunglasses, and occasionally skateboarding  thats all you need to entertain any 6-year-old going through their dinosaur phase. Hence why Denver, the Last Dinosaur only lasted for as many episodes as it did (50 over two seasons), but even that seems like far more than it would take to exhaust the premise.

DVD Bonus Features

Three interviews with the company that produced the cartoon are the primary extras, though 7 additional, random cartoons are probably the extras that will interest the kids (and possibly draw them further down the 80s cartoon rabbit hole).
