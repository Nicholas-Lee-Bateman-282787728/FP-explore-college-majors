8110100,5,B000EHQU4E,Great to learn about jazz and do something new.  Mr. Hatchett appears to be a wonderful teacher and I wish I could take more lessons from him.,1441152000,,142,4.2592592592592595
8110101,5,B000EHQU4E,"I am a dance teacher. Spent many hours in a studio with Frank Hatchett. Thanks to Amazon, I am able to bring that class to MY students. ALL Jazz dance students should know his name, his ultra cool class room management, and basic JAZZ.  Thank-YOU, Amazon.com.",1377993600,2,259,4.630434782608695
8110102,3,B000EHQU4E,"Like other previous reviews have said...definitely not for beginners. The dvd has 3 dance routines that are fun and energetic. I danced when I was younger for about a year and 15 years later I want to join an adult class. I thought this dvd would be good to teach me some basics and fun routines before I make a fool of myself at a dance studio. The breakdown of the dance is fast with little instruction and it is only repeated once before moving to the next 16 counts and if you aren't familiar with dance terminology then forget about it. For a beginner the instructor does not break it down enough to learn the steps correctly and on the right count. Also this  is nearly impossible to do on carpet and make sure you have lots of space. I'm not totally writing these dances of yet, i'll revisit this dvd later once i have some technique under my belt.",1318550400,3,855,4.3105590062111805
8110103,2,B000EHQU4E,"The instructor is clearly a master of his work, however, until you're very familiar with the dance terminology and correct performance of key moves, you're not ready for this DVD.",1207353600,10,179,5.0
8110104,4,B000EHQU4E,"Okay, I did the Afro-Jazz routine last night.  This is definitely not a class for beginners.  First, he teaches the routine in segments with 2 students, without music and then with music.  The students are facing away from you so that it seems like you are in the back of the class, facing the mirror.  Just like in a real class.  I liked that part. No warm-up or cool down, just routines. The instruction is fast.  Did I say fast!  Super fast for me. AND if you are not familiar with dance terminology, you will be lost, I mean completely lost.  Don't think that the teacher is going to break down chasse or pas de bouree (sp) or tendu. because if you don't know ballet terms, forgetaboutit.

The routine is fun and fast.  It ends with a fall to the floor.  Sort of like if someone shot you and you fell stretched out on your side.  I could not get this routine.  It will take many stops and rewinds.  It takes him 15 minutes to teach it and 2 run thrus at the end.  By the way, if you have carpet, don't get this DVD.  You can not do turns on carpet. Yes I said turns, and leaps.

I've taken classes at Broadway Dance and the classes are labelled basic, beginnger, intermediate, and advanced.  Their beginner classes are really slow intermediate classes.  So you have been warned.  Don't think that this is easy, because it is not.  Fun, I guess so once you get it. I have a long way to go.",1169424000,27,1392,4.236641221374046
8110105,5,B000EHQU4E,"This is a great DVD.  There are three routines, each a different style.  I am a beginning dancer and I loved the routines.  I have learned so much! Yes, I  had to repeat over and over but that is beauty of doing it at home.  The music is good.  The directions are good and fun.  I highly recommend this one!",1159056000,10,307,4.016666666666667
