However, he thrilled with the set.  It is better to watch a video of Hogan's swing than to read about it.",1347926400,3,258,4.019607843137255
2829103,5,B000Q1JY2I,"I was really interested in the specifics of Mr Hogans swing, and these DVD'S have really helped me to understand and visualize his mastery of the game of golf. I believe that what I have learned from this collection will aid me in my own game .  Sicerely Keth Bernhagen",1324080000,,269,4.38
2829104,5,B000Q1JY2I,This is a great buy for those looking to better understand Ben Hogan and his swing secrets.  There are many well respected golfers and people who knew been personally that went into making this product.  Great buy!,1280707200,,214,4.756756756756757
2829105,5,B000Q1JY2I,"The Collection got here quickly and in excellent shape.

If I need anything else from this seller, I would defiantly buy from again.

2829106,5,B000Q1JY2I,This DVD Collection is phenomenal...There is so much miss information about Hogan's golf swing out there...What I love about McLean is that he learned from the guys that actually played with Hogan....this is just a great set of dvds...I recommend this to anyone that loves Ben Hogan or just golf in general..really great stuff!,1259452800,2,327,5.074074074074074
2829107,4,B000Q1JY2I,"This collection contains some terrific footage of Hogan at various times in his career and some excellent analysis of his swing by Jim McLean. The collection is far from ""complete,"" however. I was disappointed that more footage of interviews with Hogan was not included in the piece on Hogan's life and career. It would also have been nice to see video of Hogan's own attempts to teach important points of the swing. Some of this footage has appeared on YouTube: specifically, the footage of an elegant Hogan talking about the importance of the lower body in the golf swing; the footage from the Ed Sullivan show when Hogan demonstrated his training exercise; and the private footage from Florida when Hogan makes an interesting point about his right-hand grip; but it would have been great to see that footage collected here as well.",1253318400,8,834,4.880281690140845
2829108,4,B000Q1JY2I,"The video footage is old, sometimes not very clear, but it is good nonetheless.  The comments from the main commentator are good, but the guy is not a smooth speaker, perhaps he should have rehearsed more.  He does know a lot about golf swing fundamentals. Some of the other commentators had some strange useless comments that should not have made the final cut.  One guy that actually was good got cut off too soon; I could tell he had some useful ideas; maybe he has a DVD.
This is an excellent companion to Hogan's ""5 Lessons"" book.  Watching Hogan clarifies some things I had misunderstood from reading ""5 Lessons"".
The footage is repeated at normal and slow speeds, which is nice because Hogan had a fast body movement.  I am happy with the purchase, and I haven't even got to the software CD yet.",1246752000,8,802,4.541666666666667
2829109,5,B000Q1JY2I,"ok ok ben was the best... but what is amazing is that his swing is still copied by many golfers... in fact a good swing is out of temporality... and all the guys speaking here add something to this great and respectable man... Ben Hogan... Jim McLean helps to see and to understand his swing... ""thanks Jim... another one would have spoiled the mood... you lighten it up !"" After viewing the 3 cds, I'm definitely a Ben Hogan fan !",1190419200,8,431,4.333333333333333
2829110,5,B000Q1JY2I,"This DVD collection is for serious golf geeks.  It is full of film loops of the legendary Ben Hogan swinging various clubs, accompanied by breathless commentary by Jim McLean, a renowned golf instructor in his own right.  If you are a student of the golf swing, or a beginner determined to get it right, this is for you.  Hogan was one of the greatest golfers of all time and literally wrote the book on the golf swing:  Five Lessons - The Modern Fundamentals of Golf.

This is a great accompaniment to Five Lessons.  Hogan's book is a classic, and arguably the greatest golf instruction book ever written, but there are limitations to what you can express in words and two-dimensional drawings, and the footage in this DVD set fills those gaps.  Buy the DVD set and the book together to create the ideal at-home golf instructional course.",1185148800,22,839,4.666666666666667
2829141,5,B000Q1JY2I,"This is an excellent set of DVDs on the golf swing of Ben Hogan.  This is the best I've ever seen.  Very helpful in understanding the golf swing of Ben Hogan, the greatest ball striker ever.",1405382400,,190,4.25
2829142,5,B000Q1JY2I,This is really well put together - The software alone is worth the price just to watch the swings in slow motion and frame by frame (there are 3x swings to choose from) Match this up with the 5 lessons and Power Golf books and you are on your way to learning Golf from a Master Jedi....,1395878400,2,286,4.035087719298246
2829143,4,B000Q1JY2I,"Hogan's swing broken down in great detail. It was clearly the result of his personal trial and error rather than any ""secret"" discovery. His tendencies coupled with the physical limitations caused by the auto accident led him to find moves that worked for him. The principles are timeless but the swing is not one for amateurs to hope to copy.",1379203200,,343,4.733333333333333
2829144,5,B000Q1JY2I,"What a privilege it is to view Mr. Hogan's swings.  Watching this series while reading his book, Five Fundamental Lessons, is a real education and initiation into the mysteries of the golf swing.  This video is a must for any serious student of the game.",1376092800,,254,4.622222222222222
2829145,3,B000Q1JY2I,This was not I expected. I think Jim McLean is very overrated and thinks he is the greatest. But I love Ben Hogan.,1372204800,,114,4.0
2829146,5,B000Q1JY2I,"Years ago I purchased the McLean VHS on Ben Hogan. I liked it very much. But this re-do of it is amazing. The information is not tedious, short enough to be able to glean lots about Mr Hogan's swing mechanics. Very , Very informative.  It's a must Have.",1370390400,3,253,4.270833333333333
2829147,4,B000Q1JY2I,"The video presentation of ""perserverence""!  A lovely languid swing and a great story. Thanks to those who contributed to making this available by participating.",1363737600,2,160,5.666666666666667

2829149,5,B000Q1JY2I,One of the greatest golfers that ever lived.  Really enjoying the dvd set.  Well worth the cost if you are a Hogan fan.,1355529600,,119,4.130434782608695
2829150,5,B000Q1JY2I,"This DVD set is absolutely the best and most efficient way to study the movements of the best ball striker ever, Ben Hogan! While the collection consists of three disks plus a 4th bonus disk, the most helpful disc is the Bonus Disk because you can load it on to your computer and then observe frame by frame or in super slow motion the simplicity and awesome repeatability of Mr. Hogan's swing.

Viewing Mr. Hogan's swing frame by frame uncovers a FUNDAMENTAL movement in the golf swing that I believe has been overlooked for years. Although, in the past PGA professionals such as Tom Watson, Jack Nicklaus, Mark O'Meara, Nick Faldo, Jim McLean, David Leadbetter, Jimmy Ballard as well as Mr. Hogan himself, have all referred to forearm rotation, no one has emphasized this movement to the extent it should be emphasized.

This is especially true given my opinion that a unitized forearm rotation is an absolute true fundamental in the golf swing and is as important a fundamental as is the grip, as is the setup and as is the sequencing of movements.

While many experts have speculated as to what Mr. Hogan's swing secret actually was, no one has speculated that his secret might have been the unitized rotation of his forearms during the takeaway, backswing and follow through.

Of all the modern players, believe it or not, Brandt Snedeker, who just won the 2012 FedEx cup, together with the Tour Championship and who is also a captains' pick on this year's 2012 Ryder Cup team, executes this forearm rotation more conspicuously than anyone else on tour. The next time you see on TV the slow motion version of Mr. Snedeker's swing, be sure to observe how pronounced his forearm rotation is during the sequencing of his golf swing. You will especially see how noticeable his forearm rotation is during his takeaway sequence.

Jason Dufner would be another PGA Player who clearly executes a unitized forearm rotation, and is especially noticeable during his waggling of the club.

Be sure to watch the Ben Hogan Collection's ""bonus disk"" closely. Then frame by frame you will see that Mr. Hogan noticeably rotates his forearms in unison, (Hogan does not rotate his wrists or upper arms - just his forearms). You will see this forearm rotation very clearly in Mr. Hogan's waggle at Address. You will see during the backward sequence of his waggle that his left and right forearms are rotating clockwise and in unison. Then during the execution of his forward waggle you will see that both of his forearms are rotating counter clockwise and in unison.

It is this unitized rotation of the forearms during the takeaway, backswing and follow through that I believe is the true secret of the golf swing. This unitized and sequential rotational movement of the forearms is a true fundamental of the golf swing because it has the effect of neutralizing the arms and hands, so that it becomes easy and comfortably natural for the chest, back, shoulders, hips and legs to move correctly during the swing. The activation of all these large muscles then becomes the power force of the swing.

Without this unitized forearm rotation, the small muscles in the hands and arms will become the power source. In other words, to activate the large muscles you must FIRST NEUTRALIZE the influence of the hands and arms. A UNITIZED FOREARM ROTATION AUTOMATICALLY NEUTRALIZES THE HANDS AND ARMS. With the hands and arms both neutralized, the player can readily activate the large muscles in his or her back, chest, shoulders, hips and legs. WITHOUT THIS UNITIZED NEUTRALIZATION, IT WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY PLAYER TO ENGAGE AND ACTIVATE HIS OR HER LARGE MUSCLES!

Although I am stressing how important the unitized forearm rotation is, remember that you want the swing powered by the large muscles in the chest, shoulders, hips and legs - and all of these muscles will perform properly if allowed to perform properly through executing the unitized rotation of the forearms during the takeaway, backswing and follow through.
