7858291,5,6303984185,"I would truly like to see the return of Desperado ... the series of movies, that is.  I agree this is a great western ... very authentic to the times and not a ""silver screen hero"" shoot -em up who gets the girl in the end.  Alex MacArthur did a very convincing job.
I also would like to find the others in the series ... especially the first one.",1077408000,9,347,4.0144927536231885
7858292,5,6303984185,ALEX MCARTHUR MADE SEVERAL OF THESE MOVIES FOR TELEVISION AND THEY WERE ALL VERY GOOD WESTERNS.  FOR ANY WESTERN MOVIE FAN THEY ARE REALLY GOOD IN MY OPINION.  I AM 70 YEARS OLD AND BELIEVE ME WHEN I WAS A KID I SAW PLENTY OF CLASS B WESTERNS AND THIS IS DEFINATLY A CLASS A ACT.  THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE MOVIES MADE FOR TELEVISION AND I WOULD LIKE TO FIND ALL OF THEM.,1009756800,20,377,3.9342105263157894
