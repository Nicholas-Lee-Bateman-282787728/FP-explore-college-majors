7901909,4,630409096X,"Pay no attention to the review ""Aweful"" from the ""customer"" who cannot even spell Awful...his lack of specifics and vague hate lead me to think he did not even watch the tape (or understand it's purpose).

The first reviewer is correct, these are beginner level tricks using commonly found or household objects. Even though the props/tricks are simple, they still can entertain, but tricks themselves do not entertain-that has to come from the performer. Bob explains the workings in detail, but I wish the tape was available as DVD as the image would be much clearer and the the segments would be easier to ""rewind"".

You may remember Bob from his kids show Wonderama, but he was also an accomplished magician. He received the ""Magician of the Year "" award from the Society of American Magicians.",1237248000,,797,4.852941176470588
7901910,4,630409096X,"First, note well: This video is for people who are beginning magic enthusiasts, or perhaps (like myself) just wanted to learn a bit of sleight-of-hand to entertain the church youth group with.  Mind also:  This is not a big-budget production.  The important element of the video  lies in the information.  As such, I was able to learn several tricks and  perform them successfully: Disappearing quarters, salt shakers, broken  rubber bands, and my favorite, a card trick called ""Cactus Pete, King  of the Card Sharps.""  McAllister's amiable personality makes it  enjoyable to watch.  The only drawbacks, again, are the low-budget  production values.  I'd highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn  some basic tricks and gain some confidence in doing them.  The tricks are  simple, yet appealing.",946339200,11,803,5.253968253968254
