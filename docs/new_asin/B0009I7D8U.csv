8061063,5,B0009I7D8U,"HULA GIRLS..An outdoor event of professional tahitian dancers. Men doing their warrior dancers. And the girls performing their hip swinging hula. They are performing on dirt ground at night time, the lighting was not as powerful as what outdoor concert lighting is, but then i have to remember that this is the Pacific Islands and i saw the full concert very well. The men put on a great display danceing with flameing torches. And all the girls looked very colorful as they came out and danced in red grass hula skirts, they really moved their hips, and how were they able to move their hips so fast? Amazeing. Later on in the concert the Tahitians would choose tourists to come and join them in there danceing too. But you must always wait to see if you get asked. I was in Tahiti years ago, it was a very beautiful exotic island. A wonderful concert by the Tahitian dancers. I would recommend this DVD to everyone who is interested in Pacific Island Dance.",1335830400,2,959,4.5813953488372094
