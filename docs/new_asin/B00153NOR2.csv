3515419,4,B00153NOR2,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --I have to confess, I didn't laugh a whole lot during the first episode or two of Snuff Box (save for a hilarious little musical interlude about rapping with babies), as the show's rhythms took some getting used to and the humor certainly relies more on absurdity than on traditional punch lines. The actual jokes that are initially introduced aren't that remarkable in and of themselves, but Snuff Box somehow manages to make these mediocre jokes increasingly entertaining through the process of repetition. For instance, there's a little gag early on in which Matt spends a couple of minutes flirting with a pretty girl. However, at the second she mentions she has a boyfriend, he shouts an obscenity at her and engages in an act of minor destruction. It's chuckle-worthy at best, but somehow the joke gets funnier with each passing episode as Matt's behavior escalates (smashing a coffee mug is one thing; throwing a puppy across a parking lot is another).

Many of the gags are like that; long-form jokes that build steam over the course of the entire series. Also along these lines: Rich's trips back to the year 1888 (where Matt's ancestor offers him a variety of prostitutes to choose from on each occasion), Matt's visits to an ominous retail store (which always end in a beating of some sort), meetings of the British Board of Censors (in which the board laughs heartily at grotesque material until it goes just one notch too far) and Rich's insistence on ruining the punchlines of Matt's jokes. Weaved around all these familiar (and almost always increasingly enjoyable) routines are conventional sitcom storylines which are dealt with in anarchically unconventional ways: Matt and Rich's younger brothers come to visit, Rich steals Matt's diary, Matt searches for the true identity of Rich's mother, and so on.

The repeated sketches and consistent framework (the show always opens with the pair having a conversation in a long white hallway, and always closes with an impromptu performance of the catchy series theme song) go a long way toward preventing the series from feeling like nothing more than Berry and Fulcher simply throwing whatever ideas pop into their heads on the screen for our consumption. Stepping back and taking a larger view of the series, one can appreciate the impressively intricate construction of the show; its tics, catchphrases, recurring characters and seemingly random outbursts of weirdness have been arranged like a remarkable piece of dirty, whiskey-soaked clockwork. It's not quite as consistently entertaining as some of the other stuff Berry and Fulcher have been associated with, but it's probably the most ambitious endeavor of both gentlemen's careers.

The series looks okay on DVD, though there are some portions of the show that are seemingly supposed to look rather shoddy. Detail isn't great and there's some color bleeding at times, but nothing which renders the disc ugly or unwatchable. Audio is also sturdy enough, with the music (mostly written by Berry and a consistent highlight of the show) coming through with strength and dialogue sounding fairly clean. A generous amount of supplements have been packed onto the disc along with all six episodes: three audio commentaries, a fun supply of celebrity-heavy featurettes (""Taking Control of Your Body,"" ""Locations Walking Tour,"" ""The Score,"" ""Inside the Snuff Box,"" ""Testimonials""), some outtakes and a bonus CD featuring music from the show.

Note: Though the series isn't rated, Snuff Box is most assuredly R-rated material. You'll be treated to violence, sex, nudity, copious amounts of swearing and some rather nauseating gross-out images. Those who prefer their comedy a little gentler should consider themselves warned.

The first time I watched this I thought ""This is pretty good stuff"".  Then I started showing it to friends... by the third time I watched the series I realized what I thought was bronze was most defiantly gold.

The comedy is dark and surreal, the content mature, and music is genius.

It offers up a full, enveloping world that feels strange but makes one feel completely at home.  In this reality all of these situations make sense and time can naturally shift about. Each false advert seems to be plucked out of this other universe.  The reoccurring music throughout the series really ties everything together and gives it even more of a trippy feel.

As a huge fan of Matt Berry's music, I was beyond excited to see that a companion soundtrack cd is actually included. It's all I could wish for.
Describing this show in a way that does it justice is nigh impossible (though admittedly those posting before me have done an excellent job), so I suggest to just watch it with an open mind and hopefully with a taste for British sketch comedy, as Berry and Fulcher dare to take you on a personal journey.",1421798400,5,753,4.2

3515449,4,B00153NOR2,"Question: What is ""Snuff Box""? Is it a black comedy? A time-traveling sci-fi show? A string of bizarre sketches and musical numbers?

Answer: It's all of the above. This weird little British comedy pairs the wildly underrated Matt Berry with the somewhat less charismatic Rich Fulcher, and follows their wacky adventures involving sex, family, murder and time travel. At times it can be annoyingly juvenile (oh look, pee jokes), but the overall experience is a warped, almost hallucinatory comedy about a very unhealthy friendship. It's one of those glorious shows that simply glides by on the actors.

Matt Berry (yes, they use their real names) is High Executioner to the King of England, and Rich Fulcher is his faithful assistant. When they aren't casually knocking people off their mortal coil, they hang out at a gentlemen's club which caters exclusively to hangmen -- and Rich discovers that the men's room leads to a time portal into the past, where he regularly meets Matt's sorcerous ancestor (Berry again) and frolics with prostitutes.

They also have some personal issues with each other -- Matt becomes obsessed with the identity of Rich's famous mother, Rich reads Matt's diary to the club, their brothers visit, and Rich begins a bizarre romance that Matt is determined to sabotage.

And to keep us amused in the meantime, the series is scattered with little sketches and odd running gags -- Rich's dates going horribly awry (he starts blurting out weird things), music videos about babies, Matt's ongoing efforts to pick up stuff from a clothing boutique, guitar lessons, scatological fashion sense, a ""Thriller"" parody, visits by random rock stars (David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix among others), counseling, a man who compulsively blurts the F-word, office woes, and various other issues.

Fulcher and Berry apparently met while working on ""The Mighty Boosh,"" and you can detect some echoes of that series' surreality and warped buddy mentality. ""Snuff Box"" presents the world in an almost dreamlike way, where oddities and illogical things go without question -- even the way it's filmed is surreal, with the fish-eyed close-ups and strange random musical numbers. The glowing white hall and time travel don't hurt.

In fact, it takes awhile to figure out who these characters concretely are and what they are doing. The side-skits don't help -- most of them see Berry and Fulcher playing a host of side characters, ranging from rapping daddies to abusive hot-dog venders, contradictory therapists to harried office workers. Its biggest problem? Some of the sketches get kind of juvenile, like a skit about urine stains being part of high fashion that went on approximately FOREVER.

But eventually the stories veer back to the main tale of the lazy hangmen, who joke around with the priest as they kill people (they even toss around a severed head in one episode) and slouch around in their club. And once you get into the rhythm of the series, it becomes easier to understand what is going on and who Berry and Fulcher are playing at any given time.

I confess to having a peculiar crush on Matt Berry, with his resonant voice and peculiar sense of humor (""Nearly at the station!""), and he's excellent as a genteel, grasping, intensely troubled man (""I killed my first dog today. Am I going to be a serial killer?"") who is only nice to women he can have sex with. Fulcher is a bit harder to warm up to -- his acting style is a bit more affected with slower speech. But his naive-man-child-with-no-mouth-filter persona is pretty fun.

""Snuff Box"" can't be in love if it's plastic, but the weird, surreal blend of skit comedy and surreal ""Boosh"" Britcom ends up being a pretty fascinating piece of work. If nothing else, watch it for Berry and Fulcher's antics.",1409097600,2,3776,4.933858267716535

3515451,5,B00153NOR2,"I cannot even begin to describe all the types of comedy on display here.  It has elements of Monty Python and SNL, but other absurdist and surreal twists that go where those writers feared to tread.  Imagine a stuffy gentleman's club with a door that turns it into the 1800's. There's also a clothing shop with a different insane clerk every day.  It skewers class, gender, social manners, and immaturity in shocking ways.  It's a little closer to ""Chappelle Show"" and ""Whitest Kids You Know"" in terms of controversial subject matter.",1391040000,,534,4.835164835164835

I'd love to see this show revisited with another season, but focusing on the sitcom aspect with the Rich and Matt characters more, with fewer random sketches. As far as I'm concerned, they could have set the entire thing in the hangmen's club and added more dialogue and I would be thoroughly entertained (did love the Silver Cowboy Boots and Boyfriend sketches though)",1366848000,,545,4.797872340425532
3515454,2,B00153NOR2,"I read the reviews and this seemed like a gem, but after watching numerous episodes it turned out to be fake gold. Bummed.",1358380800,,122,4.3478260869565215
3515455,5,B00153NOR2,"There are very few genuine no-brainers in life. Purchasing this item is one of them for people who like Snuff Box. If you are here reading this (unless you are mistakenly attempting to purchase an actual box to put snuff in) then you should just buy this item now. Actually, even if you ARE here looking to purchase an actual box to put snuff in, you should get this DVD anyway and perhaps it will change your life. Perhaps not, but it's $18 after all.

Yes. You've perhaps already worn a shiny groove in the Netflix server hard disk watching Snuff Box. Random access is the best solution for this as I find myself needing to watch odd episodes at random times. There is something strangely pleasant, reassuring and calming about Rich's slightly fey Tourette-inspired rants and Matt's exquisite smarminess. We return to the club again and again to share a quiet whiskey and smoke with them - and then Rich's redneck brother shows up, Matt archly dismisses another street corner conquest or his deaf brother buzzily corrects a misconception.

The DVD ""set"" (well.. it's 1) is a veritable treasure trove. There are audio commentaries from Rich and Matt on three episodes including 1 and 6. They are fun and funny. Lagers are opened and they don't take it quite seriously enough for me but there it is. There is an excellent walking tour of the shooting locations. I particularly enjoyed this as the last time I was in London (Fall '12) the wife and I went on the Street Art London walking tour which basically ends up in the exact same spot - a series of small streets and blind alleys around the old Truman Brewery complex just off Brick Lane. (I can't recommend that tour highly enough.) Matt and Rich point out a variety of iconic locations including the Art Gallery and adjacent posh silver cowboy boots shop. Rich walks into the gallery and accosts some young women - you'll have to watch it. Apparently the long white corridor is in a building over their shoulder but, as Matt correctly points out, wasting time going up there would be crap. We also see the infamous Rapper with a Baby street and the site of several ""...my boyfriend...Crash!"" sketches and random chase scenes.

There is a ""Making of"" short that is quite fun - basically just a bunch of random on-set and behind the camera stuff. This includes staging of some of the dance numbers and multiple takes of Rich's office factotums (Elvis, Manson, Beckham kicking umpteen soccer balls at the camera). The outtakes are also fun including Richard Ayoade repeatedly cracking up. I didn't have much use for the ""Celebrity"" testimonials which just seem to be rejects culled from a longer/better item (""Taking Control of your Body"") which features extended commentary and analysis from Rich, Matt, former co-workers and fans from the UK/US (Noel Fielding, Simon Pegg, Paul Rudd, etc).

And then you have the CD, which gets the job done and then some. It seemingly includes every piece of music featured in the show. You know what that means and what a wonderful thing it is too. Without any question this is more than worth the cost of the whole shebang. I have to warn you, Matt Berry's music is pure dark magic earworm. You have probably already noticed the bizarre voodoo of the seemingly one-off theme song which pops into your head at the strangest of times and will not go away. (oh yeah, Matt actually has a funny short extra where he sits at the piano explains it). There is even a rocking live performance of the Hangman song.

Buy this item. Enjoy. Whiskey!",1357603200,8,3527,4.691437802907916
3515456,5,B00153NOR2,"This show/DVD is not for everyone, but it is an amazing achievement that was only ever aired once on BBC3. The fact that it has been released on DVD in the USA before ""Garth Marenghi's Darkplace"" or ""Man to Man with Dean Lerner"" is a testament to its strong comedy cult following. While watching it you may find that several select cuts were stolen and posted on YouTube as very popular comedy shorts. Although I am familiar with the work of Matt Berry and Rich Fulcher, these shorts were my only exposure to the series before I bought the DVD. I was not disappointed.

What it is is a hybrid sketch/sitcom show. At its root is the daily life of an angry mean spirited English hangman (Matt Berry) and his foul mouthed American Idiot assistant (Rich Fulcher). They are `friends', of sorts, that don't so much as have adventures as they do flow through situations. They may walk past a scene with other characters and then the other scene will take focus for a while until everything flows back, or on to something else. This is done brilliantly in a stream of consciousness/Harold sort of way (see UCB). I've never quite seen it done so well. Many of the characters are portrayed by Matt and Rich. I like the way the whole show flows through sketches and then comes back at the end.

This is definitely one of the most twisted sketch shows I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of sketch shows! It is very mean spirited and dark. Slapstick violence is portrayed not goofy, but with graphic realism. There are unexplained things that may confuse some watchers, but you need to shut off the need for explanations and just go with the flow. Why/How does the door next to the bathroom in the Gentleman's Club send the opener back to 1888? Who cares! Its part or the story, just watch and enjoy.

The one thing I did not like about the show was the music chosen that runs through the entire series. It is a catchy tune written and performed expertly by Matt Berry. For me it just doesn't fit. The song is a very popish ballad about true love turning out to be not so true that is almost but not quite upbeat. It is very catchy and has a brain worm effect on the listener, but I think it clashes with the darkness of the rest of the show.

The extras are not extensive, but it was only a six episode series. They do give a glimpse of the behind the scenes; a kind of comedy autopsy of this brilliant once in a lifetime series. I have to give it 5 stars for even being produced!",1345680000,,2473,4.334773218142549

I personally love the musical touch that Berry brings to the show and it provides an entertaining and often hilarious bit of originality.

The episodes became funnier and funnier as I was drawn into their delicious world of drunken sex, self-loathing, narcissism, absurdity, and violence. Phrases like ""sketch comedy"" don't adequately cover what this is. It might meet that definition technically but it's something much greater than that. It is a clever and tightly woven dark comedy universe with a first-rate soundtrack.

I've now watched the whole series from beginning to end many times. I love it.",1318896000,9,802,5.022556390977444

8288535,5,B00153NOR2,This show is perfect if you're into British absurdist humor  la The Mighty Boosh. Its a shame there were only 6 episodes. Delightfully inappropriate and reference-worthy.,1514851200,,170,5.538461538461538

8288537,5,B00153NOR2,"As much as I love the Mighty Boosh, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, the It Crowd, and Look Around You, Snuff Box will forever be my favorite British comedy of its era. It is derivative of nothing else and nothing else since then has quite captured its madcap brilliance. This set includes the entire series plus extras, as well as the fantastic Berry soundtrack. An absolute must-own for fans of great British comedy.",1510444800,,413,4.830985915492958
8288538,5,B00153NOR2,"Also, if you know the series at all (even from clips) or the main players, you'll love Snuff Box.  Matt Berry is god-like and Rich Fulcher is insane.  Seriously, if you like Toast of London, The Mighty Boosh, Darkplace, House of Fools, The IT Crowd, Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy then this is a must buy.  But you probably already know this.  FOLLOW YOUR HEART.",1506556800,,361,4.59375
8288539,5,B00153NOR2,"Berry & Fulcher bring their off-the-wall comedic charm and musical talent together in this series and it simply works. From their roles as dapper hangmen to the myriad of character shorts introduced time and again throughout the series, it's a UK meets US duo that never gets old.",1505865600,,280,4.854166666666667

8288542,5,B00153NOR2,"Snuff Box, IT Crowd, Garth Marenghi, Spaced, and The Mighty Boosh are my top five modern British comedies.

And out of the five, Snuff Box has become my absolute favorite. From the way it's shot, to the characters, the music, and the surreal moments, it's absolutely brilliant.

Matt berry and Rich Fulcher have perfect chemistry, and after watching this, if it clicks, you'll be quoting it for the rest of your life. As well as singing one the catchiest theme songs in history.",1494633600,,478,4.746987951807229

Luckily, I found this product and gifted it to my brother for Christmas. He was thrilled to be able to watch it again. Snuff Box is very off-kilter, and I suggest it to anyone who likes that.",1494201600,,297,3.966666666666667
