7883078,3,6305119945,"Gargantua was a 1998 TV movie that aired the very night that the American Godzilla film of that year first hit advance theaters.  If nothing else, the film certainly had good timing  capitalizing on the hoopla and buildup of Godzilla before anyone had a chance to see the blockbuster film and be disappointed.  Gargantua himself is, at best, a cousin to Godzilla  hes basically a salamander that got totally juiced on huge amounts of pesticides some company dumped into the ocean.  Gargantua does walk on two legs, but he doesnt breathe fire, rampage all over man and his creations just for the heck of it, or go looking for a fight.  The whole Gargantua family was just minding its own business, totally out of sight of man, until some seismic activity opened up a trench between its home and the nearby island of Malau.

Marine biologist Jack Ellway (Adam Baldwin) and his son have come to Malau to study the effects of recent earthquakes on local marine life.  The last thing Ellway expected to find was a nine-foot lizard emerging from the sea and scaring everyone on the island.  While he and another scientist attempt to study this magnificent creature, Ellways son Brandon (Emile Hirsch) finds and befriends an incredibly cute baby Gargantua.  Brandon keeps the little guy a secret, fearing that the adults (especially a local jerk hoping to get rich and  of course  the military) would hurt and probably kill him.  Of course, its hard to keep a baby dinosaur a secret when increasingly humongous relatives come looking for him.

This is not a monster terrorizing the island movie.  Im not saying a few innocent humans don't get killed, but no Gargantua really ever attacks anyone.  The same cannot be said for the humans, though, leading to one particularly sad moment in the film.  I could go on a rant about who the real monster is, but I won't (the answer is man, by the way).  The movie would probably get higher ratings if it had the monster stomping and smashing his way through everything in its way, but Gargantua isn't just some hulking menace hell-bent on destruction.  Personally, I thought the movie was pretty good, especially for a TV movie, and I especially liked how it painted the monster as both a victim and a magnificent animal deserving a chance to survive on this earth.",1408665600,,2300,4.733668341708543
7883079,2,6305119945,"This is too goofy a film to really scare anyone. Was it meant to?

A typical scientist/single dad is exploring marine life in the South Pacific. He has his young son along. A Mid-Sized Sea Monster emerges after an earthquake and starts eating islanders. BITE! SLASH! RIP!

Meanwhile, the boy discovers a Baby Monster sitting by his lonesome in a lagoon. Baby Monster is sooooo CUTE! He loves cheese puffs! He eats the cheese puffs from Boy's hand, making the most ADORABLE gurgling/crunching noises as he eats!

One's heart melts!

Then a GIANT Monster emerges from the ocean. Seems the Mid-Sized Monster was only big brother to the baby monster. Marines come in. Bazookas blast! Helicopters buzz by and shoot! Battle rages on! Giant Monster STEPS ON and SQUASHES the noble Marines! AAAHHHH!

So they KILL the Giant Monster!

Boy and Baby Monster run to the Giant Monster's corpse. Baby Monster sees his dead mommy! Baby Monster CRIES! All the humans -- Marines included -- get a lump in their throat. Poor Baby Monster lost his mom!

Script Writer now injects some HEAVY SYMBOLISM: Boy explains to his scientist dad how heart-broken Baby Monster is -- ""There's nothing worse than seeing your mother die!""

GET IT? script writer seems to be asking the audience. Boy and Baby Monster are alike, in that they both lost their mothers.

But wait! There's more!

Turns out Mommy Monster was married. Soon a SUPER-GIANT MONSTER -- Baby Monster's Dad -- emerges from the ocean, to commence an even greater killing spree! The humans murdered his Wife -- now it's personal!

Scientist dad has a plan to use Baby Monster to lure Daddy Monster back into the ocean, away from civilization, where they can live free and happy.

But wait! There's still more!

There's a subplot involving a Greedy Hunter from New Zealand. (The accent is similar to that of Aussies, so the Greedy Hunter resembles an evil&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crocodile-Dundee/dp/B000XVRD0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crocodile Dundee</a>). Greedy Hunter has his own plan -- to kidnap Baby Monster and exhibit him for money!

I won't spoil how it all ends. Just know that this is a really silly film. The sort that can't decide whether to make the monster scary or cute, so it does both. It sort of reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extra-Terrestrial-Visitors/dp/B00078809S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extra Terrestrial Visitors</a>, which had a blood-thirsty, murderous alien, whose cute alien child was befriended by an annoying little boy.

Gargantua is stupid and often boring. Possibly entertaining to those who love ""so bad it's good"" type cinema.",1379635200,,2712,5.393364928909953
7883080,5,6305119945,"This movie was really fantastic, the plot, the character development, and above all: the special effects. ""Gargantua"" has really set the bar for all science fiction movies to come. We really need more films like this in the future; high action and exciting flicks which draw in the younger crowds, and yet still manage to teach us to love each other in spite of our differences. The touching scene with the boy, the dinosaur, and the cheesballs was really beautifully written and wonderfully acted. I could go on and on about how wonderful this movie is but I should alo mention it's flaws: ...none! Ha ha ha.  We give it five thumbs up.",1049500800,5,637,4.6371681415929205
7883081,1,6305119945,"A family of mutated salamanders wreaks havoc on a tiny island paradise.  Of course, we're not talking mutation in the real-world sense, which would have meant a sickly little thing with perhaps an extra set of legs, but in the bad-movie sense of the word, which means bigger, stronger, and more ferocious.  (Hmmm, perhaps we should be feeding radioactive pesticides to our soldiers to increase their fighting ability...)
As some of the other reviewers on this page have pointed out, you might get a kick out of this if you're in the mood to laugh at a bad movie.  I found it too dull to be even inadvertantly funny.  I like star Adam Baldwin, but I was sorry to see him involved with this mess.  The rest of the cast is terrible, the creature design is the pits (think Barney with sharp teeth), the plot twists are ludicrous, and I'm running out of synonyms for 'bad' so I think I'll stop right here.",1045872000,,900,4.4969325153374236
7883082,1,6305119945,"I was in the mood for a bad rubber monster movie, so I picked up a copy of Gargantua.  It exceeded my expectations beautifully.  This made-for-tv Australian flick has all the elements of a so-bad-it's-good flick but one:  there are no gory deaths.  This makes Gargantua a great monster movie for the squeamish or for kids.  I'm sure kids would love it.
The film starts out with two bikini bimbos at a hula party.  They decided to go for a walk on the beach, and something pulls them into the water, drowning them.  Later on, a cute kayaking couple go for a night-time romp.  You know it's going to end tragically, and the hunky guy is pulled under and drowned.
For some reason, this means the entire fishing industry of the island must be halted.  In the meantime, the son of scientist finds a kyoot widdle baby salamander.  It's the size of a beagle and has big dewy eyes and slimy skin.  Because it's a mutant, it can only eat junk food.
A couple more injuries ensue when a 9' ""salamander"" with a rhino horn goes on a rampage.  The army is called in, of course.  Then, an even larger critter comes looking for his kids, and explosions result.
The most spectacular death occurs later on as a fisherman is slurped up like a wet noodle.  It's fun, fun, fun, for the whole family, with its laughable special effects, preposterous plot, and bad acting.  What more could you want for a beer & pretzels flick?  A Golden Turkey award-winner, if there ever was one....",995500800,8,1461,4.4772727272727275
7883083,1,6305119945,"A horrible movie! The special-effect are laughable, the acting pitiful, and the characters are annoying. When I first saw the previews it Gargantua looked awesome but then I saw it and was extremely disappointing. In video  stores they classify this movie in the horror section. . . it should be in  the comedy section, you'll laugh so much at this dumb movie. Don't watch.",943488000,2,373,4.8125
