326543,4,6301392469,"Some will say it's only a remake of DrJekyll and Mister Hyde. But there is a twist added to this classic. Mr Hyde is named Jack and his killings are attributed to Jack the Ripper, a completely different story. The beginning is also a second twist because it gives some traumatic experience Dr Jekyll, named Henry, had when he was a child and when he witnessed some sexual act he did not understand and was punished for it with a good spanking in a big volley of derisive laughter. Apart from that Mr Hyde is not in anyway distorted or looking like a monster. In fact it is Doctor Jekyll who uses a stick to walk because he limps. The best part of it is the very convincing acting of Anthony Perkins. One more exploration of insanity, here as the result of the past and the use of a drug.

326544,2,6301392469,"Anthony Perkins plays Dr Jekyl in a film very thinly based on the famous story.  Experimenting with drugs which bring out animals' more unpleasant characteristics he accidentally inhales the vapour of said drugs knocked over by a monkey in his lab (a scene 'borrowed' from Monkey Shines?)  He  then turns into what seems to be some distant relative of Barbara Cartland  and, before you can say Hyde, he is roaming the streets as Jack the  Ripper.
Though Perkins is in fine form, it has to be said that this film  seems to be no more than an excuse for one example of sexual  depravity after another.  The constant sexual scenes before long  demonstrate a complete lack of ideas on the part of the script-writers and  the 'surprise' ending is just laughable.  There is the occasional  briefer-than-brief appearance of one or two characters from the Jekyl and  Hyde novel, but they certainly can't save this film from being anything but  a bore.",949276800,2,943,4.77639751552795
326549,2,6301392469,"The following is a review about ""Edge of Sanity"" starring Anthony Perkins.

""Edge of Sanity"" stars Anthony Perkins as Dr. Henry Jekyll, a physician whose experiments using cocaine go terribly wrong. Though based on a famous Robert Louis Stevenson story, the 1989 UK-France-Hungary-US production is actually a not-so-successful rehash of the topic we are all familiar with: Jack the Ripper. Here, the doctor turns into Jack Hyde, not Edward.

Yes, in ""Edge of Sanity"" Dr. Jekyll is a married man, probably in his fifties. Dr. Jekyll lives with Mrs. Jekyll (Glynis Barber), who doesn't know the eminent doctor's nightly activities including serial killings and kinky sexual behaviors. Sometimes the film looks like a curious blend of soft porno and a gore fest, with the overacting star wearing a zombie-like make-up.

The concept of ""Jack / Hyde"" could have been more intriguing with a slick narrative and convincing set-ups which ""Edge of Sanity"" just doesn't have. With minimum attention paid to character development or historical details, director Grard Kikone only repeats the same pattern until the underwhelming climax. Except for the repetitious violence and sex the film doesn't make any sense at all. Avoid it.",1298764800,2,1219,5.27319587628866
326550,5,6301392469,"Anthony Perkins stars in this mix of a Jeckyll and Hyde / Jack the Ripper story.  The dvd is pretty barebones, featuring a... *drumroll* theatrical trailer.  It's a flip-side disc featuring full screen on one side, wide screen on the other and the film itself is presented with stereo sound.  The main reason to look into this is the price.  It generally remains at a low low price of simply a few bucks, and the movie itself isn't that bad, made particularly watchable by the great Anthony Perkins.",1283126400,,499,4.636363636363637
326551,3,6301392469,"Dr. Jekyll (Anthony Perkins from THE TRIAL, PSYCHO 1-4, PRETTY POISON) is working on a new anesthetic in his lab, when his test monkey accidentally mixes the wrong chemicals together. Uh-oh! The fumes from the mixture cause Jekyll to transform into the hideous Mr. ""Jack"" Hyde! This culminates in much debauchery through nightly visits to the bad side of town. Of course, Hyde is a sadistic, twisted serial killer (yep, THAT Jack) w/ a vendetta against prostitutes, so we are quickly taken into the gutters and back alleys, as well as a rather groovy brothel. Perkins gets to ham it up royally, see-sawing wildly between quiet, reserved doctor and gonzo-murderer! Anyone else might seem ridiculous, but Perkins is in familiar territory here! Loaded w/ nudity, blood, and semi-psychedelic lighting, EDGE OF SANITY is a wacked-out hoot!...",1274918400,,837,5.161764705882353
326552,4,6301392469,"I've always been fascinated by the mystique of Jack the Ripper, and I'm a big fan of ""Psycho"" - the granddaddy of all slasher films.  Naturally, I was thrilled to discover ""Edge of Sanity,"" which stars Anthony Perkins as Dr. Henry Jekyll.  At night, he transforms into the sexually perverse Mr. Jack Hyde who fondles and kills prostitutes in Whitechapel.  The newspapers christen him The Ripper.

  In 1972, Hammer Productions released a similar film:  ""Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde.""  Sister Hyde was killing prostitutes in order to obtain their female hormones to be used in an elixir prolonging life.  She also became known as the Ripper.

  Go back farther and we learn that Hammer released ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll"" in 1960.  This Dr. Jekyll doesn't transform into Jack the Ripper; however, he does become a virile, handsome, and amoral Dr. Hyde - very similar to the one in ""Edge of Sanity.""

  Anthony Perkins' Dr. Jekyll wanted to have the freedom to live life to the fullest without responsibility.  He didn't want to be held accountable for his actions, no matter how ghastly they were.  All of us have a little of Mr. Hyde in us.  Therefore, we all live on the edge of sanity.  Because, without laws and rules, we would all become insane.

  As he did in ""Psycho,"" Anthony Perkins gives a superb performance during this bizarre character study of an emotionally torn man.  Glynis Barber is wonderful as the dutiful wife, Elizabeth, whose tortured search for her husband's nefarious friend, Jack Hyde, leads to a gruesome ending that will chill you.

  ""Edge of Sanity"" is highly recommended for fans of stylish, gothic horror.  Fans of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and/or Jack the Ripper legends will also want to add this DVD to their collection (along with Hammer`s ""Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde"" and ""The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll."")  Be forewarned, MGM's release has a widescreen and standard version with a theatrical trailer, but no special features on how it was made.  The audio and video, however, are great.",1232150400,,2024,4.782608695652174
326553,4,6301392469,"I came across this unusual film while walking in a video store that specializes in the kinds of movies not often found at your local Blockbuster.

This film is a rather loose and artistic take on the story of Jekyll & Hyde but also combines the story of Robert Louis Stevenson with the legend of Jack the Ripper.  Its an unusal almalgamation, but a fascinating and compelling idea.

I watched this film and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a darkly artistic film which clashes the morality of the late Victorian era with the prevalent excesses of the 1980's.

In addition, the story is altered to which Jekyll doesn't overtly wish to explore the darker sided of mankind which is why he does the experiment in the first place.  His initial experiments involve a new drug which can be used as an analgesic or anasthetic, the white powder which isn't even named in the film but what we all know to be cocaine.  It is only through an accident in the lab that Jekyll discovers 'freebasing', and his subsequent addiction to the drug is what triggers the trasnformations and unleashes his alter ego.

Anthony Perkins is without a doubt in his element in this film, able to play a mild-mannered physician with a slight limp, and act with utter relish as his dark side is unleashed as Hyde.

what is interesting and what may put off some people is that the prostitutes in the film look as though they are dressed up like Madonna.  I'll admit the film isn't perfect but those things don't take away from the film, they add to it.  It's why the film is so unique, because obviously not everyone is going to like it, its the sort of film that only appeals to those individuals that like a little something different  with their horror films.",1127088000,8,1725,4.564935064935065
326554,4,6301392469,"Forget what the critics say - the only horror movies they ever like are the old black & whites anyway - this is a heck of an entertaining movie that isn't your typical Hollywood dreck. I only wish the ending were better... nonetheless, it still gets the big thumbs up in my book!",1098230400,,279,4.283018867924528
326555,5,6301392469,"This 'R-Rated' 2002 DVD re-release is actually six minutes longer than the previous 'Unrated'/'International' edition. The extra running time is almost all accounted for by this version being transferred to video at the correct 24fps theatrical rate whereas the earlier incarnation was artificially speeded up to around 25fps even for NTSC users. This made watching the old and new versions side-by-side difficult as I kept on having to pause the earlier recording in order for this one to catch up. They are virtually identical except for a couple of scenes. At the end of the pigeon-man/voyeur sequence there is now a close up of the victim's throat being slashed before splattering the pigeon with blood. Much later on when Jack is confronted by the old tart outside his front door we now get to see the horror he inflicted on her in gory close-up whereas before we had only the vaguest of clues as to what he was doing to her.

The DVD contains both a widescreen and 4x3 transfer of the main feature on opposite sides of the disc. The differences in picture composition are negligible so it is down to what kind of TV you own as to which you will prefer. Each side also contains its own version of the theatrical trailer and scene selections.

For what it's worth this is one of my favourite movies and I'm not even a horror fan. This is easily one of Anthony Hopkins' best three performances, the others being Psycho and Crimes of Passion made around the same time as this and in which he played virtually the same part. I first read about it when it became a late night cult hit on cable TV which I don't have so I rented the video then bought the laserdisc version and now the DVD. Some people seem to have missed the point that this is a modern gothic horror and not meant to be read as a historical document. Hence the blend of new wave punk fashions and victorian morality. It may be a triumph of style over content but it is a magnificent triumph.",1091491200,,1958,4.512676056338028
326556,4,6301392469,"Of course, any role played by the late, great Anthony Perkins is going to be done to the utmost perfection.  There is also an absolutely superb supporting cast in this film as well.  Unfortunately, the screenplay itself is not worthy of such talent.  The only thing good about this film is the actors themselves.  Too bad they couldn't have been casted for a better film.  Watch this movie only for its artistic value and for the superb performances.  Don't, however, expect a great film....you'll be disappointed.",1039305600,2,514,4.9186046511627906
326557,4,6301392469,"If you're a fan of the dark and twisted (with an artsy edge), then Edge Of Sanity will enthrall you.  Others should know by the film's packaging summary that this is going to be a perverse ride and BEWARE.  Dogging this film is not fair considering other realms into sexual depravity such as From Hell and Eyes Wide Shut are just grandiose eye candy.
While experimenting with anesthetics, Dr. Jekyll accidentally inhales fumes from an altered drug.  This unleashes not only ability to act out his inhibitions, it unleashes repressed sexual feelings he had experienced as humiliation during his childhood.  He then goes on a killing spree as Jack The Ripper, and becomes obsessed with a prostitute named Susannah that closely resembles the woman from his past.
Yes, Edge Of Sanity is sinister, twisted, perverse, and trashy.  It's also lavish, elegant, and beautifully done. The cinematography is excellent (MGM's DVD is a vast improvement over the old VHS from the late 1980s), the costumes are a wow, and the music score is superb as well as appropriate to the scenes it enhances.  A lot of imagination went into this production, and it's unfair to say it's an inappropriate film considering the many other ""critically acclaimed"" attempts at the dark side of sexuality and drug addiction.
Anthony Perkins chews the scenery well, playing his part of Jack Hyde to the hilt.  It would be hard to think of any other actor that could have carried this part so well.  Those who adored him in Psycho, Pretty Poison, and Crimes Of Passion will find a lot to love about his role in Edge Of Sanity.
I first viewed this film in the late 1980s on an unrated VHS edition, and MGM's DVD is most likely the closest to that version there is.  I found no difference that I could notice between that original unrated version and this one, taking into consideration that MGM has been reissuing many obscure films like this one in their uncut forms (such as The Burning) though they have a rating listed.  For film collectors of the dark and sinister, this is a nice addition and you'll be pleased with the great transfer.  The only extras are a trailer and subtitles, but that's fine considering the low price for this DVD.  I'm just thrilled that MGM has rescued Edge Of Sanity from obscurity for a whole new audience to discover and relish as well as make established fans like myself very, very happy.
Call it trash if you want to, but it's quality, wicked, ELEGANT trash and a fascinating tale to savor.",1033257600,21,2489,4.709677419354839
