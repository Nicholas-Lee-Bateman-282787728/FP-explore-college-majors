8378031,5,B002QW6YIM,"This Polish movie re-creates Poland in the 1950's wonderfully in so many ways. Filmed as a ""documentary"" of making the movie, with the actors in character both in the movie and in the ""documentary, the drama comes so alive. I loved the soliloquies of the main female character as she recounts her life during World War II and all the suffering Polish people endured. Just great drama and a wonderful story.",1477094400,,406,4.732394366197183
8378032,4,B002QW6YIM,"""Tatarak"" is one of the latest efforts of a Polish movie master A. Wajda. The film is a slow, deeply psychological /phylosiphical meditation upon memory, love, the loss of beloved ones, the choices one takes in his life. It reminded me of ""Young Girls Of Wilko"" - another of Wajda's fine films from the 70-ies. Highly recommended to those who expect serious, deep experience from a film.",1374710400,,387,4.791044776119403
