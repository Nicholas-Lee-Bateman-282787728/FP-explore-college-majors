6397617,5,B00K0HDCPI,just received it in the mail yesterday so i haven't had the chance to watch it yet. im sure it won't disappoint. thanks again,1412121600,,125,4.25
6397618,5,B00K0HDCPI,perfect birthday gift for my friend who loves yes,1411948800,,49,4.555555555555555
6397619,5,B00K0HDCPI,"Very nice addition to any Yes fan collection (notice that I said addition, as it seems to be somewhat different from the original 2DVD version of the same title), be aware that, if I'm not mistaken, from what I recall, it is not the same material that was released before in old 2DVD from 2005 edition, the performance doesn't seem to be from the same venue or night, this edition has a bonus concert from a rainy day concert, very good also....but what bothers me is why naming it the same, if you are going to modify the material on it, the stage looks somewhat different to me...so be aware that it will be an addition, do not make the same mistake I did, selling the 2 DVDs...

Update: I stand corrected, it is the same show, just in a different order, as another person stated below...regardless a very good show, and  a must!!!!",1411948800,13,834,4.409090909090909

6397643,5,B00K0HDCPI,A fine set by a fine group of artists... I enjoyed watching this back to back with Yessongs...my how we are all getting on in years...:-),1476316800,,137,4.3076923076923075
6397644,5,B00K0HDCPI,The band sounded great! I'm not a big fan of unplugged which is how they perform some of the set list but they play them electric in the other show on the DVD. Terrific concert overall.,1473638400,2,185,4.166666666666667

6397646,5,B00K0HDCPI,"I just picked this bluray up from Hastings. After an hour into it I have to say, I love it! I'm 50 and have been a fan as long as I can remember but never got the chance to see them live. This is my kind of entertainment.",1463184000,,221,3.625

6397648,3,B00K0HDCPI,"The Dolby Digital recording is so-so, the video is very grainy, I was not impressed.  The other concert on the video which is not Dolby Digital has pretty good sound considering it plays in Neo6 mode.  I believe if they had processed that in DD it would have been really impressive.  My DVD with Symphonic Yes is much better in all aspects.",1462060800,4,340,4.451612903225806

6397666,4,B00K0HDCPI,Thought the 35th anniversary show lacked spontaneity. Trying to be too perfect is always bad for live recordings. I liked the Lugano show because it was a little more loose.  The acoustic set with the different version of Roundabout was enjoyable.,1445731200,,247,5.024390243902439

6397680,5,B00K0HDCPI,"the prog-bands have not had a very committed audience among the younger cohort, however, for us old farts who have seen these bands live, (i've seen yes live 5 times), they are missing some of the greatest musicianship and live performances in all of rock history. so sad to see chris squire-bass player for yes has died of cancer. to see him play live was extraordinary.",1441497600,5,371,4.636363636363637

6397685,5,B00K0HDCPI,"this dvd stands on it's own, but in the description of this dvd says that it was the last time it's original linup played together. rick bufford was the original lineup (drummer), and I've seen rick wakeman at least 3 times since this dvd was recorded, I can't say I liked him at all, he lost his timing.",1434931200,,304,4.258620689655173

6397690,4,B00K0HDCPI,"Even though their age shows on the outside, their performance was flawless. Good to see them back together for this show.",1425686400,,121,4.809523809523809
6397691,5,B00K0HDCPI,"This is an impressive group of songs from one of the all time great progressive rock groups,  This type of music is not easy to play by anyone and once again we see the diversity of talent from the band members.  It doesn't matter how old they are.  What is important is the quality of the lyrics and  instrumentation that is the spirit of Yes.  It is important what the songs have to say and how they move the audience when played Live. Each of the members have had successful solo careers but it doesn't compare to the group achievement.  You likely won't see many groups on the same level as this group.  It was good to see them get together again for this tour.",1425600000,,665,4.272
6397692,4,B00K0HDCPI,"If you only want one Yes live video then I would opt for either `Live At Montreux' or `Symphonic' as for me they have the edge but not by much. The video quality is good as is the audio with stereo and DTS HD options. You get an additional concert on the blu ray from Lugano in Switzerland as part of the same 2004 tour which is half the length of `Tsongas' but still a good watch although the video quality is not great.
What differentiates the `Tsongas' concert from other `Yes' videos is when they go `acoustic' in the middle section of the concert. I use the term acoustic very loosely as they are all still plugged in to amplifiers but Steve Howe and Chris Squire use acoustic guitars/bass with pickups,Alan White is up front with the rest of the band on a kit with just bass drum,snare and hi hat and Rick Wakeman plays a piano and not synths. I found it to be really appealing as the songs were subtly different but still had a kick to them.`Roundabout' was done in a Chicago blues style but still held its charm and rocked just as much.
So for the above reason this is definitely worth buying as these guys are still playing superbly and Jon Anderson still has that voice.",1423094400,7,1180,4.31981981981982

I almost didn't buy Songs From Tsongas 35th anniversary because of some negative reviews and I have the best of Yes live at Montreux  2003 and now after having seen Songs from Tsongas 35th Anniversary concert with Yes playing Awesome music to fans recorded in HD Master Audio for a better picture and sound ( also PCM Stereo ) was Worth it as for the second concert recorded in Lugano Switzerland 2004 even though says HD Master Audio my receiver keeps changing to all channel stereo with a good picture that doesn't take up the full 16/9 TV Screen , pretty close though Still a Great Yes Concert that not even the rain stopped them from performing ... more than good enough for me .",1421280000,13,1946,4.18230563002681

6397702,5,B00K0HDCPI,"The more I watched the more sad I became. This is where Yes ended on a great high note. I saw the show at MSG the night before and I had a great seat on the floor and I had a sullen feeling this was going to be the end of this band line up with Jon and Rick. I just felt it. And in 2014 here we are. Some people think they're slow here. Try now.... There horrible. When they tried again in 2008 and Jon almost dies. Yes should ended there and then. Since 08 they been a joke and tarnishing their legacy. There will never be the great YES again. RIP.

The one thing that was stupid on this new blu ray dvd was making Ritual a bonus track... on a blu ray. Like they had no room for it in the regular set list. Mistake. Looks better than the 2004 version that's for sure when it was 2 disc set. But even then Ritual was in the list with the rest. What idiot makes these decisions.",1417392000,2,877,3.8722222222222222
6397703,1,B00K0HDCPI,A tired concert from what sounds like a aging tribute band.,1416873600,,59,4.454545454545454

6397706,3,B00K0HDCPI,"I'm getting old. These guys are even older. And it shows. This is a great blu ray from a original band together sense. But that's about as good as it gets. Cool to hear them perform some of the classics but don't expect a rock and roll show. This is definitely the subdued laid back version. And the acoustic versions of some of the favorites made me cringe.

From a video standpoint it's pretty good quality. DTS MA is adequate but there are some low end thumps and notes that come out of nowhere that will tax your subs if you have a good system. Be forewarned. Howe's guitar is very low in the mix. Jon's voice isn't bad for his age though. And the rest of the guys do an OK job.

There's just not a lot of OOOmph to it. They are just sort of going through the motions.

If you're a raving fan buy it. Not something that's going to get much playback in my system.",1415923200,18,866,4.112426035502959

6397709,5,B00K0HDCPI,Fantastic!!! Another great YES Blu-ray concert. A little rain couldn't stop these guys from performing a great set list.,1415577600,,120,5.368421052631579

6397711,5,B00K0HDCPI,"Incredible - one of the best live shows from the ""classic"" line-up - The guitar - miniMoog solo trades at the end of South Side of the Sky alone makes this worth the purchase !!!",1415232000,6,178,4.114285714285714

6397715,4,B00K0HDCPI,"I saw the Yes in 1971 just after they released the Yes album. The band was tight, well practiced and loved performing. Thirty-five years have passed and the performance at Tsongas was very good but lacked the energy and excitement the band displayed in 1971. Yes is the leader of the progressive rock movement. No other band has or can imitate their style, musicianship or song writing. For Yes fans this is a must add to the collection. For those who never got a chance to see the band perform in their early years, it is simply a performance that demonstrates the bands technical skills and refinement as they have progressed throughout the years and member changes. The acoustic segment of the performance is a nice touch allowing the band to reinterpret some of their greatest hits in a unique and interesting way. The video is worth buying just for this play set alone.",1414281600,11,874,4.681818181818182
6397716,1,B00K0HDCPI,"Love the band and even the song selections, However Jon's voice was NOT in good shape for most of this tour, particularly near its last weeks so be warned this is not the best of YES but only the last of the great ""classic"" post Bruford line up.",1414108800,2,245,4.125
6397717,5,B00K0HDCPI,"I really enjoyed this bluray. Editing was good, audio is marvelous, but perhaps the video quality is a little shy of stunning. It looked like a smoky arena which wouldn't help. This is a fine compliment to their Montreux  bluray which I also have, lots of different songs on this one, & has an acoustic set to create a different flavour for some of their songs. This features the classic Yes line-up I love. On the down-side I found the bonus concerts  sound is really poor, one of those that you have to crank the sound way up, & it still sounds inferior. The main concert is almost 2.5 hrs. long so you still get your money's worth, but I don't think the bonus show will ever get a second watch.
Still, it's a keeper, & no regrets with this one.",1413590400,11,747,4.290780141843972
