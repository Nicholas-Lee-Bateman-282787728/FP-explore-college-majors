8675926,3,B00N35JA4G,I enjoy the sweat but the workouts are very repetitive; my preference is for more variety in such a short blast. I really enjoy other DVDs from this line.,1433289600,2,154,4.344827586206897

8675929,3,B00N35JA4G,"I like Brett Hoebel, not sure why he didn't last longer on Biggest loser. These workouts are pretty simple and basic so pass if you have any experience with working out. Basically each of the four workouts has four workouts in each, each one repeated four times. For more variety and a better workout try to get Brett's Rev Abs series. They are five star workouts.",1420675200,6,364,4.53030303030303
8675930,4,B00N35JA4G,"This DVD was recommended to me by Amazon; at first I wasn't interested, but when I saw that the price had dropped to $7.56 from $12.99, I decided to just give it a try.  My background: I am pretty fit and I exercise 6 times a week mostly using Jillian Michaels' DVDs.

For $7.56 this was a great deal because it comes with 4 different 25 minute workouts.  Between my full time job and parental obligations, half hour workouts are the most ideal for me.  These workouts are great because you really don't need any additional equipment (although weights are optional for some workouts).  These workouts were not as intense as Jillian Michaels, but I still got a great burn.

The reason why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because some of the moves were a bit awkward.  I personally didn't like the capoeira moves; I prefer to do traditional lunge variations as opposed to the capoeira ones.  Other than that, the instructor has excellent energy and the workouts are fun.  I would recommend previewing the videos before jumping into them. The 30 / 30 workout is my favorite.",1420329600,5,1079,4.578125
