2620185,5,B000GW8RWU,"Really good video. Most of the songs translate to acoustic really well. Compared to ""Pixies Sell-out"", this has quite a very different, more subtle dynamic. Francis's weird, edgy lyrics become much clearer. A good thing! Stand-outs: ""Mr. Grieves"", ""Wave of Mutilation"", ""Gauge Away"", ""Hey"" and ""Debaser""...from the BTS docu. Excellent behind-the-scenes bonus footage. You get an intimate view of the band working out the new arrangements.",1156464000,9,438,5.651515151515151

8134885,5,B000GW8RWU,"It took 6 months from placing the order to arrive, but it was worth the wait.  I love this, a lot.  But I love the Pixies, so I am biased.
This is great because you see a different side to them, and it shows how versatile they are, and actually how little they rely on electronics and effects to produce great music.  Listening to it, it's hard to believe Dave Lovering only has a kick, snare, fixed high-hat and tambourine.
If you are learning to play guitar and want to play Pixies songs, I can't think of better footage than this to see exactly how they play the pieces themselves, you get to see so much of their finger work, particularly Joey's and Charles', but also Kims's bass to an extent.",1515542400,,698,4.312977099236641

8134889,4,B000GW8RWU,"I am a Pixies fan from way back and really love their hard driving,loud quiet loud style. This offering is a nice refreshing take on their classic tunes. This all acoustic film from the Newport Jazz Festival lets you hear some vocal details than could never be heard in the standard versions. I found I really enjoyed this softer side of the Pixies. The quality, both sound and picture is excellent. Much better than the Pixies Sellout tour film as a matter of fact. If you are a Pixies fan buy this CD and enjoy a different look at the band.",1297555200,2,542,4.376237623762377
8134890,5,B000GW8RWU,"I agree with another reviewer that if you haven't heard the Pixies, this isn't a good place to start.  Its really gritty and Black's voice isn't as polished or practiced as in a studio CD.

Wow though, I get chills in River Euphraties when Black yells ""one sip FROM THE SALTY WINE"" so raw and so good.  I think the quality is pretty good considering they are doing -in acoustic- their old albums from 15 some years ago.

You have to love when Black yelps like a dog in Crackity Jones, I LOVE IT!

Also Kim Deal is solid throughout and still has a pretty voice.

If you like the Pixies, you can't go wrong with this disk.  Even though the songs are acoustic, the raw energy pours through in classic Pixies style.",1199923200,,711,4.3007518796992485
8134891,1,B000GW8RWU,"A sure way to kill any music performance is having an unskilled musician. I wish I could have seen the Pixies in about 1990, because on this DVD from their reunion-era, singer and guitarist Francis Black is so out of practice,  rhythm and tune that the entire set is crippled.

The setlist is great, all the great Pixies songs I can think of are on this DVD. Unfortunately, the longer the show goes on the more apparent it is that Black Francis has not played any of them in a long time (too busy focusing on his mediocre solo outings?). The worst example is when the band begins to play a song, and Francis is singing another. After a couple of bars he stops and apologizes and leads the band into restarting ""the song that's on the list.""

I am a huge Pixies fan, and it would take a lot to turn me off to an acoustic performance such as this one. Nirvana and Alice in Chains unplugged are two of my favorites, and the Alice in Chains show was also somewhat of a reunion. The difference is that it looks like all of the members of Alice in Chains practiced and were prepared for the show, and in the Pixies show, Francis Black consistently rushes the tempo, sings too loud and out of tune (moreso than usual), and generally takes out the legs of the otherwise amazing group.

Kim Deal's vocals are in such a contrast to Francis's that it really is funny. Apparently it's not a coincidence that Kim's solo project was more successful than Francis's. Her soft and melodic voice moves lightly from note to note and word to word, where his is comparable to the screams of someone with a fear of needles getting a tetanus shot. The lead guitar Joey Santiago and drummer David Lovering are also in great form, and the performance is amazing, especially Gigantic, when Francis is not on the mic.

This is not worth owning, I gave mine away to a friend who didn't heed my warning not to take it. It's barely worth watching once to see how the band reacts to this mockery of the commanding singer that they once had.",1197072000,9,2009,4.389784946236559
8134892,5,B000GW8RWU,all the songs are great because the pixies never made a bad song this dvd is great,1185408000,3,82,3.8823529411764706
8134893,3,B000GW8RWU,"Fine camerawork and editing are undercut by the lack of anamorphic mastering which in a widescreen video produced in 2006 is inexcusable. Also the unplugged format doesn't really serve Pixies music well. Because despite the obvious influences from the Talking Heads and the Police, the Pixies aren't really about music. They aren't really about playing guitars. Theirs is an impressionistic sound in which the effect is the point of the song. The lyrics mean whatever you happen to think they mean. Take away Santiago's distortion and half the sound and fury is gone.

Because of the quick cutting video in Pixies Sell Out it looks like the Club Date is the concert video to have.",1174608000,5,680,4.913043478260869
8134894,5,B000GW8RWU,"From the behind-the-scenes practice and dress rehersal on this DVD, it's apparent that the Pixies were not particularly comfortable performing an acoustic set. They had no reason to be nervous. It takes a lot more than a distortion pedal to make a Pixies song a Pixies song, and removing it just brings those signature elements to the surface. In particular, Joey's expressive guitar playing. Sounds I once assumed to be synthetic are now obviously the result of his gonzo style. But everyone contributes, and the clean acoustic arrangements make the sheer energy and catchiness of many Pixies songs stand out. How can you not sing along to ""Hey"" or ""Gigantic""?

Pixies fans will buy this DVD regardless, but I think it may make a great introduction for new listeners. If you're just curious about the Pixies, give it a listen.  Sing along a little. You'll like it.",1156723200,7,865,4.877551020408164
