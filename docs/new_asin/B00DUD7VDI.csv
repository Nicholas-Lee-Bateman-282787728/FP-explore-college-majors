5855674,5,B00DUD7VDI,"The team of Toni Servillo in the lead role as the sybaritic critic and novelist (having only ever written one successful novel 20 years before) playing out the role of Jep Gambardella, one of the oldest swingers in Rome and directed and co-written by Paolo Sorrentino, have again hit pay-dirt. I hope like the previous ""Il Divo"" it achieves another Oscar nomination!!

At 135 minutes it is a movie that will either envelop you with its stunning visuals (right up to the end of the closing credits in fact) and intelligent script or leave you thinking it is way too long and over indulgent. Many of Sorrentino's normal trademarks are here - the use of different dance and music to great dramatic effect; beautifully composed visuals, though his continual use of tracking and crane shots can get a tad tiresome; a wide cast of strong supporting actors that serves Servillo's immaculately attired but tired and acerbic persona well; and, the story of a man having lived the high life being woken up to face his demons - but what lifts this film to a higher level is its love affair with Rome.

The use of locations and few studio sets (with some amazing use of animals for key scenes) shows off the beauty of Rome and its architecture to great effect. Top that with a story centered around the Italian wealthy who live and party in Rome has led inevitably to comparisons with La Dolce Vita of Fellini and Antonioni films of that era. But with little reference to the recent politics of Berlusconi and modern Italy this is an exploration of the current vacuousness of living within Rome's elites both in the Arts and interestingly the Church, given the Vatican's presence within Rome.

The script is razor sharp throughout. The outright or latent bitchiness on display, leads to many great one-liners or acidic exchanges. This is beautifully captured in a scene where he openly tears into a friend at a roof top party after she challenges him to disagree with her. His Svengali female midget magazine editor, pragmatic housekeeper, friends including the widowed husband of his early love and a blossoming relationship with a 40 year old stripper (a fine performance by Sabrina Ferilli), all add to the growing emptiness. This leads to Jep's encounters in the final section with a cardinal in line to be pope who is happier espousing food recipes over religious advice and a Mother Theresa clone from Africa whose simple life of piety and suffering contrasts so dramatically with Jep's.

Many reviews of this film seem to still pine for the New Wave Italian cinema of the 60s - this latest opus from Sorrentino and Servillo shows for me Italian cinema is very much alive and well in the 21st century!",1390608000,31,2695,4.764453961456103

5855676,5,B00DUD7VDI,"I'm thrilled to see that Criterion Collection is releasing this film on disc so soon.  I've seen it twice in the theater and it's one of the very best films I've ever seen.  Not to be missed for anyone who appreciates Italian films, especially those by Fellini & Antonioni.  Yes it contains many moments that reference La Dolce Vita, but as great as that film is, this one owes it no debt, it transcends La Dolce in many ways.  On my first viewing I was swept away from start to finish.  On second viewing the fragility of life and the poignancy of loss came to the fore.  Amazing images and a great musical score.

The main character, Jep Gambardella, looked all his life for the great beauty but didn't find it.  We get to see it everywhere around him.",1389916800,84,754,4.374100719424461
5855677,5,B00DUD7VDI,This movie is so intense. Sorrentino shows a Roma so beautiful and so damned in the same time. It deserves the oscar,1389571200,5,116,4.318181818181818
5855678,4,B00DUD7VDI,"""The Great Beauty"" (Italian: La Grande Bellezza), directed by Paolo Sorrentino, is a lovely film, simultaneously self aware and unashamed in channeling several of the themes, stylistic flourishes and concerns previously identified with classic Italian films like ""La Dolce Vita"", ""8 1/2"", ""L'Avventura"" and so forth. It makes superb use of Rome in all its classical beauty as a location for mournful contemplations on lost youth, present life, pending mortality and the tribal malaise and pretenses of Rome's creative elite, all presented with lots of style and sizzle. How much a viewer finds the film to ultimately be either haunting and depressing or stimulating and entertaining may depend on how close to home the life concerns and reflections of the protagonist are to the viewer's own life.

The ""La Dolce Vita"" like story of dissipated Roman creative posers and party animals confronting middle age, lost promise, failure and mortality, as though Marcello Mastroianni had never managed to transcend the final scenes of ""La Dolce Vita"", and had just grown old where we last saw him, allows for some wicked insights into and comments on Roman artistic life and an Italian film genre that is best summarized as ""We are surrounded by so much beauty and greatness from the past, but we can only create empty beauty because we lack greatness, and can never achieve it again, and are tormented by the language and symbols of Catholicism, and are twisted into knots and self negation by intellectualizing about modernity. What else can we do but party? And, of course, we are melancholy at the emptiness of it all..."".

If the ""The Great Beauty"" has an over all insight, which is suggested by the introductory quote from Cline's ""Journey to the End of the Night"", it is that the characters have all, in ways big and small, succumbed to the delusion that they each can, through art and the intellectualized control of discourse and expression, control and master the illusion of life. Each character has been either broken, humbled or sobered by the effort, and has found that a great deal of what they could have enjoyed about the illusion has been lost to them in an effort to dominate it.

The protagonist, Jep Gambardella, a once promising author with only one book of intellectualized social commentary to his credit, published very early in his career, after which he has settled into a long languorous slide to middle age as a ""journalist"" reporter on the arts in Rome, is sympathetic in that he has begun to grasp this underlying truth, and is working to reconcile himself to it. Many other characters in the film seem to have settled into the sort of dour connoisseurship and bored hostility usually associated with vendors in a Parisian flea market.

The film abounds in vignettes and passing comments, many quite touching and some of them quite depressing, involving different characters who come and go from scene to scene, all pointing to the fury of now being held prisoner by the long shadow of the past. There is, for example, the elderly fallen aristocratic couple, living in the basement of their family's old palazzo, which is open to tourists to earn income, who rent themselves out as aristocratic dinner guests. On returning late at night from a party, where Jep had hired them to impersonate old rivals of their family, who were unavailable but whom Jep had wished to attend a dinner party at his apartment being held for a Mother Teresa like saint that Jep wishes to interview, the wife of the elderly couple slips into the old palazzo and inserts some coins into an audio guide and, sobbing, listens to an audio explanation of the palazzo and an idealized account of her life there as a child. And no Italian film aspiring to social comment would be complete without scenes that highlight the vanity and fallibility of the Catholic establishment.

Perhaps the most telling, and memorable, at least for this viewer, line in ""The Great Beauty"" is spoken by Jep's hapless friend Romano, a seemingly talentless creative striver continuously rejected by Roman elites and audiences and continuously working to launch a fresh assault on the mountaintop with a new project. Romano, who angrily criticizes the basis of his artistic rejection, while masochistically humiliating himself in pursuit of a beautiful woman who can barely stand speaking to him, finally wins some approval by giving a performance piece where he grovels to the audience that he is ""ordinary"". Momentarily heartened by the applause he receives, even though the woman he craves walks out of the show as soon as he has finished, he soon decides to quit Rome altogether.

He tells Jep of his brief success with the audience. Jep replies, with some genuine empathy for his friend, that it's wonderful that he received a positive response. But Romano tells Jep that he is leaving Rome, and returning to his small hometown, from whence he had come to Rome as a young man. ""Rome has disappointed me"", he tells Jep.

This is really the insight moment for the film. The inability of someone, and that someone is almost everyone, to question their own consciousness, to in any way question or blame their own essential nature for their life, or to question their choice of an environment for themselves, much like the choice of a lover, that is toxic for them. Each person thinks they can transcend their environment and normalize their own consciousness through verbal definitions and success. Failing to do so, they blame the environment, or their own lack of effort, rather than their own consciousness and its need, like a drug addict, for that environment, no matter how toxic it may be to and devastating for them personally. Many a failed love affair travels the same path.

Jep briefly considers that he too may have exhausted his life in Rome, and that he might return to where he came from, or go on to some where else. But, in the end, Jep's consciousness is Rome. He cannot leave what he is, or go back to something he was not. Jep has become his environment, no matter how empty its charms and denizens may have become for him. If he is disappointed in Rome, it is because he is disappointed in himself. The two are inseparable. He is haunted by ""the great beauty"" of a moment in youth when all seemed possible, if only through a then youthful ignorance of life and himself. He has no where to go now but onwards, an observer of his own essential nature.

The film's Fellini like cinematic touches, which run on a steroids throughout, are in many ways busy work, lacking the organic relationship to the characters and film making that the same devices had in so many Fellini films. The film could have been made with much less overt style and have lost none of its essential nature nor any of its story impact. That is in a way a tribute to the strength of its conception and to the talents involved.

All that said, the film is gorgeous. Toni Servillo as Jep Gambardella is superb, the role of a lifetime for the actor, and all the casting and production are first rate. No other film since Fellini's has so captured the look, feel and vibe of Rome as both an open air museum and a grand movie set for the personal dramas and struggles of the creatively obsessed, jaded, cynical, malevolent and determined. The film plays like a wry dirge for an over ripe funeral procession. But it is a beautiful and, ultimately thoughtful reflection on the energy and openness of youth fading into a fragile but wise middle age. The place is intensely Rome The style is uniquely Italian, But the story is human and universal. RECOMMENDED.",1388016000,213,7617,4.803203661327231
5855679,5,B00DUD7VDI,"This is the most nostalgic Italian film since the times of Giuseppe Tornatore's Baaria. Gepp is writer who is living his autumnal ages, and so he explores with farewelll taste all those places, faces , friends, girls that accompanied him sometime but that actually are gone or like him have grown old.

""Roma has let me down"" says one of his fellow friends. The journey into the night is filled with reminsicent metaphors that calls us back to La Dolce Vita, 8 1/2, Roma and even Last year in Mariembad. The main character is closer to GianCarlo Gianini than Marcello. He walks, talks and reflects about his passions, hobbies, missing romances and how the actual world has lost part of the charm of his youth years.

Of course, there are cynical observations about the banality of society (even the Roman church is not absent).

The photography is admirable and talks by itself. And brilliant sequences that illustrate the state of despair and agonic loneliness (Giraffe's missing, for instance).

A film that highlights above the average. Good cast and magnificent custome design.

Actually I had lost the first disk that I purchased here on Amazon 4 years ago and so I ordered it again, and this second viewing was even more pleasing - thanks in part to the new, larger TV and audio surround system. Speaking of which I must say that the quality of video and audio of this (Criterion) edition are simply superb. The soundtrack is great and if for nothing else I would certainly go back to several scenes again just to listen to hi-rez music. The movie is very beautiful and kind, and watching it felt like taking time with a glass of good wine while contemplating a beautiful, tranquil scenery lying in a hammock and thinking about the vanity of life in a sanguine mood. It's beautiful, it's poignant at times, and it's a visual and audio feast. I honestly do not understand why some reviewers here could not enjoy it at all. Msybe for an action movie junkie it can seem rather slow and monotonous, but as I said this is a glass of good wine (much better actually), not a fat salty hamburger to devour and be done with.",1510099200,3,1117,4.3238095238095235

At first, I thought this raucous, decadent culture I was witnessing was of no interest to me and I did not expect to care for the film. (I was watching because one of my students recommended it.) But then I found that the central character of the film had much the same feeling about that culture. It turns out to be an investigation of the cultural dynamics, and in that sense became very interesting to me.

5855756,5,B00DUD7VDI,"I love this movie. The sound track is superb and effective at creating mood. In the opening scene, there is a chorus performing. The Great Beauty has a touch of the musical.

Spoiler alert, I have watched it a few times. I know the scenes, the characters and I understand the film. I love how the music of the next scene starts at the end of the previous one. The continuity and editing, wonderful.

Hard to believe Jep would fall for Romana. She was too naive and intellectually dense. Jep was all about intellectualism, abstract thinking, analysis. This woman was far too earthy and self absorbed, eventually we find out she is quite ill. Both characters blossomed through this short romance and at the end they may have been in love. Romano was pivotal to Jep's transformation, her departure forced him to go alone, investigate his past and find clarity.

I understand how someone would see The Great Beauty and say, what? It defines the attitude of Romans, but if you do not have this knowledge it might be difficult to understand this without having lived in Rome or having this knowledge first hand. It is an Italian thing but it is particular to this city and to this Roman ""type"". The clubs, the money, the ennui.

The Saint and the dwarf boss were the only two women, both deformed in the physical, who were confident, focused and successful. The other female characters were all beautiful but lost, searching. This made fun of the Italian obsession of the beautiful woman and how feminine beauty is adored in Rome.

Then there is the backdrop, the beauty of Rome itself. Frankly I feel there was not enough of it, there is so much to see. The film does capture the astounding light and shade, the color of the sunset against the buildings, it successfully defines the Roman attitude. The grim stuff, with any urban landscape, is cleanly edited.

While The Great Beauty appears to be about attitude and appearances I believe it is about hope and transformation for the artist and the liberation of the individual. The self, willing to face the journey alone, transcends all.",1457827200,5,2083,4.708791208791209

5855768,5,B00DUD7VDI,"The wonderful cinematography of The Great Beauty is worthy of its classical setting - and the film is more unified than it might seem after the first viewing. Performance art and magic acts are well-placed in its structure, and suit its central theme: the creation of illusions. Everything is theatre, and there is satyr's joy in satire. The Colliseum looms large in the view from Jep Gambardella's apartment - now a mockery of its ruined self, where life itself was mocked and ruined. Jep sees virtue in being conscious of his own falseness, as when he lectures his beautiful younger friend on how to act at a funeral, and repeats his words precisely at the occasion - but then shows a glimpse of unplanned emotion. So we come to the great beauty of art. Dolly shots are plentiful and nicely paced. A skewed stairway shot avoids cliches. The lighting ranges from excellent to magical, as in the nighttime tour of palatial art treasures. Tony Servillo was excellent as Jep, and the rest of the cast was wonderfully supportive, as if they were enjoying a great party.

Rome is a monument to an ancient civilization that is evident in its architecture. Among these decaying structures that have survived for centuries, people go from birth to death in an almost fleeting moment of time. In one scene our protagonist who is 65 years old looks at photos taken of a man from childhood to adulthood; his face twisted and smiling and aging right before our very eyes. These photographs capture the decay of youth such as film captures the essence of life and anything a gifted filmmaker wants to capture on celluloid. There are many moments in this film of self-indulgence which inspire imagination, while other moments are a sheer superficial pleasure. And then there are moments that penetrate the soul with philosophical reflection. In the final scenes a nun who is well over a hundred years old and looks like death is knocking at her door, makes an impression with her sense of purpose, conviction and in the end great beauty.",1445731200,,1055,4.866666666666666

5855804,5,B00DUD7VDI,"""The Great Beauty"" has been a pleasure to view over and over again.  The main character, ""Rome"" fascinating in all her glory, dilapidation and hedonistic play.  Reminiscences of: Antonioni's ""L' Eclisse"", the intense street light glow compared to the intense light that reveals an overhead airplane in ""The Great Beauty"", what a contrast in meaning and tone, Gilliam's ""Brazil"", with the wickedly ironic plastic surgery scenes have a  less frenetic pace, but same sense in the Botox scene in ""The Great Beauty"", Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" where Marcello rambles in the ruined castle with the other guests contrasts with Jep's reverential course through Rome's ancient palaces rich with beauty and mystery, so touching and so vital to the sense of what Rome no longer is.  Just sensational scenes of reverie . Of course, similarity to ""La Dolce Vita"" in that the anti-hero is a ""lost soul"".
I get the feeling that Jep (""The Great Beauty"") is more ironic and is more pragmatic than Marcello (""La Dolce Vita) ever was.  Although Jep is part of the ""In-Crowd"" he has never forgotten his search for the Great Beauty, whereas at the end of ""La Dolce Vita"" Marcello has succumbed to the existential horror of life's meaninglessness.  Jep is always observing his surroundings, other people and himself.  He maintains his sense of wonder and joy in life.  He is a complex individual not indifferent to empathy even though involved in a world of superficiality, cruelty, and meaninglessness.
In the ""The Great Beauty"" the critical view of modern ""performing arts"", as well as obstreperous artists performing for a sensation hungry audience was spot-on, what a hoot!  Just too much other good stuff to tell and so little time.
Wonderful acting, good cinematography, great story, and no I didn't find it too long either.  I was entranced the whole time and only wish I understood Italian, because I know the subtitles (too quick by the way) can't get the exact words and the in jokes are missed.

5855859,4,B00DUD7VDI,"The Great Beauty is Paolo Sorrentinos love letter to Italian cinema,Roman decadence, La Dolce Vita in the character of Jep Gambardella (Tony Servillo),who is a man,who is now 65,a journalist,who once wrote a famous first novel,who never quite fulfilled his promise, but instead came to Rome to be the king of the nightlife of endless partying, surrounded by beautiful women (of which hes bedded a few) and the upper classes,art,culture,bourgeois extravagance,happenings. He is a giddy butterfly, going from party to party,tasting the giddy nectar of hedonism. He is shewn celebrating his 65th birthday in his rooftop apartment,dancing the night away,with a great smile on his lugubrious face. Hes a flaneur,a voyeur of the beautiful young things,near-at-hand, he serves as a confidant and friend of the not-so-young,but beautifully preserved (by botox injections) of those who wish to cling on to their youth. He is haunted by his past,getting flashbacks to his youth,to the girl he truly loved. He dreams of the sea as he falls asleep glimpsed in the ceiling above his bed, a memory of a day they spent together,when he swam alone as a motorboat approached and she looked out concerned from the beach as he dived below to avoid catastrophe.

Gambardella meets early on the husband of his lost love,who brings news of her death, and he is so shaken,he takes stock of this empty life-style,giving way to more spiritual concerns. He weeps at the funeral of a friends son. Although there are more parties, visits to restaurants and night-time walks with his new stripper girl friend; soon a Mother Teresa-type figure and a cardinal,who is shaping up to be a future Pope,more interested in food than spiritual matters,begin to appear. What I would criticise in the film is a concern with beauty without object-statues and stones and fountains and marble interiors are shot caressingly. The only anchor is the ensemble cast,but chiefly Servillo as the world-weary,but sensual protagonist. There is no plot or story line,the exuberant visuals swoop and glide;the music is a mix of electro-pop and classical. The concentration on the unapologetic wealth of the  1 percenters is a bit overindulgent for my tastes. This is a Rome without its poor or its famous dark side. Style without substance? Flaubert is quoted as saying he wanted to write about nothing. Sorrentino has almost achieved this with Gambardello as his guide. Of the two great film-makers,Fellini and Antonioni,he has preferred Fellini. I think he chose the wrong one. A bit more spareness, strangeness,silence and solitude for me.",1421366400,,2589,5.161904761904762

5855874,5,B00DUD7VDI,"Sorrentino's The Great Beauty is a lovely mix of Mediterranean joie de vivre and Nordic existentialism that leaves the audience drenched in beauty and medium-heavy with melancholia. The main character, Jep (Toni Servillo), is a man of deep feeling, immersed in the timeless splendor of Roman imagery. But this is Rome at its most existential -- no bustling crowds, only Jep walking the pre-dawn streets past cafes and squares eerily empty of people. The only crowds we see float above the streets -- insulated rooftop parties of desperate and lonely jetsetters jamming into train dances to techno-pop music. This is Jeps socialite crowd, which oddly elicits in the audience both heart-felt contempt and heart-felt sympathy.

The setting reinforces the painful doubleness of Jep and his circle. The grand architecture, the magnificent sculpture and gardens, the sublime soundtrack, Jeps Roman world is filled with mind-boggling aesthetic beauty at every turn, and yet it oddly lacks the beauty of human contact, human meaning. The films continuing sideshow of performance artists grabs at this lack ever more obsessively as it fails to generate the human warmth it seeks.

As he looks back over his life on his 65th birthday, Jep himself seems intermittently attuned to all this, as scenes of heartrending poignancy pop up arbitrarily and just as arbitrarily fade into the arc of the narrative. Jep has no regrets for the socialite life hes lived, despite an awareness of its general emptiness. In his particular case, the emptiness is symbolized by the fact that he could never get back to his second novel.  One could argue that the turning point for Jep  and this film is ambiguous about this as it is about everything  is the entrance of the Santa (Giusi Merli), an old woman destined for Catholic sainthood. She is frankly an old blubbering mess and her adoration a satire on church idiocy. And yet she is more than that. Everything she says can be taken two ways. Is it senile inanity or profound genius? The best example is when she tries to tell Jep why she lives on bitter roots. Because, she stutters, half-comatose, as if she cant get her brain around the simplest question. And she seems to relinquish the effort with a dismissive remark that roots are important. It seems a throwaway line. And yet she does painstakingly climb the Spanish steps on her knees, however ridiculous that task might seem, in contrast to Jeps decades-long inability to start his second novel. And then Jep does return to his roots, at least in the space of imagination. He re-imagines his sexual awakening with a teenage girl on the beach, re-imagines a world so nave, so absurd, that full, rich human contact was possible. And that, we are led to believe amidst the lyrical beauty of the films final images, is the beginning of his second novel.",1418688000,,2835,4.922594142259414

5855912,1,B00DUD7VDI,"As a native of Rome, Italy where I spent half of my life......I feel a duty to comment on this movie.  Now,  I did not purchased it through Amazon, but I received it through my weekly disc subscription with Netflix.  Now to the movie......I have no idea how a senseless, plot less movie like this has made it to Hollywood and either won an Oscar or was nominated for one.  What really upset me was the complete lack of creativity from the creator of this piece of garbage.  It is a very wild copy of Fellini's movies.  But Fellini was a TRUE ARTIST while this one.....is almost 2hrs and 30 minutes of complete boring events.....Ok mamma said never to say anything if it has to be negative....So now to the positive......The PHOTOGRAPHY was absolutely BEAUTIFUL.  They managed to capture some very suggestive corners of ancient Rome with her beautiful fountains and Statues.  If I could,  I would give it a full 5 stars but only for the PHOTOGRAPY.  One thing that I found very true to Roman life, is that we Romans tend to be very fowl mouthed and be a little too self centered.......I honestly cannot recall a place either in Italy or the whole wide world where people are so fowl mouthed in their daily conversations like we are in Rome.....and that is not something to be proud of.  The rest of the characters belong to a very fictional Roman high society that the average Roman has never ever experienced.  So, let's recap....if you desire  to be bored to your wits for well over 2hrs....watch this movie.....On the other hand, if you think you can overlook the non existing plot and just want to enjoy views of ancient Rome, than you will be in for a real treat.  PS.....One of the actors in the movie.....the only familiar one I could recognize,  is the Italian famous comedian Carlo Verdone........I give him 5 stars as to my opinion one of the finest Italian comedians  of the late 70's 80's  90's.  Last but not least,  there are many, many Italian movies such as....Un Sacco Bello,(Fun is Beautiful), Bianco Rosso e Verdone, In viaggio con Papa', Un Americano a Roma and last but not least..Vacanze Intelligenti (Where are you going on Holiday?) that could put this one to shame.....However like all things in life. to each its own...This one made it to Hollywood thanks to very likely to great social connections and political pressure in Italy.

5855927,5,B00DUD7VDI,"We first meet Jep Gambardella, given life by the brilliant Tony Servillo (Gomorrah, Sorrentinos Il Divo), at a Berlusconi-esque bacchanal.  He has realized his youthful ambition, to be the king of the high life in the Eternal City.  His home overlooks the Coliseum at its best angle.  Rome is a giant candy jar for himand much more: it is his stage, his dreamscape, his prison, his aging process reflectedit is a serpentine, cocaine-fueled conga train in the achingly early hours; a train leading nowhere.

Once, many years ago, he wrote a successful novel, The Human Apparatus, whose title and contents are impossibly pretentious, according to a fellow socialite and frequent critic.  Gambardella, secure in his wealth and social status, takes her prodding with affected, chuckling indifference; but when pushed further, he steps out of the role of gentleman and verbally eviscerates his critic, calmly exploding her narrative of her own personal and professional success.  She leaves the gathering in tears.

In another scene, Gambardella visits an old acquaintance who manages a strip club.  The man, awed by the presence of such a famous public figure, rambles about his drug use and laments what a loser he is for having to stay awake until 6 a.m. every night at age seventy.  Gambardella listens with attention and compassion.  Later in the film, he meditates upon his own nocturnal routine, finding little of value in the endless soires that turn inevitably into long, debauched affairs.  Yet he is clearly attached to the lifestyle they represent.

Sorrentino is showing us the emptiness of life as a certain kind of Roman elite.  Tonally and stylistically, his film is entirely different from Martin Scorseses contemporary The Wolf of Wall Street, but both touch upon a certain deep vein of unhappiness and darkly comic absurdity in the lives of the amoral ultra-wealthy.  Both directors are enamored of the spectacle of excess as an almost transcendent force.  But the comparison should end there, out of respect for both films and their widely divergent ambitions.

Is Gambardellas life completely empty, debauched, irredeemable?  No.  He is a thoughtful man who endlessly wrestles to brook the contradictions within himself, to uncover the treasures in his past that will reassemble his shattered romantic soul, even as he remains suave, acerbic, self-deprecating, utterly unflappable in his public life.  Through his eyes, and Sorrentinos, we see the immense beauty of Rome: Rome as a place outside of time, in images of its Renaissance-era glories shrouded in darkness, of a drug-addled partygoer staring in awe at planes jet trails streaking through the pre-dawn sky; Rome as a thoroughfare bridging Europe and the tropics, suggested by the haunting apparition of a migrating flock of flamingos alighting on Gambardellas terrace, and a giraffe (a magicians prop) adorning the scene of a bitter parting; Rome as a place where a central paradox of Italy, and a timeless theme of humanity, plays out: the tension between the profane and the sacred, the conflicting desires to adore, celebrate, and idolize the human body and to hide it in shame, punish it, and deny its passions with spiritual poverty.

There is a rich tapestry here, and moments of enduring poignancy.  There are many superlative performances, among them Giovanna Vignola as Jeps energetic editor, the closest thing he has to a peer and a companion; and Carlo Verdone as the significantly named Romano, a struggling artist and close friend of Jeps.  The soundtrack and score are their own presence, and provide much of the films emotional power in dynamic relation with the cinematography.  There are vignettes, characters whose arcs last seconds and leave the viewer with bizarre and lingering impressions to interpret.  This is a film fully realized, and, like the warm, ephemeral memories it calls up in Jeps most vulnerable moments, like the ancient foundations of the Forum, its imprint will not fade fast.  It will inspire its viewers to write books and make films: not motivated by jealousy at the singular accomplishment of its creators, but by its affirmation of the bounties of the world and the tragedies of our time.",1408924800,3,4208,5.143906020558003

Others have described the film much better already. So only this: if you are a cinephile like me, then this is the reason why we go to the cinema. Hoping to see such a gem from time to time.

Its seeming superficiality actually is intended to resonate to the ennui and decadence of the society it depicts--Rome and Italy. It does not glorify the decline, it depicts it, to make a point.

""Why did she leave me,"" is the question he keeps asking over and over.

Now it is 40 years later and Jep is 65 years old.  He is cool and sophisticated, and the center of attention at every party and gathering.  But he lives a life without inspiration.  The endless parties are only a frenzied dance leading to death.  ""The conga lines at our parties are the best in Rome,"" he observes, ""because they don't go anywhere.""

This film takes that path, and even though I get a bit tired with late middle aged men philosophizing their life and objectifying women -which does go on in this film it was also a real reflection of the main character with no apologies or political correctness -it was life as it is for this character and his relationship to Rome.

What is so great about the film?  1. The characterization.  Jep is an articulate, thoughtful, ambitious man who is capable of insight into himself and also capable of sharing it with others.  But he is not without flaws -- apathy, vanity, overindulgence.  But he is real, and completely absorbing. 2. The portrayal of the people surrounding Jep-- their stories, their characters -- are  brilliantly done, diverse but totally coherent within the framework of the movie 3.  The photography of Rome in all its glory.  Watching the film I thought I really want to see Rome, but reflecting later, I realized I would never see it in real life, walking dusty streets, as I was given to see it here -- the aerial views, the sweeping panoramas, dropping down into the courtyards and terraces.

This award winning film from Italy (""La Grande Bellezza"") provides a gorgeous look at Rome in all it beauty and decadence in equal measure.

Since then he's been living the high life while making regular contributions to a magazine.  His circle of friends are seemingly and similarly concerned only about the next dinner party or garden gabfests.

As Jep looks back at his life, he wonders if he missed the boat.  He has no family.  His one true love was a girl he met when he first arrived in Rome at the age of 26.  He discovers that she recently died and he incurs flashbacks of their short time together.  Romantic, wistful and sad.  Brilliantly directed and co-written by Paolo Sorrentino, the film has a Felliniesqe feel and has striking similarities to ""La Dolce Vita.""

The silly extravagance is shown is several scenes of unusual art.  One involves performance art where a naked woman runs into a wall with her head.  Another has a pubescent girl provoked into anger by her father.  She then begins to toss cans of paint at a huge wall of canvass, creating a work of art worth millions of dollars.  One of my favorite scenes has Jep visiting a middle age acquaintance who has a large villa with a courtyard that displays photos taken every day of his life.  A remarkable idea.

I found the film terribly profound as I look back on life and wonder ""Is that all there is?"" echoing the Leiber and Stoller classic song.  The film won a well-deserved Oscar and Golden Globe for best foreign language film earlier this year.  Technically the film is a wonder as well.  Highly recommended.

The Blu ray version I watched was from Criterion, and to no surprise it is beautiful.  It comes with a 1080p resolution and a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  Here are some of their comments regarding the transfer:
""This new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the 35mm original camera negative. The film features a fully digital soundtrack. The 5.1 surround audio for this release was mastered in 24-bit from the original digital audio master files using Pro Tools HD.
Colorist: Andrea Orsini/Technicolor, Rome.""

The film is stunning to look at including the nighttime scenes.  Demo quality.  Likewise the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is a stunner.  The only option is Italian, but English subtitles are available.  The lossless track is well focused and very easy to follow.  The musical score is excellent (Lele Marchitelli) and comes across perfectly.  Here are the extra features:

*Conversation between Sorrentino and Italian cultural critic Antonio Monda
*New interview with actor Toni Servillo
*New interview with screenwriter Umberto Contarello
*Deleted Scenes

5855982,4,B00DUD7VDI,Delightful story with spectacular architectural treasures of Rome in nearly every seen. The story is one we all face as we become older. Did we truly live? Few of us lived to excess like the beloved main character. A movie that keeps one thinking long after the film has ended.,1402358400,,277,4.56
5855983,5,B00DUD7VDI,"Taking place over what seems to be a few days around the main character's 65th birthday, ""The Great Beauty"" illuminates life in all its wonder and complexity.  The protagonist (with the unlikely name ""Jep""), a writer whose renown rests on the success of the one book he wrote many years earlier, attends parties, spends time with friends, and experiences the ordinary events of life - there is no ""plot"" or character arc other than his admission that he has spent his life searching for ""the great beauty"" without finding it.

Throughout the long (around 2  hour) film, there are many gems of observation.  One of Jep's friends says goodbye to him upon revealing that after 40 years in Rome, the city has ""disappointed"" him, so he is leaving without saying goodbye to anyone else or even taking any of his belongings with him.  An elderly, ascetic nun who has devoted her life to caring for the poor in Africa, defends her decision to not give interviews by explaining that when one takes a vow of poverty, one does not discuss it - one lives it.  At one point, Jep learns that a woman he dated in 1970 and has not heard from since, has just died.  Her husband tells him that he broke the lock on her diary in order to read it; Jep asks if he can also read it, and the husband says that he already threw the diary away.  A man is said to have the keys to the most beautiful buildings in Rome, entrusted to him by ""princesses"" (who are shown to be elderly ladies); someone asks if he is a ""doorman,"" and he says no, he is simply ""trustworthy.""

These are only a few of the glimpses of revealed truth in the film.  The theme is supremely ironic - ""The Great Beauty"" may be one of the most beautifully photographed films I have seen in a long time - every shot is exquisitely framed and composed, but the characters seem unaware of the unspeakably lovely world they inhabit.  The outstanding soundtrack, a mix of classical and contemporary music, is often revealed to be actual music within the film's action, rather than mere ""background.""

Not recommended for everyone, ""The Great Beauty"" requires and rewards close attention.  It's an outstanding achievement and beautiful in every sense of the word.",1402185600,4,2200,4.581632653061225

5855987,4,B00DUD7VDI,"""The Great Beauty"" is a moveable feast of a movie, with beautiful visuals, stunning costumes, a killer soundtrack that will make you want to join in on the partying, and brilliant acting from Tom Servillo.

Servillo is an aging, burned out journalist who feels regret over how his life has turned out. He feels like he's trapped in a shallow world of partying, and flash, while he secretly longs for love and connection. His character, Jep, has just turned 65 and learns that his love from long ago has passed away.

He searches for truth and meaning through Rome in the rest of the film. If you've seen Frederico Fellini's movies, you will find that his fingerprints are all over the styling of this film. It's flashy, big, and bold, and has enough soul to carry it across the finish line. A real winner of a film.",1401321600,,815,4.537414965986395
5855988,3,B00DUD7VDI,"The Great Beauty was a bore...at least to me. After all, ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,""  as the saying goes. The film tries to offer wisdom in a world-weary world. All it succeeds in doing is showing terribly flawed, jaded characters on a treadmill to oblivion. As the poet John Keats wrote: ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty...."" If you are looking for truth, then ""The Great Beauty"" s no beauty of a film. But then, this is just my opinion. I recommend viewing the film and then forming your own opinion.

A colleague recommended this movie - I thought it might be filled great views of Rome, instead it is an insipid view of Rome's spoiled older 1% types in a boring story that has been done many times before.  The few views of contemporary Rome were definitely not worth the price of this movie...definitely donating it to the local public library.  Maybe some one will enjoy it, I thought it a total waste of time.  Sorry but that is my personal view.

a film to give you much to thInk about. One's senior years offer experience/insights/time impetus to do just that. Viewed at younger ages; yes, a great mind-starter too.

There is poem I recommend by William Wordsworth: IMITATIONS OF IMMORTALITY FROM EARLY CHIlDHOOD which I often revisit which conveys good thoughts to consider before or after viewing this Beauty: When you're young, experiment, make mistakes, go ahead, make a mess.

Unsaid but subtly suggested in this fine motion picture is that suggestion. To finally make sense of what it was that made it so fine. Or not. I've seen this film a few time so far, and will see it  again and again until I croak. There are many nods to Fellini and his more frantic but profound insights. In all, reconsidering life experiences helps jell it all.
(In fact, a full-lived life is full of ups and downs, all offer lessons).  This film is a fine catalyst. And in the meantime, beautiful, engaging, fascinating, bizarre, sumptuous, provocative.  And highly enjoyable.

Many scenes are located inside or outside buildings that tourists rarely see. Jep's apartment roof top which is the scene of many parties and intimate moments is directly across from the Coliseum which gives the movie a historically relevant and enduring perspective of timelessness. I never lost interest in this movie and wanted it to continue after it ended. I still find myself thinking about the dialog and layers of stories and characters that flowed through the movie like the first scene that summarizes how precious life is in the present moment.

Great story telling and cinematography, influenced by all the Grand Italian Directors and yet, uniquely Sorrentino's own masterpiece. This film, like a trip to Rome, has the feel of visiting an ancient mausoleum with a party inside, full of individual stories, and histories of those who have lived and inhabited their lives there. Like a tourist, the stories can be so easily be missed in favor of the superficial, and yet these give meaning to what could otherwise be just another forgotten photo in a drawer of a beautiful facade or statue. A good traveller isn't just a tourist, but participates with the culture it is observing.  It is quietly beautiful & touching, without being boring, or overly ""Roman-tic."" A look into what lies beneath the surface of a writer/socialite in Rome, who once wrote a masterpiece based on a grand love and has not done so since. Waiting for his next Great Beauty, his life becomes distracted by the fabulous and superficial, thinking ""it"" will never happen again, and that his life is about nothing, and nothing is impossible to write about. Despite his efforts, a crisis of age, and an innate ability to observe beneath the superficial, reveal all too well the answer to his life's constant question...I could tell you, but then it might spoil La Grande Bellezza!",1397606400,,1424,4.884297520661157
5856049,4,B00DUD7VDI,"Paolo Sorrentinos much lauded, multi award winning film about La Dolce Vita, the hedonistic, excessive, stylish  but ultimately exhausted ennui of Roman high-life is itself a feast of beautiful, empty, melancholic so what exhaustion.

The conundrum at the heart of this, is: how can you make a film about a group of sophisticated, pretentious, self-indulgent excessive artists or, more properly, for the majority, pseudo-artists, without your own art-work being subsumed into the gorgeous soft porn, sated, over-indulged luscious skin and vision-fest you are portraying.

I was not completely certain, despite the wit in the script, the gorgeousness of the vistas and especially the stunning, stylish women, which the camera lingers lovingly over, in their often naked voluptuousness, whether what I was watching was art, or merely another excuse to show beautiful women naked, and a parade of ageing powerful men clustered like vampires in a feeding frenzy round succulent female flesh.

The central character, through whose eyes we ingest Romes beauty, fiddling whilst  not necessarily Rome, but life itself, burns and is destroyed, is Jep Gambardella, a 65 year old journalist, of acerbic, mordant pen. Jep is lionised by his society, he is, as he always wanted to be, a mover and a shaker, and delights in being the sort of man who attends the best and wildest and excessive gatherings, but is not only the man who attends those parties  but the man whose dismissive words can make those parties FAIL. Once, many years ago he wrote a novel which was praised high, now he makes and unmakes reputations.

The unseen presence which stalks through the film is the grim reaper; death. Although it is hearing of the death of his first love which brings existential despair up close and personal for Jep, we see through his eyes, as he plunges into the swings and roundabouts of parties, sex, and spectacle that he (and all around) are doing this to stop awareness of the knowledge that we are all on that journey to the grave.

The film swings constantly between the overindulgence of spectacle, movement, noise and distraction, and silence, emptiness, spaciousness, some kind of surrendering acceptance, as exemplified by the presence of a 103 year old nun, soon to be canonised. However, the spectacle of the lizard-faced, decrepit nun crawling in suffering penance on hands and knees up a flight of stairs as part of her spiritual, saintly journey, is no particular solace either.

The performances, (especially Toni Servillo as Gambardella) are all impeccable, the whole filmic quality of the piece is lush, wonderful, artful, but at the end I was left looking for something which Im not certain I found  something to value, some quality of heart. In some ways, though the characters in this piece have a sophistication and finesse, and a stylish wit and brio, which makes them at least knowingly witty company, I was left with the same feeling of distaste for humankind which reading Bret Easton Elliss The Laws of Attraction gave me. And the point of that comparison, is that this is as partial and incomplete a view of humankind (very little that is kind, in this) as the other side unreal saccharine view of traditional Hollywood. This was a world peopled pretty well by only the stunningly beautiful or the Fellini-esque grotesque. It missed the extraordinary of ordinary itself.

As filmic spectacle, it is indeed splendid, but is it more than just a very finely lacquered mind-game to be dissected and debated. And is that enough?",1397347200,2,3539,5.032478632478632

As I said it was very interesting, and perhaps I wasn't too much in the mood for ""interesting.""",1397174400,2,529,4.43298969072165
5856053,5,B00DUD7VDI,"So few films really exemplify their titles the way that The Great Beauty does.

Not only is the film visually stunning, but on the flipside, the film finds ways to not only become emotionally beautiful but also exploitive of the not so beautiful moments, the moments glossed over with a beauty that is not wholly admirable or lasting.  The Great Beauty is, without a doubt, a film about life in its entirety and as such it is beautiful and ugly at the very same time.

I hate the saying they just didn't get it even though I have used it in the past.  It just feels so pass to say that the reason someone doesnt like something is because they didn't get it.  The truth of the matter is that there are times with there is nothing to get, and even at that, we all respond to films (well, life in general) in different ways and with different vantage points and so there are times when something we see in a film is not seen by others simply because, for them, it isn't there.  Who am I to say that they NEED to see the beauty in something that they so clearly dont.  For me, film is such a personal experience, and because of that I gravitate to films that find a way to touch me personally.

The Great Beauty did that for me.

The film, on the surface, is a simple one.  Jep Gambardella is a simple man of simple pleasures who has created a life of luxurious fantasy in the heart of Rome thanks to his solitary contribution to the literary world.  Held on a pedestal because of his only novel, and touted by all as an intellectual, Jep finds himself almost suddenly void of meaning upon his sixty-fifth birthday.  Despite having everything at his fingertips, and more, he begins looking at life from a very different perspective.

For me, this is where the film stakes its claim and where the beauty lies.

For a film that can appear self-indulgent and exploitive, it is this perspective that truly builds the beauty in the title.  The films point is to exploit the self-indulgent, never once claiming relation to the act.  The film never glorifies this mockery, but instead uses Jeps bewildered expressions and eventual self-sabotage as a way to build such depth of character.  Here we have a man who is used to having his way with everything and everyone basically having a midlife crisis (a few years too late) and realizing that everything hes been accustomed to is far from the beautiful life so many think it is.

Throughout the course of the film, Jep revisits the places that have held his hand, his heart and his attention  throughout his life and it is through these visitations that he begins to unlock the true beauty of his city, his memories and his life.  Weaving through images of beauty, lives of misfortune and tokens of appreciation, Jep discovers the truth behind the faade, and allows us to open our eyes alongside him.

Yes, the film is about the self-indulgent, but for me this was anything but.

With some of the most beautiful imagery Ive seen put to film, The Great Beauty is just that, beautiful.  The score settles into every scene, the sets glisten in the majestic lighting, and the core performance from Toni Servillo anchors the film in something so rich, so soulfulso beautiful.",1397088000,4,3209,4.532986111111111

5856056,2,B00DUD7VDI,"An Italian film set in beautiful Rome that won the 2014 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film - What could be better, right? I was eager to see THE GREAT BEAUTY with high expectations but I was seriously disappointed. THE GREAT BEAUTY is a rambling film that moves about in so many directions never settling on a clear story.
Jep Gambardella (a wonderful Toni Servillo) has just turned 65. In his young days, he wrote a book  that became a modern Italian literary classic. He never wrote another book and seems to live off the fame of his one success. He parties hard on the Roman night circuit but has no direction in life. He is surrounded by bitter, lonely people grasping to stay young through drugs and botox (The botox party scene drags on and on and even a nun shows up). The party scenes are numerous and  have the feel of a 70's movie.
THE GREAT BEAUTY has a cast of thousands it seems. Jep's party friends and associates and an array of characters who seem to have no purpose to the story. People pop in and out with no clear reason. A Saudi man in traditional Saudi garb is seen with a woman covered from head to toe with only her eyes showing. Later they are seen in a restaurant. The man is eating. I wondered how the woman could eat if she wanted too with her face covered. No explanation as to who these people are. We see Chinese tourists. One falls over dead and that is the end of that scene. What just happened?
Jeb works as a journalist but doesn't seem interested in interviewing anyone when the opportunity arises. One of his few friends is his boss who is a dwarf. Now there would be a story as to how this woman was able to become a successful businesswoman., but we see her in a bad wig just offering advice to Jeb.
The story seems to want to make a point that is never clear. Is Jeb regretting decisions he has made and the life he could have had? He learns that a woman he knew briefly when he was 20 considered him her only true love. Again, an interesting story point is lost here. Then there is the ""saint"" on earth who shows up looking like something from a horror film. What is going on here?
The take seems to be that life in Rome is miserable and there is a sadness and loneliness in the air. People are addicted to life in Rome yet they are unhappy but can't leave. This lovely and vibrant city does not get its rewards in this film.
This is a slow, very slow moving film that seems to get lost in its own grandeur. Paolo Sorrentino directed and wrote the film. Maybe only he understands the message of the film.
Toni Servillo as Jep is wonderful. There is no question he is an actor of quality. He's an attractive 65-year-old Jep and it's clear he must have been stunningly handsome in his youth. Women still throng to him. It's interesting that Servillo was in his early 50's playing the 65-year-old Jep.

5856074,5,B00DUD7VDI,"I saw this film in the theater and consider it one of the two or three rewarding and truly great films of 2013, not one of the said films being your Hollywood scam-films BTW. I very much look forward to seeing it again on Blu-ray. So I take it personally and feel compelled to respond to ignorant ""reviewers"" who see fit to criticize it without knowing what they are talking about at all. ""Miss Sarah"" and ""Miss Silvia"", two of the virago-""reviewers"" on this panel: You are obviously a lot smarter and have far better taste than I and the thousands of Academy Award voters who chose this wonderful film as Best Foreign Film of the year 2013. Together with ""Twelve Years A Slave"" - another NOT-A-HOLLYWOOD scam-film, but nevertheless won its highest award; such an irony indeed - it will be among a pitiful handful from 2013 that will endure.

What demoralizes me about Amazon ""reviewers"", in general and the two Misses in particular, is first, their stupidity. They openly and self-confidently confess to ""not getting it"" or ""not liking it"". Has it ever occurred to these ""reviewers"" that ""not getting it"" and ""not liking it"" are admissions of defeat, especially with regard to a film that is unmistakably serious, demanding, and complex, and therefore reflect BADLY on them?  No, they wear their stupidity like a badge of honor. Second, their circular, self-serving smugness about their stupidity: ""Because I did not get or like this film, it must therefore be 100% truly awful"" rather than it's because of me and my deficiencies as a human being and as a ""reviewer"". No, that would NEVER be the problem although when you get right down to it, that is plainly what the problem is, the frustration of a deficient mind (and heart) about a work of art that eludes them, that is beyond their intelligence and limited capacity for understanding and empathy.

I think that Amazon ""reviewers"" - myself humbly included, a very occasional ""reviewer"" at best - will always say more about themselves than what they're ""reviewing"" or writing about. The required level of understanding, openness, and dare one say it, cosmopolitanism, which is the only enlightened and useful way to approach any new work of art, is very low indeed. It's partly because Amazon is more interested in ""democracy"" rather than literacy. As such, the level of arrogance, which is usually driven by bias and provincialism, is depressingly high.

In the end, it is nothing more - and nothing less - than a reflection of the state of our contemporary culture itself, that is to say, we ourselves, who are presently living in a mediocre age. Yes, of course, movies (and all other ""media"", including books) have never been so bad. The one consolation of living in a culturally ""down"" time such as ours is precisely the very few books and films that somehow transcend the pervasive mediocrity. We will need to wait for another fifty years or so for the next Golden Age, which always happens once the culture is able to see past its technological ""advances"" and superficial marvels. In the case of the history of film, that has been the cyclical case since its inception, and there is no reason to believe otherwise, i.e., that our total absorption with Technology will inadvertently and indefinitely prevent enduring, timeless work from being made, with rare exceptions such as ""The Great Beauty"", an instant classic and a great film.",1395705600,23,3394,4.846551724137931

It begins with the tourist group surrounded by angelic voices and sublime architecture all the while missing the chance to discover the wonders of Rome themselves and instead relying on the well worn facts from their guide. The only tourist that ventures out away from the crowd succumbs to an unexpected death. Take your chances and don't miss a thing before it's too late.

A group of friends who party hard and live lavish but have nothing meaningful to show for it. Some admire each other while others despise each other but after all the desires to be acknowledged are set aside all they have is their own self respect. Sometimes they end up with less as in the case of the wealthy neighbor who goes down for white collar crime and corruption.

A religious vignette shows us a priest in line for great leadership who is interested in nothing more than the sound of his own voice and cooking techniques while being chauffeur driven around Rome and avoiding any requests for spiritual enlightenment. Meanwhile an old nun serves her fellow humans quietly and without accolades all the while struggling on her journey to serve her faith even being weighed down by the symbol she wears around her neck. Birds themselves can't even take her life as she blows them away until her gracious work is done.

Attempts to connect with old friends, casual sex that's meaningless, meaningful talks that are casual, lucrative paintings made by frustrated children, ancient hidden treasures that few will ever experience, rumour after silly rumour, younger generations losing contact with their parents and losing respect for their forefathers, disappearing giraffes, and simple lunches with people that might look small but have very big hearts round out a journey of discovery and an attempt to reveal the elusive trick.

A slow trip down the peaceful river while the camera pans to the little details that make up The Great Beauty that is Rome and life. Open your eyes because ""this is how it always ends. With death. But first there was life, hidden beneath the blah, blah, blah...""",1395705600,7,2324,4.785536159600998

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

'The Great Beauty' is the story of Jep Gambardella (Toni Servilo), an aging journalist from Rome who begins a course of self-reflection on the occasion of his 65th birthday. In his younger days, Jep was determined to become the #1 bon vivant amongst the Roman nouveau riche--and succeeded! He published one novel and like many one hit wonders, rested on his laurels and rode into middle age on the coattails of that one success. Jep sustained himself by writing occasional magazine articles with the support of his acerbic magazine editor, Dadina, a dwarf who appears to be instrumental in keeping him afloat, despite his self-doubts.

Jep faces a crisis when the husband of a woman who he briefly dated when he was 20, reports that his wife has suddenly died. This is 'The Great Beauty' of the film's title--we see her in a series of flashbacks as Jep muses on the woman 'who got away'. But 'The Great Beauty' has a double meaning--it stands for the collective soul of Rome itself--with its attendant characters, who run the gamut from the profane to the magisterial. Director Paolo Sorrentino takes us on Jep's vibrant, episodic journey, as he interacts with characters from both his past and present.

A good part of 'Beauty' is taking in the decadence--fortunately good-natured Jep is the hero here, parrying all the negative talk with the quick wit he's accumulated over the years. Some of the 'lost ones' include a pretentious performance artist who offends Jep by smashing her head into a wall and calling it art and a fellow journalist who he takes apart after she brags about her fame due to the publication of 11 novels by a low rent Marxist press. And Jep wants more from a woman who wants to show him nude photos of herself on her computer since as he says, at his age, he ""wants more.""

Jep is thrown for a loop when the 40 year old stripper daughter of a bar owner he hasn't seen for 30 years, dies of AIDS, after they strike up a friendship. While Jep advises not to cry at a funeral because it might upset the family, he does the opposite at the funeral of the disturbed son of a female friend. And when his best friend, Ramono, decides to throw in the towel, give up his playwriting career and return to his hometown, he continues to soldier on, despite his isolation.

It's really not clear what turns Jep around from his cynicism to embracing life in all its beauty (which includes despair)--I believe it's his accumulated experiences that causes him to start looking at life as a glass half full, rather than half empty. Beyond the positive, is the sense of awe--perhaps Jep experiences this when he meets the man who's taken a photograph of himself, every day of his life.

Religion comes into play at film's end, when the nun is seen taking an injection to cure her of sweaty hands (she needs dry hands to meet the Mother Theresa clone, 'The Saint'). Jep obviously is put off by all the discount Botox doctor's 'takers' including the status seeking nun. Later, the ex-Exorcist Cardinal hardly impresses as a man of faith, with his obsession with culinary delights (as opposed to devotion to spiritual matters). But 'The Saint' appears to be the real deal, as Jep is shocked to find her sleeping on his floor in his apartment. Her devotion to the poor, her sense of sacrifice, proves there's a good side to the church, despite all the failures.

Ultimately, it's Jep himself, who represents all that's good about Rome--the man who isn't afraid to look deep into his soul, plume the depths of despair and emerge triumphant. Jep's journey ends where it begins--to a moment in his youth, in all its naivety and simplicity. 'The Great Beauty' sometimes goes on for too long (not sure if I liked all the long-winded party scenes) but nonetheless, 'The Great Beauty' requires obligatory repeat viewings as there is so much food for thought in this most thoughtful, Fellini-like feast.",1395619200,3,3965,4.694964028776979

5856095,5,B00DUD7VDI,"There may be movies that provide more aesthetic bliss to the viewer (and listener) than The Great Beauty, but I doubt that any of them are as thematically rich and thought-provoking. And vice-versa! And this is appropriate, because, as one might guess from the title, one of the things this movie is about is the nature of beauty and our approach and response to it.

But it's certainly not for all tastes.

The biggest sticking point for some will be its lack of a conventional plot. There is no specific problem that confronts our hero, Jep, early in the first act and which gets resolved late in the third. It is simply the story of a man who, after his 65th birthday party, begins to gradually question his life--and even that is not telegraphed; it dawns on you slowly. You are simply watching a series of episodes in the life of a human being, and learning a great deal about him.

If that is acceptable to you, then know these things:

-- It's a visual and aural feast. The beautiful city of Rome, and the faces of a large ensemble of character actors, are lensed with, well, great beauty. And this is accompanied by a soundtrack that includes some of the most soul-stirring modern music, such as David Lang's ""I Lie"" and Arvo Part's setting of ""My Heart's in the Highlands.""

-- Not only that, but the editing style is purely cinematic, designed not to just tell a story, but to create juxtapositions that startle, soothe, illuminate.

-- It rewards repeated viewings. In fact, there are some things that will puzzle you the first time, that you'll only make sense of ten minutes after they happen (including the most important event in the movie, which happens offstage), and when you see it again, what happened will not only be clear to you, but the reason for the initial obscurity (to be true to Jep's emotional life) will be clear.

-- It is drowning in symbols, but none of them are simple and programmatic (X stands for Y); instead they are multiply suggestive. Some of the action, for instance, is portrayed as taking place in spaces that are obviously other than where they must be (the usual substitution is some exquisite locale, full of open space, for someplace mundane and cramped). That's a look inside Jep's head.

-- It has extraordinary thematic richness. I told a friend that it was ""about everything."" I can imagine an entire book devoted to exploring what it says about the human condition, and how it says it, and would not bet against that actually happening someday. (I've already spent the better part of a whole day writing about it at IMDB, after seeing it a second time.) Of course, it is not about everything equally, so here's a list of some of its main concerns: how memory haunts and shapes us, the unknowable in life, whether the world (and art) should be analyzed or just experienced, whether viewing art (in the broad sense), and hence living our lives, should be an active or passive experience.

-- After two viewings and some thought, it starts to reveal more plot than it seems to have had at first. There is, after all, a story here, involving Jep's relationships with two women, one in his past, one in the present. (It's not obviously a story the first time, any more than anything in your life is, except in retrospect.) So, yes, add the nature of love to that list.

-- It is touching, mostly melancholy, but ultimately hopeful. The ending, in fact, is very quietly transcendent.

-- It is, in places, very, very funny.

In my admittedly insanely fine-tuned ranking of my favorite films, The Great Beauty originally clocked in at #64. It jumped to #35 on its second viewing, and in my original version of this review I said I ""could easily imagine it gaining another 10 places."" In fact, on my third viewing it vaulted to #16. This is a movie for cinephiles to cherish.",1394841600,5,3822,4.612665684830633
5856096,5,B00DUD7VDI,I happened upon this movie at the theater and I was floored and awed at one the cinematography but second the storyline. It is a touching movie with hidden lessons and beautiful language. I'm sorry to see that some did not enjoy this movie. I do believe there is a certain poetic language to the film that takes emotional deciphering. A look deeper into one self and immersing one self in the beauty of the message in this movie is definitely called for.,1394755200,2,454,4.481927710843373

5856114,4,B00DUD7VDI,"Oscar-winning ""La Grande Ballezza"" (Best Foreign Film, 2014) is directed by Paolo Sorrentino (who also wrote the story and screenplay). We see the hedonism and lack of direction displayed by the privileged classes in Rome, complete with gyrating dancers, gorgeous homes, snide gossip and lavish lifestyles. Our charming hero is a one-trick pony who wrote a best seller decades ago and has been coasting on that glory ever since.

As this Fellini-esque film unfolded, I felt it was a bit too Artistic for my taste, but then, after leaving the theater, it generated a lively discussion; so it did exactly what Art is supposed to do. Now I have ordered ""La Dolce Vita"" from the library; I am number 64 in line, so I'll have to wait a bit before I can draw an informed comparison. (My thanks to the JayFlix.net participant who made this recommendation. You know who you are...)

You'll want to see:
  * Tony Servillo (""Il Divo"") the appealing 60ish lead actor who plays the disenchanted bon vivant who wryly observes all the absurdity.
  * The peek into our hero's past which may explain his detachment.
  * The skewering of affectations; at one point he rips into a woman who has been bragging about her credentials: as a woman, as a mother and as a Communist.
  * The hilarious Botox clinic (""take a number"").
  * The sight of the Colosseum, in all its bedraggled glory.
  * The ironic views of Performance Art: e.g., a nude woman with a veil over her head runs smack dab into a rock wall. She's disappointed that she wasn't able to transcend it. Audiences are consistently polite and bewildered.
  * Many views of the ancient viaduct, designed by Roman engineers and built by slaves, to deliver fresh water to the city. Even in decay, it's impressive.
  * The exposure of the religious charlatans who surround today's ""saints.""
  * The Catholic priest who was far more interested in cooking and recipes than in religion.
  * A glimpse of some of the tourist spots: museums, art galleries and impressive cityscapes.

The film is not rated, just remember it's Italian, so expect nudity (both male and female), but no sweaty bodies, car chases, gunshots or blowie uppie stuff. The photography is lovely, especially the exteriors with those historic locations.

5856145,5,B00DUD7VDI,"Collapsed in my armchair, with a few people around me, I have greatly enjoyed the latest masterpiece by Paolo Sorrentino and Tony Servillo whom it would not be an exaggeration to call the Coen brothers of Italian cinema, such is their harmony when they work together and permeate each other.
I had an inkling that it was a great movie even when some friends stated:  ... Yes, beautiful... a little slow maybe Fellinian.
The countless references to the great Federico were more than due: not too many but perhaps too few.
The story begins with the birthday of Gep Gambardella, in one of those parties in contemporary Rome that could be defined as a cast by Fellini as Woody Allen would say: a total mess, a jumble of undefined and screaming genres, suffering from delirium tremens fuelled by cocaine, heroin and alcohol, that added only bad taste to the orgies of Caligula.

A mixture of Jurassic masks of cheesy humanity willing to sacrifice everything at the altar of appearance, in a mix of genders and genres, social classes, physical and mental horrors, where the only recognizable glue is an extreme form of kitsch.

We see the princes Colonna of Calabria who are hired for a fee at dinners, the cardinals who should speak of God but dispense recipes of browned rabbits simmered with mint and fennel, a beautiful woman stripping off to pay for the treatment against the disease that will eat her up soon, an army of idlers busy doing nothing, intellectual women who have written the history of the Party, but who are best known for their work in the restrooms of the University.
Everything is phoney, everything is fake, it is the festival of appearance, of boredom, of not doing anything. It is a long advertisement to smoking, drinking, drugs and especially to the display of many little and enormously monstrous egos in search of impossible identities.
It is not possible to compare these scenes with those of three other historical films: Roma and La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life) by the great Federico Fellini, and Woody Allens pathetic spot (To Rome with Love) justified only by the fact that he wasn't given much money to shoot the film (but could he compete, on this field, with Fellini and Sorrentino? However, Woody Allen is still one of my favourite directors).
Not to mention, however, even the beautiful Caro Diario (Dear Diary) by Nanni Moretti and some scenes in the catacombs in Liliana Cavanis Al di l del bene e del male (Beyond Good and Evil).
In La dolce vita the great Fellini shows us a seemingly happy and radiant humanity in convertible sports cars and improbable night dives in the Trevi fountain: this is only the desktop of a mythical world of wretches looking for a role but condemned to immense solitude.
Evocative , sometimes wonderful, mysterious, age-old and always true magic  on the other hand  is Federico Fellinis Roma, whose traces abound in The great beauty by Paolo Sorrentino, that also gives us an extraordinary, perhaps the most valuable in absolute, database of images of the beautiful capital. It is surreal, dream-like, always depicted shortly after dawn, where the protagonist is finally alone to enjoy more than two thousand years of history, culture, art and civilization, having abandoned jugglers-monsters who pretend to live and strive to convince others that they are not dead yet.
Tony Servillo is reborn on the day of his 65th birthday: he tries to ask questions, starts to have curiosities and looks in the higher ranks of the Church for an answer that cannot be given because the Cardinals are busy saying platitudes and dispense recipes.
Then he goes back to his innocence when he was eighteen years old and deflowered by an angel girl of twenty who then left him. After that he could no longer pursue that dream and was lost in a worldliness of nothingness.
Striking and impressive is the reference to a probable Mother Teresa, who is the only character who does not speak but climbs on her knees on the steps of a staircase that never ends:
I only eat a few roots because roots are important.

A great Sorrentino, certainly one of the greatest glories of contemporary cinema.

5856146,4,B00DUD7VDI,"This is both a dizzying portrait of Rome, and a dreamlike (justly ""Fellini-esque"") character study.

Jep Gambardella (played brilliantly by Toni Servillo) is a man who once wrote a prize-winning novel. Now at age sixty-five he finds himself still wavering between his twin attractions: to the spiritual and to the carnal. He is happy but somehow unengaged with anything outside his own impressions: a charming dilettante, going to wild (or pretentious) parties, having lovers, wandering Rome, looking for ""The Great Beauty."" He longs for eternal meaning, and the transcendent, but smirks at it too. He is always almost ready to undergo a spiritual conversion, but he has to stop to savor a moment of poetic sensual beauty, or share a wicked in-joke. Near the end, trying to recapture the memory of a moment with a lost love, he names the disappointing truth, that maybe Beauty is a conjuror's ""trick."" He always maintains the novelist's prerogative to stand outside life, and this ability both liberates and traps him...

This film has moments of poetry that will shake up your brain. Film devotees MUST see it.

A question he doesn't seem to really have an answer to. Rome is filmed SO beautifully I wanted to jump on a plane  to Italy (actually, I've always wanted to do that). The comparison made in one review to the film Last Year in Mariembad escaped me at first but I began to notice some scenes that made that comment understandable. In the end, this movie stands alone.

5856168,4,B00DUD7VDI,"Many of us have seen the great epic explorations of the tattered and worn decadent post-World War Italian high society social scene done by the late director Federico Fellini. Most notably his La Dolce Vita which captured his fine sense of the absurd machinations of the high rollers with plenty of time (and lira) on their hands. That film is a direct descendent of the film under review Paolo Sorrentinos La Grande Bellezza where the leading character Jep (played by Toni Sevillo), a classic product of current Italian high society, conclusively proves that the rich and their hangers-on have not changes much in the last half century except their habits are become more exotic and expensive.

The plot, well, this kind of film really has no plot, is centered on an exploration of Jeps, well, boredom with life now that he had reached the age of sixty-five and has seen it all, heard it all, and done it all without making much of a dent in the world. Oh sure Jep (and maybe some others in his crowd) had youthful aspirations (maybe even dabbled a little in leftist politics), had written a book, maybe more but had settled into a life of bourgeois comfort and forgetfulness. While the plot may not be much the reason to watch this film, and you should, is the remarkable acting of Toni Sevillo as the faded novelist turned cultural critic bound to shoulder on in the vacuum of high society. That acting and the lush party scenes when high society breaks out are what kept my eyes riveted to the screen. A last fifteen minute or so of the seemingly mandatory attack on the powerful Roman Catholic Church in Italian life could, no, should have been cut at no lost to the great beauty of this cinematic study.",1393113600,,1709,4.621710526315789
5856169,4,B00DUD7VDI,"""The Great Beauty"" (2013 release from Italy; 137 min.) brings the story of Jeb Gambardells (played by Toni Servillo, who looks uncannily like Frank DeFord, the erstwhile Sports Illustrated writer). Jeb once upon a time (40 years ago, in fact) wrote a famous novel called ""The Human Apparatus"", and ever since he's lived on that reputation. Shortly after the movie opens (with the apparent death, never explained, of a Japanese tourist in Rome), we find ourselves at a massive party. Turns out to be Jeb's 65th birthday party from his pad overlooking the Coliseum. The music is thumbing, and at one point the crowd is doing ""La Colita"", a Macarona-reminding orchestrated dance move that is just hilarious. After that, the movie settles in and we follow Jeb along as he is getting around, or just getting on, through Rome, reflecting on his life and unfulfilled desires. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is co-written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino, best known for his 2008 film ""Il Divo"", but who most recently misfired badly with the 2011 movie ""This Must Be the Place"" (starring Sean Penn as the Cures frontman-like Robert Smith). ""The Great Beauty"" is a nice return to form then for Sorrentino. Second, the way the movie unfolds, as Jeb meets random people in random places, you cannot help but be reminded of Federico Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"", now 50 years ago. I assume that Sorrentino is paying his respect to what must be a huge influence on him as a film maker. Third, the movie works very well at times (for example, when Jeb gets to know 42 yr. old Ramona, played beautifully by Sabrina Ferilli), but at other times simply seems to meander, for me anyway. Which of course leads to my next comment that the movie is overly long. Had it been tightened by 30 min. or so, I believe the movie's focus would've benefited. Last but not least, there are some great lines in the movie that will stick with you. At some point, someone asks Jeb why he didn't write another novel after the debut instant-classic. Jeb ponders his response for a moment, and replies ""I went out too much at night. Rome makes you waste a lot of time..."", ha!

This movie has gotten a lot of accolades, including an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Movie. I am sure there is a great movie in here somewhere, but for me it was just okay. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood when I saw this, or maybe I simply can't appreciate an Italian nonsensical movie. Even though it's already available here on Amazon as an Instant Video, the movie opened just this past weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended fairly poorly (the cold weather may have been a factor). In any event, whether you have a chance to see this in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD, I suggest you check this out for yourself and draw your own conclusions as to the artistic merits of ""The Great Beauty"".",1392076800,,3057,4.607339449541285
5856170,5,B00DUD7VDI,"Jep Gambardella is a successful journalist and novelist whose only book (titled The Human Apparatus), written when he was in his 20s, was wildly successful but he has not found himself able to write another. He is admired and is wealthy, living in an apartment in Rome opposite the Coliseum. Jep is a member of a broad intellectual circle of writers, actors, directors etc who enjoy the good life and party the night away. At the start of the film, Jep is celebrating his 65th birthday, and he begins to take stock of his life. He receives new that his first love, Lorena, has died. He husband has found a diary where Stefania names Jep as the love of her life while her husband was a mere good companion.  The film takes us into Jeps life and we watch as he spends his days walking the streets of Rome, observing the life around him, and have brief affairs.  Jeps view of life comes during a voice over, as he is walking, and explains that when he came to Rome at 26, he decided that he wanted to become the king of the high life. However, he did not want to be a spectator at these parties but have the power to make them fail.

 The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) is episodic with one scene flowing into another randomly. Jeps character is very engrossing and I found his conversations and action interesting. One such scene is where his disparages, in a nice way, a fellow-writer Viola at a dinner party. One feels that his comments are on target, even if his observations are cruel.  The camera is simply an observer and watching the film you might wonder where the film is going.  Simply put, we are just observers of Jeps life.  He has an affair with Ramona, the daughter of an old friend who owns a strip club.  His daughter Romona is performing while Jep is there and together they spend a few nights together.  He takes Romona on a magical late night visit to the museums and palaces of Rome, courtesy of another friend, Stefano (Giorgio Pasotti).  She has some insight into Jep and says that his writers block is due to his life in Rome. But as quickly as Romona enters Jeps life, she disappears.  There are some comic elements in the film. Jeps editor is a smart talking woman dwarf who is also a good cook and Jep at one point is set to interview a 104-year old with two cooked teeth.

Toni Servillo is fabulous as Jep and Sabrina Ferilli (Romona) crafts a marvelous performance. One wishes she had more screen time.  The biggest star of the film would have to be the city of Rome, which is treated as a place of beauty but also a state of mind. An actor friend of Jep tells him late in the film that he is leaving Rome for his home town because he cant function any more.  Director Paolo Sorrentino has been likened to Frederico Fellini (my wife agrees) but he uses comedy more in his films than Fellini, and while The Great Beauty can be termed an updated version of La Dolce Vita, Sorrentino has his own style.  I can recall the interest and excitement with a new file by Fellini opened and I felt the same feeling anticipating The Great Beauty. I am looking forward to his films to come.",1391990400,5,3107,4.379130434782609
5856171,5,B00DUD7VDI,"There are of course many great fictional films about artists interpreting their own lives. Wild Strawberries and 8 1/2 and Annie Hall and Synechdoche NY are each (among other things) narratives about the way artists construct identity/sensibility narratives. A great recent addition to this group of films is The Great Beauty. This film and its main character are incredibly appealing as both film and main character examine the grand illusions/passions that inspire us and determine the course of our lives (something many films do) but the film and main character also have a way of deflating some of the myths we tell about our own lives in a way that humanizes both the narrative and narrator (something few films do). When we meet the main character, Jep, he is a successful journalist who is celebrating his 65th birthday in grand style among Rome's cultural elite. At first it seems he is some kind of superficial playboy/social celebrity who lives for the limelight (and he is that, in part) but as the film progresses we learn he is also a man of substance and sensibility and the film becomes an examination of that substance/sensibility, an examination of how hecame to live the life he now lives. We learn that he enjoyed/suffered early love as well as early success as a novelist but that for reasons not wholly explained neither love nor artistic success were what he had imagined them to be. Although this film is full of intriguing ambiguities (that lend it its allure and cast all life events/decisions in a twilight of indeterminancy) it would seem that he was not cut out for life as others have imagined and lived it and instead of living for the love of one woman or living the life of the artist he became a connoisseur of life, a flaneur, a journalist who walks round the edges of life and who peaks across many thresholds but never fully enters into any relationships that might compromise his independence. He interviews and analyzes and interprets other artists and assesses other people's lives and ambitions, passions and illusions (and he is especially good at this because he seems to have no illusions of his own). He is applauded for his cultural insights and social graces and he enjoys this vocation as it allows him to exercise and express his sensibility and share his great powers of observation with a very select public but does not require him to do any more than observe life (and this more than any single love or artistic aspiration seems to be the great enduring passion of his life). Jep sizes up all those he comes into contact with but no one he comes into contact with is as fully-formed as he is and so no one he comes into contact with is in any position to size him up. That is our job. And it is no easy task. Even for Jep.

The Great Beauty is a great film about identity/sensibility and the illusions people sometimes carry with them for their entire lives that contribute to that identity/sensibility and its also a film about people who discover (sometimes early, sometimes late in life) that their story gets more interesting not less so when they let go of their illusions about life and about themselves (even though everyone, it seems, holds on to at least one). Jep for instance is smart enough to know he is not a great novelist or even a very good one but in a way this realization, painful as it must have been, must also have come as a kind of relief, a kind of permission to enjoy life instead of suffer through it as most artists do. He does write for a living but he doesn't write fiction nor autobiography (nor any combination thereof), he just writes about cultural figures and usually in an entertaining way for an elite and discerning readership. What he has a harder time coming to terms with is the memory of that one great love (a love that seems to have lasted only as long as one of those impossibly long and impossibly dreamy late-summer afternoons). This memory (or dream) of love that he revisits over and over again is the source of his greatest joy but also the source of much uncertainty, much unresolved (and perhaps irresolvable) wonder. The fact that he can never quite come to terms with it perhaps explains why he became who he is as much as anything else. It may even be that he needs this mystery, this illusion, and that he cultivates it, protects it, as if it were his secret core, his sustaining dream. It doesn't sound like much of a life or story but his take on things is so clear-sighted (in regards to everything besides love) its hard to resist. Even though no life is perfectly lived it would seem that Jep has found the life best suited for that sensibility he so values. Of course no one is absolutely certain of their life choices (and narrative constructions) and this film is about that too and thats, in the end, what gives this film, and life, its heart and mystery.",1391472000,,4873,4.6075949367088604
5856172,1,B00DUD7VDI,"This movie is the lowest common denominator of all the outrageous things in Fellini, Mondo Cane, and similar Italian movies.  It's main theme is to shock or surprise, but not too much of course, and everything that isn't ""weird"" looks like it should be on a Hallmark card.  Of course there is no real plot or characterization, and nothing really beautiful or noteworthy in the images, although they are, of course, scenic.  A real cheap rip off.",1391040000,10,445,4.753246753246753
5856173,5,B00DUD7VDI,"What's not to like?  This pastiche of Italian films, including among many references, the boat scene from L' Avventura, Vittorio Gassman on the diving board in C'eravamo tanto amati, and  the inane  terrace conversation of La Terrazza,  is a feast for the eyes although when watching on a small screen, many frames are too dark and the credits are unreadable.  Best of all is the genuine glow on Toni Servillo's face as he meets the Ever Magnificent Fanny Ardant walking down a staircase.

But aside from the glitter, film references  and visual jokes,  what's  the message?  We're supposed to pity the empty lives of Rome's upper whatever percent? Even their  glorious Rome is empty.  We're supposed to feel compassion for the poor impoverished nobles who must rent themselves out as ""VIPs""  for $250/person (food and wine included) an evening?  Doesn't work. To me, after 60 years of watching Italian films, this one continues the long list of Italian bittersweet shrugs at reality.  How could I give it fewer than 5 stars?",1390867200,5,1025,4.912280701754386

8597825,5,B00DUD7VDI,"I was so taken by this lively and thoughtful Italian film that I watched it two nights in a row. A fitting homage to Fellini, it is nearly impossible not see a resemblance to La Dolce Vita, (as well as the nostalgic touches of Roma, Amarcord, even Nights of Cabiria) but director Paolo Sorrentino superbly keeps Fellini as a touchstone and makes the film uniquely his own. The story of Jep (a memorable Toni Servillo), a one-hit writer, coasting on it's success to become a fixture of high society until his 65th birthday party brings him to reflect on life, love, and mortality. His cynical and existential nature makes him a perfect (and entertaining) observer of the stagnant upper class, the decaying art scene, and the beautiful mysteries taken for granted, hidden in plain sight and in our memories. Time marches on and Rome is ""The Eternal City"". The lush, saturated photography and remarkable haunting soundtrack effectively capture the wild parties, colourful characters, and many spiritual set pieces. This Oscar winner is one of the best foreign language films in years, and is highly recommended if you enjoyed Sorrentino's The Young Pope, the films of Pedro Almodovar,...and Fellini -of course. Criterion's edition contains both a fine looking Blu-ray and DVD and a lengthy amount of interviews.",1525737600,,1308,5.060185185185185
8597826,5,B00DUD7VDI,"I made the mistake of watching it near bedtime, and theres no intermittent dozing for this one.  So I started from the beginning today, uninterrupted, and became a huge fan. One caveat: In the first go-round, because it was so different, I felt a bit confused and, maybe even out of my depth, not really getting it.  This is an extravagant film with in-your-face, opulent imagery, dynamic music and dance, and glammed-out characters. Its something of a grand kinetic art installation. And it begins with no dialogue. The best approach, I think, is to suspend judgment and allow the uniqueness and exuberance to take you on a virtual ride. When the dialogue begins,  we learn all about Jep Gambardella, brilliantly played by Toni Servillo.  Hes a journalist, who wrote one minimally-acclaimed novel 40 years ago.  He views himself as an intellectual and singular arbiter of good taste, and has played hard in Romes society party life for at least that long.  Hes immensely charismatic, and his peers pay rapt attention, and so do we, to his every word.  Hes disdainful of the societal poseurs, the fakers, who reference Proust, and self-tan and botox, and he causes folks to sweat a bit when he offers up his unsolicited analysis of their lives. Especially since turning 65, he wants more. He has existential questions.  Hes more impatient with dishonesty, arrogance and supercilious posturing, and uses his ascerbic tongue to cut through the blah blah blah (as he calls it).  He finds his down-to-earth stripper gf infinitely better company than any upper-crustie type.  He now seeks out spiritual answers from religious figures, and beautifully interwoven in the storyline, are images of nuns in flowing white habits, often singing, providing really interesting counterpoint to the flamboyant partygoers and their music. The acting is excellent, across the board. The film is a striking display of first-rate, creative cinematography (Luca Bigazzi) and editing (Cristiano Travaglioli). The music (Lele Marchitelli) is wide-ranging, multi-modal, from boldly, sensually percussive, accompanying multitudes of dancers in all formations, to gently, sweetly transportive, sometimes melancholy, liturgical. Hardy praise to the production design, art, and special effects departments, and to the many other creative contributors. And best of all, to the amazing Paolo Sorrentino, who directed the film and co-authored it with Umberto Contarello.",1523145600,,2439,5.377952755905512
