The title role of Osen is played by the endearingly charming Yu Aoi, whose lightness of spirit suits the character of a highly functioning lush who runs a long-established, highly respected restaurant known for its traditional Japanese cuisine.

Set in wooden house surrounded by ornamental as well as kitchen gardens (they grow their own vegetables), supposedly located in one of Tokyo's less developed wards, the restaurant staff practices traditional cooking methods---to the extent of cooking rice over straw-fed fire, making its own miso from scratch, and simmering a radish dish for five hours to preserve its shape and deepen the flavor.

All these details are embedded in the story lines---which are often rather wacky but in an entertaining way. The acting style is deliberately of the exaggerated kind---especially when characters are tasting food---just go with it and you'll have fun.

For kimono lovers, this is a visual feast as Osen wears mostly vintage kimono in exuberant colors, designs and combinations.

A word of caution about the subtitles. In the version I purchased (from a seller other than Amazon) the first disc had acceptable English subs, but the second and third discs were obviously translated by another person, as the quality of English severely deteriorated. It was still understandable, but just---you need patience to sort out what is being said. However, if you are interested in traditional Japanese food, this is a set worth having.",1468886400,,1644,5.192452830188679
8539086,5,B009B0R63Y,"Because the auther of the original ""MANGA"" version of ""OSEN"" was upset that TV ""OSEN"" was nothing like the original ""MANGA"", the DVD weren't published in Japan and thus no rerun on TV.
I'm quite happy to find DVD of ""OSEN"" and I recommend to have one to anybody.",1433462400,,262,4.36734693877551
