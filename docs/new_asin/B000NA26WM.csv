8176415,2,B000NA26WM,"I didn't think ""Lescaut"" was one of Puccini's gems so I was attracted to the cheap price just to see if my opinion was valid. It is. This was Puccini's first ""hit"", but don't expect it to be of the stature of ""Boheme"", ""Tosca"" or ""Butterfly"" or even ""The Girl of the West""; it's pretty cheesy.

The story is pretty thin and tawdry and the music sounds like Puccini, but has perhaps two or there really good arias. The story is sort of a poor version of 'La Traviata"" with mostly unsympathetic and or stupid characters and without the many great arias. The last act in which Manon dies takes place on a desert in Louisiana ; It does not explain exactly how Manon and Des Grieux wind up there, but as a former long time resident of Louisiana, I can tell you that there ""aint"" no desert in Louisiana; it is mostly water.

The thin musical material is not compensated for by a great performance. The sets are minimal and look like cardboard mock-ups; the third act ""desert"" is an amber backdrop, a tan stage covered with large rocks and boulders. The costumes were fine and looked appropriate  for the time and place.

The acting was mediocre, the leering geezers in Act II and the parade of prostitutes in Act III were so much of a ""campy"" scene that it caused me  to  laugh. The singing and acting were Ok as were the orchestral, choral work and conducting. The ""Manon"" sings well enough, but she is not of sufficient stature or glamorous enough to make one believe she is essentially an elegant "" kept woman"" of the time. The picture was old 4:3 ratio in monophonic, bass deficient sound. Odd for a Blu Ray disc....no dts 5.1 sound here. The video itself looked pretty good.

The sets were minimal and looked like different versions of the same cardboard cut-out in each act, as you might expect in summer festival performance where funds are usually not in great abundance; The final act in the ""Louisiana desert"" looked like an amber backdrop, a tan painted stage and a bunch of large rock and small boulders.

As the old adage goes, ""you usually get what you pay for."" In this case it is absolutely true. If you really like this ""potboiler"" of an opera. I am sure that there are better discs that off offer better performance and up to date wide screen video and sound 5.1 surround sound, but probably for more ""geld"".",1454630400,,2320,4.481042654028436
8176416,1,B000NA26WM,"The sound is dreadful and overbiased....for those familiar with Angel Records (classical label) it has that typical ""blown out"" sound from too much signal (overbiasing) that destroys the audio - particularly during choral tuttis or loud solos. In addition, there is nearly no lower frequencies (all mids and highs).  This is most definitely NOT what a blu-ray should be.  The video has also been ""softened"" with filters that ruins the clarity of the video.  Bad form Kultur!  Do Not Buy This One.  Performances are just okay.",1454198400,,525,5.058139534883721
8176417,1,B000NA26WM,The original DVD version was in stereo but this is in mono. This is a manufacturing problem by Kultur/Warner (they are identical). I had the exact same problem with their blue-ray issues of Don Carlos  and The Makropulos Case - mono sound.,1400371200,8,239,4.690476190476191
8176418,5,B000NA26WM,"I was pleasantly surprised by the power of this recording. Neither Nitescu nor Denniston appears very often in this country, although she debuted at the Met in the role of Donna Anna in 2004. Her performance is truly transcendent, especially in the fourth act ""Perduta, sola, abbandonata"". Denniston is a true spinto tenore; his trumpet like voice is ideally suited for the role of DeGrieux. John Eliot Gardiner conducts with sensitivity and power. I am at a loss to understand some of the reviews. Patrick Denniston is anything but short, while Adina Nitescu is. And the music for this opera is mediocre?!I do agree that the orchestral and vocal parts are sometimes out of balance, making it difficult to settle on one volume setting. But if you are a fan of Puccini's lyrical, romantic style, this recording is a must.",1379721600,,820,4.864285714285714
8176419,1,B000NA26WM,"... to rescue the music of Manon Lescaut, Puccini's earliest success, from mediocrity. I had hopes that John Eliot Gardiner, with the London Philharmonic and the Glyndebourne Chorus, could make me revise my opinion of this opera, make me recognize the qualities that have kept fresh it in the repertoire when so many excellent operas by other composers have fallen into desuetude. But no. The music is mediocre, and that's that. There are only so many 'slots' to be filled in the calendars of opera houses worldwide, and to plug one of them with Manon Lescaut is simply a waste.

However, DVDs of operas are another matter entirely, and on that basis again I had hopes that this production at Glydebourne would at least be at the high standard of most other productions there. Another disappointment! The staging is sparse and dull; okay, I can tolerate sparse staging. The acoustics are badly imbalanced and the singers sound muffled; okay, that's so common a problem of opera DVDs that I have pnly to grin and bear it. But Adina Nitescu, as Manon, is an outrage. Even on a CD sound-only, her singing would be unimpressive and lacking in any affective nuance. But in a visual presentation -- a DVD of an opera is a FILM, even when it's filmed as a live staging -- Nitescu is hopelessly unappealing. She's simply not glamorous enough to make Manon plausible. Lack of attractiveness could be overcome, to be sure, by passionate singing and capable physical acting, but Nitescu is inert, unresponsive to any physical cues from her male associates. Even if I loved this opera, which obviously I don't, her leaden performance would spoil it for me.",1280793600,6,1644,4.809187279151944
8176420,4,B000NA26WM,"This Glyndebourne production of Manon Lescaut is satisfactory in all respects, but I couldn't relate to Adina Nitescu as Manon.  Maybe it was her acting; I don't know, she didn't fit the part for me.  Although she sang well enough, she kept not looking at des Grieux when singing.

Patrick Denniston, on the other hand, was a very good des Grieux and he got better as the opera progressed, both in singing and acting. All my stars go to his performance.

Paolo Montarsolo played Geronte di Ravoir totally besotted, wearing an idiotic grin as he proudly showed her off to his lecherous friends.  This group was particularly creepy.  I don't recall any other production where any attention was actually paid to these gawker friends of Geronte.  But there was a focus on each individual as they greeted Manon.  One of them actually licked her hand.

The rest of the cast did not leave any impression.  Except the bad girls at le Havre, of course. They were the usual caricatures of floozies and trollops.

The set for this production was of the minimalist sort.  The same background folded in various dimensions as the scenes changed, with doors appearing where needed. The desert scene (outside New Orleans!!!) looked like a badly designed Zen garden, with rocks placed every few feet.

John Eliot Gardiner and the London Philharmonic Orchestra played the score beautifully.  Puccini's music is dramatic and passionate.

Overall, this is a winner.  If you can't get enough of Manon Lescaut, here is another one.",1195689600,10,1509,4.905138339920948
