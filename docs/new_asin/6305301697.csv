1009345,4,6305301697,"This a landmark film carefully filmed in the middle of the Weimar Republic Walter Ruttman built this gem movie .

This is a great documentary . Berlin seen in perspective under the lyric gaze of Ruttman , unfolding from dawn until midnight . The film captures the basic insights of this multi facet city .

Who can deny this film inspired to Win Wenders to make sixty years after his memorable The sky above Berlin , best known as Wings of Desire?",1103673600,3,447,4.439024390243903
1009346,5,6305301697,"Pioneering German director Walther Ruttman weaves a beautiful , rapturous look at Berlin during the height of the Weimar Republic.  Everyday life is captured and extolled, from the heights of wealth to the nobility of labor, along with the splendor of modernity, from vast, efficient factories (which still look impressive) to the leggy glamour girls of the capital city's globally notorious nightlife.  Most of all, though, there's the immense artistic vision of the director, piling on one perfectly composed, poetically thoughtful shot after another, rhythmically editing them together in a groundbreaking montage style.  ""Berlin"" was indeed a seminal film; numerous other ""city symphonies"" proliferated in its wake, and the music-montage style is clearly echoed in Godfrey Reggio's ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" and its sucessors, ""Powaqqatsi"" and ""Baraka.""  This is where it all started -- a masterful and fascinating film, and a nice glimpse at life in one of Europe's greatest cities.  Pity, then, that Ruttman went on to become a Nazi propagandist, and died making films for the Reich during WWII, although really, I suppose it was inevitable.",1039478400,9,1138,5.48
1009347,5,6305301697,"This fascinating documentary shows us virtually everything that happened in the city of Berlin during the course of one day in 1927 -- without the benefit of a soundtrack, of course, but this is no handicap at all.  Almost every filmmaker who sees this film is inspired to make an imitation of it, and you will understand why when you see it.  Nothing better in this vein has ever been done.  A must-see.",996969600,8,404,4.506849315068493
1009348,5,6305301697,"Berlin, Symphony of a Great City is a dazzling film full of wonderful images. It starts with a train journey into Berlin, a journey with a real sense of speed and the thundering of the tracks. This speed continues throughout the film through the use of fast paced editing. If there is a story to the film, it is simply a day in the life of the city. The film starts with the morning and ends with night and in between shows how Berliners went about their daily lives. The focus is not on the great buildings, the famous Berlin landmarks, but on the streets where people lived and worked. Thus the film is no travelogue of tourist destinations, but rather an experience of the Berlin which Berliners saw every day.
This film has gained something since it was made. It has gained poignancy because the Berlin it shows is now lost. Anyone who has seen photos of Berlin in 1945 will realise that almost all the buildings in Berlin, Symphony of a Great City have less than twenty years left to live. The same can be said for many of the people. While watching the film, and especially scenes of happy schoolchildren, I kept wondering what happened to them. There is a joy in this Berlin of the twenties. It looks like a fine place to live, but these people and this city are about to enter a nightmare. There is something quite moving about this.
The print used for the Image DVD is very good. The black and white images are clear and detailed and there is hardly any apparent damage. Music is especially important with a film described as a symphony and the music composed by Timothy Brock adds a great deal to the film. It fits in well with the action and the various moods of the film. The DVD also includes a short film by the same director as Berlin, Symphony of a Great City. Opus 1 is a bizarre little film consisting of abstract shapes interacting with each other. It is hand-coloured and actually rather beautiful and hypnotic.",996710400,41,1931,4.4576271186440675
1009349,4,6305301697,"Berlin: Symphony of a Great City ranks with Dziga Vertov's ""Man with a Movie Camera"" as one of the great non-narrative documentaries: an attempt to capture the pulse and life of a place and time through visual  nuance.  This film is full of visual cliches--but it's immediately obvious  that this is the film that CREATED the visions that later became cliche.  It is incredible to see the Berlin of 1922 bustling before you like peeking  through a time machine.  The camera keeps moving, pulling us along.  I  loved it.  ""Opus"" is interesting, but at ten minutes too long.",926640000,12,572,4.755102040816326

1009549,4,6305301697,"Walther Ruttman's Berlin: Symphony of a Great City is a fantastic work of art that paints a slice of daily life in the city of Berlin during the Weimar Republic in Germany. We observe through Ruttman's lens what Berlin looked like in neighborhoods both good and not so good. The film does a magnificent job of portraying Berlin as a living organism; but it's equally amazing to see Berliners going about their day and enjoying the night in this little masterpiece. Moreover, the film moves along at a very good pace; Ruttman's captivating work is brilliant and the musical score enhances the film.  I must note that with this edition of Berlin: Symphony of a Great City there is one notable difference: this has a solo piano musical score and not the orchestral score. I think the orchestral score is better; it adds to the powerful effect of the film.

At the beginning of this five part documentary, (which is in five parts called ""acts""), we experience a train coming into Berlin. This viewer was treated to the sights of several Berlin streets as early as five o'clock in the morning before hardly anyone is even awake. Ruttman's ""symphony,"" his marriage of silent footage with that musical score, becomes more elaborate as we see people wake up, do morning chores and then go to work. Young children walk to school and meet each other to say hello just before entering the school.

As the ""symphony"" progresses even further, it becomes an even more beautiful and sensitive medley of just about all aspects of Berlin life in 1927--for example, we see factory workers using mechanical assembly lines to bottle milk and there are fantastic images of hotels with beautiful lobbies. People socialize over lunch or perhaps are seen eating a typical German style lunch at a caf. There are images of busy Berlin streets with traffic cops and the store windows are full of merchandise all designed to attract customers. Among other things, the film eventually shows us workers going home at the end of the workday and the footage of people enjoying Berlin's nightlife fascinated me.

As many have written, this film is now quite important because it shows a city completely lost by the end of World War Two. I, too, wondered what became of many of the Berliners in this film--did they survive the war? The two or three times the camera caught images of Jews walking down the street or wheeling out a cart to sell fruit during the day made me shudder because I knew what was in store for them.

I'll leave out the rest so that you can experience this picture and enjoy it to the extent that I did. I will add that you'll likely be glued to the screen; it's all so well done. In addition, Opus 1 is an unusual yet interesting example of German avant-garde film; it's a great bonus feature and the music enhances the handsomely hand-colored, somewhat abstract shapes dancing across the screen.

I recommend Berlin: Symphony of a Great City for people interested in the history of Germany especially before World War Two and fans of Walther Ruttman. In addition, people who appreciate historical documentaries will not be disappointed.",1355529600,2,3127,4.760147601476015

1009551,5,6305301697,"The film displays the filmmaker's knowledge of Soviet montage theory. It portrays the life of a city, mainly through visual impressions in a semi-documentary style, without a narrative content. Shots and scenes are cut together based on relationships of image, motion, point of view and thematic content. It's interesting to note that there many parallels exist between this film and Vertov's 1929 Man with a Movie Camera.

The events of the film are arranged to simulate the passage of a single day. The film is divided into five acts and each act is announced through a title card at the beginning and end. Much of the motion in the film and many of the scene transitions are built around the motion of trains and streetcars.

Berlin: Symphony of a Great City could seem superficial because of its interest in the aesthetics of the city at the expense of its human element and because it doesn't show a more detailed portrait of Berlin. Ruttmann was interested in the dynamism of movement and shapes and he aimed at making the viewer experience Berlin phenomenologically. He relies on editing, on a montage based on analogy and contrast to infuse the film with dynamism.",1337126400,,1172,4.855

The quality of the film is very good and I am happy with it. My dissapointment was that the included soundtrack is a single piano playing and not a orchestra. Other reviews of this product ""talked"" about the orchestral accompaniment so I was not expecting the piano soundtrack that is on the disc.

I feel the orchestral soundtrack adds much more to the film, so my review is 3 stars.",1320105600,4,484,4.616279069767442
1009554,5,6305301697,"I have long loved this DVD of Ruttmann's masterpiece with Timothy Brock's orchestral score, not only because it was the version I first discovered this great film with, but because I find Brock's score strongly compelling, atmospheric, and poignant....hauntingly beautiful, in fact.

But this film does indeed exist on DVD with a reconstruction of Meisel's original orchestral score.  It seems to have been available since around 2008.  Unfortunately for viewers in DVD region 1, so far as I can tell it's only available on a German region 2 DVD issued by Filmmuseum Mnchen.  The particular issue is indicated as ""Edition filmmuseum 39.""  The film itself has been restored, cleaned-up, and transferred in a cleaner, sharper manner than the U.S edition featured here, but more importantly, it features Meisel's score.  I'm not quite sure if the orchestration is the original one, or if somebody had to re-orchestrate it in modern times, as information about the project has been difficult to find online.  But it is available.  It's actually a two-disc set featuring all Ruttman's films, including Die Melodie der Welt, and all his short films and commercials (presumably shown originally in the cinemas between features).  Fascinating stuff, and it's for the sake of items like this that I make sure I always have a region-free DVD player that converts PAL format to NTSC.  I strongly suggest people interested in this sort of thing do the same, as they're not all that difficult to get or expensive now.

The Filmmuseum Mnchen double DVD set can be found on some websites featuring foreign DVDs.  I got mine from a French website called ""Potemkine,"" and I've since found it available at a site called ""Center for Visual Music"" that deals in all sorts of interesting art and abstract films on DVDs, both domestic and foreign.",1318896000,2,1825,5.026578073089701

1009675,4,6305301697,"An experimental film in its day, and still today, BERLIN: SYMPHONY OF A GREAT CITY is presented as one day in the life of the city--Berlin, in 1929. In fact, the footage was taken over a longer period of time, and evidence of every season of the year is seen in the film's ""movements."" Less interested in story-telling than in matching shapes and shades to create a unified portrait of the city, Walter Ruttman assembles his images according to the rhythms of the day, beginning with a train arrival in Berlin, following with dawn and the start of the work day, the midday break, afternoon work, after-work recreation, and nightlife. The film is characterized by occasional social comment and ironic juxtapositions, some of which are all the more poignant to modern viewers, who know what Berlin would become in the years that followed. Absorbing viewing--a frozen moment in time, and a portrait of a relatively calm Germany in the lull between two catastrophic storms.",1214870400,,969,4.914634146341464

1009677,5,6305301697,"I RECOMEND EVERYBODY THIS DVD TOGETHER WITH A CD THAT THE CATALAN MUSICIANS GROUP PEGASUS COMPOSED IN 1986 TO HOMAGE THIS FILM. I SAW THIS FILM IN 1986 AND HAVE'NT SEEN IT AGAIN. NOW I BOUGHT THE FILM AND WILL PLAY IT SYNCHRONIZED WITH PEGASUS THEMES. YOU CAN READ BELOW INFO FROM IT.
Almost sixty years ago, a writer, Carl Mayer, and a moviemaker, Walter Ruttmann, had the happy occurrence to dedicate a filmed portrait of their own town, Berlin. They wanted to exalt it in an ""images melody"" to pick up all its movements and vital impulse.
That is how Berlin: symphony of a big city, was born, where rhythms and oscillations of the urban activity, get fused into a series of inspired musical/visual movements.
As fearless in concept as bright in resolution, nobody since then has been able to overcome this beautiful avant-garde film, that remains one of the great creative successes of silent movies.
Silent but not deaf. As well as Napoleon, which discovery had dazzled everybody, Metropolis, returned recently to the young audiences, Berlin: symphony of a big city did not stay as a cinematheque's curiosity, but has preserved a forceful modernity.
That is why the Setmana Internacional de Cinema (1986) is proud to present the personal version of Berlin: symphony of a big city that PEGASUS themes with images of Ruttmann, opens not only a dimension that goes over the film and the record, but proves the universality of cinema and music beyond time.

1009680,5,6305301697,"Until I saw this movie, I could never imagine a ""visual symphony.""  This film is exactly that.  The film brilliantly shows a day in Berlin in 1927 from such overwhelmingly different perspectives that you actually believe that you were there.  This silent film -- without any written dialogue -- starts on a train moving quickly into Berlin in the early morning hours.  The city is still dark and quiet, with few cats and dogs, and fewer people, about.  Then, the city picks up its pace: children go to school; shopkeepers open their shops; factory machines start up.  Through lunchtime, through the afternoon: one quick shot after another: newspaper headlines, shop windows, an anarchist on a platform, men and women, old and young.  Into the evening -- the city slows down, but the nightlife picks up.

Berlin in 1927 would easily have been ranked one of the top five cities in the world. You get to see it before the Nazi era, and before much of it was destroyed in World War II.  You simply cannot take your eyes off this film.  The music only enhances the experience -- slow music for lunchtime, exciting music for grinding machines.

And don't miss the extra feature, a short called Opus I.  It is essentially abstract shapes moving, pulsing, and disappearing, to music.  This short was hand painted, frame by frame.  It is very unusual and, like all abstract art, different people will see different things in it.

1009681,5,6305301697,"Watching this outstanding film is like travelling back in time to Berlin of 1927, experiencing it as a visitor or as a native Berliner would, with views, insights and glimpses of street scenes, restaurants, shops, trains, stations and many more.  In a carefully arranged sequence, the film begins with a train ride into the city as a passenger would see it, then we see empty streets as the city awakens to a new day.  Each short scene captures a piece of everyday life in the metropolis; from pidgeons on the street and a meandering cat to a couple of quarrelling men on a busy street.  The style of this early documentary often reminded me of some famous Soviet Avant-Garde films such as ""The End of St Petersburg"" and ""Earth"" in that the pictures, camera angles and varying speeds of presenting a sequence of images create a drama, a feeling, thereby making this much more than just a collage of city scenes.  A perfectly suited orchestral score composed by Timothy Brock completes the experience.  Director Walther Ruttmann has truly managed to capture the essence of Berlin in 1927 in this one hour film which is divided into five acts; from early morning in the first, to night life in the fifth act, making you feel as if you really have visited pre-war Berlin for a day.  This becomes even more poignant when you consider that the city was largely destroyed by bombs during World War II, and that this marvellous film allows a unique travel experience to a long-lost time and place.  Picture quality is excellent as well, and for any lover of history and travel, as well as of film making in general, this DVD is a must.",1108339200,11,1628,4.631944444444445

This film is a beautifully designed black & white film that starts out with a steam engine train ride. We then travel through the city and through the different hours of the day until evening when we must leave. Try to spot the main streets and buildings. It is like taking a day trip into history.

Some of the details cover the technology of the day; we see overhead trains and street trolleys. Many of the factory machines are belt driven. Some of the technology has survived till today as the cappuccino machine.

We also get a glimpse of the different social strata and what people do throughout the day from waking up to school or secretarial work. Then it is off to lunch and afternoon activates.

In the evening we can go to the movies and watch Tom Mix. Or there are chorus lines and legitimate theater. Later we can stop off at the local bar or nightclub fro a drink and some dancing.

The music score is by Timothy Brock. The same person that wrote the score for ""Liebe der Jeanne Ney, Die"" (1927)
