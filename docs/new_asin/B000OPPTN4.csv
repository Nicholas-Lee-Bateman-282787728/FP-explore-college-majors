2798850,3,B000OPPTN4,"This one had mixed reviews from critics and that included me! I really loved nearly all the works of Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki-san (or Mr. Miyazaki's son rather!) but this one is a bit of a let down. The plot started with good and interesting scenes, until the mid-plot came...it kind of dragged, festered with unnecessary and boring scenes that could have been replaced with exciting signature ""Miyazaki climax"" that we know and love.
The music had the consistency of a blinking old bulb from your basement. I thought they lacked on this department as well since you will barely recall that it had musical scores after watching this piece..meh.
To end my rant, I'd say this one is a must rent not own movie from Studio Ghibli.",1241913600,8,728,4.6953125
2798851,5,B000OPPTN4,"This year has spawned a serious discussion on 2007's most important anime creation , Tales from Earthsea.
Problem is , Tales from Earthsea is produced during a time when copying is regarded as blasphemous , with the justification that the slightest resemblance to a violation of copyright issues , should be subjected to capital punishment , and cruelly so if truth promoting programmes are being created.
Thus said , the producers of Tales from Earthsea , are what seems to me , in a state of total disagreement on the consequences of what is going to take place once the product gets continued. Re - productions of ancient manuscripts and books through copying was the very reason for how and why their continuance survived such horrors as the Dark Ages. The religious fervor which has resulted from the belief that reproduction of copyrighted material in some form is to be rendered punishable by cruel means , has caused many anime directors to cease considering re - producing their films , which has resulted in the discontinuance of reproduction of famous Japanese anime films such as the less known Urotsukidoji quadrology.
It was produced during the golden age or era of the NWO , and nobody knows so far what is going to take place once further attempts get made to put people through the effort of producing new versionf of Tales from Earthsea. This anime is a reproduction  of the classic books and people cannot come to terms with how to continue enabling people to buy this anime , because everyone is arguing over how to! Instead of just going all the way and allow people to finish whatever it is they want to do in terms of art projects such as this everything is put to delays , and even the directors and producers are unsure of what is going to be the outcome with this project.
And Ursula Guin continues to be unhappy with the two remakes of Tales from Earthsea. Well to begin with , she is the creator of a fantasy world titled simply Earthsea , and her excellent and major important books are portions of a glimpse into that Earthsea world , and I happen to have a copy of one of the original paperbacks. After all the copyright violation acts everyone got scared to death about expressing their uniqueness through spontaneity. I remember when in the early 1990's every Hollywood film maker would base a film he or she had produced on the work of another Hollywood film maker in order to ensure the survival of Hollywood.
The latest example with this insanity was how the producers of the Icelandic movie Astropia felt that Heroes didn't deserve to be better.
The argument over the Earthsea DVD issue is in part how similar or dissimilar the storyline is to the content of the Earthsea books. I do not know myself how faithful the DVD producers were to the book's original content , but I'll find out once I finish them and I am not disappointed with the glimpses of the parts of the movie I am currently viewing as I write. I am disappointed with insane obsession when it turns about people becoming afraid of sucess because they're not sure if they have 'based their idea on the work of somebody else'or even 'been influenced by somebody else'.
The Earthsea world is the world of the future , it's buildings blend in with nature and the king is a capable leader with excellent leadership skills unbound to the interests of any secret society. There is utopia and un - utopia in this world , and the utopia is only a small moment in time which you can choose on your own terms how long you want to last depending on how the movie appears to you by your definition of 'utopia'.
Dragons fly the skies and fight each other over inner conflights , and they are forced to resolve those issues by sharing the land in cooperation with the people and the kings and the native and non - native shamen , elders and others.
The societies in this film are based on the kind of society that the people of Saving Iceland and I think , Franscis Fukuyama envisioned. So to a certain extent this film is not a unique experiment in the design of an anthropological community which has evolved on it's own terms with it's own rules. There is enormous truth in the film , such as the notion of materialistic dragons attempting to shapeshift into humans to learn about the values of human life. The film has lots of impact on the world - view of anyone who views it , and it is a sad fact that the manufacturer could not come to terms with how to maintain the continuance with their product.
This statement does NOT mean that the product itself has been discontinued by the manufacturer , only that it is frozen in time due to fear of what's going to happen if it gets continued due to uncertainty about the future of the product. An uneccesary fear which could have been resolved through more cooperation and less arguing. What most of those who are behind the intense copyright laws do not realize or refuse to face , is the fact that the viewers of the films they produce when viewing them for free on the internet or whatever are trying the film before they buy it's DVD version.
It's only a matter of time before the storm settles down and people realize that just because Hollywood may go does not have to mean it has anything got to do with those kinds of issues , or with continuance of products or finding people who can keep the continuance of an important DVD movie going through some kind of financial aid.",1240185600,,5421,4.514750762970499
2798852,4,B000OPPTN4,"The movie is lovely, though all the menus are in Chinese and were thusly impossible to navigate. I'm also a little baffled by the full length pencils version being touted as an extra.

2798853,5,B000OPPTN4,"I guess that Hayao Miyazaki set the bar so high, it is hard to imagine anything approaching his standards. Yet this is the film Studio Ghibli had to make - elements of Earthsea have permeated almost all Miyazaki Senior's work. So, in some ways, Tales From Earthsea fundamental to an understanding of all the Miyazaki films.

So what is this one like? Well, I have watched it three times in two days and it succeeded in bring tears to my eyes on each occasion. It is a beautiful film and it is full of both humanity and wonder. The characters are complex and multi-layered. The animation is beautiful, if ever so slightly different from that of Hayao Miyazaki. If this is a debut from Goro Miyazaki, then I think he will be awesome by the time he gets to his third or fourth film.

The orchestral soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful and the equal of any of the Studio Ghibli films. The soundtrack also features a heartbreakingly beautiful song, sung by the young actress who voices the role of Therru. The soundtack is worth buying as well as the DVD.

So, Tales From Earthsea may be slightly less than the standard of the usual Hayao Miyazaki film, but it absolutely flaws any animated film from Hollywood in recent years. I predict a very bright future for Goro Miyazaki.

Four stars for the film and an extra star for Aoi Teshima very touching and beautiful song.",1191888000,7,1364,4.577868852459017
2798854,3,B000OPPTN4,"Tales from Earthsea is done by Goro Miyazaki, the son of well known animator, Hayao Miyazaki. For the most part, it seems like Goro is intent to follow in dads footsteps in creating animation almost identical to his fathers...which, is astoundingly beautiful.

While the animation is topnotch the story starts to fall a bit flat halfway through and leaves the audience with quite a few questions that just don't seem to add up.

The story follows Aarren, a young but confused Prince who has fits of rage. One of his ""fits"" causes him to kill his father for no apparent reason and flee his home. He then meets up with a wizard who is searching for the reason why the world is ""out of balance"" and why bad things seem to be happening everywhere. The wizard however suspects he knows the reason why...an arch nemisis wizard who is intent on living forever. Somehow the fate of Aaren, the wizard and a troubled young girl are all tied together in trying to defeat evil.

Earthsea is fun to watch but in the end you will probably scratch your head wondering why the story ended as it did and just what sort of backstory your missing.

I'd give this movie 5 stars for the animation but that alone won't gloss over the plot holes.",1185062400,,1223,4.495495495495495
2798855,3,B000OPPTN4,"Following in the footsteps of Howl's Moving Castle, Studio Ghibli has once again turned to the works of other literary writers as inspiration for yet another animated feature. This time around, they have gone to the world of Ursula K. Le Guin's Tales from Earthsea series, loosely adapted from the third and fourth installments of the Earthsea saga (The Farthest Shore and Tehanu, respectively). What is interesting is that the movie was helmed by Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki, and this is his directorial debut. Although far from great, this movie is still a good indication of hopefully even better works in the future from this director. Better known by the title Gedo Senki, the story revolves around a wise old wizard, a young prince with an accompanying dark side, and an evil witch who plans to use him for her own reasons.

The first thing you will notice upon watching is definitely the visuals. The details are very graphically striking and vivid. You will see everything from great-looking towns and markets to dank dungeons and castles to open seas and grassy meadows. There are quite a few beautiful overview and panning shots very reminiscent and much inspired by previous Ghibli films that fans will feel right at home. The only problem is with the washed out appearance and drab simplicity of the character designs, which clash and don't blend very well with the backgrounds and environments. This is vaguely awkward considering the amount of care that was put into the animation of the last few Ghibli features. But if there is one thing to complement this movie for, it would be the music. This is one of those rare cases in which the soundtrack, done by the legendary Tamiya Terashima, surpasses the movie itself. It may very well be of the one best yet heard in an animated movie this decade.

Unfortunately, not as many good things could be said for the actual story. There were times when the film's plot felt as though it was not developing properly enough as it progressed, nor was it unfolding very clearly to get a good idea of how to react to the events. The characters would find themselves in situations or engaging in pieces of dialogue that don't quite hold your interest very well either. Some scenes were too prolonged than what they should be while others end too quickly or abruptly without much reason or thought behind why. You want to be concerned about what is happening or what is going to happen next, but the movie often doesn't allow you to do so. This annoyingly erratic and unbalanced method of story-telling, along with the rather disappointing animation scheme, gives the entire movie a rushed and incomplete feeling that greatly hampers the enjoyable factor. Luckily, the story isn't so convoluted which makes it not too difficult to follow along. Also, there were a couple unforgettable moments in the film that make it worth seeing, including one scene which literally had me crying.

So do I recommend this film? I suppose it depends. I would probably break down the target audiences into three broad categories: those who are Studio Ghibli fans, those who are fans of the Earthsea series, and those who are not exactly familiar with either one but would just want to watch something worthwhile. In any case, that would still be a lot of viewers nonetheless. Being able to enjoy it stands on where exactly your expectations lie. It could disappoint Earthsea fans since this is only loosely based off the books. For me, this is the kind of film you would want to watch after seeing a streak of very good films and you don't really want something overly spectacular for a change. I can only hope that this review, despite the negative feedback I have given, will further spark and enhance your interest in seeing this movie so you can make up your own mind, instead of discouraging you to not see it at all. And hey, who knows. You may end up liking Tales from Earthsea more than I did. So just go ahead and see it!",1184889600,41,3971,4.735549132947977

2798869,5,B000OPPTN4,"Great movie.  I haven't read the books, so am not judging the movie against them, but I must say I enjoyed it.  An entertaining fantasy movie, but as it says in the product description and right on the back of the DVD box, it is rated PG, and not for young children due to some scenes that may be frightening to them.  There is also more violence than your 'typical' Studio Ghibli film, though probably less than in Princess Mononoke.  Neither of which bothered me in the least, but some reviewers seemed upset by that.

I personally only watch the Japanese language with English subtitled versions of Studio Ghibli films, as for me the voice actors capture the emotions and personalities of the characters far better than the English dubs.  Even though this particular movie is set in and features European characters.

As always, the Studio Ghibli artwork and animation are incredible, and somehow makes the characters seem more alive to me than the more famous, purely CGI animated movies out of Hollywood.",1501113600,,1009,4.797687861271676

2798872,2,B000OPPTN4,"I don't know about the DVD; I saw it on cable.
This is actually a terrible movie, deserves one star on its merits: utterly mixed up plot that makes no sense, tedious pace, pretty bad dialog, mediocre voice acting at best, editing-- was there any?  Godsawful script.  Lots of things get resolved and I don't understand how.

Some people gave it two stars because of its visual beauty.  (However, the animation is uneven-- sometimes pretty good, I think, although I know nothing about anime or Miyazaki or Ghibli, and I'm not a connoisseur of animation); sometimes partial animation, reminds me of the Flinstones, though of course not that bad.  Maybe that's the convention in anime, I wouldn't know.  The backdrops are pretty, and I really like the animals-- the people, not so much.

I'm giving it two stars because at least it tries to be faithful to the intent of the Earthsea novels, though it fails abysmally.
There was an earlier abomination, I mean adaptation, of some elements of the Earthsea novels called the Legend of Earthsea, a SyFy miniseries, which was just unbelievably bad and bore no real relation to the novels, just borrowed the name and a few names of characters (and got them backwards, making Ged's true name Sparrowhawk!!!!!! and Ged his usename!!!)  Also notable for Danny Glover, utterly miscast as Ged.

This takes plot elements from at least four of the Earthsea novels, plus some utterly extraneous elements, mixes them all up in a blender, leaves a lot of things incomplete or unexplained or both, but there is  a serious attempt to present Le Guin's concept of the Balance and her ideas about magic.  Doesn't work at all; people who haven't read the original trilogy, plus at least Tehanu, have no idea what's going on, and those of us who have can see what they're trying to do, but they miss by a mile.  But I have to give them credit for trying.  Very ambitious, shows some respect for the original material.
Still, it's a boring, frustrating mess, not really worth watching.  It's not as bad as the Peter Jackson Hobbit movies, let alone the miniseries, but it's pretty bad.",1495929600,,2108,4.7554945054945055

The animation, especially landscapes, are for the most part Studio Ghibli perfect, but the whole movie slides downhill badly towards the end. Contracted from 3 separate books of the series, and oddly twisted to fit a new story line, I was very disappointed with the plot - and quite disgusted with the extremely lengthy, gory, overdone transformation of the witch character seeking eternal life. Was that needed? I felt it was quite out of character with the usually tasteful, even if at times dark or sad developments in Studio Ghibli's ""fantasy"" movies.

Lately I decided to have a collection of Miyazaki's work and bought it again to give it another chance. I liked it better the second time. Then I watched the lengthy and very interesting feature on how the music had been written. I was fascinated by the different instruments from ancient to modern and the gifted musicians that were explored in order to get the sound that the composer was looking for. So I watched the movie again. And while I am still not satisfied with this story - for one thing you do not get the closure that Miyazaki senior would give in the credits at the end - I have been humming the music all day.

The English title, Tales From Earthsea, is also misleading, as it is the same title as the fifth book of the Earthsea series (which has six books so far), but draws its characters more from the third and fourth (and worst) books of the series (ironically, the book Tales From Earthsea only includes Ged as a minor character in a short part of one of its five short stories). I suspect the English title was given as a matter of convenience, while the selection of the Japanese title is a complete mystery (not to mention the fact that Ged goes by his nickname of Sparrowhawk throughout most of the movie).

I read reviews of this that said it was awful, but given my interest in the book series (and healthy respect for Ghibli Studios), I needed to watch this film to satisfy my curiosity. Sadly, it really is a terrible film. Nothing makes sense plot-wise, the characters are uninteresting, and the screenplay has almost completely reinvented the source material. Events from Ged's life are transferred to Arren's, whose father is introduced haphazardly for the film. The relative age of the characters is all over the place, and Therru is about 10 years older for the movie than she was in the books, and has been turned into a moody little creep. The depiction of the wizard Cob is interesting, although also a bit hackneyed by regular Japanese anime standards.

The opening scenes in the court of Enlad, with talk about trade disruptions in the kingdom and a mysterious blight sweeping the crops and peoples, has all the charm of the opening of The Phantom Menace. So many things in the plot are confusing, like why suddenly wolves are attacking Arren, why Sparrowhawk even takes the kid on as a travelling companion in the first place, or why Lord Cob is in such desperate need of slaves (I'm sure there's no reason for any of this, other than to drive action scenes that build to some sort of a conclusion). Of course, the ending is pretty exciting, and the downfall of Cob is terrifying to watch; the theme about a door between life and death is also a grand one, which Le Guin somehow explores in a few of her books, most notable The Farthest Shore.

The quality of the animation is also pretty clunky, and at times I felt like I was watching an animated TV show from the 1980s or so. Not really what you'd expect from Studio Ghibli.",1422230400,4,2564,4.557483731019523

2798967,3,B000OPPTN4,"In one scene from this movie, Prince Arren is captured by slave-traders and put in a wagon with other youths his age, all of whom coincidentally share the same build and physique. During this scene, my mother quipped, ""Only one-size boys in the wagon!"" I believe her funny observation accurately sums up this movie's problems: a tendency on the part of the filmmakers to forego originality and rely upon tired anime conventions to carry the garbled plot. Allow me to explain.

I should first say that I didn't hate this movie. I am a huge fan of Studio Ghibli films, fantasy books, and Ursula K. Le Guin. The Earthsea Cycle is as seminal a work of fantasy literature as Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS or C.S. Lewis' CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. A Studio Ghibli adaptation of Le Guin's books should have been right up my alley. These novels have aged extremely well and are still some of the most unique pieces of fantasy writing on the shelves. A shame, then, that Goro Miyazaki and his team decided to mash up the plots of three books into a generic fantasy storyline while piling a heap of anime cliches on top of it all.

What cliches, you ask? Let's tally them up. Other reviewers have already detailed the plot, so I'll launch straight into the critique. Some spoilers are included.

1. Character design. Anime frequently utilizes a scale-of-hierarchy approach to convey characters' ages. Young characters are often shorter and slimmer than adults. Mature adults are mostly stout and tower over young people, regardless of the fact that a fine-boned youth will still be a fine-boned man at age 40 even if he's gained weight.

Arren is animated as a short, slender boy because he's only 17. That's acceptable, but as I already mentioned, every other boy his age looks exactly the same. In real life, some of the boys in that slave wagon would have been very tall, rawboned, heavyset, etc. And all the ""shady"" characters are drawn with exaggerated grotesqueness. Just look at those blunt Simian faces, big bulging eyes, bovine teeth and mouths that stretch the width of their entire face. And wouldn't you know it? The evil wizard Cob is one of those freakishly tall, rail-thin, androgynous anime villains with long, sleek hair. Therru sports the kind of silly uneven haircut you'll only see in anime. You might argue that physical appearance is a minor quibble, but this adherence to familiar designs is still a lazy way to individualize characters. Which brings me to....

2. Voice acting. This goes hand-in-hand with the appearance trait. I am referring specifically to the Japanese cast. Young characters always have light voices, older characters must have deep voices. See Arren and the archmage Sparrowhawk. Fortunately for us, Therru is a ""damaged girl,"" and so by the rules of anime she can speak with a normal voice to match her serious personality, rather than the annoying helium voice a young girl would usually have. The shady characters? Hear them whine and wheedle, sneer and cackle as they peddle their drugs on the streets of Hort Town and harass little girls. Cob's second-in-command Hare is the most annoying, while Cob's (non-canonical) androgyny is heightened by a whispering female actress. I understand that a voice actor can convey an animated character's personality, but the voice acting here is pretty typical of the genre.

3. Personality. Arren is either emo or angry for the entire duration of the movie, and for no explainable reason. We have no idea why he was split in two to begin with or why he killed his father. Therru is an angry girl who hates Arren for no reason. Both of them are much changed from their characters in the books, but again the worst offender is Hare. In the book, he was a secondary character. In this movie, he's Cob's leering henchman just because the rules of anime dictate that the villain must have an extremely annoying lackey. Cue obligatory near-rape scene.

4. Everything is depicted symbolically rather than realistically. There is a scene for example where Arren encounters drug addicts in an alleyway, while Sparrowhawk describes in detail how the drug ruins the body, and Arren is promptly sick. Aside from a few smudges on the limbs of the addicts, we don't see the drug's effects on these people. They look too clean. More importantly, both Sparrowhawk and Therru have badly scarred faces, but unless you've read the books, you might not see it in their design. Sparrowhawk in the movie has a white blemish one one cheek rather than claw marks, while half of Therru's face is merely more pink. In the books, Therru was burned and severely disfigured. Anime is all about symbolism, but this approach detracts from Earthsea's realism. Keeping everything pretty is just lazy animation that doesn't resonate strongly with the viewer, because it looks too cartoony and tame.

4. Finally, let's address the race issue. Earthsea's people are mostly people of color, a deliberate choice Ursula K. Le Guin made to include minority groups in a literature dominated by white characters. In this movie, only Tenar should be white, yet all of the characters are. Le Guin was not happy, but she mentioned on her website that anime conventions frequently use skin color as symbolism, that Japanese viewers will see these characters as dark, and she qualifies that she doesn't know enough about race in Japan. She's being too diplomatic. I don't care how you spin it, a medium that only uses dark skin colors to reflect ""darkness"" in a character's personality is racist. Sparrowhawk may or may not look dark-skinned to Japanese viewers; he doesn't look dark to the naked eye. He's a white man with a tan. What exactly was the problem with painting all these people brown, except that most characters you see in anime are very pale? To all of Ursula's fans who sat through the sci-fi channel's whitewashed LEGEND OF EARTHSEA, this is disappointing.

This movie had potential. There are good things about it. The animation is beautiful, the music is haunting, and Le Guin's deep themes are mostly quoted verbatim from THE FARTHEST SHORE. However, her messages aren't presented in a coherent way, and neither is the story. Bits and pieces of the plot from three books are mashed together with very little consistency and no context. The movie relies too much on violence to carry the plot. And wouldn't you know it? Even though they live on Earthsea, the characters are mostly land-bound for the duration of the movie.

In the end, TALES FROM EARTHSEA committed the same sins as the sci-fi channel: whitewashing the cast, jumbling the story, and playing it safe with tired genre conventions to give the audience something they'd expect to see rather than the unique world depicted in Le Guin's books. ""One-size"" will not fit every movie.",1384128000,2,6788,4.874350086655113

2798969,5,B000OPPTN4,"Upon discovering Studio Ghibli through a friend a year ago, I began searching for any of its titles that looked interesting. I had already seen ""Spirited Away"", ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""Laputa: Castle in the Sky"", and ""Princess Mononoke"" when I stumbled upon a trailer for the film ""Tales From Earthsea"". The trailer, in spite of - or perhaps because of - being short and unspecific, made me want to watch the film as soon as I could get a hold of it so I ordered it and waited what seemed like an age for it to come, I was in such suspense. Still being rather unfamiliar with the studio, and seeing the name Miyazaki on the cover, I thought, ""Oh, it's going to be another wonderful Hayao Miyazaki film!"" So on a night when I was home alone I put it in my DVD player and sat back and let it roll.

Despite my limited experience with Miyazaki films I immediately realized that it had a lot of differences from his other films, not only in animation style but also in mood. Joe Hisaishi did not compose the score, which could be part of the reason why the film feels different. It struck me as a strangely mysterious epic fantasy film that sounded faintly like Star Wars (I was delighted to find out later that the English audio track was mixed at Lucasfilm), and I stuck with it, being a fan of that particular genre. But unlike most heroic fantasy I was used to, the main character was not real heroic at all; in fact, he seemed in incessant fear of something or someone, was always running away from nonexistent noises, and kept revealing a dark side that twisted his face and defeated his enemies, even though he was using a sword that would not come out of its sheath. In short, there was an original undertone of fear and bewilderment.

It was quite a while before the real villain showed up, and I must say he is one of the creepiest villains I have ever seen, in animation or otherwise. I was a bit uneasy. What was Miyazaki doing? This wasn't anything like his other movies. I hoped it wasn't about to scare me to death. But despite one scene that has an exceptional creepiness, nothing that remotely qualifies as horror actually happens. In Hayao Miyazaki films I've noticed that the ""villains"" of the movies are rarely all bad, and in fact they generally learn from their mistakes at the end. Well, in ""Tales From Earthsea"", this is flipped: there is a real villain, but the main character is almost just as bad. Arren struggles with all the same things as the evil lord Cob, only on a less advanced level. Arren even commits murder, an act that haunts him throughout the rest of the movie, and rightly so.

It is not until about two-thirds through that everything finally starts to become clear. While the film wrestles a great deal with the issue of death, it struggles jointly and even more so with the issues of fear, dishonesty, and guilt: being afraid of yourself, running away from what you've done, lying to yourself about it, and being crushed into inaction by the weight of your guilt. Arren is not on a quest like most epic fantasy characters; he's a fugitive, willing to do anything to escape from his greatest fear and mortal enemy: himself. And when escape becomes impossible, why not just lie down and die? ""We're all going to die someday. So nothing we do here really matters."" He runs from the darkness within himself, only to discover that what he flees is the light that exposes his darkness and sets him free.

""Life is precious because we know we're going to die. Death isn't what you fear most, Arren. You're afraid to live. You're afraid to live the only life you have.""

All told, this film debut of one Goro Miyazaki, the great Hayao Miyazaki's son, is my favorite Studio Ghibli movie. No other film has touched me so much; near the end of my first time watching it, I realized I was crying. It's not for everyone. It does not hold the adventure, the suspense, or even the heart-warming qualities of Hayao Miyazaki films, and the PG-13 rating is, I suppose, justly given, as there is some violence and a couple of scary moments. But it's a bold, honest story of a tormented boy, journeying through guilt, terror, darkness, and despair, until he finally reaches peace.",1382227200,8,4201,4.522368421052631

The formers should remember that this is Goro's first directing-work, ""Spirited Away"" was Miyazaki's eight movie, and before Cagliostro he had already worked for TV - of course, experience always helps.
The latters should know that this is a mix of many canon novels and short stories, with many characters made up from at least two Le Guin characters (e.g.: movie-Cob is a mix of novel-Cob, ""Tehanu""'s Aspen and ""Dragonfly""'s Thorion).It is somehow kind of an Earthsea encyclopaedic film and not too bad; of course there are many plot deviations, but the work still keeps the original novels' feeling, much more than, say, Peter Jackson's ""Tolkien according to Jackson"" movies.
Ged is voiced by Timothy Dalton and Cob by Willem Dafoe, not bad at all (though Dafoe's voice doesn't properly suit Cob's womanly looks).

After all, concepts brought up at the outset (the world's balance etc) are never touched on again, even in a cursory manner. Having not read the books, I could not comment one way or the other as to the film's faithfulness or lack thereof. But it only gets worse.

Unanswered questions are sprinkled across the film like rice at a wedding. Unfortunately, there are no pigeons around to clean up this mess. Almost nothing about the world's history is explained, leaving newcomers entirely in the dark. This could be forgiven if the film was thought-provoking and/or action-packed enough to compensate. Sadly, this is far from the case. The villain, Lord Cob, isn't even one-dimensional. He is so boring and his actions so predictable as to be insulting to primary school children. The overarching ""theme"" of the movie is even worse. It makes me think that Ghibli did no work on the script beyond inserting a few words in an automated storyline generator and going with the first result.

2798986,2,B000OPPTN4,"What a disjointed mess of a film this is. Studio Ghibli has made a handful of sub par films in the past, nothing bad just a few films that don't quite live up to their incredibly high standards. For a studio with such an outstanding track record its hard for me to fathom how this film was made. Did they think that just because they got the son of Hayao Miyazaki to direct it that it would turn out to be gold? The story is all over place, it takes forever to get going, and to top it off its main character is the most pathetic, worthless, and fragile hero I've ever seen in a Ghibli movie. Hell, Kiki was more useful then this sorry excuse for a prince. A hallmark of Miyazaki films are the strong hero's and heroins within them. What would Princess Mononoke be without San and Ashitaka? How about Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind without Nausicaa and Asbel? Or Sheeta and Patzu from Castle in the Sky? See a pattern? Though young all of these characters are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves, and not a one of them is in a constant need of saving. Arren, the main character of this movie, is more useless then Shinji from Evangelion. He needs saving more then Princess Peach. I think at some point every other good character get's their chance to save his sorry butt after he puts himself in a terrible situation entirely of his own doing. Normally such a trait would be redeemed by saving the day at the end, but he doesn't even get to do that, as again he needs to be saved AGAIN. He does NOTHING of consequence the entire movie.

The story starts out with a very impressive sweeping scene of a ship at sea floundering in a storm as their captain tries desperately to keep it afloat. On board is a wizard who's job it is to calm the seas, but for some reason never really explained he can't remember the words to the right spell. Whether this is because the man is just an idiot, or the captain bought a bargain price wizard, we don't know. But then suddenly a pair of dragons swoop down from the sky and scare the living daylights out of the crew. Cut to the King of this land, as he meets with a counsel of his closest advisers and wise men to consult with them over the dire situation of the country. A plague is spreading, killing sheep and young children, a plague we will never see and that plays no role whatsoever in the movie. Dragons have reentered the world and threaten the future of Earthsea as we know it! Dragons who, again, will not show up again (well, mostly) and play almost no role in the movie. In fact, the entire first part of the film is a waste and seems more a way to please fans of the books instead of for the sake of good story telling. The entire opening could be cut , and should have been, and the movie would haven stronger for it. Really, what good is it? It gives us numerous false conflicts that will play no role in the story, introduces us to characters that won't show up again, ever, and gives to us one of the most half hearted, uninspired, idiotic introductions to a main I've ever seen.

Our hero, Princes Arren, who has been given absolutely no introduction or back story at this point, just runs up to his father, stabs him in the chest, steals his sword, and runs away. All in about a fifteen second scene. No set up, no reason (come to think of it, why he does this is NEVER explained), no build up in tension, nothing. He just runs up, stabs his dad, and steals his sword, supposedly while sticking his tong out and teasing ""nanananana"" while he ran. Our hero everybody.

I've never read the books, but I've heard a lot of good things about them. It seems at times like Miyazaki tried too hard to throw in the mythology of the world where it didn't belong, and skimmed over more important aspects of it that might have made for a more interesting movie. For instance, slavery is a big part of this world, and directly effects most of the main characters, yet after the first act it plays little to no role in the rest of the story. Why? That would have been WAY better then what they ended up doing. Adaptions can be tricky beasts if you don't have the budget or running time to tell the full story (ala Lord of the Rings) but I never felt a sense of wonder or curiosity about the world or setting, which is absolutely vital when adapting a fantasy series. The mythology of the world, and the rules under which it operates (if indeed there are any at all) are left entirely unexplained which left me confused and dumbfounded at many key moments. Magic, dragons, wizardry, all this is fine so long as they are given rules to follow. Without such rules they are reduced to simply deus ex machina which detract from the world and the story rather then enhance them. To add to this, the idea of The Balance, which apparently holds the world together ala ""The One Power"" in The Wheel of Time series, is never fleshed out or explained. The characters are constantly talking about how The Balance is being threatened, and must be restored, but we are never given privy to what exactly will happen if it ISN'T restored. This would be fine (though not desired) if the story and characters were strong, but since they are as weak as they are we are left with little to no tension throughout. I didn't care about the characters, the plot took FOREVER to get anywhere, and the stakes were never adequately explained. So tell me, what was there for me to get invested in?

Now to this movies defense it isn't all bad. There is a lot to like  though not nearly enough to make up for the flaws. The designs and animation were amazing, bringing back memories of Nausicaa and Princes Mononoke. These films look a lot alike; characters wear similar clothing, the settings are very similar, and the character designs share the same charm and contrast. I absolutely loved this aspect of the film. In addition what few fantasy settings we are shown, such as the town of Hort, are beautifully rendered and imagined. If the entire movie were set there, I might have liked it a lot better. Unfortunately its in only a short portion of the film as the main characters are whisked away to... a farm. Yup, a farm. They had this big huge amazing city right there, and they decide to spend most of the movies time on a farm. AH!

Some of the supporting characters are also pretty good, though non of them to me ever felt like fully realized three dimensional characters. They play their respective roles pretty well, from wise old wizard, to whimsical villain, to caring mother type and emotionally troubled girl. Again though they hardly ever step out of these roles to become real people. Hell even Arren is stuck in one dimensional land, and he's the hero!

Overall Tales from Earthsea is a staggering disappointment. It isn't without its merits, as I've stated above, but no amount of interesting settings or wonderful animation can make up for weak characters and a weak story. Sorry to say, Ghibli has finally made a bad movie.

My main objection with this lethargic mess concerns the dead slow pace at which the barely coherent plot unraveled.  With only bits and fits of sporadic action, I found the story less then compelling.  It's completely devoid of wonder, and, oddly enough, magic.  I also found some of the voice-work questionable.  A long musical interlude didn't help matters either.  It's a pity Le Guin can't sue.  But!

2798995,3,B000OPPTN4,"To start with - I love Studio Ghibli. I have now watched all but two of their films (you can click on my name and see the reviews). I have never given a Studio Ghibli film anything less than four stars. Until now.  But this films lacks the typical Studio Ghibli magic, which is ironic considering the subject matter. The film itself is beautiful like all SG films. The music is as great as always, though not as good as the music in Nausicaa or My Neighbor Totoro. It's the story that is the problem.

Without giving too much away, balance has been lost in Earthsea.  Arren, son of the king, kills his own father and then flees. Suddenly the scene shifts and Arren is rescued by the wizard, Sparrowhawk. The story meanders until the inevitable conclusion between Arren and the dark wizard, Cob.

At no point does one ever really identify with the characters. I've been moved by and liked every other Studio Ghibli film. I know that no studio is perfect. Pixar had Cars 2 after all. But until this film, Studio Ghibli was perfect. Also, if you have read the LeGuin books, then this film will be a bit shocking. Happily I read them so long ago that that didn't really bother me. But the disjointed story and the lack of good characterization was a big problem. Hayao Miyazaki was right to think his son was not yet ready. The film shows it.

Especially when it comes to protecting Teru. For the witch Kumo this is a perfect opportunity. She can use the Arren's fear against the very one who would help him, Ged.

2798997,4,B000OPPTN4,"I have heard many things about the troubles this film faced; having Goro Miyazaki (Hayao Miyazaki's) inexperienced son directing the film, how it deviates from the source material, how the film is more violent than standard Ghibli fare. While all are valid concerns, I am here to inform you that, as far as the film itself is concerned, you have nothing to worry about with Ghibli's Earthsea. One of my top three Ghibli films (only surpassed by 'My Neighbor Totoro' and 'Grave of the Fireflies'), Earthsea may not follow the novels of which the story is based, but does that make for a bad film? In my opinion, absolutely not.
From the first open shots, the animation is amazingly fluid, and the fact that the storyline is more mature instantly make this film worthy of an animation fan's attention. This movie has it all; romance, action, horror, mysticism, magic. Above all, it tells a tale that will keep you riveted from the opening title screen, to the end credits. I was literally biting my nails up until the conclusion, and I am happy I invested my time into such a superlative movie experience. Don't let the detractors, or those that cannot understand artistic license, keep you from enjoy this film; if you like dragons and magic, coming of age films, a little horror mixed with action, and animation that is the pinnacle of what the studio can produce, 'Earthsea' is a testament to how someone can take a story and make it their own. Sure, it may alienate fans of both the Earthsea novels and Ghibli, but for those of us that can enjoy a film based on its own merits, this is an excellent example of a film that may not be a direct translation of media, but produces an end product that stands on its own as a beautiful piece of animated cinema.

2798998,4,B000OPPTN4,"I recently became a big fan of the Earthsea novels, and as I was already an anime nerd, I was really excited to see Tales of Earthsea.  Since it was mentioned in other reviews that the film was based mostly off of the third and fourth books in the series, I made sure I finished them both before I watched the film.  It does pick and choose its way through the Earthsea books, but overall I felt that it was largely true to the spirit of the series.  There are, of course, some unanswered questions and some insinuations that are never fleshed out, but then again, there are buckets of such things in the books as well.

As ever with Studio Ghibli, the art and dialogue were beautiful.  I do wish that Therru had been given a more significant disfiguration - that's a big part of her character, as is the fact that she seldom speaks or interacts with strangers much at all.  The film had a great storyline that worked with the novels but still has some distinctions of its own.

2798999,5,B000OPPTN4,"As a fan of both Le Guin's saga and of Ghibli's movies,I loved this film. I realize that this movie went pretty far off the trail of Le Guin's stories, but I am not one to dislike a movie because of how it differs from the book. I personally was okay with Goro's adaption.

Essencially, the movie is based not of the book Tales of Earthsea, but actually the 3rd book the the Earthsea Cycle, The Farthest Shore. However, it pretty much takes parts and ideas from each book. For example, Arren's shadow is sort of the plot of A Wizard of Earthsea, except in that book it is Ged's shadow (Sparrowhawk). Also, Tehanu is the protagonist of book four.

One thing that did bother me about the film was the lack of ""sea"" for an earthsea movie. After all, Ged's boat lookfar is practically it's own character in the books. I think there should have been a lot more sea travel in the movie...but that's no big deal.

2799006,3,B000OPPTN4,"Even a prolific animation studio like Ghibli can turn out a lesser effort.  Hiroyuki Morita's THE CAT RETURNS was my personal least favorite Ghibli movie, but that film, simplistic and shallow as it was, is a masterpiece (and even then it falls short of the studio's superior efforts) compared to 2006's TALES FROM EARTHSEA, arguably the first from the studio to split audiences and critics alike.

Ironically enough, the controversy actually began prior to the film's release.  It has been stated that Hayao Miyazaki had expressed interest in directing a film based on Ursula K. LeGuin's famous fantasy novels, but the author, displeased with previous attempts, declined... until the success of Miyazaki's HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE (arguably one of the director's least excellent but still technically brilliant efforts).  However, it was ultimately decided that the film would be handled by Miyazaki's own son, Goro, under the persuasion of producer Toshio Suzuki.  Miyazaki Senior was most displeased by these turn of events and it is said that his relationship with Goro became strained during the production period.  Perhaps Hayao had reason to fear that his son was not ready to tackle such an ambitious story; although TALES FROM EARTHSEA performed well financially, it was attacked by critics and even fans of the books.  In fact, Goro received the ""Worst Director"" Golden Raspberry Award for his first attempt.  All of this sounds like a cruel fate for the debut of the son of Japan's most respected animator, but even author Ursula K LeGuin has been disappointed with Goro's film.  In fact, TALES FROM EARTHSEA would not even see a release in the United States for another five years (more on account of the rights for ""Earthsea"" owned by SciFy at the time than its reputation).

The criticisms TALES FROM EARTHSEA has received are not without merit.  Anyone expecting another PRINCESS MONONOKE or CASTLE IN THE SKY will probably be disappointed for, while this film shows moments of brilliance and imagination, it falls short from the upper echelon of those films.  The problems lie in the storyline and characterizations.

Fans of LeGuin's books will probably be even more let down by this movie.  It is based heavily on the third book, ""The Farthest Shore"", but while most of the situations and characters survive the transition to the screen, Goro attempts to incorporate elements from the other books into the film.  But he does so in a way that only results in a tangled, confusing plot which not only feels rushed, but very incomplete and disorganized.  Sometimes events happen without explanation, and what little explanation we get is unsatisfying; maybe fans of the books will grasp what Goro's intentions are, but others will find themselves asking questions which unfortunately, never get answered.

The film gets off to a promising start with a stormy sequence in which a ship at sea witnesses a bloody clash between two dragons. It's exciting and intense, with a brief flash of gory violence that brings one to mind of the similarly graphic moments from PRINCESS MONONOKE.  TALES FROM EARTHSEA is still on that fine start when we see Arren, a teenage prince, inexplicably murder his father and escape into a desert.  He is rescued from wolves by Sparrowhawk, a kindly sorcerer with a scar on his face (for reasons that readers of the first book ""Wizard of Earthsea"" will recognize).  Sparrow's mission is to restore the balance that has been disrupted in the mystical land of Earthsea.

However, when these two adventurers cross paths with other characters such as a moody, introverted ""slave"" named Therru, a warmhearted farmer, and an evil wizard intent on gaining (predictably) eternal life, it becomes evident that Goro is trying to cram too much story worth of at least four books into a two hour film.  Aside from giving the characters little time to fully develop into fleshed out personalities, the film works in a very confusing and frustratingly murky subplot about a shadowy ""clone"" of Arren that shows up from time to time to torment the youth.  This is handled very awkwardly, with zero foreshadowing and the whole ""explanation"" behind the whole thing leaves questions instead of answers.  I was also very unclear about the climactic finale in which a girl transforms into a dragon; again, this is done with no explanation, that it only makes the audience baffled instead of thrilled.

Perhaps another big issue with the film is the pacing; as mentioned, the film's best sequence is the opening dragon fight, but such action moments are rather scanty throughout the rest of the movie, resulting in long, extensive stretches where nothing really happens.  For instance, at the halfway point, there is a long sequence in which the characters end up working on a farm.  Although intended to provide character development, this sequence only slows down the film and feels more like padding than anything else.  Brief moments such as Sparrowhawk and Arren talking about blistered hands after helping to plow the field feel strangely detached from the rest of the plot instead of anything else.  The real areas in which Goro shows strength as an animator are the dream sequences--and there are quite a few in this tale--in which the characters find themselves standing on sunlit landscapes with luscious colors one moment and nearly drowning in an ooze-infested lake the next.  These are actually far more interesting than much of the talkier scenes in the movie.

The lack of compelling characters is another major shortcoming with TALES FROM EARTHSEA.  Sparrowhawk, for instance, is nobility personified, and as such, is pretty boring.  Arren could have been a compelling troubled hero -- sort of a darker version of Ashi-taka from MONONOKE, but his character development comes across as rather hazy to be interesting.  The slave girl Therru, despite showing some backbone and the bitterness of San, isn't much more endearing than her co-stars.  Cob probably ranks as the most disappointing villain in any Ghibli film; oh sure, he's creepy and acts evil, but he doesn't have much of a personality, and lacks the charisma of, say, Muska from CASTLE IN THE SKY.  That he doesn't get much to do in the film is also a letdown.  Cob's slavetrader captain henchman, Hare, is much more effective as a badguy, and arguably is the only interesting character in the whole movie to display any personality.  He sneers, cackles, rasps threats, and is remorselessly ruthless.  It also helps that he is voiced by Cheech Marin in the Disney-produced English dub... who naturally gives the best performance in the whole film!

Speaking of the dub, this is probably one of the lesser Disney Ghibli dubs (THE WIND RISES coming off as the weakest), not because it is badly done--Disney has never produced an unlistenable dub as far as I'm concerned; their past dubs have all been fantastic, contrary to what others may say (yes, even the ones with extra music and dialogue).  Perhaps because of the murky nature of this movie, it is difficult for the dub to be as effective, despite the efforts of everyone involved.  Still, the performers and voice director Gary Rydstrom do their best:  As mentioned, Marin plays the part of Hare perfectly and effortlessly steals the show.  Timothy Dalton does an excellent job as Sparrowhawk, embuing him with wisdom, warmth, and subtlety.  Mariska Hargitay is also very good as the kindly farmer Tenar.  Matt Levin as Arren is a bit of a trickier issue:  he starts out somewhat flatly, but he gradually improves and gets especially good at the end.  On the other hand, Blaire Restaneo's Therru is the least effective of the voice cast; she shines brilliantly in singing the film's only song, a melancholy acapella solo originally rendered by Aoi Teshima and does all right in the tense scenes, but I wasn't so sold on the rest of her scenes.  Willem Dafoe's Cob works best in the climactic scenes where he rasps his way to the tower, but otherwise spends most of the time talking in a very soft, monotonous voice.  I don't know if it was supposed to convey darkness or not, but I didn't find it particularly effective (in fact, I was chuckling upon hearing him speak for the first time) and I'm still not sure if he was the right choice for the character.  Simply put, he's no match for Mark Hamill's Muska.  The rest of the voices are fine, although they're not nearly as memorable as in any of the other Ghibli dubs.  Even purists who insist on watching the film in Japanese will probably be disappointed, as the voice acting, or at least what I've heard, isn't much more effective than that of the dub.

Probably the most pleasing aspect of the film is its musical score contributed by Tamiya Terashima.  Ghibli films have excelled with gorgeous soundtracks, and this is no exception.  Using melancholy melodies and a full orchestra and chorus reminiscent of Hans Zimmer, Terashima provides a gorgeous and poundingly dramatic symphony that compliments the mood of the story perfectly.  (As mentioned, Therru's song midway through the film is a haunting highlight.)  And of course, the animation is as richly detailed and beautiful as any Ghibli film.

There are moments where TALES OF EARTHSEA does exude some haunting visuals, but all in all, it's probably the weakest of the Studio Ghibli movies so far.  Had Goro Miyazaki opted for a less daunting storyline, then maybe he wouldn't have received so much backlash for his debut feature.  As such, the obvious failings of EARTHSEA showed that he is not yet ready to fill his father's shoes.  But even with all that said, is this movie still worth watching?  If you're a Ghibli completist, then probably.  Others, though, may respond less enthusiastically.  TALES FROM EARTHSEA has its occasional moments of imagination and beauty, but don't expect another instant classic; on that level it falls short.",1331510400,,9903,4.966646452395391

2799013,2,B000OPPTN4,"Well, I've finally gotten around to watching ""Tales from Earthsea.""  I had high hopes for this, given that I was a huge fan of the original Earthsea trilogy when I was young. (I remember I was given the books for Christmas when I was about thirteen years old, and spent the remainder of my holiday that year totally engrossed in the story.) But man, what a bitter disappointment this film was.

On the plus side, it's a beautiful film to look at, with truly exquisite background paintings. And the musical score is quite nice as well. On the negative side, there's ---well, everything else!

Where to start... The pace is certainly slow enough; for a film that lasts nearly two hours, not a heck of a lot happens. None of the characters are particularly interesting. And Sparrowhawk, for being the most powerful mage in the land, seems particularly inept and lacking in any sort of charisma.

The real weakness of the film, however, is the plotting--or lack of it. None of it made a whole lot of sense. There's plenty of backstory that for the most part is totally unexplained. I mean---apparently these two wizards have a history together, but the few sentences that supposedly explain their story illuminate nothing. Also---what exactly was the mysterious doppelganger? Why did the prince act as he did at the beginning of the film. How did the wizard's quest for life throw the world out of balance? What the heck was up with the ""true"" nature of the girl?

Finally, despite the ""happy"" ending, if one follows the story to its logical conclusion, one of the main characters is going to end up very dead indeed shortly after the credits have finished rolling. Not exactly a cheerful thought.

Overall, this utterly failed to capture the feel of the world of Earthsea, and I'm going to have to say it was a complete misfire. What a huge disappointment. It would have been far, far better if the studio had attempted a straightforward two-hour adaptation of the first of the Earthsea books. Now, that could have been a jewel in the crown of the studio's film library. As it is---eh.

Animation buffs, and fans of the series of books, are likely to be curious about the film, and I'd say go ahead and give it a try if you wish, but keep your expectations low. As for me, I can't imagine I'd ever bother to re-watch this.

I'm afraid that this film, and the truly abysmal Sy-Fy miniseries adaptation, have pretty much killed off any chance of an additional film adaptation of the Earthsea books in the foreseeable future. A pity, because it's a rich world that still hasn't been explored properly on film. Ah well, we still have the first three Earthsea books to read----heck, I think I'll revisit them myself sometime this winter.",1324339200,14,2729,4.682672233820459

This brilliant film never stumbles as Asian translated films sometimes do.  You are involved from the start in the mystery of a world - and especially a boy - out of balance.  The boy is mentored by a wise Archmage, threatened by yet another, and all along finds his way out of the confusion of of a mystically played youth.

The world which is created mirrors our own, usually symbolically.  Sometimes though, as in the almost clear warning against drug use, the symbolism is almost dropped.  But love, betrayal, forgiveness, all set the stage for a boy to finally free himself, and a cursed world, with the help of his friends.

2799016,2,B000OPPTN4,"In the new chapter of Studio Ghibli it was time for Haiyo to let his son Goro Miyazaki try his hand at a new animated film. This time around we get `Tales From Earthsea' based on the famous fantasy novels. I was very much anticipating the chance to finally see this film, because while it came out in 2006 due to conflicts in America with their cable channel SyFi miniseries we had to wait a solid 4 years for Disney to finally have the rights and release the original animated film.

Much like the mess that this film endured to get to the United States the film is no different. I feel that this movie was a B version of `The Princess Mononoke'. The story and the characters had so much potential seeing the scale and the depth of the story that revolves around corruption and inner evil inside good people. However, the plot is underdeveloped there are parts of the movie that make very little sense that you get lost in the film and even worse a great voice cast that  really doesn't get the chance to do great things like the casts in Studio Ghiblis past. I am happy that they didn't change the voice cast that was used because this animated film did premiere in 2006 and The United Kingdom did give the film its own dubbed version featuring Timothy Dalton and Willam Dafoe.

Unfortunately, this film didn't grab me as I would have hoped, in fact I almost fell asleep watching it. I am also a little unhappy, because it seems that Studio Ghibli is not really going with original stories anymore. If you take a look at where Ghibli began and where they are now their films are starting to become a hit or miss.

The evil guy, whose gender wasn't entirely clear at first, was sufficiently evil and slimey, but turned out to be not much of a threat (except to stone structures). The story was confusing and seemed loosley cobbled together (this is true for a lot of Ghibli films). From what I can gather, the film was about the balance between life and death, light and darkness, yin and yang, or something like that. On the plus side, nice art splashes across the screen every other scene or so. The skyscapes are particularly good. Not the best Ghibli film.",1316563200,,950,4.56140350877193
2799021,5,B000OPPTN4,"Today I watched ""Tales from Earthsea"" by the son of Hayao Miyazaki. I understand that there is only a weak connection with the Le Guin novels (which I have not read). The reviews have been mixed. So, instead of buying the DVD, I streamed the movie over the Internet, from a service I subscribe to.
I thought the drawings were wonderful, and that the story was not terribly important. And fairy tales with wizards and dragons do not have to make a lot of sense. As usual in such stories, not everybody is what they seem to be.
What mattered most to me is the way everything has been drawn and animated, with great richness of detail and care, so the fact that the action is rather slow (something it has been criticized for) is actually a good thing, because one has more time to look at it and begin to see all that is there. It is really a movie for the eyes, and if one takes it as such, the resulting enjoyment can be real and profound. I think it is a very good Ghibli movie, with the old-fashioned look and feel of the best of them, and the familiar Miyazaki themes: strong, courageous and down-to-earth women, young love, young hero, wise older people, environmentalism.
It deals repeatedly with the hoary question of why is life worth living, with its deceptions and sorrows, if in the end we all must die? (""To be or not to be..."", ""Vanity of vanities..."" etc.) It offers, with a light touch, an answer that, while not original (how could it be), to me rings true.
I think that young Miyazaki shows great promise with this, I believe, his first full-feature film.
I am not sure if this is a good movie for children, who might like something faster-paced. But, at every age, not everyone is the same, and some might enjoy it very much, same as me.

2799023,3,B000OPPTN4,"Miyazaki Goro directed this enjoyable fantasy flick. It adapts Ursula K. LeGuin's famous Earthsea trilogy, using many of anime's visual idioms. I have enjoyed many of LeGuin's works, but I have to admit that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earthsea/dp/0553383043/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earthsea</a>&nbsp;series wasn't among them, and I read those books many years ago. Serious fans of the books might have trouble seeing how their beloved characters appear here. But, if you don't have those preconceptions, this really is a fair bit of fantasy. It offers magical adventures and excitement, but without much real violence. And, as a bonus, teens might empathize with Arren and Therru.

Although Goro is son of the incredible Miyazaki Hiyao (well famed for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirited-Away/dp/B00005JLEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirited Away</a>, among other things) and worked in his father's Studio Ghibli, this doesn't demonstrate his father's brilliance. In fairness, neither did some of his father's early work, either. Take the movie for what it is, though, without the context of the director's family or the books that loosely drove this story. It hardly breaks new ground, but there's plenty to enjoy anyway.

2799025,4,B000OPPTN4,"First of all, DVD-wise... the lack of special features, interviews and commentary is pretty disappointing. However, I found the subtitles to be accurate and of top quality, while the dubbing was probably the best Disney can realistically do with such a non-American tale. I found the dubbing almost as good as Spirited Away, although some of the acting was periodically lacking.

In terms of some less-than-kind reviews, negative Ghibli fans I believe are looking through a biased lens and over-reacting. Take off the goggles and compare this fine movie to any animation coming out of Hollywood today, and I challenge you to find anything even remotely close to Earthsea's creative mythology, and deep emotional and spiritual context, not to mention stunning animation. No, this is not a clear-cut, button-up-every-detail in a perfect little bow story, like a happy little Full House episode. This movie leaves you to ponder (like Laputa) exactly who the characters are and what their past entails. That is not a flaw in the plot, it is simply a different kind of story-telling. Anime fans and non-fans alike who may not necessarily follow Miyazaki may find themselves much less averse to these plot 'challenges'. Anime and manga is often ripe with such loose-ends, story prequels and unanswered questions. That's simply story-telling that's foreign, which American audiences are just not used to. It's no wonder to me that some of the greatest foreign films and stories ever told fly over the heads of the majority of today's thrill-seeking audiences looking for the latest eye-candy.

Don't pass up the opportunity to see this film. It's a deep psychological journey that probes the very real problems of deep depression and sadness, and attempts to illustrate that the high value of life is taken for granted through our incredible selfishness.",1313107200,4,1847,5.173913043478261

With that said, know that this movie makes absolutely no sense. This is just a ""pretty-ified"" movie by Studio Ghibli. The animation is top notch, the music is beautiful, but the story is completely lacking in any sort of continuity, there really isn't a story to tell here. The characters have no motivations for their actions, nowhere in the film do they explain why dragons are present, there is no back-story, nothing. Whatever executive approved this as a viable production probably didn't read the script because they should have halted production very early on for a re-write. It's presented as chance meetings between characters and no real explanation for why the characters should even consider interacting with each other. We can't cheer on Arren, the main character because of the opening scene which I won't reveal. The wizard, Sparrowhawk, is never given a chance to use his ""supreme"" powers at the most crucial moments when he should be saving the day.

2799027,5,B000OPPTN4,"`Tales from Earthsea' is one Ghibli movie that is notorious for its mixed reception, but after having watched it three times I believe this is a criminally misunderstood and underappreciated film. As flawed as it is, I deem it gorgeous with its art, animation, music (the songs especially), characters, as well as its low-key and deceptively simple story. For that I give it 5 stars to counterbalance the more negative reviews.

What needs to be realized is that this was directed by Goro Miyazaki, son of Hayao Miyazaki, who had no prior filmmaking experience. When taking that into consideration, he actually pulled off making a finer achievement than most first-timers, and full kudos to him for writing the two beautiful songs in the movie. But since this was his first film, it does come with its imperfections.

The one major flaw to it that may turn off most people is that it is incredibly slow-paced, almost to the point where it feels like it is testing the audience, and it drags especially during the climax. But I'm used to slow-paced Ghibli movies, because more often than not I can get absorbed enough into the story that I don't care, and `Tales from Earthsea' is no exception.

Another flaw is that many of the story elements come across a little vague, the characters talking about things like the `Dry Lands' and one of the characters turning into a dragon without any real explanation. Admittedly I never read the original books, but out of curiosity I read a quick synopsis of them on Wikipedia. Not only were the vague story elements made clearer to me, but it also helped me discover that Goro Miyazaki took selected story elements and characters from the different books, staying faithful to them while commingling them to create his own standalone tale.

As for the DVD itself, I do have some complaints. This movie is famous for its notoriety, and I can't help but feel it's reflected in Disney's awkward DVD release of this title. As far as special features go, we get a four-minute making-of featurette, and that's it. No 'Behind the Microphone,' no second disc with a storyboard version of the film or anything similar on prior domestically-released Ghibli DVD's. It's like the people of Disney watched it, realized it would be the least well-received Ghibli film, and didn't even try with its presentation here. Aside from the brief featurette, the DVD is laced with trailers for Disney movies, none of which belong on this disc. Considering `Tales from Earthsea' is a two-hour long slow-paced human drama with some morbid moments (I really wouldn't call it family-friendly), what in heck are trailers for `Cars 2' and `Tangled' doing on there? Reminds me of the `Veggie Tales' movie trailers I remember seeing on my `Ghostbusters' VHS.

So all in all, maybe `Tales from Earthsea' is technically the least best Ghibli movie, but for all its flaws it is still a good film and I would so far as call it my personal favorite Ghibli film. Do not go in expecting an action movie, for it is a straight-up character drama that's not about the action at all. And in the meanwhile, I look forward to Goro's next movie coming out in Japan--after all, to keep filmmaking is the only way he can get better!",1307404800,3,3224,4.770609318996415

2799029,3,B000OPPTN4,"Tales From Earthsea is a film that is loosely based on a combination of plots and characters from the first four books in Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series.  The film was directed by Goro Miyazaki, the son of Hayao Miyazaki.

The film begins with drought and pestilence spreading across the land, and the balance between man and dragons appearing to be weakening.  The main character is a boy named Arren, who is the prince of the land.  Arren murders his father, takes his sword, and runs away.  Arren ends up being rescued by a man called Sparrowhawk, who is the Archmage of the wizards.  While the two of them are in the city of Hortown, Arren ends up in the town alone.  He becomes scared, and is convinced someone is following him.  As he runs away from what he thinks is following him, he comes across a young girl named Therru, who is fleeing from a slave hunter.  Arren saves her.  This event ends up setting the rest of the story in motion.

Tales From Earthsea tried to take elements from four different books and put them together into one film.  I have not read this series myself yet, but from what I've heard, it's been said that the plot was a major departure from the story in the books.  When watching the film, I could definitely sense that the narrative felt a little choppy.  Since I have not read the books, I don't know if the narrative would have been stronger if the film had more closely followed the books.

Tales From Earthsea was released as a single DVD in the United States.  On the main menu, there are options for play all, scene selection, audio, previews, and bonus features.  For the film you can either watch the whole film, or you can select which scene or scenes you want to see.  In the set up menu, you can choose your language, choose your subtitles, and you can register the DVD.  For languages, there is English and Japanese.  For subtitles, there is English for the hearing impaired, English, and French.  The sneak peeks are for trailers for various properties being promoted by Disney.

The special features are split into two sections: ""Behind the Studio"" and ""Enter the Lands.""  For ""Behind the Studio,"" there is only a four minute documentary titled, ""Origins of Earthsea.""  Most of this feature is in Japanese with English subtitles, since the bulk of this piece is producer Toshio Suzuki talking about the project.  The only English dialogue comes from the scenes from the film (since they come from the English dub), and one interview piece with an animation historian.

In ""Enter the Lands,"" there is a menu that features elements from all of Studio Ghibli's films.  However, only the elements from Tales From Earthsea, My Neighbor Totoro, Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, and Castle in the Sky have elements that can be selected.  For Tales From Earthsea, there is a Studio Ghibli trivia challenge.  For the remaining areas, you see a short promo, followed by a menu with clickable elements (characters give you character bios, and other items react when chosen).  Ponyo has one page, while the others have 3-4 menu pages.

Admittedly, Tales From Earthsea is not one of Studio Ghibli's better films.  I think I was able to better enjoy than I might have, since I have no familiarity with the source material.  However, if you're a fan of the Earthsea books, my suspicion is that you probably wouldn't enjoy the film very much.  I would only recommend purchasing this DVD if you're a fan of Studio Ghilbli and you want to own every film released by the studio.

2799032,3,B000OPPTN4,"I've never read any of the Earthsea books, but I was really excited when I heard that Studio Ghibli was doing a midieval European fantasy film with dragons and magic spells and knights. (I mean, just look at the cover! That dude's talking to a dragon!) However, upon viewing this movie I found it to be pretty boring.

This isn't to say it's not enjoyable--I loved some of the characters and the world that they reside in, but there's just very little story and a whole lot of nothing going on. There's not much action, although Arren does get into a fight once or twice (he doesn't unsheathe his sword until the end, though). Furthermore, most of the scenes have this dreamlike quality to them where everyone speaks in gentle or solemn tones with little emotion (at least in the English dub); it's great voice acting, but it makes for some pretty monotonous dialogue.

The plot is okay, I suppose, but it lacks soul and flavor and by the end I found myself questioning what exactly was going on. The main character kills his father in the first few minutes, but for the rest of the film he doesn't do much but mope (and they never really explain why he did it). The villain is a weird androgynous man in a dark tower who is clearly evil because he tortures people and trades slaves, but is so dispassionate that I find it hard to dislike him--he has no character. The character I really liked was Ged the wizard. He was very wise and fatherly, but as I said before his voice got to be monotonous from time to time.

While Tales From Earthsea isn't a bad movie by any means, I'd have trouble recommending it to anyone--it's just too boring and the plot is too weak. Also, while the animation is good, it lacks the spectacular ""wow!"" scenes that we've come to expect from a Studio Ghibli film. The dragons are barely even in the movie, too. From what I understand, it doesn't follow any of the Earthsea books either, although the names of some of the characters are present. It did, however, get me interested in reading them and I just ordered the first book. I also watched the SyFy minisieries of Earthsea and boy was that fun!

So the final verdict is that you probably shouldn't buy it unless you're really trying to complete your Studio Ghibli collection. Try renting it first, I guess, but rent another movie at the same time so you won't end up wasting your whole evening. I mean, I'm actually considering selling my copy of this movie soon.",1303430400,3,2448,4.49438202247191
2799033,3,B000OPPTN4,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, but I neglected to review it when it was still fresh in my mind. And Tales from Earthsea is just mediocre enough that it slithers out of the memory, given half a chance.

It's not a bad movie, though it doesn't live up to any of its heritage -- it's from Studio Ghibli, being the first movie directed by Hayao Miyazaki's son Goro, and of course it's based on Ursula K. Le Guin's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/excellent-novels/dp/0739452711/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">excellent novels</a>&nbsp;-- and it doesn't either adapt the original stories well or make a new story of its own to tell. Instead, it mixes and matches elements from three or four of the books in ways that don't really fit together, but still stays with a linear plot so that the word ""tales"" in the title doesn't make sense.

It looks wonderful, in that usual Ghibli way, and Goro Miyazaki has learned the lesson of stillness from his father -- TALES FROM EARTHSEA has a camera that lingers in a way never seen in American animation, or much in any movies these days. But I found myself wishing that I had been watching it in Japanese rather than English, because the story I would have made up while watching it to explain all of the various elements would certainly have held together better, and been a better adaptation of Le Guin, than the actual movie that emerged.

There are probably at least three blogs dedicated entirely to anatomizing exactly what's wrong with this movie; go see them for further details. On the positive side, I will say that it's vastly better than the live-action Earthsea miniseries, and equally better than most of the animated movies I've seen over the last decade. It's not bad at all, as I said. But a Studio Ghibli movie of Le Guin should have been something magnificent, and it isn't, at all. It's a lumpy pudding made from random pieces of Le Guin's Earthsea, and a viewer has to be careful not to crack a tooth on it.",1302912000,,2012,4.792507204610951
2799034,4,B000OPPTN4,This is an enjoyable film. The story is not quite up to par with Hayao's work but the animation is beautiful and I am interested to see where Goro goes on his journey as a storyteller and animation artist.,1302825600,,205,4.282051282051282

Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro, directed this Ursula LeGuin piece very well, and I am duly impressed (despite what the Amazon site says about it) I suggest you leave all reviews aside and experience it for yourself.",1302566400,5,261,4.954545454545454
2799036,2,B000OPPTN4,"Be warned! I read the other reviews here, and  the one by R.M. Fisher 'Raye' ""You Think Your Life Belongs to You?"" is especially noteworthy and beautifully written.

I got the DVD anyway because I like Miyazaki the Elder's work very much indeed, and wanted to give this a try. I was so disturbed after watching it (although it is beautiful visually, as are all of Studio Ghibli's productions) that I pulled out my tattered old copies of the Earthsea Cycle and began to re-read them.

I am now in the middle of Tehanu (#4) and nowhere, NOWHERE in these books does Prince Arren kill his father and run away. He is sent to Roke BY his father to ask the counsel of the Mages, and is taken under the Archmage's wing in a journey that will make a man of the boy and a king of the prince.

The movie, in retrospect, feels all the more like someone made a jigsaw puzzle of a work of art and tossed the pieces in the air to see what it would look like when they fell down. The result is LeGuin's in name only. I hope at least they paid her generously.

 I am a lifelong fan of the profound writings of Ursula Le Guin, and would love to see a faithful adaptation of the Earthsea Cycle. This is not it. Helloooo? Peter Jackson? Are you available?",1302220800,3,1235,4.211864406779661
2799037,3,B000OPPTN4,"I consider myself a fan of Studio Ghibli's works.  In fact, I've seen almost every film that Studio Ghibli has created.  I've enjoyed most of them (with a few exceptions), but sadly, I feel like ""Tales from Earthsea"" is not one of their better releases.  I understand that this was the first film to be directed by Goro Miyazaki, Hayao's Miyazaki's son, and that is it also something of a pet project that Miyazaki Sr. had been wanting to do for years.  I've also heard that Miyazaki Sr. was not too pleased with the work done on this film by his son.  I was already aware of the negative reviews this film had garnered before I had a chance to rent it, but I was prepared to make up my own mind about it anyway.  I should also mention that although I have read the Earthsea series, it was many years ago and my memory is foggy at best, so I won't be commenting much on the faithfulness to the books, other than to say that I don't think this film follows any of the books too well...

Well, the closest comparison that one could make between this film and another Studio Ghibli film would have to be Howl's Moving Castle since they are both adaptations of a book.  From what I understand, neither one of those films actually follows their respective books too closely at all.  The difference here is that Howl's Moving Castle is a really good film on its own merits, but Tales from Earthsea feels slow and full of plot holes.  Some people might be quick to complain that ""Howl"" has plot holes too, but honestly, that film makes perfect sense if given some thought, whereas ""Tales"" just feels like plot points are missing.  For example, we are told that the world's magical balance is out of whack, but we are never really told what's causing this.  The wizard Sparrowhawk tells us ominously that there is only one being capable of doing this, but the only villain they confront later is the evil wizard Cob.  Is he the cause?  Sure he's an evil powerful wizard, but he doesn't really seem strong enough to put the entire world out of balance - I mean, he's not some centuries-old demonic entity or anything...  One of the other protagonists is Arren, a boy whom we see murder his own father (a king) and then run off with his father's sword.  He seems to be running from some sort of shadow entity that looks like him and that only he can see.  Well, okay then...but this shadow entity is only half-heartedly explained, and why Arren felt the need to murder his father is NEVER explained (and why did he steal the sword?).  At first, I thought that he was overcome with a fit of madness or something, but he later makes it sound like he did it on purpose, so I don't really know anymore.  At the end of the movie, a certain character turns into a dragon with absolutely no explanation given before or after the act.  The list goes on...

Another problem has to do with the characters themselves - none of them are particularly likable.  Some of them are rather un-offensive enough in their blandness (like Shadowhawk and Tenar) but your main character Arren is confusing due to the unexplained details mentioned earlier and Theru is downright unlikable for the first half of the film.  Why is she so ungrateful after being saved from the slave traders, and why is she so oddly hostile to Arren later?  Then Arren tells her that he murdered his father and she was right to hate him (although she wouldn't have known that) and THEN she starts liking him.  Huh?  Maybe she's just a stickler for brutal honesty and hates helpful people?  I don't know.  The real problem is that I just didn't feel attached to any of these characters by the end of it.  In Howl's Moving Castle, I felt a real connection with Sophie (who's a shy but likable protagonist who turns out to have a sense of humor) and Howl himself (who is at once charming, but also immature).  I just didn't feel much empathy for the characters in ""Tales"".

Another Ghibli film that this movie reminds me of is Castle in the Sky.  Castle in the Sky is pretty much an action adventure tale set in a fantasy world, much like Tales from Earthsea.  The difference is that Castle in the Sky had much better pacing.  It had slow moments here and there, but it balanced these with action scenes.  ""Tales"" doesn't pick up until the last half of the film, and although lots of Ghibli films are slower in pace, this one just felt tedious.  I can't quite seem to put my finger on exactly why this film feels slow and boring but other ""slow"" films such as ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" feel engaging and relaxing in their pacing.  Maybe it has to do with the fact that there are several scenes that feel completely unnecessary.  For example, the scene with the drug dealer was un-needed.  If their intent was to show that the city is corrupt, the scenes of the active slave trade were enough for that.  Plus, the slave traders are actually relevant to the plot later - that drug dealer is never seen or mentioned again.  Another scene that feels out of place is the opening, where we see a ship in a storm and a couple dragons fighting.  The presence of these dragons is never really explained, nor did I ever really get a feel for the significance of the dragons themselves.  Are they good, bad, neither?!

After finally getting a chance to watch this movie, I'd have to say that the lackluster reviews I read before are fairly accurate.  It's not that this film is simply horrible; the music is decent and the visuals are as stunning as any other Ghibli film, but it just pales next to better works.  I'd recommend that you rent it first to see if you'll like it.  I'd also recommend some better Ghibli films that have the same adventure-fantasy feel - namely ""Howl's Moving Castle"", ""Castle in the Sky"", and even ""Spirited Away"" or ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"".",1302048000,5,5838,4.469310670443815
2799038,4,B000OPPTN4,"I love Studio Ghibli's work. That being said this was not my favourite. It wasn't bad just not my favourite, it had beautiful art work, as always, a great story, and beautiful music. However, there are parts in this movie that creeped me and my 30 year old friend out.

2799039,2,B000OPPTN4,"Way back when this film was announced, I was ten, and the American anime industry was still a lucrative business. Companies like ADV and Geneon were thriving with amazing titles; anime sections in Best Buy still took up a whole aisle; you could throw a rock into a crowd and they would've heard of a mainstream shonen title that was on then-running Toonami. But this news would've perhaps been the best for even non-fans: the son of anime director genius, Hayao Miyazaki, was making a new movie. However, thanks to SciFi channel (now SyFy channel) owning the film rights to the Earthsea property, based upon Ursula Le Guin's fantastic novels, Disney could not legally bring this over.

Flash-forward to 2011. The anime industry in the west is severely crippled, Best Buy has a tiny shelf or two for anime, and only the kids who grew up with Naruto remember it. It's a different world now, but despite the changes, Studio Ghibli's work remains popular among even the mainstream crowd. So, it's my great displeasure to announce that this film has not aged well, after only five years, and may be the only blotch on this great studio's filmography.

""Tales"" follows a young prince who, for reasons initially unknown, has slain his father and now is on the run from the kingdom's knights. On his path, he has a run-in with a wizard by the name of Sparrowhawk, and they soon become travelling companions. From there on out they must evade the forces pursuing the prince, while combating one of Sparrowhawk's past rivals. If you're looking for anything a bit more complex than this, then you're out of luck. Putting aside the fact that this a pure truncation to Le Guin's work, it simply doesn't stand on it's own as a film. The plot is thin at best, and often has you wondering why you should even care what's happening to the protagonists.

This might be tolerable if the animation was on-par with other Ghibli works, but alas, the art direction is painfully dull. Long, sweeping shots of background cels pad out a good portion of the film's running time, and the characters all look very clich. Also distressing is the lack of detail on both the locations and characters. Trees often look like empty drawings with basic colors inside of them, and characters' garb is made of generally primary colors. Even supposedly defining characteristics, specifically Sparrowhawk's facial wound, end up looking like discoloration more than actual markings.

However, the saving grace for the film is perhaps the wonderful soundtrack and voice track. Tamiya Terashima's soundtrack is beautiful and moving, compensating for the lack of adventure and fantasy the actual plot and animation gives us. Also fantastic is the English dub, one of the best in a Miyazaki film, featuring the talents of Timothy Dalton (a rugged and wise Sparrowhawk) and Willem Defoe (bringing his creepy flair to antagonist Cob). Arren, the prince, is voiced by video game and American animation V.A. Matt Levin, who may be the only weak link here, coming across as somewhat flat and emotionless.

Still, top-notch audio can't save the crippling blows of bland animation and an even blander plot. Goro Miyazaki shows that the old phrase ""beginner's luck"" doesn't apply to everything, and that simply trying to imitate his father's style while ""adapting"" another work will not automatically make him as good. ""Tales from Earthsea"" is a whopping disappointment, and only should be seen by Ghibli completists. If you're truly curious, rent this out, but otherwise save yourself the disappointment from Ghibli's first mediocre film.",1300579200,2,3586,4.97

2799041,5,B000OPPTN4,"For those of us who cherish the films of Studio Ghibli and especially the master animator Hayao Miyazaki, it's always something of an event when a new film comes out. Tales from Earthsea is such an event, though it's actually the first film directed by his son, Goro, but according to the brief special feature doc, the Ursula LeGuin fantasy book and short story series was long envisioned by the senior Miyazaki as an animation project -- with Ms. LeGuin very much in favor of the full Ghibli treatment for her creation.

And that it does. Tales from Earthsea is a grand epic fantasy with astonishing design and scope. Though cel animated, CG is also used to enhanced the movement over ground surfaces, for depth and other imagery that would be more cumbersome (if possible) to be done by hand. It must be made clear that the CG serves the 2D animation rather than overwhelm it, much as it did in Beauty and the Beast and The Great Mouse Detective, only on a much bigger scale.

I'm no expert on the Earthsea stories, but from what I can estimate from various synopses, this film takes several characters and situations and crafts its own cohesive storyline, avoiding the intense intermingling of characters and arcs that weave throughout the LeGuin works. Overall, the film stands on its own, though we are left with a few loose ends here and there.

Few movies have the layered intelligence of Tales from Earthsea, with its musings on life, death and human existence within a very engrossing story about a youth who starts out on the run because of a murder he can't explain. He's mentored by an elder wizard and do some farming as well engage in as swashbuckling action...well you have to see it.",1300406400,,1700,4.66

However I have never read the Earthsea series, so I did not know what to expect going in.  The movie started out confusing me and just kind of went downhill from there.  The backgrounds were, as always fantastic, but the storyline seemed to be lacking major pieces to explain what was going on.  And the dragons seemed like badly spliced in CG among the rest of the animation.  Most of the expressions of the characters was limited and did not meet my expectations.  Still it had wonderful character designs and artwork, and the movie was entertaining.  Maybe I just have too high of standards for this animation company, but I do not think it was up to their normal standards.",1300406400,3,803,4.527777777777778
2799043,3,B000OPPTN4,"Tales from Earthsea is a work of art. Beautiful, immersive, with amazing characters and settings. In that sense, it is what I came to expect from Studio Ghibli, and more. It is definitely promising in that we can expect good things to come after Hayao Miyazaki's retirement. But still, it has some important flaws that left me scratching my head.

I don't understand why they decided to make the movie in the middle of the book series. Its like starting to watch Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings without seeing the first two movies. And there is not much background information given. If you read the books, you will understand some things, but if you didn't, it can be very confusing. For example, what is the deal with the ""true names""? What's up with Arren's shadow? Why did the wizard in the beginning forget his spell?

Still, even after reading the books, this movie has some minor plot holes in it. But I think it all stems from where in the story they decided to make the movie at. Perhaps if that horrible Sci-Fi miniseries didn't exist, we would be talking about an epic movie here.

For all its flaws, the movie remains enjoyable. The art is fantastic, the pace flows nicely, and there is plenty of action and drama. Disney also did a good job with the voice acting.

I would give it 3 and a half stars.",1300320000,2,1315,4.466666666666667
2799044,2,B000OPPTN4,"I am an ""amateur"" Studio Ghibli ""fanboy,"" so much so that I was counting down the days until ""Tales from Earthsea"" was finally released.  While I was waiting through that long, hard stretch, I even bought the first Earthsea book so that I could be a little better ""informed"" about what the movie was all about.  I thought that the book was pretty good, and, even as I was reading it, it did seem like something that was written with the purpose of being made into a Studio Ghibli film.  I also researched what people were saying about the film before I bought it, and I discovered that there was a lot of criticism about the film being ""boring"" and ""cliche.""  After finally watching the movie, I can say that it isn't as bad as I heard it would be, but the film is a rip-off of several other Hayao Miyazaki films, which proves that it lives up to its ""cliche"" label it had received early on.  While watching the film, there were several key sequences that I felt to be ripped straight from ""Nausicaa"" (the character Ged resembles Lord Yupa from ""Nausicaa"" to me, and the henchman from ""Earthsea"" really really resembles one of the henchmen from ""Nausicaa""); ""Castle in the Sky"" (the friendship between Arren Tehru in ""Earthsea"" is represented almost identically to the friendship between Sheeta and Pazu); and the film reminded me a little bit of ""Spirited Away"" with the common themes about the importance of one's true name.  When I was watching the film, there's a scene towards the end that reminded me so much of the scene in ""Spirited Away"" where Haku turns into a dragon and Sen rides off on his back that I guarantee there would have been some sort of lawsuits filed had the film-makers of both films not been father and son.  I don't think that this movie was quite as similar to ""Princess Mononoke"" as some people are trying to make it be, but, yes, there still are some similarities.  In addition to all the similarities, I thought that the last several minutes of Earthea really sucked; I didn't like that the fact that Arren killed his father was never followed up on later in the movie; and there were just some parts in the film that I thought were completely randomn and unnecessary so that I almost felt like I was watching a ""purposely bad"" film at points:  for example, I thought that the main villain was so campy and bizarre at the end of the film that I felt like I was watching an episode of ""Pokemon"" or ""Yu-Gi-Oh!,"" which, in these circumstances is pretty bad.  I liked some of the music, especially ""Therru's Song"" (the Japanese version, the English version sucked).  The main orchestral theme was really good, I thought, but the music still wasn't as memorable as many of the other Ghibli films I've seen.  I watched this film two times right after I bought it, amounting to 4 hrs. of my day, so you could say I somewhat enjoyed it.  I'm just glad that I was able to buy it on sale this week at Best Buy, as, although it wasn't terrible, it was pretty poor.  Did I mention that the character designs made Tehru look like she was half-panda bear?  Now that (no offense, Tehru) is what you call a ""burn.""",1299974400,2,3129,4.484154929577465

The characters look like those from Nausicaa and this film uses the black goopy effect widely used in 'Spirited Away' and 'Howls Moving Castle', you'll know what I mean if you've seen these films. The music has a celtic, almost medieval, feel to it and roots the film firmly in that period of history, especially with all the talk of wizards and the evil wizards castle. The story was disjointed and pretty incoherent at times and leaves you feeling unsatisfied at the end (hence the 3 stars). It is a long film, with not much substance. This film could've delivered so much more, but it was unoriginal and laboured, which is a great shame coming from such a renowned studio, and a studio, incidentally, I've loved every other film from.

Now people can finally quit complaining about other DVD release of this movie do not say ""Disney"" on the label. One of the most important benefits of this version is the easier to use menus, especially the fact that they are in English. Now onto the show. While others have complained about this movie, I enjoyed it. The most common complaints I hear are: First is ""it is not as good as Spirited Away or other big films from Hayao Miyazaki."" In fact the honorable Mr. Miyazaki did not make this movie, his son Goro Miyazaki headed up the team at Studio Ghibli that made it. So we need not hold this first time effort up to the incredible standards of the more recent films by Hayao. It is still really good, and over time I believe his son time will continue to hone his skills/experience to the suceed his father when the time comes. And isn't that a good thing for the future, Hayao cannot make movies forever. And I believe that if you measure it against Hayao's early films it holds up very nicely .
The next complaint I hear is ""it does not follow the original Earthsea books"".  I believe they adapted the film concept from a Japanese set of graphic novels, which were in turn based on Ursula K LeGuin's books of Earthsea. I have read all of the original books and do love them, but I would suggest forgetting the source when you watch this as the movie and the books have little to do with each other. It is not uncommon that movie adaptions of books are far from following the source book, this is not the first. There is also a live action Earthsea film out there, and it is pretty bad. I tried to approach this film as a fresh story and pushed out of my mind what I know of Earthsea.
So here is what is really GOOD about this animated film. I found the character development to be well done and believable, and after awhile I found I was caring what happened to them. The animation was very fluid, nice backgrounds, great sound, great character and background design. There are big beautiful landscapes, interesting creatures, and nice art design. The real weakness, if any, viewers is in the plot/script and how slowly it progresses. But it seems to me the director was taking intentional pauses, slowing us down to the time and culture of the people in the story. I suggest you give it a chance with an open mind and do not hold it up to such a high standard as Spirited Away. It is a good movie, and stands quite well on its own.

2799049,4,B000OPPTN4,"""Tales from Earthsea"" is a Miyazaki movie. Just not THE Miyazaki.

No, this extremely loose adaptation of Ursula le Guin's Earthsea series is directed by Hayao Miyazaki's son, Goro Miyazaki. And it has the earmarks of a promising first effort -- the visuals are hauntingly lovely, the dialogue is sometimes beautiful, and there's raw passion in its making. But honestly, the story is often confusing.

The archmage Sparrowhawk encounters a young boy named Prince Arren in the desert, and takes him under his wing. Arren is on the run from his own kingdom after committing a horrible crime, and Sparrowhawk is out to find out why magic seems to be draining out of the world, and darkness is creeping into people's hearts.

After some misadventures with slavers, they make their way to Sparrowhawk's friend/love interest Tenar, and her adopted daughter Therru. Unfortunately, the malevolent mage Cob has learned of Sparrowhawk's presence nearby, and plans to use Arren in his quest for eternal life and revenge againt Sparrowhawk... unless Therru can help her friend come to terms with his inner darkness.

For the record, ""Tales From Earthsea"" is just a stunning movie visually -- ivy-draped cities, azure seaports, dark looming castles against twilight skies, and long sweeping green fields dotted with trees in the morning sun. There's a genuine sense of magic and mystery to this world, and you can really feel the passion that Miyazaki had for his story.

However, the story itself is kind of mixed. The dialogue is strong and often hauntingly powerful (""But only to men is it given to know that we must die, and that is a precious gift""), and the story has some scenes that are . But the narrative is often confusing -- the murky cosmology, undeveloped backstory (what are the tombs of Atuan?), and the whole subplot about Arren is just befuddling.

Most of the story's character development centers on Arren. He seems like a nice polite young boy, but from his very first shocking scene we see that darkness and despair are slowly consuming him. Miyazaki crafts a solid father/son relationship between Arren and Sparrowhawk, and the archmage is also a powerful character -- understanding, forgiving, and universally kind.

Miyazaki also spins up a solid bond between Sparrowhawk and his old friend Tenar, who have the comfortable feel of an old married couple. Therru is flawed, though -- she's not really fleshed out much, and she does something near the movie's end that left me scratching my head. It wasn't really foreshadowed or hinted at -- it just happens.

As for the villain Cob... uh, he seems like just a pallid effeminate villain at first, but he gets progressively creepier as we see more of him. Example: the scene where he slips Arren a roofie to get his true name. That was... disturbing.

Goro Miyazaki isn't the master that his father is, but there is still plenty of power, beauty and promise in his movie debut, ""Tales From Earthsea."" It's kind of confusing (especially if you've never read the books), but a worthy anime.",1290211200,7,3047,4.923976608187134

""Tales from Earthsea"" is an adaptation of Ursula le Guin's beloved ""Earthsea"" series, which for many years was composed of only three books, but which now includes at least six installments.

There was already a connection between Hayao Miyazaki and the Earthsea books; he claims to have been heavily influenced by their worldviews and mythologies, both of which avoided the tradition black-and-white depictions of good and evil. Twenty years ago Miyazaki attempted to get the rights to adapt Earthsea, but le Guin refused - a decision that she came to regret after watching several of his films.

After the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/disastrous-miniseries/dp/B00077BPA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">disastrous miniseries</a>&nbsp;and after realizing the incredible talent of the Studio Ghibli, le Guin gave her consent for an adaptation (suggesting perhaps that the film could take place in the ten or so years that passed between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Wizard-of-Earthsea/dp/0553383043/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Wizard of Earthsea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tombs-of-Atuan/dp/1416509623/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tombs of Atuan</a>). But by this stage, Miyazaki considered himself too old to direct another movie, and the project was passed on to his son Goro Miyazaki, with assurances that nothing would be done without Miyazaki's consent.

However, it's well documented that not only did Miyazaki not retire from film-making, but that there was significant conflict between himself and his son during the filming of ""Tales from Earthsea,"" all of which threw the quality of the project in doubt and left le Guin with a lukewarm reception to the finished project (though this paled in comparison to her lambasting of the Sci-Fi miniseries). You can read more on her website, something that most fans of the books will be interested in perusing.

But on to the movie itself. As a depiction of ""Earthsea"" it doesn't deliver. As a film standing on its own merits, it's a flawed but intriguing piece. As a work of art and as a dose of entertainment, it excels. It is best described as an adaptation of the third book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Farthest-Shore/dp/141650964X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Farthest Shore</a>&nbsp;what with its inclusion of Cob and the use of Arren as the protagonist, but it also draws upon the idea of the Shadow from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Wizard-of-Earthsea/dp/0553383043/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Wizard of Earthsea</a>&nbsp;and includes the character of Therru, who doesn't turn up until the forth book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tehanu/dp/1416509631/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tehanu</a>.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tombs-of-Atuan/dp/1416509623/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tombs of Atuan</a>&nbsp;is completely skipped, though Tenar mentions it briefly.

The archipelago known as Earthsea is beset by a strange entropy that nobody can explain. The first ten minutes of the film introduces an ominous dragon fight, rumors of pestilence and failing crops, and the shocking assassination of the king. Unfortunately, the rest of the film bears little resemblance to this strong opening. A wandering, earthy wizard called Sparrowhawk crosses paths with the haunted, twitchy Prince Arren, a figure perturbed by something that only he can see. Together they join up in the journey to Hort, a colorful but corrupt city filled with slave-traders and drug-dealers.

After a run in with both, Sparrowhawk takes Arren to the farm of an old friend: Tenar and her foster-daughter Therru, a moody and scarred girl who doesn't easily warm to Arren's presence. But the little gathering is threatened by supernatural forces: not only the unsettling figure of Cob, a malevolent wizard who desires immortality, but also an eerie doppelganger that stalks Arren wherever he goes.

It is a promising set-up, but the story itself fails on several fronts. We never get an understanding as to why the world's equilibrium is out of balance, or whether Cob is responsible for it. There is no clear idea on what exactly Arren's shadow is; in fact, it abruptly changes from a villainous doppelganger to a helpful guide halfway through the movie. The king's murder is has no ramifications or explanations. The fighting dragons at the start have nothing to do with the rest of the film, though one turns up as a blatant dues ex machina at the climax (which only opens up more questions about a central character).

We're never given any clear idea of who Sparrowhawk is or what he's trying to achieve at any given moment - for such a powerful figure, he's disappointingly reactive rather than proactive. As beautifully rendered as it is, there's little emotional investment made in the wellbeing of the land that the heroes are trying to save, and there are inconsistencies in its level of fragility (despite claims that flocks and crops are failing, Tenar lives on what looks like a perfectly healthy farm). The last half is a fantasy-action film, full of sword-fights and collapsing staircases - visually exciting, but which feels like it belongs to a different movie than the slower and more introspective first half.

When a novel like ""Earthseas"" is recognized as being popular, best-selling and award-winning, it's safe to assume that the author knows what she's doing when she tells a story. So why mess with it?

But ""Tales of Earthsea"" shouldn't be dismissed on account of its rather garbled story. As with every Studio Ghibli production, it is a beautiful, imaginative, vivid work of art. On display are large sea galleons stranded in the midst of the desert, a bustling market held among crumbling edifices, abandoned farms lying along country roads; all of which calls to mind the Japanese concept of ""mono no aware"", the sense of melancholy and transient beauty that is forever fading. Yet at the same time there is an emphasis and appreciation for life and its simple rewards. There are scenes of hard-work around the farm, in which sitting down for a good meal or getting a comfortable night's sleep is given just as much emphasis as flight on a dragon's back.

For all its flaws, ""Tales from Earthsea"" is a worthwhile film. It's beautifully rendered and populated with likeable characters, flows at a smooth pace and is a promising beginning for a first-time director.",1285545600,134,7094,5.9450980392156865

And I'm also a great admirer of the senior Miyazaki's work. So I approached the movie with considerable anticipation. But in the end, I guess that it just wasn't a good match. The animation is of course impeccable, as I've come to expect from Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, but overall the movie is simply bland, without the imagination that I've come to expect from studio Ghibli, even those such as ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" that are based upon works created by others. The central character is not very appealing, and the nature of his problem (I'm avoiding spoilers here) is never really adequately conveyed, so the resolution does not come off. Even the action seems a bit bland. Probably worth seeing, but don't expect too much.",1283212800,2,881,4.802631578947368

2799056,4,B000OPPTN4,"In all respect to the other reviews here, I think it is time to clear up some misconceptions or questions about this movie, including: How to navigate the menus? is it bootleg? how to get it to play in English? why doesn't it say Disney on the label? why isn't it like Spirited Away?.... etc.
First let's address the bootleg issue.  The version on the page I am writing this review for is a ""Region 3"" disc, not made for USA DVD players which are Region 1 unless you own a region free player. Region 3 is S.Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, parts of South East Asia. Japan is Region 2 by the way. The copy sold on this page is probably Korean or Taiwan, and I do not think it is bootleg. Studio Ghibli has to have a local distribution company in each country they release in, and Inter Continental is a distribution company in the Asian market. The real issue is that it has not been released in an official US version yet, but has been in the Asian market for a long time.
My copy is a single disc copy I ordered on the web a year ago for about $25, it is made in Taiwan by Bonzai Media, is a Region 1 disc, but is not bootleg. The menus on mine are not in English either, but are in several Asian languages and I suspect the menu is identical to the disc sold on this page. The menu languages seem to be Japanese, Korean, and Chinese. After figuring out the menu by trial and error, I was able to play the movie in English audio voices, well done I might add, by clicking the third icon on the menu page, taking me to another menu page where I clicked the third icon again, then clicked the icon on the far and lower right of that page to start playing in English. That's it.
The Disney thing - Disney has not released in the USA everything that Hayao Miyazaki has made. Also, his Studio Ghibli releases films from other directors at the studio, not just the famous Hayao and they have not even released all of their stuff either. Which brings me to my next point. This film is a project directed by the son of the famous Hayao Myazaki, his name is Goro Miyazaki. So we need not hold this first time effort up to the standards you expect of the more recent films by Hayao, and we need to give his son time to build up his skills/experience to the current level of his father. I believe that if you measure it against Hayao's early films it holds up.
As for the movie, I believe they adapted it from a Japanese set of comics or graphic novels, which were in turn based on Ursula K LeGuin's books of Earthsea. I have read the original books and do love them, but I would suggest forgetting them when you watch this as they have little to do with each other. Movie adaptions of books are far from following the source book the majority of the time, this is not the first. There is also a live action Earthsea, and it is pretty bad.  I tried to approach this film as a fresh story and pushed out of my mind what I know of Earthsea, and here is what is GOOD about it as an animated feature. I found the character development to be well done and believable, and I was caring what happened to them by the end. The animation was very fluid, great sound, great character and background design. The real weakness from most viewers is in the plot/script and how slowly it progresses. But it seems to me the director was taking intentional pauses, slowing us down to the time and culture of the people in the story. I suggest if you find this movie, give it a chance with an open mind and do not hold it up to such a high standard as Spirited Away.",1266019200,73,3530,4.1820851688693095

The landscapes were beautiful and picturesque but that is the extent of the film for me. We were horrified to see that the writers scrambled all four books into an incoherent mess. Confusing and removing most of what made these novels such timeless classics. No coherent explanation justified Arren's murder of his father let alone giving him the shadow. Unforgivable.

About the film
It is based off of the Ursula K. Le Guin book by the same name and is a story based latter in the series of the Earthsea books.
The movie's story does move slowly but it is in keeping with the pace of the Earthsea books. So it should be expected by those who have also read any number of them. The movie's British cast did an excellent job and I was very pleased and impressed. When licensing allows for a full American release there would be no need for voices so it should have direct release I would hope.

Overall it is an excellent movie and played out well. Even after several rejected film scripts by Le Guin. I have to laugh at this because she sounds like myself. Always looking out for ones own art and protecting what's most valuable.
 I also must confess I have not read this book because it was written latter than the others in this series and I haven't had the chance to pick it up. So a person who has read the book may have a different opinion on the film than my own. I give it four stars because it has been awhile since I first saw this and have not read the book plus as said the movie is a bit slow paced. None the less it is an excellent anime film and is worth seeing.

2799063,3,B000OPPTN4,"The storyline has been summarised clearly in a number of other reviews, so I'll stick to some responses to the film. I looked forward to watching this movie, being a big fan of Miyazaki senior's output, which are remarkable for their detailed and well-paced plots, strong characters and animation. Visually his films are rich, detailed and at times breathtakingly beautiful.

I found the film directed by his son came up short on all the above aspects. The narrative was slackly paced and not always clearly explained, eg the murder of the king by Arren. Also, the scenes at the farm in the middle of the farm tended to drag and fall back on dialogue to explain character and plot. The characters tended towards the two dimensional. There were striking moments visually but it was simply not of the same standard of animation as ""Spirited Away"" or ""Howl's Moving Castle"". Others have commented on how much they liked the music but I found the song to be overly sentimental. I also felt this way about the closing scenes at the farm with them sharing the farm chores.

So, not a direct adaptation of the Earthsea novels, but a hodge-podge of ideas inspired by it. Studio Ghibli didn't get give this an American release until 2011 by GKIDS largely due to Syfy Channel having its own TV mini-series based on Earthsea, withholding any home video for several years, but did finally get a recent Blu-Ray release too.

 In a fantasy alternate world, humans that accepted using the elements of earth, water, and wind were considered wizards, but those who utilized fire were said to be transformed into flying dragons, two of which are seen fighting near the kingdom of Elad. The king plans on investigating this, but is shockingly killed by his son, Prince Arren, who runs away believing he was being controlled by his darker half. Arren encounters a wandering wizard named Sparrowhawk, later revealed to be a former Archmage. He rescues Arren from slavers working for the dark sorcerer Cob, who seeks vengeance against Sparrowhawk for defeating him in a previous adventure. Arren and Sparrowhawk get shelter at a farm owned by Sparrowhawk's colleague Tenar, who also has taken in the orphen Tenar, a former priestess with a shocking past. Cob takes in Arren in an attempt to get revenge against Sparrowhawk, and somehow put together a spell for immortality.

Tales From Earthsea is visually one of Studio Ghibli's fairer films, but the mixing of so many resources and backstories make for a profoundly convoluted production. There's lots of tangled plotlines and unexplained character motivations that require anyone seeing this for this first time to consult an Earthsea resource guide. The English dub is acceptable with Timothy Dalton and Willem Dafoe pulling off great performances, even though the dubbed script seriously restrains their acting chops. It's worth checking out on demand or on Netflix, but due to the sub-standard animation and confusing narrative it's hard to recommend owning.",1521158400,,2168,5.135977337110481
