7953304,1,B00005T315,"Hopefully, no one gets fooled into buying this. I rented it from the library. It says it has the original ""limited animation"" version of Frosty the Snowman from the 1950s. That's a complete lie. The actual snowman cartoon doesn't mention the name ""Frosty"" at all. It's simply called ""The Snow Man."" It's not a happy movie about snowman coming to life. It's about an evil snowman brought to life who tries to eat everyone. He's finally melted by the protaganist.

The packaging for this movie is completely misleading. It shows a happy snowman carrying a Christmas present. But, as I said, the snowman in question is an evil snowman. And the cartoon has nothing to do with Christmas. I have no idea how they can even get away with using the name ""Frosty the Snowman"" on the title of the DVD.

In addition, the quality of the transfer was very poor, with intermittent bright spots.

The Snow Man is only 6 minutes long. There are 6 over movies on the DVD, but I didn't even bother watching it.

A huge recommendation to avoid.",1226102400,4,1024,4.579234972677596
