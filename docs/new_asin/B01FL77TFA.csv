8761058,5,B01FL77TFA,"My Grandma who was born in 1928 LOVES these shows! Im bewildered because she is such a gentle soul and Law & Order SVU can be so violent, and deals with some very demented, disturbing subjects... When I asked she says she finds them ""Interesting"". I think she is a secret criminal investigator :) My husband and I just bought her the entire 17 seasons! Thank you Amazon for making it possible to keep Grandma enthusiastic about figuring out who the bad guy is and why hes doing what he is doing! Thank you L&O SVU for creating such a fertile ground for thought, conjecture and life lessons. (Mostly what NOT to do)",1508025600,,614,4.442477876106195
