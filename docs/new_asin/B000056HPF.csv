1397345,5,B000056HPF,"not fair, not fair. Citizen Cane is an alright little picture, good for a sunday afternoon i suppose. But this... this thing is a masterpiece! Everything that's good about being young, male, and stupid is right here. Poppin' pills, smokin' grass, camping out, loving the ladies, spooking the ""townfolk""... all set to a blistering backbeat of fuzzed out psychedelic instro madness! I dare you to not at least scratch your head in confusion over how wonderful this thing is. true blue eye candy. beautiful women, far out dialogue, almost threatening bikers, and some great tunes. the dvd packs more features that you could imagine for such an obscure film. trailers, tv spots, photo galleries, behind the scenes, commentaries etc... an excellent buy. a movie you'll want to share with your grandchildren. trust me, baby.",986256000,7,818,5.111940298507463
1397346,3,B000056HPF,"Al Adamson's best film - BY FAR!! A lot of Al's work was patch work schlock combining footage from unfinished films, but this was a project that was finished from begining to end. Although not as technicaly polished as EASY RIDER from the same year it sure has dated a lot better and their is not a dull moment in the film. Russ Tamblyn and Scott Brady help give this better acting than other Adamson films and it is the most violent and nastiest biker film i have seen (their is also some dark humor). so if your a fan of horror/exploitation films this is a must see!!",986169600,3,569,4.277777777777778

1397416,1,B000056HPF,"What a piece of garbage in so many ways.  My copy was so bad I couldn't tell what kind of bikes they were riding, looked like they copied it off a tv.  then the plot and characters yech is all I can say.  I wouldn't even give this one away it's that bad. Right in the garbage it went.",1380326400,2,284,3.7796610169491527
1397417,3,B000056HPF,This is not your normal 60's/70's biker film...a little corny and no known actors it has a twist. The bikers don't win in this B rated drive-in flick. None the less..well worth the money to own.,1356480000,,194,4.416666666666667
1397418,3,B000056HPF,Typical of the genre! Lot's of action with a typical view of bikers in the 60's.,1199750400,,80,4.0625
1397419,1,B000056HPF,"This is one horrible f***in' movie.  It is one of the most boring, tepid, lame films I have ever endured.  This is the kind of film that Tarantino and Rodriguez were paying homage to in their recent film Grindhouse.  Why would they like trash like this?  It's not entertaining, it's not fun, it's just stupid and ugly.  There are some decent biker films out there (Savage Seven and Hell's Angels on Wheels are 2 examples), but this is just the bottom of the NYC sewer system.  Save your time and money...",1176940800,3,504,4.483516483516484
1397420,1,B000056HPF,"You know, I tried, but I can't make myself see anything redeemable in any of the bad guys...lending this movie no moral complexity or statement about society almost at all.  Any feeling of pity you might have for the mental illness, mental deficiency, psychological problems, or disability of all the characters is completely shot when they rape several women in drawn out, annoying, and uncomfortable rape scenes.

I'm a fan of horror movies, and a huge consumer of B-movies in general.  Rape scenes in which the women seem to like it cross the line into unwatchable for me.

I'd have to reccomend you watch Hard Rock Zombies instead.",1136592000,5,635,4.851851851851852
1397421,4,B000056HPF,"This movie is a classic example of ""Life Imitates Art"". Many a bike club was built on the premise of this and many other 60's scooter tramp flicks like this one. Own a piece of American counter-culture and add this jem to your library!",1074902400,,235,4.363636363636363
1397422,5,B000056HPF,"The movie starts promisingly with a couple indulged in petting suddenly interrupted by a gang of bikers. They drug the girl and rape her, then set the forcibly drugged and drunk couple in their car and roll the car over the edge of a cliff.
And the action never stops in this fine drive-in classic biker movie dubbed by producer Sam SHERMAN as the ""CITIZEN KANE of biker movies"". Well, I don't agree to that (in my view the best biker film of all time is the Spanish THE MAD FOXES), but SATAN`S SADISTS is great fun nevertheless.
The further plot concerns a former marine hitchhiking through the California desert, who is offered a lift by a middle-aged couple, a cop and his wife on second honeymoon. They decide to have a meal at a roadside diner. Suddenly the biker gang arrive at the diner! You can probably guess, what happens next: the bikers make trouble, molesting the waitress and harrass the cop's wife, prompting the cop to draw a revolver. Things get nasty, resulting in the policeman's wife getting raped (unfortunately we don't get to see too much nudity here) and the death of the cop, his wife and the diner's owner. The ex-marine and the waitress escape in the desert, killing two bikers in the process. One guy meets a particularly nasty end by being drowned in the toilet! The furious bikers give chase and the couple must fight for their life...
WOW! They don't make movies like that anymore. SATAN`S SADISTS is a sleaze masterpiece, full of violence, nudity, violent sex and drug abuse. The film is rather anti-establishment, like many movies of the period. And the characters are really cool! Sure, the ex-marine is a bit boring as well as his new found girlfriend, the waitress. But the bikers deliver. Particularly Russ TAMBLYN is great as the cool but psychopathic gang's boss Anchor. He delivers a nice anti-establishment speech before shooting the cop and the other victims at the diner. And his accomplices are a rather weird bunch! Two of the gang members are handicapped, a biker is one-eyed (but wears sunglasses nonetheless), another even needs a hearing aid (!). The only concern of the bikers seems to be sex and getting stoned. And the dialogue is sometimes over the top - like when the bikers encounter three girls in the desert, one of them sunbathing topless, which prompts one biker to remark ""She is keeping her milk warm.""
Oh yeah, I really love this movie.
The DVD itself is filled with lots of extra features. First, there is an introduction to the movie vy producer Sam SHERMAN, who talks about how cool the film is and that it has gained a cult following worldwide. This segment however looks like it was shot 100 years ago.
Producer SHERMAN also appears in an interesting interview. This guy knows some stories to tell and it is fun to listen to him. The producer also provided an audiocommentary on which I can not comment, because I did not listen to it and I am generally not a fan of audiocommentaries. However I did listen to the radio interview with Regina CARROL, wife of director Al ADAMSON and staring in SATAN`S SADISTS as ""freak-out girl"". It is a promotional piece and again fun to listen to. There is also a gallery of behind-the-scenes photographs, presented in a way, as if they were shown in a drive-in theatre.
Then there is the film's trailer, which is outstanding. It starts with a disclaimer: THE SHOCKING SCENES YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE ARE NOT SUGGESTED FOR THE WEAK OR IMMATURE. IF YOU CANNOT TAKE IT, WE ADVISE YOU TO NOW PATRONIZE THE CONCESSION STAND OR LOOK AWAY FROM THE SCREEN DURING THIS PREVIEW OF ""SATAN'S SADISTS"". The trailer promotes the film with the tagline A REBELLION OF HUMAN GARBAGE! Seeing is believing.
There are also 3 TV teaser trailers for the film as well as four additional trailers for other films, all directed by Al ADAMSON: DRACULA VS. FRANKENSTEIN (trashy beyond belief, only for diehard trash film fans), the slightly better zombie romp BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR, ANGELS WILD WOMEN (a promising looking exploitation flick) and GIRLS FOR RENT (titled erronously I SPIT ON YOUR CORPSE on the trailer menue) starring XXX actress Georgina SPELVIN of THE DEVIL IN MRS. JONES fame.
A great disc!
If you like entertaining, violent, politically incorrect B-movies, buy it! You won't be disappointed.",1056585600,25,4285,4.745308310991957
1397423,2,B000056HPF,"This is the most overrated film I've seen in a while. I hoped for a violent, sexist, stark, disturbing biker film, and I got cheese. The motorcycles are awful, some of them are like dirt bikes and others no self-respecting biker would ever ride. The Satans colors look like iron-on patches. The violence is very antiseptic, with very litte gore, almost no nudity, and no realism. The plot and continuation are pathetic; could someone explain to me how the manniken-haired ""good guy"" got up that mountain so quick at the end to fight Firewater, or better yet, why? Also, the picture and sound quality are abyssmal, rendering whole sections of  the movie unwatchable.  A total waste of time and money, and completely misrepresented by anyone who gives it a good review.",1051488000,9,767,4.847328244274809
1397424,4,B000056HPF,"This 60's biker movie is a lot of fun. Rampaging biker gang with psycho leader, older couple on vacation, good-guy marine and the young waitress - priceless. I could have done without the rape scenes, but the camera didn't dwell on them too long.
The acting really couldn't be much better. Excellent characters. Apparently filmed in 11 days. Doesn't get much better for b-biker flicks.",996796800,12,385,4.938461538461539
7931962,5,B000056HPF,"This is a different kind of 'biker' flick.  Russ Tamblyn, as the biker leader, is a more crazed intellectual type, who on one hand supports the hippie 'love and peace' idea, but his actions demonstrate  pure merciless killing and torture and a deep seated anger and hatred of society and 'the man.'  Tamblyn carries this movie to a different, if more troubling, direction. They are a pack of sociopaths, who show that a young man can become devoid of morality without positive mentors early in life.
His character is a study in psychological contradiction. He is an intelligent leader who could have been successful at anything in life but,like the seed that fell on barren ground, failed to sprout.  He believes in himself only which leads to his ultimate downfall.  His character is not without sympathy as he reveals a certain sadness about his upbringing and why he is what he is now.  I found this to be more than just an action biker flick and more of a psychological drama. Tamblyn shows that his character is complex, but ultimately evil. The outward theme is 'good vs evil' and good wins..but it's more than that.",1518048000,,1122,4.728205128205128
