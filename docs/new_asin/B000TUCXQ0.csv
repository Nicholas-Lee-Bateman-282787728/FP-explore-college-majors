8210972,5,B000TUCXQ0,"I had purchased another DVD,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Learn-Handgun-Rifle-Reloading-in-Under-41-Minutes/dp/B0006PT29Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Learn Handgun & Rifle Reloading in Under 41 Minutes</a>, from this company and was quite happy with it so when I decided to explore muzzleloading I checked this out. The DVD starts with how barrel twist affects round balls and conicals differently which is important in choosing the gun you plan to purchase.  I wasn't planning on building a muzzleloader myself, but the building section did explain how the simple mechanics work which could be helpful in the field. And I actually copied the set of the wooden blocks used to protect the stock from our vice while finishing the stock for other projects.  Unlike other videos this one includes bullet casting, which is much easier than I had assumed.  Graphics are used to enhance messages like the dangers of lead poisoning, and the need to keep away from water while casting.

  What I get a kick from is that unlike other videos which seem to promote products in straight-laced format, this video actually shows you how a spark can set off an explosion and uses a cannon to demonstrate how black powder is more explosive than Pyrodex.  I've seen other videos where they imply by not saying it, that Pyrodex is just as good as black powder in side-eared guns.  Here the narrator just comes out and says, use only black powder in a side-eared gun.

The shooting section covers what you need to know to stay safe, from seating your bullet firmly on the charge (with an animation) to the importance of wearing eye and ear protection with pieces of percussion cap blowing up by your face.

The difference between round balls and conicals is shown by showing both shot from the same gun.  Devices that can help you, like a CO2 bullet extractor are demonstrated and compared to the bullet screw. And the use of speed loaders and just how to minimum the things you need take into the field are covered too. One emphasis that I liked is how to save money on supplies.  I've seen videos where it is suggested you buy their brand of patch, their brand of cleaner. Here it shows how to cut your own patches, or just use boiling water to clean your barrel as well as commercial sprays, foams,and manufactured patches.

If there is a weakness here it is that flintlock ignition systems are not covered. Though if you are interested in flintlock shooting the kit making, ball throwing, barrel loading, and shooting are the same for both.

The strengths here are in the details.  Here it shows how to keep your chronograph far enough away when measuring bullet speed so you are not measuring the speed of your smoke, powder debris, or patch.  What you need to buy is covered, with alternatives. (Though I have to recommend the CO2 bullet extractor which is a must the first time you load a bullet and forget the powder.) If you want a straightforward, easy to understand video that isn't promoting a specific product line, check this out.",1199577600,9,3069,4.953216374269005
