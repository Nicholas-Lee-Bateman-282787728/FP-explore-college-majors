8317621,4,B001L9EXRK,It was a good concert but Nina was so serious at time and the music was sad most of the time.  I understand that those were sad times back then.  I loved the second concert a lot more!,1457827200,,184,3.8157894736842106

8317624,5,B001L9EXRK,"~ Captivating. Spellbinding. Powerful. This video captures Nina Simone in the midst of her social conscious period that spanned 1963 to 1970.
~ Two concerts: the first recorded in Holland on 25 December 1965; the second recorded in England on 14 September 1968. In both concerts she is supported by an excellent sympathetic jazz combo.
~ The songs are all poignant with powerful messages of political and social importance. Nina's delivery varies from intensely serious to humorous, but the message is never lost. She varies her voice from song to song and even verse to verse with a song as appropriate for the lyrics. Sometimes she becomes so deeply involved in the song that it looks like she has forgotten that there is an audience.
~ Song titles: Brown Baby, Four Women, The Ballade of Hollis Brown, Tomorrow Is My Time, Images, Go Limp, Mississippi Goddamn, Go To Hell, Ain't Got No / I Got Life, Backlash Blues, I Put A Spell on You, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood, Why? (The King of Love is Dead).
~ Nina Simone fans will recognize many of these titles from her recordings of the time for Philips and RCA. Like the great Ray Charles, when Nina Simone sings a song she puts her own stamp on it. Compare her version of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" to the version by the Animals in the same era. Hard to tell they are the same song. Likewise, ""I Put a Spell on You"" is a far cry from the version by Screamin' Jay Hawkins.
~ Highly recommended.",1356480000,4,1450,4.538167938931298
