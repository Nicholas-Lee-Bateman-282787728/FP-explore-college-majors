This movie ends up as part of my collection of total losers (I have 1300 titles of excellent movies and 2-3 losers).  I keep a few to remind myself about how bad movies can be. The humor was so bad no one laughed, it was horrible and a waste of time.",1390262400,,394,4.012820512820513

8251945,2,B0013LL2V6,"THE LAST REQUEST opens with Woody Allen-ish titles, but any similarity between his work and this moribund film ends right there.

Except for one scene where the terminally ill Danny Aiello is given a birthday cake shaped like a casket, there's no laughs here. Especially egregious is when one of Danny's two sons and his new bride drop dead after a honeymoon mutual climax. Other disappointments: Gilbert Gottfried's cameo is squandered as he has no lines. Frank Vincent's priest vanishes after a minute. Joe Piscopo as the shrink with a shoemaking fetish tries but a dreadful script fails him.

This is the story of Jeff (T.R. Knight), a young seminary student (and surviving brother) who gives up his priesthood dreams to fulfill a dying father's last wish: a male heir to carry on his name. The socially introverted Jeff has only a short time before his old man passes in which to romance and wed a young lady. Thus begins his disastrous foray into the dating scene, with each encounter more bizarre than the last.

It's only a matter of time before Jeff picks up a transgendered gal who used to be his high school buddy. Ho hum. He dates hookers, kooks and other lousy candidates while the ideal woman is right under his nose. You know they're gonna get together as sure as that laughing hyena old man is gonna croak. The problem is the waste of 90 minutes it takes to reach those Woody-like final credits. This one's room temperature right from the start.

8251947,5,B0013LL2V6,"Wow,

Just watched The Last Request. What a great throwback to the fun wacky movies that just aren't made anymore. It looks like the cast had a blast making it. Kudos to writer John DeBellis for not worrying about being politically correct. I'm surprised it was released first on dvd and not shown at the theaters. It's one of those movies that gets better every time you watch it. I highly recommend it.",1208822400,3,404,4.534246575342466
