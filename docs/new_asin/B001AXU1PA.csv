3473216,5,B001AXU1PA,"No doubt about it.  Praise baby Videos are a genius idea!  I loved them when my first daughter was little, and I am excited to see they have added to the collection.  I enjoy them as much as the kids do.  I feel really good about sitting them down to a half-hour of television If I need the time.  And, of course, my children learn the praise songs easily and are often running around the house singing them!",1259712000,,408,4.17948717948718

My 20 month-old granddaughter absolutely loves this video!  She goes to the shelf, picks this one out and takes it to her mother when she wants to watch it.  It is the perfect blend of audio and video to settle her down before nap or bedtime.  I'm thrilled that my granddaughter is hearing songs about God and Jesus!",1233187200,7,520,6.848484848484849
3473221,5,B001AXU1PA,This Praise Baby may be the best one yet. We have 3 of the Praise Baby DVD's and I love the calming effect this one has when my 1 year old is upset or tired. I highly recommend this video to anyone with small children. I even listen to it when I am by myself!,1225324800,5,259,3.727272727272727

3473223,5,B001AXU1PA,"The Praise Baby Collection has been such a blessing to my four year old grandson who is severely disabled. The Praise Baby DVD's give him so much peace that his Mom is even able to get him through his therapies while listening and watching. This new one include his favorite song ""Jesus Loves Me"". We would be lost without this musical/visual collection. It is the only source of comfort to him at home and even at the hospital after surgeries. I hope they never stop producing these amazing DVD's. The music is inspiring and worshipful and the colorful illustrations are for everyone to enjoy.
A very grateful Grandmother",1220313600,15,622,4.768518518518518
3473224,5,B001AXU1PA,"This is a great DVD. It is filled with Christian praise and worship songs with video of children and babies playing with toys and things, animals, a few adults, etc.. I was very happy to see a sweet little baby with Down Syndrome on the DVD too. You can choose to watch the video in three different ways: with a woman singer, with a little girl singer, or solely instrumental (if I remember correctly, it's piano). All three choices are nice. The woman's voice is very soft and pretty. The little girl's voice is also very soft and beautiful. Every choice is good. My daughter likes the child singer the best, and I think I do too. This isn't like Baby Einstein but I like it better. My daughter has had this since she was a baby and it has taught her some nice songs. It's a nice change from watching noisy and annoying cartoons with shrill-voiced characters.",1434412800,2,860,4.449367088607595
3473225,5,B001AXU1PA,I love the praise songs on this video! My 4 yr old will still sit and watch this video.,1426723200,,87,3.6315789473684212

3473231,5,B001AXU1PA,So sweet to see the ones you love most clapping their hands in worship... Even as young as 5 months. My nephew was enthralled and precious as he sat in my lap and watched. Given it as gifts many times and always been told later what a blessing it was.,1412812800,,251,4.04
3473232,5,B001AXU1PA,"Our 6-month old son loves this DVD.  Even if he's fussy, it has a remarkable ability to calm him down and lull him to sleep in a happy mood.  The music and the scenes get progressively more soothing as the DVD plays, and like clockwork, our son goes to sleep. We couldn't be happier with it.",1411862400,,291,4.178571428571429

3473245,5,B001AXU1PA,"The first time my toddler and I watched this DVD we didn't like it.  Neither of us watched it the whole way through.  It seemed low budget and eclectic.

But after a few nights my toddler now absolutely loves this DVD and wants me to sit and watch it with him before bed.  The theme of the DVD goes from somewhat upbeat music to quieter, softer music and shows children putting away toys and starting to lay down to sleep.  It really helps us relax and get ready for the bedtime routine.  I thought the bright colors might be too stimulating on our movie projection (takes up the whole wall) but it actually seems to calm my toddler by the end.

I highly recommend this DVD - but give it a few chances before you decide.",1391817600,,720,4.25
3473246,5,B001AXU1PA,We just love the Praise Baby DVD's.  Wonderfully sung worship and entertaining w/out being over stimulating.  Even if your kids don't sit and watch it it's great to have on in the background during playtime.  And this one is great just before bedtime...a great way to help them wind down from a busy day.,1391731200,,304,4.592592592592593
3473247,5,B001AXU1PA,"This disc has a collection of calming lullabies. The style of the disc is set to pictures just like the other Praise Baby movies. This movie is one of my little ones favorites and it does help her wind down more than other praise baby videos. There are a lot of pictures of sleeping children or babies going to sleep. My little one will start signing 'sleep' and lay herself down.

I highly recommend Praise Baby for infants and toddlers. These videos make great gifts and are fantastic for all children.",1391126400,,504,4.538461538461538
3473248,5,B001AXU1PA,"My kids have loved all the Praise Baby DVDs, but I have to say this was was definitely a favorite. The song ""Jesus Loves Me"" and seeing the lion throughout the DVD made it a hit. I really like that my children are able to learn praise songs and hymns with little effort. It has been such a blessing in our house!",1390262400,,312,4.048387096774194
3473249,3,B001AXU1PA,I own several of the DVD's from the praise baby collection and have been mostly pleased with all. I was a little disappointed with the lullaby edition as the music was too upbeat and the images to stimulating. For reference my child is 13 months and watches a praise baby movie everynight before bedtime as part of or bedtime routine.,1389225600,,334,4.583333333333333

They absolutely love this and despite the fact that they see it everyday, they don't get tired of it. We do change it out with other praise baby dvds, but I bet they have seen this one 20-30 times and still love it! Everytime! Without fail!",1387670400,2,345,3.942857142857143
3473252,5,B001AXU1PA,Love love loved this video for our colicky baby.  My baby cried all the time for his first three months of life and this video instantly calmed him.  We used to watch it every night before bed.  Bonus: Singing along with the hymns helped calm Mom and Dad!  Absolutely recommend!,1386028800,,278,4.5

3473264,5,B001AXU1PA,"My toddler, since infancy, has been a pro at fighting sleep. If he could go pro, he'd be filthy rich!

I searched Amazon for ""lullaby DVD,"" and when I saw the Praise Baby line of DVDs show up in the search results, I knew that would be the one for him. The overwhelmingly positive reviews of this DVD clinched it, since so many before me have also said that it calms their babies. Sure enough, when he asks for ""Big House Kids"" (the production company's logo that appears before the program starts), I pop the disc in, and he then asks me to hold him so he can watch with me. He now is starting to sing along, and frequently will fall asleep in my arms as he's watching it. (Tip: Decrease the volume a couple of steps with each new song.)

Though the adult female vocal track is the default track, I always switch to the child vocal track, which is hauntingly beautiful in the way its sung. Try it in the Music Options menu, and I think you'll agree.

While I liked the sound of the music, I didn't realize that this DVD would become the gateway to my enjoyment of contemporary Christian music! I have family and a friend who have played plenty of it for me, but it was the particular renditions of CCM songs on this disc that made me want to learn more. The opening track, ""Indescribable,"" had lyrics that really got to me, so I quickly saw online that it was from some guy (who is, of course, wildly popular) named Chris Tomlin. I then purchased his ""best of"" compilation album, and the additional lyrics he has in his rendition really struck home. I was hooked. I'm now checking out more of his--and his contemporaries'--music catalogs.

Thanks, Praise Baby!!!",1377907200,2,1663,4.42483660130719
3473265,5,B001AXU1PA,I LOVE all of these in the set!!  My grandbabies have thoroughly enjoyed them and still listen to them as they get older!!!,1374537600,,123,4.3478260869565215
3473266,5,B001AXU1PA,"I am a catholic and while this movie had a nice idea to it... I was not thrilled to receive it as a gift for my second child.  Well... I couldn't have been more wrong.  We came to a sick day where it was raining and it was the only thing that they hadn't seen on the shelf.  I slipped it in and instantly the room was quiet and calm, the kids were entranced by what they are seeing.  We are now on our fourth child and we keep this movie in our car for those difficult moments.  Our older two are eight and seven now and they love to sing along to it.  I am looking now for another one to add to our line-up, we are due with baby number 5 and I can't live without this DVD.  We call it baby crack because every baby that we have ever had, no matter how crazy and worked up they were in the worst tantrum... this DVD has turned them off and made them calm again.  Can't say enough about it.  You do not have to be overly religious to love this DVD.  It is a miracle!!! Highly recommend!",1373155200,,985,3.88
3473267,5,B001AXU1PA,"These DVDs really are a God-send. My almost 3yo is mesmerized by them, and my 8mo is thoroughly calmed by them. This one is particularly nice for those rough middle-of-the-night episodes with the 8mo or for when the 3yo is sick and couch potato-ing.  This was a great addition to the collection.",1372377600,,295,4.673076923076923

I highly recommend this for all kids!",1367884800,,116,3.5
3473269,2,B001AXU1PA,"but I expected something else. I bought this for an 8 month old baby and she loved the case. That was the highlight for her. The music is good, but I could have just played one of my Christian music cds for her since the music was really adult music. I expected something a child would sing...""Jesus Loves Me"" or something like that. I don't have children so maybe I'm just out of the loop. The visuals on this were babies doing active things, but they held no interest for this 8 month old. It may have changed as it got further into the DVD, but I didn't give it a chance since the baby was not paying any attention. Maybe an older child?",1363737600,,640,4.169354838709677
3473270,5,B001AXU1PA,My baby loves these videos. The songs are not the most up to date (this one has one or two that are relatively recent) but they are very well known worship songs and timeless really. He cries when it gets to the credits almost every time.,1362700800,,238,4.195652173913044
3473271,5,B001AXU1PA,"My kids love Praise Baby!  And, I love the soothing music, as well.  Whenever my kids are getting wild or cranky I pop it in and it changes the atmosphere of our home.  All the praise baby movies are pretty similar so I wouldn't worry about which one to buy.  This one is a little more slow and soothing for night time, but not a whole lot different from others.  Best age for these is 6 mo - 2 yrs",1360022400,,398,3.925
3473272,5,B001AXU1PA,"Our grand children have gone to sleep listening to these CD's and had quiet time watching the videos.

The music is sweet and positive and reinforces the truth in scripture.
We have one in of the cd's in our car as well. It is restful even in heavy traffic for my husband!",1356652800,,338,4.2153846153846155
3473273,5,B001AXU1PA,"The music choice is excellent and the images go from lanscape scenic, to babies playing, to babies being held, back to nature scenes (many with animals).

3473277,5,B001AXU1PA,"I put this in the DVD player and instantly our two year old daughter was captivated by the screen and the music.  The music is so very anointed of Jesus; the entire atmosphere of our home was changed and filled with the presence of the Lord.  If you are looking for excellent praise and worship for your littlest ones, this is the way to go - I have tried Baby Faith, it is good...but this is far superior.  I have tried the audio alone on Praise Baby; although wonderful, if you want to have a few minutes to relax with your baby or toddler on the couch before naptime, this is THE way to go because the video is so sweet and engaging.  If you want to try and get a few things done before naptime, it is engaging enough that you can leave your little one watching it in a highchair or pack n play while doing quick chores.  We are very, very pleased and will be collecting all of these DVDs.  Probably not for older children (not over three and a half for sure), but awesome for little ones.  Our daughter likes to name everything in the video and I am sure she will begin to sing the words soon.  Excellent buy.",1320883200,,1113,4.168224299065421

I wanted the same kind of music and picture video but with worship songs.  We just got this and it is AWESOME!  I love the songs and it gets her calm and ready for sleepy times.  Whenever I put it on she sits in her playpen and watches it.

I love that there are three choices to choose from: woman's vocals, kids vocals, and instrumental.  She will watch it with either of the the three.  The actual video is not nearly as nice as Classical Baby but it keeps her interest. I highly reccommend it and will be buying it for some upcoming baby showers.",1315008000,,719,4.274074074074074

3473280,5,B001AXU1PA,We LOVE all of the Praise Baby collection and this one was no different.  I was a little skeptical about the 'sleepytime' part because typically my 10 month old goes crazy with excitement when he watches Praise Baby.  But I have to say that it does have a calming effect on him.  We have started watching 10-15 minutes of the dvd before bath and bed and it really does calm him from being in 'play mode' most of the evening.

The music is a bit chipper at the beginning and then gradually gets softer toward the end. There is some animation, nature scenes and babies going to bed.
