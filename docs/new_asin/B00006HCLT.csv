1758268,5,B00006HCLT,"This cult classic is 25 years old and has never been released in the U.S. on DVD. . . But that is about to change.  Concorde/New Horizons, which is Roger Corman's company, thought enough of this film to make it the first ever acquisition it made for video release back in 1987.  Prior to then, Corman had only distributed his own films.  Unfortunately, they never followed up the VHS release with a DVD, except in Europe, where a third party contractor released a PAL version that was badly chopped up.  The good news: Cedarwood Productions, the original producer has reacquired the rights and will very shortly release the new DVD version of the original film - both the MPAA R-rated and director's uncut version.",1347840000,7,714,4.733870967741935
1758269,5,B00006HCLT,"Bad to the Bone. My favorite serial killer movie. I rented this movie in the '80s, and looked for it for years to purchase, I found out I was looking for a different named movie. I love it. It seems like it is really happening, when you watch it, very beliveable story,I could really see this happening, it also mixes a little humour at times. A MUST SEE.",1323907200,2,355,4.235294117647059
1758270,2,B00006HCLT,"I saw this movie once in 87.  I do remember it quite well.
Why? Because it is disturbing as hell! Burns plays Henry to
the tilt! Looking and even sounding like Henry Lee Lucas.
We start out with Henry giving his confessions to a Officer
about him and his male lover Ottis O'Toole. The movie constantly
flashbacks to Otis and Henry's killings on the freeways of Texas.
Also describes Henry's life in full detail. We also find out
that Henry takes a 12(???) yr.old bride by the name of Becky.
Every thing's fine and all till she gets in a heated argument
with Henry and he stabs her. This is really recommended for
lovers of true life Serial Killer films!  I do not care for these
type of films.  For although I love GORE to death and love films
like cannibal holoCAUST and TEXAS CHAINSAW(74) they are not at all
on any fact! True there times when you have Cannibals and Sociopath's
killing people in real life. But the films I have mentioned are not
real and from some creative gentleman's imagination. This movie is
clearly based on the sick and disturbed Henry Lee Lucas and for me
these are movies I'm just not interested in. Reason why I gave it 2 stars.
It is actually better than 2 stars and I highly suggest it to ones
who are curious about REAL killers! Also recommend Manson Family
Bundy,Dahmer and Monster for those of you who like movies on REAL
killers.  For me I will take HENRY(Michael Rooker) Halloween(78)
Silence of the Lambs,Misery and Deep Red any day over the REAL!",1193184000,,1484,4.485185185185185
1758271,3,B00006HCLT,"Well, yeah, there are some tense moments, but it's just not as good as Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer.  And nobody comes close to Michael Rooker's performance, no matter how good they are -- and this guy's pretty good.  All-in-all a worthy effort but Henry still leads.  Plus, this is a PAL disk, so most people aren't going to be able to see it anyway.",1185062400,2,358,4.378787878787879
1758272,1,B00006HCLT,"DO NOT BUY THIS DISC!

I watched this years ago on VHS and was very impressed.  Owning a multisystem DVD player, I figured I would go ahead and get the PAL version.

The movie is not only severely cut, missing important scenes and lines, but whenever someone curses, the volume goes way down.  Absolutely AWFUL!",1166918400,11,311,4.6
1758273,4,B00006HCLT,"The late, great art director Robert A. Burns (who worked on the original TCM) turns in a perfectly convincing performance as a serial killer. Too bad he didn't do more acting. I'll say this as well: one of the biggest reasons the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre works so well is due to the genius of Robert A. Burns' magnificent art direction.

Director/writer Mark Blair shows tremendous talent here as well. This is another talented filmmaker who is no longer around--and it's a great loss, because this guy, with this one film, puts so many of these ""masters of horror"" directors to

shame.

The only (slight) negative is that the film was shot a bit on the dark side, and you won't find any extras on the DVD, other than a couple of lame trailers for a couple of lame flicks.

More horror fans should know about this one. Even though the gore isn't piled on, you get a more authentic portrait of real life serial killer Henry Lee Lucus than they showed in the John McNaughton version.

Still, both films worked for me.",1153526400,3,1019,4.546448087431694
1758274,4,B00006HCLT,"I had seen this movie on cable many years ago, couldn't forget it, and searched to find it.

No, it doesn't have a succinct (predictable) plot line.  It is the randomness of the murders that is truly cautionary.  A girl hitchhiking, a woman whose car has stalled, a woman with a broken air-condition, and so on.

The scenes are intense.  Generally the women become leery--and their fear is palpable.  They try to extract themselves from the situation but generally fail.

The scene where a girl is attempting to escape through a field had me on the edge of my seat.  As a matter of fact, every scene where I could see a murder coming did.  ""Hollywood"" horror flicks do not affect me so.  I routed for the escape of the victims, but to little or no avail.

In my estimation, the directing was right on as was the acting.  I prefer realism for intensity.

This movie stands on its own.  Why must it follow the book?",1114905600,7,913,4.421686746987952

7968811,5,B00006HCLT,"I'm writing here because I am shocked by the low rating. ...No, actually I'm not shocked at all: Most people are dumb; really-- very dumb.

....
I saw this on cable in the early 90s (when I was still young enough to think TV was worth my time).

This is one of --if not-- the most realistic serial killers stories ever made. (It is that ""Henry: Portrait..."" that is absurdly _fictitious_ Hollywood dreck. Right down to Henry's chivalry.)

---
Note to others: the versions of `Confessions out now are HEAVILY censored. Specifically the rated ""X"" sex scenes are gone. Wasn't porno tho: acting-humping, etc. (Probably because there are kids and underage implications in this.)

The *internet child porn panic* of the late 90s caused laws. Politicos over-reached and possibly swept this up in their drag net.

I wonder if the orig version had to be 'destroyed'. Both Burns (Chainsaw Massacre) and Blair are dead. I.e few who care to fight to preserve it.

If other re-releases are the un-cut original X-rated version I wouldn't know.

The box cover on this release is silly too (Hannibal mask); trying to capitalize on 'Silence.

...Death Of A Movie. Or 'How to Kill a Movie.'

(It should be like a low angle view looking up an interstate, behind Henry's legs (and to the right) as he watches a terrified hitchhiker trying to scurry and claw away in distance. Ie Chainsaw Massacre like; realistic, if not 50s to 70s' pulp ""painterly"".)

PS. I am NOT a horror move buff at all. Don't like em. This one simply stuck.

It has become just a psychological thriller now, after the omission of the sex and murder. But the original had even more effect contributing to this movies' 'stick with you' realism. Specifically Henry's mother's threesome (acting-humping ?!) right in front of little children crying and rapes and necrophilia by Henry (eg the homeowner woman having her air-conditioner repaired). Chilling.

Like chainsaw but far, far more plausible.",1387843200,,1947,4.8844984802431615
