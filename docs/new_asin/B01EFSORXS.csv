7734404,5,B01EFSORXS,Great movie for any age.,1474329600,,24,4.0
7734405,5,B01EFSORXS,"I can't wait!!!! I love the movie, the documentaries that come with the original discs are really fun to watch and fascinating (that poor actor wearing the Ludo costume), can't wait to see the new bits in this new disc, a cleaned up image.

My favorite memory is watching this with my niece who was going through a massive ""that's not fair"" phase. We didn't hear that phrase hardly ever after this. Bog of eternal stench on the other hand.....",1473984000,,443,4.5375
7734406,5,B01EFSORXS,"My daughter is 16 and absolutely loves this movie, I remember going to the movies to see this and listening to the soundtrack in my room. I cant wait to see it fully restored! I am sure we will both enjoy it.",1473033600,4,208,3.9761904761904763
7734407,5,B01EFSORXS,This movie is totally awesome! I have loved this movie since I first saw it years ago. Love David Bowie. Anyone with an imagination can see how wonderful this fantasy movie really is. Stop hating people. If you didn't like this movie then you must have no imagination and I feel sorry for  you.,1469059200,26,294,4.444444444444445
7734408,5,B01EFSORXS,"I adore this movie! I've always loved spooky movies for kids. I only recently (as a pre-teen, if I recall correctly) watched this movie and just fell in love with every aspect of it! And it's celebrating its 30th anniversary! This, with the The Dark Crystal Funko Pop! s, will make a great gift for the spooky kid in your heart!",1464566400,13,328,4.39344262295082
7734409,5,B01EFSORXS,"This is clearly a film that is loved especially by those who saw it first in their childhood in the 80's. To a newcomer, it's bizarre, weird, and a little cheesy. I showed it to a group of teens and a couple of them really loved it but others just kept saying ""What is this??"" But ALL watched it! If you like Neverending Story and Legend, then you're perfect for watching this film. Remember, it's by the guy who created the Muppets, so the quality is there! I highly recommend the soundtrack to this film too. The music is great.",1463529600,34,530,4.31
7734410,1,B01EFSORXS,"This movie is so awful. I cringed when I sat through this on d v d with my wife. She made me watch it. The puppets are annoying, the kids were annoying, and the story was boring garbage ! Now for the best part. Yes, let your kids see David Bowie as a witch , demon or goblin king. His spandex are so tight that his anaconda protruding from his private area is impossible not to notice. I could just hear your kids,""Mommy, is that goblin king smuggling a giant telephone pole in his pants? Daddy, is that why mom wants to see this movie?"" It's really gross folks. Skip this boring pile of dump.",1462579200,7,593,4.165217391304348
7734411,4,B01EFSORXS,"A child is kidnapped, and the only way for his sister to save him is to navigate a bizarre magical labyrinth... and confront the Goblin King.

That's the simple premise behind ""Labyrinth,"" a coming-of-age fantasy set in a very odd fantasy world. It rests partly on the acting talents of David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly, but also on the glorious sets and special effects -- and the sense that we've been thrown into a world where magic is dangerous and wild. At times it's a bit too silly, but the overall effect is a magnificently otherworldly one.

Teenage Sarah (Connelly) loves to lose herself in fantastical daydreams, so she's irritated to be stuck babysitting her crying baby stepbrother. But after she idly wishes that the goblins would steal him... it actually happens. Then the Goblin King Jareth (Bowie) challenges her -- she has only thirteen hours to navigate a hazardous, ever-changing maze. If she fails, her brother will be a goblin himself.

As she rushes through the Labyrinth, Sarah encounters a grumpy dwarf named Hoggle (Brian Henson), a gentle beast, a vulpine knight (David Shaughnessy) and many other bizarre creatures who help and/or hinder her. Jareth himself is trying to sabotage her progress -- but no longer just because of the child. Now he's become fascinated by Sarah, and wants her to be his forever.

""Labyrinth"" was not a commercial success when it was first released, and in fact caused Jim Henson to fall into a depression because he had hoped for better. But it's not hard to see why it became a cult success -- it's a hybrid of ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Alice in Wonderland,"" melding a fantasy quest with a coming-of-age journey. And of course, it has David Bowie as a rock'n'roll goblin. Who couldn't love that?

Henson brought the Labyrinth world to life exquisitely -- it's set in a maze of crumbling walls, with vast statues, guttering candles, weeds and branches, pits filled with talking hands, hedge mazes, swamps, a medieval village and an eerie masque that threatens t bespell Sarah. While much of the setting is earthy and solid, there's still a glittering, eerie sense of dangerous yet beautiful things that might appear out of nowhere.

Perhaps the movie's biggest flaw is its goofy streak -- such as the self-dismembering Fireys -- when it works best as a semi-serious piece. But the writing is excellent, a mixture of sublime prettiness (""Everything I've done, I've done for you. I move the stars for no one"") and goofiness (""Oh don't act so smart. You don't even know what an oubliette is"").

And ""Labyrinth"" wouldn't work at all without the presence of Bowie and Connelly, both of whom give excellent performances. While it's a bit squicky to see a clearly adult Jareth falling for a teenage girl, Bowie is a mass of charisma and cruel elegance, and his wild hair and tight pants give him that rock'n'roll edge. And Connelly has a fresh-faced innocence that makes Sarah seem... well, like a romantic-minded girl who chafes at caring for a weepy baby.

The 30th Anniversary Edition blu-ray is going to have previous editions' extras like commentary by Brian Froud, some ""Journey"" featurettes and a making-of documentary. But there is also a bunch of new material, including a 24-page digibook with photos and extras, an interview with the Mythbusters guys, featurettes, interviews with Jennifer Connelly and the Henson clan, and a new high-def transfer. And since this is the first rerelease since the death of David Bowie, there is also going to be a tribute to him.

""Labyrinth"" is a bit too silly at times, but it also has an unearthly beauty, amazing use of puppets and sets, and two powerful lead performances. Definitely a must-see for the fantasy fan.",1461801600,85,3712,4.87936507936508
7734412,5,B01EFSORXS,"This is my 15 year old's favorite movie.  My 3 year old broke her original disc so I had to get her a replacement.

7734421,5,B01EFSORXS,"It's LABYRINTH!!  It's the BEST Henson movie! (And there are many really good Henson Movies!)  It's very good actors, a great story, and really awesome and creative and great for the WHOLE family.  Lotsa great stuff for kids AND Adults!  Love all the wonderful voice acting.  The puppeting is so good you almost forget there are people behind (or under) them!  Really incredible sets and Bowie and Connelly are very very good together.  LOVE Hoggle, and Ludo.  Some really good themes and always entertaining.
  David Bowie did the music for this and WOW is it great.  THIS VERSION has a lot of GREAT extras about the making of the movie.

7734423,5,B01EFSORXS,"Muppets and Bowie? A match made in heaven. People shook their heads in dismay at the news of this film: would he sink to a kiddie flick? Little did they know how wickedly clever he was: the Goblin King is the gateway drug to David Bowie, the musician. Children raving about this charismatic character were told by their amused parents that David Bowie was a rock star. Curious, the kids would begin to absorb as much as they could understand of his ever-changing personas, and became hooked.
And for an adult woman, his codpiece was an extra source of amusement.",1531180800,,562,4.63

7734456,5,B01EFSORXS,"Good on the folks that run Jim Henson's company for this absolutely stunning remastered edition of Labyrinth. They did such a nice job with the film's restoration that I may safely make the claim this is truly the definitive edition of Labyrinth that you'll want to own. I've seen Labyrinth over 7 times now and I still love it dearly.

Labyrinth endeared itself to me as a child with its fantastic fantasy world, lovingly crafted puppets that are still as fun and mischievous as ever, beautiful score and soundtrack, serious dramatic acting in a kid's movie, and moving coming of age story.

This is not to even mention my childhood crush, Jennifer Connelly, as Labyrinth was her first major film. She's a charming young lady that really grows into her own during Labyrinth. It's really her coming of age story through visual and dialogue based metaphors about maturity, dating, love, fairness, and friendship.

This edition contains not only the Blu-ray of the film made anew with the film restored in full color and sharp image all in high quality, but also a neat little art booklet attached to the inner sleeve that includes notes from Jim Henson, the cast, illustrations and sketches about the creatures as well as a nice summary and explanation of the story's heart and soul. The main menu also boasts special features that show you the whole making of the entire film. It's one of the deepest dives into a film's making as I've ever seen, especially for a children's film. It's so charming to know how much effort and thought went into Labyrinth's music, story, puppets, acting, sets, props, designs, and overall atmosphere.

David Bowie is the charismatic villain Jareth, The Goblin King of the Labyrinth. He eats up the scenery as a magical wizard, playful joker, delightful singer, mysterious watcher, seductive gentleman, and generous granter of wishes. He plays the part to perfection. I do not know a single person that doesn't have Bowie's performance engraved into their mind and heart forever. He symbolizes a rock star and sex icon that is trying to seduce a young girl that will be coming of age soon. In his advances are promises and delights, but Labyrinth teaches young Sarah to stand up on her own. It's all a parable film to allow children to grow up and mature into their own adulthood. Clever metaphorical film-making is not what people expected from visionary director Jim Henson, but it is certainly what he gave us.

Labyrinth is the shining star of children's movies that families everywhere will love. Jim Henson's magical mind bestows fantasy wonders, demonic goblins, and a memorable ball. Watch and enjoy Labyrinth with this Blu-ray Anniversary Edition today!",1520553600,,2693,4.93598233995585

Teenage Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) lives in her own fantasy world and resents having to take care of her younger brother Toby (Toby Froud son of Conceptual Designer Brian Froud.)  She wishes that the Goblin King (David Bowie) who is enamored with her would take Toby away now. Be careful of what you wish for. Toby is whisked off to the goblin King's castle beyond the goblin city and behind a great labyrinth. Now Sarah has just 13 hours to navigate the labyrinth and retrieve Toby if that is what she wants.

We get to travel with Sarah through all over trials and tribulations. We get to kibitz don't go this way don't go that way. And you guessed it Sarah does go this way and Sarah does go that way. In the meantime she learns what friendship and fairness is all about and gains a new respect for her new and old friends.

This is Jennifer Connelly's third film before quitting the industry to go to college. Of course she is back now and a stronger actress than ever.

I've seen this presentation on TV and on VHS. However for some reason I forgot that it was really a musical fantasy even though I knew it had David Bowie. Now with the advent of Blu-Ray I am revisiting all the old films and this one came up on the list. The visuals are spectacular. The voiceover gives you new insights as to what they were trying to do on the movie. Occasionally especially at first it looks like the characters are lip-synching and the sound does not match exactly. Later this is either corrected or you don't notice it anymore.

Now, there is absolutely NOTHING WRONG with this movie, it is just as captivating as ever.  It is one of my all-time favorites.  I have it memorized, I've seen it so often.  That being said, for whatever reason, everything's just how I remember it from the previous editions, except one line.  Boggle says, ""Well, can't be right all the time, can we?""  Unless I missed some other little changes because it's late, I can't help wondering: Why keep absolutely everything else the exact same, but add these two words in?  It doesn't change anything, the movie is still wonderful, and should be watched, I'm only curious.  Does anyone else who got this notice differences like that?  Anyone desperate for deleted scenes?

7734603,5,B01EFSORXS,"I have to admit, I only watched this movie because I'm a HUGE David Bowie fan. And I also admit that I watched the movie after he passed away. Mostly it was because I was desperate for new material from him, but I was also curious. I hadn't watched any of Bowie's other films (including concert films) prior to seeing Labyrinth and I had my childhood years after this movie had been released and largely forgotten about. I was raised with Jim Henson's Muppets rather than his other work.
I was surprised by what I saw when I put the film on, both positively surprised and negatively surprised. It's certainly a movie that isn't without flaws, but it's also one of those movies that shines victoriously despite its flaws. Sure, Jennifer Connelly's acting in this movie is easily the worst acting I've come into contact with in my life. Yes, it's cliche and comes out very forced and unnaturally. Sure, the puppets have moments where they go from groundbreaking ambitious creations to annoying creatures and you wish the movie would mature a little bit but, considering the movie is a children's movie, I suppose that's forgivable. And sure, when I look at Jareth on screen (tight pants and all) I can't not see David Bowie shining through the performance, which kind of ruins the character for me, but that still doesn't take away its charm.
I got the Labyrinth blu ray as part of ""The Brian Froud Art Edition"" collection with The Dark Crystal for $10, so I can easily say I fully got my money's worth from the product. The movie isn't groundbreaking, it doesn't do anything we haven't seen done in the past, and the plot is very standard compared to other movies of its kind, but Labyrinth has an extra sort of charm to it that most of the other generic films don't have. You can't help but get excited as Sara makes her way through the labyrinth to save her baby brother Toby. And when Bowie dances the Magic Dance, who could possibly sit still?",1481846400,,1946,4.578796561604585

7734606,5,B01EFSORXS,"This is one of my favorite '80s movies. I have always liked Jennifer Connelly from this point on. 1986 had few of these type of movies. ""Legend"" comes to mind for another. The casting of David Bowie in the role of the Goblin King is just awesome. I don't think there could have been anyone else in that role in that year for the movie other than him. He did such a great job and the music he did for it was awesome as well. It fits perfectly.

This is a nice Edition!! I am reviewing the one I have, the digibook edition, which is very nice. You can read through it and it has some nice pictures throughout.
The Movie has been nicely done for Bluray and if you can see it in 4K, it is just beautiful!! I have and own a 4K 55"" Ultra HD Vizio. The player I have is a Sony UHD 4K upscaling/3D player. I love it. I can now see this and all my other bluray movies I own in 2160p. Beautiful.

7734630,5,B01EFSORXS,No problems here!,1476748800,,17,5.0
7734631,5,B01EFSORXS,"Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is a fourteen-year-old girl who yearns for a fanciful life away from the responsibilities of caring for her infant stepbrother Toby (Toby Froud). Sarah wishes that the goblins would take him away and she gets exactly what she wishes for. Sarah learns that goblins are very real and so is their King, Jareth (David Bowie), who offers Sarah a chance to win back Toby. All she has to do is reach him in the heart of his Labyrinth.

Puppeteer and Master Storyteller Jim Henson followed up his film The Dark Crystal (1982) with a slightly lighter fantasy called Labyrinth. Collaborating with George Lucas and David Bowie enabled Henson to create one of the great cinematic fantasies of all time. The film is a perfect mixture of music, puppets, and special effects and is now celebrating its 30th birthday.

As is the case with any film that has tons of special effects,  HD releases can be both a blessing and a curse. By placing the film in 4K Ultra HD, several flaws stand out like sore thumbs. Wires are now visible whereas before they simply were not there. Jareths castle floating apart at the end of the film perhaps is the most visible. The high definition aspects also point out how poorly constructed Hoggles head appears to be. Yet in complete contrast to Hoggle, Ludo appears to live and breathe like never before. Likewise for every little goblin that comes to life as it bounces around the screen. Their eyes have souls and true characters behind them.

king jarethThere are so many tiny gems tucked away in the wide shots that are now completely visible that heighten that Alice in Wonderland-like quality the film has always had. Jareths face etched onto a wall in the distance is a perfect tribute to Hensons obsession with details. All of Sarahs belongings in her bedroom are clearly inspirations for the characters inside the Labyrinth. Even Jareth appears on her mirror in a photograph with her deceased mother. Many of these moments and winks to the audience had been lost on DVD and VHS.

Several scenes just never looked right whether it was on DVD or VHS. The Firey dance number with Sarah is such a scene. The shooting of the scene was against black velvet, as to hide each puppeteer (there were three per puppet). This scene now has a yellow glaze on in HD, only highlighting it further. Thankfully, with all the insanity of each dancing puppet they more than make up for it.

Labyrinth

There are several new special features that Sony has collected here for this 30th-anniversary edition. Recording Time: (09:31), is an incredible, albeit short, retrospective look back at Labyrinth. A highlight of this feature is Brian Henson speaking about working with his father for the first time on a motion picture as a seasoned professional. Brian Henson, mentions that his father really enjoyed making The Dark Crystal, but it lacked the fun he had working with The Muppets. After all, for Jim, the best failed takes, were the ones when everyone couldn't stop laughing.

The Henson Legacy Featurette (10:36) is a look at Jim Hensons family, career, and legacy. What fans of Henson will really appreciate, about this piece, is the spotlight on the Center for Puppetry Arts, in Atlanta Georgia. Here they restore and preserve Hensons creations. Many of the creatures from both The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth now reside here.

The Goblin King Featurette (4:48) has Jennifer Connelly and Brian Henson regaling us with tales about David Bowies performance and on set antics. Henson states that Bowie was so relaxed, it was if he was on vacation. He was a joy to both cast mates and the crew. Often Bowie would head to the studio pub after shooting to relax and laugh them.

LabyrinthMany of the other special features are from prior releases. Brian Frouds commentary track is probably unique being that he was the conceptual designer for the film. The must see from the original special features is Inside the Labyrinth. This Making-Of-Documentary is narrated by Jim Henson himself and spotlights screenwriter Terry Jones and conceptual designs by Brain Froud (Tobys real-life father). Immediately one can appreciate the HD transfer again as we see this non-transferred documentary. Grainy and raw it shows its age. What it also reveals is the wizardry and practical thinking in making the creatures of the Labyrinth come to life. David Bowie is also interviewed throughout as many on set moments show exactly how much fun he is having. Star Trek: The Next Generation fans will be shocked to see choreographer Cheryl Gates McFadden break down the Masquerade scene and give goblins directions for the epic battle at the end of the film. This fifty-six-minute documentary (produced by George Lucas) is a must see for fans of Henson and the film.

A great returning special feature is The Storytellers. A picture-in-picture track featuring stories and comments by Cheryl Henson (Hensons daughter), puppet makers Rollin Knewson and Connie Peterson, make-up artist Nick Dudman, and actor Warwick Davis (yes, the man who played Willow). This feature runs the length of the film and covers everything from puppet conception, construction, and then application. Cheryl Henson discusses her father in great length and allows us into what was his inspiration for characters, story and numerous scenes.

For me David Bowie was outstanding as the goblin king outstanding at both acting and singing the songs in this film are brilliant and Jennifer connelly was fantastic as the babysitting sister who wishes her new baby brother gone forever.
This has everything Directed by Jim Henson (Muppets), Produced by George Lucas (Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Willow), Screenplay by Terry Jones (Monty Python) and Music by the legend David Bowie what else would one from a fantasy film.
This 30th anniversary edition has it all plus extras I adore the digital book the disk sits in the back you then have the book section explaining the story behind labyrinth.
How it became the classic it is today information about the film, sets, characters, director, and actors there are interviews from Jennifer connelly and Jim Henson son.
Giving the family's perspective on this classic movie the artwork on the front the back and inside is fantastic for me this is the version to have the Labyrinth 30th Anniversary Digibook bluray version I don't know what extras are on the dvd version but this certainly has everything for me.

Pacedge : Lovely ! It matches  Labyrinth  The Ultimate  Visual  History  very  well.
I loved reading the Q and A section.

Art. Brian Fraud  and Jim Henson  are true  artists  in every  sense  of  the word.
The style  is so creepy  cute!
Story. A modern  fairy  tale  that got better  with age. I heard that when this was originally  released  it flopped  ar the box office .  But it slowly  gained  it's  strength  through  home video  sales and rentals.

Costumes  and makeup . David  Bowie  and Jennifer  Connelly  look so ethereal  especially  in the ballroom  scene .  I honestly  think Sarah ' s princess dress looked better then Princess  Diana ' s wedding  dress.. Jareth  rocked the Gothic  Aristocrat  look way before the Japanese  did!

Acting .  Well done !  I can find no fault .

Musical  score . Trevor  Jones  and David  Bowie  have done  a wonderful  job .

The extras . I don't  own  the other DVD  and Blu  Ray  editions , so I can't  compare .

I saw this movie  on YouTube . It was a really  poor  bootleg  version . But I fell  love  with the movie  and had to get this special  edition . But going  by the reviews on the Gift  set  version  I'm glad  I decided  to get this version  and the Ultimate  Visual  History  book instead .",1474761600,,1260,4.207964601769912
