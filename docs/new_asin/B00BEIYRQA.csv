5589931,2,B00BEIYRQA,"This is an unusual film about a drug deal gone wrong- with tragic consequences.

At the core of the story, it's a cautionary tale about the consequences of greed.

At times, particularly early in the film, I found it to be vaguely reminiscent of Pulp Fiction or even the works of Harold Pinter. However, the promise of excellence is unfulfilled. As the story unfolds, it falters. Ultimately, the storytelling technique resorts to telegraphing the dramatic punches.

It's a pity: there are some scenes - especially early in the movie- which I thought were clever and indeed funny- as black comedy.

The opening scene involving Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz creates an expectation that you are going to see a movie which is challenging and engaging- indeed confronting, particularly as you know the talent involved in the making of the movie.

But, the interesting start is not sustained. As the story progresses, it becomes at times pretentious and even in poor taste (the scene involving Cameron Diaz and the Ferrari, for example). Sadly, the entertainment and engagement level continues to decline as the movie progresses, and it becomes repellent.

Most of the characters are very unsympathetic (Penelope Cruz is an exception), and the story presents a gloomy and nihilistic view of the world.

I suspect the writer sought to present a confronting allegorical tale, but ultimately, it's a tale told in a grim and tiresome fashion.

With all the talent involved in this movie, it is a pity the result was so disappointing. Upon reflection, it reminded me of a quote from Macbeth: 'a tale told... full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'.

5589932,4,B00BEIYRQA,"Michael Fassbender stars in the title role as a lawyer, who as far as I could tell his name was Counselor. He becomes engaged to Lara (Penlope Cruz) who is as pretty as she is naive. Reiner (Javier Bardem) is a rich friend who claims ""Women are an expensive hobby."" His girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) is extremely high maintenance and out of everyone's league. Counselor has a chance to make some big money when he meets a smooth talking, mutual friend, middle man Westray (Brad Pitt) who arranges for Counselor to finance a drug deal. Seems the biggest problem is going to be how to hide the money. Then in the blink of an eye, things go so wrong as now Counselor and Westray try not to star in a Latino snuff film.

The production spends most of the time building up characters with smart dialog. When the twist happens, this changes the film from a clever drama into an action crime drama that needed better action and to last longer. The film seemed to go down hill at the very moment it should have rocketed. It is a well acted film which I enjoyed mostly for the build up. It just didn't bring it home like it should, clearly a weak screen play adaptation.

Worth a view as a rental.

5589933,3,B00BEIYRQA,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

With a cast of Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt and Cameron Diaz, I just had to see this film.  Add one of my favorite directors, Ridley Scott and story teller Cormac McCarthy and this has to be one of the better films of the year, right.  Well, no.  McCarthy hands off his novel but this time, also has responsibility for the screenplay.  Unfortunately he fumbles the ball.

The story is about an unnamed defense attorney, only known as counselor (Fassbender) who gets into debt.  Although it is never really explained, part of it likely comes with the price of a huge diamond ring he buys for his betrothed, Laura (Cruz).  In one scene, which is indicative of the problem of the movie, the counselor is talking to Laura, telling her how much he loves her.  Now I can get into a little love talk, but none of this one way communication is realistic or even interesting, just long winded sappy dialog.  I found myself trying to identify the cool song playing softly in the background (Neil Young?).  Scott and his production team do get the little things right.  In addition to a good soundtrack, the movie looks great.  Both the counselor and the local narcotic kingpin, Reiner (Bardem) have homes to die for.

The counselor, needing some quick cash calls upon a onetime client, Reiner, to hook him up with the transportation of some coke.  He gets in over his head and innocently changes events that allow the cocaine to fall into the hands of a competitor.  Now everyone is in trouble from the Mexican cartel that runs things.  The best thing in the movie is Bardem as the somewhat slimy but fun loving Reiner.  His girlfriend, Malkina (Diaz) is also a piece of work.  The scene where she has sex with Reiner's yellow Ferrari remains, unfortunately, stuck in my head.  But Reiner's play-by-play recounting is hilarious.

Scott and McCarthy clearly had their sights set on ""No Country For Old Men"" neo noir style.  That being McCarthy's novel that later earned some film Oscars, but ultimately fall quite short.",1383091200,2,2084,4.759776536312849
5589934,4,B00BEIYRQA,"""The Counselor"" (2013 release; 117 min.) brings the story of a lawyer (played by Michael Fassbender), whom everyone calls ""counselor"" and whose real name we never learn and who wants to get in on a ""deal"". As the movie opens, we see the counselor and his girlfriend Laura (played by Penelope Cruz) making out in bed before the counselor is flying out to Amsterdam to buy her a large engagement diamond (I suppose the producers don't know that it's not Amsterdam, but nearby Antwerp, Belgium which is the diamond capital of the world). Back in El Paso, TX, we get to know another couple, Reiner (played by Javier Bardem--in real life the husband of Penelope Cruz, incidentally) and Malkina (played by Cameron Diaz), living an extravagant life style. The counselor pleads with Reiner to get in on a ""deal"" (it's never explained exactly what that deal is, other than we can assume it's a drug deal). Reiner introduces the counselor to a middleman named Westray (played by Brad Pitt), who cautions the counselor against it. Meanwhile, in a separate story line we meet Ruth (played by Rosie Perez), who's serving time in prison and her court-appointed lawyer is the counselor. Ruth asks him for a favor, namely to bail out her son, who just got arrested for going 206 MPH on his motorbike. At this point we are not even half-way into the movie. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie was written by noted author Cormac McCarthy, he of such novels as All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and No Country For Old Men, all of which were turned into an interesting, if not successful, movie. If you add that this movie was directed by none other than Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, and last year's Prometheus, just to name those), and you also see the all-star cast attached to this movie, you can't help but have high expectations. Alas, it was not to be. The finer points of the plot are simply impossible to follow, as there are too many characters and subplots, and not enough explanations. But do not despair, there are some real pluses to this movie, none more so than the all-star cast performances. The movie features several Ridley Scott alumni: Michael Fassbender (also in last year's Prometheus) gives a gamely performance in the title role, but even better is Brad Pitt (also in Thelma & Louise) as the slick middleman. This movie has gained some notoriety for the (in)famous car-sex/self-gratifying scene from Cameron Diaz. To be honest, I found it off-putting and about as sexy as watching the grass grow or the paint dry. I will take the far more subtle opening scene with Penelope Cruz over that any day. Really enjoyed Rosie Perez and Bruno Ganz in their small roles. Last but not least, the movie soundtrack (from up-and-coming Daniel Pemberton) is quite good too.

I had seen the trailer for ""The Counselor"" a couple of times, and given the writer-director-all star cast, I was really looking forward to this movie. I went to see it right away when it opened today. The screening I saw this at tonight here in Cincinnati was poorly attend, and that does not bode well for this movie commercially. All that aside, if you go into this with low expectations, I still think it is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1382659200,6,3387,4.700336700336701

5590062,3,B00BEIYRQA,"Whether due to editing room politics or 'overhead', this tragically self-conscious vehicle penned by award-collecting best-seller Cormac McArthy comes across to the bewildered viewer as either a Coppolaesque intrigue of the 'Godfather Part 2' variety, or an overwrought dialogue workshop that suffered from amputation (some might suggest 'decapitation') of most of its context, presumably in the cutting room.

It's amusing seeing the dozen or so stars outshining their characters; eg, Magneto meets Hitler-in-hiding for a diamond appraisal while an intoxicated, gregarious and stupid bizarro-Chigurgh (right down to the Elvis glasses, spray-tan and buffoonish hairdo) spills his guts in his otherwise high security playpen accompanied by scheming mastermind psycho girlfiend Julie ""Lotte"" Gianni and a cast of stock McArthian archetypes guaranteed to remind us of where we are and what world we are gazing upon. Benjamin Button provides the Stranger-level appraisal and loses his head in the process in a way I would have liked to have seen in countless other BP vehicles... I could go on..

I'm not sure whether the fail was caused or compounded by the fact that it wasn't a book first; most of the reviews I have read focus on the emphasis (of which there is much) on dialogue, and blaming the writing, a conjecture which ignores the existence of concepts like narration, point-of-view, and backdrop inherent in McArthy's work (each of them, ironically, are glaringly absent throughout this entire movie leaving the audience to ponder: 'just why the hell should we care?' ). My guess is that the too-loud protests of the 'Unrated Extended Cut"" blurb (right under the title) notwithstanding, I'd bet bitcoin that there is a directors cut out there running somewhere about six hours long in which all of our questions are answered and all our problems are solved. Either that

The last person I want to blame for this is Mr. McArthy himself, although without access to the manuscripts (or even a book version) there is no way to clear him as a suspect, especially considering the almost monolithically talented roster on the performing/production side.

Don't feel bad if you find yourself watching again just to see that stupid haircut and Martinesque bluster, never mind figuring out just what the hell happened. Didacts in place, this movie becomes almost cheetoh-riffic by the end.",1513728000,,2386,5.238219895287958

5590145,5,B00BEIYRQA,"There are many reasons for celebrating this outrageous film. First and foremost due the smart plot of this smart Cormack (The same writer of No country for old men).

I would like to accent this fact, due Cormack makes a vivid dissection about the clash of visions between two well different worlds 8Mexico and USA;  and he like a surgeon, makes a detailed radiography around every character. Even, you might argue this is not the common lexicon you expect from these personages; but this would be irrelevant; the point here is what's behind the witty reflections between Pitt and Fassbender, Fassbender and Bardem, for instance.

The agile and relentless script allowed me to obtain a special satisfaction for watching the slender development of Cameron Diaz's feature (Who made to my mind the role of her lifetime as actress). The sinister complexities, the cruel fatality behind every step you walk and how the visual violence acquires levels of significant importance.

Scott seems to realize that violence has transcended its well know behavior - that somehow begins Triers' The element of crime, The original Old boy or The man who never was (From Coen brothers) think about The trilogy of Winding Refn in The Pusher or God forgives I don't or Drive).

In this sense I invite you to rethink about the new vision of a violence at ts service of a well thought script and not at the contrary.

5590148,5,B00BEIYRQA,"I watched the movie over the weekend and was impressed by it - the script, the filming, the actors all deliver five-star.

I'm surprised by the negative reviews. Reading those, McCarthy and Scott might despair of critics' and the public's comprehension abilities. You read such nonsense, such as McCarthy getting excoriated for scripting a poor Tarentino imitation. Post post-modern man just wants to be entertained, don't you see Mr McCarthy? Don't write about evil unless, like Mr Tarentino, you're willing to glamourize it. Another infuriating review was about Scott indulging in cynicism with the depiction of a cold, merciless universe - as if the deliberate actions of men and women - with a little help of you-know-who, no doubt - weren't responsible for the unspeakable horror that unfolds in the film. A crucial line in the film, in the mouth of Brad Pitt's character, is about a product needing consumers to even exist, first giving the example of snuff movies (a side ""activity"" of drug cartels, as the movie informs us), then the example of drugs themselves, and then asking to ""think about this the next time you do a line of coke"". Such truth-telling doesn't sit well with post post-modern man, who just wants to have his ""fun"" and be left alone, and not have to think too hard about the consequences of his actions. Reviewers also complain about dialogues being ""high-minded""  and sophisticated. Oh, so the drug industry generates more wealth than the car industry, more power than even some heads of state have, and the drug barons are supposed to be morons? Another category of bizarre comments were those along the lines of ""oh, it's so dismal down there in Mexico"", never mind the fact that half of the action happens in the States, never mind the deadly ramifications of the drug trade in the civilized world - the destroyed lives, the hollowed-out neighborhoods and the corruption in the halls of money and power.",1509926400,2,1934,4.91131498470948

The scenes are disjointed. The dialogue is ridiculous, contrived, esoteric in the extreme, ponderous, clumsy...I'm running out of adjectives. Just a joke. Another example (yes, there are others) of a writer thinking because he has had some success with his writing he can do anything. Wrong! And how could Ridley Scott get sucked into such a rotten script? Give me Elmore Leonard's writing any day. McCarthy thinks he some kind of soothsayer / preacher / philosophy-king of the dark and ugly. Wrong!",1506297600,,825,4.816901408450704
5590186,5,B00BEIYRQA,"WARNING: SPOILERS

Despite the many negative reviews, I think The Counselor is an excellent film overall and probably one of Ridley Scotts best films. Cormac McCarthy has written a highly poetic, literary, and philosophic screenplay that explores humanitys heart of darkness: drug trafficking (which relates to arms trafficking and human/sex trafficking), greed, vanity, extreme violence, social Darwinism, survival of the fittest, etc.

Philosophically, the film is extremely dark, perhaps the darkest movie I have ever seen, reminiscent of 8MM, Apocalypse Now, and No Country for Old Men. In this film, the most evil people prevail and the less evil people are hunted and devoured. The counselors fianc&eacute;e, Laura (Penelope Cruz), represents innocence, virtue, and Christian faith and yet she ends up getting abducted, decapitated, raped, and discarded in a landfill. Then the counselor (Michael Fassbender) receives a DVD snuff film starring his fianc&eacute;e.

In contrast, Malkina (Cameron Diaz) represents the strong, ruthless, merciless, manipulative, Darwinian predator. She has cheetah-print tattoos on her back and two pet cheetahs. In her dialogues with Laura and the Catholic priest, she taunts her prey. Even though she sets into motion a plan to steal a Mexican drug cartels shipment of cocaine, which fails, she evades their attention and ends up prospering. In the end, she celebrates her success and concludes the following:

The hunter has grace, beauty, and purity of heart to be found nowhere else. You can make no distinction between what they are and what they do. And what they do is kill. We, of course, are another matter. It is our faintness of heart that has driven us to the edge of ruin. Perhaps you won't agree, but nothing is crueler than a coward. And the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.

In other words, we humans should cease with our faintness of heart and cowardice (e.g. morality and compassion) and embrace social Darwinism and survival of the fittest. The strong should dominate and prey on the weak (e.g. the innocent, virtuous, and faithful). They should embrace their status as predators. After all, in Malkinas view, if you do not embrace social Darwinism, you will just end up being slaughtered by someone who does embrace that worldview and acts effectively. In that sense, for those who are weak-willed or weak-stomached, the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.

Overall, Malkina is a narcissistic, Machiavellian sociopath or psychopath and thus embodies the Dark Triad traits. Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and other leading Nazis also demonstrated these Dark Triad traits, and they often appealed to social Darwinism when trying to justify their war-mongering and their Final Solution: the systematic extermination of 11 million Jews, gypsies, blacks, homosexuals, etc.

However, one should never forget that Hitler and many other leading Nazis came to a bad end (e.g. suicide or the death penalty) and that the Nazis absolutely failed to achieve their ultimate objectives: defeat communism, conquer the entire continent of Europe (including Britain), and create a thousand-year Reich (German empire). In the long term, the Nazis sabotaged and destroyed themselves. Similarly, quite often, Machiavellian sociopaths or psychopaths like Malkina (or the high-level cartel members) end up destroying themselves or being destroyed (i.e. murdered). Arguably, this shows that extreme social Darwinism, sociopathy, and psychopathy are unsustainable, counterproductive, and self-defeating in the long term. Contrary to the film, evil or at least evil individuals do not prevail in the long term. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.

In conclusion, I consider The Counselor an excellent, literary, philosophic film with very dark themes. If you are seriously depressed or having mental health issues, I strongly recommend that you avoid this film. It can be difficult to digest even if you are a mature, mentally sound adult. Figuratively, it punches you in the gut. As Westray (Brad Pitt) says, I've pretty much seen it all, Counselor, and it's all s***.",1504828800,3,4202,5.375379939209727

my amazon review of a sickeningly wonderful movie- Ridley Scott's ""The Counselor""
Don't show this one to yr kids.
I usually give movies I love one star- because I know how negative people are- like this movie. A more concentrated collection of sleeze balls I have not seen in a movie- this one takes the cake for evil- especially the killing lust heroine of Malkina. Is there any ONE good person in the film? Cruz maybe? (but then she falls for the counselor-0 himself - like so many lawyers- shall we say , um ""challenged"".And she is a dupe. Even the lovable looking Brad Pitt is a horror (and aren't we glad to see him bleeding to death with his carotid artery sliced and spurting?!) Be honest now.
These talented actors reminded me of trump an d his cabinet (altho trump may be worse in the number of corpses that result in the nxt 4 years. I'd like to see trump's supporters in a barrel like the campesino in the movie. They also are slimy.
Cormac McCarthy's script is ever beguiling- like a cobra! The description of the cartel making a snuff film expecially sickening. DePalma knows how to push buttons- as does MCarthy.
Like many great new movies- this is hard to follow until one reads the wikipedia acccount- who is who, etc.
Particularly hideous means of death always enthrall (winess Poe) as de Palma knows.
One person told me they did not like Cameron Diaz' performance- but I had the thought that - as the evil person she is- if she is in reality a dummie- she is like evil persons- like Mengele.
How did she get Cruz's diamond?
W her cheetahs she is a fabulous Dr of Death- (Pace Chester the Cheeta of Frito Lay).
A wonderfl movie to sicken the most jaded.
Who comes up w this stuff? (snuff?)

5590190,4,B00BEIYRQA,"After reading all of the negative reviews of this film, you'd think that Cormac and Ridley just fell off the turnip truck. Seriously, these are two of the greatest artists of the last half-century. The great Cormac McCarthy can't write a screenplay, really? And Ridley Scott suddenly forgot everything he learned about directing in the previous 40 years?

This is a deep movie with serious but accessible thematic elements: caution, heroism, love, greed, ethics, fidelity and death. There IS a plot (perfectly linear, no jumping around the timeline, flashbacks, etc.) and it isn't difficult to follow with a bit of attention and imagination.

Having said that (and having only seen this extended cut) I can imagine how a version that was even 15 minutes shorter would lead to some head scratching. Every scene feels necessary, nothing is superfluous.

One other issue that people may face is that the antagonists are never shown. We see low-level mechanics, people who are simply operating on orders from above, but the big players of the cartels are never pictured. There is one ""El Jefe"" in the film, the revelation of whom comes very late, and very surprising.

I think most people's difficulty with this film is that it is very deliberately paced, this unraveling of The Counselor's life. There is dialogue aplenty, very lyrical, the kind of carefully chosen words that are spoken when circumstances are deadly serious. This is not another superhero flick with lots of quick cuts and things blowing up in spectacular CG. Beautifully filmed and acted, this is serious, meditative work of cinema, a bit gruesome at times, but certainly one I will revisit in the future.",1496275200,6,1671,5.021660649819495

I was honestly expecting the whole plot to eventually tie up the loose ends but that never happened.

Cormac McCarthy wrote the script, who is the greatest American author since Steinbeck and Hemingway. If you think it is involuted and complex, you are simply dumb. Read some high quality fiction and raise your I.Q. Second, Diaz is outstanding. With this and ""Vanilla Sky"", she owns the psycopathic and sadistic landscape of cinema. This Was an Oscar worthy performance. Third, this movie also offers some fantastic acting by Javier B., Brad Pitt, Penelope Cruz, Michael Fassbender, and the venerable R. Blades. What is wrong: Javier's hair (someone thought he needed to look more like a drug dealer), some confusion about who is representing who, and Cruz, whom I alway see as beautiful and vulnerable, but is never quite able to tap into the terrific talent that seems just below the surface. Otherwise, this is a film that is a Tragedy, in the finest sense of Shakespeare. There are people, here, who set out on the trek to find their Utopia only to be swept up in overwhelming sorrow and destruction due to their own greed and weakness,.",1461974400,2,1138,4.781725888324873
5590531,5,B00BEIYRQA,"This is the most important film for the 21st Century. I absolutely love it. It functions like a Faustian play, a grim prophesy of humanity's future. The story is one we have all seen before. Man gets involved with dealing drugs, and he is not prepared for the consequences. The drug deal goes very bad. That is the story. It is a simple and familiar story. But the presentation is the beauty. The horrific themes and imagery. The dark worldview that transforms this standard plot into a brilliant nightmare. Above all, it is a condemnation of modern culture, where man is divorced from the realities of his actions, because Nature (both ecological and human) is treated as an externality. Yes, the dialogue is philosophical and ""over-the-top."" It functions very much like a Shakespearian play (and pulls it off). This is Scott's best film, and an amazing script by McCarthy. It is a beautiful work of art, and deserves multiple views. The acting is outstanding. Brad Pitt is tragically self-aware. Cameron Diaz gives the performance of her career.

5590574,3,B00BEIYRQA,"I had high hopes for this film, mostly because McCarthy wrote the script. My only comment about his involvement at this point would be ""Stick to books"".

Having watched thousands of movies in my lifetime, I feel that I'm usually pretty savvy at picking up what the plot is and figuring out a couple of possibilities of where it might lead. Not so on this one. It didn't actually reveal itself for about 30 minutes. That's a pretty long stall-time, even for the most patient of film-goers. Knowing adhead of time that McCarthy creates things that are usually pretty dark (and getting darker in his dotage, it seems) I wasn't shocked by the violence or sex. Where it seems to serve a purpose in ""No Country for Old Men"", here it seems pointless, gory window dressing to the main event. Tons of story holes and convenient script fixes, which surprised me because McCarthy is usually pretty good at making things seem plausible.

Cast was good, acting was good, cinematography was fair (shaky-style camera is really starting to get old but it's sprinkled in lightly). But the story is what makes a film, and though he's one of my favorite writers, this McCarthy work felt dark and hopeless without any real lesson to be learned.",1457395200,,1224,4.714953271028038

Would have been awkward at the very least. Pene is in love with Mike Fass and Javier has this thing going on with Cameron! This couple (Pene and Javier) must be the consummate professionals.
Always liked Ridley Scott's movies and I am almost forced to like this movie. The movie is definitely stylishly shot and the blu rau is suberb.

5590612,4,B00BEIYRQA,"""The Counselor""  is a story about a likable guy, a well-to-do lawyer, who, in his greediness, despite a few warnings against investing in an illegal drug trade, decides to do so, and, in a nutshell, it destroys him and everything he loves. By the end, there is no hope--only pain. Firstly, there is a superb cast and the film is well acted by the actors, some being Academy Award winners, who include Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, and Brad Pitt. The actor who is unusually placed into this film is Cameron Diaz, but her quality in this movie is equal to any of the other big-name actors here. At the same time that the main character decides to invest in the drug trade, another person is bringing down people in that trade with violence and thievery, and often with gruesome murder. But, the story's lawyer-protagonist does not know this until he's caught into it and unable to escape. And, it costs him everything dear. Secondly, Author Cormac McCarthy's dialogue, as other people have commented, is extremely good, despite that this movie represents the writer's first screenplay, though his other work, 'No Country for Old Men,' is the basis for the film with the same name to have received its year's Oscar for Best Film, a big hit with critics. 'The Counselor' accomplishes unconventional things that other films would not even try, including the film's opening sex scene that seems pure and simultaneously much more frank and down-to-earth than other movies, articulating a much more honest version of the reality of what people know, removing the prudish cliches. And, the movie's longer version available on this Bluray edition has a lot more dialogue fleshing out the screenplay, and this is even better than the theatrical release to the more patient viewer. Films ending with a protagonist losing everything is not a new concept in the history of cinema, considering the art and style of film noir. 'The Counselor' is that type of film, with a Hitchcock-like view of psychology. Audiences expecting this film to make them feel good would be disappointed. And, some viewers have been upset by their limitations for this very reason. The interesting quality in this movie is that there is so much style and competence apparent with this film than another director would hope to obtain. Ridley Scott is a thinking person's director, and financiers trust him to make films with much more of their money than they do other directors today. They respect that this director makes good movies with their money, that he has since the late 1970s been making high-quality features, without repeating himself. And, he brings a lot of prestige to discriminating viewers who know cinema and his place in the world.",1454025600,2,2746,4.9437229437229435

5590843,2,B00BEIYRQA,"Credit where credit is due -- if you are going to act in a farce (I'm referring to the genre), then you must never, even at the silliest moments, seem to be tipping off your audience that you're aware that you're in a certain kind of play.  The humor depends on the actors seeming to be dead serious, even when, to the audience, the events on stage are at their silliest or most outrageous.  So the actors in ""The Counselor"" deserve a lot of credit.  They play it dead straight.  So, you might ask -- are you saying that this movie is, generically, a farce?  I am saying that, for if it isn't, it's a total mess.  But there's reason to think that Cormac McCarthy, who wrote the screenplay, and the director Ridley Scott knew exactly what they were doing.  Any screenplay for what looks like a ""thriller"" that alludes to the death of Socrates and Christopher Marlowe's ""The Jew of Malta"" (and probably some other things I've missed) obviously has something going on, and the nearest analogue I can find to the kind of drama this is is the hyper-sensationalized early 17th-Century morality plays that used to be referred to as ""Jacobean Tragedy"" and that were associated with names like Cyril Tourneur and John Webster.  Marlowe's ""Jew of Malta"" might be thought of as a kind of prototype of such drama, and elements of it can be found in Shakespeare's tragedies -- obviously in ""Titus Andronicus,"" and maybe less obviously in ""King Lear"" and ""Macbeth.""  The 17 Century critic Thomas Rhymer referred to ""Othello"" as ""a bloody farce,"" and that's not a bad description of ""The Counselor"" too, as long as we remember that heavy-handed moralism goes along with it.

The mixture of power, greed, and sex, along with characters who think they can control events after having made some very sketchy decisions -- it's all there, just as it was in the Jacobean predecessors.  You might be tempted to think of it as a kind of ""film noir,"" because there is in this film also a sense of its characters becoming more and more entrapped, the atmosphere becoming more claustrophobic.  But in a ""noir,"" entrapment and claustrophobia are expressed through visual style.  Here the visual style is much more realist, and it's in the dialogue that the sense of entrapment and ever-more-limited choices comes across.  It does so because the characters talk all the time about choices and consequences.  Westray (Brad Pitt) advises the counselor (Michael Fassbender) not to get ""in"" to the drug deal that Reiner (Javier Bardem) is involved with.  Even Reiner is cautioning the counselor -- don't get in.  But the counselor (who, for reasons that aren't explicit, needs money) thinks he CAN get in, just this once, pick up his share of $20 million, and get out again.  It's not accidental that people lose their heads in this movie -- for when greed, power, and sex get to work, clear thinking goes out the window, so losing one's head seems an apt trope, all things considered.

Once you're in, getting out is difficult, especially when, to bring off the deal, you have to run afoul of ""the cartel.""  Let's just say that the Borgias, as popularly imagined, have nothing on the cartel.  Of the characters who are willing to take their chances, only the coolest can have a chance at success.  In this case, that's Marika (Cameron Diaz), and it helps that she lacks a soul and is willing to do whatever it takes with her body.  At the end of the movie, she's still on the playing field, so to speak, though whether she will ultimately prevail is an open question.  Suffice it to say here that thieves have fallen out, and some of the mayhem in the movie derives from that fact and not just the cartel.  But what might strike you most about the movie -- and all the characters are unlikeable -- is the talk.  Everybody's a kind of pseudo-philosopher, and on and on they go about choices, consequences, freedom, guilt, weaknesses.  In case you don't get the point, think about the scene in which Cameron Diaz tries to get a priest to listen to her confession.  It's rare to find such hyper-articulateness yoked to a modern ""thriller"" plot, and it's one of the features that clues the audience to the kind of farce that this is.  I think that the movie is exactly what Scott and McCarthy had in mind, and clearly a bunch of very talented actors are all on board.  One could even say that it's very good of its kind -- but I don't much like the kind.  I haven't been tempted to re-read ""The White Devil"" or ""The Revenger's Tragedy,"" and I doubt that I'll be revisiting this -- although there is that scene of Cameron Diaz having sex with an expensive car . . .",1439337600,,4629,4.601705237515225

While not the worst movie in history The Counselor does little to polish the resumes of its cast and crew. Instead, what you have is a pretentious and wordy film with virtually no suspense or sense of pacing.  Add to that a central character (a supposed worldly and successful litigator) who spends 99% of the movie wondering 1) how this criminal enterprise works, 2) how did he get in so much trouble, and 3) can the vicious drug lords help him get out of his predicament because he's basically a good guy who made a very bad mistake.

I mean, really?

Not content with wordy excursions into dead plot-land, there are 2-3 sex-type (I say sex-type because a few involve sex acts while others involve talking (incessantly) about sex acts)  scenes that not only don't move the story along but are inexplicably boring. Case in point is the scene where Cameron Diaz gymnastically humps a car windshield, where you wonder afterwards ""why the heck was that thrown in?"" And the character played by Javier Bardem is a worthless, sex-addled drug lord wannabe with no redeeming value.

Chock full of unsympathetic characters (save the leopards) and a story that goes nowhere fast, The Counselor is a wasted opportunity of gigantic proportions.  One and a half stars for some decent acting.",1438560000,,1452,4.854251012145749

5590936,2,B00BEIYRQA,"The Counselor
 We waited to see The Counselor with excitement in our little eyes.  The anticipation turned out to be the best part of the movie.  What a shame.  Novelist Corman McCarthy wrote the book that No Country for Old Men came from.  He did the screenplay for The Counselor.  Forgive us for expecting something astonishing.  Well, actually we did get something astonishing.  We would rather have had a watchable movie.
 McCarthy has brought forth a script with plenty of curves, twists and leaps of imagination.  Sadly, it also contains lengthily soliloquies by several of the actors on the nature of women, the inevitability of death and the crushing consequences of ones actions.  Perhaps this sort of thing makes good reading in a novel.  In a movie we want action.  We expect the moral lessons which elevate a good movie into an excellent movie to be made plain by the actions of the protagonists.  We call films movies for a reason, the very term talkies has an antique resonance to our ears.
 The truly excellent cast and the world class director, Riddley Scott, are not to be blamed, at least not after their initial mistake of signing on to the project.  Scotts taught directing and grand staging are up to his usual high standards.
 We have a wonderful cast, even when they must recite a mouth full of something that should have been shown with a camera shot or a pithy bullet point.  Javier Bardem also appeared in No Country for Old Men to his lasting artistic credit.  Here he plays a flamboyant drug dealer.  Cameron Diez is his even more flamboyant girlfriend.  She has hunting leopards and matching leopard tattoos.  Thats style.  Other actors include Michael Fassbender in the title role and his wife Penelope Cruz.  Brad Pitt rounds out the major players.  We accept this wealth of actors in an ensemble film.  A danger in this kind of film can occur when each of the ensemble actors get equal time.  When that happens, each character becomes equally bereft of the time it takes to develop each individual character.  In The Counselor McCarthy gives us half formed characters that dazzle us but who we find incomplete and unsatisfying.
 We do find the depth of the actors bench to be dazzling.  Besides the major roles we have Rosie Perez, Natalie Dormer, Latin actor/singer Ruben Blades and John Leguizamo filling in roles that would usually be filled by actor number three from the casting call.  I liked that.
 Producers Scott and McCarthy held down the budget to a tiny $25 million.  The R rated (varied exotic erotica, murder simultaneously harsh and casual), two saw blade film brought in a meager $8 million opening weekend.  The winner of the weekend was Bad Grandpa, a series of gross set ups with an old dude and a little kid.  Maybe the people got it right.",1436832000,2,2792,4.733887733887734

5590943,5,B00BEIYRQA,"I purchased this film some time ago and was left cold and confused after the initial viewing. I am typically enthusiastic over any Scott Free effort and was excited to see what Scott could do with Cormac. So today I gave the film the attention it deserves actually viewing it twice to cement some of the dialogue and philosophy in my mind. This is one of those films that requires FULL and intense attention to engage the mind in an internal debate.

When the Sephardic Jewish diamond merchant in Amsterdam discusses the heritage of the only surviving ""culture"" where the One GOD has been ""purloined"" by the dominant religion while expounding on the critical mindset of those who only speak of diamonds in terms of their imperfections with a lawyer who has made a choice of ultimate destruction you know you've been introduced to something rarely mixed with 200 MPH rice burners, septic sewage trucks,, and on screen beheadings with piano wire ( on the rice burner and in the financial district of London). This kind of mixture is very rare and difficult to consume in comfort.

I can understand why so many one star reviews exist here. This is not an easy film to watch despite the accomplished cast, author and director. This film is EXTREME - from the dense intelligent dialogue and amazing philosophical soliloquies to the headless bodies, gushing arteries, religious overtones, ostentatious wealth, pet hunting cheetahs and Brazilian waxed Ferrari windscreens - there is something here to offend everyone.

This film even reprises the juxtaposition of Cameron Diaz with Penelope Cruz ala Vanilla Sky with Cruz as the sexually dynamic ""church lady"" and Diaz as the ultimate destructive element. Their performances of these characters has matured into perfection only to be matched by the brief but eloquent summation by Ruben Blades as he patiently describes the utter damnation facing ""The Counselor"" who finds himself pinned to the same cross found by William Hurt in Body Heat made much worse by the knowledge that his mistake led to the prolonged and tortured death of his beloved.",1435190400,,2089,4.979942693409742

5591010,5,B00BEIYRQA,"The Counselor is one of those criminally misunderstood films that suffered from a devastating consensus of unflattering reviews from critics and subsequently audiences upon its release. The ""stank"" of this nearly universal hate-slide has relegated the film to the deepest vacuole of the landfill heap. To go against a consensus of this magnitude, especially as a professional film critic or blogger, would be to risk getting that ""stank"" on one's reputation, thus it is much easier to be complacent in condemning universally panned art that defies measurement by the calibrated scales of a defined style. The rare positive reviews of The Counselor that did exist at the time were resounding with praise and thus a small contingency of fans emerged with their equally subjective interpretation of what they, in seeing the same film, determined as much different from the consensus. In my opinion The Counselor deserves a reprieve from its initial reception as it was condemned immediately and without a chance to fully bloom. The impact of the film on me after seeing a showing at the local theater was of bafflement mostly due to the disservice of the trailer which I will get too shortly. It took some time to digest The Counselor afterwards much like it had with the similarly misunderstood Only God Forgives. With time my affinity towards both of these movies grew greater and greater. Spiritual and Philosophical undertones emerged from what I perceived as intentionally vague or abstract sockets carved meticulously from the plot by the deft hand of McCarthy and Scott and respectively in the case of Only God Forgives Nicolas Winding Refn. Misconstrued as ""plotholes"", these ambiguities offer mystique that lingers after the film has ended. It also brings an authenticity to the story that explanation diminishes. McCormick McCarthy's dialogue is as rich and penetrating as it is in his novels but tossed off in conversation instead of read in print is challenging. For me repeated viewings of The Counselor has aided in fully absorbing the dialogue's beauty and terror. Also much like McCarthy's novels he rewards just as much with what is not on display as with what is viscerally depicted by Director Ridley Scott. Scott at 71, remains as relevant a director in my opinion as someone half his age, paying no mind hopefully to the negative criticism both The Counselor and his other polarizing film of recent years, Prometheus, have received. He has shown, especially with The Counselor, that he is not interested in spoon feeding audiences, pandering to expectations or operating within the confines of traditional cinematic storytelling. The studio is less enthusiastic about breaking the rules, thus a misleading trailer promoted the film as a quirky action crime thriller instead of the savage nihilistic noir it happened to be. It got audiences interested but betrayed the film ultimately. Tricking audiences into a false notion of what they will be getting is only going to lead to an angry audience and this is exactly what happened to The Counselor. The trailer mislead its audience, lied to them, outright, and the film was punished for that marketing trickery. The Counselor is a patchwork of events that require some interaction of intellect and imagination by the audience to assemble which for one out of ten moviegoers will not be enjoyable. But for that one, The Counselor has a lot to chew on. It leads the viewer into a hopeless abyss, throws them out the car while it is still moving and leaves them to waddle in the absurdity of existence. Immediate disorientation occurs and instant gratification is denied, unless possessed by its poetic qualities enough to unravel its dark beauty for contemplation. There is a terror in The Counselor that is truly remarkable but is not outright seen but rather felt upon examination of all its parts. I don't want to infer that anybody that disliked The Counselor simply did not understand it but the more one participates in the experience the more one is able to appreciate its brilliance. Like Only God Forgives, The Counselor also operates in a sort of dream state, indulges in violence, employs a protagonist that is more of a simulacrum than an identity, has a vivid and over-the-top female antagonist, consistently administers jolts of shocking and lush imagery and both were released in 2013. They may have made some ""worst of the year"" lists that year but I do believe with the passing of time that both films will develop a following and endure as cult classics. The Counselor, in short, is the perfect embodiment of the mysterious final pontification of Tommy Lee Jones in No Country For Old Men.",1432425600,2,4672,5.029677419354838

The wire that ended the Green Hornet was constructed way too early in the day for us to believe that not one other vehicle traveled on that road in either direction prior to the event. When Cruz and Pitt were on the run, why didn't they disguise themselves? Why didn't Cruz call for a limo or at least valet parking so that she wouldnt be alone at the airport? Why didn't Pitt cut his hair or shave his head or for that matter travel to a less public town than London and for once take off that silly western getup so that he wouldn't stand out like a tomato in a basket of lemons. Bardem seemed too exposed when he knew full well he was a marked man. Where were his body guards? Fassbender came off as a very weak protagonist mostly due to not using his legal skills to combat the cartel. If we are to believe that these people had the wherewithal to elevate themselves in the drug trade then why were they not able to demonstrate that cunning when their lives were on the line? At least disguise themselves, go into hiding or make a legitimate effort to defend themselves. As it played out Cruz, Pitt, Bardem, and Fassbender appeared to be sitting ducks in a shooting gallery. Im not saying the main plot should have been different but at least give the cartel some challenges to get at these people. I loved McCarthys No Country for Old Men and it seems to me that The Counselor sure could have used someone with gumption like Josh Brolins character. At least he was a protagonist I rooted for. In The Counselor I had no warm feelings for any of the characters. I could care less what happened to them. And unlike No Country for Old Men there was no antagonist that you grew to hate just a random assortment of nameless thugs spread throughout the movie.",1430870400,7,1892,4.377840909090909

Poor Cameron Diaz. She used to be so sexy (annoying, but sexy.) I hope it was just the make-up, but she has really lost it. No acting to fall back on either. Penelope Cruz is as cute as ever.

5591266,4,B00BEIYRQA,"It's not often I award 4 stars to a movie I didn't understand, but the Counselor is one of those examples.  Cameron Diaz basically flaunts her stuff in really dirty (but admittedly hilarious) ways, and overall is just a naughty girl.  She even looks much older and worn out than she really is.  Penelope Cruz is a beauty that you want to sympathize with due to um, without spoiling anything, something happens to her later on (and shortly after that another thing happens).  All the male actors including the Billy Ray Cyrus lookalike Brad Pitt are phenomenal in their roles, and Brad in particular feels the unpleasantness of an erupting blood-squirting throat on the city streets.  Not sure at all what just happened there.

The pace of the film is incredibly slow-moving for at least the first hour.  It's not even a 2-hour movie so yeah, the Counselor is unquestionably a slow one.  The storyline being quite confusing benefits from having actors and actresses who are top-notch in their performances.  When the inevitable decapitations, gun shootings and car chases kick in, the movie isn't shy in being really bloody and violent either.  Dare I say the atmosphere even builds to these extreme moments really well.  Michael Fassbender showing a ton of compassion and emotion for his fianc (Penelope's character) and desiring to exchange his life for hers during a memorable phone conversation is an outstanding and noteworthy acting performance too.

Come to think of it, this might be the first film I ever watched Brad Pitt star in.  Seriously.  He's not one of my favorite actors at all.  He obviously relies more on his looks (that ALL the women find a hunk- believe me, I haven't met a single woman who *didn't* think he was incredibly hot) and this sort of rubs off on me and the way I perceive his character in films.  It's why I usually avoid films that star Brad Pitt, however admittedly he does a pretty good job here.

Everything about the Counselor is great... except of course, the slow movement of the storyline and the hard to understand storyline.  Basically someone betrays someone else and now one of them has to pay for it (whoever the good and bad guys are- it's impossible to know).  The Counselor is a good movie that the patient viewers will understand more so than the ones who can't grasp things right away *holds hand up*  ""Me me!""  So with that in mind, the Counselor is an acquired taste.",1422748800,2,2421,4.730310262529833
5591267,5,B00BEIYRQA,"Wow!  This movie really divides an audience.

Last month, I happened upon the jeweler scene on pay cable.  Talking about an expensive diamond the Counselor is considering as an engagement ring, the jeweler says, ""To enhance the beauty of the beloved is to acknowledge both her frailty and the nobility of that frailty.  At our noblest we announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives.  That we will not thereby be made less.""  This deft kaleidoscope of a metaphor riveted me. Did he really say that? I played it back and even read the subtitles. A film that dares to have a character speak such a rarefied line of poetry like that is one I definitely had to see in its full expanded and unrated mode.  I immediately turned off the TV and ordered both the screenplay and the extended-cut Blu Ray.

I only wish more films had such scenes of existentially aware and wise dialogue.  Yes, it is heightened, stylized, and assuredly not ""every day speaking"", but it's the simpering drudge of ""every day"" speaking (even in our own fidgeting minds) that clouds the skies of all our days.  Many Amazon reviewers are angry and damning of this film's dialogue, but what is so aesthetically wrong with having provocative and profound speeches in a thriller? (The public sure loved it from Dr. Lechter in the Hannibal series.)  Perhaps it is the genre expectations of a typical thriller -- terse and to-the-point dialogue -- that disappoints so many viewers when ""The Counselor"" winds up being Eugene O'Neill with beheadings.

While full of metaphor and poetry from many characters, the dialogue has purpose.  It provides philosophical and psychological perspectives for such cruelties as the Bolito beheading or the revelation of Diaz character's psychopathology.  The main characters, with the exception of Laura, are people who have willed themselves off the grid of middle-class morality into greed, murder, and mayhem; yet they are intelligent and self-aware.  Let's see how they think through their worlds.

The plot is as elegantly constructed and understated as the dialogue is rich and poetic.  This is a movie to experience, not merely watch.  (The fact that it is probably one of the most damning anti-drug films I've ever seen is just a footnote to all of the other treasures of theme, character, and dialogue ""The Counselor"" provides.)

Here's hoping that time provides the measure through which the unrated version of this film will grow in stature to a future audience unafraid of an artistic search for truth.  Whether that audience materializes or not, the extended version of ""The Counselor"" is a robust achievement of cinema.",1422576000,9,2668,4.952808988764045
5591268,1,B00BEIYRQA,Awful movie made worse by incredibly horrible acting from Cameron Diaz.,1422489600,,71,5.545454545454546
5591269,5,B00BEIYRQA,"I was appalled by the evil being presented to me in this film.  It was as if the hideous Bardem villain in ""No Country for Old Men"" (also from Cormack McCarthy's writings) had become legion.  Here is a whole population of frightening psychopaths with no compunction about subjecting others to violence and cruelty.  Despite all of this, I was riveted to the screen throughout.  I felt that McCarthy had somehow delved into the evil world of the drug cartels to an extent where he could make you experience, unusually deeply, how terrifying their evil really is.  Now I am one who is always fonder of character-driven movies, with brilliant dialogue, leaving one with much to think about when the lights come up at the finish.  I wasn't especially keen to experience action, thrills, or suspense.  The lengthy verbal scenes toward the close of the film might well strike many a modern young viewer as somewhat static and, perhaps, difficult to comprehend, but I was with them all the way.  I have seldom heard such articulate expressions of profound psychological and disturbing philosophical issues in a movie, and it worked for me.  I have seen many reviews by others who, clearly did not feel this way about the film.  Seeing the kinds of movies that are most successful these days, I can hardly be surprised; however, for anyone who wants to experience a deeply thoughtful, unflinching exploration of some of the very darkest aspects of today's world, I heartily recommend this movie.  Everyone should be strongly warned that many of the sexual matters, as well as some of the violence are very shocking indeed; at least they were to me.",1422230400,22,1640,4.842293906810036

I guess you'd say this movie was driven more by dialogue and characters than by plot. Which would be okay if the dialogue was good or the characters were believable (or at all likeable) but that wasn't the case.
I thought the dialogue was kind of pretentious and sloppy. One example is that throughout the movie, various characters seem to lecture other characters on universal truths. But it's kind of annoying because none of the characters has any credibility. I don't believe in any of the characters or in what they say.

5591463,1,B00BEIYRQA,"SPOILERS
I wanted to like this finely casted movie, but it had so many glaringly awful, unrealistic, characters, that it felt more like a sophisticated cartoon than a Movie. Much like ""High Noon"" the course of the picture is set early on and it's obvious to all where things are headed. Fassbender (the Counselor) and his two partners played by Pitt (Westray) and Bardem (Reiner) commit a crime of smuggling a large shipment of drugs over the US southern border by way of a Mexican Drug Cartel. Another group moves in and steals the shipment, which mounts the Cartel looking for The Counselor, Westray, and Reiner. Westray and Reiner have made money this way before and realize how dire the situation is. Both of them advise the Counselor that there is no winning conclusion for any of them, and so the remainder of the film consists of the outcome of the Cartel exacting revenge on the three and in small batches of what happened to the drug shipment. The story written by Cormac McCarthy is typical of his writing style, which holds back very little in the horrific world of crime. So, why do I dislike this movie so much? Well, it starts out well, Fassbender as The Counselor is a successful Lawyer that needs some money and is willing to take the risk and invest in the crime with his associates Westray (Pitt) and Reiner (Bardem). One would assume that the successful Counselor, whom the picture is named after is smart or clever in some way and I kept waiting for something interesting to take place as his world gets darker and darker. (SPOILER) His character is so unreal for his occupation that we must now assume he is called The Counselor because he works at a Summer Camp watching little children play sports. As his wife played by Cruz learns the hard; after learning that they may be collected by the Cartel he suggests they MEET AT A HOTEL. Should I continue? Should I elaborate as to what anyone trained in law would suggest to his loved one when pressed with such horrible threat? Perhaps there are safer alternatives that anyone may know of? My four year old could only think of ten safer places, of course he's not a Lawyer. Anyway the story is over for them. Reiner played wonderfully by Bardem claims he understands the gravity of the situation, but does nothing as the Cartel gets him while driving his pets somewhere, PERHAPS HE FORGOT? Pitt,who dialed in his performance as Westray, claims that he has prepared for this day, and so he travels somewhere else and disguises him self with a pair of sunglasses - really? SUNGLASSES. McCarthy must give the audience more credit for these three characters intelligence. He makes it too easy for the Cartel, since these three men clearly do not reflect their characters occupations or even their dialogue. Soon you learn that the shipment was stolen by Reiner's girlfriend, played brilliantly by Diaz, whom takes off for Hong Kong. Writing as poor as this is just boring for the big screen and attempts to entertain with scary assassinations and babbeling characters, such as the Mexican Drug Lord who explains to The Counselor that he cannot expect any thing positive in the world he has created for himself, but he does so by repeating his message over and over and over. Well acted by most of the actors, none of the characters are the least bit appealing, thus you do not care when terrible things happen to them. Scott shot the movie well, but that is its only redeeming feature. Thanks for listening.",1419120000,3,3473,4.685761047463175

5591465,4,B00BEIYRQA,"From the existentialist plot to the crude reality scenes--this movie is outstanding--I regret falling for bad reviews when it debuted and not watching at the movie theatre, where every great movie should be watched.  My sister rented the movie, hated it/did not even finish watching.  During an outing with my 15 yr. old they stopped to rent movies, when my son was looking for options she told him that I would probably like it.  On a lazy night this summer, while walking out of the grocery store, my son asked if he could rent a movie from red box, I said yes, while looking he saw the counselor, and told me that it was about El Paso, up until then, I had passed on every opportunity to watch the movie because of some of the reviews I had read-- all the while--and from years of experience--knowing that one should not trust the critics/experts--I've watched too many bad movies thanks to reviews.  I wasn't sure I wanted my son to watch this movie--ratings also don't tell me much as far as age appropriateness, so on a weekend when he was on daddy time I rented the movie and was entranced by it and the depiction of life in this border town of El Paso, Texas/CD. Juarz, Chihuahua.  Most of the scenes are filmed outside of El Paso--however, the director was able to capture the overall culture in this border area and how life can become a worthless and expandable nuance.  I was also impressed at how torture and killing/disappearance tactics are portrayed--staying true to reality.  As a native of El Paso Texas, and a border studies graduate, I appreciate movies that truly depict how one lives in this beautiful city constantly adapting to the on going cultural changes of the money making machine of drugs/drug lords and their servants who do the dirty work for them knowing that any minute their boss could terminate them.  Don't get me wrong El Paso is a safe, beautiful and up and coming city with lots to do and look forward to--but it is also the den for many  crimes  committed in CD. Juarz,  Mxico as a result of the drug trafficking that expands to the rest of the U.S., North America and Europe.  Most of these drug lords commute between El Paso and CD. Juarz on a daily basis they have dual citizenship and their lives are as eccentric and frivolous as that of Bardem and Diaz in the movie--their place of business is here in the borderline so they create a nice world to live in, with nice homes and nice country clubs for their nightly outings-but don't be mistaken they live their lives in other cities and countries.  Although The Counselor is fiction--I find that it is very close to reality, Bardem, Diaz and Cruz are superb in their acting.  I watched the movie that weekend and rented it to watch with my son later in the summer, analysing with and for him the narc culture, the disposable lives within it and its consequences.

Cormac McCarthy was berated for his screenplay, and yet reportedly all the actors in the movie jumped at the chance to participate because of the dialogues beauty and philosophical depth. Yes, theres an elegance in the vocabulary that some of these characters may not use in reality, but I feel this is a morality work and isn't intended to be taken at face value. The screenwriter hoped the viewer would listen and not just watch. The phone exchange between Ruben Blades El Jefe and Fassbenders counselor near the end is unforgettable!

The cast is really good, and I can never get enough of Javier Bardem's accent. I really liked all the characters, but one (which I know I wasn't supposed to like). Some things were just personally too graphic for me. Even things that were only alluded to and not shown on screen (for good reason)

The movie also features several memorable scenes that stay with you long after the end credits roll, not the least of which is Diaz' ""golf course Ferrari"" sequence which will leave you, as Javier Bardem's character says, ""just stunned.""  The Brad Pitt ""bolito"" scene at the end of the movie likewise is a doozy that one will not soon forget.  It's hard to understand how a film like this could receive the extreme badmouthing it did at the time it was released, but I consider it to be quite an entertaining look at how a man's one time only decision to delve into the frightening world of the Mexican drug cartels could lead to a hell from which there is no escape.",1415232000,6,1082,4.444444444444445
5591583,5,B00BEIYRQA,"Let's just say I've been desensitized.  The American moviescape has done a very good job of pushing the envelope to the point that  nothing excites, nothing thrills, nothing frightens anymore.  Overdone CGI of impossibly intense action sequences, overwrought gore, and schitzophrenic camera work all combine with a formulaic delivery that has all the passion of a pay-per-click advertising revenue model.  But this is not one of those films.  The Counselor elicits a visceral reaction that is a rare treat in the modern movie schlock-fest.

The Counselor is one of those rare gems that gives the audience a little credit; it proceeds with the assumption that they possess an attention span and depth of emotion suitable to absorb the developing gloom that surrounds it's main characters.  Ridley Scott has slowed the world to seven-eighths-speed to give the good and the bad extra time to seep into your bones.  It's a movie that begs to be slowly relished like a lollipop, and in it's course one experiences a transition from relishing the sweetness to an unnerving realization that it's sweetness is due to something gone rotten.  The main characters are not the actors - it is the confluence of risky money and high living with the brutal savagery of it's underworld counterpart that everyone likes to pretend does not exist.  This is not an action movie, or a thriller, or a party flick.  This is something you watch when you want to walk away feeling like you've been punched in the gut.

When you watch this movie, you make a decision to change your world into the one that exists after you watch this movie.  And there is no return to the world that could have been had your choice been different.  The way you may want things to be at that point does not matter, there is only the way things are.

The character provided enigmatic depth to the words that they speak to each other would only give gladness to the Philosophy and Poetry majors and could have been a burden to a lot. Weird scenes also added to the mess especially with Cameron Diaz having sex with the car to prove that her character Malkina is a femme fatale and one of a kind female villain would also be good source of parody and comedy. Too bad that the viewer should see it more than once to give it a better appreciation considering its theme of greed,materialism and avarice is definitely needed in tough economic times.

5591729,2,B00BEIYRQA,"Great photography, nice acting - but a ridiculous plot and drivelling dialogue makes this a really annoyingly rotten movie!
So powerfully annoying, that I went out of my way to write this overlong review!

On the rotten side, the plot is full of loopholes (or what my friends like to call 'plot-holes.') SPOILER ALERT -
For instance, the whole crux of the movie is that the hero is suspected of hijacking a truckload of cocaine because
he bailed out a cartel messenger (who carried the keys to starting the truck) several MONTHS before this messenger
was tasked to deliver the keys!  Why would even crazed Mexican mafia killers make such a connection?  After all, the
hero is a LAWYER who is representing the messenger's mother in a different case - months before the hijack occurs.

  The messenger is killed by having a thin wire stretched across the highway (the messenger is a biker who loves to speed) -
but this is a HIGHWAY - no other vehicles ever use this HIGHWAY from the time the wire is planted until the messenger comes
roaring through?  And so on - nothing in the plot makes much sense.
And the dialogue!  One note - everyone talks the same way: a sort of bleak macho cynicism,  irregardless of who is talking or
what the situation is.  Reminds me of George Higgins, who started writing great novels and then fell into a rut where
everyone sounded the same, also a sort of macho bleakness but in his case obviously fueled by too much alcohol.
McCarthy is just getting old to the point where he thinks everyone talks like a grumpy old man.
The one bright spot is the brilliant directing and photography of RIdley Scott, which makes the 20 minutes of action shots worth
viewing, if you don't mind a LOT of fast forwarding to avoid the dialogue. Hence the two stars.
I think the critics who liked this were blindsided by McCarthy's reputation.  Come to think, even No COuntry for Old Men,
directed by the brilliant Coen brothers, had quite a few plotholes.  McCarthy is the obverse of someone who is
so determined to see good outcomes that their plots become illogical -
McCarthy is so determined to see evil win that his plots just get RIDICULOUSLY illogical.",1412899200,4,2171,4.625

People keep forgetting that Ridley Scott directed The Counselor (2013), the guy who gave us films such as: Blade Runner (1982), GI Jane (1997), Gladiator (2000), or Matchstick Men (2003)...he is a movie director that is not afraid to make different kinds of movies (genre speaking).

The Counselor is the type of movie were the viewer needs to tune in, its the type of film were you need to listen attentively to what is being said.  This movie is all about dialogue (70%) and some interesting, realistic, and original action scenes (30%).  The cast is PERFECT, and every actor and actress was chosen for their role impeccably well.  Although, I would have rather see Antonio Banderas or Benicio Del Toror  in the role of Reiner.  Javier Bardem has very unnatural way of speaking in English...his lines seem memorized and spoken with outburst.
The three characters that stand out are the three Americans: Michael Fassbender  (The Counselor), Cameron Diaz (Malkina), and Brat Pitt
(Westray).  Fassbender is persuasive and believable as the main character.  But it is Cameron Diaz and Brat Pitt who I think steal the show. Diaz is !@#$%^ sensational as the typecast femme fatale.  Her leopard back tattoo, make up, cold and arrogant nature, and way of delivering her lines are just top-notch. Well created dark character.  Brat Pitt, on the other hand, plays a typical character of his, an American (in this case Canadian) who is a an over-confident cowboy-dressed womanizer, and professional middle-man, whose one-liners and quick-wittedness make him stand out from the crowd as the only Mr. Cool in this one.

When you see a film shot mostly in such harsh lighting, especially about a subject like high-level drug smuggling and dealing, you quickly know, no good is going to come of it.

The director and writer wanted to convey the extreme violence connected with that world, and not romanticize it the way some films do.

As I pontificate the nature of reality, fate has devised a hideous noose out of all my sequestered mediocrity into one ginormous unadorned bleakly knotted nod into the sleepy time slumberland of yawning oxygen deprived reality. An inescapable bolito around my neck. Hot & cold running faucets of heroin truth. Fate is the inhuman machine of consequence and choice. A viseral decapitation. A terrifying and bloody crucifixion of cause and effect. A whistling buzzbomb of whirling gears already set into land speed record motion. A Japanese rice burner hurtling towards one unstoppable conclusion as it decapitates my existence and sends it reeling into the purely meaningless void of philosophic movie nihilism. (So sue me, I really really like decapitation. Cormac McCarthy likes it too.) All this, fellow traveler. All this, while man-eating cheetahs gnaw at my insipid loins."" - philosophy hipster clarifying the symbolism in this film (not actual dialogue from the film, but it sure sounds like it)

LOL @ Cormac McCarthy

(actual dialogue from the film)

""Reflective men often find themselves at a place removed from the realities of life.""

Really, Cormac? Really? Silly me. I always thought it was the opposite. Reflective men lift the veil of delusion. I like this Buddhist quote, ""Even a tarnished mirror will shine like a jewel if it is polished. A mind which presently is closed by illusions originating from the innate darkness of life is like a tarnished mirror, but once it is polished it will become clear, reflecting the enlightenment of immutable truth"" - Nichiren Daishonin

Or how about this one, ""Grief transcends value. A man would give whole nations to lift it from his heart. And yet with it you can buy nothing.""

Really? I wouldn't trade it for anything. It separates me from the dumb beast. It's what makes me human. And it just might cause a man to devote his entire life to curing cancer.

I could go on and on picking at the inane navel gazing dialogue in this film, but I'm bored. Man, and I thought No Country For Old Men was nihilistic drivel.

5592328,5,B00BEIYRQA,"Spoiler Alert!  What I loved about this movie is that you have to pay close attention to each character's story to appreciate how they get trapped into the violence and mayhem,  This effort is usually not essential to enjoying most crime-dramas, but its mandatory for this one.  Their motivations are essential to understanding the events in the movie.

For the three main male characters, they are all undone by their own myopia:  Reiner is distracted by his decadent lifestyle so much that he doesn't take the necessary precautions needed for his line of work. Westray is counting on his disappearing act to protect him if things go wrong, but doesn't realize he's already on somebody's radar.  The Counselor decides to wade into criminal activity after watching from the sidelines for years to provide for himself and his future bride.

The two main female characters are light and dark:  Laura is innocent, church-going and in love.  She doesn't seem as enamored of the luxury lifestyle as the Counselor and probably would have been happy with more modest circumstances if consulted.  Malkina is even more dangerous that she appears to be initially.  As her machinations are revealed, it becomes apparent that she's the only one see the larger opportunity this situation presents.

The Juarez/El Paso location is its own character:  The dichotomy between two national cultures sitting side-by-side, law abiding vs. lawless, expensive cars driving through derelict towns, intrigue in mansions vs. mundane work surrounding the drug transportation in septic tanks, etc.

If you happen to like movies that don't treat the audience as simpletons, however, and you can stomach the unfortunate path of the narrative, it's truly worth the effort. The screenplay is absolutely brilliant - it tells you everything you need to know, but just barely. It's packed with symbolism, innuendo, and requires the audience to connect some of the clues. I admit, I had to watch it a few times to truly understand it completely - both the exact details of the story and the symbolism along with its meaning. Once you get it, though, you'll realize what a bold, daring piece of work it really is.

5592409,4,B00BEIYRQA,"THE COUNSELOR is a 2013 British-American thriller film directed by Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"") from an original film screenplay by Cormac McCarthy (""No Country For Old Men""). The film stars Michael Fassbender as the eponymous Counselor--who gets in over his head in a drug deal around the troubled Juarez, Mexico/Texas border area--as well as Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Penlope Cruz and Brad Pitt. The film deals with themes of greed, death, the primal instincts of humans and their consequences...or so says Wikipedia.

Well, I'm not so sure about the theme of greed or primal instincts.  Sure, Fassbender's character needs, or thinks he needs, a few more dollars after he flies to Amsterdam to buy his beloved Laura (Penelope Cruz) a 3.9 carat diamond ring.  And Reiner, the Counselor's entrepreneurial friend played by Javier Bardem, does seem to revel in primal experience after his girl friend, Malkina (Cameron Diaz), who has a cheetah print tattoo and owns two pet cheetahs, makes love to his Ferrari.  I think that's what he's reveling in...she surely is.

THE COUNSELOR is a wild ride, folks.  Very well done with snippets of one astonishing scene after another. And all with beautiful people living in beautiful places and wearing beautiful clothes.  Costume designer Janty Yates collaborated with Giorgio Armani to create the wardrobes for Fassbender and Cruz's characters.  Designer Paula Thomas dressed Cameron Diaz's character, Malkina, with about fifteen extravagant outfits accessorized with like and large jewelry. For Javier Bardem's character, Yates chose a widely colorful wardrobe that was mostly made up of pieces of Versace.  Bardem's hair was the actor's own idea and inspired by film producer Brian Grazer's hairdo. Brad Pitt plays a middle man, a philosophical Texas cowboy, wearing white Stetsons and tailored Western suits. (In a way, Pitt is updating his role in ""Thelma and Louise,"" his first film also directed by Ridley Scott.)

The movie does have a literary theme of sorts. Toward the end of the film, the Counselor seeks the advice of The Jefe (Rubn Blades), a cartel kingpin, about his problems.  The Jefe quotes the Spanish poet Antonio Machado and recites a bit of his poem ""Campos de Castilla"" ...Caminante, no hay camino. Se hace camino al andar...which translates in its original context as: ""Wanderer, your footsteps are the road, and nothing more; wanderer, there is no road, the road is made by walking. By walking one makes the road, and upon glancing behind one sees the path that never will be trod again..."" He concludes by telling the Counselor to live with the choices he has made: ""You are the world you have created. And when you cease to exist, that world you have created will also cease to exist.""

There have been soooo many movies made where you actually have to think people, come on, sheesh.  I for one love movies that really make you think and don't spoon feed me.

5592778,4,B00BEIYRQA,"First, let me say that I agree with another reviewer who brilliantly made fun of those who hated this movie, and give it one star, because they thought it was too confusing. That is true. This is a taunt, thoughtful, psychological thriller. It's not for those who see names like Brad Pitt and Penelope Cruz and think it's going to be a mindless action film.

You have to pay attention, fill in a few blanks for yourself, and have a basic understanding of the drug world, at least the drug world taught to us by Hollywood.

If you have that you will likely enjoy this movie very much. It's definitely a ""guy flick."" It is uncomplimentary to women in almost every way imaginable. Exploiting both stereotypes of how shallow yet ruthless women can be.

For that reason I deduct a star. The characters could've been better flushed out especially given the level of talent attracted. most every character in this film is a philosopher and has their moments when they drone on for a page or two about the meaning of life as seen through the eyes of those in the drug world. It gets a little tiring after the fourth or fifth time. There are also some logic problems as characters seem smart enough to figure out A,B,C, but not smart enough to to figure out D,E, and F.  But most people tend not to realize that actors don't write their own dialogue. They are paid to say what's on the page the way the director tells them to say it.

The real credit here for anything you like about this movie goes to Ridley Scott. He took an otherwise flawed script and added enough to hold your interest for two hours.",1399593600,,1596,4.433447098976109

I am sure I was awake for the whole movie, but I just as well could have been asleep because that is exactly how the story moves along. I rate this one star because I am lost as to how we moved from one point to the next, there was just a severe lack of information in the movie. It really felt like someone cut the middle part of the movie out and just combined the beginning and the end.

The characters are all somewhat overdrawn, although fortunately not overacted, and the plot offers a number of unpleasant surprises along the way.  Javier Bardem slips comfortably into his now familiar role as the menacing capo, as does Brad Pitt as the slick 21st century artful dodger.

I felt like she was just eye candy and not very important but if you watch the trailer about the film it will have you believe other wise. I don't care who the actor or actress is in movies like this the message is always very clear which is don't sell drugs, it's a messy multibillion dollar business that will have you either died, in jail or on the run!

I wanted it to be short and yet reflect what I felt the first time I saw the movie.  My first impression was:  ""This one is not for the usual audience; the dialogue and the way the story unfolds, are superbly done"".  It made me want more; read the book is in my to do list.  Cameron Diaz gets the best lines in the entire movie but the one that stole my attention completely was the scene with Ruben Blades and how he conveys very profound thoughts in a few carefully chosen words.  The movie itself pays attention to a lot of details and has Scott's signature themes all over; in my view one I don't mind watching time and time again because of the contrasts it has.  I know others have not enjoyed this movie and I respect their views.  To me, this is one of his best movies.  A few years from now, it may become a 'cult' one too.

The moral of the story, if you could call it that, is that you can't dabble in crime, and you can't dally with evil.  Either you have to be prepared to go all the way, and lose everything in the process, or the sharks will gobble you up like the pathetic little minnow you are.  Brad Pitt tries to warn Michael Fassbender of this just before Fassbender makes one bad decision that derails his entire life.  The cast is superb and several of the set pieces are flawlessly executed, but when the cast begins to suffer the same fate (flawlessly executed), I felt caught in the same inexorable trap.  Honestly, I watched this film several weeks ago, and it has cast a pall on my existence ever since.  Hopefully writing this review will serve as some sort of much-needed therapy.

5593344,1,B00BEIYRQA,"I don't know about you, but I really hate when a film Im highly anticipating shows itself to be a huge waste of time.  When the year began (2013) there was one film that was at the VERY top of my most anticipated list; The Counselor.  This just had everything I wanted in a movie.  First, it had an original screenplay (the first) written by Cormac McCarthy, who writes such marvelously constructed books that served for some really great films in the aughts (namely No Country for Old Men and The Road).  Next, it had a pretty stellar cast.  I mean, Fassbender is so hot right now (in more than one way) and the idea of Cruz, Bardem, Pitt, Perez and Ganz in the same film made me really excited.  Third, early word was that the script was crazy and that the plum role of the devilish Malkina was going to Cameron Diaz, an actress who is really underrated and deserved a break, critically.  But really, the sole reason I was rooting for this to work was that Ridley Scott is in dire need of a true comeback, and I was praying that this was going to finally be his Oscar ticket.

This was absolutely, undeniably, 100% abysmal.

I don't even know what to say about this.  Like, Im at a complete and total loss for words, and that rarely happens.  I don't even know how to go about reviewing this, because in my mind I didn't really watch anything at all.  The film felt like one, long, boring conversation that made no sense whatsoever and failed to grab my interest one bit.  The character development was a joke, the performances were embarrassing and the plot was so thick with holes (or maybe they weren't holes at all and we just weren't really given a plot) that I found myself wishing I had decided to pass on this entirely.

And lets talk about Cameron Diaz for a minute.  I was one of her chief champions prior to seeing this.  I declared her underrated and declared, in advance, that this was going to be the performance of the year!  I wanted this to be so wonderful for her, but this character is a joke.  What is so alarming about this is that it isn't even all her performance (which is pretty bad, to be honest), but the character itself is just so uninteresting.  Yes, she likes cheetahs and there is that car scene, but that scene itself is so ridiculously shot that it feels like a parody of a much better executed sequence.  I think it was a true disservice to her performance to redub it without the accent (which remained in some scenes and thus made her performance uneven) because it took any soul the character had, any spice, and threw it out the window.

Like the rest of the film, Malkina was just bland.

Drugs, snuff films, murder, dangerous cats, fast cars, wet windshields and Penelope Cruz have never been so dull.  I cant believe that the one film I anticipated most this year just turned out to be the worst film I saw in 2013.

Yes, I mean that.  This was worse than that dreadful Walking with Dinosaurs.  At least that movie had something going one (but seriously, that was just terrible).",1397088000,,3023,4.411552346570397

I loved Brad Pitts and Javier Bardems performances but think someone else should have played the lead character instead of Michael Fassbender i think hes a great actor but just didn't seem right for this part.
Also Cameron Diazs part I think would have been better with a younger actress as shes 42 and was trying to play a mid twenty , partying , wild , club going gold digger and just didn't feel right though she still looks great as does Penelope cruz. the is a really weird car scene with her really bizarre... If you saw the film you know exactly what im talking about.
i think this movie fell short due to the trying to fit as many big hollywood stars in 1 movie as we can , sometimes it works but most of the time this formula fails.

5593351,2,B00BEIYRQA,"I knew this movie got bad reviews but I have to admit, I was kind of surprised to see a 2 star overall rating after over 500 reviews. When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought it was going to be incredible. I mean how could it not be, with one of the greatest directors of all time in Ridley Scott, a fantastic writer who's adapted novel won Best Picture (No Country for Old Men) in Cormac McCarthy and an excellent cast which includes Javier Bardem (Oscar Winner for No Country), Penelope Cruz, Michael Fassbender and Cameron Diaz, not to mention a smaller role from non other than Brad Pitt.

I watched the unrated extended cut, which isn't always better, but since Ridley Scott essentially invented the Director's Cut I thought it would probably be the best version to watch, in spite of all the bad press. The first and most obvious problem with the movie is it's pacing. This will probably turn most people off, immediately calling the film 'boring'. Unfortunately the pacing really interrupts a smooth flow of the movie and steals a sense of desire and motivation from the viewers. While there is a story underneath there somewhere it is hidden beyond a collection of philosophy and seemingly unnecessary vulgar stories. It's obvious to see a novelist wrote the screenplay for this film as there are many instances in the movie where lots of time is taken up from storytelling.

If your intent is to lose yourself for 2 hours in a film of action or any kind of good feelings, this isn't the one for you. The intent of this film (to the best of my, no doubt, shallow film critiquing abilities) is to highlight various flaws in the human condition and their outcome in the ""real"" world, while also exposing some of the harsh realities of life (or death) in association with drug cartels.

I have to admit that it is an interesting study of human flaws, yet there was almost a gleeful reveling in the filthiness of them. The reason I give this one star (in addition to deceptive marketing) is that the aforementioned depravity was portrayed in a manner that is unnecessarily graphic, in a sense glorifying the very thing the film/novel is presumably attempting to condemn. In addition, without the context of the book, the subtleties of the plot-line were difficult to follow, and at times simply too muddled to really make sense of. I am sure that if I went back to watch it again, I would pick up on a lot more of them, but I have no intention of doing so.

In conclusion, I came looking for entertainment, and was instead taught a ""valuable life lesson"" by the cartel lord. I'm not sure why it seemed fitting to the writers/producers to use a character (that willingly mutilated and beheaded an innocent person) to deliver their paramount message to the audience.

5593649,5,B00BEIYRQA,"This is a complicated yet great movie, I will not elaborate on that any further and while many people don't seem to get this movie this should not detract anyone from discovering it for themselves.
The reason for me writing this is being fed up with studio politics (again!) concerning the two versions of this movie contained within this edition. I have had it with studios suggesting to us movie fans that obviously and miraculously  only inferior versions of their movies are shown in cinemas and that we as fans would owe it to ourselves to buy the consecutive home release of these films because only they contain the only true cut. So, this version features both the 1.57 hrs theatrical cut as well as the 2.17 hrs extended cut. The operative word here is ""extended"". This longer version contains an audio commentary by the film's director, Ridley Scott. In this commentary, he states multiple times that the extended version is just that: extended. It is not a director's cut by any means, all of the scenes that were taken out were deleted for a reason and are not meant to be within the movie at all. Having watched both cuts I find the theatrical and therefore director's cut of the movie to be perfect at slightly under two hours running time. The extended scenes in the longer version do not add anything substantial, useful or relevant but they slow the movie down quite a bit, which hurts it since pacing is very important in a film that is mostly comprised of people having high end conversations. To sum it up, the extended cut may be interesting in terms of getting a glimpse into the evolution of a movie, the way the movie is advertised however is just misleading and all the numerous internet reviewers that go on about how much better this movie is in its elongated version obvioulsy either do not share the director's vision or simply don't know what they are doing having bought into the studio BS. On a side note, this keeps happening to a lot of Ridley Scott films. Gladiator for example was a fantastic movie in its theatrical version, and even when released also in a extended cut a disgruntled Ridley Scott rang with himself not to say anything wrong in the special edition DVD/BD introduction. He even then specifically stated that the theatrical version was the director's cut and that the longer version was for enthusiasts at best. The same thing happened with American Gangster, in the commentary of which Scott described in detail why which scene had to be cut only to have them reinserted by the studio in the extended cut DVD/BD and sold as the superior version. Same case with Black Hawk Down, by the way. It should also be mentioned that whenever people claim that a longer cut was no problem since it contains anything anyway these people should consider the fact that the movie's soundtrack has to be heavily altered, remixed and repeated to accommodate the additional footage, thereby in fact altering the dynamic of even unchanged scenes. Lengthening a movie is mostly a bad idea contrary to common believe, and if the longer version would be the director's cut it would gladly be called that by the studios: a ""director's cut""!
I would like to mention perhaps the most striking example of a director's cut: Ridley Scott's brother, the late Tony Scott and my favorite director, made the movie Revenge in 1990. Due to studio pressure, reshoots had to be done to artificially create a more elaborate love story in the first half of the movie. In 2007 Tony reconstructed his directors cut of the movie by removing almost 30 minutes of material and just reinserting a few new takes, also many takes were altered. This shorter version was much better because it acknowlegded itself as being a movie, not a book and therefore trying to keep a proper pacing without boring the viewer to death. The point I am trying to make is that a movie is basically created three times: In writing, in shooting and finally in editing. While no one would buy a movie the sript of which has been changed for the home release or that was reshot with different actors, yet studios have made us believe the heavily recut and elongated versions they sell us would actually improve a movie.

5593650,2,B00BEIYRQA,"A disappointment to me, despite the positives. Is really nothing more than a series of loosely connected vignettes that are never really clearly connected - like a quilt of interesting and colorful patches that is extremely weak at the seams.

LOL at the pseuds who worship this film and denigrate those who did not enjoy it - as if it is a clear delineation obetween the intellectual haves and have-nots. And reveling in their genius as they write a tome about the film. (Because they don't have more important matters to tend to).

5593866,3,B00BEIYRQA,"A very successful lawyer, the Counselor, becomes involved in some heavy drug trafficking. The Counselor (Michael Fassbender) starts to work with a middleman known as Westray (Brad Pitt) to make more money than imagine. However, things start going down hill and the Counselor must now protect him and his fianc as people start to die.

Overall this movie was slow at parts but consists of some action scenes. It seems at times the movie leaves you with questions as it goes from one scene to another. The main focus is on the Counselor trying to get things straight from a drug trafficking plan that went the wrong way. Now he is trying to protect himself and bride to be. He request help from his middleman, but can Westray be trusted? When it comes to drugs, no one can be trusted! It seemed as the Counselor just gets dropped into his predicament without further explanation. It leaves you wondering why he went into this side job. Was he low in cash? There are too many questions left unanswered especially after the ending.

This movie does require some focus to watch, however the action scenes make the movie exciting. If you are looking for a cheap movie night, this movie may be a possibility but I do not recommend it.

5593924,1,B00BEIYRQA,"This is an oppressively BAAAAD movie, awful for one simple reason, its inane, incoherent, and terribly pompous screenplay, written by Cormac McCarthy.

Pompous and nonsensical dialogue, waxing in pseudo-poetic and  cheap pop philosophy, weaves throughout this movie.  Urgh.

And just what exactly was this plot supposed to be about?  A dark look at the ferocious drug trade with Mexico that has destroyed the lives of thousands?  We knew that already, from reading the news, did we not?  An even darker look at women, as both victims and exploiters of their status with men as sexual objects?

The movie leaves you only with this lasting, depressing feeling of having wasted two hours of your life watching something really violent and nasty that could have been better spent doing just about anything else, like cleaning the toilets and the bird cage at home.

It's like the sensation you get from having just eaten something bad for you - you want to throw it up but can't quite get it out.

The screenplay wastes some terrific acting talent.  Michael Fassbender is impressive, and Carmen Diaz has never been more terrifyingly evil and malicious.

If the narco wars made you terrified about visiting Mexico before, this movie will confirm all of your fears and more.

And that's about it for this movie.  A waste of two hours.

The men talk to him about beauty, friendship, love, and the consequences of decisions that may not even look like decisions.

This is one of them.  It doesn't spoon feed the story to you.  You have to watch with your brain in gear and pay attention to the details because they matter.  I love the way it went from an almost sickly sweet love story to a grim and dark vision.  I loved the way the feeling of foreboding built till the final scenes when it drops you through the floor.  If you love seeing something different than the regurgitated crap that passes for entertainment today, you owe it to yourself to check this film out.  Great story.  Great cast though Cameron Diaz was miscast in my humble opinion.  Love her as an actress but she is too sweet to play one of the most evil characters I have seen lately.

Yes, there a few mysterious characters.  Who cares?  If nothing happens, why am I watching?

The only good scene in this movie was the decapitation of the motorcycle driver.  Ironically, it was that point that I was about ready to chop my own head off.

The Counselor is a provocative thriller that most won't understand or appreciate, but if you're one of the few who can accept its differences, what you'll find is a pure gem. Fassbender, Pitt, and Bardem all give lovely multi-layered performances as characters who must accept the choices they've made and wait for the inevitability of their fates, and when their worlds come crashing down, Scott and McCarthy are able to make them sympathetic in a way that makes us reflect on our own lives and ask the the eternal question ""what if?""

5594221,4,B00BEIYRQA,"One of the things I think that differentiates McCarthy from a vast majority of authors is how he seldom spends time explaining things. It's almost provocative (and oftentimes confusing) but the payoff, the message, is tremendous: if someone were to read a piece by McCarthy, that person is treated with a respect found nearly no place else. In a phrase, he's saying ""You're smart enough where I don't have to tell you everything."" One might also venture to say that he's trying to capture the ambiguity of reality, which is kind of a feat in and of itself. That's what he has done with The Counselor. You aren't told everything; you aren't let into any of the characters heads and you are not allowed to know explicitly what drives them. Instead, you are an observer, like in real life, trying desperately to keep up with the way that these people are all about. This is NOT for everybody. One of the previous reviews called it ""lyrical"" and I think that's quite apt. The characters often speak metaphorically and it's left up to the viewer to decide exactly what those words were meant to imply. It's like one long, visceral poem where at the end, you may be unsure of its intent, but you know that whatever it wanted you to feel, you felt it.
This film is for literary and film-focused people. It's a study, not a blockbuster, and it never seeks to even pretend that it is. The performances by the central cast are all phenomenal (not to mention from the auxiliary cast and an awesome and appropriate cameo by Dean Norris!), chewing up the dialogue. At times it felt like a stage production, but that, I believe, is to the benefit of the film. The score is also tremendous, not in the booming fanfare kind of way, but more along the lines of what Gustavo Santaolalla did in The Last of Us; mostly subtle so as not to distract from the (frequently) difficult to follow (but absolutely satisfying) dialogue, but ""loud"" enough to keep things from getting stale.
Again, this is not a blockbuster, so for those expecting set piece after set piece, seek it elsewhere. Anybody looking for a thought-provoking look at how Cormac McCarthy's style translates to screen, this is your flick.",1394928000,6,2181,4.652849740932642

5594295,2,B00BEIYRQA,"A lawyer (Fassbender) finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking with tragic consequences.

At first glance, this movie has it all, a great cast, Ridley Scott and a tale about the consequences of greed but unfortunately even this great cast cannot save this nonsensical plot, scenes that make no sense (the Ferrari car sex scene for example) with long boring stretches of monotonous dialogue. The story isn't well developed and neither really are the characters. Unfortunately this movie raised my expectations with but instead gave me this, a clumsy suspense thriller that's lacking on suspense or thrills with way too much dialogue and too little of everything else.

There may be some that appreciate this style of film as this movie is definitely one that has that love/hate relationship with the movie goers. Although I am not really sure why some reviewers choose to be insulting to those that didn't like this film. This is the type of movie that really isn't everyone's cup of tea.

5594302,4,B00BEIYRQA,"I found Ridley Scott's filming of Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay, ""The Counselor"", to be a disturbing and deadly-serious morality play about how a bad choice can propel even a fairly good man into a nihilistic nightmare that takes away all he loves in life, leaving him to fester forever in the lowest hell of despair.  There are two films I know that have the darkest, most nihilistic endings for a protagonist in the history of film.  Fritz Lang's ""Scarlet Street"" which leaves the main character alive but having lost his very identity; the other is this one.

Ignore the bad reviews.  ""The Counselor"" is a first-class film with extraordinary characters and great filmmaking skill.  Michael Fassbender is great as usual as the Counselor whose one mistake destroys his soul.  I also really liked Cameron Diaz as the sociopath Malkina in ""The Counselor"", though the role drew massive amounts of vituperative spleen from most critics.

5594440,1,B00BEIYRQA,"I like this kind of movie.  I like an intricate crime drama.  I like snappy, writerly dialogue.  I like an old-school noir sensibility -- something you might describe as sexy pessimism.  I like a collection of good looking actors, led by a knockout femme fatale.  I'm a big Robert Towne fan (writer of Chinatown).  Tequila Sunrise is an underrated classic.  I wish Hollywood made more of that sort of thing.  I bemoan today's lack of quality suspense films, and dearth of quality writing.  So, despite many bad reviews, I thought I had to give this film a try.  I thought it would at least have all of those things, and it did, especially the pessimism (in this case, nihilism).  And I thought, How bad can it be?  Well, I found out.  Yes, it had that fun writerly dialogue, but the film was executed so poorly in every other respect that, by the end of it, I thought it was about the worst, most dispiriting, most laughably bad movie I had seen in years.  If it had been populated by any characters one might have been moved to take an interest in, then it would have been an upsetting downer.  But it might at least have been an interesting movie.  As it is, it's just tedious and ridiculous and icky.

The plot manages to be both thin and confusing.  I'm usually suspicious when people complain that they didn't get the movie, and I suspect that they just weren't paying attention.  Here, though, basic groundwork is needlessly held back, not just initially but for the whole film.  It's confusing because the characters -- who they are exactly, and what they're up to exactly, and why exactly -- are not explained.  We know that our main character is a criminal defense attorney for drug dealers, and that he lives lavishly.  We know that he's in love with Penelope Cruz, or, at least, in love with making love to her.  We know absolutely nothing about her except that she's cute and nice.  He has decided before the beginning of the film, for reasons unclear, to involve himself in the business end of his clients' business for the first time.  We know nothing else about him.  We don't know why he would risk his life and career to engage directly in a drug deal, except that, even as he is buying an expensive diamond ring, drives a Bentley, and lives in a modernist mansion, he is somehow hard up for cash.  We don't know what role exactly he would play in the contemplated transaction, what exactly it is (other than the movement of drugs across the country), or why his services, whatever they may be, would be useful or desirable or command a high price.  Anyway, he never appears desperate.  He never registers any emotions whatsoever, except at the end.  He merely reacts blandly and participates in empty chatter.  As a consequence, our main character, the film's namesake, never emerges as a real person.  He just comes across as a vacuous moron.

Is he doing the drug deal to pay for the ring?  We're to understand that it's an expensive, high quality ring, and that it's an expression of his love for Cruz.  Anyway, it's not clear, like much else.  But, if that's the reason, no amount of smooth talk from the diamond merchant about the worthy meaning of adornment, no amount of literary irony whereby the adornment ends up risking the person it adorns, could lend credence to so risible a conceit.  Here's a tip: before getting in bed with a notoriously brutal Mexican drug cartel, consider a ring worth less than, say, your Bentley.  Or maybe you could finance the ring!  Many better options, ring-wise.

Javier Bardem, as a drug dealer/presumable client, is entertaining -- the only character you sort of get.  He muses about this and that -- the thing about women, etc. -- and provides some of the foreshadowing.  (The movie has a lot of foreshadowing.  Don't introduce the machine that cuts the victim's carotid ""and sprays blood all over the spectators"" in Act I if you're not going to use it in Act III.)  He's living with Cameron Diaz, the villain/anti-heroine of the movie.  She's supposed to be tough, ruthless, savvy, with a whole philosophy to match -- something about the truth and beauty of being amoral.  She is repeatedly and unsubtly compared to a cheetah.  She sports an elaborate cheetah-spot tattoo and keeps a couple of big cats as pets.  She even, in one of the film's few amusing moments, humps a Ferrari, displaying an animal-like indifference to humping matter.  If all that sounds like fun, it could have been, except that Diaz doesn't make it.  She's got the look, but she can't read the lines -- or, at least, didn't in the chosen takes.  When suggested that her viewpoint is ""cold,"" she says, ""I don't believe that truth has a temperature.""  That's a pretty good line.  When she says, it comes across as silly -- you don't believe it.  She's about as menacing as a valley girl.  And, even though she's supposedly a criminal mastermind, it's unclear what she ends up gaining or how.  As for Brad Pitt, I'm not sure who he is supposed to be other than a fount of grinning and sanctimonious advice.

The movie is dark and, I think, is meant to be serious in its darkness.  Pulpy fun it ain't (especially when you realize what's probably on that disc we glimpse at the end).  But without convincing characters or situations, the darkness is unearned and artificial.  It comes across as merely sour, like bad milk.  You just want to spit it up, dump the rest down the drain, suppress the urge to vomit, and forget the whole thing.",1394668800,3,5471,4.607253886010363
5594441,3,B00BEIYRQA,"THE COUNSELOR is a visually stunning movie with good performances by its star-studded cast, but the overly talky nature of the film made it feel like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie. The story is rather simple: An unnamed lawyer, referred to only as ""Counselor"" (Fassbender) gets more than he bargains for when he enters into a one-time drug deal. Most of the movie is composed of these philosophically heady conversations and salacious anecdotes. While I would expect a movie to have some of these attributes, having a movie almost entirely composed of them starts to wear down on you a little bit. Fortunately, there were a few moments that moved the story along. Even still, they were few and far between (especially with the extended cut I watched). One part I thought was slightly miscast was Cameron Diaz as Malkina, Reiner's (Bardem) cheetah-loving mistress. There was an icy quality to her character and performance, but I didn't really buy her as somebody who wasn't American (she was supposed to be Argentinian). There are also several glorified cameo roles where they show up, talk for a little bit and then exit the picture. Most of the what they said had nothing to do with the story at all, and only served as mouthpieces for Cormac McCarthy's heavy-handed dialogue. Speaking of the dialogue, the script was the first one written by McCarthy directly for the screen, and it shows. He may be a high-caliber novelist, but he sorely needed someone to keep his style in check (like the Coen Bros. on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Ridley Scott did an impeccable job as usual in delivering a visually compelling film, with a few great action sequences (as well as one scene with Cameron Diaz which I will not spoil...suffice it to say, you won't have seen anything like it before). However, the script supporting it just isn't disciplined enough to the make the movie work like it should. One other nice thing I could say is that I enjoyed the score, which punctuated at all the right moments and was never overpowering. Generally speaking, I count this as an interesting misfire. It's definitely worth one watch, but no more.",1394668800,,2149,4.795148247978437

WARNING: Many people will casually pick up and watch this film, noticing the prominent cast and hoping for just another good legal thriller that more or less follows the formula. Those people are in for a big unpleasant surprise. THE COUNSELOR will NOT warm the heart when justice is served in the end. This film also requires close attention and won't make much sense to people who just want to be entertained without having to think too hard. [Please note that I'm not trying to insult said people and am often among them myself.] Though gory and violent, THE COUNSELOR goes no farther in those areas than lots of other films do: It's the story itself that is so bleak and disturbing. Another thing: Depending upon interpretation, certain aspects may seem misogynistic and prove particularly alienating to many women.

Though a true literary genius, novelist Cormac McCarthy is not known for his cheery optimism. In this venture into film writing, he reaches new depths of pessimism that sometimes border on the darkest nihilism. Nevertheless, there are obvious basic morals to be drawn from THE COUNSELOR.

McCarthy spits in the face of so many storytelling conventions here, creating a tale that's seldom told but so often true. It's all about the young and recently engaged ""Counselor,"" played by Michael Fassbender, who finds himself succumbing to a shady deal with a worse-than-shady crowd. The plot flies in many directions, and the sheer number of characters can be a little overwhelming. It's hard to place where everyone fits in and the game each person is playing. The transitions are abrupt, which, for some reason, seems intentional even though it doesn't exactly work. In those respects, the storyline is indeed flawed, which is why I give this film four stars instead of five. It's essentially a video novel, not simply a film adaptation of a book, something that could hasten the development of a whole new subgenre of filming. Still, let's not forget that the first novels were badly plotted, the first suspense films unsuspenseful, the first poems badly rhymed, etc. This early effort in ""video novelization"" or whatever we choose to call it employs techniques that work all the time on paper but are harder to utilize on screen. The character development in particular just isn't quite there.

Regardless, THE COUNSELOR is expertly filmed, well-acted, and compelling. Cameron Diaz especially stands out as Malkina, a character who's hard to forget no matter how much we may want to forget her. The larger-than-life dialogue is arresting in itself. This sort of script is hard to make work. Many films have tried it, but most have failed, and very few have succeeded this brilliantly. The early exchanges of dialogue between all the major sets of characters are important in foreshadowing and allowing the audience some clue of what's going on here and what will ultimately happen. I know that I missed some things on first view but am eager to watch this again. . .and again.",1394582400,12,3027,4.964497041420119

5594604,5,B00BEIYRQA,"All the main Characters are seriously flawed except that of Penelope Cruz. This is a very Raw film but it cuts deep to the quick of the brutal evil that is the current Drug Culture.

Fassbender's performance is oscar worthy and the other actors are equally excellent in their respective roles.  I've seen the movie twice and intend to purchase it as I'm certain that this movie will prove to be a classic in the near future like The First ""Alien"" or The Taxi Driver. I am spellbound as to how excellently Ridley Scott shows the un-forgiving viciousness and brutality of the Drug Cartels. And for the first time, I understand the 68 headless bodies hanging from overpasses in Mexico. And if the many users of these illegal drugs do not see that they are adding to the carnage by feeding their own addictions, they they've repressed their own consceinces so deep they may never be retrieved or reprieved. True, this movie may have its' flaws but they are minor in comparison to the tapestry it paints and I get what the director is trying to say.

5594785,4,B00BEIYRQA,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. You have been warned. This movie has a lot of negative reviews and I have to admit, I was somewhat disappointed with the movie myself. I had very high expectations going in, as I think a lot of people did. Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay certainly generated a lot of interest. I will be the first to admit: this movie failed to live up to the hype, fell far short of Cormac McCarthy's best novels, and it is simply impossible in this case to lay the blame on Hollywood or bad acting. Hollywood is notorious for diluting and ruining genuinely original writing but that is not what happened here. Nearly all of the problems with this movie are problems that can be traced to the script.

All that having been said, I think this movie is a lot better than many critics are making it out to be. I think a lot of the complaints that people had with the movie arose from a confusion of genres. People are treating this movie as if it was meant to be a thriller. I saw it described in one review as a ""drug-war"" thriller and in another as ""a meditation on capitalism in the form of a thriller about cocaine trading."" Obviously, the plot of this movie revolves around a lawyer who gets caught up in the drug trafficking trade with disastrous results. But, is that what this movie is about?

We learn very little about the specifics of the deal that the counselor (played by Michael Fassbender) has made. We know that he is involved with moving cocaine from Mexico to Chicago and that is about it. We also learn very little about the cartels themselves. We see some low level cartel members involved in the operation of transporting the cocaine in a sewage truck but there is only one scene where we get to see a high-ranking cartel member and he spends his time quoting the Spanish poet Antonio Machado, as opposed to talking about the drug-trade or money (he is most certainly NOT an image of unbridled capitalism; if anything he is an image of death and mortality).

What the movie focuses on, and it seems to me nearly all the critics neglect this fact, are the relationships between the counselor and Laura (played by Penelope Cruz) and Reiner (played by Javier Bardem) and Malkina (played by Cameron Diaz). They are the central characters in the film. The plot involving the drug deal is ancillary in this sense: it is an external force that disrupts the relationships in the film. I also do not think the movie is about greed. Reiner makes it very clear that the counselor is not motivated by greed. He tried to appeal to his greed in the past and it did not work. There is only one character who I think is motivated purely by greed and that is Malkina.

Ultimately, I think this movie is a movie about grief and the suddenness and inevitability of death. The most powerful scenes in the movie are: the scene where the counselor is talking to the high ranking drug cartel member and trying to make a deal to trade his life for Laura's, and the scene where the counselor receives a dvd from the cartel which, because of the set up by Westray (played by Brad Pitt) earlier in the film, we assume is a video of Laura's murder. The counselor's breakdown when he sees the dvd is extremely powerful and, in it, we are confronted by our own helplessness in the face of death.

The theme of our helplessness is precisely why (I think) so many people are disappointed in this movie. They were expecting a ""drug-war"" thriller, a battle between good and evil, but, as Mr. Compson says in The Sound and the Fury (I am paraphrasing): when we wage war against the world and fate, we are not only destined to lose, there is never really even any fight, because there is no one to fight. We have all seen ""drug-war"" thrillers and we have certain expectations. This movie disappoints those expectations which, I think, is a good thing.

For example, when Laura is kidnapped by the cartel. Here is the standard story that we have all seen a million times (that might be hyperbole): the cartel calls up the counselor and demands that he make reparations for the money he ""stole"" or his wife will die, they let him talk to his wife on the phone, the counselor vows to rescue her, puts together a scheme, meets some challenges on the way, but ultimately prevails (with lots of explosions, car chases and gun battles in between).

Here is what we actually get: the counselor figures out that Laura has been kidnapped because she never shows up at their arranged meeting. No one from the cartel tries to contact him about it. No one from the cartel tries to make any kind of deal with him (the cartel is, in that sense, as inexorable as fate; you cannot negotiate or make bargains with death or god). The counselor reaches out to some friend of his, who puts him in touch with a high-ranking cartel member, they have one fairly short conversation on the phone, the counselor receives a dvd of his wife's murder, and he goes home. There is never even a shred of hope that the counselor might be able to get his wife back.

The plot unfolds (or unravels) mechanically from the moment the drug deal goes wrong. It just disintegrates. I can understand why viewers who are used to taut, developing, spiraling plots would be disappointed with a decaying disintegrating plot but, personally, I found it a refreshing change of pace, and, I would have been far more disappointed if Cormac McCarthy had turned in a formulaic plot (one reviewer on Rotten Tomatoes, who I generally enjoy, was disappointed that the car chase scene ""lacked suspense"". I have two questions: first, would you really want to watch a lengthy car chase scene written by Cormac McCarthy? Is that the best use of his talents? And second, does anyone still get excited by car chase scenes?)

There are also people who complained that the plot is ""confusing"". It is true, Cormac McCarthy does not waste time explaining things to his audience. He lets the audience figure things out for themselves. Personally, I think that is a good thing. I get very frustrated with ""exposition dialogue"" in movies and television, dialogue that states the obvious, or has no purpose other than filling the audience in. The plot of the movie is not really complicated enough to require that anyway. There are really only three moving pieces: the counselor (who is allied with Westray and Reiner), the drug cartel, and Malkina (who works for no one but herself).

I give McCarthy credit for writing what I think is a well-crafted, non-formulaic plot, that is emotionally powerful. Still, this is certainly not a perfect movie. It suffers from a number of flaws that I think reviewers have nearly universally picked up on.

The first and most obvious problem is the dialogue. The critics of this movie are describing the dialogue as ""pretentious"", ""pompous"", ""pseudo-profound"", and other similar descriptive terms. While I do not necessarily agree with those adjectives (the term ""pretentious"" is almost always misused, and terms like ""pseudo-profound"" are often used when people stare into a deep pool and are disappointed when all they see is their own reflection on the surface) but I agree with the general sentiment. There is some dialogue in this movie that might work in a novel (although I am not even sure about that) but seems very out of place on the screen (""the truth has no temperature""; ""it is like being in love with easeful death"" (a reference to Keats).

There is also a lot of dialogue that I think is just wasted. For example, Westray spends a lot of time trying to convince the counselor that the drug cartels are seriously dangerous (""You might think there are things that they are incapable of but you'd be wrong""; ""They will cut out your liver and feed it to their dogs.""). I don't think, in this day and age, anyone but the hopelessly nave needs to be convinced that the drug cartels are dangerous and capable of horrific violence, and the counselor certainly seems worldly enough to grasp the risks of his venture (""Oh, you mean the drug cartel might actually kill me if things go wrong? I had never thought of that!""). It was necessary for Westray to tell the story of the snuff tape to set up the most devastating moment in the movie but all the other time he spends talking about how dangerous the cartel is seems wasted.

The second problem I think has to do with the characters. None of them are all that likable, which is actually fine with me. I don't need to like characters but I need them to be interesting. There is one extremely interesting character in the movie: Malkina. The rest are sort of boring. We learn very little about the counselor or what makes him tick (Is he a good lawyer? An idealist? A scumbag who gets criminals out on technicalities?). We learn very little about Laura (Where did she meet the counselor? What does she do for a living? How does she feel about her fiance's involvement in the drug world?). We could say the same thing about all the other characters in the movie, except for Malkina.

Malkina is quite a triumph, in my opinion. Cormac McCarthy is often criticized for the lack of female characters in his novels but, in this movie, the most interesting character is a woman. She is cruel, deceptive, cunning, and vicious. The scene where she goes to confession, just to mock the institution, along with the belief in God, is a brilliant little scene. Malkina clearly finds something disturbing about the fact that Laura is religious, it does not fit into her hedonistic, materialistic, nihilistic philosophy. She imagines that the priest must be getting off listening to the women talk about their sins (an attempt to fit religion into her own hedonistic philosophy) so she goes to test it out. Perhaps she imagines that she will be able to convert the priest to her own hedonism or perhaps she just wants her own disillusionment to be confirmed. There is, however, no doubt that without Malkina this movie would have been much less interesting.

The movie has a lot of flaws. I do not think there are any living novelists who are better writers than Cormac McCarthy. There are probably some who are just as good, but none who are better. There are certainly lots of screenwriters who are better screenwriters than Cormac McCarthy but, then again, there are even more that are worse!",1394064000,11,10316,4.632586112629852

5594909,4,B00BEIYRQA,"I'll say upfront that I can easily understand the overwhelmingly negative reactions THE COUNSELOR has provoked. It's almost as if Cormac McCarthy had never seen a movie before, and merely had someone explain to him the idea of a screenplay; and because McCarthy is already a very unique and potentially alienating writer, and because as far as I can tell nearly every facet of this movie's production was subordinated to preserving the integrity of the script down to the letter, the result is a movie that violates most of our preconceived notions of the ways that dialogue and plot should function in a Hollywood film. It's a noir with baroque philosophizing instead of the typical hardboiled speech, and it's a crime story that has been cut down to the bone, with all particular details left out and many necessary pieces of information elided over, in such a way that the viewers must connect dots themselves and make numerous assumptions. This is the bump in the road that many are not going to get over (and obviously most haven't). If you are able to accept all of this as well as McCarthy's incredibly bleak worldview, as I was, then you open yourself up to a potentially powerful experience with this movie.

I had previously read three of McCarthy's novels, so I was prepared a bit for some of the ideas here. I do think it helps to be familiar with his work. If you have seen the Coens' NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, based on a McCarthy novel, that gives some indication, though this film is more extreme in its pessimism and unconventional in structure. In fact, I am hard pressed to name another movie THE COUNSELOR reminds me of - it is very much its own unique vision. It certainly doesn't resemble anything else I've seen in American cinemas in the past few years. And because unfortunately many Americans approach film as little more than passive entertainment and recycled formulas, they are probably going to have no clue what to do with a star-studded movie like this that is actually doing something completely different, and challenging them as viewers. But I think everyone involved in the making of THE COUNSELOR should be credited for doing something so original, and even if I don't think it's a perfect movie (Cameron Diaz is horribly miscast and just awful in her role) I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to McCarthy fans, or just someone with an open mind.",1393891200,,2380,4.734939759036145

The actors/actresses?  Garbage!  Heavy-hitter actors'/actresses and they couldn't deliver their lines any better than a poorly-rehearsed ninth-grade pageant!  Pathetic!

5595172,3,B00BEIYRQA,"At the request of a friend who reads my reviews often, he offered me the chance to watch this movie. It is Oscar Sunday and today I bring you my review on: The Counselor.

In the movie we get introduced to a guy who is known throughout the movie simply as, Counselor. Mr. Counselor lives a pretty above decent lifestyle: the nice car, house, beautiful girlfriend. But one thing that is apparent early on is that he has ties to some pretty dangerous people or people with bad dealings. An example would be Counselor and one character discussing a drug deal. But without giving too much away, here are more details on why I choose to review this movie.

First, the characters. I enjoyed how well each actor personified his/her role in the movie. The story line has a dark tone; and I don't mean grotesque or horrifying, but more like a cunning, devious feel to it. The Counselor is not exactly unpredictable, but there are times when you are not always sure who to trust. The Counselor is not great but fortunately for the viewer, it does has some good moments.

I have read a lot of the reviews for this movie specifically. As for my final thought, it would be to say that Ridley Scott certainly has not made a classic or movie to completely rave about with The Counselor, but it is an intriguing, mentionable addition to his filmography as a director. I will not say that you will buy this movie once you watch it, but I give this movie a likable

It is about a lawyer that gets involved with drug dealers and when a cartel gets robbed and killed the lawyer is blamed because he was who got him out of jail.

That makes it a  challenging experience that is part theater and part movie. I'm not surprised that many reviewers slated it: if you were expecting a blockbuster in which the images do all the work and the dialogue is bare-bones you'd be disappointed, and maybe angry at having to pay close attention throughout. But if you're a true fan of Cormac McCarthy's singular work and relish his sublime language this movie is not to be missed.",1393632000,,572,4.71

BUT wow..is it bad. a nonsensical plot with events that come out of no where and absolutely no character development. And an ending that is so unsatisfying that it is hard to be believed. There is one likeable person in the whole movie and that is okay. If you are going to make a film about drug runners etc I expect to find most characters unsympathetic but damn! By the end of the movie, I really cared so little about the obligatory killing spree that I almost turned it off. Please don't waste your time.

5595229,2,B00BEIYRQA,"This movie had great potential.  Lack of character development and a self indulgent fixation on philosophical dribble by a few of the characters made it hard to follow and less of a thriller than it could have been.  Why did the counselor get involved in the first place?  Why did he get involved with this crew instead of a more believable group from his own social circle?  This movie was a collection of interesting scenes and scenarios but with little to connect them in the form of a story.  I typically like anything Ridley Scott is involved in but this one was a bit disappointing...  A screen full of potentially very interesting characters with very little to connect them....  So much time spent on things that just didn't build the story...I want a remake, a do over, another chance because it could have been very good.",1393632000,,831,4.6506849315068495

Brad Pitt was weird, seemed to be playing a character he's played before, or maybe playing himself. Same with Bardem.  I've seen these characters before. Fassbender's American accent bothered me, they should just let him be himself. Story line is good but I didn't feel like there was any emotion until the end.",1393545600,,401,4.465753424657534
5595295,5,B00BEIYRQA,In my mind a movie uses cinematography to elevate the story line  and this movie did that well.  The movie is graphic but that helps to express the nature of the business and lifestyle of the characters.  A thought provoking movie.,1393545600,4,231,4.585365853658536

5595299,2,B00BEIYRQA,"Oh wait... Dumb and Dumber has been taken already. Okay, how about... Jackass? Nope, taken. Okay, fine then. The Counselor.

The Counselor is a cautionary tale of how bad things happen to really, really, really stupid people. And I mean REALLY stupid people. Like, the wife who's lawyer husband flies to Amsterdam to buy her and ring and takes her to a pool party in Ciudad Juarez. No red flags there, missy, he's totally legit!

Then you have said husband - a lawyer who likes to do legal gigs for shady people and hook up with ultra-shady people to make money on the side. Because if you're rich enough to fly to Amsterdam to buy your wife a ring, you totally need to kick it in Juarez with a moronic drug dealer who wears bad silk shirts and keeps cheetahs as pets. I see no risk there.

And as for said moron... he apparently needs no business skills to survive in his violently competitive market. All he needs is a stupid rich lifestyle in an incredibly dangerous area. Because nothing bad happens to those people.

I forgot to mention the super street smart cowboy dude who is in on the lawyer's drug deal, despite seeming too smart to have anything to do with him. He is very confident in his ability to vanish without a trace when something bad happens, and when something bad happens he promptly shacks up at a posh London hotel and bangs a random girl, who was planted to steal information from him. But this guy is smart, right? Oh wait, he was hanging out with idiot lawyer boy... nevermind.

Ridley puts these four dumber-than-possible characters into a wild and crazy world where anyone can make a cameo appearance and not even have a point. Hey look, it's that guy from The Shield, and he's talking to some dude about a corpse in a barrel! Wow, profound. Oh, then there's the lawyer friend of the lawyer, who agrees to help him get his clueless wife back from the mob, only to lecture him about poetry and then excuse himself so he can go take a nap. Totally mind-blowing.

I was very happy to see most of the dumb people killed off or at least broken and left to their misery. I had to endure some of the worst dialogue and completely pointless scenes in order to get there, and to be honest it really wasn't worth it. But Ridley did an excellent job of making us all feel like smart people, because we're not doing incredibly stupid things and then whining for two hours while dangerous people put the smackdown on us. It's a good thing we have movies like this, to keep us in line. Maybe this should be an after school special.",1393459200,4,2546,4.42948717948718

5595403,5,B00BEIYRQA,"Does nobody remember how Blade Runner went down? Critically panned, only garnered it's lavish reputation afterward?

This film isn't Blade Runner, but it is directed by Ridley Scott, and capably. The source of the confusion (and low appreciation for this film) I think is the script by Cormac McCarthy. McCarthy came on many filmgoers radars for writing the books behind No Country For Old Men and The Road, both immensely enjoyable films and faithful adaptations.

But McCarthy has been writing for a very long time, and in very different moods. You can't help but notice (no doubt egged on I'm sure by misleading trailers) that The Counselor has a similar setting and premise to No Country, and if you set yourself expecting another white knuckle thriller like that movie, you'd be wrong. It's got some now trademark McCarthy inventive cruelty with regards to execution techniques, but there the similarity ends. Just as The Road was McCarthy's ruminations over life as a father, I feel as though The Counselor puzzles overs mens' relationships and fears about women, and doubt, especially surrounding the big decisions in our lives that we play ""what if"" games with later.

A few quibbles--the music is obnoxiously on the nose (castanets heard in an aerial shot of Mexico. Really? Just pick the most immediate association and go with it, I guess.) And Cameron Diaz mostly pulls off her character, certainly the look, but the final speech of the film gets lost tumbling out of her mouth. She is not one for delivering the sometimes arch McCarthy dialogue.

It's moody, it's surprisingly funny (Javier Bardem is a joy here) and it's vintage McCarthy. Do yourself a favor and approach the film with an open mind, and I think you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect No Country For Old Men 2--McCarthy doesn't repeat himself.",1393459200,21,1818,4.950819672131147

As a matter of fact they are all so stupid and self serving that you could care less what happens to any of them.
The bulk of the movie takes place in El Paso Texas, so they made a point of filming it in some lush exotic locale like southern Spain that looks absolutely nothing like the American southwest!

For everyone, whether they admit it or not, the world revolves around and consists solely of each individual's consciousness. When that consciousness ceases to exist, so does the world it existed in.

This movie has many levels to it. Some of them are great acting, directing, cinematography and editing. And that's in addition to it's multi-dimensional story of life.

I then began to tell them the books he's done that they would know, and the movies related to his works and they all got this sort of panic'd look on their faces.  I told them while they credits were rolling ""Cormac is a bitter old man who writes about the failure of good, and lessons that you can never escape from.""

The counselor couldn't leave it alone.  he already was doing well, but he had to go and stick his toe in the water.  Brad Pitt's character tried to warn him, but ""the counselor"" essentially ""took it under advisement"".  Something goes wrong through mere coincidence, and now for the next 45 minutes you watch people who are dead but don't know it yet trying to escape an inevitable and horrible fate at the hands of an incredibly cruel and ""final"" bureaucracy.

Good does NOT triumph.  Evil without question ""wins"".  I liked this movie, but it is so bleak that I don't know if I'll ever watch it again.  Before recommending this to anyone, I have to make an assessment of who I'm talking to as this is a very polarizing feature.

When the movie was over - I looked over at all my friend's faces.  they had that empty, emotional gut-punch look, mouth slightly open.  Cormac isn't for everyone.  I think you have to have a bit of a nihilistic streak to get into his work.  Blood Merridian, Outer Dark, Child of God, Sutree, the list goes on.  ""The Road"" had a glimmer of hope at the end.

I especially enjoyed the scene between the counselor and the jeweler in New Zealand when making the perfect diamond selection for his beloved (Penelope Cruz); these moments are rarely seen in film that I adore so much. I gave The Counselor five stars because I love superb story telling that's uniquely different, a little mystery that's intriguing enough not to insult my intelligence with cameos by great performers like Brad Pitt.

5595760,5,B00BEIYRQA,"20 minutes.

Watch twenty minutes of this film and then try to remember if you have ever seen a film with better dialogue. Then keep watching because it gets better. From the Jewish diamond dealer that randomly lays down a perspective on culture that is interesting at worst and revolutionary at best to the Mexican kingpin that oozes more wisdom than you can shake a stick at just before he takes a nap [if he has time]. Shoot, even the salutations between a bartender and a drunk on his way out the door having missed last call can be seen as profound. Classic Cormac, adjusted for the big screen.

Most importantly - and I urge you - do not heed the many, many 1-star ratings I have seen on this site. Or do as I did and read them as precisely the reason to watch this film... Seriously? Cormac's first attempt at a screenplay and it's ""boring"" or ""pointless"" What do you think? If you are one of the good ones, you will think that a 1-star rating for this film is less of an indictment for The Counselor and more of a vote from the author to hang an ""idiot"" sign around their own neck.

Watch 20 minutes. Watch the whole thing, then watch it again. There is no way that you got it all the first time.

Follow-up translations from 1-star reviews:

The plot never developed/""no"" plot  =  I couldn't follow the plot because I am incapable, for any number of reasons that do not reflect well upon me as a person or a connoisseur of movies.

I found myself asking What was going on/ It was confusing  =  They found themselves asking What was going on/ They were confused [no translation needed].

I can't believe all these actors and a great director would make something like this/ I expected more from Ridley Scott and Javier Bardum  =  I had an expectation that this cast and other well-regarded keystones would make this movie a little better than Dare Devil starring Ben Afflek, but it became offensive to me that so many great minds working on a project would make a movie that was sooooo good that it would push the boundaries of Hollywood and be slightly [or far] over my head.

There was too much waxing on about philosophy/ Dialogue was out-of-place and contrived  =  I can't wait for Fast and Furious 7; I hear Rhonda Rousey is going to be in that one.

I had to turn it off/ I couldn't get through the whole movie = I don't want to be forced to listen hard or think beyond myself for the promise of a big pay-off. A pay-off that would make it more likely that I would listen and think in the future.

The fact that there are brutal killings among the drug cartels in real life is a fact and you'd expect to see these things in a movie about the this subject. The movie however seems to realize that the audience may be falling asleep so a grisly killing is inserted every so often to keep the audience from doing so rather than as a way to tell a story.

3. The acting was understated and superb for that reason. I can be critical of actors who are stuck in that comfort money rut of doing the same over and over, but as one example Pitt showed me something new. Nuanced performances by all such that if you're not paying attention or you're lost it will all escape you.
4. The dialogue: Example, take the drug czar musing on life like a street hood who sits in on a 300 level college philosophy class then retells those deep learnings to his hoodies.

It's a dark and brutal fish-out-of-water story of a lawyer who tries his hand one time in the drug trade and discovers a heartless, unforgiving world for which he is not molded; McCarthy and Scott do a good job illuminating that.

5596337,2,B00BEIYRQA,"Ridley Scott directs a film based on a screenplay by Cormac McCarthy. Two names are attractive enough to draw such talented actors as Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt. Not only that; look carefully and you will see the supporting actors including Rubn Blades, Bruno Ganz, John Leguizamo, Rosie Perez, dgar Ramrez and Goran Vinji.

Unfortunately all these gifted players are wasted in The Counselor, an over-ambitious movie about dark sides of humanity. The simple story is about the eponymous Counselor (no name is mentioned) played by Michael Fassbender. He has a girlfriend named Laura (Penlope Cruz). It seems the Counselor gets involved with a drug deal that goes terribly wrong, leading to some terrible consequences.

Now, in The Counselor we see these terrible consequences themselves, but not the process to them. We know almost nothing about Fassbenders character and his deal. Javier Bardem fares slightly better as Reiner, the Counselors friend and entrepreneur. Diazs character is associated with a certain animal. They and other characters talk a lot about many things, which might have been interesting in books.

By the time you finish watching the film, you know what the film is all about, and that it is delivered not in a usual way. The problem is, perhaps film is not the right media for that.",1392768000,,1357,5.103603603603603

People who hate Brad Pitt will be happy to see his demise here.  I don't hate Pitt but I'm not sure what he and Javier Bardem are doing in this movie -- to their credit, they makes the most of what they are given and are the only reason I didn't give this one star.

This wasn't Ridley Scott's best, but it's still paced well and Scott's enormous bag of tricks learned throughout years of experience shows. The most prevalent complaint I've heard about this movie is that the 'story didn't make sense.' In fact the story makes sense so well that any lesser writer would've been accused of using a too simple of a 'story.' The story is in fact explained quite explicitly numerous times: greed. Greed is the constant theme throughout the movie; it is the impetus behind nearly all the characters actions, and it is the reason the characters suffer so harshly. (There's obviously many elegant complexities involved here too, but Greed has a black holes amount of gravity throughout this movie.) What the people I've heard talk about it are ostensibly referring to is the plot; and yes, the plot takes some thinkingbut mostly just to piece together how and when each character knows and came in contact with one another; and neither of these things are impossible to understand/learn, they just won't be spoon fed to you the way American cinema tends to do the vast majority of the time. If you're looking for a cookie cutter plot, with cliche'd dialogue of faux-machismo, then this movie ain't for ya.

The actors in this film are a who's who of Hollywood. Michael Fassbender plays the Counselor, an attorney who goes on the wrong side. Penelope Cruz his sexy, fianc&eacute;e/wife who knows not what he does. Javier Bardem, a high priced drug king who wears fancy, loud clothes, likes fast cars and women. Cameron Diaz is his fast woman for awhile, and she has the runaway part in this film. Brad Pitt, a world class drug dealer, who thinks he knows the score and knows how to play the game. This is a film about a drug deal gone bad, very bad, and the men who have nothing to lose, losing the big deal and on the run. The men after them, bad bad apples with no morals, their own values. A lot of messages in this film given via pontification from the actors. Long speeches about right and wrong, women and men and good and bad. Much of it written by Cormac McCarthy but lost in the overwrought wordiness.

I tried to like the film, and some parts were very good. However, when boredom sets in with the long speeches, it is a no go. Much could have been cut. Ridley Scott, the director, what was he thinking?

5596642,5,B00BEIYRQA,"OK, I know that puts me in the minority, but the story, directing and acting are all great imo.

So what's wrong with it?

Reading other reviews I think the hardest thing is to follow the plot. I pre-purchased the screenplay (because I'll read a birthday card if McCarthy wrote it). It's much easier to follow the story when you read it at your own pace, so when it came to the movie, there was almost no issue, though even then it's not clear to me why Malkina engineered a hijack that she didn't mind losing. I have to assume she was getting paid by the hijackers, and then she took the main swag from Westray, so she got paid twice (even though she didn't deliver on the hijack?). But it's hardly explained. I understand the extended cut is a bit easier to follow so I recommend watching that -- which I haven't, but I might yet.

The philosophy I thought was great. This is a morality tale -- don't get caught up in big drug deals to fund a fancy lifestyle, because you have no idea what you are going to be dealing with. To come out on top you'd better be amoral (immoral doesn't cut it) and very smart. All others perish. The counselor was warned multiple times, and he didn't listen. I thought the part about how we create our own worlds, and sometimes you make choices that preclude you ever returning to prior ones was phenomenal. Most pointed moral guideline -- ""Think of that next time you do a line."" Sure, they speak a bit more cleverly more of the time than most people do in real life. That's often the case in a story -- makes it more interesting than real life. I usually assume that they discuss who's doing the grocery shopping off camera.

As for the brutality, that's an essential part of the story too, and McCarthy didn't make it up. (OK, he made up the bolito -- but that's a good enough idea I can forgive him. Worth it to see Brad Pitt perish in agony -- which he did very well). But the snuff videos and the beheadings are everyday fare in the Mexican drug business. It's meant to be a  window on a world most of us can barely comprehend and would do well to stay away from.

Finally, it's funny -- often. Like when Reiner describes Malkina making out with his Ferrari, or the welders return the traveler in the truck, or Westray flirts with the honey trap at the check-in.

It's not for the squeamish. But McCarthy never is.",1392681600,24,2352,4.319727891156463

Also Cameron Diaz plays an interesting character but she really should not have had the role she did in the movie, she just does not fit into the character she is trying to display.",1392595200,,626,4.358974358974359

5596758,4,B00BEIYRQA,"There are many fine reviews that concisely express the idiosyncrasies of Cormac McCarthy's style, and the dynamics of a Scott / Mccarthy complitation far better than I, so this is not that. This is a layman's impression of a disturbing piece of art. Disturbing, as in why we came, and art, as in the most brilliant colors. Given art is in your eye; this movie is not for everyone. It was for me. I was left thinking about it, moving the pieces around to find hidden combinations, unlocking revelations. My grandfather, at 95, said to me "" You know why I lived so long? I have been Very Careful..."" Now that is deep, and the characters in this story exist on the edge of the line between too much and not enough. "" When you cease to exist, this World you have created also ceases to exist. ""

While the general package was what I have been waiting for from Hollywood for months, it does suffer from a common problem that many films seem to share lately; bad audio fidelity. As a consequence, it is hard to get the intricate details in every word of dialogue, and that is a MUST to stay connected to the plot. Yes, there is a very well defined plot, but it is elusive enough without having to strain to make out what was said. I hate subtitles, so that's why 4 stars. We don't all have noise cancelling home theaters, so PLEASE MIX THE AUDIO FOR AVERAGE TV!!! But I think the second viewing ( that's right, hardley ever! ) will be with subtitles, then perhaps I may even search for the book. The story is very intriguing, the cast is among the finest working today, and the logistics of production are wonderful, aforementioned sound problem aside. In short, not for the ""RED"" crowd, but if you have ever postulated the consequences of a temptation you did not succumb to, then be prepared to take a trip with the Ghost of What Might Be - if you are not Very Careful...",1392595200,,1867,4.380403458213256

5596810,5,B00BEIYRQA,"Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy--how could they do any better? Great visual sense as always for a deeply disturbing modernist narrative. A sophisticated yet naive attorney gets greedy, or overspends. His foray into the world of drug smuggling involving the cartels to make one big score leads predictably to disaster.  And gives McCarthy another chance to create a completely amoral character, Cameron Diaz's Malkina, who we are encouraged to believe wears the true face of the the universe.

The all star cast buys into the synergy of the director and screen writer's vision and strong performances abound--esp Michael Fassbinder as the counselor who resists good advice at every turn to stay out of a world he knows nothing about. Each actor delivers a nuanced sense of what decadence and greed does to humans whether driving a Maybach  or being turned on by cheetahs who catch and eat jack rabbits in the desert. Less strong are the somewhat stilted ""philosophical"" soliloquies delivered by those already staring into the abyss, but that's McCarthy being McCarthy, whether you believe his sample of humanity is sliced thick enough to generalize about life as we don't know it or not.

5597112,1,B00BEIYRQA,"You know, I consider myself a pretty reasonable movie watcher.  I like to form my own opinion, give a movie a blank slate and then decide it's value based on my perceptions.

I have never seen a bigger pile of excrement in my life.  I'm mean I have seen B-Movies that were better than this piece of junk and Ridley Scott should be ashamed of himself for Producing and Directing this garbage!

I WANT A PERSONAL CHECK FROM RIDLEY SCOTT REIMBURSING MY $5.99!!!

I'm not going to waste a lot of your time but here is a summary of significant lowlights:

1 - You are immediately thrown into an oral sex seen between Fassbender and Cruz and we have no idea what the heck is going on.

2 - Every single bit of dialouge (I guess you can call it dialouge) is a philosophical 5 minute speech by each actor to where you don't know what they are talking about.  It was like it was built into each of their lines to where they were trying to impress us with their ability to memorize a script.

3 - There was absolutely ZERO plot development.  I swear I was into the movie 30 minutes and I still had no idea what the hell was going on, who was the bad guy, who was the good guy, was there a cop? I don't know.  Somehow Fassbender has involved himself into a drug deal to get himself out of debt.  Oh and by the way, Fassbender has the cash on hand to fly himself to Amsterdam to meet with a Diamond Cutter and buys a flawless 3.9 carat diamond for Cruz.  I guess they didn't have any decent diamonds in Texas.  He meets with Bardim who I assume is the dealer?  Bardim who is involved with Diaz is a club owner who is also going into business with Fassbender, I think?  Brad Pitt is some Cowboy dude who is brokering the drugs from Fassbender to get the from Mexico to Chicago in the back of a sewage truck (that apparantly has DOT permission to cross the Border from Mexico to Chicago?)  Oh my god it just gets worse and worse....

4 - Scott did an absolute horrible job tying anything together.  I'm sure when they all sat down at the initial screening, Ridley and his gang of cronies were patting themselves on the back for scoring such a large cast of A-listers that there was no way this moving was going to be a flop.  GUESS WHAT???  This movie sucked and you should be ashamed of yourselves.

And finally, throughout the whole movie the Director just assumes we know what is going on.  Then to tie it up in a supposedly neat little bow...Diaz starts having everybody whacked.  First Bardim, then Cruz, then Pitt and in the very last seen she meets with her Banker in London and moves all the cash from the drug deal to Hong Kong and goes into some long story about her being the hunter.

The only thing more shocking about this movie is the fact that a few people here actually posted positive reviews! I counted about 4 of them, that is 4 too many ,

I don't understand how a single person , not even one out of a million would actually have something positive to say about anything in this movie,

I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I strongly believe the four people who posted reviews over 1 star are at least one of the following:

1) Relatives or associates of the cast
2) Under the influence of Schedule 1 and/or 2 Drugs
3) Have just been released from prison after serving over 5 years in solitary and this happened to be the first movie they watched immediately after release
4) Have been cast away on a deserted island and after being found my a luxury cruise liner and placed in a 5 star sweet had this movie played for them on  a 100 inch LED screen

5597290,3,B00BEIYRQA,"For those Cormac McCarthy fans this film will probably be disappointing. Cormac's novels bask in run-on sentences, philosophical tangents and just smart ideas while they accompany the well-paced story. This, however, is a straight screenplay, not an adaptation of one of his books, and therein lies the problem. If sitting still through endless conversations about grief, the meaning of life, the impact of loss on the human soul etc entertain you, then you'll love this very slow film. If that kind of thematic dialogue calls attention to itself purely for the sake of `profound thinking', then perhaps you will be disappointed with a film packed with excellent actors but lacking a credible story. Examples of seated dialogue: 'I suspect that we are ill-formed for the path we have chosen. Ill-formed and ill-prepared. We would like to draw a veil over all the blood and terror that have brought us to this place. It is our faintness of heart that would close our eyes to all of that, but in so doing it makes of it our destiny... But nothing is crueler than a coward, and the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.' And more: `When it comes to grief, the normal rules of wealth do not apply. Because grief transcends value. A man would give entire nations to lift grief off his heart and yet, you cannot buy anything with grief, because grief is worthless.' When isolated and read (as in McCarthy's fine books) it works well, but place these words as a substitute for dialogue and it pretty much crashes and burns.

The region is the El Paso/Suarez border. A rich and successful lawyer, the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), is about to get married to his fiance Laura (Penlope Cruz) but soon becomes entangled in a complex drug plot with a middle-man known as Westray (Brad Pitt). The plan ends up taking a horrible twist and he must protect himself and his soon to be bride as the truth of the drug business is uncovered and targets are eliminated. The other characters who walk on and off the set include a diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), a wealthy questionably legal dealer Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his all important mistress Malkina (Cameron Diaz), the jailed mother (Rosie Perez) of a druggie biker (Richard Cabral) - but they all have so little to do with what's going on (whatever that is) that they remain interesting cameos.

5597367,4,B00BEIYRQA,"I've been a Cormac McCarthy fan for years; when his screenplay for THE COUNSELOR first came available, I immediately snatched a copy and read it in a couple of sittings.  I knew pretty much right away what I was getting into, of course; and I could also see how it might not translate accurately to the screen.

Well, it translates pretty well.  The thing is, this is more of a filmed literary work than a movie.  Aside from a few flourishes from the supporting cast (a couple good scenes with Penelope Cruz, Brad Pitt doing his reliable Brad Pitt thing), the only actor who flexes much muscle here is Michael Fassbender (and he is utterly superb).  That's because THE COUNSELOR is more concerned with ideas: corruption, greed, collateral damage.  It's a conceptual and spiritual sequel to McCarthy's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (you're probably more familiar with the Coen Brothers' film adaptation, though you should check out the novel, easily McCarthy's most accessible).  This film follows a nameless attorney's downward spiral into the crime world, where must face an unanswerable paradox: what do you do with a coincidence, in a world without coincidences?

THE COUNSELOR starts slow, but gradually builds itself toward something resembling a plot.  Ridley Scott's direction is mostly sound, though his casting decisions are questionable.  Granted, there's not a lot Cameron Diaz could've done with her role (it's mostly allegorical), but one can't help but feel she's miscast (she's also not too great with McCarthy's dialogue).  The same goes for Javier Bardem, who at least still makes an effort.  Actor-wise, this is Fassbender's film, and he delivers a stellar, nuanced performance.  But ultimately, of course, this film belongs to Cormac McCarthy.  Be forewarned: that may not be what you're expecting or looking for.  It's a dark, violent world, filled with allegory, shifting morality, intrigue, and blood.  It's a world built around the brutal, misogynistic characters that inhabit it.  THE COUNSELOR, for many reasons, is not an easy film to watch.  But worth it?  That's up to you to decide.",1392076800,5,2104,5.099415204678363

5597372,3,B00BEIYRQA,"I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the theatrical and extended cuts.

The Extended Cut runs roughly 21 minutes longer than the Theatrical Cut.  Most of the extra time comes from extended dialogue, although there are one or two new minor scenes.

SPOILERS follow so read at your own risk.

1)  The opening scene between the Counselor and Laura is a bit longer.

2)  More dialogue between the Counselor and the diamond dealer regarding the dealer's Semitic background.

3)  Longer conversation between Reiner and the Counselor regarding women and Clarissa.

4)  The Green Hornet buys dog food, sarcastically telling an onlooker that he eats it.  This scene seemed unnecessary, since the Green Hornet was more interesting as a mysterious character.

5)  At the nightclub, Reiner relates a story about Peterson's Brazilian cousin to the Counselor.

6)  The Malkina-car-scene is described in a little more detail/slightly longer.

7)  New scene where Laura calls Malkina to tell her about a dream she had.

8)  Wounded Cartel faux cop asks for medical help at the junkyard.

9)  Malkina and Reiner's cheetahs wander over to a random family's swimming pool.

10)  Longer conversation between the Counselor and Jefe.

11)  New scene where paramedics pickup Westray's body post-bolito, and his head falls off.  Completely gratuitous and unnecessary scene, I think.

12)  Longer closing conversation between Malkina and her banker, and her stating an intention to flee to China.

The significantly longer Extended Cut primarily comprises extended conversations and a few unnecessary new scenes.  Beautifully shot movie, but I think that most of its symbolism was lost on me unfortunately.",1391990400,79,1706,5.324528301886793

Remains to be seen on whom. Or when we know that the coveted item is hidden in the motor cyclist's helmet, we know that somebody wants to obtain that helmet. That kind of predictability. It doesn't bother to stretch much into explaining who is who. Poetry of evil? Questionable.
 Some strong sequences and a great cast. Big surprise to me: Cameron Diaz as the bad guy. She does it much better than I expected, and made me forget her stupid romances and comedies. Well, maybe I just like her steely eyes version better than the sentimental grin that seemed to be her natural style. Fassbender plays Fassbender, and Pitt plays Pitt. Bardem this time gets to be a fool. He can do anything.
Not a good film, but it has some entertainment value.

5597413,5,B00BEIYRQA,"I enjoy Ridley Scott's movies because he always strives to make them meaningful - even more so, lately. But I especially wanted to see this one because of its poor reviews and critique that it is ""wordy.""

People: books have even *more* words than movies, but we still read them - even appreciate them, despite all those words!

It is strange that such critics of this movie - or those that simply expected a more conventional ""action""-to-word-count-ratio (?) fail to realize that a critique is only meaningful if it asserts that the artist failed in some unintentional way. Saying this movie is mediocre because it is ""wordy"" is like saying a book is not worth reading because it is long. That is what the artist intended! Critics that complain in such superficial ways are offering a critique of their own value as a critic, not the work itself. ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all,"" didn't quite get it right. What grandma should have advised us instead is, ""If what you're going to say isn't nice, make sure you put at least as much effort into verifying your opinion is fully informed - and if you don't want to put that effort into your speech, then don't clutter the conversation with lazy opinions!""

How's that for wordy?

This movie is great. If you haven't seen it, you should see it. If you don't like it because it is hard to understand all of it, don't blame Ridley Scott. Either put more effort into listening to what apparently intelligent people have to say, or else accept that you prefer self-deception.

That's partly a theme of this movie. But there are many themes. As with any quality piece of art, Ridley has done an excellent job weaving a rich tale with plenty to consider. I only wish we had more movies like this one.",1391817600,6,1777,4.5754716981132075

5597491,3,B00BEIYRQA,"It's difficult to rate this film. I wouldn't say it's awful. But the script is an endless diatribe of philosophy from every character with whom the Counselor is concerned with. None of the characters are well-rounded, just thrown onto the palette. And we just don't care about any of them. Fassbender cruises through this, we just don't feel his pain until the end when he breaks down and even then, do we know why he needed this deal? He didn't seem to be poor. Diaz is woefully out of her depth here. We don't care about her either. She is the catalyst for the deal gone wrong...like she needs more money. We don't know anything about her occupation, her income, why she would let her boyfriend get killed, why she is so hateful and care-free.
Arrrgggh I just didn't feel anything about anything with this film. And there are some random scenes...the biker talking about his dog-biscuits???? I mean what???
Rosie Perez...her small scene, pivotal or not, gave no push. Visually of course, stunning as you'd expect from Scott. Clearly he's enamored with McCarthy, read a script that played out as eloquent wordmanship, but forgot to apply any suspense or empathy...these are critical no?
I've watched this twice because I want to like it. Scott's films have their own trademarks that I enjoy even with the volume down. Like Prometheus, we were anticipating something truly wunderkind but got an episode of Deep Space Nine; hanging off flimsy and pretentious philosophy...again lacking strong characters and suspense.
Perhaps jumping from one project to the other has clouded Scott's judgement. I'd love to have seen what he would have done with No Country For Old Men, but that was perfect anyway. And now he wants to revisit Bladerunner? Why?
Exodus next, a film of biblical proportions. Let's hope he doesn't rush that one.",1391126400,,1825,4.890322580645162

This is one of those bad movies that yields solid box office projections based on Hollywood's precious motion picture marketing data. (sex, drugs, violence... sold!!!). Boycott it, don't spend a nickel...  It sucks.
Bad story line, chock full of ridiculous innuendo, horrendous acting (Hello...! Cameron Diaz?).
The main dude, Michael Fassbender, couldn't have sounded more ridiculous, with his made-up, low, ruddy voice. A far cry from what he sounded like in Prometheus. It actually drove me out of the theater. Dude, you sound like a moron, and your performance... robotic.
'Brand' Pitt, well... nothing he's done as of late impresses. It's like he's going through the motions on this one. Just plug him into a bland movie. Eye candy for the ladies.
Oh Javier... You're so much better than that. They made you up like a clown, and the performance, while it was somewhat humorous and a little over the top..., it fit right into a very dumb story line. Check with your agent.
Cameron Diaz...? Well, I should have known better. 'Nuff said.

The very first scene started with very vulgar language and sexual content, which I am not objecting, but it was a very raw opening scene that I guess was trying to set up how intense and love struck the Counselor's and Lara's relationship was. This movie is VERY DIALOGUE HEAVY, I found the film pretty much bland and boring, not because of the story, but because of how it was shown and played out. There are a lot of GOOD scenes and acting but it's destroyed by whatever direction director Ridley Scott was trying to achieve, I appreciated the script and language of it, but it's a waste of time and effort to sit through, let alone care about these characters. Amazing talent and actors but I never really cared for any of these characters, and I couldn't even sit through the whole thing in one sitting, I watched half and continued it the next day.

5597545,5,B00BEIYRQA,"Head's up, i have only seen the uncut version so the review reflects that.
It's not for everyone i suppose. But definitely made to my liking.
Cormac McCarthy's writing is amazing, the cast is amazing, most negative reviews you'll notice are from folks who squeal, ""it didn't make sense!"" or, ""if i wanted to watch people talk philosophy for two hours....""
""No Country for Old Men"" moves with a similarly weird and halting pace. In this film, the focus is on particular moments in time rather than your typical plot point by plot point film. There's a sense of impending doom from the start, and doom certainly does arrive. The story is not easily spelled out, so if you're looking to entertain yourself look elsewhere. This movie leaves you to form your own conclusions about the details. Not everyone wants a brain work out from a movie.
But what a work out this movie gives!!!! It's at times hilarious, fascinating, thoughtful and filled with horror. There are fates worse then death and ACTUAL character development. Don't be offended when a film asks you to use your imagination a bit. The two, (a good film, and imagination) can be a beautiful thing in tandem.
If you like ""the sunset limited"" check this out.
Honestly i'm a little astonished by all the negative reviews.
I guess when ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" comes away with a higher rating than ""The Master,"" or ""Synechdoche New York, New York,"" it makes me think of the conversation the counselor has with the diamond seller: ""the heart of any culture is to be found in the nature of the hero. Who is that man who is revered?""
Well. If any of the above paragraph made sense to you, this is basically an existential thriller based on greed, choices, and consequences.

5597551,4,B00BEIYRQA,"Cormac McCarthy is not for everyone.

His books hit like a brick to the stomach, and are just about as dense. He says *to hell* to grammar and punctuation. Because who needs commas when 17 uses of ""and"" will do? Why make 12 little sentences when one large one will do? Why make your characters speak normally when they can converse in existential soliloquies? Heck, why name your characters at all?

In spite of this, he is probably the most influential author alive, and one of the most divisive. His sentences can make a grown man weep, laugh, and disturbed...frequently all at once. His characters are broadly drawn, vividly realized, and unforgettable. They inhabit a dark, morally ambiguous world where Argentine vixen go cheetah hunting in the Mexican desert, where people are decapitated by razor wire stretched across roads. This is The Counsellor, a divisive yet stunning look at the nature of greed, evil, and desperation, brought to vivid life by Ridley Scott and his brilliant cast. Welcome to the world of Cormac McCarthy.

Whether you want to be in this world, whether you agree with his grand themes, or can even put up with McCarthy's dense little gems of sentences depends on YOU. There is an equal chance that you will find The Counsellor slow, confusing, and difficult that you will find it thought-provoking, visually stunning, and lyrical. I urge you to watch it and make up your mind. Just know what you're going in for: this is not an thrill-packed action movie. This is a slow-burning, existential psychological thriller punctuated by moments of visceral violence and constructed of gorgeously rendered soliloquies by an excellent cast.

The Counsellor is bound to force you to make an opinion. You will either love this film...or not at all. Don't sit up a fence, and pick up a copy of this future cult-classic.

It's heavy stuff that will offend much of the audience, but the film, rightfully I believe, exposes the cruelty to which drug traffickers will go to protect their interests.

It is interesting that the actual antagonist never comes to the cartel's attention and, symbolically, represents Death.
