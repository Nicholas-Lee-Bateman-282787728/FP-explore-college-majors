Really wish Tatsunoko would buy back Speed Racer so the series can't crash and burn anymore than it already has.",1535241600,,269,4.74468085106383
8735933,1,B01690GTN6,"My 8 yo rented this from the library and I am in shock that the owners of the speed racer franchise would let this be produced and distributed. The story is bad, the animation is horrible and writing of the characters is just as bad.  Save yourself.",1504137600,,249,4.297872340425532
8735934,1,B01690GTN6,"I'm amazed. A stop motion cartoon would have been a better allocation of budget for this company. Even if looking for something to entertain your one-year-old, you can do better.",1468368000,2,178,4.966666666666667
