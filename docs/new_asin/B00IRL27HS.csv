6289808,4,B00IRL27HS,She has a good mix. Hard to find much that is challenging without being over the top.,1468540800,,85,4.0588235294117645

6289810,5,B00IRL27HS,"I have never before written a review, but I had to on this one.  What a FANTASTIC workout!  I am 47 years old and a consistent exerciser (i.e. four times a week, though in the last few years, the consistency has dropped somewhat due to academic demands).  I love and have used Kelsie Daniels' Steamin' Cardio from her Fit Prime era.  But I had to regretfully put in on hold as I simply couldn't manage some (not all) of her moves partly due to asthma and partly due to weight gain.  I decided to try this video because I needed something slower with weights and great music and a great instructor.  I thought:  ""This should be easy enough to get me started again; after all, it's for seniors.""  Well, the workout almost kicked my butt :-), working muscles I never ever knew I had.  I was washed in sweat and the next day, I was beyond sore.  Yet I only used 3-pound weights.  But I have to admit that I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THE EXERCISE!!!  The instructor is just incredibly entertaining and motivating and the music was a wonderful complement.  This is now my new go-to-video in order to get going again.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.  Don't let the target audience fool you one bit.  It is challenging.",1433289600,10,1199,4.406392694063927
6289811,5,B00IRL27HS,I thought this may be too light for me. I am 56 and exercise 6 days a week. It was great and not boring. It had stuff I have never seen before. the weight part was good too and you can pick and choose which ones you do,1427932800,7,218,3.5625
6289812,5,B00IRL27HS,I borrowed several exercise DVDs from the library for my mom so that she could pick her favorite. She loved this one so I ordered it for her for Christmas. I received it very quickly!,1422576000,5,183,4.257142857142857
6289813,5,B00IRL27HS,For a new exerciser or someone coming back to exercise this is the DVD for you. Sue Grant is great. She explains where you need to feeling the move and how to hold your body to do it correctly to avoid injury. She shows different levels so you can try it harder after you know what you are doing. This is safe exercise for those who want to move but do not want high levels of exercise.,1419897600,5,386,4.025974025974026
6289814,5,B00IRL27HS,After having knee replacement surgery in Feb. I found getting back into exercising a little difficult. I found this DVD with 3 different levels for mid to older adults. I started with the easiest way and am now working up to the middle. Very easy to do and the commentary it good.,1407542400,,280,4.403846153846154

8644782,3,B00IRL27HS,The video was to hard for my group. They sled not to do this video again. It was too long and too fast for them to follow comfortably.,1513555200,,134,3.8214285714285716
