7200750,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"I was very excited to show these films to my youngest child - some of my earliest and fondest Christmas memories are of making popcorn and sitting in the living room with my family to wait for the original Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to play on television.  Back then we had a small antenna-driven set, and the picture wasn't perfect but the film was enchanting.  It may feel more quaint now, but it's still a delight that looks great in the upgraded 1080p image from this set, and my son loved it.  The same is true for Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, which looks better than ever on this digitally remastered Blu-Ray image.  I've never been as fond of Frosty the Snowman  (which is done in fairly primitive hand-drawn animation rather than the trademark stop-motion that gives the Rudolph and Santa films their classic feel), and I don't think it or its sequel Frosty Returns have held up as well over the past few decades, but my son enjoyed watching it.

This would be an excellent early Christmas present for parents with young children - but don't wait until Christmas to give it or open it.  Each of the films in this set brings to vivid life the story of a classic Christmas carol: about the shiny-nosed Rudolph who saved a foggy Christmas; about Santa Claus, and how he came to deliver toys to all the good girls and boys; and about Frosty the Snowman, how he came to life and befriended a lonely boy.  I expect we'll watch Rudolph and Santa a few more times before the big day rolls around, and we'll be sure to hold on to them for future years.  One very nice feature of this package is its inclusion of a CD that contains several of the classic songs from the films, such as Burl Ives' ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Holly Jolly Christmas"" and Smoky Robinson singing ""Jingle Bells.""  I'm sure we'll be listening to that set a few times come December.

Having said all that, I'm surprised they didn't include the complete set of Rankin/Bass Christmas classics, and there are absolutely no extras on the Blu-Ray disks themselves.  The films look much better than they did on my old tv set or on the VHS copies we still own.  I never ended up buying the most recent DVD set, so I can't compare to that, but I am surprised they didn't include all the films that came on that one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudolph-the-Red-Nosed-Reindeer-Santa-Claus-Is-Comin-to-Town-Frosty-the-Snowman-Frosty-Returns-Mr-Magoo-s-Christmas-Carol-Little-Drummer-Boy-Cricket-on-the-Hearth/dp/B000R7G6JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer/Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town/Frosty the Snowman/Frosty Returns/Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol/Little Drummer Boy/Cricket on the Hearth</a>. They did include ""Frosty Returns"" on the ""Frosty the Snowman"" disk - but, frankly, I think that's the least interesting film in the set.  I also wish they'd included the other Rudolph film ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" or the other Santa film ""A Year without Santa"" - both included on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this/dp/B00004VVPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this</a>&nbsp;dvd.  There must be some extras they could have packed in here - some documentary about Rankin and Bass and their working process, for example.  Without something extra, it's hard to justify paying the premium for the Blu-Ray edition of an incomplete set of the ""Original Christmas Classics.""  While the included films look as good or better than ever, and I'm very happy to have this set, I'd prefer to be able to see them all.

5-stars for ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town""; 3-stars for ""Frosty"" and for this set; average = 4 stars",1289088000,8,3729,5.27027027027027
7200751,3,B00XVJ3MW0,"Disclaimer... I was approached by Classic Media and asked to review the Blu-ray set, which was provided at no cost.

""Executive Summary""... If you enjoyed these specials as a child, and want to see them again simply for nostalgia's sake, I don't think you'll be disappointed. With one exception, the transfers are excellent -- though whether the improvement wrought by an HD transfer will enhance your enjoyment is something only you can decide. I have a 60"" plasma display, so the improvement over SD is easy to see. If your display is under 50"" or you're not as critical a viewer, the SD version might suit you fine.

All the transfers are completely free of scratches, dirt, and other visual defects. Unfortunately, ""Rudolph"" appears to have been subjected to ""all the way to 11"" grain reduction, to the point where the image is on the soft side. (""Santa"" shows very fine, ""tight"" grain, and is noticeably sharper.)

Artistically, ""Rudolph"", ""Santa"", and ""Frosty"" are aimed strictly at the lowest common denominator -- a six-year-old child. There's nothing in them a child couldn't follow or understand -- and nothing an adult might appreciate (other than Paul Frees' performances in ""Santa""). ""Frosty"" is 24 minutes of numbing inanity. ""Frosty Returns"" is the exception. The humor shows a degree of wit, and the story is an environmental parable that conservative parents will likely detest.

Showing a special year after year doesn't make it a classic. ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"", genuine classics, were created to appeal to the adult tastes of those who made them. These specials were not. If you've never seen them, and are expecting a gem or two of children's programming, you might be disappointed.",1289001600,4,1745,5.027681660899654
7200752,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"I got this set yesterday as a free review copy, and just finished watching them today.  I was born at the end of the 1970's, so I have very strong memories of watching these movies every year on TV when I was a kid.  My strongest memories are of, ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" and, ""Frosty the Snowman.""  I remember seeing, ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,"" once or twice, but that one was hardly ever on TV (the Little Drummer boy was on more often than it was), but I did see it once or twice.  But my strongest memories are of Rudolph and Frosty.  I had never seen ""Frosty Returns"" until tonight.

All of them are good transfers to blu-ray, and all of them look good on our 46"" HD LCD -- they are still in their original ""full screen"" 1.33:1 aspect ratio, though.  The film was never ""shot"" with a camera, so they didn't have an original to go back to and do a wide-screen take from.  Also note, they didn't necessarily remaster the films, I don't think.  You can still see aspects of the claymation process used to make the films -- which I don't think is something which is easily remastered.  But they still look good.  The sound seems decent, but doesn't seem to be re-mixed or anything.

Overall, these are the films from my childhood memory, and I appreciate having them on Blu-Ray.  I think the transfer to Blu-Ray could have been done a little sharper, and I think the audio could have been boosted a bit, but with old claymation films, I am not entirely sure how they would go about fixing the visuals.  I am sure it can probably be done, but frankly, part of the charm of claymation is its slightly gritty visuals.  The films certainly looked worse than this when broadcast over analog TV in the 1980's.

Also, a nice bonus, which they don't advertise on the packaging, they include an audio CD of classic Christmas music in the set as well.  That was a nice surprise.

4 stars.",1288915200,2,1894,4.39367816091954
7200753,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"I give this 5 Stars because it's Rankin/Bass' Rudolph and Frosty and Santa Who's Comin' To Town... and NOT because these great shows are now available on BluRay!

Frosty the Snowman and Frosty Returns look somewhat sharper. This is, perhaps, because the were hand drawn animation, instead of stop motion animation?!?! It is noticeable that these two shows are clearer.

Rudolph and Santa Comin to Town look a wee bit sharper on BluRay vs. their DVD counterparts. Nothing to brag about, though! The remastered 2005 DVD release of Rudolph looks just as sharp and crisp as the BluRay... well, to me anyway!

If you're a die hard collector of Rankin/Bass movies and memorabilia, then why not purchase it? It'd make a nice addition to anyone's library! Or, if you don't have these enduring Holiday Classics and truly prefer BluRay over DVD then, once again, why not? (Just, maybe, wait until this set comes down in price a bit!) Plus, we all know that BluRay discs are more durable than DVDs.

Yet, my personal thoughts are like this... buy the DVD combo pack that has the seven shows (on Amazon it's ASIN: B000R7G6JA) and save yourself more than just a few dollars; plus, you'd be getting way more bang for your buck with seven shows instead of only four!!!

I personally don't think there's THAT MUCH of a difference to make anyone want to rush out and buy this new BluRay set!
I think the DVDs will do JUST FINE!!!!",1287878400,2,1413,4.658634538152611
7200754,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"I love these Christmas specials and the three included in this boxset are my absolute fave -- so how could I resist? I heart watching Rudolph, Frosty and Santa do their thing, especially in blu-ray! The quality is amazing and the colors are so vivid and bright. I think these classic scenes and characters look better than ever. I am already in the Christmas spirit thanks to this boxset and I can't wait to decorate my xmas tree!!",1287100800,2,431,4.538461538461538
7200755,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"I bought this for my cousins because I remembered watching these as a kid with their mother (my aunt) who told me how SHE had watched them as a kid.  These Christmas classics, along with A Christmas Story, and White Christmas are such a tradition in our family, and watching my cousins and their mom watch them for the first time really put me in the Holiday Spirit. I feel like nowadays every cartoon is dumbed down and politically correct. This hearkens to a time when Christmas was Christmas and classics were classics - and yet, it is in new technology form! I can't rave enough about how good it looks on blu-ray. What an invention! Break out the candycanes and the ornaments - Christmas Classics has arrived!!",1287014400,3,715,4.5859375
7200756,5,B00XVJ3MW0,I can't wait to get these Christmas classics on blu-ray! These are the movies you watch EVERY year (probably more than once) during the month of December.,1287014400,3,154,4.7407407407407405
7200757,3,B00XVJ3MW0,"Alright, so I got this collection in the mail today and popped all 3 movies in to see how the transfers look.

Overall, I'm fairly disappointed. I think Rudolph looks the least remastered. It might just be because the setting is so white but there's very little detail and often the lighting was inconsistant (though that's probably stuck in the original film). Santa Claus is Comin' to Town looks the best. There's lots of nice, vibrant colors in it. Frosty is somewhere in the middle. The audio is incredibly soft on all 3 and not really worth noting. I'd be very interested in a more professional review from someone who knows more about the original negatives and whatnot, but as for my eye-based review I'd give it an overall C-grade.

There are, of course, some improvements. I've yet to see a 1080p transfer that doesn't do any good, but, to be honest, I wish I had been able to resist and saved $30. At $15 I'd be satisfied, but not $30.

As for bonus features there aren't any except the not-so-classic ""Frosty Returns"" and a CD featuring a collection of favorite Christmas songs.

Here's the tracklist of the bonus audio CD:

01. Burl Ives - Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
02. Brenda Lee - Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree
03. Jackson 5 - Santa Claus is Coming to Town
04. Smokey Robinson & The Miracles - Jingle Bells
05. Jimmy Durante - Frosty the Snowman
06. Burl Ives - A Holly Jolly Christmas

7200759,1,B00XVJ3MW0,"The problem with these releases just coming out like water is that Rankin/Bass some years ago gave up there rights to these and there owned By SonyWonder who just drop them out there to make a buck. I could be wrong but was blu ray not meant to be something special,this means why don't they hunt down the original voices of those that are left and let them do audio commentary,that would be a real extra. I have also heard that in the rankin/bass vaults they have Video of all the artists doing the voices in the studio as the film was being made,that means we could see Burl ives doing all his voices live,why have these never been put on as part of the extras. I love these and one of the other reviewers was right why is the little druimmer boy and its sequel not placed on here. Blu ray has just turned into something that you throw old movies on and they have denegrated the system of blu ray to just being a money maker,take for instance the grinch blu ray,it is alwful if you have not seen it the colors do not match the grinch,s colors at all.lets get lu ray back on track for what it was meant to be,and don't buy any of this garbage on bklu ray until they get it right.

7200872,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"Pros:
-This product is a great value, featuring SEVEN Christmas movies! Even though not all of them are as strong as the others (in my opinion) there is so much value here that the less-than-stellar movies are just add-ons, in my eyes.
-Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer features a semi-rare scene (the Cornelius peppermint mine end-scene).
-Rudolph also fixes some color errors that were seen in previous editions of this collection (though iirc, Cornelius's clothes still flash green a couple of times.).
-Some pretty interesting trivia in the bonus features of Rudolph, Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and the original Frosty the Snowman.

Cons:
-2/3 of the aforementioned trivia bonus features are interlaced with footage of annoying kids answering questions about Christmas lol
-In some discs, Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town will improperly fade to black 2-3 times. If you receive one of these discs, call 1-888-223-4369 and the distributor will send you a replacement disc for free that fixes the errors!
-Some of the audio can be hard to hear at times.
-If you're interested, the Blu-Ray release of Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol has bonus features, while in this package the movie itself is almost treated as a bonus feature.
-To my knowledge, at least with Rudolph, previous DVD editions had tons of extras which (I think) could have easily been added into this package, especially seeing as they wouldn't take up much storage space on the disc due to their SD quality. I'm not sure if different versions of the Rudolph DVDs had different extras, but I'm sure they could have acquired the right to use the bonus features even if they had to use multiple releases as sources.",1502150400,2,1675,4.939716312056738

7200986,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"I remember these movies from the ""old days,"" and was happy to share them with my two granddaughters (4 years and 22-months) at Christmastime. They loved them. The four-year-old did ask, ""Is it almost over?"" while the Santa Claus movie still had some time left, but when I asked her if she wanted to turn it off and do something else, she said no.  Rudolph was, as always, a fetching character and the youngest girl later wanted to print out coloring-book pictures of Rudolph from the Internet.  The older girl, who had seen the Rudolph movie once before, was referring to the ""abominable snowman"" before he even appeared on screen--and, of course, I was thrilled that she could pronounce the ""big word,"" though the first-syllable may have been clipped a couple of times. <wink> She did find him to be a scary character, but when I asked her if he turns good at the end, she said, ""Yes, he puts a star on the Christmas tree,"" so the theme of redemption was definitely received. Will definitely re-view this next Christmas!",1482710400,3,1021,4.666666666666667

7201219,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"My family loves to watch movies together. There is just nothing more festive to me than making some popcorn and putting in a Christmas movie while I snuggle with my family. We all love Christmas movies but there's just nothing like the classics. It's just so nostalgic for me to watch the same movies I watched as a kid with my own children.

I think really young kids like Jax who is almost two have a harder time with claymation but my older two at six and seven have really come to appreciate them!

We recently watched all of The Original Christmas Classics together! The collectors edition set includes seven classics! We all had different favorites and it was interesting to talk to my kids after and see why they liked the ones they did. I have always loved Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer! There's just something magical about that guy!

We'll have to come up with a new family tradition on how to pick which one we watch first because this was the first time my older two had strong opinions on which to watch first!

Whether you are a Rudolph fan, Santa, Frosty or some of the less well known like The Little Drummer Boy, there's something for everyone on this two disc collection. There are even fun new special features for the family to enjoy. My kids liked Frosty Snowflake Surprises that reveal fun facts about Frosty you never knew before!

The Christmas Classics are a holiday tradition in my house that I cherish! This would make a wonderful stocking stuffer for your favorite family this year!

7201239,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"Ok, first of all, this 2015 Anniversary edition of the BLU-RAY set does indeed contain all SEVEN programs on Blu-ray, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, yes, including ""The Little Drummer Boy"". I bought this (not at Amazon, as they were out of stock), and WATCHED all seven.  They are:

1. Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer (1964, 47 minutes)
2. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town (1970, 51 minutes)
3. Frosty, The Snowman (1969, 25 minutes)
4. Frosty Returns (1992, 23 minutes)
5. Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962, 53 minutes)
6. The Little Drummer Boy (1968, 25 minutes)
7. Cricket On The Hearth (1967, 49 Minutes)

And YES, I encountered the same defect on ""Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town"" as others have found, the fade to black right in the middle of four scenes, with the first (at 8:31) and fourth (at 42:04) such errors being the most egregious.  This defect is NOT on the 2012 Blu-ray or prior DVDs of this show.  Other posters have provided a phone number where we can call for a POSSIBLE free replacement Blu-ray disc (888-223-4369, and it works! Though there was no replacement disc promised to me, just the possibility of one.).

[UPDATE - Dec. 15, 2015: I received the replacement disc yesterday, and played ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town,"" checking the four points where the problems had been. All of the problems are NOW eliminated from that  broadcast. This is literally a replacement disc, so it contains the other three items that were on the original, faulty disc, and those broadcasts appear to be exactly the same as before. ""The Little Drummer Boy"" continues to have just two chapters, as described below, and is the same as before in all other respects. The other two programs I only glanced through, but they appear to be exactly as described previously.]

Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol looks perfect, just brand-new, sharp, and clean-- couldn't be better, and yet it's the oldest of all the shows (1962).

The Little Drummer Boy is barely sharper than the DVD version, but it has had most dirt and artifacts removed (I compared it head-to-head with the DVD), so it is a substantial improvement.  However, it is VERY DISAPPOINTING in that, as with the DVD in prior years, they use a version that is NOT what we have always seen on TV.  The animals generally don't make noises in this version (as when the lamb is hit by the chariot and bleats in pain), and they use a male voice-over and not female narrator Greer Garson for one famous line (of hers, originally) near the end (when Aaron beholds the baby Jesus: ""And as Aaron looked at the babe, he thought it was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen"").  WHY??  The old commercial VHS tape contains the correct version . . .  For some reason, this broadcast of Drummer Boy only has two disc ""chapters"" in it, which is pointless, because the first chapter, of course, is at the absolute beginning, and the second chapter skips past the entire show to AFTER the closing credits, so this is really poorly done as to a simple matter.  The other programs all have reasonable chaptering-- every five to ten minutes, taking us to the beginnings of scenes.

Five of the other six programs look quite nice on my Hi-Definition TV, all five are sharp and colorful, but Magoo stands out far above the others in that it simply looks spectacular.  Drummer Boy has the weakest picture quality (of all seven), with the blandest coloring, and in the early-on graphics, I cannot read the year, which I know to be 1968, but it isn't sharp enough to read it as such. The show itself is reasonably sharp, but only slightly more so than its DVD version.

Oh yes, as to #7: ""Cricket on the Hearth"" is NOT ""Blu-ray"" OR high-definition!!  A RIP-OFF!  In fact, this is also the only program for which you will have to adjust your TV's aspect ratio to view it, as it does not automatically go to its original 4 x 3 while your TV set is set to 16 x 9, which all of the other six programs do. Moreover, the bit rate for this show varies between ONLY 2.1 Mbps and 6.8 Mbps-- mostly in the 3's and 4's-- LESS than most DVDs!!  (Whereas all of the other six programs have more typical Blu-ray bit rates averaging 17 - 22 Mbps, with ""Santa Claus is Coming To Town"" and ""Rudolph"" often up at 28-29 Mbps, averaging about 25 Mbps.)  Anyway, ""Cricket"" is certainly quite viewable, but there is nothing sharp or high-definition about it. It is not horribly soft-focus, it's just not particularly sharp or new-looking like the other programs.  Its artifacts were mostly cleaned up, it is colorful, but it somehow looks at least slightly less than it could.  I'm sure they used the very low bit rate in order to fit this program onto the disc, since they were squeezing 7 programs onto just two Blu-ray discs.

ALSO, in an update to this post prompted by a questioner, I have gone and listened to the entire song, ""Silver and Gold,"" on ""Rudolph,"" and yes, an audio error, which I researched afterward on the internet (to learn its history), DOES still exist on this 2015 anniversary version, per my own viewing. Basically, the word ""for"" is missing very early in the song, as in: ""Everybody wishes for silver and gold""-- except that the word ""for"" isn't there.  This same problem exists on this newest anniversary version, unfortunately, as it did in the prior BR (I own the 2012 Blu-ray as well, checked it yesterday, and this problem exists there, too).

In sum, for $20.00, this set is worth purchasing in order to have the 7 programs of content-- on Blu-ray in their best picture-quality ever-- despite the ""Cricket"" rip-off, the flaws introduced in this newest Blu-ray version of  ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,"" a flaw remaining on ""Rudolph,"" and the use of a version of ""Drummer Boy"" that is slightly different from what we have seen on television for 47 years and vs. the VHS version.",1448928000,224,5814,4.596711798839459

7201242,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"The review is for the set (technically speaking), not the programs on the discs, which are timeless classics which deserve the best presenation, possible.

I always enjoyed the set (and always hoped for an improvement with each upgrade), but the 2015 offering (the slipcover packaging with the red bow and UPC 037117042050) has 2 major defects in the presentation of ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" -- at both 8:29 and 42:05 into the program (mid-scene/dialogue), the program spontaneously fades to black for about a second, then returns to continue that scene.

I understand a fix may be in the works by DreamWorks/Classic Media in the form of a replacement disc, but we won't know anything further, until after the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

Feel free to follow the announcement at http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=18027 for all the latest news on disc replacement for those who are affected.",1448668800,8,897,5.215277777777778

7201248,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"""When Willie Comes Marching Home"" -- a dammed good story. This war movie has an unpredictable plot, with a lot of twists and turns. It never goes where you expect it to go at any given point. It's an exciting, adventurous movie, and really holds your attention.

Dan Daily is in top form in it, I think. In many of the movies where he's a song-and-dance man, he's not too interesting. But he gives a good, solid, dramatic performance here. The music, not a huge part of the movie, is good tunes -- not lame-o songs written specifically for the movie. ""Somebody Stole My Gal,"" ""You're In The Army Now,"" ""You've Got Me This Way (Whatta-Ya Gonna Do About It)"" by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer. Enjoyable.

""Up The River"" -- a comic, enjoyable prison/convict movie. Spencer Tracy and Warren Hymer are cons with a kind of like-hate relationship. (Tracy double-crosses Hymer at every opportunity.) They ""bust"" out of prison, get thrown back in, and then various other complications ensue. Ultimately, the focus of the movie is saving a nice girl and others from being robbed by confidence men. The plot is entertaining, and I personally liked the comic touches.

Warren Hymer usually plays a comic tough guy, as he does here, and I always enjoy him. (He can be seen to good effect in ""Meet John Doe,"" during the pretend baseball game.) Humphrey Bogart as a mere embryo is an inmate in love with the girl who must be saved from the con-men. He's good here, with less tough-guy edge than he would show later.

Worst part of the movie -- it's very chopped up with bits missing. It's from 1930, and the source material was not the greatest.

I think these are two very good, enjoyable movies, which I will watch more than once.

Being a Baby Boomer I grew up as many of us did, watching The Lone Ranger on T.V. I remember seeing The Lone Ranger movie at the drive in(remember them) and it was in color. What a time to be growing up. I feel bad that todays kids missed that time. Both of these movies are fantastic and should not be missed. Also, let me add this, these two movies are far superior to the 1981 and 2013 very disappointing remakes",1421798400,4,513,4.14

There are different songs, parts missing, and new parts added (like Hermie building a snowman version of his boss & punching it in the face!)  Also the character of Cornelius is changed and finds peppermint (rather than silver and gold) at the end of the story!  How they can advertise this as the ORIGINAL without being sued is beyond me!  Watching Rudolph was one of my daughter's and my favorite Christmas traditions.  We treated ourselves to the DVD as a present last year since our VCR tape was getting old.  We had already gotten rid of VCR tape.  We were shocked when we watched the DVD.  It felt like our Christmas memories had all been stolen.

There is no confusion or underlying story, it's just Christmas fun for the entire family.  The movies are in great shape both to look at and to listen to. It's great to hear the ""Heat Miser"" and ""Snow Miser"" singing and doing what they do.  Frosty's magic and Santa and Mrs. Claus showing us how Christmas came to be.  Just great fun and entertaining music for everyone.  These films need to be on hand, not just watched with commercials during the holiday season.  Enjoy them year round and introduce their wholesome goodness to new generations.",1420070400,,719,4.476923076923077

There's a sequal to Frosty that is just plain unwatchable. I feel sorry for making my kids watch it. It's got the voice of John Goodman as Frosty, and makes King Ralph look like gold.",1419724800,,315,4.266666666666667

But, like so many of us, I grew up with the replacement songs, and those are the songs I'm used to, so I can't stand watching this one at all.  DVDs were supposed to be so much better than VHS, but 90% of the time, the VHS is much better, both in movies and TV shows.  I'm going to convert all my VHS to DVD so that I can have the best of  both worlds.  THIS was a huge disappointment!",1419379200,4,524,3.7522935779816513

7201452,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"The DVD version is a 2 disc set, very nicely packaged. The old movies are very well done; the picture and the sound is wonderful. The DVD version includes 3 extra films that the Blu Ray doesn't, including Mr Magoo's Christmas.

But, I have a gripe, and that is, ""Why are there no captions or subtitles available???""

If you prefer or need subtitles/captions, perhaps look at the Blu Ray version.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Original-Christmas-Classics-Gift-Set-Blu-ray/dp/B00Q506YUY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set [Blu-ray</a>] I can't tell by looking whether the Blu Ray version has them or not.",1419206400,2,678,6.279569892473118

7201457,5,B00XVJ3MW0,It has the classics I remember as a kiddo.  There are two disks in two different cases.  My 3 year old liked frosty the snowman and frosty the snowman returns.,1418601600,,159,4.266666666666667
7201458,3,B00XVJ3MW0,"A little disappointed in this. I thought it was 4 separate disc. Rudolph, Santa Claus, Frosty, but it's several Christmas productions on two disc. The dvd's is NOT the original movies.  Burl Ives is not the person telling the Rudolph story and Frosty is not the Frosty the Snowman movie. Spend a little more and buy the individual disc. If your child or grandchild has seen movies on tv and like those they probably will not enjoy the movies on this dvd. My 2 yr old granddaughter kept asking for Frosty- I want Frosty. The story line and picture/images was not the same as the Frosty she saw on tv.",1418601600,9,599,4.445454545454545

7201466,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"First of all, buy the dvd. Dvd version comes with seven animated shows, over 3 hours of entertainment on two discs. Blu Ray only has 4 shows on disk.

Don't expect great sound, as these are older, but these are virtually fantastic. High quality Clay-mation and magoos Christmas is well animated.

Rated four stars because if you shop early, you can find it locally for cheaper. My local stores in West coast have it for around ten. Amazon now lists it for 15. Do some shopping and snag this. You won't be disappointed.",1418342400,,518,4.559139784946237

Furthermore, only Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and Santa Claus is Comin to Town have worked on my DVD's.  I don't know if this is a common problem or not but it is rather disappointing to have 2/7 of these Christmas movies actually play.",1418083200,2,387,4.347222222222222

7201498,1,B00XVJ3MW0,"I would steer clear of these ""classics"" as they are just far too old for kids these days to have any interest in. Our 2-yr old daughter has recently fallen in love with movies (Frozen, Alladin, Little Mermaid, Cinderella) and we wanted to use these Christmas Classics to teach her about Santa and Christmas, since this is the first year she will understand them. Unfortunately, these are just too old for her to take interest, and they couldn't keep her attention for more than 5 minutes. Fortunately they were only $15, so we will call that a loss.

We instead opted for ""Plan B,"" which was to get Polar Express, which is obviously much more modern. We were not sure if that would work as well, since it does focus on kids that are starting to doubt Santa, but wow was that a hit! Not only did she watch the entire movie, but she was talking about Santa the rest of the night.

If you want these classics just to have them before they disappear that may be one thing, but for the purpose of teaching about Santa and Christmas I would go for the Polar Express, it was much more fun (and being narrated by Tom Hanks doesn't hurt).",1415923200,,1129,4.371428571428571

7201528,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"What can you say - classic Lone Ranger with Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels!! One of those fun western movies we used to watch as a kid at the movies on a Saturday matinee.

I previously could only get these movies available from the UK so I was glad they were finally available (again) in the US and at a VERY reasonable price.  There are NO English Subtitles and NO extras, just the 2 movies. There are a few places where the color is a little bit off (but not bad), but hey, for the price, it's NOT BAD at all - the pictures are sharp and clear.  You'll see some familiar faces from the westerns.

The other reason I wanted to get this is because the Lone Ranger was filmed in Kanab, UT (where the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary is now located). So you can stand and visit a lot of the places where THIS movie was filmed. (over 200 movies & television shows have been filmed in Kanab, UT & they celebrate their film history every August with Western Legends Roundup.) (The Lost City of Gold was filmed in Old Tucson, so you can visit and see the places where this movie was filmed also.)

So if you want to see CLASSIC Lone Ranger, and a good Saturday afternoon western, this is a good DVD to buy. Grab your popcorn and enjoy.",1410566400,3,1228,4.230769230769231

7201561,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"To commemorate the golden anniversary (50th in 2014) of Rankin/Bass' Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, here's a review on all 7 Christmas classics that are on this one-of-a-kind DVD set! Rudolph was the start of something incredible, not only for Rankin/Bass, but for the whole world, in making long-lasting beloved holiday classics, in both glorious stop-motion animation and glorious hand-drawn animation. In sets like this, Rudolph contains the missing ""peppermint mine"" scene, which baffled me and my whole family upon seeing it the first time, but it doesn't contain the missing song Fame and Fortune as a bonus feature. I still have the 2005 version of this set to prove that point. Frosty the Snowman is Rankin/Bass' most popular 2D-animated holiday classic, but it wasn't the very first; Cricket on The Hearth, one of Charles Dickens' lesser-known Christmas stories, alongside A Christmas Tree, has that honor just 2 years before Frosty, even with a live-action wraparound by Danny Thomas, one of the founders of St. Jude's, alongside his daughter Marlo, who both star in this once-lost classic as Caleb and Bertha Plummer. Frosty had several sequels, and one of them has been in sets like this ever since the mid-1990's; Frosty Returns, by the Lee Mendelson/Bill Melendez studio, mixed with one of the composers of Rugrats, giving this classic a similar feel to the Peanuts specials, and sound and/or music to that of Rugrats. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town had recently been on ABC every year since 2005, instead of 1970 when it debuted, starring the recently-dearly-departed Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle alias Santa. It eventually had several beloved sequels of its own, one alongside Rudolph and Frosty (hence Christmas in July). The Little Drummer Boy takes place during the Very First Christmas, hence ""the real reason of the season"", if you know what I mean, and has joined the other 6 in this collection as beloved classics for generations. Its own sequel is owned by the WB, alongside more than 10 others. (Book 2 can only be found in the Warner Archive's Rankin/Bass Christmas Collection, also sold here on Amazon!) And now, the oldest golden oldie of the bunch, UPA's beloved hit and the very first animated holiday classic made for TV, Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol! Old Quincy Magoo had his Scrooge part in an actual Broadway play down pat (with real-life Broadway talents to boot), despite not acting horribly-nearsighted or others thinking of him as a maniac; but that's what makes this special so special, alongside Gerald McBoing-Boing actually speaking as Tiny Tim, and the famous ghost switcheroo; the spirits of Past and Present switch places here! Whether you grew up watching any or all 7 of these revered holiday gems, or you're just seeing them for the very first time, no home video collection should be without these! Seeing them uncut always pleases me and my family better than seeing them butchered with commercials, time-compression & missing scenes; the networks responsible should pay attention to us! DreamWorks and ClassicMedia recently rereleased this set on DVD AND Blu-ray, with all 7 specials on both formats, each as 2-disc sets, as of 2015, with a few new bonus features to boot; thus making The Little Drummer Boy and Cricket On The Hearth available on HD Blu-ray disc for the very first time!

Seeing Bogey at such a young age is something else; the interplay with Spencer Tracey is also unforgettable. And it's all directed by
the great master, John Ford. The other film, the raucous war comedy When Willie Comes Marching Home, is a real pleasure, with
a wonderful contrasts between the farcical domestic front against a mile-a-minute war adventure. Watching John Ford channel
Preston Sturges is indeed an unexpected pleasure. For Ford fans, this double bill is well worth it.",1392681600,,615,4.980582524271845

7201617,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"These days I guess we're all too jaded to watch the old classic Christmas specials. When I was a kid we used to measure the approach of Christmas with the arrival of these on TV. Nowadays, it's usually the modern Christmas movies, like the Jim Carrey version of the Grinch, for instance, that get shown.

The transfers to HD are not perfect, but they are pretty good. The last time I saw any of these was in standard definition TV, and so I've never seen any of these in such high resolution. You can see texture from the original animations you could never see when these used to air on TV. The audio is generally mediocre, but I'm guessing there's only so much that could be done about that.

If you're a child of the 60s - 80s, I think you'll find these a wonderful nostalgic reminder of a simpler time when entertainment wasn't so slick and base, and a nice way to continue the tradition with your kids.",1390003200,,907,4.3609467455621305

In fact, this disc only has 4 movies. The ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" is the only movie ""redone"" in bluray technology; ""Rudolph"" was not redone.
The other 2 movies about Frosty the Snowman don't do anything for me.
Never even thought that the BluRay edition would be short 3 movies from the DVD edition.",1389225600,3,459,4.476190476190476

I read some of the reviews and they were complaining about some minutia regarding the quality of the audio and video.  No offense but if you are studying this that intensely you are a little nuts.

This is a fun Christmas collection. It was never meant to be pristine in terms of audio/video quality.  You cannot turn a production like this into HD quality; it would be like transferring a cassette to CD and complaining that it is not CD quality.

This still has vintage charm. It has been remastered (colors seem brighter) and maybe some could complain about that (because it is not as authentic as it could be) but some people could complain about anything.",1388275200,,692,4.548387096774194

So I grabbed this copy thinking I'd averted the crisis and yet when we watched it, it was nothing like the quality of the CBS airing.... so disappointing. The images were dark, the colors were different and faded-- this clearly isn't the remastered version. When we've become used to the beautiful bright one, this one just is not very appealing to the eye watch at all.

7201696,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"This is a delightful 2-disk DVD collection of the favorites many of you have grown up with and watched with your children as they grew up.  Now, give them to your grandchildren in a set.  The set features:  Santa Claus is Coming to Town, The Little Drummer Boy, Mr. Magoos Christmas Carol, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, Cricket of the Hearth, and Frosty Returns.  This collection is a wonderful Christmas gift for your children and hours of viewing fun for the whole family.  These flicks average about 25  60 minutes each.  Read on to find out more about the classics included within this set. . .

Disk 1:
Santa Claus is Comin to Town!
This classic is told and sung by actor/dancer/entertainer Fred Astaire and includes the voices of Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn, and others.  The animals are adorable.  It features Baby Clause as he becomes Kris Kringle and grows to make the world a better place, despite the efforts of a mean Bergermeister Meisterberger.  It is a story about being kind and letting children enjoy being children.  Lots of music and singing with beautiful animation and colors.

The Little Drummer Boy
Famous actress Greer Garson tells the story of a young boy, traveling alone in the desert with his animals.  He is snatched up by a traveling showman to join his caravan.  When his family is killed by desert bandits, he decides he wants nothing more to do with humans.  He carries this hatred in his heart until, one night, he comes upon the Baby Jesus in the manger.  The boy discovers the need to release his hate as he looks upon the Babe and gives all he has to give in a prayer to save the life of his little lamb.  This is a very touching story.  Even as your reviewer writes it, there is a tear in her eyes. (sniff sniff).  The voice of Jose Ferrer is also included in this classic.  The messages include: a gift of love, from your heart, is more important than a gift of money; and, no one should carry hate in their heart.

Mr. Magoos Christmas Carol
This one started off a little annoying to me (loud and obnoxious) but quickly went into the actual story line, which is a parody on the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, The Christmas Carol.  Veteran actor Jim Backus is the voice of Mr. Magoo.  In case you have been on Planet X for the last thousand years, the story line involves a rich, greedy businessman who is visited by a former, deceased business partner (Jacob Marley) about the evils of greed.  Jacob announces the upcoming visit of 3 spirits (past, present, and future) in an attempt to save Scrooges hardened soul.  This musical, joyful feature is a heart-centered show to remind us all that the true meaning of Christmas is love, kindness, and sharing.  Voices include Morey Amsterdam, Jack Cassidy, Les Tremayne, and others you may recognize from the good old days.

Disk 2:
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
This flick is about an hour.  Burl Ives narrates and sings several songs.  This is the story of Rudolph being born different, with a blindingly red shiny nose.  Because he is different, he is ostracized by pretty much everyone, even though he can do the reindeer thing better than many.  We also have Herbie the Elf, who wants to be a Dentist and the Abominable Snow Monster, who actually has a reason for being so grouchy.  There is also the unforgettable Island of Misfit Toys, where unwanted, unloved toys go until someone wants them. (sniff sniff.  Honk.  Excuse me, had to blow my nose.  I still want the polka dot elephant.)  Many embedded messages here for your children:  Its ok to be different.  You can still contribute to society, maybe more than everyone realizes.  Treating someone like a misfit is mean and very wrong.

Cricket on the Hearth
This flick from 1967 is approximately 1 hour long.  It is introduced by veteran actor Danny Thomas (founder of St Judes Hospital for Children) and features Danny and his daughter, actress Marlo Thomas.  Veteran actor Roddy McDowell is the voice of the cricket.  In this story (English story I believe), a cricket on the heart is said to be good luck.  A cricket finds his way to the humble home of a single toy maker and his daughter and is invited to stay.  As life goes on, tragedy befalls the family, but the cricket stays with them and helps them through it all, while evil forces stir in the background.

Frosty the Snowman
This is a classic, coming in at about 25 minutes, and is narrated by veteran actor Jimmy Durante.  It is the colorful, song-filled story of a snowman who comes to life and plays with the children as he wants to get to the North Pole so he won't melt.

Frosty Returns
This is follow-on story with actor/comedian Jonathan Winters, and with actor/comedian John Goodman as Frosty, where most of the town has decided they don't want any more snow  except the friends of Frosty.  While practically everyone is busy spraying a chemical around to melt the snow away, Frosty shows the town how snow helps bring them together.  Although not the quality of the original Frosty the Snowman, it is still enjoyable.

As you can see from my reviews above, these features are not only entertaining, but provide an excellent opportunity to watch these features as a family, cuddled up with a pizza, and discuss some heavy-duty subjects (such as treating others with love and kindness).

This is an absolutely wonderful Christmas gift, and you still have time to grab it up! For the price, it is an amazing value.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to all.",1387065600,2,5470,4.63579604578564

You can't go wrong on this two DVD set of seven cartoons - 275+ minutes of clean family entertainment. I liked all of them and all brought back many good memories to me. The only one I had never seen before was ""Cricket on the Hearth"" and it is my least favorite of the seven.

Ah the classics. The Classics are always timeless. Like I said in my previous review of the DreamWorks holiday specials, why not download these from the web or stream them on Netflix? These are the classics. Yeah I know they play these on TV on the holidays all the time, but it's always a good thing to just play them when you want and not just when they decide to play them.

I know some of you work through all that and can't sit down with your kids and watch the classics so this is a much better option.

But here we are in 2013 and now we get to have the whole collection of classics in one DVD set. I love sharing these tales with my daughter now and feeling nostalgic about my own youth.

They've all been digitally remastered, to sharpen up the sound and colors, but they are the same movies you'll remember from your childhood.

7201722,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"THE CHRISTMAS CLASSICS BLU RAY is a set of two blu-ray discs that contain for animated Christmas television specials: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Comin to Town, Frosty the Snowman, and Frosty Returns.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer  first broadcast in 1964 and loosely based off of the 1949 song by Gene Autrey (which was based upon the original story that was written by the 1939 story by Robert L. May for Montgomery Ward), this stop-motion animated show has become a Christmas classic. The story is narrated by Burl Ives (as Sam the Snowman).  The special tells of how Rudolph was rejected by his friends and eventually saves Christmas. The special features many beloved characters that have become staples in pop culture: Hermey the Elf (he wants to be a dentist), the Abominable Snow Monster, the Island of Misfit Toys, and the miner Yukon Cornelius. In addition this special features songs such as Silver and Gold and Holly Jolly Christmas. Running time is 53 minutes.

Santa Claus is Comin to Town  first broadcast in 1970, this stop-motion animated special is an origin story about Santa Claus. It explains how a young man named Kris Kringle decided to get into the toy business and bring some joy to the children in Sombertown. Its not quite as memorable as some of the other stop-motion specials of the period. However, it is notable because its narrated by Fred Astaire and also features the vocal talent of Mickey Rooney.  Running time is 43 minutes.

Frosty the Snowman  first broadcast in 1969, this animated special is based upon the song of the same name. The special tells the story of how Frosty the Snowman came to life when the hat of a frustrated magician (Professor Hinkle) lands on his head. The special is narrated by Jimmy Durante. This is a regularly animated special. Running time is 30 minutes.

Frosty Returns  this animated special was first broadcast on tv in 1992. Other than the title character, the special has nothing in common with the 1969 special: Frosty looks and behaves completely different. The story is about how Frosty arrives to the town of Beansboro where Mr. Twitchell, a wealthy industrialist, has invented an aerosol spray that just melts snow away.  The original Frosty the Snowman actually had two official sequels (Frostys Winter Wonderland and Rudolph and Frostys Christmas in July). However, the company that made the original special (Rankin-Bass) was sold and various media networks own the rights to the specials they produced. CBS owns the rights to Frosty the Snowman and ABC owns the rights to the sequels. So, CBS made their own sequel, Frosty Returns to include with any DVD or Blu-rays they sold of Frosty the Snowman. The only thing worth mentioning about Frosty Returns is that it features John Goodman as the voice of Frosty and the voice of Jonathan Winters as the narrator.

The overall quality of these episodes is the same as if you were watching them on tv. However, the colors in the stop-motion specials seem to be more vibrant.

Overall, this is a good collection of Christmas specials that people of all ages will enjoy. Its great for viewing at Christmas-time whether with family and friends or just sitting out alone at home one night.

It should be noted this review is for the Blu-ray of THE CHRISTMAS CLASSICS COLLECTION. There is a DVD set out there and the DVD set actually has more three more specials on it.",1383609600,3,3411,4.838487972508591
7201723,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"I was provided a DVD Version of The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set for review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.

Every year, we look forward to the recording all of the Christmas classics on our DVR so my girls (now ages 3 and 6) can watch them.  They love Frosty the Snowman and Frosty Returns the most.  Having this set is perfect because we can now have those shows on hand without having to deal with the kids having to watch or fast forward through the commercials.  In addition, you also get the other popular Christmas classics like Rudolph and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town with a couple of extra, lesser-known shows thrown in.  The quality of the ""remastered"" classics still seems very dated, but that is most likely the original subject material.  This DVD set is just as good as the versions that are broadcast during the Holidays without having to deal with commercials or DVR space if you want to watch them over and over.

Included in the DVD version of this set are the following seven movies:
1. Frosty the Snowman
2. Frosty Returns
3. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
4. Santa Claus is Comin' to Town!
5. The Little Drummer Boy
6. Cricket on the Hearth
7. Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol

Overall, it is a nice set with decent quality for really old movies.  There are no commercials to deal with and it is great having all of these classics available in one place whenever you want to watch them.  If you are a fan of the these classic Christmas shows like we are, this is a nice set to have for the holidays.",1383091200,4,1563,4.395833333333333
7201724,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"Ever year you watch these on tv and it's almost unavoidable. So when I got these I expected the digital remastered products to be equal if not better.  In some retrospect,  it did live up to some of my expectations.

I think the best remastering was done on the Rudolph although judging by other reviews some would disagree and say Santa Claus special was better at the remastering. I expected the quality of the video to be more clear on some of the movies.  The one I was most disappointed with was Frosty.  It seemed so white that it just didn't give any depth and almost seemed to blend in to much at times.

The audio was more than adequate.  I had to turn up the volume just to check and see if there was any hissing noise but was pleasantly surprised that it was not there.

The one I received was the dvd which came only in two discs but you get 4 other movies which are not listed which are drummer boy, cricket on hearth,  mr magoo, and Frosty returns.

Of all of them,  I really liked Rudolph.  It's still my favorite and the color restoration on it really made all the colors so vibrant and it just made it look so modern.  I think these are still great classics and some of the reviews are a little harsh considering they are trying to restore very old movies.

I received this item for an honest review",1382918400,,1316,4.254032258064516
7201725,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"(NOTE: This review pertains to the DIGITALLY REMASTERED edition, not the ""earlier"" editions.)

Christmas is a time for nostalgia, and some sentimentality, right? It's a time when many of us break out our old DVDs (or even VIDEOTAPES!) of perennial Christmas favorites that we may have watched every year for decades. It may even be a time to share these with our children or grandchildren.

Well, even if we already have copies of these ""favorites,"" the digital remastering makes it well worth ""upgrading"" one's old copies.  ""Frosty the Snowman"" and ""Rudolph"" in particular are a VAST improvement over the previously-released, not-remastered editions.  The sound and video quality are excellent.

And this is a wonderful selection of ""favorites"": The Rankin/Bass studio classics are the heart of the collection, of course; but it also contains a welcome surprise: ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" which used to be shown every holiday season (and was the first animated holiday program ever produced specifically for television), but has gradually been ""forgotten"" by many viewers.  (But Jim Backus's growl as Scrooge, as well as the fact that Dickens' own text was mostly used---rather than the ""modernized"" English we often get in today's edition of ""Christmas Carol""---will make this a marvelous ""discovery"" for anyone who hasn't seen it.

Is there anything to criticize about this collection? Well, I suppose they could have included a third DVD with ""Bonus Features,"" etc., but the seven features included in this set are well worth the price. (And how many of us REALLY watch the Bonus Features, anyway?)

But of course, ""today's kids"" sometimes disparage stop-action features as ""old-fashioned."" (They haven't yet learned that it's the heartwarming STORY that really matters---not the number of pixels per square inch.)  For such young folks, you might also check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamworks-Holiday-Collection/dp/B00DS79HCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamworks Holiday Collection</a>, which includes 4 ""modern"" tales.",1382918400,4,2085,5.80983606557377
7201726,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"My grandkids are 5 and 7, and they were delighted with these THREE seasonal stories.

Frosty the Snowman
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
Santa Claus is Coming to Town

I thought that there were 7 stories, but not on this Blu-Ray set. But what really surprised me was that this Blu-Ray set looked more like what I would have watched on a 27"" TV set in the 60s or 70s with my kids. I expected crisper picture and sound. That said, it was nice to finally see them without commercials.

We gave these to my grandkids just before Christmas, and they enjoyed them, which surprised me since they were raised in an era of animation from Pixar and Dreamworks, They were glued to ""Dreamworks Holiday Collection,"" but not so with this one. My 5 year old grandson paid attention to Rudolph, but then left to play with his cars. Sure enough, the ""Cars"" video enthralled him.

The Original Christmas Classics was given to me to review. If you grew up with these, you'll enjoy them more than I did. But this review isn't about me.  If you have tots or young kids, I think they'll really enjoy these and they'll become THEIR classics.",1382832000,,1117,4.482758620689655
7201727,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"I've enjoyed these Christmas classics all my life. I'm 46 now, and I still watch them every holiday season.  This holiday, I really look forward to donating my DVD and VHS copies (yup, I've still got a VHS player too...) and pulling out this Blu-ray set to share with my family.

Until recently I didn't have a Blu-ray player and wondered what the fuss was about.  Now I know that it's not just the player, but also the recording on the disc that makes both the audio and the visual experience better with Blu-ray.  Having my Sony BD-185 player hooked up through a newer Onkyo AV receiver via HDMI works well for most things, but I was mightily impressed by The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set (Blu-ray), fed to my older 1080i plasma TV.

All of the content was originally shot for standard television formats, not widescreen.  All of the shows with the exception of 'Frosty Returns' have black on either side of the show to maintain the standard format on widescreen TVs.  I hardly noticed it, but it's worth mentioning for those who might expect these shows to expand to fit their entire screen (something that you can do in your TV's settings, but this will affect viewing the show and not in a good way).

WHAT IS ON THE DISCS?

On Disc 1 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town' never looked better!  Details I missed in the standard format popped out at me, and the grainy quality I've always known was part of the show before, is gone in Blu-ray.  Audio is excellent too, making this show new again.  I kept finding myself thinking 'Wow! They really did a nice job on this one.'  Running time for Disc 1: 51 minutes.

On Disc 2 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer' looked great too.  Since it's the same type of animation that was used in 'Santa Claus is Coming to Town', I expected it would and wasn't disappointed.  Colors are more brilliant; Rudolph's nose is very bright, and the overall sharpness and detail makes it a pleasure to watch.  Audio too, is excellent.

Also on Disc 2 is 'Frosty the Snowman' and 'Frosty Returns'.  I was really impressed with how much better 'Frosty the Snowman' looked.  Sharp lines, brighter colors, good audio and while obviously the original, very much 'anew' in my book.  Running Time for Disc 2: 100 Minutes

The reason I give this set a 4 out of 5 star rating is the addition to this disc of 'Frosty Returns'.  Not billed as one of the shows featured in the set, it appears to have been an afterthought to fill up space.

'Frosty Returns' was expanded from standard format to widescreen (something the others were not), which made it appear grainy and distorted. The show itself wasn't really a hit like the others, and seems poorly drawn by comparison.  It appeared to me that no attempt was made to improve this show, and in this Blu-ray gift set it just didn't fit!  I would have much rather seen another 'real' holiday classic instead of one that left me scratching my head wondering 'Why did they add THAT in there?'

CONCLUSION:

Other than 'Frosty Returns' which is a very small portion of this collection, The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set (Blu-ray) was totally enjoyable!  I'm very pleased with the digitally remastered holiday favorites I grew up with, looking so fresh and better than new.  I would recommend this collection to anyone, but wish that 'Frosty Returns' had been left off the set.

7201735,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"If you are looking for a group of Holiday Classics, this particular one has many of my favorites. It comes in a 2-disk set (in individual covers) in a beautiful box (perfect to give as a gift) and has all of the following shows:

Frosty the Snowman
Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer
Santa Clause is Coming to Town
The Little Drummer Boy
Cricket on the Hearth
Frosty Returns
and even Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol

In case you aren't aware, ""Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol"" was the first made for TV Christmas Animation in 1962. I was only ten when this program first aired ... and it has always been a favorite.

These are the TV specials we grew up with and this set makes an excellent choice for re-showing them to the next generation.

I am grateful to have received a complimentary set of these in order to watch them and prepare my review. They brought back many memories.",1382054400,,868,4.474683544303797
7201736,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"Rankin Bass has always been associated with animated Christmas specials and this set contains their most well known works. It also contains a horrible non Rankin Bass show.

Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. 5 out of 5: Rudolph the Red Nosed reindeer is the best and most genuinely classic of all the animated Christmas special. Rudolph blends an awesome combination of lovable characters, great narration from Burl Ives, a wonderful story, and some awesome songs, including Holly Jolly Christmas, my favorite Christmas song ever. Rudolph absolutely deserves its status as the longest running and hightest rated Christmas special. If you never watch any other animated Christmas special, at make sure to see Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer at least once. Set in ""Christmastown' Rudolph is also the most truly Christmasy of all the animated Christmas specials. A round of applause for Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. What an awesome show.

Frosty the Snowman: 5 out 5: Frosty the Snowman is a show that wonderfully captures the joy of imagination. And in sharp contrast to How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a show I started to fall out of favor with in high school and college and fell out of favor with completely once I was an adult, Frosty the Snowman passes the childhood to adulthood transition with flying colors. Frosty was a magical show for as a child and it's still just magical to watch it as an adult. If anything, I enjoy it even more as an adult because it carries a great nostalgic factor for me. Watching Frosty the Snowman brings me back so many wonderful memories of my childhood for me. I've always seen Frosty the Snowman as being a show about the joy of imagination.

Santa Claus is Coming to Town: 3 out of 5: Unlike Frosty and Rudolph, I didn't grow up watching Santa Claus is Coming to Town although I always loved the song Santa Claus is Coming to Town. I saw this show for the first time only a couple of years and I didn't particularly care for it. While I do like the idea of creating an origin story behind Santa Claus and found his character well portrayed and the story well developed, there are two issues that bugged me. 1. This show is a bit on the dark and edgy side for a children's special. Apparently, television airings of this show are often edited down to cut down some of these rough edges, Now, that's more an in issue about it being a children's show. For adult viewers, this isn't a problem. My bigger issue with this show is that it contains religious undertones on a few occasions. As an atheist and a secularist, I find this off putting. This show had a good idea behind and some good characters. Lose the religious undertones and this show gets a 4 out 5.

Frosty Returns: 0 out of 5: Note: Produced by CBS NOT Rankin Bass. This show SUCXS! The animation is terrible, the songs are dreadful, the show is boring, and I HATE that Frosty can live without his hat. Frosty being able to live without his hat is not only inconsistent with both the song and the original TV show, it also takes away the key element that gives Frosty his character. The character of Frosty is defined by the fact his magic hat gives him life and it really takes away from Frosty's character if he can live without his hat. A round of BOOOOOOOO! for this show.",1381968000,,3277,4.568027210884353
7201737,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"Remember the old tradition of taking a basket of homemade goodies to neighborhood families at Christmastime - a gift that was intended to celebrate family warmth and love especially during the holidays? Well, Expedited Warehouse has decided to reinstate that wonderful old tradition, but this time instead of carbs, they have reissued the Original Christmas Classics digitally remastered and upgraded to upgraded for Blu-ray.

This colorfully packaged set contains two DVDs that reinstate four classics to the throne of holiday popularity. The set contains the following originally made for television viewing classics: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (Burl Ives. 1964/65 min.), Santa Claus is Comin' to Town (Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney. 1970/55 min.), Frosty the Snowman (Jimmy Durante. 1969/30 min.) and Frosty Returns (Jonathan Winters. 1992/25 min.) The animation is as crisp and colorful as ever, showing the current dependence on CGI is really not as necessary as we have come to believe. These films are expertly made with fine soundtracks and the clarity of the films is excellent.

While these films were actually made for children, the entire family will enjoy recapturing moments of nostalgia while the very young ones see the little miracles that last and last. This is an excellent Christmas gift - but send it a little early to help foster a complete holiday feeling. Grady Harp, October 13",1381968000,,1404,5.31981981981982

They are just that the originals, just on a disk. The only issue I had was that my computer didn't recognize that there was anything on the disk and wanted to upload files onto the disk as if it was empty. But after playing with VLC I was able to access the main menu.  This could be an isolated instance but just be warned.

If you would ignore the disk not playing like a dvd it would easily get a 5/5, but having to jump through hoops to watch the movies take all the fun out of the experience.",1356307200,,666,4.076335877862595

7201882,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"""The Original Christmas Classics Gift Set"" is a collection of four Christmas specials on two Blu-Ray discs. This is a great way to share these with my family without waiting for them to be aired (with commercials and cuts) on network TV.

Overall the transfers to HD were quite good for ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"", and ""Frosty the Snowman"", with the exception being ""Frosty Returns"" (not my favorite anyway). The sound quality was decent enough on all of them, at least through my standard TV speakers.

We enjoyed seeing these on own schedule, in their restored and uncut entirety!

7201883,3,B00XVJ3MW0,"I bought this set with the notion that I could own these Christmas Classics in one set.  When I saw that they were available on Blu-Ray, I thought better yet.  Well, I must have had different or unrealistic expectations.  I agree that many people gush over the quality of Blu-Ray, myself among them.  It is pretty stunning - but mainly with newer movies like Avatar, which were made using the digital film-making or computer generated process. These Christmas Classics are obviously dated and were a pretty remarkable feat in terms of filmmaking at the time.  Couple this with the increasingly vivid digital television displays and what you have are obvious flaws.  For example, right when Fred Astaire begins narrating Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town - the strings that support his puppet are painfully obvious.  During one of the Penguin sequences, it's really bad.  The puppet strings were obviously ALWAYS there, but they are pretty apparent with the high quality of Blu Ray.  This is by no means anyones fault and for the purposes of this review - the makers of this Blu-Ray disc make no claims that these versions are ""digitally restored"" or the like.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  It seems however that through the advancement of digital video technology, these nuances could have easily been made much less obvious or eliminated altogther.  Just saying.  For me, it ruined a little bit of the magic.  I guess when I was watching this growing up in the 1970's, my old Tube Television also made these flaws much less obvious.  I have reconciled my opinion with the fact that these Classics are almost 50 years old in some cases - and that the imperfect technical issues are just part of watching or enjoying them as they originally appeared.  I guess that's what makes them Classics.  If you want these Classics in a nice box set (without any expectations that they're anything but) I would recommend buying them. If you're expecting flawless digitally restored versions - I'm not sure such a thing is available.  Hopefully, someday.  These Classics certainly deserve a digital makeover.",1355702400,,2100,4.88135593220339
7201884,5,B00XVJ3MW0,This is a must-have for any collection.  It has all the Christmas classics in one place.  We watch this every year!,1355616000,,115,4.428571428571429
7201885,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"It's hard to imagine that I first watched Rudolph nearly 50 years ago.  Back then, with only 2 or 3 channels on our black and white TV, nobody would have ever missed a Christmas special...something they waited all year to see.  The tradition carried on when my child was growing up, and now I'm watching classic Christmas specials with my grandchildren.

This set of four shows is a far cry above the grainy picture we used to watch, thanks to Blu-ray and high-definition television.  The colors are vibrant, the sound is clear, and overall they are a joy to watch.  I love hearing those long-ago voices of Burl Ives, Jimmy Durante, and Fred Astaire.

This set includes the oldest show, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Frosty the Snowman, and Frosty Returns...all must-see Christmas specials that teach good moral lessons about love, friendship, and kindness to others.  These are messages that our grandchildren aren't necessarily receiving in the new cartoons these days.  I suppose that's why people continue watching the old classics year after year.  They are timeless.

Even when my daughter was young, we still had to wait to catch the shows on TV, and more than once we were disappointed when we missed them.  That's what makes owning this set a joy.  I can plan sleepovers with my grandchildren, pop the popcorn, and put the movie in.  No commercials!  I also got the Blu-ray edition of Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol.  It's a favorite of my husband's, and I think he uses the grandchildren as his excuse to watch it every year.",1355616000,,1565,4.808988764044944
7201886,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"Taken as a collective, this is a great product. The sum of its parts probably exceeds these products individually.

Let's look at these releases individually:

""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" Four stars. Probably the best-remembered Rankin-Bass production, although not the best. Mean-spirited at times, and Rudolph's voice is the biggest negative (would have been much better with an actual child actor). Animation of speaking is clunky throughout, although I doubt that many people will care. So much nostalgia associated with this one, and the undertaking to animate it had to have been substantial.

""Frosty the Snowman."" Three stars. Many have mentioned that the cartoon was ruined with bad overdubbing added in later. Points off for that.

""Frosty Returns."" Two stars. Not a Christmas presentation, not a genuine sequel, not worth watching Also a much later release.

""Cricket on the Hearth."" A weak three stars. No wonder that this one isn't remembered as fondly. I'm sure that there are people out there who are nostalgic for it, but as many of these kinds of cartoons as I've seen through the years, I've never seen this one before. I found it to be full of potential, but meandering with a nonsensical plot. It can't figure out what exactly it is. The Christmas part of the story clearly was forced and doesn't fit in with any of the rest. Points for great animation and good voiceovers, though.

""The Little Drummer Boy."" Four stars. Also not remembered as well or as fondly as the other Rankin-Bass classics, I actually find this one to be one of the better examples. However, the original print is in the worst shape of all of them for some reason.

""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol."" Four stars. The original animated Christmas special. Wonderful animation, great story, beautiful songs. Obviously lovingly-produced. Much more low-key than what you'd probably expect, especially for an animated special (today's hyperactive children never would go for it).

""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town."" Four stars. The best of the Rankin-Bass animagic productions, in terms of animation, characterization, casting, acting and story. A few points off for some strange points shoehorned into the story (The first Christmas tree appeared at Santa Claus' wedding? Really? Unnecessary).",1355616000,,2281,5.1961852861035425

I was so excited to see that they put these together as I had been wanting to share them all with my own daughters, but have not been able to find them all on television.

There are a few shows that you might also attribute to this classic status that are not here such as Rudolph's Shiny New Year (which I thought would be here but it was not), but I cannot fault the developers too much on that as what you do get is worth the wait!

All of the shows are fun and bring out the holiday spirit in everyone. My kids and I sat down to watch these over the last few days and they loved them.

I did notice upon researching the DVD version of this that they had added another three Shows on that that were not here, which was a bit disappointing. However, the overall quality of the shows you do get are top notch and I was quite impressed with the digital remastering of the videos themselves and I believe that you will be as well!

She loves Frosty, is coming around to Santa Claus is Comin to Town, but is unable to watch Rudolph. It's not in the set! We received 3 discs in this set. Disc One has Frosty and Frosty Returns. Disc Two has Santa Claus is Comin to Town. Disc Three is CD, featuring songs, but no video data. I think it's supposed to play the movie or the  music, and maybe the video data is corrupted or something? Our player is newer, and the firmware was updated just 2 weeks ago, so I'm sure it's not that. We're disappointed, and hoping Amazon continues it's normally great customer service with this issue. 2 years after ordering the movie set, we're just discovering so that's a little late on our part- but we'll see.
The quality of the remaster is pretty nice. The picture is clear, and the sound is more crisp than I remember growing up! If we had Rudolph, I'd be much happier it would have been a way better value!

The price wasn't much more, so I ordered the 8 movies, but the options were very confusing. I even went back a few days later to double-check what I had ordered and I thought I had ordered just the 4 movies. Then my order came in and even on the movies themselves, I had to really look and figure out what I had ordered. Apparently I had ordered the 8 movies.

I was so excited to have this digitally restored collection on Blu-ray to share with my kids!  I grew up on these movies so I was thrilled to share the magic with them!

The collection includes ""Frosty the Snowman,"" ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and a bonus feature of ""Frosty Returns.""  I wasn't sure how my kids would respond to this completely different type of animation from what they are accustomed to but they loved it!  I think because it was so unique they were glued to the TV. They equally enjoyed the old style of animation in Rudolph and Santa Claus with the cartoon animation they are used to on Frosty.

I love watching holiday movies with my kids and the fact that they can appreciate the same movies as I did as a kid makes it even more special.  I must admit I was laughing a little bit at the Claymation; especially the abominable snowman in Rudolph but the beauty of childhood is they don't notice yet when things don't look quite real. If you have a sensitive child, things like the abominable snowman that were amusing to me might actually be scary for them.  I remember being a bit intimidated by him when I first watched this as a child.

I learned something new watching these that I didn't care about or appreciate as a child.  There are some pretty famous people that star in these movies!  Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney star in Santa Claus.  That makes it more special for me, even if my kids don't have a clue who they are!

From toddlers to teenagers to moms and dads, everyone will enjoy this great collection of Christmas classics.  Don't forget to put it on your list for all the movie lovers you know!",1354406400,,1812,4.484756097560975

They transferred well to Blu-ray even though I'm sure the original technology/quality was nothing like what blu-rays provide now.

7201914,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"My teenage daughter is learning stop motion animation, and Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer was one of her earliest influences in the field. We have watched these as a family every year since she was little.

The digital remasters are well done.
I'm especially impressed with Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer since it is the favorite for my whole family. The texture and coloring is wonderful and clear, the sound doesn't have any hisses or pops. I loved all the small details. Burt Ives voice is fantastic, and I do like the song We're a Couple of Misfits a lot better than Fame and Fortune. The moral message of acceptance and that there is a place for everyone still has universal appeal.

Frosty the Snowman, being animated, is recolored and cleaned up for brighter, clearer colors and lines. Again, the audio sounds good, and Durante's voice is still wonderful.

Frosty's Return doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the movies, but children will still enjoy it and the music.

Santa Claus is Comin' To Town is my second favorite Rankin/Bass Christmas special. It's also stop motion animated, and just looks wonderful in the remaster with nice details that didn't exist on the versions I grew up with on television.

There is a reason these are such classics and still aired every year. While a lot of things don't age well, these stories are still charming. The only thing that didn't age well for them was the film quality itself, and this repairs a lot of the visible and audible flaws in that. I'm glad we have them to watch on our own schedule around the holidays instead of waiting for the nights they air on television. The colors, clarity and clean look of the remasters is very well done, and it feels like for the first time I'm seeing them as they should be viewed.

For me some of the memories go back to watching the Christmas specials on TV that became the classics of all time and they never get old.

* Santa Claus is Coming to Town
* Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
* Frosty the Snowman
* And Frosty Returns

These have been re-mastered and put onto Blu-ray format and they are just wonderful.  They stories are told by many famous actors of my childhood and their voices bring back good memories.  Fred Astaire narrated Santa Claus is Coming to Town and voices include Mickey Rooney and Keenan Wynn.  Rudolph is told by Burl Ives and Frosty is told and sung by Jimmy Durante.

I wanted to see how much today's children would appreciate these wonderful stories so I watched them with my nine year old grandson and he thoroughly enjoyed them.  He told me that they should be rated 5 stars.  Stories like this are fun for children and they keep their imagination alive and growing.  It also puts them into the holiday spirit and they are just fun to watch.

For me I enjoyed watching them and the nostalgia and memories were fun to think about again.  Watching them with my grandson was a special time and it is something that both he and I will remember.

7201921,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"Every year about Christmas time I write a column about a favorite Christmas holiday film. I know you're all probably tired of hearing me extol the virtues and greatness of ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE but what can I say? How about something different this year?

For those of you who have finally joined the blu-ray revolution you can now own a great collection of some of your favorite Christmas classics on blu-ray. From ClassicMedia pick up THE ORIGINAL CHRISTMAS CLASSICS. This set includes for holiday favorites from the folks at Rankin-Bass, three of which I feel deserve to be called classics and a fourth included because it's a sequel.

On the low end you have FROSTY THE SNOWMAN, a fairly decent look at the character from the song about a snowman who comes to life when a magic hat is placed upon his head. I say low end because this is traditional TV animation here with a focus more on transforming a story into a modern setting and that almost never succeeds. It does so here but not completely. Rather than just have fun with Frosty only to see him melt away until next year we have a story of a despicable lame magician whose hat it was that made Frosty come to life. Wanting to keep the only successful piece of magic he has, he continues to pursue the hat while little girl Karen keeps trying to save Frosty by getting him to the North Pole. It's a cute movie that the kids will enjoy and parents can ignore.

The worst piece included here (sorry it's true) is FROSTY RETURNS. While the main character is the same the entire story and way it's told is far from festive. Frosty comes back but the problem this time around is an evil corporate inventor who has created a product that melts snow. This way folks don't have to shovel drives or deal with the white stuff, they can just spray it away. This movie is Christmas as seen through the eyes of the sixties protestors, out to save the environment and bring down the evil corporate giants who want to ruin things. In so doing they ruin the meaning of Christmas and create a cartoon that lacks anything worth watching.

On to the good...no the GREAT stuff. First off is SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. This is one of the animated puppet films that the Rankin-Bass studios were known for. It tells the whole story behind Santa Claus, how he got his name, why he wears red, how he got to the North Pole...almost anything any child could ever ask. If you've enjoyed this over the years you'll know who I'm talking about when I mention the bad guy's name, Burgermesiter Meisterberger.  His attempts to stop children from playing with toys is famous but so is Chris Kringle's ability to continue to deliver toys made by elves. While most kids and teens today will have no idea who Fred Astaire is, he narrates the entire thing with help from Mickey Rooney as Santa (yet another actor lost to this generation).

I've saved the best for last. This four film box set comes with the greatest of all Christmas time TV shows, even better than A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS or HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS. Those may be two and three on my list but how could anyone NOT love RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER? Once again the Rankin-Bass studios used animated puppets to tell the tale of a couple of misfits found in Rudolph with his glowing nose and his friend Hermy, the elf who wanted to be a dentist. Their adventures after leaving the North Pole and finding things like their friend Cornelius the gold digger, the Island of Misfit Toys and the terrible creature known as the abominable snowman later to be called the Bumble are legendary. At least to kids who grew up after the shows premiere back in 1964.

To this day kids watch this show on a yearly basis when it comes on TV. And while it's great to wait for that day it's even better to be able to watch a pristine version on your TV via blu-ray. The crisp colors and sharp focus make this show a treat for the eyes and the songs you've come to know and love make it one for the ears. It is a Christmas gift that you can enjoy whenever the mood strike this way. You may end up watching it more than during winter months!

There is a simple pleasure in waiting to watch your favorite shows as they play out in real time on television. And that can still happen. But it's also nice to know you can have these in your collection to watch when you want to, perhaps even on Christmas Eve before putting the kids to bed. It might even make them head there sooner so they can lay awake, to excited to sleep, waiting to hear the bells of Santa's sleigh with Rudolph in the lead. It might.",1332201600,,4582,4.401416765053129
7201922,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"Two of the greatest Christmas shows are included as well as a good one.  Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer is my favorite Christmas show save Charlie Brown and I enjoy watching it every year.  On blu-ray, it is nicely restored so that the colors are crisp and the sound is sharp.  The picture is formatted to the correct picture size and nothing is stretched out and distorted.  This show is so much fun to watch no matter what age you are.  A reindeer is rejected for having a defected nose only for everyone to realize it is an asset.
Frosty The Snowman is my 2nd favorite in the blu-ray set.  Frosty is also beautifully restored.  Frosty tries to help a girl named Sandy and plays with children until you know what happens.
Santa Claus is Comin to Town has never been my favorite Christmas show but it has its charms.  Especially Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney among other famous stars in the cast.  It's a sweet show but doesn't stand out like the other two do in my mind.  All in all a pretty nice set of blu-ray discs.",1331683200,,1021,4.354497354497354

I was skeptical buying this set as I wasn't sure there were actually 7 shows in the set but after reading several reviews this was the fact I went ahead and purchased the box set.

They used to come on TV every year around Christmas time and I'd stay up past my bedtime watching them. There was a magical quality about these animations and now you can pass this wonderful holiday tradition on to your kids, or relive those childhood memories.

For a new generation of audiences, they've now come to Blu-ray.. but only some of the animations. The DVD version contains 7 films but the Blu-ray edition only has 4 (Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and Frosty Returns). The first 3 films are the classics you know and love from the 1960's and 70's. They are in 1:1.33 format (you'll get black bars on the left and right side of your TV). The odd one out is Frosty Returns, which is not a Rankin/Bass film. I don't remember having seen this as a kid -- probably because it was not memorable or it was never aired to begin with. It's from 1992 and PQ is quite poor. It looks very muddy, blocky and pixelated, like an upscaled VHS tape. Frosty Returns is in widescreen, but owing to the poor video quality, it isn't an improvement in viewing experience. There are no special features on the discs. Just the movies.

For 40+ year old films, the picture quality is good, but not fantastic. On Frosty, for example, I can see a lot of digital enhancement artifacts. Some outlines have a fuzzy halo around them from the digital sharpening techniques used to enhance the film. But, it's the animations that really matter and your kids will never know the difference.

Missing from here is one additional holiday classic: The Little Drummer Boy. I wish it were included here instead of Frosty Returns.

7201973,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"I work at a store that is selling the dvd version of this set, for the same price Amazon has the blu ray for lol. I try to sell it though, not because I am in profit sharing, but because in today's holiday classics there is too much profanity, cynicism and an overall lack of family values. One customer said that she loved it but her child wouldn't want to watch it. I told her, that it is up to us to keep these traditions alive. Family values have gone away as far as holiday cartoons are concerned. Ironically, south park's christmas special was better than some of the other ones coming out. It seems that traditional family values are fading fast. Parents nowadays would rather be a child's friend, than a parent. You can still love your children and yet teach them at the same time. Kids learn from their parents, both behavior patterns, and also what the parent likes/dislikes. Granted, no child is going to like everything a parent does, that's never going to happen, but if you start them young and share with them traditional family cartoons such as these (and any of the Peanut's Specials) they will catch on. And, maybe also read to them the stories that you grew up with. Forget youtube and file sharing, we need to get back to basics. Today's family no longer eats at the same table, they get their music from the internet and store them in the cloud, they no longer talk to each other, they tex, they facebook, and email. With the holidays coming up, I would wish for everyone to just sit around and talk and share stories. Share the shows/movies from your childhood, and don't assume they are going to hate it. My friend's son started watching the Monkees' tv show with me as well as Elvis movies, now he loves them both, he's 12 now and is wholly invested in his ranking on Halo, but he still has been influenced by my generation. With Frosty and Rudolph and Santa, we can relive our childhood but at the same time enhance the lives of the children of today. There is a reason why Charles M. Shulz still makes about 30 million a year, even though he has passed on, and no longer writes his strip. It's because people still need to be reminded of how sweet and innocent life can be, and that no matter how hard life is, we still have the basics to go back to. Tales of frindship and loyalty and stories of how everyone is of value, and no one person is more special than another, are great stories to share with your kids, so that they may share with their kids some day. We need to make sure that classics such as this never fade away, as they are part of the basic american fabric. It is who we were, and who we are. So I highly recommend this set (unless you wish to purchase the titles individually) but each one is great (maybe frosty returns is a bit blah compared to the original but still not bad) they pack a lot in this set for the price. And I highly recommend getting it on blu ray. So sit back enjoy, and share...because classics such as these are not meant to fade away.",1322611200,,3001,4.33214920071048

7201976,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"On this three-disc boxed Blu-ray set, The Original Christmas Classics, you can see three of the top Christmas specials, produced and directed by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass, in high def -- plus get a music CD of original-version holiday pop hits like Brenda Lee' ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" and Burl Ives' Decca versions of ""Rudolph"" and ""Holly Jolly Christmas.""

[For some reason, the DVD version of the same set includes seven specials. The set of three Blu-ray discs contains four shows in total, and it's a better deal than buying the three Blu-ray discs separately.]

Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer is the first Rankin/Bass holiday special, and only their second TV special ever (the first being Return to Oz). Still the all-time champ, Rudolph is the longest-running holiday special in television history, running annually since 1964, mostly on CBS and NBC. You can get hung up on the modest scope of the stop-motion Animagic figures, elemental sets and limited effects, but you can't deny its power. There is simply an engaging quality about the production that charms every generation, regardless of how high-tech things become. Production designer Anthony Peters deserves more attention for his creations, which we see almost everywhere today -- even the lettering is widely imitated.

At its core, the story is about being ""different,"" and how those differences become strengths. For a show aimed at children's, the characters can be downright cruel (this particular Santa, besides appearing to have an eating disorder, shows such displeasure he'd be right at home sitting next to Donald Trump on The Apprentice).

If you view the special in its historic context, during the civil rights movement, suddenly Rudolph is a victim of prejudice -- Clarice's father won't let his daughter be seen with him. Maybe that's reading too much into the story, but it makes one wonder if some members of '60s households realized they were watching or just dismissed it as a cute kid's show. Probably the latter.

As a cultural icon, you can't dismiss the influence this single special had on so much that followed it. Many of today's greatest names in animation have either cited it as a favorite (along with other Rankin/Bass films) or slipped its lore into their own work. Like The Wizard of Oz, elements of Romeo Muller's script have become part of our vernacular, from Charlie in the Box to Hermie the Dentist.

On Blu-ray, of course you can see the handmade quality of the animation in all its glory -- as well as details you may have missed, like Clarice's touch of blush or Fireball's freckles. AND, the long-omitted ""Peppermint mine"" scene has been included. If you've ever wondered if there was more to Yukon Cornelius' quest for riches, you'll see it just before Santa goes off to pick up the misfit toys.

For more about Rankin/Bass and Rudolph, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.

Frosty the Snowman came along in 1968, when the small New York-based Rankin/Bass production company was proving itself in a marketplace dominated by Hollywood animation giants with Saturday morning series (King Kong), feature films (The Daydreamer, Mad Monster Party) and other specials (Cricket on the Hearth). Like all of their weekly series, Frosty was done in what is now called 2-D or cel animation. Almost all of their animation was done in Japan, and this was one completed at Mushi Studios.

The animation isn't much more fluid than in their Animagic productions, but it works very well even by today's standards, in which flash is becoming so prevalent in TV cartoons. What makes it stand head and shoulders over most specials is its unerring simplicity, the voice cast (led by Jimmy Durante, Jackie Vernon and Billy DeWolfe) and the rich musical ""house style"" by Maury Laws. More than anything else, perhaps, the design by Paul Coker, Jr. comes across most dramatically in hand-drawn animation and makes Frosty look like a Christmas card come to life.

Watching the crisp, linear Coker images (which resemble his work for countless greeting cards and especially MAD magazine) in Blu-ray is a treat. This was either beautifully preserved or painstakingly restored or both. By daughter remarked that it ""looks like it was just made yesterday!""

The ""bonus"" on the disc is Frosty Returns, the 1992 special CBS commissioned years later (though the 1974 Rankin/Bass 'Twas the Night Before Christmas special usually held the ratings in the second half hour following Frosty), was directed by ""Peanuts"" legend Bill Melendez. CBS may have also requested that the special resemble a ""Peanuts"" special because Frosty Returns looks almost identical to a show with Charlie Brown and Snoopy.

Frosty Returns is notable for several reasons, including the voice of a very young Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olsen on MadMen) when she was a child actor, a witty script by Oliver Goldstick and Jim Lewis, and a nice supporting cast, especially if you're a SCTV and Saturday Night Live fan (the executive producer was SNL's Lorne Michaels, whose Broadway Video controlled the Rankin/Bass video library at the time).

My only quibble is that Frosty Returns either never got the loving care in the vault as it animated predecessor or there was a mastering problem, because there is a lot of ""line noise"" throughout, almost as if it were a VHS tape instead of a Blu-ray! I might guess that since this show is not the main attraction, it didn't matter as much, but you can't miss the flaws when you can see the images so clearly.

Other than that, Frosty the Snowman itself on Blu-ray does indeed look like it was made yesterday, rather than over 40 years ago.

Santa Claus is Comin' to Town came to ABC first in 1970, when Rankin/Bass was firing on all cylinders. The visual difference between this production and that of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is considerable, especially with regard to the immense, detailed sets and more intricate characters, designed by Paul Coker, Jr. Yes, there is the same animation ""on two's and three's"" as well as a few modest effects, but everything clicks within the brisk 51 minutes, none of which seem padded.

When I asked him to name a favorite special (in The Cartoon Music Book) Musical director/composer Maury Laws called this his favorite, because he thought every element was perfect, from the cast to the script to the overall feel. Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, ""Be Prepared to Pay"" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).

Santa Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.

In this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says ""It's not even safe here,"" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.

Okay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray.",1322352000,8,8112,4.9340175953079175

Disc 2 contains 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' (Told and sung by BURL IVES), 'Frosty the Snowman' (the RANKIN and BASS classic), 'Frosty Returns', and 'Cricket on the Hearth.'  I very much enjoyed these stories, and recognize them from when I grew up, as some of the quintissential classic Christmas stories, animated and puppet.

The sound and picture quality of the regular DVD sets are great: these classic films have clear sound and good picture, with very little which shows their great age and restoration/re-mastering.  You'll enjoy these classic stories and songs, as you decorate your Christmas tree, or relax in front of the fire with your family: I would highly recommend this great set of short, family-friendly Christmas classics, to enjoy and treasure year after year ~ would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1322092800,,1187,5.166666666666667

7201980,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"The Originals Christmas Classics is an elegantly packaged set of two DVDs which would make a great gift during the Holiday season to build up excitement, for little ones and for older loved ones as well (even yourself)!
These cartoons and specials featuring animated figures were originally created when TV was young, and when many of us were a LOT younger than we are now!
They have lost none of their charm in the translation. They have been lovingly digitally remastered, and offer some of the most famous and magical actors and voices of the times.
I particularly loved Burl Ives, as the snowman narrator of ""Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer"". He has such a great voice and the story is quite humorous and absorbing. Even the scary snow monster (not so scary after a twist in the tale) has a part in turning things around so that everything ends happily. I recommend that animated feature with great enjoyment!
There is music galore in all of these features, and some of the music is special to the core, such as that of ""The Little Drummer Boy"". Who doesn't find joy in that sweet tale? It teaches us, even when we are small, that we have much to offer. The main song is so memorable, it is a great addition to everyone's Christmas song list.
There is some occasional ""unhappiness"", such as in ""Frosty the Snowman"", and in ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" which of course is a fabulous rendition of the Scrooge story by Dickens, as played by the beloved Mr. Magoo, and even Fred Astaire narrates one of the animated features. I adore him and his divine voice!

I would have to say that the pace back in the old days is slower than it is today. I think it is fairly obvious when you realize that Halloween marks the start of the Christmas season. However, when a family, or a group of friends sit down and watch The Originals Christmas Classics, whether over a day or a month or on Christmas eve or morning, all of the memories of childhood well up and happiness dwells within.  Whether your little child is seeing these for the first time, or you are watching them for the hundredth time, there is a lovely understanding of what Christmas is about which we sometimes lose sight of, in the rush of today.

7201983,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"As there are number of collections called ""The Original Christmas Classics"", and another called ""The Original Television Christmas Classics"" there can be some confusion about that is included in each set.  Particularly as they are all collections of features by Rankin/Bass (except as noted) primarily from the 1960's, and traditionally shown during the holiday season.

""The Original Christmas Classics"" DVD set includes the seven features listed below, while the Bluray set with the same name, the subject of this review, only includes the first four titles.

1. Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (1964  47 minutes)
2. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town (1970  51 minutes)
3. Frosty The Snowman (1969  25 minutes)
4. Frosty Returns (1992  23 minutes
5. Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (1962  53 minutes)
6. Little Drummer Boy (1968  25 minutes)
7. Cricket On The Hearth (1967  49 Minutes)

The Bluray set has two video discs.  Disc One contains Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, while Disc Two features Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty The Snowman, and Frosty Returns.  Apparently all of the features have been remastered and restored to full length.  Presentation is full screen, with no subtitles.  Some Bluray sets apparently have an audio CD with songs taken from the specials, and some do not.

Santa Claus Is Coming to Town (1970): Rating 4.5 stars
While the legend of Santa Claus may be well-known, this delightful stop action feature delves into his early years, and also explains some of the common myths regarding Santa.  The story is told partially through narration by a letter carrier (voiced by Fred Astaire) who delivers mail to Santa at the North Pole.  An orphan baby boy is taken in and raised by the Kringle's, a family of toymaking elves.  He is named Kris, and when he grows up, the red-haired young man (voiced by Mickey Rooney) leaves home with a big bag of toys.  Through the gift of giving, Kris melts the ice cold heart of the Winter Warlock (voiced by Keenan Wynn), and makes a special friend in a schoolteacher named Jessica (voiced by Robie Lester).  Kris faces numerous obstacles, but overcomes them with the help of his friends and family.  He marries Jessica, and builds a home at the North Pole.  As Santa Claus, he distributes toys to the children of the world.

The improvements made in the stop action technique, make for a smoother looking and more lifelike presentation, and the feature looks terrific on Bluray.  With a creative uplifting story and some fun songs, this wonderful take on the origin of Santa Claus, is great family entertainment.

Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (1964): Rating 3.5 stars
A true holiday classic, Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer features Burl Ives, a warm, teddy bear of a man, lending his unforgettable voice to Sam the Snowman, the narrator of this tale.  Rudolph (voiced by Billie Richards) the son of Donner, runs away from home in shame, when his glowing red nose is discovered.  In the woods, he meets Hermey (voiced by Paul Soles), an elf who dreams of becoming a dentist.  The pair team up with prospector Yukon Cornelius (voiced by Larry D. Mann), and after escaping the clutches of the Abominable Snow Monster, they all make their way to the Island of Misfit Toys.

After growing into a young buck, Rudolph returns home, and tracks down his missing parents and friend Clarice, who are being held prisoner by the Snow Monster.  With the help of Yukon Cornelius and Hermy, the Snow Monster is defeated, and the prisoners are set free.  A raging storm threatens to ruin Christmas, but with Rudolph leading the sleigh team, Santa is able to deliver presents after all.

Memorable characters, an underlying message of acceptance, and quality songs, particularly those sung by Burl Ives, pretty much insures that this will continue to be a beloved holiday classic.  The Bluray image is reasonably sharp and blemish free.

Frosty The Snowman (1969): Rating 3 stars
This animated feature narrated by Jimmy Durante, tells the story of Frosty, who comes to life when the magical hat of Professor Hinkle (voiced by Billy De Wolf) lands on his head.  Together with his new friend Karen and Hinkle's rabbit Hocus Pocus, Frosty sneaks aboard a train headed north.  The trio ends up in the woods, with Hinkle trailing trying to retrieve his hat.  Fortunately Santa arrives to save the day, returning Karen home, and taking Frosty with him to the North Pole.  Based on the traditional song, Frosty The Snowman is a light and fun tale, probably best suited for young ones.  The Bluray looks fine, but probably won't blow you away.

Frosty Returns (1992): Rating 2.5 stars
This animated special was produced by CBS rather than Rankin/Bass, and features narration by Jonathan Winters.  Frosty arrives in the town of Beansboro, and becomes friends with children Holly and Charles.  A new invention called Summer Wheeze, a canned spray that instantly melts snow, threatens to ruin the town's traditional winter carnival.  John Goodman provides the voice of Frosty.  Image quality is just average.

The remastered stop action features look very good in high definition, however the animated ones seems just average.  Unless you are totally in love with Rudolph, and Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, one of the DVD collections might work out better.

If you do have a warm spot in your heart for holiday programming, you will want to at least take a look at all the options.  With so many similar products, some with the same name, it is easy to get confused, and Rankin/Bass probably needs to do a better job of making it clear to consumers just what they are buying.",1320105600,93,6728,5.434489402697495

7201986,3,B00XVJ3MW0,"This DVD features ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""The Lone Ranger and The Lost City of Gold"" - two colour feature length movies from 1956 and 1958 respectively after the famous TV series ended. Now that Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels have hit middle-age, you can see they're getting a little older for their roles here. But that doesn't take away from the enjoyment and excitement of watching the classic ""Lone Ranger"" in action and in colour. I found the first feature was the better of the two, having more action and stronger villains. It was also interesting to see them actually put a bit of money into the production of these films. Sometimes you could really see them cutting corners on the original TV series.

In terms of the DVD itself, there are no extras or special features such as subtitles unfortunately. Then again this is clearly designed to be a budget priced DVD. The prints are generally good, although the colours are a little dull or muted at times. ""The Lone Ranger"" is probably a B grade image. It's not razor sharp and there's some occasional speckling and the odd line through much of the early part of the film. The print does show its age and I was a little surprised by that. But it's still more than watchable and the damage is not really distracting. However, I was particularly disappointed to read afterwards that these were widescreen features so I'm assuming Classic Media has cropped these somehow. With ""The Lone Ranger"" there were a few brief vista scenes where the left and right sides of the screen seemed fuzzy like they've compressed the picture a bit.

I didn't notice as much print damage to ""The Lone Ranger and The Lost City of Gold."" It would probably rate a B+ but again it's not a restoration-type image. I'm assuming these are the best prints out there but the VCI releases that came out a few years ago might be comparable in image. They apparently have some special features like interviews with Clayton Moore's daughter.

All in all, I'd give this release a B. But it's hard not to be a little disappointed seeing all the time and effort that Classic Media put into their Lone Ranger 75th Anniversary Collector's Edition a couple of years back. That set was simply gorgeous! Hopefully Classic Media still has plans to release the remaining seasons of the classic ""Lone Ranger"" with that same degree of quality and care.",1304208000,35,2366,4.6826923076923075

7201992,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"When these TV Christmas specials came out, I was a little kid (I was born in '63).  RUDOLPH, FROSTY & SANTA were regular viewing at my house during those early years.  I have no idea what my parents thought of them, but I enjoyed them as a kid.

I had not watched these shows in many years, so it was fun to see them again.  It's tough to review these shows in the ""normal"" way, because it's tough to approach them with fresh eyes.  So I'll offer a few different approaches.

As nostalgia:  These shows are GREAT for nostalgia.  It's funny to see how many lines and scenes were still in my memory after all these years.  The stories and characterizations are quaint and old-fashioned (as is the animation), yet there is a charm and innocence there that newer Christmas stories can't achieve.  The stop motion animation of RUDOLPH and SANTA is particularly fun.  All those animals covered in craft felt...it made me think that with today's technology, someone could replicate and improve on the effects quite easily on a home computer.  But it would be tough for anyone today to make shows so innocent and so childlike without adding irony, or snarkiness or ""jokes for the adults.""  These are kids shows, made for kids.  So watching as an adult...I was taken back to my childhood.  I remembered our huge, clunky TV (heck, we even had Black & White a lot of the time).  I remembered flipping through the Sears Wishbook circling the toys I wanted while shows like FROSTY got me in the holiday spirit.  Also, watching them, I had to laugh some too at the simplistic messages and funny characters (the elf who secretly desires to be a dentist made me laugh out loud because of his ridiculous hair).  These shows are not quite at the level of camp, but they're close enough that I gleaned extra enjoyment from those qualities.

As works of art:  these shows have not stood the test of time all that well.  If these shows came out today as new works, they would be fairly universally panned.  Now I realize that this can be said of many classic old movies...they simply don't all wear as well as others, and it's not fair to apply today's standards.  But honestly, some things don't change.  There are minor plot holes throughout these pieces...and plot holes are never good.  Some of the songs are dreadful (others, of course, are classics)...and they likely always were dreadful.  And the pace drags.  Each of these works is about 48-52 minutes long, yet all could easily have been trimmed by 10 minutes.  I know they were stretched to fill an hour.  On the other hand, the voice work is generally quite good.  I had forgotten how perfect Burl Ives was as the snowman narrating RUDOLPH.  And Jimmy Durante and Fred Astaire are excellent.

For kids of today:  I'm not sure how a young child of today would take these pieces.  I think very young kids would still enjoy them, but older kids will be dreadfully bored.  If you're wanting to expose kids to ""old"" Christmas specials, test the water with THE GRINCH and CHARLIE BROWN.  If those go over well, then go ahead and break out FROSTY or RUDOLPH.  My 18 year old high school senior daughter did enjoy them though...I think she thought they were cute and funny.  Funny as in ""isn't it funny to see what attitudes people had back then.""

As a product:  the blu rays were of excellent quality.  There really isn't any bonus material to be had, and the aspect ratios of these shows don't even fill a wide screen TV.  So one might question the value of getting the blu rays.  But for a few bucks more, you get to see every bit of sparkle and color.  Particularly with the stop-motion stories, you can see every hair on the monster's chin, every bit of glitter in the snow, etc.  If you're interested in this product, I suggest spending the few bucks more and getting the absolute most you can from them.

Overall, this is fun to have, and no doubt as the years go by, I'll revisit some of these old friends.  While I doubt I would watch EVERY one of these in any given year...I can sure imagine them coming out once in awhile.  And when the time comes that I have grandkids in the house...you can bet these discs will be right out there for them to enjoy.

(Full disclosure:  I was lucky enough to receive a review copy of this product, but my review is an accurate reflection of my opinion. I received no additional incentive to provide a positive response.)",1290988800,3,4400,4.514575411913815
7201993,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"Don't get me wrong I love the new Christmas shows that are aired every year, usually featuring a popular character or just a Christmas-themed character in general.  I do though love the Original Christmas Classics that I watched when I was a kid:  Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Santa Claus is Comin' to Town!  I watched those three shows over and over that I drove my mom crazy she says!  I actually watched Frosty the Snowman so much the tape broke in our VCR!  I know the characters are not popular nor do my son's recognize them, but they were a big part of my Christmas season and I love that I can now share that with my boys.

Now I have seen parts of the the Original Christmas Classics movies on television, which they do air them occasionally now, but the quality was sub-standard compared to what technology now can do.  Well the Blu-ray version of The Original Christmas Classics is amazing!  With the shows now being digitally remastered and put onto Blu-ray discs, the quality really is amazing!  The sound is also better, which is great because I have been known to turn up the volume for Christmas songs!  I highly recommend this DVD to any parent who either remembers the Christmas Classics from back in the day or is just looking for some high quality Christmas programming for their kids!  I also want to add that even though this is a Christmas DVD set, I can guarantee we will be watching them throughout the year because we all like them so much!",1290470400,2,1493,4.5335820895522385
7201994,1,B00XVJ3MW0,"Up the River is soooo bad it may be John Ford's worst film ever. Apparently he intended to produce a drama, but when ""The Big House"" came out, starring Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, he changed his drama to a comedy, and did it at the last minute. Well, it shows. The film rambles with scenes that appear out of place and characters that are undeveloped. The sound track is particularly bad, even for 1930 films. And the ""comedy"" is clearly lacking. Hey, 1930 was not a bad year for films. As mentioned, ""The Big House"" came out that year and was a great prison film. In addition we have Lew Ayres' ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", Garbo in ""Anna Christie"", and Edward Robinson's ""Little Ceasar"". For comedy we have the Marx Brothers in ""Animal Crackers"" and Wallace Beery's ""Min and Bill"".

As far as John Ford, his silent films were never very good and it's only in the late 30s that he comes into his own and began producing memorable films. Indeed, Ford is clearly one of the lesser directors of the silent era and had he not continued to perfect his craft, his contributions from this era would be forgotten.

If you're a big fan of John Ford you may see some of his later and more successful techniques being tried out in this film, especially the ""business in the background"" which his later films are famous for, and the extensive use of musical numbers. Watch for Warren Hymer who plays the ""big lug"" and adopts many of the mannerisms Victor McLaglen would supply in a host of subsequent John Ford films, especially with John Wayne.

This is Spencer Tracy's first full length film and he is great. One senses the productive future he had in front of him. But sitting through ""Up the River"" to see an early Tracy seems to be a price too high to pay. Watch ""20,000 Years in Sing Sing"" from 1932 to see an early Tracy in a good film.

This is Bogart's second film, and the only time he appeared with Tracy, but even the most ardent Bogart fans will be disappointed with his performance. Indeed it was films like this which caused Bogart to leave Hollywood and return to the stage, and a few years later, when he came back, he had a different persona and was a far better actor.

Film history fans will enjoy this film, but for anyone else you'll find yourself up the river without a paddle.

The second feature is ""When Willie Comes Marching Home"", an undistinguished 1950 film from John Ford with Dan Dailey, William Demarest and Corine Calvert. The only notable feature about this film is that it marked the film debut of Vera Miles.

""Willie"" is clearly a better film than ""River"", in the same way that tuna fish makes a better meal than an anchovy, but what is really disappointing is that ""Willie"" comes in 1950 when Ford was at the peak of his directing skills, so this one note comedy doesn't have the same excuses that the early talkie did.

Which isn't to say that Dan Dailey doesn't do his usual good job, nor that there aren't a few snickers here and there. But from John Ford at the same time he was making ""The Quiet Man"" it's a real disappointment.

So if your purpose is to prove that John Ford couldn't make a funny film, this is a package for you. Don't get me wrong, Ford could weave comedy into his films with the skill of a master, but he was never able to make a good funny film, and even his best example, ""Mister Roberts"", which is a fine film, would hardly make anyone's list of the best 100 comedies of all time.",1290384000,,3444,4.40251572327044
7201995,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"Well you may not remember them if you or your children are under 20, but in the 80's and 90's we eagerly awaited the annual showing of each of these classics. The showing of ""Rudolph"" was the unofficial gateway to Christmas. Now let's fast-forward to today - my family has about 200 channels (many in high-definition), but i haven't seen many of these for YEARS! I am not sure why, but it seems like a few of these (with the exception of Rudolph) seems to have gotten lost in the shuffle. I am happy to see that these classics have been remastered

What I like about the series-

- You may have forgotten (I know I did) who actually narrated/told these stories -
  - ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" - narrated by Fred Astaire
  - ""Rudolph"" - told by Burt Ives
  - ""Frosty"" - Jimmy Durante
 Really, think about it. Where else can you buy a series that you child will watch that will introduce them to these legends?  Not only that, but these three are legends for a reason... all of these are really well done.

- Truly remastered- they have a great crisp look

- I know in my case I hadn't seen a couple of these in over 20 year (""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"") so for me, it did take me back to my childhood

Other things to consider-

- While these classics are very well-done - they are a bit dated for today's children. You know your kids better than I do... but if you have noticed they don't like some of the other older animated classics you may want to reconsider.

- Do you really need this on Blu-ray?  I think it is a option, since you get the upgrade to 1080P + the enhanced audio

- Remember these are made-for-tv specials, so they were not filmed for a 16:9 screen.

- All of us will have favorites within the series - but there may be one or two that weren't your favorites...

Final Verdict - It is hard to argue against purchasing it brings you classic specials with the legendary actors of the silver screen.

7201996,4,B00XVJ3MW0,"These are great days for fans of classic animation and members of a whole new generation of potential fans alike.  For the first time ever, Classic Media has assembled the beloved Rankin/ Bass Holiday classics into a single box-set in stunning high definition.

The cardboard outer slip box spans 3 Blu-rays (each within its own standard-sized plastic case): Santa Claus is Comin' to Town (48-minutes), Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer (47-minutes), and finally Frosty the Snowman (22-minutes).  The first two make use of Rankin Bass' famous stop-motion wooden puppeteering while the Frosty disc is traditional 2D animation.

The earliest of this collection is 1964's Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, which is a tale narrated by Sam the Snowman of a young red-nosed reindeer who, after being banned from playing all the reindeer games, forms an unlikely bond with Hermey (an elf who with dreams of becoming a dentist) and Yukon Cornelius, the prospector.

This ragtag group of outcasts encounters the Abominable Snowman and discovers a whole island of misfit toys. Knowing there is only one man who could help, Rudoph heads back to the North Pole on one foggy Christmas Eve. But just like modern airports, Santa's sleigh is grounded due to the low visibility.  All that stands in their way is a lack of a bright red beacon to guide said sleigh back to the island.

Next up is 1969's 2D Frosty the Snowman, where a discarded silk top hat finds itself the cause of a struggle between a washed-up magician and a group of schoolchildren who realize it has the ability to bring a run-of-the-mill snowman to boisterous life (complete with the opening line ""Happy Birthday"").

Faced with the reality that their snow-made friend would melt along with the winter snow, Frosty and one of the young girls in the group trying to protect the magic hat stowaway on a freight train headed for the North Pole.  Like any true hack, the magician doesn't know when to exit gracefully and pursues the duo northward.  Matters escalate until Santa Claus himself has to get involved.

Finally the most recent piece in this collection is 1970's Santa Claus is Comin' to Town! In it the Mailman decides to answer some of the most common questions about Santa Claus then proceeds to tell the viewer about a small baby named Kris who was left on the doorstep of the local toy makers, the Kringle family.

When Kris is old enough, he volunteers to deliver the toys to Sombertown. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Kris, the Burgermeister has outlawed all toys in his jurisdiction, having tripped on and been injured by a toy duck while walking out of City Hall's steps.

Kris, however, decides to do ignore the ban and begins handing out toys to the tikes.  Once Burgermeister orders that all of the residents of Sombertown to lock their windows and doors to keep the lawbreaking Kris out, he simply uses the chimney.

Relocation to the frigid North Pole and a new identity are in order for the jolly do-gooder when Burgermeister's laws prove inflexible and the legend of Santa Claus spreads to the lands well beyond Sombertown.

Interestingly enough, the box set includes the 1992 2D animated sequel to Frosty the Snowman (Frosty Returns) as well.  The 22-minute cartoon (unfortunately not done by Rankin Bass and hence not a direct sequel to the original) tells of Beansboro Elementary School being canceled for the day due to a seven-inch snowfall and Frosty's visit to the town.

An evil inventor named Mr. Twitchell has, meanwhile, creates ""Summer Wheeze"", an aerosol spray that makes snow instantly disappear much to the dismay of the kids (and Frosty) but delight to the adults.

In all the runtime of these digitally remastered gems comes in at just over 150-minutes and the material is timeless enough to appeal to the youngsters while managing to raise a smile out of the adults.  Truly these animated films have never looked better than on Blu-ray and the sound mix has certainly benefited over the mono track with which the original specials aired.

Kudos to Classic Media/ Vivendi for not only rounding up all of these traditional tales but for giving them the star-treatment on the Blu-ray medium and boxing them up as a single collection that looks great on the entertainment center shelf.",1290211200,2,4265,4.887656033287101
7201997,5,B00XVJ3MW0,"When you think of classic television Christmas specials, the top two that are likely to come to mind are Charlie Brown and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. This is practically a fact by now. Why? They're light-hearted, well-crafted, enduring, and simply delightful to watch at any age. They capture the real magic of Christmas, and in the case of the Rankin/Bass classics, always headed up by Rudolph, they embody the excitement of a child's Christmas! If you grew up with the Rankin/Bass holiday classics, you know you can enjoy them just as much today, and you probably want your kids too as well. Frankly, I don't have kids myself, and I still have these specials on standard def and am now thrilled to have them on Blu-Ray. They're wonderful annual revisits, and it wouldn't be Christmas without them!

This new Blu-Ray release from Classic Media brings back Rankin/Bass's big Christmas trio, their original Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, their original Frosty the Snowman, and their how Santa became Santa classic, Santa Claus is Coming to Town. As a bonus, we also get the contemporary special, Frosty Returns. It's not the true sequel to the original Frosty, but it's an extra program to watch at any rate.

Based on the beloved song, ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" is the stop-motion ""animagic"" classic from 1964 about a little reindeer born with a nose that glows red! Teased about his nose as a child, Rudolph runs away from Santa's village and makes new friends along the way, but he also encounters the Bumble snow-beast! Then, when a fog comes up to threaten Santa's Christmas Eve flight, it's only Rudolph's nose that can save the day! Featuring unforgettable songs from Burl Ives (who plays Sam the Snowman) and others, ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" has become a holiday tradition loved by millions!

""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" is, in my opinion, the definitive version of how Santa became Santa. This 1970 animagic film, hosted by a stop-motion Fred Astaire, gives us the story of Santa being left on the doorstep of a toy making elf family when he is a baby, being raised by them and amongst the forest animals, going on missions to deliver toys to the children of Sombertown, meeting Winter the Warlock and Jessica, the future Mrs. Claus, and going up against the awful Burgermeister Meisterburger. This charming take on Santa's origins includes the voices of Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as Winter, and the great Paul Frees in several roles. Like most Rankin/Bass holiday classics, this is based on a classic song.

""Frosty the Snowman"", from 1969, is probably Rankin/Bass's best traditionally animated work. The charming character designs, voices, music, and simple story are absolutely wonderful. Based on another classic song, this is the story of a snowman that comes to life when the children who built him add a discarded magic hat. Unfortunately, snowmen can't last forever unless they are in a place that is always snowy, and the nasty Professor Hinkle, the frustrated magician who threw out his hat, wants the hat back now that he knows it holds real magical power! Hosted by an animated Jimmy Durante, ""Frosty the Snowman"" is such a treat that it even inspired 3 traditionally animated sequels so far, though only ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"", from the same creators and with Jackie Vernon back as Frosty's voice, is really good.

And speaking of the Frosty sequels, particularly the not so good ones, the Frosty disc in this 3 disc set also holds a bonus special, ""Frosty Returns"". Truthfully, I don't think this can be called an official sequel. This 1992 effort is not the work of Rankin/Bass. Surprisingly, this one is from the creators of the wonderful Peanuts specials, sans Charles Shulz, but it has none of their magic. ""Frosty Returns"", which depicts a Frosty voiced by John Goodman and with nothing in common with the original aside from being made of snow, is hosted by an animated (and for some reason miniature) Jonathan Winters in an attempt to mimic the host-character style of the Rankin/Bass faves. He presents the story of a town that is becoming snow-free thanks to a businessman's spray can invention, ""Summer Wheeze"". Frosty and his friends go on a mission to prove to the townsfolk that snow can actually be a good thing, but all in all it's a story that is pretty uninvolving and forgettable.

Lastly, this Blu-Ray 3-pack comes with a bonus CD of Christmas music that includes Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer sung by Burl Ives, Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree sung by Brenda Lee, Santa Claus is Coming to Town sung by the Jackson 5, Jingle Bells sung by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Frosty the Snowman sung by Jimmy Durante, A Holly Jolly Christmas sung by Burl Ives, and Jingle Bell Rock sung by Bobby Helms. This CD is actually a really nice collection of songs. If memory serves, it's more pleasing than the one which came with the standard def set I own from a few years back. And it's worth mentioning that I had never heard this version of Durante's Frosty the Snowman before. Very cute!

So, how does this new Blu-Ray release stack up? Well, if one compares it to the DVD collection of these films that came before and ignores the issue of HD quality, then the old set wins with its higher quality packaging and inclusion of far more programming and bonuses. But, if you're looking to buy Blu-Ray, it is probably the higher picture and sound quality you are after. If that's the case, then yes, you want this. It's definitely the best these specials have looked to date, and these specials belong in the collection of anyone who truly loves Christmas! Overall, it's a fine package to own and makes a great gift, but I'm glad I have the standard def set as well. Being a fan of Christmas specials and Blu-Ray, for me they are both essential. If you are just after the big three specials, for now at least, and assuming you own a Blu-Ray player or PS3, this set is the way to go.",1289347200,,5963,4.789115646258503
