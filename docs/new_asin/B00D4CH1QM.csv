5774459,4,B00D4CH1QM,"After seeing someone else's ""Like"" of this film go by in my social media news feed, I was intrigued enough to investigate just what this crowd sourced project was all about.

As a fan of history this film seemed a natural for me to gravitate to and as I read more about it, I became more and more determined to help this film be successful.  Months later, after the filmmaker was able to raise nearly double his original goal, and expand the official release of this film into more cities, I finally received the reward that was promised to me for my donation: a copy of the film on Blu-ray disc.

I put the disc into my Blu-ray player just to check it out and see what I thought of the film thinking that I'd wind up watching the film later, but once I put in the disc, wife 2.0 and I both found ourselves drawn into the film wanting to see it through to the conclusion.

I've followed the filmmaker on Facebook since first finding out about the film and through that connection I had seen the filmmakers reaction to one relatively negative review that he had received.  (Actually, I'd say it as a pretty harsh review of the film.)  It seemed, from my own reading of the review, that the reviewer had pretty much missed the point of the film instead finding himself too concerned about the filmmaker's technique and artistic styling that went into this film.

Readers should notice that I didn't give this film all 5 of the stars that I could have in the rating, rather stopping at 4.  I (and my wife) enjoyed the film and liked the way that it was put together, but I can't say the filmmaker achieved perfection in his intended goal.  I think he did a good job, and I admire the technique he used (using historical photos to create backgrounds that would be used with green screen techniques) but I must admit that there were more than a couple of places where the technique didn't work as well for me and made the film seem, well, a bit cheaply made when I suspect it was anything but.

[ actually I could side detour here a bit and rant on a bit about a filmmaker that I'm also a fan of, Roger Corman, see for example:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Corman-s-World/dp/B007P0ZVPM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Corman's World</a>, as he was definitely the king of budget filmmaking, but that is a completely different topic really ]

The story that makes up this film is a good and interesting one and left me (and I think my wife) feeling like we had learned more about Abraham Lincoln's time in the office of the Presidency, along with more about his friend and protector, Ward Hill Lamon.  While we all know how Lincoln's life ended, not many know that much about Lamon and the work he had done.

Wife 2.0 felt that the star who portrayed Abraham Lincoln didn't seem to quite fit the role.  He came through nicely, sounded like most people might have expected Lincoln to sound, but didn't quite fit the physical frame that most people would expect of Abraham Lincoln.  Where there's an expectation that Abraham Lincoln was tall and towered over most others around him, the scenes in this film that show him with others would likely leave viewers feeling that Lincoln was of somewhat average height.  I know thats a small nit to pick, and that in the end this was likely a strategic decision to have a better quality actor in the role compared to someone that just happened to be the right size, but it was at least a little distracting while watching the film.

In the end, again, I'm proud to have been a backer (even if only in a small way) of this film, am glad that it was released and is making it out on Blu-ray and DVD and highly encourage others to watch it.  It would be an excellent film to show in schools and would hopefully hold the interest of young viewers.",1370390400,13,3818,4.548905109489051
5774460,4,B00D4CH1QM,"Absolutely brilliant at times. The techniques used in filming were quite refreshing. Almost stage like, which I enjoy. The Gettisburg Address was moving and captivating. Fine job. One I will watch again.",1504051200,2,203,5.375
5774461,5,B00D4CH1QM,"Almost a light hearted view of a serious story of the person who was commander in chief leading the union army in the civil war, told in the flavor of a stage play, with a script that is explicitly enunciated so we the audience don't miss innuendoes that could have been missed with so much dialogue. In times like these, with another republican president similarly misaligned by the press, it is a heartfelt story to see this man grow to realize his place and mission in God's world.",1503792000,4,484,4.511363636363637
5774462,5,B00D4CH1QM,I thought the movie was very well done and entertaining. It seems to be historically accurate and I was surprised to learn a few new things along the way.,1503100800,2,154,4.344827586206897
5774463,3,B00D4CH1QM,The videography was awful. It was like watching a filmed stage play.,1502668800,,68,4.75
5774464,5,B00D4CH1QM,"This is not a Hollywood blockbuster-budget film; it was funded by Kickstarter, and for a film of such humble origins, I believe they did a fine job.  The cinematography is clever, with action superimposed against a background of actual history photos, a feature over which some reviewers who are expecting Cecil B DeMille have griped. Although they claim to have made great efforts to preserve historical accuracy, there are some points where great liberties were taken (Lamond's views toward slavery, for example).  Where the film excels, however, is in its depiction of Abraham Lincoln.  There is a tendency to portray Lincoln as a stoic, grim-faced and unflappable man; contemporary accounts, however, reveal him to have had a keen sense of humor and at times to have acted almost clownish.  Tom Amandes, as Lincoln, gives a superb performance that does a lot to humanize our most revered president. It was suitably delightful for me to see Mr. Lincoln brought to life so skilfully that I was willing to accept some artistic license taken for the benefit of the narrative.

If you are looking for HD special effects, don't watch it.  If you are looking for a perfectly accurate historical documentary, don't watch it.  If you are looking to step back in time and meet Abraham Lincoln as he was, then you should definitely watch it.",1501545600,5,1334,4.928571428571429

5774467,4,B00D4CH1QM,"Rotten Tomatoes gave this creative film a surprising low score & I generally trust that, however, perhaps since I am such a Lincoln fan I beg to differ!
Historically accurate facts peppered through out gives a more favorable view of Mary Todd and portrays the anguish felt by Abraham Lincoln at the loses not only of his own children but for the deaths of over 300,000 young men in the unfortunate and inevitable Civil War. One could actually become a believer in ""devine providence"" by some of the scenes brilliantly acted by relative ""unknowns"".
Give it a try, regard the unusually use of set design as ""art"" and it willl have far greater impact.
The actors completely recreate this difficult and important time all Americans should have an understanding of.",1500163200,3,760,4.8538461538461535
5774468,5,B00D4CH1QM,The story and use of old photographs offer a perspective on Lincoln and the War between the States I had not previously considered. This is an excellent production that I would recommend to any serious student of this period of history.,1499817600,3,236,4.780487804878049

5774471,5,B00D4CH1QM,"Can we have more movies like this? Having historical photos gave this movie true authenticity. Much like the movie Tron. Some of the dialog seemed stilted today, but that's just the more formal way people talked back then. More than anything, I appreciate how the movie didn't water down for modern audiences genuine dialogues about faith the real characters had. This one aspect gave the movie a power beyond just re-enactments of events. Because of that, I came away from the film satisfied that I connected with the subject of the film.",1499126400,2,539,4.869565217391305
5774472,2,B00D4CH1QM,"Interesting technique of using actual photographs of the time, but would have been more effective had they been colorized. Poor acting by actor who plays Lincoln-- which is surprising since they have some good actors otherwise.  Worth watching but don't expect too much.",1498780800,,270,5.27906976744186
5774473,4,B00D4CH1QM,"The Lincoln Presidency from the perspective of Lincoln's friend and bodyguard.  The acting is excellent with Tom Amandes as Lincoln and Lea Coco as his friend and bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon.  The film begins with Lamon under threat of violence to explain his failure to protect Lincoln from assassination.  Lamon tells the story--of how he came to be Lincoln's protector and of the trials, tragedies and final success of the Lincoln Presidency.  Amandes' Gettysburg Address is stirring and deep, without melodrama.  The Address alone is enough to make the film worthwhile.  The use of historical photographs as background to actors and scenes is interesting, though at times it lends an odd, cartoon-like quality to some scenes.",1498780800,6,727,5.224137931034483
5774474,5,B00D4CH1QM,"I loved the story, the historic photographs, the music, the acting and the heart of who Lincoln was. This film brought to life all the people we know only as perhaps old photos of historical figures from eras gone by. This was very enjoyable and enlightening, as well as applicable to today's events.",1498521600,3,300,4.679245283018868
5774475,5,B00D4CH1QM,"I'm sure many liberties were taken in the portrayal of the relationship between Marshall Hill Damon and President Abraham Lincoln. Nonetheless, I found this film to be what it should be--entertaining, while informative.  As an historical drama I found the integration of computer graphics with the performances to be quite unique, the stereographs moving as they were intended to be, to remind the viewer of the real cruelty of the war being fought which can't be conveyed in simple numbers.  Several well-known scenes are re-enacted, such as the speech at Gettysburg, and Lincoln's pronouncement about U.S. Grant, ""he fights""--also an intentional slight of General MacClellan.  As a result of this conflict, nearly every city I have been through in the old North has a Grant and a MacClellan St., while nearly every bourough, parish, town or city in the old South has a Robert E. Lee St. and a Martin Luther King Blvd.  Although it is portrayed, I don't think many current hyphenated-Americans are aware the extent to which Lincoln truly wanted to ""bind the nations wounds"" with ""malice toward none, and charity for all"" particularly the widows and orphans of a domestic conflict that led to the death or 2% of the population.  The men who died in that war would have fathered leaders we would have known long into the 20th century, women who would have taken up the cause of suffrage successfully much earlier, and our nation would look much different were in not for his assassination.  The visuals are mostly correct (e.g. costuming), except for the odd appearance of a plastic headed cheap 20th century banjo that the Marshall seemed to carry everywhere and play often for Lincoln's amusement.  I haven't read his two books, but I suspect this is mentioned somewhere.  It would have been easy to call the Nashville Musician's Union and find a consultant who could have directed the producers to a correct period instrument or replica.  Most viewers probably don't notice details that small--but set dressers probably have a field day with the improper set dressing for the 1830-1865 period as well.

Nonetheless, the movies is worth the time, and tells a much less well-travelled path (i.e., the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln).  It causes me to wonder why we haven't such a similar film about Kennedy (1945-1963) which is sorely lacking.....However self-serving the Marshall's accounts of a rather full-time job as presidential bodyguard are integrated into this film, they don't take away from its poignancy in portraying Lincoln's character alternating between true grief, and heartfelt laughter to which he was also disposed.",1498521600,5,2637,5.109302325581395

I was disappointed with almost everything about this movie.  The story dragged. It's hard to say much about the acting because the script was so bad that I don't think any actors could have done much with it.

5774483,5,B00D4CH1QM,Very good and informative movie about a little known friend and bodyguard of President Lincoln. The low cost film uses many old photos as a back drop for the actors and I enjoyed seeing them.

5774493,1,B00D4CH1QM,"I have been a Civil War amateur historian for 50 years and teach a class on Lincoln. I have a large library of Lincoln books and movies. This one was very disappointing. Someone said it looked like a high school production. I don't even think it had those values. The backgrounds (green screen) were very noticeable and disconcerting. The acting was very amateurish. The script had even Lincoln's closest friends against him (sure they disagreed a lot, but nobody was out and out hostile once Simon Cameron left). And at times I wondered if it was supposed to be a musical (I fast forwarded through those parts). I will put it in my collection, but only because I would feel bad trying to unload this stinker on someone on ebay.

I really tried to like it but as with the other bad reviews, the acting was wooden, it was such a self glorifying movie about Hill, you'd think it was about him, not Lincoln. And the dreadful and comically embarrassing many times Hill broke out singing and playing the banjo made me cringe. As another reviewer said, it appeared to by no better than a group of high school kids deciding to have a play aka Mickey Rooney. Please, save your money. I can count on one hand the movies I have either wal;ked out on or pulled from the DVD player before it even made it halfway thru and this was one of them. Sorry but the gimmick just made the movie cheesier. Too bad I can't give it No stars or even a half star. Dreadful, just dreadful. Worse than Plan 9 from Outer Space.

The acting was first and foremost horrible. The reading of the Gettysburg Address was akin to Rosanne Barr performing the National Anthem. The dialogue was unrealistic, at times modern, and mostly fictional. The theological discussion Lincoln has with a former slave had me scratch my head. His kneeling afterwards and belief that he had a divine purpose was Lamon's answer to Herdon's biography which claimed Lincoln was an atheist. I wouldn't put either view into a film.

The background was taken from 3D viewmaster pictures and even crowds were still photos with ""actors"" in front of them. It gave the film a cheap surreal look. Historically I was scratching my head too. Upon their meeting they wanted Hill to perform a song from West Virginia which wasn't a state at that time. The famous picture of Washington which we all looked at in school with its bottom partially burned off from the War of 1812 was fully intact in this film. Edward D. Baker died in Oct. of 1861 but is presented at a time of the announcements of battles well into 1862.

There is a constant self glorification of Ward Hill Lamon whose speech was grandiose and yes he was also an Amazing Kreskin at predicting the death of the President. Not an impressive film.",1415664000,,1474,4.75

I loved this movie for many reasons. For one reason, I'll be able to show this to my junior high students in class. I appreciate that the ""fluff"" added to the basic story line was appropriate and credible. Another reason I loved it was based on the usage of old photos within the movie. Example: Lincoln and McClellan after Antietam. And lastly, the ending of this movie was the greatest tribute to Lincoln! I loved the last seconds of this movie! Thanks Sal! :-)",1400889600,2,635,4.482758620689655
5774518,4,B00D4CH1QM,"Just finished watching the film Saving Lincoln and some of it's special features. As one who is not a big fan of our country's 16th President, I have to say that this film humanizes him more than any other portrayal that I've ever seen, and makes it easier for me to view him simply as a man, rather than just as a tyrant. Though it likely won't change my opinion of ""Honest Abe"" entirely, it might make me reflect more kindly upon him after I've had further time to reflect on the viewpoint of history that this film presents.

The reason that it so marvelously portrays Lincoln as an actual flesh & blood man, rather than a god-like hero or a demon of Biblical proportions, is because it tells the Abe Lincoln story from the perspective of Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln's self-appointed bodyguard & close personal friend. The film portrays the friendship between Lincoln & Lamon almost like the friendship shared by David & Jonathan that can be found in the pages of Scripture.

Another aspect of this film that makes it so very good is the way that it was filmed. As the movie's Wikipedia entry tells, ""[it] was shot on a green screen stage, with a technique known as ""CineCollage"" used to create interior and exterior locations. Actors, extras, furniture, and props were filmed and combined with period photographs via the CineCollage process, which relied on off-the-shelf visual effects tools."" By using this technique, you get to see the actors working in front of the digitally manipulated imagery from the 1860s, thus giving as near a real look at what it might have been like as may ever be possible.

My only critique of the film would be that, in my opinion, all aspects of the film should have been shot in black & white. Only then do I think the film could have seemed more authentic.

We've seen Lincoln the clever lawyer, the shrewd politician, the great statesman, the tragic sacrifice before.  How about Lincoln as seen by a close friend: enjoying an evening in a tavern, test firing a rifle, arguing about how much protection he needs or sitting at a seance?  All factual.  Those are here and a lot more.  I found the story engrossing and the acting superb - particularly Tom Amandes in the lead role.  None of us can ever know with certainty how Lincoln actually came across in real life, but Amandes seems right to me  - easygoing on the surface, with profound seriousness and anguish underneath, and never forgetting his roots.  The technique of digitally placing the actors within period photographs added to the achievement.  I watched it on two successive days and enjoyed it as much or more the second time.  The film had a greater impact on me than the Day-Lewis blockbuster.

5774547,5,B00D4CH1QM,"Out of all the Lincoln movies I've seen (and I'm kind of an addict) ""Saving Lincoln"" has more scenes that have you saying ""C'mon, that never happened"" only to learn that the historians say, ""Yes, it did -- and pretty much as depicted here."" This is a story I've never seen filmed before and one that gives you more insight into him as a man, namely the story of Lincoln and his best friend. Lincoln wasn't a marble statue unerringly saving the union; he was like this. He liked banjo music, he enjoyed jokes, his greatest speech didn't go over well, and sometimes he really did seem to have a death wish -- just as this film shows, and most others don't.

Plus the innovative production techniques used to make ""Saving Lincoln"" are fascinating. They put you right there because, thru a process I don't completely understand despite the ""Making Of..."" features, the sets are actual period photos. But they've been cleaned up and animated so that they look fresh and real. It's really amazing.

I also have to mention the acting. Tom Amandes has taken a different tack from Daniel Day-Lewis, not trying to duplicate Lincoln's face with makeup and imitate his voice. Instead Amandes seems to get inside his soul and gives a deep, subtle performance of what the man must have gone thru emotionally. Lea Coco does the same thing with his much more blustery, dynamic, but deeply tragic character of Ward Hill Lamon, who despite all his efforts couldn't save his best friend in the crucial hour. Can you imagine having to carry that with you for the rest of your life? Having to explain it to people? And Penelope Ann Miller is just a fantastic Mary Lincoln! She just is, that's all I can say.

It is a factually accurate film covering Lincoln's life from the perspective of his friend and bodyguard Ward Hill Lamon.  The performances are excellent, but the film's greatest asset is its superb visuals.
Using 19th century photographs as backgrounds, the film is always visually dynamic.  One particular favorite moment is when Lincoln and Lamon walk into a photograph of the East Room of the White House. Like Steven Spielberg with LINCOLN, director Salvador Litvak is most interested in giving us a Lincoln who is ambitious, actively involved in all facets of the Civil War, and, just as important, a loving husband and father.  SAVING LINCOLN also shows us a side of Lincoln we never have really seen. Lincoln loved funny songs and jokes and loved to laugh.  The film is filled with beautiful photography, and the most beautiful shot of all is the last one: Lincoln sitting in Ford's Theater watching a performance of MY AMERICAN COUSIN and during the funniest moment in the play, smiling and enjoying a most hearty laugh.

5774556,5,B00D4CH1QM,"While the 2012 film Lincoln was very good, and it was a pleasure sitting in a theater and hearing people laugh at Lincoln's jokes, even if they were one hundred and fifty years old, this film seems to capture something more like the connection Lincoln had to his adopted home in Illinois. I had read Lamon's book Remembrances of Abraham Lincoln, through the Illinois Digital Archive, and it was a fascinating account.  As does the film, it begins in the 8th judicial circuit in the 1840s, and follows Lincoln through his career in Congress, the two races for the US Senate in 1856 and 1858, the Presidency and right up to that last encounter. The plaintive statement ""and that was the last time I saw my friend"", is as heartrending in the film as it was in print.

For me, historical figures are more interesting for their humanity, than the monumental achievements of their careers. Ever since I was a child, I felt more of a connection to Lincoln from a line like ""I cannot spare this man, he fights!""  than from ""four score and seven years ago"". This film, like Lamon's book, sees the Lincolns as a family, faced with a terrible tragedy, reflecting the tragedy that befell all families in the years from 1861-1865. They face the end of the nation, with the collapse of the Union, but with the help of Hill's ""West Virginia Claw Hammer"" they enjoy a spirited rendition of the trials of ""old Dan Tucker"". In the verse that Mary sings alone, she seems almost a young girl in love again. That's a rare view of the First Lady, that so many film makers have preferred to see as either a spendthrift or a madwoman. I've always thought it was unfair to view her so harshly, since by the time Robert had her committed to the sanitarium in my home town, Batavia, the lady had buried all but one of her children, her parents and her husband.

Lincoln has been treated more as a human than Mary, by historians, the commutation of death sentences, that beautiful letter to Mrs. Bixby, the mother who ""laid such a costly sacrifice upon the altar of freedom"", and the admonition to the former slave who knelt at his feet when he and Tad visited Richmond. That human touch rings true here, throughout the film. Lincoln isn't always the humorist, laughing to keep from weeping, but he also shows his temper to General McClellan. Its an altogether human picture of our 16th President and his family.

All in all, I can highly recommend this presentation of Lincoln, as a needed addition to a view of our 16th President. He wasn't made of marble after all.",1370822400,37,2540,4.56140350877193

His values, his passion, his hopefulness when things are most difficult have been markers to recall and follow when possible. I have seen so many Lincolns, read so many Lincoln books that I almost don't know who he was. The distinct portrayal of him in relationship to his dearest friend and protector, Ward Hill Lamon, added a unique and special essence to him as a man. Saving Lincoln, by putting the two men in their literal historic place was so powerful. The art of the video collage meant that what is referred to is in its actual place.

I suspect the truth lies somewhere in between the rumors and what you see here.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone interested in Lincoln.,1510876800,,246,4.833333333333333
8589534,5,B00D4CH1QM,"Excellent interpretation and interesting cinematic techniques.  This is a bit different than most might expect, possibly leading to some reviewers disappointment.  This is original and, in its own way refreshing.  Give it a try.",1508371200,,228,5.647058823529412
8589535,5,B00D4CH1QM,"I am somewhat mystified re the reviews that were anything but 5 stars.  This movie was well worth seeing.  Lincoln was given a human touch beyond the normal hero without faults that mark almost all other films about him.  I found this movie a wonderful piece of film making.  The historic photos used as backdrops was very creative, effective and completely different from other film sets.  I found the acting superb, because it portrayed the characters as humans and not slick actors delivering their lines.  So happy to have seen a meaningful story which seems to be rare in the super gloss action tripe that is the current norm..",1506729600,2,632,4.752293577981652

8589537,5,B00D4CH1QM,"At first this seems unusual and fake looking, but it was shot to look theatrical. The actors were likeable, and believable after awhile.  I realized it was all meant to be a theatrical thread throughout the movie.  I enjoyed it and learned a lot.  I would recommend this film for sure.  It was a bold decision to shoot it like this, but I appreciate the art of it.",1504224000,,364,4.3088235294117645
8589538,5,B00D4CH1QM,"While I am unsure about the extent of historical accuracy, but assuming truth, this movie does much to repair the reputation of President Lincoln's long time friend and chosen bodyguard. Vilified mightily at the time for abandoning his post on that fateful night, Ward Lamon, was painted as slovenly, a drunkard and amazingly ill fitted for his post as protector of the POTUS.
  Many things would change a resulting from the assassination of the President, chief among them the formation of the Secret Service. This alone acknowledged, by the country for the need of a well staffed, well armed and supremely trained ""force"" to protect the ""Office of the President and the man who filled that position.""

The cinematic technique worked well with blending of the historic photos into the scene. That the actors and set remained ""in color"" helped to bring you the moment. This as opposed to fill black and white that, for me at least, feels more like a glimpse of the record.

Enjoyable, I recommend it. O",1504137600,3,1002,4.842105263157895
