The Omaha Worlds Fair gives the gang an electrifying education in computer mad science inside the High-Tech House of the Future. Daphne cant wait to see her favourite band, The Hex Girls, shoot their latest video in Transylvania. But just when the group strikes their first chord, The Vampire Strikes Back. In Homeward Hound, a fiercely fanged cat creature petrifies the competing pooches at a dog show, including the vising dog Scoob-Doo. Then its off to the City by the Bay for the Grind Games in San Franpshycho, where a seaweed-sprouting ghoul from Alcatraz prison scares competing skateboarders to the core. When the band Simple Plan meets an invisible hijacker en route to the Montreal Rock Festival, only Scooby and the gang can see the light in Simple Plan and the Invisible Madman.  it's a region 1.
After the gang votes on their destination they end up at the annual dog show courtesy of Scooby. There Shaggy runs into an old acquaintance Meadow and her dog, M'Lady Moonbeam. However, the gang then has an unpleasant run-in with a cat creature who seems bent on ruining the dog-show and stealing the puppies of former winner dog, Crissie.
