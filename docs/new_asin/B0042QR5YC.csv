4251928,5,B0042QR5YC,"John Huston's directorial versatility is carved in relief once more with this memorable masterpiece.

Huston focuses his attention around the years 1890-1895 of Freud when he was began his investigation around the early sexuality.

Susannah York is amazing too as the injured victim. An agile and well rounded script make the rest.

Don't think it twice and go for this one.",1408752000,,374,5.098360655737705

4251930,4,B0042QR5YC,"The Korean region-free edition offers a clear image and removable subtitles, but the picture is letter-boxed and has not been transferred to CD anamorphically. Hence it is a great disappointment to view it on a modern HD TV where it floats in the center of your large screen like a little rectangle. The film, a miserably neglected masterpiece by John Huston and containing excellent performances by a fine cast, is useful in understanding the methods of Sigmund Freud. College students who see it always compare it to the B&W episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" -- and indeed, the film has something of a Rod Serling look and dreamlike quality. The movie desperately need Criterion to buy it and release it, but I have waited for this to happen for decades and it hasn't.",1386979200,4,768,4.7819548872180455

4251932,4,B0042QR5YC,"A very imaginative and artful biopic about a man looked upon by many as the father of modern psychiatry, when, in fact, Sigmund Freud was first and foremost a neurologist by training, before engrossing himself for the remainder of his life in psychoanalytic theory. As a practicing neurologist myself, I found this story most interesting and emotionally involving, even if John Huston took a lot of historical liberties. The direction, acting, and cinematography were all excellent. I understand that Montgomery Clift was at his own emotional loose ends while making this picture, taxing Huston to his own limits, but I think his neurotic energy served him well in his portrayal of Freud. The DVD seems to be a good transfer. The only technical annoyance is that I haven't found a way to turn off the subtitles.",1372204800,6,811,4.970588235294118
4251933,5,B0042QR5YC,"All talents are in top form, especially Huston and Clift.  Why this film is virtually unrecognized in America is beyond me.  Unfortunately this dvd is a cut version, and the cuts include key scenes.

4251934,5,B0042QR5YC,"Unlike his fellow colleagues, the young doctor Sigmund Freud (Montgomery Clift) doesn't see hysteria in patients as a ploy to get attention but rather a symptom of a deeper, underlying neuroses. With this in mind, he concentrates on exploring the subconscious, often using hypnosis, in an attempt unlock their repressed memories and bring about a cure. Directed by John Huston, it's impossible to portray a lifetime of work in a two hours, fifteen minute running time so Huston cheats by cramming many case histories in several patients. Much of it can justifiably be called simplistic (as many of Freud's detractors would say of many of his theories) but what Huston has done, and what makes the film work, is turn Freud's research into a psychological thriller and exploration of the subconscious mind that is as riveting as any Agatha Christie mystery. Clift as Freud seems a trifle more reactive than necessary. In a way, this seems like an extension of his doctor in SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER. The real scene stealer here is the young Susannah York as his neurotic patient who is a cornucopia of symptoms (my favorite moment is when York says, ""I was raised Prostitute ..... I mean Protestant!""). Curiously, Huston himself narrates Freud's inner thoughts rather than Clift. There's a superb atonal Oscar nominated score by Jerry Goldsmith. With Larry Parks, Susan Kohner, Eileen Herlie, Eric Portman, David McCallum and Rosalie Crutchley.

The Spanish DVD is a sharp wide screen (1.78) transfer but non anamorphic with both English and Spanish tracks and removable subtitles.",1297555200,9,1575,5.128404669260701
4251935,4,B0042QR5YC,"FREUD, THE SECRET PASSION is on of those films which somr idiotic critics have loved to demolish. Yet Huston created a very good fikm. In  choosing Montgomery Clift to play Freud, he could not have taken a better one. Clift with his tormented personality was perfect for the part and Vanessa Redgrave is impressive. The atmosphere of the time (Vienna around the turn of the century) is very well rendered. The dream scenes are artistically re-created. I had to wait so long to , at long last, get the film on DVD (via Spain!) It shows that american companies who release films on DVDs have often no clues about qualities of films. There are right now so many great american films from the past  which are desperately waiting to be released on DVDs but are ignored by dumb ""film specialists"" .One is JUSTINE by CUckor,,,,",1293753600,5,820,4.6482758620689655

Director John Huston's FREUD (1962 is a b&w biopic that stars Montgomery Clift, Susannah York, Larry Parks and in a small role, David McCallum. It covers the life of Sigmund Freud as a young man (age 30) whose ideas on the cause of neuroses and hysterical behavior are loudly rejected by the established Vienna medical community.

It's during his experiments with hypnosis, talk therapy and self-analysis that Freud develops his Oedipus Complex theory, and his conclusion that human sexuality exists even in childhood is instantly jeered by colleagues, even the only one who had previously worked with Freud on cures for patients with purely hysterical symptoms such as uncontrollable shaking, blindness or inability to walk. The film ends on this down note, but the journey to this point is most interesting and includes some fine dream sequences.

Monty Clift is terrific in this dark and unglamorous picture.",1430438400,2,987,5.15625

8413900,5,B0042QR5YC,"My father was a psychiatrist, so I grew up respecting Freud while very aware of the failures and rigidities inherent in his method.  This sparked a lifelong interest on Freud in me, though from a historical perspective rather than as a practitioner.  I have read many histories of the period and about all the other theories that his ideas spawned.

This is an absolutely beautiful dramatization of Freud's greatest period of discovery, when he resisted the prestigious medical establishment in Vienna to forge ahead with his radical theories.  Not only does the film outline the process of scientific discovery, but it presents the basic ideas lucidly and with surprising historical accuracy, given the compromises needed to form a Hollywood narrative.  This is an extraordinary accomplishment, in my opinion.

Through wonderfully dramatic case studies, we experience Freud's development of an new approach to hysteria (that it exists and can be dealt with through hypnosis, involving the re-experiencing of the original trauma and thereby eliminating it for good); the founding of the theory of sexual neurosis (obviously questionable with what we now know with subsequent science) as the principal basis of psychological trauma; the discovery that dreams and free association can lead to communication with the unconscious mind; and finally, the working out of how this should work therapeutically.  Freud explores not just the pathologies of his patients, but his own neuroses, all the while managing his professional and personal relationships.  In my opinion, it is a brilliant success as a drama and an informative documentary - it does not unacceptably over-simplify or transmogrify, but portrays Freud as the brilliant humanist and healer that he was.

This is a pioneering film, I have never seen anything like it as means to transmit ideas.  Recommended with enthusiasm.",1415232000,4,1881,5.36734693877551
