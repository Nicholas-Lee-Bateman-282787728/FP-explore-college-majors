8405623,5,B003U4P0CG,This DVD is a good addition to one's Betty Boop collection.,1481414400,,59,4.454545454545454
8405624,4,B003U4P0CG,"There's a total of 27 public domain Betty Boop cartoons on ECHO BRIDGE's flip-disc DVD, BETTY BOOP - 15 CARTOON CLASSICS. As with other such budget brand offerings, none here are restored, so condition is solely dependent on source material. Fair-to-good is a reasonable expectation.

Excepting four shorts, all of these FLEISCHER Studio releases are post-Production Code Boop, which means she's demurely clothed (by comparison to pre-Code Betty), the plots are geared more to children and often involve regular characters Grampy and Pudgy the pup.
