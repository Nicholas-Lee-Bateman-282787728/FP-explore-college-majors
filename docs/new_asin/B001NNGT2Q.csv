3719851,4,B001NNGT2Q,"Minghags is well worth the purchase if you're looking for an absurd independent comedy. Brandon Dicamillo's several performances are worth the price of the DVD on their own.

If you're familiar with Bam's work, the first thing you'll notice on watching the film is how he and Joe Franz have grown as filmmakers. The script is tighter, for one thing. It's funny and even random without wandering the way Haggard did at times. Gone are the pointless skate montages. Each character is both memorable as well as quotable. Their sense of comic timing has improved as well, resulting in a number of hilarious sight gags.

Some of the critics here have complained about the poor acting. By conventional standards, yes, the Bagger is an awful actor. He smiles at inappropriate times, he is unable to convey any emotion beyond giddy stupor, and he lacks all sense of presence. This is, however, largely the strength of his performance. As Minghags is a quirky comedy, his bad acting only adds to the humor. To complain that the movie features ""bad acting"" is to miss the point entirely.

Dicamello is a joy to watch, both as Ponce and as Rut Ru, as is Ryan Dunn, who plays an ineffectual pushover with painful sincerity. Boof is surprisingly good as the raunchy, oil-scheming mother. You'll have ""Sucking on my toes, ner ner ner ner ner!"" stuck in your head long after the movie ends.

The DVD also comes with hours of bonus material. Some of it pertains directly to the movie, such as the Making-Of featurette and the photo montages. Other things, like the Moxy and Viking Skull music videos, seem like filler waiting for some random project to be attached to. That said, all the bonuses are welcome, even the badly produced mini-documentary on Novak, which comes off as a series of cheap ads for his book.

tl;dr It's good. Buy it.",1236816000,2,1824,4.723270440251572
3719852,5,B001NNGT2Q,this was one of bams best work i loved this movie. it also had some great behinde the scenes on the second disk. and it had a comentary. it also came with a poster and 2 stickers. a must buy!,1236211200,,191,3.8
3719853,1,B001NNGT2Q,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 3 years now, I was a huge fan of Haggard and I was so excited I pre-ordered it thinking it would be the greatest thing ever, well I was completely wrong, now I am  scarred for life and very sad, I wish I had my $20 back so I could do something better with the money like set it on fire! Because that would be much more entertaining than this movie.....",1234915200,,409,3.927710843373494
3719854,5,B001NNGT2Q,"This movie is pretty funny.  It's nowhere near as good as Haggard, but if you are a fan of Bam Margera or his friends and family, then you will like this.  I thought the documentary was better than the film itself.  Also the Dreamseller videos were interesting.  Just don't expect too much from this film.",1233792000,,305,4.490909090909091
3719855,5,B001NNGT2Q,"I have never watched any of the Jackass movies, but I liked Haggard, and I loved Minghags!  Each time I watch it, I notice something new that's funny and enjoy the movie more and more.  It's a great movie to watch when you just need to laugh at silly stuff.  You can feel the joy that went into the making of this movie.  And the cinematography is fantastic.  Anyone who grew up in Pennsylvania will appreciate the scenes especially the roof top shot.

Great movie, lots of fun to watch and laugh at!!!",1233273600,,502,4.344086021505376
3719856,1,B001NNGT2Q,"Minghags might just be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. Trust me it wasn't my idea. A friend had the DVD and being that we are fans of Jackass and some of Bam's other work we decided to pop it in. Wow. One rarely witnesses garbage this bad. I mean its hard to describe but we sat there in silence through the first pointless, and totally unfunny and idiotic 15 minutes. I looked at my friend and he said, ""Trainwreck."" For whatever reason we stayed with the film for another unbelieveable 15 minutes of torture before finally granting mercy for ourselves and depositing this utterly stupid DVD in the trash. I know the internet is filled with thousands of movie reviews and every movie released is probably proclaimed the worst movie of all time by somebody, but I am not exaggerating at all when I tell you this now tops my worst of all-time list. Some movies are bad and stupid on a level that you can have fun with them and appreciate them like ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" No, this one doesn't even give you that side to like. Its just bad.",1231545600,4,1058,4.403061224489796
3719857,5,B001NNGT2Q,"This movie is better and more entertaining the Haggard, and I've watched Haggard more than any other film in my collection. Minhags is far from the HIM music video that filled about half of Haggard. Haha

I'll try not to spoil anything but things like the ""gays"", STD watch, and Bruno make this film great. Brandon DiCamillo plays multiple characters to the finest.

I used to hate the Character Ralph, but have grown to actually like his parts. Brandon Novak plays the ""Gay Biker."" Some of those parts are hard to watch but are some of the funniest scenes in any movie ever.

I guess you have to have a certain sense of humor to like this stuff. But Minghags easily tops 99% of the Hollywood comedies produced. Bam really did deliver with a quality sequel, all the delays in the release were worth the wait.

I LOVE THIS MOVIE.",1231200000,7,828,4.5
3719858,5,B001NNGT2Q,"If you're a fan of the movie Haggard then you'll enjoy this movie. Same humor as Haggard, and Dunn, Dicamillo, Mark The Bagger, and Pop Pop are great.",1374796800,,150,4.392857142857143

3719860,5,B001NNGT2Q,"This movie is hilarious, wild and completely ""outloud"" the sequal to Bam Margeras ""Haggard"" is a must have. Staring your favorate CKY crew. I recommened it to anyone who enjoys jackass, CKY and Haggard.",1358726400,,202,4.970588235294118
3719861,5,B001NNGT2Q,"Such a funny movie, I had tears streaming down my face the whole time. I think this movie is much better than Haggard because half of the movie isn't filled with pointless skating scenes of Bam. It's a very ""screwball"" type of humor that some people find strange, but if you're a fan of Bam and his crew you'll definitely find this as hilarious as I did.",1350000000,,354,4.298507462686567
3719862,1,B001NNGT2Q,"Horrible movie.  Story and acting are worse than home movies and can get very annoying at times.  Unlike Haggard, CKY, or Jackass.  Just a horrible movie all around.  No bright spots.",1349049600,,183,4.806451612903226
3719863,1,B001NNGT2Q,"Like many of the reviews on here, my friend and I were huge fans of Haggard the movie.  We found we could relate to the situations in there and the plot and the characters really were really funny.  We especially loved Dunn's character.  Once it was discovered there was a sequel, it was a must have.  Well, personally, I was very dissapointed once I watched it.

The movie is strange in the effect that it has many of the same cast members as Haggard but they all play different characters...which was confusing if you were considering this a sequel to Haggard.  Haggard was fun to watch even though there is alot of nonsense in it, Minghags was just filled with too much stupidity.  It seemed way more low budget and hacked together then Haggard as well.  There were a few entertaining moments in the movie but overall I just thought the entire movie was lacking.

Mark the Bagger's character was probably the lowest point in the movie, incredibly annoying and not even remotely funny (execpt when Bam's grandfather was insulting him).  Dunn wasn't in it enough (he made Haggard). Novak's character was disgusting and pointless.

If it had a better plot and more intresting and relatable characters then it would be entertaining but Bam and the boys didn't hit a home run on this one in my opinion.  If you're really into the Bam / CKY/ Jackass boys, its worth checking out.  Otherwise, don't waste your time unless you like rediculously stupid humor.  One of the worse movies Ive ever seen.",1342396800,,1493,4.670498084291188
3719864,2,B001NNGT2Q,"This movie was just okay.  I spent alot of money on it but I saw Ryan Dunn running around with see-through boxers and shirtless, I would pay that much again for it because he is GORGEOUS!",1340928000,,187,4.194444444444445
3719865,5,B001NNGT2Q,"While minghags does not seem to directly fall into the Haggard storyline there are some continuations, the diamond mountain bike is back, Dico makes a return as Falco, and a couple others.  None of this matters though, if you are fan of the Jackass crew, or the Bam gang, you do not want to miss this.",1320105600,,301,4.375
3719866,5,B001NNGT2Q,"Minghags is kind of a sequel to Haggard, but the story is behind Dico's Garbage Juciar. It's a very funny and wild movie. It has a basic story line, but also a lot of other things. It's a very good, well made movie.

Great for a Viva la Bam/Jackass fan!",1316995200,,253,4.06
3719867,3,B001NNGT2Q,"As someone who grew up through the Jackass/CKY era of MTV, I've always had a soft spot for Bam Margera and the CKY crew. They all grew up about an hour from me, and while I don't know them, it was always fun to see someone my age just doing whatever they wanted, and busting their ass just to entertain ""me"". Eventually Jackass died, and Bam went out to start doing more of his own thing (Viva La Bam and Haggard). To me, Haggard was a great movie, and having the CKY boys involved just made it that much more entertaining. Once I saw that there was another movie made by Bam (Minghags), I had really high hopes that it would be just as good, if not better, then Haggard was. Unfortunately, Minghags falls flat on a lot of points, and is an average at best film.

The plot of Minghags is simple yet completely ridiculous at the same time. For those who saw Bam's film Haggard, Minghags is a sequel of sorts to that film. Someone has stolen the plans from to the Garbage Juicer from the Invention of the Future contest, and it's a race to get the plans back before they're sold for the proverbial fat cash. As with Haggard, Minghags has a bunch of small side plots that all interlace with the Juicer theft, but none of the plots in the film really make sense. The movie is basically just a lot of insane scenes crammed together to make a ""film"". After seeing Haggard, I was actually really excited when Bam was doing another film, because while there was some silliness involved with Haggard, there was still an actual film to watch wrapped around the comedy parts. Minghags doesn't have this at all, and It's hard to even summarize what all the different plot points are, because there's so many tiny trivial parts to it, that it barely makes any sort of sense.

As for the visual aspects of the film, it's standard fare for any CKY/Bam production. There's nothing special about it, and it uses the same usual tricks that Bam and Joe Franz always use: scenes sped up for extended periods of time, ""scenic"" shots of West Chester (or what I'm going to assume is West Chester as usual), and off colored filters on the lens to produce a surreal effect. After seeing the same shots over and over (for years between all of Bam's different projects at this point), it's just extremely boring and lackluster to watch once again.

The one thing that does make the film interesting is the fact that anyone who's close to Bam is in this film. One of the best things always portrayed in any video Bam has ever been a part of, is the fact that you can tell everyone is geniunely friends, and enjoy what they're doing because they're all so close. Any dialog spoken always just sounds like dialog between friends, versus actors reading a script to each other. When I say anyone who's close to Bam, let me give you a quick rundown.

The movie has : CKY (the band), Ryan Dunn, Rake Yohn, DiCo, Brandon Novak, Bam's grandparents, Don Vito, Mark The Bagger, Jimmy Pop and Evil Jared from Bloodhound Gang, The Dudesons...As you can see, basically anyone who Bam has been in any sort of extended contact with in his life made it in. It makes the films much more endearing with the fact that no matter how famous he is (or was), he always kept his friends with him, and always put them in everything he did.

Minghags is basically a semi-entertaining indie film that could have been something great, but turned out to just be an average film at best. If you dug Jackass and the CKY movies back in the late 90s, or you dug Haggard, I would at least give the movie a rental to check out, but I wouldn't recommend it as a purchase to anyone.",1280188800,,3617,4.400597907324364

3719869,2,B001NNGT2Q,"This movie was terrible. I thought Haggard was bad and then I saw this piece of garbage. I love Bam, Bran, Ryan and Raab but they really need to stick to what they're good at which is making CKY movies. These pathetic attempts at screenplays are just embarrassing. Bran's character is annoying as hell in this movie and didn't make me laugh once. The Ralph character was equally as annoying and equally as unfunny. The acting was terrible the plot was terrible the movie was just all around terrible. I won't be watching any more movies by Bam until they get back to the prank/stunt/skateboarding movies because they are going downhill fast right now.",1269907200,,651,4.719298245614035
3719870,3,B001NNGT2Q,"After reading alot of other peoples reviews and seeing the movie, I've made my own judgement.
This is not Haggard and never will be. I'm not saying Minghags was bad but it didn't live up to the hype that Haggard left us with. This movie left me feeling unsatisfied. It was still good in it's own way but the originality just didn't seem to be there this time around.
(""We've got the time...and the cash! Let's make another movie!"")
For the die-hard Bam and CKY crew fans this will just be another movie to add to the collection. For the picky eater...I might not recommend this one. Maybe go back for another helping of Haggard to get your fill.

3719871,1,B001NNGT2Q,"This movie is terrible!!! Haggard was an amazing piece of work, and I loved every second of it. But I could barely sit through the whole movie of Minghags! The only reason I did, was because I wanted to see how funny it would be and if it would get any better at all. But of course it didnt. I will admit, there were some funny parts, but theres just too much going on to even follow along. Theres way too many characters, and way too many stories in the movie I had no idea what was going on! To be honest I have no idea what the plot of this movie is, if there even is one. Theres just too much going on and its hard to follow along. I loved Haggard because it was a simple story, only the necessary characters needed, and the amazing filming and editing. I loved all the skate scenes, and it was a non stop laugh riot!! Minghags is the exact opposite!! i don't know how they can call it a sequal. The ONLY thing it has in common with Haggard, is the actors, and the garbage juicer. but they don't even have the same characters. They don't even have Raab Himself in it!! And he was the funniest one in Haggard!! and Dico uses his deep metal head voice through the entire movie, and its very annoying. Probably the only good thing about this movie was that the Dudesons were in it, and even though they weren't really interacting with the other characters, they were kind of in their own scenes doing their stunts, which was pretty funny. but other than that, this movie sucked and i cant believe i wasted my money on it. It did come with a poster, and a bunch of stickers too, but since the movie sucked then that stuff doesnt really mean anything to me. I highly suggest renting before buying, so that way you can decide for yourself if its worth paying for. I don't think it was at all. I would rather buy a second copy of Haggard than buy this movie, which I wish I would have done!!!!

But, staying true to the crew, i bought the movie on the fact that i think they are amazing, and im a big fan. I was very pleased when i saw the movie, I really like it, but i think you have to be a big fan of Bam and his work.
