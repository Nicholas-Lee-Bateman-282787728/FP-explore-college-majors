8648682,3,B00J84NDQW,It is at its best showing the land around and town of Taos. Jeff Bridges plays a jerk very well and didn't chew on the scenery (maybe because there is a lot of dust). It must have been one of Ralph Bellamy's last roles but he is still good. The rest of the cast are all competent and well suited to their roles. I suspect everyone involved had a grand time being in Taos but knew there would be no Academy Awards.,1500422400,,413,4.048780487804878
8648683,4,B00J84NDQW,"For years and years, I have been trying to find a copy of this 1975 TV pilot. It was made during the height of the ""alien astronauts"" craze, but it was an interesting ""quest"" story about an artifact of possibly alien origin that was broken up into 9 pieces. By the end of the pilot, Our Heroes had some of the pieces in hand, and more possible adventures ahead. I looked forward to seeing the series that came out of this pilot, but alas, it was not picked up.

In the last couple of years, Amazon made this pilot available on DVD through the Warner Archives, and I have been hesitant to buy it, for fear I would be disappointed. It does have a vintage 1970's ""movie of the week"" feel, some archaic technology is unavoidably in use (like rotary dial telephones), and some of the plot is quite predictable, but it holds up rather well. I am very happy to have it in my home library.",1496102400,2,881,4.275449101796407

8648686,3,B00J84NDQW,"I vaguely recalled seeing this made-for-TV film when it first broadcast in the mid 1970s, and was glad to be able to watch it again. It was intended as a pilot for a series which never materialized. Nice premise. It is NOT a big-budget production and it shows, and it is not especially clever, but it is enjoyable and, yeah, it would be nice to see the full story. Cast is decent.",1453420800,2,380,4.291666666666667
8648687,4,B00J84NDQW,"Just finished watching ""Search For The Gods"" released by Warner Brothers Archive Collection.
I remember when ""Search For The Gods"" first aired on television as an original movie/series pilot back on television.  It was one of those movies which conflicted with my bed time on a school night, so I only got to see about 30 minutes of it before it was reluctantly off to the Kingdom of Nod.
The popularity of Erich von Daniken's creative interpretations of possible ancient alien visitations in his highly speculative non-fiction book ""Chariots of the Gods"" served as the impetus for this made-for-television movie.
What surprised me about ""Search For the Gods"" was the sexual undertones that run deep throughout this movie.  Yes, sex does happen in this movie; and there is a hint, just a hint, mind you, that the two male leads are bi-sexual due to the language in the prison scene.
The plot is rather simple:  a drifter on the run from life, rescues an American Indian holy man from two fellow Indian thugs who want him to hand over an ancient medallion that is part of a larger medallion that was broken into nine separate pieces - one being in the hands of a mysterious millionaire collector who will authorize his personal assistants to kill to get all the other pieces.
The medallion is made of an unknown material and has a mysterious, undecipherable language on it.
""Search For The Gods"" was also novelized.
The mystery as to what the medallion actually is and what it may lead to is only hinted at and never fully realized.  Spoiler alert - while a tomb does have an alien looking coffin lid, it contains just a human skeleton.
Recommended.

8648690,5,B00J84NDQW,"An entertaining movie from my youth with a very '70s feel too it. Anyone interested in TV sci-fi from that era would enjoy this movie,especially if you are interested in Erich von Daniken and ""Chariots of the Gods"" type explorations. Also, if you are a Kurt Russell fan, this might be one that you've missed.",1411603200,6,308,4.618181818181818
