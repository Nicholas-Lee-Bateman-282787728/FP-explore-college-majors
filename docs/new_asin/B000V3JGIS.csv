2928821,4,B000V3JGIS,"The whole family has been enjoying the original Adams Family series.

All 3 seasons in one box set. Some could complain that they are flip side discs, but just stick a cloth in the case if it bothers you.

My parents watched this when it started, I enjoyed growing up watching it, and even my 8 year old niece loves it.

How could you not love this timeless classic of a deranged and strange family that poke fun at normal living and flip reality around to make it a fun half hour show with true morals and fun zany comedy.

The DVD's come complete with all 3 seasons, digitally remastered, subtitles in yellow (important to those who care) and a few bonus features here and there.

The Addams Family still hold up well with todays audience both young and old and I can't see why anyone would ever have anything bad to say about one of the all time great comedy series.

The bonus features on the first season show a heap of interviews, and behind the scenes stuff, interesting to watch for any fan. The other discs mostly contain an audio commentary here and there, and some silly Audio Commentaries to a scene by Cousin Itt and Thing.

I bought the region 1 version cause it is half the price of the Australian release. And I am not at all disappointed with the purchase of this great timeless classic.

The only reason I won't give a perfect 5 stars is because it was the perfect opportunity to include the 1977 Halloween (reunion) show they did, and was the only Adams Family of the series in color. Had that have been included, I would have been very happy with the bonus content.",1196035200,106,1585,4.404109589041096
2928822,5,B000V3JGIS,"I just purchased the third volume of the Addams Family TV show and it was comprised of three double-sided discs.  Unless I got some cheap version from Wal-Mart, and there is a nicer 6-disc version out there, then I'm sure the early reports were wrong, and this volume also has just three discs.  (Hence the Complete Series having only 9 discs...)
The packaging is in the same condition as the previous volumes, so I doubt there's more than one version out there.  Anyhow, unless The Complete Series has any special features that are going to be outrageously different or exciting, I'd recommend you just stick to the three volumes.  I bought them all for about $20/each, and with the new edition coming in at around $70, buying them separately is a better deal anyway.
And for the record, The Addams Family is far superior to The Munsters, for me, and the DVDs I have for the show are great!",1189641600,43,891,4.584905660377358
2928823,5,B000V3JGIS,"The Addams Family TV show was based on a series of cartoons started back in the 1930's and authored by Charles Addams for the New Yorker. Whether or not Addams intended for there to be some kind of Depression-era message on the idle rich being scary in more ways than one I do not know, but it does seem like that is one of the messages trying to come through all the dark humor. What I do know is that a show this offbeat and creative would never get aired on network TV today, and even if it did, the minute it got successful the network suits would start tinkering with it and ruin it. If you need an example of this phenomena, I point you in the direction of Lost.

The Addams' are portrayed as a close knit and happy family - in fact they rarely have contact with outsiders other than the children attending school. They appear completely human, but they eat food that seems completely inedible by any normal human being and they each have their own peculiar qualities that seem beyond those of normal humans such as Uncle Fester's ability to generate electricity. If they do have visitors, they are usually other family members from some remote area who display these same characteristics. The show never explains the origin of the Addams' or their great wealth - that's just part of their intrigue. There are a few episodes here and there that reference  popular culture as it existed then such as ""Lurch the Teenage Idol"" which pokes fun of the early Beatles and similar rock bands of the time. For the most part, though, the show is pretty much timeless and thus is still funny today.

all 64 episodes are spread across 9 double-sided discs in this set. Episodes are presented in Full Frame with English, French and Spanish audio and English and Spanish subtitles. The specific list of extra features include:

Audio commentary for ""The Addams Family Goes To School"", ""Morticia, The Matchmaker"" and ""Cousin Itt Visits The Addams Family"" featuring cast members Lisa Loring, Ken Weatherwax and Felix Silla with ""The Addams Chronicles"" author Stephen Cox and director Arthur Hiller.

Thing and Cousin Itt select scene commentary on ""Thing is Missing"", ""My Son, the Chimp"", ""Cousin Itt and the Vocational Counsellor"", ""My Fair Cousin Itt"" ""Morticia's Dilemma"", ""Ophelia Finds Romance"" and ""Lurch's Little Helper"".

Commentary by Steven Cox, author of ""The Addams Chronicles"" on ""Morticia Meets Royalty"" and ""Morticia the Decorator"".

Tombstone Trivia on ""Morticia's Romance"" (Part I) and ""Cat Addams"".

""You Rang, Mr. Addams"" - featurette

""Snap, Snap"" - featurette

""The Addams Family Portrait"" featurette including on-camera interviews with John Astin.

""Mad About The Addams"" featurette

""Guest Star Sance"" with Parley Baer, Milton Frome, Vito Scotti, Elizabeth Fraser, Richard Deacon, Sig Ruman, Margaret Hamilton, Elvia Allman, Eddie Quillan and Peter Bonerz.

2928824,1,B000V3JGIS,i can't stand this set and the separate releases. all they do is freeze up on several episodes. mgm did a horrendous job putting these together. they should have found a better studio to do the job.one that would have the cuts to put in all the deleted scenes. i'm just too filled with rage to go on. i'm seriously considering breaking  every disc and throwing the whole damn thing out.

The series only ran two seasons, but the episodes are divided into three volumes for this set.  However, it's worth remembering that in the mid-sixties a season was 30+ episodes so there's plenty of entertainment to be had.

The discs are double-sided so you need to be careful in handling them, but they all worked great for me. I'm enjoying the show very much!",1498608000,4,592,4.784313725490196

2928921,5,B000V3JGIS,"The Addams Family.  Hardly an adult in the United States doesn't know who it is and practically all can sing (or at least hum) the theme song.  Gomez (John Astin), is the family patriarch.  If ever there was a person absolutely right a role, he is the one.  Morticia (Carolyn Jones) plays the perfect foil and wifre to Gomez.  She is sleek, always in deep thought and, for television of the time, sexy as they come.  She can bring Gomez to his knees by speaking French.  Ted Cassidy, an absolute favorite in the role of Lurch, the family's butler, plays one of the most stoic straight man in the biz.  While ""only"" 6'9"" (compared to the 7' Karel Struycken of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Addams-Family/dp/B0035LJY6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Addams Family</a>&nbsp;movies), Cassidy towers over the rest of the family.

Astin's zaniness, Uncle Fester's (Jackie Coogan) inventions, child siblings Wednesday and Pugley's adventures at school and Morticia's keeping them all grounded makes for great television viewing.  As a note of mention, one of the original writers, Harry Winkler was also a writer for the short lived New Addams Family series.  Greatness never dies.",1467331200,4,1477,6.116504854368932

The family is different that what you know. It seems to be Halloween crossed with comedy all the time. Mrs. Mortica Addams had long black hair and long black dress. She was Goth way before it was a fad. Here husband Gomez invested in stock among other things. He like consolidated fuzz and lint stocks the best. It shows the showed the adventures that the family got into.

This show was duplicated by many actors. In fact today the debate between Addams family and Munster's still goes on. If heard it debated at the bar on Cheers tv show.

2928999,5,B000V3JGIS,"Some shows are not as enjoyable as you remember them from childhood--I'm happy to say that ""The Addams Family"" is even better than I recalled!  The humor stands up to the test ot time, even excells.  And, unlike ""The Munsters"" show, the comedy does not involve mocking the father or any other family member.  Instead, there is a great deal of love demonstrated in the family.  Further, Morticia and Gomez display passion and devotion to each other, not viewed in other shows of that television era.

The show was filmed in black-and-white, but the picture and sound are very clear on the DVDs.  Production evidently tried to conserve money on the show by occasionally reusing a bit of film--for example, phone calls to Dr. Mbongo--and by using only a limited number of sets, but neither is overdone or detracts from the show.  Some gags were repeated--strangers' reaction to Lurch, Fester lighting up a lightbulb in his mouth--but the show was careful not to over-rely on these for the comedy.

I dislike that the DVDs are double-sided; I wish manufacturers did not do this.  Fortunately, the box packaging is sturdy and protects them well.  I am delighted the receive the complete series, unedited.",1421280000,20,1199,4.891089108910891

2929004,5,B000V3JGIS,"It's great to have the complete series of ""The Addams Family"" in one box set.  Despite the fact that they're kooky, spooky, and all together ooky, the Addams was a very functional and loving family.  The cast was uniformly superb.  Gomez Addams (John Astin) and his wife Morticia (Carolyn Jones) were passionately in love.  Their displays of affection were somewhat shocking for a 1960's TV series, but are tame by today's standards. Jackie Coogan was a consummate professional as Uncle Fester, infusing his character with a Curly Howard quality.  Ted Cassidy showed a real flair for comedy as Lurch, especially in the episodes ""Lurch Learns To Dance,"" ""Lurch, The Teenage Idol,"" ""Lurch's Little Helper,"" and ""Lurch's Grand Romance.""

In addition, the DVD includes hilarious audio commentaries by Cousin Itt and Thing for select scenes, which contain captions for better comprehension.  Speaking of audio commentaries, you haven't lived until you've heard ""The Addams Family"" in French and Spanish!  The one complaint I have is the fact that the episodes are on double-sided discs.  This makes them easier to get scratched or otherwise damaged.  In fact, the first box set I bought included defective DVDs, and had to be exchanged.  Fortunately, all of the discs in the replacement box set played perfectly.  Despite all that, fans of ""The Addams Family"" should not hesitate to buy this box set.",1420761600,31,1395,5.123893805309734

This complete set is basically all three volumes in an outer box. There are ""Select Scene"" commentaries on select episodes. There are about 5 or 6 bonus features. Little things like a run down of guest stars with clips to Mini 12-15 min documentaries

My main issues is with the packaging. I had some high hopes because from what I had read the individual season releases of The Munsters were dual side discs, but the complete collection was single sided. I had hoped the same treatment was given to The Addams Family however this was not the case. as mentioned above unless you don't own any of the Volumes there does not seem to be anything special about the series set.",1415232000,,752,4.449275362318841

2929049,3,B000V3JGIS,"Don't let the 3 stars dissuade you from checking the series out if you're into old school humor - this is certainly a well-made show, and a good watch for those looking for light entertainment with a tinge of dark humor thrown in. I watched the entire series recently, and while it's entertaining, it plays things a bit too safe - I only laughed out loud a few times during some of the quick, witty moments. It might be better received by kids or teens, especially with Halloween coming up.

There are 3 main problem I had with the show:
1 - For the first half of this collection (the first season and a half I think), many of the gags are reused over and over. Maybe it was funny to see Thing deliver the mail to Morticia the first time, but is it really laugh out loud funny the 30th time? This leads me to...
2 - The laugh track is way overdone. It's annoying how the ""audience"" laughs after every line, even when it's one of the oft-repeated gags. They also wait until each line is delivered fully, while in real life people would start giggling part of the way through.
3 - Camera tricks - there's far too much reused footage in the show, and too many places where the film is sped up, slowed down, or frozen. I understand we're talking about a black and white show from the mid 60's, but things could have been played a little straighter for more deadpan humor.

The DVD presentation is pretty good, and there are a few commentaries and other features here and there. The series does get better towards the end, with more characters introduced and broader plots explored (one of my favorites is when Morticia becomes a decorator and basically turns the house next door into a wasteland).",1412380800,7,1693,4.423076923076923

The US version is censored and this version is not.  In the original broadcasts, Morticia sings the song ""It's So Nice to Have a Man Around the House"", but MGM did not have the rights to this song for the US release and replaced her singing with different lyrics.

This is one of the great tv comedies -- the humor is timeless and holds up even today after almost 50 years. And it was a ""sweet"" comedy, swirling around the love between Gomez and Morticia and their simple joy of being alive. Today's comedies are largely based on personal insults between characters and jokes on the misfortunes of others, I never understood the humor in that. Anyway, the Addams Family is fun to watch and leaves you with a smile. And Carolyn Jones as Morticia lights up the screen every time, She was my first boyhood crush! So get this collection.

2929080,5,B000V3JGIS,"this is my first complete TV series that i ever bought and one hell of an amazing show

i first know the Addams family when i was watching the Cartoon Network version of them in 1992 ( wish they release a DVD collection already  )

that said i watched some episodes  and i really loved it  and decided to get this set and it is worth it for its cracking entertainment factor and a classic Addams experience .

i'm new to this TV series  and it never let me down i'm having allot of got time with it and i haven't finished the first set yet

as for the colorful cast  Morticia is my favorite & the reason i liked the Addams family in the first place Carolyn Jones ( R I P  ) was sooooo beautiful and fitting for her roll  ,  gomez in this series i find him better than in the CN cartoon tho its a very close call  ,  Lurch is my 2nd favorite in this family specially when he mumbles ( specially when bank robbers found him in the closet  )

as for the kids Pugsley and Wednesday  they are adorable here  unlike the impish siblings in the 1992 cartoon ( which i prefer  )  ,  OOHHH BOY Uncle fester  he always cracks me up the family is nothing without him  yet i cant decide both this and the cartoon Fester are REALLY good ... tho the cartoon Fester is more crazy ( LOL )

as of cousin IT & thing  there amazingly the same from this series and the cartoon which is neat cuz it made me feel its a continuation in my imagination of these too .

as for the case box i love it  , as for the label issue cuz i found it amazing that the DVDs are played both sides ( 1st time i see it in my life  )  ,  but look closely in the center ring of one of the sides of any of them and it will show which side the DVD your going to play  , as well the writing of each episode is found the opposite  inner side of the cover  so its no big deal as i red from reviews .

2929126,5,B000V3JGIS,"THE ADDAMS FAMILY-THE COMPLETE SERIES: Its sister series THE MUNSTERS may have been a slightly more conventional ""family sitcom"" clothed in Universal monster costumes, but THE ADDAMS FAMILY, based on cartoonist CHARLES ADDAMS' wonderfully macabre drawings, was a decidedly twisted, darkly humorous delight. JOHN ASTIN's bug eyed eccentric millionaire GOMEZ (whose hobbies including wrecking toy trains, sword swallowing and standing on his head) played enthusiastically off CAROLYN JONES' cooly detached, eerily beautiful MORTICIA. Their bizarre mansion housed, among other peculiarities, man-eating plant CLEOPATRA, a torture chamber referred to as ""the playroom"" and THING, a disembodied ""helping hand"" in a box. Freaky family members included JACKIE COOGAN's skin-headed electric personality UNCLE FESTER (whose mouth served as a light bulb socket), the hair-engulfed, chipmunk-voiced COUSIN ITT, two dead pan kids and LURCH, the harpisichord-loving, monosyllabic man servant, played to gravel-voiced perfection by six foot nine inch TED CASSIDY. VIC MIZZY's finger-snapping sing along theme, guillotine sharp writing, and inspired casting made THE ADDAMS FAMILY (which spawned two cartoon series, a major motion picture remake and a stage musical) the hip place to visit for two brief, but frightfully perfect seasons.

2929150,4,B000V3JGIS,"The darkly humorous cartoons of Charles Addams, were used as the basis for the television series The Addams Family (1964-66) which ran on ABC for two seasons.  Working with the cartoonist, the series creators named the previously unnamed characters, put them together as a family, and came up with the concept of featuring a family with a dark and weird lifestyle.  The after the idealistic portrayals of families in the 50's, a number of wacky variations of domestic life came to prime time.  The Addams Family, The Munsters, Bewitched, and The Beverly Hillbillies, to name a few, were part of this trend.

The Addams Family featured John Astin as wealthy Gomez Addams, a lawyer and dabbler in the stock market.  Carolyn Jones is his cultured wife Morticia, whose hobbies include raising carnivorous plants.  Former child star Jackie Coogan is Uncle Fester, a strange fellow who can power a light bulb by sticking it in his mouth.  Blossom Rock (Marie Blake) is Grandmama, a harmless witch.  Ted Cassidy is Lurch, the butler, who entertains the family by playing the harpsichord.  The Addams' children are played by Ken Weatherwax as the adventurous Pugsley, and Lisa Loring as the gloomy Wednesday.  Thing, the disembodied hand in a box, is a most unique character, adapted from a Charles Addams' creation.  Hairy cousin Itt (Felix Silla/Anthony Magro) was a reoccurring character, not created by Addams.  Most of the action, takes place inside or around the Addams' mansion.  With its assortment of strange objects, torture devices, animals, and exotic displays, the residence is almost like another character.

Most of the humor is related to the family's eccentric behavior, and strange habits, such as Gomez and Morticia fencing in the living room, Gomez practicing yoga or deliberately crashing electric trains, and the family going out at night to get a moontan.  Some humor involves references to strange things that are never seen, such as dining on yak, Wednesday's pet spiders, Grandmama's alligator wrestling, or Pugsley's fondness for playing with dynamite.

The program also has some provocative elements.  One is Gomez's amorous behavior towards Morticia, usually initiated whenever she speaks French.  Kissing the arm is funny, but when overdone, gets weird and creepy.  The program also features torture devices, like the rack, vise, pillory, and bed of nails, as ""therapeutic"" devices to relieve aches and pains.  Despite the goofy elements, with its mature sensibilities, The Addams Family probably plays better to an adult audience.  Producer Nat Perrin wrote for the Marx Brothers, and there is clearly a lot of Groucho Marx in Gomez's personality and mannerisms.

Mostly confined to the mansion, and with central characters that don't have jobs, apparently made coming up with fresh ideas a challenge at times.  The Addams' residence becomes the frequent destination of various relatives, and an assortment of visitors.  Although they tried to mix things up, after a while, some of the repetitious gags (trick gate/doorbell, walkthrough by Kitty the lion, the stuffed bear and mounted moose and fish head) no longer have much effect.  To their credit, some of the older gags are replaced with new ones, as the funroom is replaced by things like Gomez using a trampoline, and Morticia plucking on a samisen.

Both cool, and vulnerable, Lurch is a terrific character.  Stories featuring him are almost always winners.  Ted Cassidy doesn't say much, but his talent definitely shines through from under the makeup.  Too bad he wasn't featured more than he was.  Fester and Gomez are generally the most animated and quick to act.  Jackie Coogan brings energy to his performance, but Fester also isn't in the spotlight much, and some of the stories featuring him are weak.  Still, the character shows a lot of growth, from a just guy who sticks a light bulb in his mouth.  Gomez is impulsive and involved in many activities that keep the series interesting.  His impetuousness is countered by the more rational Morticia, the anchor who generally keeps things under control.  Morticia has wacky moments, but they are seldom extreme.  Carolyn Jones also appears as Morticia's unbalanced sister Ophelia, a character that allows Jones to shed the tight black dress, and display more eccentric sides of her personality.

Appearances by the remaining cast was a little spotty, as Blossom Rock appeared in less than half the episodes.  Minors Ken Weatherwax and Lisa Loring had limited availability, and Pugsley and Wednesday, really aren't around as much as you might think.  Lisa Loring grew up a lot between the two seasons.  Helping to fill in the gaps, Cousin Itt was introduced in Episode 20, and appeared in 24 episodes.  For whatever reasons, the supporting cast wasn't featured as well as they might have been.

The Munsters were on the air at exactly the same time period (1964-66), but unlike the Addams the Munsters were not rich.  They frequently left their Mockingbird Lane home, and faced many zany situations and interacted with all kinds of people.  Herman Munster's many activities included bronco riding, pro wrestling, playing for the LA Dodgers, drag racing, and even becoming a pop singer.  Lily, Grampa, Eddie, and Herman, all wore greenish makeup.  Grampa could turn into a bat or a wolf, and concocted magic potions.  Eddie went to school, and Marilyn dated.  While the Addams' were affluent homebodies with macabre tastes, the Munsters were working class with an active lifestyle similar to the average American family.  The approaches taken by the two programs were very different, but with more of an appeal to kids, it's not surprising that The Munsters was more popular.  While the Addams were home, the Munsters were taking on the world.  Strangely although popular, both programs were cancelled after just two seasons.

MGM Studios (now in bankruptcy) decided to break the two seasons (64 episodes), into three ""volumes"".  The complete series set is a compilation of the three volumes, on double sided discs.  The episodes are subtitled (handy when foreign languages are spoken).  Cast members Ken Weatherwax, Lisa Loring, and Felix Silla, along with author Stephen Cox, contribute commentary tracks for several episodes, but it would have been nice to hear more from John Austin.  Also included is a featurette recognizing the valuable contributions of composer Vic Mizzy.

The Addams Family is a unique comedy with a dark quirky sense of humor.  While successfully making the transformation from a cartoon to a 60's classic, the series doesn't quite reach the potential it could have, though it's still a wacky and fun blast from the past.",1303603200,4,6683,5.135185185185185
2929151,5,B000V3JGIS,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

I love ""The Addams Family.""  Starring John Astin(Sean's dad), Carolyn Jones, and Jackie Coogan, it's a classic series. It's slightly cheesy, but also so fun and darkly creative that I loved it as an eleven year old watching reruns in the late 1980's.

At the risk of offending fans of ""The Munsters,"" I think ""The Addams Family"" is an overall better show.  Creativity is pouring out of the corners here.  Names like Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Lurch, Uncle Fester and Cousin Itt pull the viewer in immediately.  The whole enterprise became more obviously dark with the release of the movies of the 1990's, which I also appreciate.  But, even in this show, an occasional joke comes across with a dark edge.

I'd like to see the complete series.  Of course, the customer won't be getting the dramatic arcs we've come to expect on contemporary TV, but this is a fun, great series.",1299110400,2,896,4.803921568627451

Thing keeps putting his hand in.  Uncle Fester is an effeminate doofus.  The kids are misfits in normal society, etc.

There are funny moments, but this program can wear thin if you watch more than one episode per month.

It was only on network TV for two seasons, and was still doing well in the ratings when it was cancelled. It was shown in re-runs for many years after the show went off the air.

The most amazing thing about this show is that it actually was as good as we remembered! The humor varies from slapstick to very clever word play that makes this enjoyable for most age ranges.

The picture\audio quality is very good and the episodes are shown in their entirety, which is great since I was used to seeing them cut down to fit network commercial constraints.

I truly enjoy watching older series on DVD and perhaps wouldn't have turned off my cable service if shows of this caliber were still being produced today.

Highly Recommended!

The shows are cute, clever, and well done.  They still hold up, and the acting, production values and the actors themselves are fun to see.  I would take these over today's poor excuse for entertainment.  Well worth the price.",1279584000,3,307,4.648148148148148
2929162,5,B000V3JGIS,"Note: I meant to put this with my Wonder Woman review but I forgot (regarding if this one posts before that). Instead of reviewing each season of a particular series and feel like I'm repeating myself in terms of praise or criticism, I'll just be reviewing the complete collection and give my thoughts on the series as a whole instead of the individual season releases.

The Addams Family has always been one of my favorites, whether it be the movies (except Reunion, I only saw that once and can't really remember much about it), animated incarnations (except the 1973 series which I never saw) or television remakes. And since I was exposed to them first, I prefer them to The Munsters (expect me to make comparisons but remember its only my opinion so don't hate me for it). I'm sure there's people who saw the Addams first and still like the other or vice versa but that's just the way I am (much like my view on Bewitched and Jeannie though both are good).

First off, the actors. While there are quite a few episodes that feature the entire family, most episodes feature Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Lurch, Thing and later Cousin Itt. John Astin, though not Spanish like Raul Julia in the film, plays Gomez with a thirst for life. He's energetic, passionate to his wife (rarely, if never, seen between spouses on television. The only examples of husbands and wives showing emotion to eachother are Lucy & Ricky  and Samantha & Darrin [mainly when Dick York played the role]) and loves his family. Carolyn Jones as Morticia, again displays many of the qualities I see in Astin. Though Morticia is clearly the head of the family and adores her husband (the way she turns Gomez on at the drop of a hat whenever she speaks French astounds me). Jones and Astin had a chemistry that you don't see nowadays. Like York and Montgomery from Bewitched, this is a rare chemistry that is displayed by actors, mainly by actors who aren't married or in a relationship with actor that's playing the significant other is when its most believable. Rarely has it been displayed by actors who were married, such as Lucy and Desi. They were also a more believable couple than Lily and Herman (not saying the actors who played were bad), who suffered from the same thing that other sitcoms with married couples had. I also don't get why the general public feared the Addams family though they looked normal, while the Munsters were at least accepted but people were still scared of them yet were technically the Universal Monsters domesticated. Anyway back to the Addams. Lisa Loring and Ken Weatherwax play Wednesday and Pugsley, not as how they're done nowadays in the films and cartoons, but more or less as a brother and sister who have macabre tastes. A shame that more episodes weren't devoted to them as they're good actors (wow, I can't believe I found child actors that're...good!) but thems the brakes with the labor laws. Jackie Coogan is hilarious as Uncle Fester, making me crack up everytime he says ""I'll shoot 'im in the back!"". Blossom Rock as Grandmama is good in her own right, but like the children, most episodes don't feature her by having the character off-screen doing stuff with the children. Ted Cassidy is funny as Lurch, with his classic line ""You Rang"" along with some great facial expressions. Thing (played by Cassidy or, if Lurch and Thing featured in the same scene, by a production assistant), can equally be funny and surprisingly (for a hand) has more episodes given to him over the children or Mama. And last there's Cousin Itt. He's a walking pile of hair that makes high-pitched sounds more pleasing to the ear than the actual dialog from the Chipmunks. There are a few other relatives or recurring characters (Jones as Morticia's sister Ophelia, Margaret Hamilton as Morticia's mother), Sam Hilliard (who goes from one occupation to another thanks to the family) but they're really not worth mentioning as they rarely show up.

The dialog and writing is witty, thanks mainly to Nat Perrin, who had worked with the Marx Bros., making the humor in this a little more sophisticated than The Munsters, in which the comedy always felt forced. Both seasons were consistent in the quality of writing, direction and acting, never straining from what they established with their first episode. Favorite episodes would be the two-part Morticia's Romance (which includes my favorite exchange between Morticia and Gomez), Amnesia in the Addams Family, The Addams Family Meets the Spacemen/VIPS, Happy Birthday Granny Frump and many others. The effects were decent but I don't think there was a big budget in that department. The shot of Gomez's wrecked trains was shot for the first episode then used when needed. A couple other shots might be stock as well but aren't as noticeable. A great series that was canceled before its time. Granted it would've been weird to see it in color but at least they would've been regularly colored when compared to the Munsters' movie(s) (not sure if there were two or not) where everybody was green. But to the show's defense, it and the Addams Family had good ratings before they were yanked off the air and I don't think there's every been a good reason for it either.",1275609600,3,5221,4.778516057585825

2929168,5,B000V3JGIS,"I have been a fan of The Addams Family since it was first aired back in the good old days.  Over the years, I have seen the ""sliced and diced"" versions on TV with many scenes being deleted.  I had actually purchased two DVD sets in the past of The Addams Family only to find they were pirated versions.  Someone actually taped the sliced and diced versions from TV, converted them to DVD, packaged and sold them.  The quality of one was so bad, I returned it, and demanded my money back.  Initially, the seller refused to refund my money but I eventually got it.  The second one was not much better, but was better than nothing, until now.  Well, I guess finally the real Addams Family survivors sold the copy right of the new version of the Addams Family was made available.

I love it.  Once it arrived, I came home EVERY night from work to watch as many shows as I could.  It was excellent, the quality is great and the extra features and bonus items were completely enjoyable.  I have recommended it to many people, and even fans of the Munsters, which I plan to add to my collection very soon.

The COMPLETE Series is complete, and as of 11/22/09, is the only way to get a commercial, studio-released complete set of the awesome series.
What we needed in this set was the 1977 Halloween with the Addams Family as an extra. Now that as far as I know they didn't do it, PLEASE release it separately on a good quality DVD release! What a great opportunity to have a great extra on this set, the only Addams Family in color, as far as I know.
It is worth gwtting the complete series, not some 3 volume partial set, which they should have never done.
People who want classic shows want the COMPLETE series, and they did this with the release of this DVD set.
I didn't give it 5 starts because they blew it by not including the Halloween special from 1977, and they used double-sided discs from what I can tell from other information.

2929172,5,B000V3JGIS,The Addams Family is a wonderful show.  The subversively gothic family is a classic 60s show with all the usual sitcom elements of the time.  The family is eccentric and scares outsiders away.  Morticia and Gomez are great fun as the loving couple.  The two children show up only intermittently until late in the 2nd season.  Jackie Coogan plays the wonderful Uncle Fester while Grandma is a wonderful addition.  I was always a bigger fan of The Munsters but watched this show occasionally with repeats.

2929174,5,B000V3JGIS,"I ordered this during the 2008 Christmas season so my young daughters could watch it during their time off during the holidays.  We put in the first disc and watched the fist episode.  From that point forward is was basically two months of a chant in chorus: ""Addams Family! Addams Family!""  They watched it straight through and then went through it again and again, perhaps a total of five times. They still won't let me pack it away, they want it readily available.

I didn't complain too much, because to my delight I found that this show, like so many from the era, is simple astonishingly good television.  I had enjoyed it as a kid, but I didn't remember it as well as the Munsters (which is also, obviously, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED).  The creativity of this production is just fabulous, and the acting superb.  Lurch is fascinating, with his dead-pan visage, spontaneous appearances and harpsichord playing (backed by the genius Vic Mizzy). The same actor plays ""Thing""--and he says so much with his animated hand movements.  You can't overstate the fundamental brilliance of Thing.  Morticia is as glamourous as the living-dead (or whatever she is) can be.  She is gorgeous, and quite the botanist with her collection of highly cognizant plants. The Addams' life of leisure is quite enviable, as they always use their infinite time at home to fine-tune their various blue-blooded skills, and they prove themselves to be true Renassaince folk. Jackie Coogan's Uncle Fester is out of control. Illuminating light bulbs in his mouth, getting stretched on the rack, he's always up for a good time, and apparently oblivious to pain.  Aleister Crowley, I suspect, would consider this zany character his most cherished legacy. And ""Cousin It""?  Wow, that character almost scares me.  He, or It, I should say, is truly a psychedelic and sophisticated flourish which takes the show into a different realm of bizarre surreality.

The real show-stealer is Gomez, played by John Astin.  Good grief, the character he created here is just insanely funny.  He is dynamic, eccentric, suave, outrageous, gallant, compassionate, dapper, forgiving, generous...I could go on with descriptors for an hour.  I've told my wife I really need to become a lot more like Gomez.  He is truly one of the all-time great television characters. I read somewhere that Groucho Marx was used as a reference point for the character, and it makes sense.  John, if you by chance read this, my deepest thanks for all the happiness you have brought to the world.  It must be immensely satisfying knowing that you have brought so many smiles to this planet.

The scripts are extremely clever, with both an adult level and a kid's level.  I'm surprised how many of the issues the family deals with are relevant to today's world: turbulance in the stock market; issues with school officials (who disapprove of the kids bringing weapons and dynamite to campus, etc.), taxes, dysfunction in government, etc.

In the extras, there is an effort to remind everyone that this show was derived from the comic strip.  That is generous, but I personally think this this show transcends and betters the comic strip in a multitude of ways.  The debt of gratitiude should run to the show, not the other way around.

What has happened to our world?  Yeah, global warming, over-population, the economy...but also look at television as a micro-paradigm of societal decay.  I know you will say there have been good shows recently, and there have been (some).  But if you do a side-by-side comparison of, say, some good shows like  The Sopranos, Frazier, Seinfield, and Friends and you compare them with The Wild, Wild West, The Munsters, Addams Family, Batman, Mission Impossible, The Night Gallery, Benny Hill, Leave it to Beaver...one gets the strong impression that creativity is really in decline.  The sheer level of elaboration in the production values alone distinguishes the eras: the sets themselves were works of art.  Television used to go full-out, now it is so frequently about compromise and cost-cutting.  Are ""reality shows"" going to implant the wonderful visions into the minds of kids that these shows did?  Instead, I get a migraine from ""Survivor"" and the like--and even ""American Idol"" has a chaotic, campy aspect which certainly doesn't enrich the world much.

But I digress.  The Addams Family is one of life's really good things. For the ten times the price, you would be well rewarded by what you get here. The pictures look great, and the fun is non-stop.  Buy this for yourself and revive your own memories, or buy this for your kids or grand kids and create a whole new generation of memories.  I am convinced: 200 years from now people will be watching this show, laughing until their sides split.  This is television for the post-television age, televison for eternity.

2929201,5,B000V3JGIS,"One of the most genuinely crazy-funny TV shows of this Baby Boomer's childhood is The Addams Family. Sadly, it seems to have disappeared from television -- at least, I haven't seen it in ages.

What a coup to have this complete set of the entire series. The DVD is perfect in every way, except for one flaw that was part of the original -- a laugh track. I'm happy that this seems to have disappeared from the television shows of today. I think I'm culturally savvy enough to know where to insert my own guffaws and giggles.

What a great treasure to own!",1201478400,,555,4.378640776699029
2929202,4,B000V3JGIS,For $34.99 you can't beat that I love that show when I was about 6yr old,1201219200,,72,3.5625
2929203,5,B000V3JGIS,"Originally, I knew the Addams Family not from the television series, but from their first animated series.  Many know the Addams Family spawned from drawings and characters created by Charles Addams for the New Yorker.

The Addams Family appeared like your average, eccentric rich family.  Except for the fact, they lived in an old mansion containing trapdoors, a lab, torture chamber and dungeon.  Had pets like a live lion, vulture and African Strangler, and a disembodied hand as sort of a relation.

Gomez Addams was the cigar-smoking, fencing, always nimble head of the household, while Morticia tended to her garden, fed her plants, and made sure everything ran smoothly in the house.  Next was Lurch, their zombiesque butler who would appear out of nowhere whenever the noose gong was pulled.

He'd come in and claim, 'You rang?'  Then you had Uncle Fester, who mysteriously kept an electric charge through his body, had a penchant for explosives, and kept a vulture in the house.  Grandma-ma who loved casting spells, fortune telling, and cooking the occasional spider, snakes and bat-shaped cookies for her grandchildren, Wednesday and Puggsley Addams.

Unlike their film counterparts, Wednesday and Puggsley were actually nice kids with some odd habits of having pet spiders and octopi, and liking things like wild gorillas and such.  Wednesday even carried around her headless doll, Marie Antoinette.

Besides the standard brood, the Addamses' relations were not exactly normal either:  Grandma Frump (Morticia's mother, played by Margaret Hamilton - aka Wicked Witch of the West) who originally wanted Gomez to marry Morticia's 'flowery' twin sister, Ophelia (played by Carolyn Jones as well).  Then you had Cousin Itt, the dark-glasses, derby-wearing, living hair.

Now the strange thing was, overlooking their macabre and gruesome environment, the Addams Family was far from evil or sinister.  They simply viewed things differently than what the average person might view them.

For instance, in ""The Addams Family Goes to School,"" Wednesday comes home crying because in 'Grim's Fairly Tales,' she learns things like dragons, witches, and ogres are slain by 'horrible' knights, children, and warriors.  Naturally, Gomez and Morticia go to complain about their children being exposed to such 'violence.'  Reluctantly the school truant complies, stating he'll make certain 'violence will be abolished' in the school.

Besides the hilarity though, the Addams Family did demonstrate it was better accepting people for whom they are than to change them.  In ""The Addams Family Meets a Beatnik,""  the family rescue a beatnik who has just crashed his motorcycle on their property.

At first, ""Rocky"" reacts to the Addamses as most people would.  Rather than being adversed to Rocky's beatnik behaviour, they become fascinated with his speech and manor.  They even throw him a surprise birthday party as well.  Meanwhile Gomez and Morticia discover Rocky's true identity of being the heir to a business tycoon.  Except what they don't realize is, Rocky and his Dad don't see eye-to-eye on things.

It isn't until after the Addams brings them together, Rocky and his Dad learn they have to accept each other for who they are, not what they want them to be.

Overall, the timelessness about the Addams Family is they live carefree, and enjoy their way of life, accepting everyone and everything around them.  Even when most people have a hard time accepting them.

The collection is great for those who fondly remember Gomez and Morticia, and definitely wonderful for the next generation who might wonder why we loved shows about an odd family living in an old house.

Although still creepy and spooky, and altogether ooky, we still love the Addams Family.",1199577600,34,3760,5.215
2929204,3,B000V3JGIS,"Yes, the gentle social critique of The Addams Family is still relevant, and the cast - especially John Astin, Carolyn Jones and Jackie Coogan - is superb, but the shrill and insistent laugh track makes this show difficult for a contemporary audience to watch. Because the viewer is constantly being reminded that what they are watching is funny, the comedy becomes less real and consequently less funny. If The Addams Family had dispensed with its laugh track it would have been much funnier and acclaimed as a great social satire; instead, it's a tolerably amusing old tv show with boorish canned sniggering. The Complete Series doesn't add much to the mix, either. The sound and image is good quality, but there are few worthy extras on the discs: a handful of meandering, pointless commentaries about trivia usually unrelated to the episode in question and, especially, a really bad featurette of supporting players' careers which is ghastly in execution and insulting to the actors. This is easily the most disappointing dvd box set I've bought.",1197331200,9,1049,5.0344827586206895
