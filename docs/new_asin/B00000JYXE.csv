8609688,5,B00000JYXE,"Beyond Briefs is the second installment of the Males in Motion male stripper series from around 1985-1987 and very hard to find.

It's great to compare the influence of the 70's upon the mid 80's man, and leaves nothing to the imagination.

If anything, buy it for the cop, or any of the first four strippers, the others are kind of just fill, except for your host 'Marcus"", he was the cowboy stripper in the original males in motion series.

Highly recommend, it's very fun, and worth finding just to relive the era.",1272326400,,517,4.537634408602151
