However what I am not a fan of is reality TV. I only picked this one up because a lot of friends said it was not that much of a reality TV show, but funny.

However, after watching it, I can see what they where saying, but what it's left me feeling is that Terry Bolleah is an a*****.

The way he treats his daughter and telling her she needs to be thin and should only eat healthy to me was just wrong. And the way he tells his son he can't date a girl because he should be looking for more girls is fubar.

I can understand he is a protective parent, but there is a limit, like secretly stalking your daughter by a gps unit and calling her every time they go down a street that they did not inform Hogan of.... come on, let them live a little, teach them how to have safe sex if there going to do it, not tell them sex is a bad thing and they are not allowed to do it.

Plus, a lot of things seemed to be copying stuff I saw on the Osbourne's. And it makes me wonder if anything they show is legit, or if it's scripted. Seems strange you see maybe a dog or two in one episode, then the next there is 100 animals everywhere.... is it selective editing, or someone coming up with something that might be interesting for that episode?

From a few clips I saw on youtube, it seems like season 2 got funnier, I might check that one out later, but as for season 1, i have lost a lot of respect for Hogan if that is the way he really treats his kids.",1221177600,4,1555,3.9363057324840764
