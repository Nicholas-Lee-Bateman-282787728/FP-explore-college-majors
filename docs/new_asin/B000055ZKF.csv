1394475,1,B000055ZKF,"I just purchased WWF Unforgiven and I have to say that the whole event was a huge letdown. Coming off what I believe was one of the greatest Summerslams in history, I thought that Unforgiven would be just as entertaining. I was sadly mistaken.
1. WWF Tag Team Championship Elimination Match-Big Show & Spike Dudley vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Lance Storm & The Hurricane vs. Dudley Boyz: This match was OK, however it seemed a bit long for the first match on the card-***
2. Perry Saturn vs. Raven w/Terri-How in the world is this match after a tag team title match? This feud didn't even begin until a week before the PPV. I won't give out the endings to any of the matches, but this match was lame-*
3. WWF Intercontinental Championship-Edge vs. Christian-This match wasn't bad, but then again wasn't good either. This match had some high spots but nothing really to write home about. The ending was very tame-**1/2
4. WCW Tag Team Championship-Undertaker & Kane vs. Kronik-You don't get any bad than this. This is when the crowd started to die down and I can't say that I blame them. The wrestling in this match was HORRIBLE, and the bump-taking was mediocre. No wonder the WWF asked Kronik to be in a developmental league a day after the PPV-No stars
5. WCW Championship Handicap Match-Rock vs. Shane & Booker T.-Another ho hum Rock match. This match was pathetic. From what we've all seen Shane do from previous PPV's, we know that he is capable of being more productive than his performance at this event. He was almost non-existent this entire match. Basically, another Booker T vs. Rock match.-*1/2
6. WWF Hardcore Match-Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Jericho-This match started off slow, but got a little entertaining near the end. A nice effort from both superstars. Pretty good ending-***1/2
7. WCW United States Championship-Tajiri vs. Rhyno-As quick as this match was, this could possibly have been one of the best  matches on the card. Most definitely a sleeper match. Little hype before the PPV, but the confrontation between the two was very entertaining-***
8. WWF Championship Match-Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kurt Angle-This match was the culmination of all of the embarrassments and animosity that the two felt for one another over the weeks. Angle controlled a lot of the match, but then again, this PPV was in Pittsburgh. Decent match, the ending was quick and lame. Very controversial.-**1/2
All in all, this PPV was by far the worst of 2001. If you want to watch horrible bump-taking and crappy endings, than you will really enjoy this PPV. Or if you just want to purchase it to see one particular match. I would suggest renting it. Otherwise, my advice would be to stay away from this PPV.",1008288000,2,2697,4.738297872340426
1394476,5,B000055ZKF,"Wow! this PPV has it all!! A new WWF Champ, A great Hardcore Match, an exciting Tag Team Turmoil Match, and a Great one on one match between brothers. I'll discuss the best matches only, 1st and foremost the WWF Championship match - New WWF Champ Crowned For the 2nd time!!! , WWF Hardcore match - Great match between Rvd and Y2J (unforgettable bumps!!)the 2nd best match of the evening, WWF tag team match - A very entertaining one (guaranteed!), WWF Intercontinental Match - Good back and forth match between edge and christian (not a very happy ending though, they could have thought of something better). Rock's match between Shane Mcmahon and Booker T is Ok nothing special (I am not a rock fan),Taker and Kane vs. Kronic is another ok match between 4 big men (a very slow match),Raven Vs Perry saturn (DUh!),Tajiri vs. Rhyno (watchable match). overall this pay per view is a classic! because of the Austin/Angle Rematch and Rvd/Y2J match.

1394477,2,B000055ZKF,"The WWF DVD in and of itself was pretty poor, it had absolutely no extras and did not arrive with a little pamphlet or booklet insidet the cover.  The Event was Alright but a lot of mistakes made by the wrestlers.
WWF TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:  (Fair)
this match was ok, I expected more from the Big Show.  The match was a decent starter and was entertaining.
WCW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:  (Poor)
I really expected this to be a good match, it was part of the reason I was looking forward to this event.  You would think Kronik and the Bros. of Destruction would put on a show for the fans, but these guys sent fans to the concession stands and bathroom breaks.  Kronik's execution of 80% of the moves in the match was horrbily done and Undertaker and Kane were off key too.  This was a match that could be broadcast on Smackdown or RAW not meant for a PPV.
Saturn vs. Raven (Poor)
Let's see these too faught at WCW Fall Brawl '98, WCW Road Wild '98, and WCW Bash at the Beach '98.  This match wasn't worth putting on the card.  Hell, the whole card was Title matchs they might as well put a Cruiserweight title match or Light heavyweight title match to fill in this load of crap.
WWF INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE MATCH:  (Good)
I liked the idea of this two going at it for a title belt.  I really like Christian's new gimmick and the wrestling style of these guys are very similiar which made the match even more interesting.  This one is worth being put on a PPV card.
WCW US CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:  (fair)
This was a ok match, I've always been fond of the US Title, a bit too short wouldn't you say?  Both Rhyno and Tajiri put on a decent show.
WCW CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:  (Good)
Well this match was pretty good, I think they should have just taken Shane out of the match and made it a singles competition.
Shane in the ring is a joke, the only time he actually meant something in the ring was at King of the Ring.  The Rock and Booker T have good ring chemistry together and it was overall a good match.
WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH:  (Fair)
This rematch from Summerslam did not live up to the original Summerslam Match.  Neither one of these guys got to hit their signature finishers.  Angle had a really good stunner on Austin though, but Austin's ""angle slam"" was about as bad as the Raven vs. Saturn match.  this match had a controversial ending, Angle only was champ for 2 weeks, big Whoop.  Oh yeah and this was a much shorter match than it's Summerslam Original.
OK so if you want to get Unforgiven sooo bad, get the VHS version, the DVD version has nothing to offer what-so-ever.  This event was decent, don't rush to buy it though.  summerslam was a lot better.  Peace out.",1007942400,,2674,4.355555555555555
1394478,5,B000055ZKF,Kurt Angle finally did it. He won the WWF title from Stone Cold Steve Austin in another classic match. The Rock and Booker T. disappoint in the handicap match for the wcw title. Another awesome match is between Y2J and Rob Van Dam. Unforgiven is definately worth buying for some kick a$$ wrestling.,1007164800,,298,4.6415094339622645
1394479,2,B000055ZKF,"WWF Unforgiven 2001 was a PPV that was basically a rehash of the prior month's SummerSlam event.  Here is a match by match review.
1.) WWF TAG TEAM TITLES:  Dudley Boyz (c) vs. Hardy Boyz vs. The Hurricane & Lance Storm vs. Big Show & Spike Dudley.  A good opener to get the crowd going.  ***.
2.) Perry Saturn vs. Raven.  A disapointing match that dragged on and on and on.  Should have been on HeAT.  1/4*.
3.) WWF INTERCONTINENTAL TITLE:  Edge (c) vs. Christian.  Not the classic we had been waiting for from these two.  A decent match, with a dull finish.  **1/2.
4.) WCW TAG TEAM TITLES:  Undertaker & Kane (c) vs. Kroni>|.  Not worth the words to describe it.  DUD.
5.) WWF HARDCORE TITLE:  Rob Van Dam (c) vs. Chris Jericho.  Definitely the show stealer, but probably not a Match-of-the-Year Candidate.  ****.
6.) WCW TITLE HANDICAP MATCH:  The Rock (c) vs. Booker T & Shane McMahon.  It's academic who wins this one, and Shane McMahon's involvement was totally useless.  *1/2.
7.) WCW U.S. TITLE MATCH:  Tajiri (c) vs. Rhyno.  Decent, but short.  *.
8.) WWF TITLE MATCH:  ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin (c) vs. Kurt Angle.  Their worst match together, although still good.  ***.
----------------------------------------------
The matches themselves are decent enough to give this PPV a thumbs in the middle, but it's nothing special.  But the DVD itself is terrible.  There are ZERO extras.  Nothing from Sunday Night Heat, no special interviews, or anything else.  WWF DVD's usually tend to have at least a few good extras.  This one wasn't one of them.
Probably one to pass up unless you're a huge Kurt Angle fan.",1005696000,6,1618,4.7328519855595665
1394480,4,B000055ZKF,"Unforgiven 2001 was an extremely physical and aggressive event, probably one of the most interesting of the year, at the height of the WWF/WCW/ECW invasion angle. I'll do my best to rate the matches accordingly, seeing how hardly any of them were particularly terrible.
1. WWF Tag Team Title Match:
The Hurricane & Lance Storm vs. Big Show & Spike Dudley
vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz
Honestly, great tag team action, but the 500 pound Big Show should've had that match in the bag. Oh well, maybe next time.
2. Perry Saturn vs. Raven
Perhaps this should have been a match on Sunday Night HeAt, or maybe even Smackdown. Good high risk offense from Saturn, who begins the trend of the night with a cut under the eye.
3. WWF Intercontinental Title:
Christian vs. Edge
It's about time these two began a rivalry. Good, solid technically sound wrestling match. Superb performances, and a nice cut under Edge's eye.
4. WCW Tag Team Title:
KroniK w/Steven Richards vs. The Undertaker & Kane
Okay, I know I said no matches were particularly terrible, but this one really sucked. One of the members of Kronik gets a nice slash under the eye. Only reason to even give this one the time of day is probably for Undertaker or Kane.
5. WWF Hardcore Title:
Chris Jericho vs. Rob Van Dam
How ironic, I should have figured these two would meet up eventually. Good tandom Hardcore offense, and an amazing chair shot by Jericho, catching RVD between the ropes. Oh yeah, Jericho gets cut under the eye.
6. WCW Heavyweight Title - Handicap Match:
Booker T. & Shane McMahon vs. The Rock
As if The Rock would really lose to either Shane or Booker T.? It's just not going to happen as long as the fans love him. Actually, he's getting kind of tired and irritating.
7. WCW United States Title:
Rhyno vs. Tajiri w/Torrie Wilson
Pretty much a filler match. We see Rhyno gore Tajiri. We see Tajiri deliver some swift kicks to Rhyno, and we see up Torrie's dress. Decent contest.
8. WWF Heavyweight Title:
Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
The rematch from Summerslam is very intense. Austin gets a clean wound under the eye, and Angle forces him to tap under controversial cirumstances. Good match.
Overall, it's worth the money. Great ppv at the climax of the Alliance storyline.",1005264000,,2257,4.645

1394483,3,B000055ZKF,This years unforgiven was neither a great noor horrible PPV.  It was certainly better than the previous two unforgivens thats for sure.  It started off with the four team elimination match.  This was a solid match 7 out of 10.  A lot of high spots some comedy and some good intensity.  Next was Raven vs. Saturn.  4 out of 10 stars.  Not a bad match but really had no history and there just wasn't a whole lot of story behind it.  Next Edge vs. Christian.  8 out of 10. Best match so far.  They told a good story and made you believe there was a lot of hatred between the two.  Quite an intense match.  Next was Kane and Taker vs Kronik.  5.5 out of 10.  A lot of missed or weak spots and Brian Adams doesnt sell moves at all.  Nothing special.  Next was RVD vs Jericho. 8.5 out of 10.  Started off a little slow but picked up pretty quickly.  Some great moves and plenty of action.  Then it was Rock vs. Bocker T and Shane.  9 out of 10 best match of the night.  Really kept you guessing.  Shane didn't do anything too dramatic like he has done at other PPV's but still the match had plenty of intensity and kept you guessing.  Then it was Rhyno vs Tajiri.  7.5 out of 10.  Good match but it was two short and too onesided.  Finally Austin vs. Angle.  8 out of 10.  Good match but not as dramatic as their summerslam one and was a little long and Angle was controling two much of the match.  All in all a good but not great PPV.,1001289600,,1429,4.0577617328519855
1394488,4,B000055ZKF,"I have been a wrestling fan since 1996 and have watched all kinds of wrestling. I have a wrestling DVD/VHS collection spanning over 50 all together. This is the most complete and accurate review of this DVD you will find. I hope you find this review helpful; remember to vote helpful or not helpful. (Note-Each DVD I review has a ""Match of the DVD"" award somewhere in it.)

WWE Unforgiven 2001
Oddly enough, the first time I watched this I hated it. After watching it again, I learn that this is a very solid PPV. The problem with this event is that it really is not memorable. Most of the matches are only to advance storylines with no title change. There are no extras on this DVD.

4-Team Elimination Match
WWF Tag Team Championships
Dudley Boyz(c) VS Hardy Boyz VS Hurricane Helms & Lance Storm VS Big Show & Spike Dudley
This was a nice opener. Two men were in the ring at the time and you could tag anyone. There are some fun high-flying moments. There are also some nice comedy moments, including Helms trying to Chokeslam Big Show. The ending is weird considering the positioning of Jeff Hardy.
RATING- 8/10

Perry Saturn VS Raven w/ Terri
This is the only non-title match on the entire card. Raven destroyed Saturn's mascot, which was a mop named Moppy. Yeah, it is a horrible storyline. Raven is also wearing weird attire, which features a pair of boxers under his skirt. Saturn hits some good moves. The crowd is dead and the match is short.
RATING- 3/10

Intercontinental Championship
Edge(c) VS Christian
Christian turned on his own brother and is now after his gold. This is a strong match. They battle up the ramp at first and Edge brings the fight to Christian. Christian takes a sick shot to the staging. This was a strong wrestling contest with a unique finish.
RATING- 8/10

WCW Tag Team Championships
Undertaker & Kane(c) VS Kronik
This was actually the reason I bought this DVD. I wanted to see Kronik again. It was a mistake on my part. Kronik has terrible offense, and they sell moves like crap. Undertaker and Kane try to pull something good out of this one, but they just cannot.
RATING- 3/10

WWF Hardcore Championship
Rob Van Dam(c) VS Chris Jericho
RVD and Jericho never mixed to me. They always end up messing up a lot in the matches they have. This is evident in the opening minutes of this match. Still, this match eventually worked itself out and turned into a awesome match. There are not many weapons used, but this is a welcome change. Most action takes place in the ring.
RATING- 8.5/10

Handicap Match
WCW Championship
The Rock(c) VS Booker T & Shane McMahon
Not only is it a handicap match, but bias WCW referee Nick Patrick is officiating this contest. The Rock is not getting any slack in this match. Booker and Shane control this match with cheap tactics. Shane hits a few cool moves, including a diving closeline from the crowd barrier. There is interference from Test near the end of the match. This was a fun match.
RATING- 8/10

WCW U.S. Championship
Tajiri(c) w/ Torrie Wilson VS Rhyno
This was a good match at this place in the card. Tajiri has injured ribs, which makes him a target for the Gore. Rhyno focuses on the ribs of the Tajiri. This is a short, but fun, match.
RATING- 7/10

WWF Championship (Match of the DVD)
Stone Cold Steve Austin(c) VS Kurt Angle
This was a pure brawl. Austin screwed Kurt out of the title at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Summerslam-2001/dp/B00005Q4ER/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Summerslam 2001</a>. Angle is now seeking revenge. This match is taking place in Kurt's hometown of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. The crowd is electric for most of the match. Both men are focusing on the neck of the other. This is smart considering both of their previous broken necks. The match ends a bit suddenly.

1394489,5,B000055ZKF,This was an awesome product.  It was made when they were still part of the WWF.  A great addition to any wrestling collection.,1180828800,,126,4.434782608695652
1394490,2,B000055ZKF,"This PPV was about one thing...can the hometown boy Kurt Angle come on & gain the WWF Title that he got screwed out of at SummerSlam.

WWF Tag Team Champions Dudley Boyz vs. Lance Storm/Hurricane vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Big Show/Spike Dudley - This match was a good opener with some nice spots at times but they were having these 3/4 way matches weekly during the Invasion storyline so this isn't special but still a nice opener.  Look out for Lance Storm recieving a powerful chokeslam by Big Show...that look like it hurt.

Perry Saturn vs. Raven - This was the conclusion of the ""moppy"" storyline.  This match was really just ""there"" & the crowd was heavily quiet too.  Nothing special here.

Intercontinental Champion Edge vs. Christian - After months of teasing, they finally pulled the trigger here on this fued & resulted in a solid matchup here between two wrestlers who knew each other so well eventhough they would go on to top this performance later on in their feud.

WCW Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Kane vs. Kronik - This match was bad because both teams were almost exactly alike...and not in a good way.  In this case, it was heavily noticeable on Kronik that they were no selling & timing was off at various spots.  It's no wonder why you never saw Kronik in WWF again.

Hardcore Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Jericho - It's performances like this that made RVD the most popular face in the Alliance...when he's suppost to be a heel.  RVD's hardcore matches weren't the sterotypical performances in that they just hit each other with weapons non-stop.  They went ahead & delivered a great wrestling match with an occassional weapon (in this case a ladder) used to make a move more impactful.  Great performance here & was tons better than their that was used on RVD's DVD from King Of The Ring '02.

WCW Champion The Rock vs. Booker T & Shane McMahon - This was just one of those ""put a storyline over"" matches as it was heavily biased & deck stacked against The Rock as the WCW referee Nick Patrick all of a sudden would ""go blind"" whenever Shane or Booker broke the rules before the WWF referee interfeared to make everything even for the Rock to overcome.  It's watchable & entertaining at times but that's about it here.

WCW U.S. Champion Tajiri vs. Rhino - Just a short filler squash for Rhino to win the U.S. title.  Nothing more to say here.

WWF Champion Stone Cold vs. Kurt Angle - Honestly, this match didn't even come close to their SummerSlam classic or wasn't as good as their other ""lost classic"" from RAW earlier in the year but it was still a solid performance here.  The storytelling was there as Austin kept working on Angle's neck.  Overall, the match did what it's suppost to do & had Kurt Angle overcome the odds & win the WWF Title in his hometown with a hero's celebration afterwards.

In the end, there were only 1 match worth going out of your way to see which was RVD vs. Jericho while the rest were average & watchable to just short & bad.  Overall unless your a huge Kurt Angle fan & just have to see him win the title , this is one I would either find really cheap or pass on because you aren't missing anything special if you miss it.",1179446400,,3181,4.467128027681661
1394491,3,B000055ZKF,"I have to say that this PPV was quite disappointing (and the DVD has no bonus features---it's not the first WWF DVD, so wth?) though it wasn't an awful event that shouldn't be watched under any circumstances.

WWF Tag Team Championship

The Hardy Boyz vs The Dudley Boyz(C) vs Hurricane Helms and Lance Storm vs The Big Show and Spike Dudley

This was the absolute best match of the night!  There was plenty of action and athletics from everyone here, and the climax of the match was definitely seeing most all of the superstars battling on the outside as the Hardys jump off the top rope and crash into them all, and then The Big Show picks up Little Spike Dudley and tosses him on top of them all!  Should have been a bit longer, and the ending was somewhat disappointing compared with the earlier bits of the bout  (9/10)

Perry Saturn vs Raven

I have no idea what we were supposed to expect here.  Both of these men are veterans of ECW, and Saturn was a stellar athlete in ECW as one half of The Eliminators (where he was Saturn and his partner was Kronos (get it?)), but here the action is typical of a modern-day watered down WWE match between two brawlers without much gimmick or skill.  Both these men HAVE skill, but this match showed very little of it.  (2/10)

WWF Intercontinental Championship

Christian vs Edge(C)

The whole Christian getting jealous of Edge and breaking up the tag-team was one of the worst decisions I can imagine being made, but in the end it benefitted them both, as Edge went on to be a main eventer, and Christian left for TNA where he's now a main eventer there too.  These two together were a good tag team, and here it looks like two halves fighting each other.  Definitely a good one.  (7/10)

WCW Tag Team Championship

Kronik vs Undertaker(C) and Kane(C)

This is one of those matches that is too funny to be true.  I'm not that much of an expert that I can decipher bad wrestling if it isn't overt, but after reading about how badly Kronik bungled this one and finally seeing it for myself, I can truly laugh at how stiff and dull the duo were in comparison to Undertaker and Kane, who then had to work with these two idiots in trying to pull off something resembling a wrestling match.  Highlight of the match was one of the Kronik guys totally bungling his sell of Undertaker's knee lifts by lifting his head too early and missing Undertaker's knee by a good foot or foot and a half.  (1/10)

WWF Hardcore Championship

Chris Jericho vs Rob Van Dam(C)

After the amazing match with Jeff Hardy at Invasion, this one seemed a bit disappointing in comparison.  But on its own, this was a great match which didn't have to rely on excessive use of weapons to get the crowd riled up.  I also loved to see two faces (despite the Alliance being the heel organization) with their own pieces of the crowd out-chanting each other for dominance.  Y2J chants mixed with RVD chants frequently as these two bouted it out in true Face vs Heel fashion, but none could tell who was the face and who was the heel.  The whole Stephanie McMahon interference was predictable, and sort of ruined the ending for me.  (7/10)

WCW Championship Match

Shane McMahon and Booker T vs The Rock(C)

The Rock is truly an electrifying athlete, totally deserving of the shrieking cries his fans give him (unlike John Cena nowadays), and this match shows that his skill doesn't diminish over time or storylines.  The real drama story of this match was the WCW-biased referee who blatantly ignored Shane hitting The Rock with the championship belt, and even tossed The Rock back in the ring to avoid being counted out.  This eventually prompted a WWF referee to attack the WCW referee and Earl Hebner to rush in and count for The Rock.  Overall, not a spectacular match, but definitely of better caliber than most.  (6/10)

WCW US Championship

Rhyno vs Tajiri(C)

Yoshihiro Tajiri (his ECW name) was an athlete the likes of Super Crazy, Little Guido, perhaps even Rey Mysterio and Rob Van Dam.  This Tajiri is a shell of his former self, and it really shows.  He hardly does much good, while Rhyno is only good for his finisher, Gore, and for some heavier moves.  Short, thankfully, as it wasn't much more than a glorified squash match for Rhyno  (3/10)

WWF Championship

Kurt Angle vs Stone Cold Steve Austin(C)

I might get a lot of heat for saying this, but it's truly what I believe---this match was ordinary.  There wasn't much going for it despite the hype, and Angle's sudden turn from dopey jackass to sharp, hard-Face American hero was a sudden one I must have missed at some point between Invasion and Unforgiven.  Angle is a spellbinding athlete, and totally deserves being a face among faces, and I agree he was brutally mistreated and misused by the WWF here (being the idiot milk-drinking dope in early 2001) and WWE (up until his leaving for TNA), and his athleticism here contrasts sharply with Austin's roughneck style.  Still, they manage to pull off a dignified main event worthy of a TV event or a minor pay per view.  Still something of a disappointment to me  (7/10)

In total this pay per view wasn't a very good one.  The lack of any special features also brought this down an entire half star, while some of the promos and things they did in between matches seemed kind of pointless or time-wasting (the whole interviewing of Kurt Angle's family was embarrassing, especially trying to watch grandma go along with kayfabe).

Not one of WWF's best in 2001",1175904000,,5491,4.575384615384616
1394492,4,B000055ZKF,"It's official - 2001 is simply one of the best years in WWF/WWE history, and UNFORGIVEN is another reason as to why.  This is a PPV card that is a lot stronger than it looks!

1) Elimination Match - WWF Tag Team Championships
The Hardy Boyz v. The Hurricane (WWF European champion) & Lance Storm
v. Big Show & Spike Dudley v. The Dudley Boyz (WWF Tag Team champions)
---This was an exciting Elimination contest with neat spots, good wrestling, and a wild Pennsylvania crowd.  The Dudleyz and The Hardyz always put on good matches, and the other two teams were in fine form.  A perfect example of how the ""Invasion"" angle brought new talent and energy to the WWF.
""8.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

2) Raven v. Perry Saturn
---The only non-title match on the card featured Saturn looking for ""Moppy"", with Raven as the culprit.  Confused?  Don't worry, you'll understand from the PPV.  The crowd hated this match, but I think Saturn and Raven worked really hard considering this storyline had no respect from anybody (I thought it was pretty funny).  Much better than the trainwreck everyone makes it out to be.
""5.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

3) WWF Intercontinental Championship
Christian v. Edge (champion)
---In their first-ever one-on-one bout (to my knowledge), both men were still WWF wrestlers at the time, which was unusual for the ""Invasion"" PPVs.  This was yet another solid contest with plenty of near-falls and unique exchanges.  Also noteworthy is that both Christian and Edge were as good in singles competition as they were tag team wrestlers.  One of the few tag team breakups that helped both superstars.  The Ladder Match that took place a month later is the one everybody remembers (rightfully so), but this is an incredible match worth checking out.
""8.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

4) WCW Tag Team Championships
Kronik v. The Undertaker & Kane (champions)
---Now for the real stinker: Bryan Adams and Bryan Clark made their first and last WWF match together as they challenged the WCW Tag Team champs (who were actually WWF talent).  Taker and Kane worked so hard to make Adams and Clark look good, but Kronik no-sold just about everything thrown at them.  The match was kept to a nice pace, but this match was so badly performed that you'll just stare in disbelief.  I still recommend the match because it's so unbelievably terrible that it's good for a laugh.
""2.0 / 10"" (but still worth seeing for some gut-busting laughs!)

5) WWF Hardcore Championship
Chris Jericho v. Rob Van Dam (champion)
---Now for some genuinely good news: this is my personal favorite Match from 2001!  What a fantastic match!  Mat wrestling skirmishes, ladders, chairs, and plenty of high-spots.  One of the best matches that Y2J and RVD have put on in their careers!  If you've seen RVD's ONE OF A KIND 2-disc set, than you've witnessed three incredible WWE matches.  Well guess what?  I still think this one is better than all of them.  I can't wait to pop in my DVD again, just to see this!
""9.5 / 10""

6) 2-on-1 Handicap Match - WCW Championship
Shane McMahon (WCW Owner) & Booker T v. The Rock (champion)
---I didn't expect much out of this one, but it was a much better Handicap Match than I expected.  What happened in this match was fairly 'believeable' - Shane and Booker kept an advantage, but The Rock kept the fight going.  Plus, there was a nice tease with Shane possibly walking out with the belt instead of the crazed Booker T.  With some Alliance and WWF interference thrown in, this was a pleasant surprise.  It still holds up after a couple viewings.  If you liked the SUMMERSLAM main event between Booker & Rock, then I think you'll enjoy this just as much.
""7.0 / 10""

7) WCW United States Championship
Rhyno v. Tajiri (champion)
---Why do so many WWF superstars have WCW belts, and vice versa?  Never mind.  This match was very good, but way too short.  I don't remember how this one got booked, and the PPV doesn't do a good job of reminding me.  If given even as much as 5 more minutes, this random contest would've become even better.
""6.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

8) WWF Championship
Kurt Angle v. 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin (champion)
---In the main event, hometown hero Kurt Angle got another crack at Austin's WWF Championship, since Angle got screwed out of the title at SUMMERSLAM 2001.  Once again, they both put on a solid match.  Good psychology, plus a nice touch to have Angle's family at ringside (though they should never do interviews again).  In my opinion, the other Angle-Austin encounters from 2001 were much better than this one.  Angle's never-say-due performance from SUMMERSLAM was breathtaking, but this time, it felt more obligatory.  But I'm nitpicking -- Angle and Austin didn't disappoint me.  Whether you love it or just like it, this main event will be worth your time and money.
""7.0 / 10""

Overall, a pleasantly good show. However, Austin/Angle was a disappointment from where I sit, they can have a better match than that and they did (SummerSlam) and will (Vengeance).

Christian and Edge wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and the Raven and Saturn match was actually a suprisingly great outing, too bad half the fans had already hit the stands, by the time the match got started.  But anyway everything was well timed and the as close to perfect as I've seen in a while.  The Tajiri Match was a slaughter, even though Tajiri did get some got heat on Rhino, he's still the manbeast and gored the little guy into oblivion.  Stone Cold and Angle was completely force fed and wasn't too bad, but is it me or is Austin trimming down his arsenal of moves to include only punches stunners and restholds?  The 4 way tag was very entertaining, you really gotta like Huricain Helms.  BY FAR the best match of the night was of course Rob Van Dam vs Jericho.  I can't remember the last time I've seen a bad RVD match, anyway this was when the behind the curtain politics were hammering RVD for being to reckless and dangerous on other wrestlers, Van Dam doesn't really redeme himself in this match in fact this is complete case in point.  Jericho gets the living crap beat out of him willingly, Van first kicks his shoulder and neck before the rolling thunder and Jericho is pretty vocal about it.  Next Jericho misses the lionsault and gets a ""harlem side kick"" so hard it welts up the side of his face, and RVD has to stall for a few.  Then Jericho blunders on his own and jumps out of the ring and to the guardrail.  This really isn't Jerichos night.

WWF Tag-Team belts: Dudley Boyz(Bubba-Ray/D-Von) vs. the Hurricane/Lance Storm vs. Hardy Boyz(Matt/Jeff) vs. Big Show/Spike Dudley:
Good opening bout with some decent bumps. Thankfully, Big Show isn't involved enough to hurt it. Rating:7
Perry Saturn vs. Raven with Terri:
OK match with some decent mat wrestling. Unfortunately, this is a match best saved for ""Raw"". Rating:6
Intercontinental belt: Edge vs. Christian:
Great match! Two talented dogs give it their all here in a contest with a good mixture of mat wrestling and brawling. Rating:8
WCW Tag-Team belts: the Undertaker/Kane vs. Kronik(Bryan Adams/Bryan Clark):
Oh, man, this match is terrible. All four men(especially Adams and Kane)bumble around, punching, kicking and selling pitifully.
Clark turns in the best performance in this match(sorry, Undertaker fans), and still manages to botch most of his moves. rating:2
WWF Hardcore belt: Rob Van Dam vs. Chris Jericho:
Match of the year candidate that saw probably got the biggest pops of the night, and rightfully so. A must-see for any serious wrestling fan. Match of the night all the way. Rating:10
WCW belt: the Rock vs. Booker T and Shane Mcmahon:
Decent enough two-on-one match, but the sloppy finish that is WCW
referee Nick Patrick and WWF referee Earl Hebner fighting kinda kills it. Rating:4
U.S. Belt: Tajiri vs. Rhyno:
Adequate, but too short. Rating:5

UNFORGIVEN 2001

Now I know that a lot of fans did not really enjoy the Alliance angle but I have to admit right now I loved it. Now of course it could have been SO much better but looking back the in ring product was great. I can say that because going back to that year the matches were excellent and there were some great moments.

1.[TAG TITLE 4 WAY MATCH]THE HARDY BOYZ VS LANCE STORM 7 THE HURRICANE VS THE BIG SHOW & SPIKE DUDLEY VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ-excellent opening match and it just makes miss these days when tag matches meant something. There is all kinds of action before the first team is even eliminated, that of course being Lance Storm and Hurricane. It was not to long after when Show and Spike had to go, that left rivals Dudley's and Hardy's. These two teams go at it like all know they are able to putting on a great show. In the end though The Dudley's keep the belts even after Jeff breaks up a close two count, that is one for the Alliance.

2. RAVEN VS PERRY SATURN-the second match of the evening was the only non title match on the card. This one came about because Raven killed off moppy, Saturn's mop, yes you read that write. Any way this may not be the best match on the card but it is not horrible. Still given the history of the two I can tell you now they have had better matches against each other. In the end Perry gets that revenge in a decent match. WWF gets that win back.

3.[I-C TITLE]EDGE VS CHRISTIAN-one of my favorite feuds from this time period with a great storyline in my opinion. These two were one of the greatest tag teams of all time only to be broken up by Christian's jealousy. He was jealous of Edge winning the King of the Ring that year and also winning the I-C title. So this match was a WWF vs. WWF match with the former brothers going at it. This is a great match and showed that both of these guys were great even as singles competitors. Several near falls occur in this match with both controlling at one point. But a low blow seals Edge's fate and Christian gets the win and the I-C championship.

4.[WCW TAG TITLE]UNDERTAKER & KANE VS KRONIK-I was always a fan of Kronik in their WCW days so when they debuted in the WWF I was all kinds of excited. Of course their run did not last long and their matches here were not as great but still. Any way they came into the WWF as Alliance members and cost Taker and Kane the WWF titles against The Dudley Boyz. So the match was set here as they went after the WCW tag titles. Now this was not the match that it could have been, if only they would have preformed like they did in WCW. Still for a big man match it was good with all four guys hitting power moves. Taker and Kane keep the belts in a decent match. This was also the last match Kronik had in the WWF, too bad because I wanted a Kronik vs. APA feud. Mainly because APA worked for hire as did Kronik in WCW, ""breaking necks and cashing checks"". Of course I would have seen APA coming out on top in that one. This puts the WWF up by one.

5.[HARDCORE TITLE]RVD VS CHRIS JERICHO-one of the best matches of the night and very possibly the best on the card. Two of the all time greats in my opinion showed why they were and will always be main event level athletes. The match starts off with guys trying to outdo each other hold for hold and move for move. Eventually they hit spot after spot and the hardcore element comes into play with various weapons. After a great match The Billion Dollar Princess makes her way down to the ring costing Y2J the match. RVD ties it up for the Alliance.

6.[WCW TITLE]THE ROCK VS BOOKER T & SHANE MCMAHON-this match came about because Booker had lost to Rock at Summerslam. So Shane-O-Mac came up with this handicap match thinking for sure the WCW title would ""come home"". I have to say that this was such an entertaining match from start to finish. Rock and Booker put in a great match and Shane of course was his usual high flying entertaining self I really loved the ref's going at it as did the fans. The Rock kept the title after delivering a really fun match. WWF takes the lead once more.

7.[WCW U.S. TITLE]RHYNO VS TAJIRI-two guys I have always enjoyed watching would be going at it right here. Rhyno controls most of the match unleashing his power against the smaller Tajiri. Things turn around for a moment only when Tajiri lands his kick stopping a gore from being delivered onto Torri. Still Rhyno comes out on top and takes the U.S. title and ties it up for the night.

8.[WWF TITLE]STEVE AUSTIN VS KURT ANGLE-after Austin found a way out in their match at Summerslam this one had to happen. The bridge incident and milk truck scene are still classic. Both lead to Austin and Angle doing it one more time here at Angle's hometown. Like before they both put on a great match with both getting near falls. The crowd was so into this one of course and it added to the atmosphere and feel of the match. Angle is intense in this match not wanting to lose in front of his home crowd and Austin is as desperate as ever. They tell the story wonderfully with both characters playing their roles to a T. the match is great with Angle of course coming out on top with the title.

This was a fun PPV but not the best from that year, but still it was a good one. I really wish there would have been some special features here. I would have loved moments from the next night on Raw or something. Still it was good night of wrestling and put over some storylines from that time.",1336953600,,5480,4.230401529636711
7931371,5,B000055ZKF,"Hardy Boyz VS Hurricane & Lance Storm VS Big Show & Spike Dudley VS The Dudley Boyz: A very good opener with Dudley Boyz retaining the title in the end despite a good effort from Hardy Boyz

Raven VS Saturn: An excellent match between two very underrated wrestlers. I don't care if people hated this match, I thought it was very good. Saturn's gimmick at this time was really stupid and Terri was friggin smoking hot.

Christian VS Edge: A good match between the former tag team partners. The ending was awesome as Christian wins the intercontinental belt.

Kronik VS Undertaker and Kane: In there only WWE match Kronik faces The Brothers of Destruction. Kronik had a succesful tag team run during the dying days of WCW and won a few tag titles along the way. Apparently they got fired because of this match. It's not really bad but it's far too long and could have been cut down.

RVD VS Chris Jericho: Alot of people enjoyed this match and it was good but it wasn't an all time classic. Stephaine McMahon interferes and helps RVD retain the hardcore title.

Booker T and Shane O' Mac VS The Rock: A very entertaining match but it did feel like alot of Rock's matches that i've seen before. The ending was chaotic, fast paced, and very well done.

Rhino VS Tajiri: A good, short match with Rhino winning in the end via gore and wins the US title.

Kurt Angle VS Steve Austin: This was in Angle's hometown, which in wrestling terms means 9 times out of 10 that the hometown hero will win in the end. A nice video package airs before the match and Angle's family was interviewed earlier in the night. While it's not Austin or Angle's greatest match, they still put on a very good show and the ending was vintage Angle.

Overall, this was a must own/watch PPV. I miss the Invasion angle even though it was poorly handled by the WWE. There wasn't a bad match on this entire card.",1259539200,,1876,4.433139534883721
7931372,3,B000055ZKF,"Unforgiven carried some feuds over from the Summerslam event such as the Rock/Booker T and the Austin/Angle feuds. And thats mostly what this whole event did. To include filler matches that weren't even announce until the night before.

Four Team Elimination Match for the WWF Tag Team Titles
Dudleyz vs. Big Show & Spike vs. Hardyz vs. Lance Storm & Hurricane Helms
A solid opener. It certainly got the crowd going. Some good spots in this one such as the Hardys and Spike going to the air. But the Hardys and Dudleys are the ones who kept this one going. 4/5

Perry Saturn vs. Raven
This match had a stupid storyline going in (Saturn losing ""Moppy""). Both are good wrestlers but this was the first filler match and it didn't deliver. Both could have done much better. 2.5/5

Intercontinental Title
Christian vs. Edge
You will soon forget about this match after you see their classic Ladder match a month later at No Mercy. This match just played as a simple brother vs. brother match. The same kind of deal we saw from Bret and Owen. Decent match but doesn't compare to their epic a month later. 3.5/5

WCW Tag Team Titles
Undertaker & Kane vs. Kronik
This match was way off. Kane was still injured from the cage match at Summerslam. Taker and Kane tried to carry Kronik but it just didn't work out. Another decent match right here. 3/5

Hardcore Title
RVD vs. Chris Jericho
Definitely one of the best matches of the night. RVD and Jericho meshes very well with each other. A couple of good spots and weapon use. You will even see reminiscence of the Jericho/Benoit Ladder match here like when Jericho applies the Walls of Jericho to RVD on the ladder and also smashing RVD with a steel chair when RVD dives through the ropes. Great match and one of the high notes of the night. 4.5/5

Handicap Match for the WCW Heavyweight Title
The Rock vs. Booker T & Shane McMahon
I felt this match didn't equal the same type of match we saw from Booker and Rock from Summerslam. Some entertaining spots but I think the interfernce from the refs fully took away from the match. Good match and it still had that title match feel to it. 4/5

WCW United States Title
Rhyno vs. Tajiri
Tajiri was suffering the effects of the Gore from Rhyno from the past RAW. The match didn't give much and nothing special to note here. But I think the match was more about putting over Tajiri and Torrie as a couple. A little disappointed with this match though. Especially with what these two talented wrestlers are capable of. 2.5/5

WWF Title
Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
Much different match then what we saw from Summerslam. Angle was more of the aggressor and really taking it to Austin. Austin was really selling the beating he was getting from Angle here. Austin was morely on the defensive side then anything else. A nasty brawl happens on the outside with very little wrestling happening inside the ring. But with this PPV coming off the effects of 9/11 just 2 weeks before and the PPV being held in Kurt's hometown of Pittsburg, it was only right for Angle to win the title. But after losing the title 3 weeks before next month's No Mercy PPV, Kurt wasn't due for a strong title run just yet. A good match but don't expect the same kind of match you got at Summerslam. 4.5/5

Unforgiven is a PPV that really just carried over storylines and feuds that were going on during the Invasion Period. I recommend this as a rental or possibably a purchase if you can get this some place cheap.",1235088000,,3477,4.506349206349206
