Be careful for false review such as ""A fan"" He's obviously and evolutionist who keeps posting the same lies and two star rating on all of Dr. Hovinds products. It just shows what kind of people the evolution theory makes people to be. I guess it's ok to lie though since there's no God huh...? What a joke.. I loved Dr. Hovinds products and I know you will too.",1459728000,,409,4.324675324675325
8152586,5,B000JOHKHI,"By far, this is the most needed DVD in anyones life.  If I had to choose to own only one DVD this would be the one!!! Packed with information that will open the eyes of any honest truth seeker.",1410825600,,193,3.948717948717949
8152587,5,B000JOHKHI,"This is my favorite DVD of the whole series.  The Hovind Theory blends scientific observations with Scripture in a fascinating explanation of what caused Noah's Flood, the Ice Age, the formation of coal, mountain ranges, and the Grand Canyon. Dr. Hovind gives logical answers to the physical anomalies that geologists cannot explain with the evolutionary theory.",1180742400,3,362,5.464285714285714
