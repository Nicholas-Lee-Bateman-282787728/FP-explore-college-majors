28570,5,0767802799,"Like many other reviewers, the first time I saw this film, I thought it was boring beyond words.  I think that I was expecting a ""chick flick"" and that's not what I got.
Upon second viewing, I realized  that I had missed the boat and that the film was absolutely brilliant in  every detail.  It simply does not take one false step in any way.  Performances, script, cinematography, score, sets, just  everything.
Personally, I believe that Ryder gives the performance of her  career as May.  Her performance is so subtle, so under the surface, that  many may dismiss it as one-noted.  Not so, not so at all.
I can only hope  that Scorsese puts a special edition on DVD so that I can enjoy it in all  of its sumptuousness over and over again.",964742400,5,741,4.447761194029851
28571,5,0767802799,"This is quite possibly one of the most visually stunning period pieces ever filmed.  From the gorgeous opening credits to the final, perfectly-composed shot, it is an aesthetic feast for any fan of the genre.
""The Age Of Innocence"" is one of my personal favorites.  The  film stays remarkably true to the Wharton novel, fleshing out details and  bringing the permeating emotion and atmosphere to life with exquisite  cinematography, directing, and acting.  Michelle Pfeiffer is superb as the  free-spirited but (unknowingly) scandalous Ellen Olenska, and Daniel  Day-Lewis provides a fine complement as Newland Archer (though I'd hesitate  to call it his best work--he comes across as rather spiritless at  times--that, and Pfeiffer steals the screen every shot she's in).  Winona  Ryder is somewhat forgettable next to Pfeiffer, but this could be  considered in keeping with their characters.
However.  ""The Age Of  Innocence"", in the tradition of character-driven period pieces, does  move at a slower pace and relies on subtext and subtleties (which the  acting and direction exemplify well), which many people find boring.  And  at nearly two and a half hours, there isn't much action to sustain someone  looking for an ""escape"" movie--unless, of course, you're escaping  to the lush but restrained world of Old New York.  Also, since this film is  such a departure from other Scorsese pictures, fans of his violent urban  dramas might be a little surprised.
However, if you've got some time you  can dedicate to watching this aesthetically gratifying portrait of desire  and sacrifice (and manipulation, how can we forget that?), I highly  recommend you pick it up.",960336000,17,1670,5.250950570342205
28572,5,0767802799,"The acting was superb, an surprised me, the set decoration was  wonderful. The detail of NYC and the mansions, table settings and even the food of that era were terrific. The love story though predictable was very good.  I'm ready, take me back the 1870's. Just kiding!",959126400,,269,4.702127659574468
28573,5,0767802799,"I have watched this film many times and have recommended it quite often.  I believe it to be one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, although a bit sad.  The dedication to detail in the flowers, table  settings, rooms, costume design is magnificent. It could not have ended any  other way.  Mr. Scorsese surprised me!",958521600,3,327,4.568965517241379
28574,5,0767802799,"Beautifully directed, ""Age of Innoncence"" transports me every time I see it.  The opening - from the daisies in Faust to the beautiful photography of the drawing rooms and ballroom - moves me every time:  the  very first time I saw this movie I knew it was a masterpiece.  The music,  the editing, the interesting audio choices (as when the backround noise in  the theatres fade or disappear completely during the private conversations)  are effective.  And the sexual tension you can cut with a knife...Joanne  Woodward's naration, just like Wharton herself, provides the perfect guide  to the underlying workings of her society.  It is also impressive how  closely the movie follows the novel - even some of the smallest details are  included.  A beautiful work with outstanding performances by the three  leads - they're also very pleasing to look at!  Also, catch Martin Scorsese  himself in a ""cameo"" as the photographer of May's wedding  portrait.",953856000,5,953,5.038709677419355
28575,4,0767802799,"I disagree with viewers who say that this is a story about a man who is forced to choose between infatuation and stable love; it is in fact about a man who is forced to choose between love and society. Actually, I believe  the catchcry was something like: ""What if the thing you desire most is  the one thing you cannot have? Which would you betray - your whole world,  or your heart?"" This sums it up perfectly. The film perfectly conveys  the emotions and characteristics of each of the main characters - chiefly  Newland's angst, May's subtle cunning, and Ellen's innocence and pain. The  scenes are beautiful, the camera work amazing, and the narrator slightly  irritating, I'm afraid. It was a little too excessive - do we really need  THAT much explanation? It was, however, useful in explaining little things  we would not be able to understand, like how the men had to change gloves  before dancing with different partners at balls (so we're told as Newland  deliberates over a table of pristine white gloves). The only other negative  thing I can think of is that the ballroom scene (where a ball is held to  welcome Countess Olenska) made me feel slightly nauseous (the camera  revolves around the room in swooping circles, seemingly for minutes). I  found that this negative effect was not replicated on the small screen,  however. As for the acting, it's perfect - actually, this was probably  Michelle Pfeifer's best performance - I wouldn't have believed her capable  of such brilliance. Daniel-Day Llewis is suitably English, reserved, and  introspective; Winona Ryder is perfect as ""innocent"", boring,  bitchy May. And the soundtrack is beautiful. See it.",948844800,5,1671,4.921146953405018
28576,5,0767802799,"What a masterpiece! What a pleasure for the eyes, ears, mind and soul! From the moment the rose starts to unveil and unveil, I entered an enchanted world and was transported to a new reality. And the reality that  Martin Scorsese creates here is so compelling it is difficult to return to  your everyday one.  I cannot think of a more perfect way to bring forward  the exquisite beauty of Edith Wharton's language than through the voice of  this narrator. The story and the voice are one, powerful and tempered, an  upscale and well behaved account, but with the incredible fine inflections  that hint only of deeper meanings, of compromising secrets, of high society  gossips. It is a love story  with no sexual scenes,  but in which the  tension builds up unbearably high. I enjoyed most of all the sense of  detail, the perfection of the scenes, each and every one a piece of art.  Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor, he created a perfect Newland Archer, a  complex and tormented character.  I am really grateful to Martin Scorsese  for this  movie I think about with the deep emotion reserved for beautiful  music or a few poems.",945216000,6,1132,4.659898477157361
28577,5,0767802799,"I had to see this movie because of a class I took at NYU and thought it was going to be a drag, but the unspoken details revealed with by the camera was a shock to me.  I was moved beyond understanding.  New Yorks'  life in the early 1870's comes very close to the cruel world of the 90s.  I  was brought back to an era that seemed familiar and very atractive, yet the  psychological  stresses inflicted by the high class would not waver me from  wanting to be Newland Archer and conquer the heart to the Countess.  I was  not surpriced by the ending for I would do the same.  Why re-live in the  precent what can not be erased from the past.  The music and the attention  to detail by the director will capture your imagination and send you into a  time warp to an era that will never come again.",914284800,3,797,4.117647058823529

It will hold your interest.  It illustrates how the Upper Class protects it's self interests which include family, reputations, and generational continuity among others.  They solve problems discreetly by closing ranks and protecting their own for the greater good.  A lesson lost on the Me Generation.

28583,5,0767802799,"Martin Scorcese does a fine job with this Edith Wharton book which is a real change of pace for him. Think: Martin Scorcese does Downton Abbey and you have the idea. This is one of the most incredible jobs of production design I have ever seen! The clothes, the sets, the set dressings and cinematography are eye dazzling. When these upper-class New Yorkers sit down to dinner, the plates meticulously match the tablecloth, the food matches the colors and designs of the dishes, which match the silverware and crystal. Everywhere you look is to be seen magnificent furniture, beautiful artwork, incredible wallpaper, etc. The plot was decent enough--although, like the plots of most Edith Wharton books, in the end the protagonist does not have the courage to overcome the limitations his society imposes upon him. Never the less, this film is a look into a time and place most of us have never seen. And what a sumptuous look it is! Although this is an Italian issued bluray, this disc does play on American players and is a fine looking bluray disc.

28584,1,0767802799,"The one-star IS NOT FOR THE MOVIE. I love the movie!!!! The one-star is for the rental price!  I am a proud and usually happy Amazon Prime member, and the number of movies available to watch are better than the previous movie app I had before.  However, quite a few of the movies of the type I love (historical and period movies, especially those made in the late '90's and 2000's) ARE NOT AMAZON PRIME. That was the case with ""The Age of Innocence"".  The movies which are NOT Prime tell you ""how to watch this"". That doesn't make any sense to me. It implies that if you ever rented the movie from Amazon in the deep dark past, you may be able to watch it for free.  I don't think, in my case, that that applies to many movies at all. I didn't have an iPad until 2011, so I mainly watched rented DVDs. SO, if I want to watch a Movie that IS NOT PRIME, I have to rent it. I'm not sure, but I think I had to rent this one for $3.99.  Once you start watching the rented movie, you can only have it for 48 hours. After 48 hours, it returns to movie land. However, you CAN RENT it, let it sit around in your device for months or years, and then watch it-IF YOU HAVENT ALREADY STARTED VIEWING IT. Please, Amazon, for the price I pay monthly for Prime and for ALL THE MONEY IVE SPENT ORDERING FROM AMAZON, I think you could give me a better deal on movies!  PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES PRIME ONES, GIVE US A LONGER RENTAL PERIOD FOR A LESSER PRICE, AND TREAT US BETTER. I also want to add that so many movies are in another language, with subtitles, particularly in the category of movies I like-historical, period pieces. There are plenty I would like to have watched, but reading subtitles and watching what's going on isn't my cup of tea. Well, that's a petty point.

28586,5,0767802799,I love this movie so much. Its a love story that takes your breath away but leaves you saddened by the two lovers not being able to be together.

The narration directly from Wharton's book adds to the atmosphere. The performances by Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer - two of the best of their generation - are mesmerizing. But the real treat is the subtle, charming performance of Winona Ryder, for which she won a Golden Globe and other awards and was nominated for an Oscar. Her depiction of a deceived wife, at first bewildered by her husband's cheating, and then rising to become just as manipulative as she needs to be, is deeply moving. The film was also nominated for best film and director (Martin Scorsese). This film sweeps you back in time to an age when the dinner tables of the New York elite were decorated with literal gold, and underneath all the beauty and rigid social code was a certain misery, whether one was a free spirit, or just trying hard to play by the rules.",1473292800,,1010,4.554945054945055

28651,5,0767802799,"One of the best Scorsese films ever made, IMHO, which happens to be his own opinion.  I've read the quote where he says this in one of his favorite of his own films. It's also wonderfully close to the book (worth a read, btw!).

The performances are fabulous. Daniel Day Lewis rarely disappoints -- I can't think of any of his work that can't be deemed very, VERY good to extraordinary -- and he is close to perfection as Archer.

Newland Archer -- what a character Wharton created.  One can pity him, find him eminently attractive as a young man, find abhorrent his subterfuges, admire his ambitions and stabs to be a truly good man, empathize with his fantasies, and hold him responsible for not being clear enough in examining his own mind and heart.  And, amongst all this, the stifling nature of his position, of the society around him, of the strictures, rules, and mores of the time and place leads to, throughout the story, a clear and sympathetic appreciation for the dynamics of Archer as a human struggling.  The elements of Life and the world he is in, the one he knows, the suffocation and oppression of his life imprisons his soul and dashes his very human needs -- no, NOT just that!.... It's in his need for personality and intellectual compatibility, which (trying for no spoilers here) he discovers too late, that make him tragic.

All of the minor characters play their roles wonderfully, believably, including some of the smallest roles. Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder's performances are some of their best work. They live their roles, and play them out, with nuance -- there is so much unspoken feeling, thought, need,  and agenda in these characters, and these women especially get it right, with a look, a tone of voice, the delivery of a brief line.  The sadness, hopes, sensitivity and poignancy of the Countess is expressed by Pfeiffer more completely than in any other of her roles, IMHO. She is a mixture of cynicism and vulnerability as drawn by Wharton. The limited, far too NON-intellectual May Welland is played so well by Ryder. The character of May, with those too shallow depths of mind and personality, is pitiable.  Then, when one can see (so subtly revealed by Scorsese and Wharton both, until one big, dramatic, statement at the end) that May has powerful instincts and sensitivity for and about Archer, the character joins the Countess in exhibiting stronger emotional responsibility than most of the male characters.

One could applaud so many of the actors and actresses individually -- just watch the film, then watch a second time when you want to, and note how each 19th C. character comes alive, even in parts that have few lines.  One notable -- Robert Sean Leonard, who appears in a brief but important role near the end, plays extraordinarily nicely, precisely, a well-written part that helps the audience jump the decades easily.

The production values are incredibly fine.  This film could be used as a tutorial in filmmaking education anywhere and everywhere. Sets, costumes, lighting, cinematography, editing -- more and more impressive upon each viewing. The Bernstein music is gorgeous, subtle, and precisely appropriate background.  The use of natural light, or the creation of what lighting was best, is throat-tightening and eye-stinging in the beauty of it all. The way the film was shot, the tiny details, the lovely images, the subtlety of the acting -- thank you, thank you, Mr. Scorsese.",1463875200,12,3454,4.890410958904109

Yes it is family friendly, safe for children and ok to watch in mixed company. It is a period piece happening before 1914 so If you don't like genteel old things or antiques, you may not relate to this. But you can't deny that it is romantic. Paul Newman's wife Joann Woodward narrates it in a polished prim and proper high society voice which is very enlightening.

28705,5,0767802799,"Because Martin Scorsese made his reputation with movies that were set in the poor neighborhoods of Mean Streets and Taxi Driver or the violent world of the mob, it was originally baffling to the public that he would attempt Edith Wharton's ""The Innocent Age"", set in the upper class society of 1870's New York. This surely, should be done by the Merchant-Ivory team, thought some. Others saw it as a stunt, the director trying to show he could do such a movie. Many people expected that Scorsese had overreached himself and awaited a failed film.

Instead, this film is a masterpiece for the director and everyone in it or connected with it. It really is after all, Scorsese's world, a world where invisible rules bind everyone and violation of those rules could lead to total disaster. These people talk more softly than the people of Goodfellas, have much better taste, and do everything in a circumspect fashion, but cross their rules and you would receive a social death virtually as fatal as a more primitive whacking by the mob.

The novel is adapted very faithfully and its tone is perfectly maintained. The costumes and sets are not only absolutely beautiful but also a commentary on the age, lovingly photographed by Scorsese's famously fluid camera which moves ceaselessly in this opulent world. Every scene has been well thought out and there are some dazzling moments, as when the Countess Olenska looks out at the ocean. The acting is perfect by the entire cast. (Some have complained about Daniel Day Lewis, but they were objecting to his character's personality and not him). Elmer Bernstein composed a magnificent orchestral score which accompanies the scenes perfectly without becoming overbearing.

I think you have to be inclined to like this type of film of manners set in the Nineteenth Century, and the general audience might not get it. But if you are inclined to appreciate this type of film, The Age of Innocence is practically perfect.",1440288000,21,1961,4.918429003021148

Superb sets and costumes alone do not make a great movie, and The Age of Innocence, in retrospect lacks a heart-felt, or at least, compelling center to elevate it beyond the usual waxworks in dumb show display. That said, the performances by all are truly solid. And Scorsese, bless him, always gives us something interesting to look at, even when the story lapses into ennui. Sony, in their infinite wisdom, has only released this title overseas. Mercifully, it's region free and can be played anywhere in the world. It looks and sounds positively gorgeous in hi-def, easily besting the old lack-luster DVD transfer that, by now, should be antique.

28740,3,0767802799,"Again, instead of allowing his characters to carry on conversations or the visual components of his art to speak, Scorcese, master of the voice over, violates a cardinal rule of cinema and allows the audience to forget the dream of the film by constant interruptions by a narrator.  Now a narrator provides a useful function in written fiction, but only disturbs the delicate fabric of film.  Why is it necessary for the narrator to point out what we are seeing?  ""Newland felt this and Newland felt that"".  This is superfluous at best as Mr. Lewis' visage and gestures, his mannerisms all convey the necessary information.  Why can't Scorcese allow his movies to speak for themselves?  Can you imagine ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Citizen Kane"" with voiceovers?  In the latter masterpiece Welles' has characters in the film speak their voice overs which is what one wishes this director would do.  Imagine the first scene of ""The Godfather"" with voice overs.  ""At that time it was customary for Mafia Dons to throw the most lavish weddings imaginable for their daughters in hopes that. . .""  Absurd.",1419984000,,1096,4.907608695652174

28745,5,0767802799,This is my favorite Daniel Day Lewis film. Winona Ryder was great too! I loved the use of a narrator throughout the movie.

28746,5,0767802799,"It's visually one of the most ravishingly beautiful films ever made. But like all highly sophisticated movies, there are many viewers who missed the point completely. When the film came out, and even more so now. The performances are perfect, Daniel Day-Lewis as the conflicted, loyal Newland trapped by the social 'mores' of the time, Michelle Pfeiffer as the breathless, more contemporary social misfit, and Winona Ryder as the seemmingly vacuous, steely May. There is one oddity however - some obviously fake matte painting that is so chocolate box that it has to be deliberate - is jarring, alongside the rest of the authentic looking visuals. I loved the narration too. To me, Joanne Woodward's creamy, seductive commentary on the action is one of the highlights. Her presence not only clarifies the action, but creates another invisible, all seeing, conspiratorial character, who obviously knows the outcome of the story. The use of colour is fabulous too, from the stunning opening titles, to the lavish interiors and costumes. It's a deeply moving film, with a subdued sexual tension which is extremely well done. The scene in a carriage involving Daniel Day-Lewis's hand in Michelle Pfeiffer's glove which has to be one of the most inspired piece of erotic 'business' I think I ever seen in a period film.

28751,5,0767802799,"20 years ago, this was a really fine period piece, retaining Wharton's sharp analysis of a social world she knew very well. Now, in our second Gilded Age, the repressions of and within the 1 percent have a new edge - money, manners, and family relations can be tipped into chaos by bad investments, for example. What strikes me today is how thoroughly everyone is branded, commodified, and how Newland and Ellen, in their urge to personal freedom, have no idea of the power of the forces arrayed against them.

It's also very clear, in this telling, that a good deal of that power is exercised among women in society - sub rosa, except for some male agents who carry the messages up the gender ladder. It's all brutal, behind the exquisite clothes, and flowers and food. Thank god there's no Lily Bart, but lives are ruined nonetheless; what could have been stands there, as an abandoned monument, shadows playing over futures not lived.

I've left out just how superbly this movie is made - things that put me off in ""Cape Fear"" work splendidly here. If you thought you'd taken it all in the first time, give it a second look.",1414195200,4,1127,4.574257425742574

It's an extraordinary look at circa 1880s wealthy New York. Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the hero's conflicted nature perfectly - striving to remain free of the narrow mores of 1880s wealthy New York society.

In an attempt to capture the character, he gave a listless, passionless, vapid performance. Now that I'm fully awake, I want to add that the movie is worth viewing but Day Lewis seemed to spend most of the picture trying to find his character, and, consequently, his performance came off as wooden, stilted and sleep-inducing. This might be due more to the director's trying to find the characters and the tone of the times.  Performances were good but not nuanced enough.

On this viewing, I found the omniscient narrator annoying.  Movies with narration are troubling.  The pictures and actions are supposed to tell the story.  In a movie where much of the action is implied and internalized, the narrator has to tell us what is going on.  This makes the movie slightly draggy.

I understand some of the older characters may not still be living but Daniel Lewis is now 57, the age he was at the end of this movie and now would be a good time to make Part II.

28785,4,0767802799,"I've seen this movie a few times.  At first, I was struck by the beauty of the settings, costumes and attention to detail, also the lighting.  It's a visually beautiful movie.  If you enjoy period movies and appreciate the aesthetics of movies, this will appeal to you.  The story is set in New York City, during the 1870's, at the height of high society.  This is a highly refined, restrained society that strictly adheres to traditional societal duties.. though, empty and a bit of a drudgery.  Appearances are extremely important.  Any deviation from the standard, however small, can shake up their world, and gossip, being snubbed and banned, is routine.  The movie begins with a scandalous, return of Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is seeking a divorce (almost unheard of then) from her philandering husband in Europe.  She is a cousin of May Welland (Winona Ryder) who is engaged to Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis).  Newland is persuaded to help the Countess, as she is frowned upon because of the pending divorce and her unconventional independence.  Newland finds her fascinating and exciting, and falls in love with her.  He becomes obsessed with her, and finds he is held by his engagement to May.  Overall, the performances are excellent.  Because of the period and society back then,conversation and mannerisms were very subtle and show restraint.  People didn't explode with their anger or frustrations, or were obvious in their impulsiveness.  Some people may find it very dull viewing.  If you like highly energetic, action-filled movies... then, this movie is not for you.  The plot moves slowly and has subtle touches.  The performances of Pefiffer, Day-Lewis and Ryder, the subtle mannerisms and emotions of their characters, came through well.  I think that's a hard  thing to convey successfully.  Joanne Woodward's narrative was an excellent touch, which also helped to keep the characters straight.  I have to admit, at times, I lost track of some of the characters.

I loved the attention to detail....from Granny  Mingett's Royal Darby china patterns to the serious discussion Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis) and May (Winona Ryder) have regarding what is the proper bouquet of flowers to send to their visiting cousin from Europe.
Ladies, could we have lived back in a time when a woman was not supposed to cross a ball room to speak to a gentleman seated across the room or taken a train to Washington D.C without a man to protect us?  Michelle Pfeifer is convincing as the poor little rich girl who has lived abroad with her foreign husband for the better part of her life, and comes back to New York seeking solace from his
indignations.
Of course she falls in love with Newland Archer who is betrothed to May but their love is stifled as all things were back in the Victorian era, especially among people in society. The men were big gossips as much as the women since they had nothing better to do with their free time after they had cut their cigar tips and talked with their brokers....
We are lead to believe Newland's young nave wife knows nothing of his obsession for the Countess (Pfeifer) but at the end of his life Newland's son confesses his mother's dying words included that she knew all along Newland had given up the one thing he loved to
stay true to his wife and family.

28799,5,0767802799,"""The Age of Innocence"" is one of the most beautiful films ever produced, with cast, crew, and design being all of A-list caliber. From the editing to the music scoring, this is an enrapturing experience. How Martin Scorsese fell from doing competent literary adaptations such as this to the perilous trash of today (the DiCaprio travesties ""Shutter Island"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") is a mystery that my mind does not care to comprehend. I guess everyone can get lost if he looks at the map too long. Do know, however, that this film is not for the short-attention span, peanut gallery-audience, so if your brain has been turned to swamp dust by these ""high concept"" action movies flooding the cinemas today, then you may not appreciate the powerful subtlety of this classic. This film features the best of Day-Lewis, and his interpretation of Newland Archer is one of the most powerful literary translations available on the movie market. The ending is a weeper, especially for Prufrocks out there, and Day-Lewis captures the internal torture of Archer splendidly. And how about Winona as May? I was impressed. And Michele Pfeifer--well, I just can't believe she didn't go on to do better things than she did on film. This was an auspicious performance indeed. A madman like Scorsese is so difficult to find in a relaxed and studied state, so this film is a must-see for that reason alone. If you love movies, then you are obligated to love ""The Age of Innocence"".
The DVD, though, is disappointing. I expected more extras, what gives? A 4-part documentary (featuring interviews with Scorsese, Day-Lewis, Pfeifer, and Jay Cocks) is available on YouTube, but not here! And why no up to date interviews? I'm not demanding a kidney here. But the picture and sound presentation are breathtaking, so that almost makes up for the lack of goodies...almost.

28804,5,0767802799,"Edith Wharton lived in New York at the end of the 19th century and captured the essence of Victorian society and its mores as displayed in New York.  Her ancestors were the Jones, of the ""keep up with the Jones"" expression.  However, her wealth, ability to travel to Europe and to her summer home in Massachusetts, and writing career gave her an independence most women of her age of innocence didn't have.  This independence allowed her to write about a time period and pass judgment on it.

In this love triangle, she weighs passionate love with obligatory love.  You can see the tension between the two and where her sympathies lie.  Of course, we know that passionate love doesn't always last, but it's hard to resist its heat.  In this love triangle Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is attracted to worldly and sophisticated Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), but feels obliged to marry the young, naive May (Winona Ryder), a cousin of Ellen's.  The dilemma for Archer is whether he should listen to his heart and pursue the Countess, who is recovering from a disastrous marriage and with whom a liason would be frowned upon by proper society?  Or should he succumb to a dull and society-sanctioned marriage with May?

Those familiar with Wharton know that her books rarely, if ever, have happy endings.  All of the actors are perfect for their roles.  Martin Scorcese has created a sumptuous film with fashion and sets that you can just look at with the volume off and be content.  The 1870's in fashion was a particularly beautiful age.  This film captures the essence of Wharton's novel and brings it lavishly to life.  It will make you glad that you didn't live in this time period, but it's fun to return to it as an observer.

If you like this film you might enjoy reading the author's autobiography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Backward-Glance-An-Autobiography/dp/B008BX2VS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Backward Glance [An Autobiography</a>].

28820,4,0767802799,"What struck me throughout the film was how well done the picture was made and how it stayed true to the novel. The Beaufort house for instance, is as I imagined it with ornate paintings, drapes, and intricate design. Usually the directors make many changes, as if they feel they can convey a better story than the actual classic author did, but this was not the case for The Age of Innocence. For instance, the costumes, which were first rate, only enhanced the feel of the story. May often wears white, representing her apparent naivet&eacute;, while Ellen, the more free-spirited and independent woman, is often seen in red with her blonde curls and red lips.

The acting was fantastic. Winona Ryder captured the character of May Welland seems unsuspecting and does not reveal that she is at all perceptive until later in the film. Daniel Day Lewis portrays Archer as a lawyer, part of traditional old New York, who is conflicted by his passion for Countess Olenska. His advice to Ellen wavers as in the novel. First he supports her right to divorce then convinces her that due to the traditional mindset of New York society, it is in her best interest to remain married. When he waivers once more saying he would have married Ellen if he could, she made him realize it was his own advice that led to the impossibility of their being together. Through her anger and tears, she says ""You don't know all the good you've done for me that I never knew....I can't love you unless I give you up."" This scene itself was emotional and reminded me of what a fine actress Michelle Pfeiffer is.

i guess because i've seen soooo many films that have the same theme 'conservative society strangles individualistic happiness and someone has to rebel against it' that i've kind of evolved to realize that societal cohesion does offer a benefit and a certain contentment that has been lost.

in all honesty...if i could be may welland and be doted upon by my husband and wear beautiful clothes, have servants and many children and the freedom to pursue my little interests and travel never have to worry that i would end up divorced and destitute...then hell yah, sign me up. so what if i have to put up with societies' rules? if archer was so very miserable then should have done what most men did in those times...have ellen as mistress on the side but be discreet about it. or broken off the engagement, people did back then and there wasn't any shame in it. somehow i doubt that men were so henpecked back then.

i don't know much about wharton but i suspect that had she been working in a sweatshop factory with no means of support her books would not have been so harsh on that way of life. she had her old monied established family to back her.

28841,2,0767802799,"Although I can enjoy stories of societies with plenty of rules, and obsessions with faddish luxuries, I found this film tedious, in spite of its visual beauty and sets that were apparently quite faithful to the period. Missing in action were the human beings who manage to make life interesting in spite of social constraints.

Before discussing the details, I must express my appreciation for Themis-Athena's well-written favorable review, which pays tribute to Edith Wharton's novel and defines its intent very well.

Two defects of the film are fatal enough to merit a cement burial. The conversation of the society is uniformly boring - primarily about possessions; fads including the sculpture of May's hands by an ""artist"" as kitchy as today's Kinkaid; empty gossip related to social rules. All this may be necessary to define the society, but there is too much of it and not enough real feeling to make the society human. By contrast, most films of ""Anna Karenina"" strike an acceptable balance between a formal society and its impassioned members. Yet the sets are beatifully realized, and the credits show that the set designer had the cooperation of Baccarat and Tiffany's. The second defect is Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. His mincing, quiet speech really annoyed me, and made it impossible for me to feel sympathy for his emotionally constipated character. To me, he sounded like a satirical immitation of John Malkovitch in ""Dangerous Liasons"" - which was released four years later, although Malkovitch as Valmont had bite. A more interesting directorial and scripting choice would have been to make Newland Archer more convincingly attracted to his wife May, so that there would be a stronger emotional conflict within him. As presented, his lack of interest in May made him seem more pointless, and not interesting enough to deserve the love of the more passionate Countess. If that was the best that New York high society had to offer, the Countess should have made an immediate U-turn for Europe.

Positive reviewers tried to defend the excessive use of narration - presumably with passages from the novel, but the narration in this film was much worse than it is in other films. The narrations were much too long, and therefore intruded on the actors. Second, actors sometimes repeated a line of the narration. I suppose the writers considered this to be cute, and might have been trying to play with the relationship between drama and life, as they did quite obviously by the use of operas and plays. Although a narration is sometimes a sign of laziness or frustration, I would consider this to be simply a failed effect.

In spite of the challenges of a script that constrained like a tight corset, there were some excellent performances. Wynona Ryder's appearance was perfect for her smallish part, and she was in many ways an exception to the general emotional shallowness of the film. While appearing to be innocent, her nuanced facieal expressions and body language as May showed how this story could be brought to life. It made her convincing as she executed extremely precise tactics in dealing with her husband's psyche, while playing by the rules of her society. Michelle Pfeiffer turned in an excellent performance as her cousin Ellen the Countess. Always interesting, and capable of acting very sexy, she measured her performance as apropriate to the part.  Some changes in the writing and in the directing of Day-Lewis could have improved her side of the triangle. Even the first scene at the opera didn't seem exactly right. Other reviewers have commented on several excellent performances in the minor roles, especially Miriam Margolies as a credible and human matriarch, and Stuart Wilson as a stereotypical unfaithful Victorian husband.

Although I felt the first three quarters of the film were difficult to enjoy, I found the plot turns in the last quarter to be interesting and amusing.  The epilogue, set twenty years after the main action of the story seemed to be an unnecessary waste of camera time.

The camera work was excellent, in my opinion. One reviewer complained about unusual angles, but I found them interesting and tasteful.

With a major restructuring of the characterizations, and greater humanity in the social scenes, and finer tuning of the emotional development, this story could be interesting, and would justify the expense of so many beautiful costumes and sets, enhanced by great camera work.",1363564800,5,4457,5.069577080491133

28856,4,0767802799,"Edith Wharton wrote American literature that reads like English: very proper upper crust in New York instead of London, but otherwise very similar. And into this stiff society came the countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), an American who married a count and lived to regret it. We never get a lot of detail, but apparently the count was pretty beastly, although perhaps not quite Dracula.

So Ellen returned to her family in New York just after her cousin May Welland (Winona Ryder) has gotten engaged to the charming but somewhat distant attorney, Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis). Ellen and Newland remember one another as children, but they are certainly not children any longer.

Can one make a story of forbidden love in 1993 that goes no further than some rather passionate kissing with all their clothes on? Well, he makes one very big deal out of unbuttoning her glove at one point so he can kiss her wrist. The answer is yes, if your writer is from the era when that's the way writers did it: all innuendo and thwarted desire.

One of the most amusing characters is great Aunt Mingott (Miriam Margolyes), who with the best of intentions in the world, has her finger on every pulse and in every pie from her first floor bedroom to which her obesity confines her. You might be tempted to call her an old busybody, but she really does have her family's happiness at heart, and is a deft manipulator. A couple of years ago, I would have delighted to play the role.

Winona Rider is adorable, and a competent actress. The role has more scope than it seems to at the beginning, and she rises to it. I'm going to have to look for what she's done more recently.",1336608000,,1670,4.6127946127946124
28857,1,0767802799,"An overrated forgettable movie.

The novel by Wharton is already hard to read, as it is pure navelstaring by a rich woman trying to make her fellow rich people look ridiculous.

Most common people do not waste their life the way these bored upper class people do. Normal people are instead productive and take pride in that.

This movie is one longwinded pile of dialogues about trivia, without passion or any other emotion, certainly lacking the original humorous style (which was the sole redeeming aspect of Wharton's work).

Action you won;t find much here.

The characters are all unpleasant One would not want them as one's friends. They are either weaklings or moochers. No heroes here.

28863,2,0767802799,"Edith Wharton's The Age of Innocence is so many things: witty, subtle, satirical, and tongue-in-cheek melodramatic, not to mention populated by deceptively complex characters. Martin Scorcese's adaption, unfortunately, is none of these.

A fan of both classic literature and costume dramas, I understand that there are always necessary changes that must be made when converting a book to film. However, when the entire tone and purpose of a work is changed, I have to object. Wharton's somewhat affectionate fun-poking at her New York society is completely drowned out by weepy music and over-the-top romance. Not even her own writing can save this movie, as evidenced by the stiff and misguided narration, which takes its passages directly from the book.

All in all, although beautiful, this adaptation is lazy and inconsistent.  The acting goes from extremely dramatic to completely flat, and I'm not convinced that anyone involved with this film really ""got"" Wharton's novel. After viewing it, I was baffled by the discrepencies between the glowing reviews and what I had just watched.

If you enjoyed the movie, but have not read the book, then I highly recommend it. The Age of Innocence is a wonderful American novel, and the story is told in a much more playful voice with more richly developed characters.",1315008000,11,1314,5.154929577464789

The accused lady played by Michelle P.

I was sadly disappointed after viewing it.  Although it was extremely beautiful to look at and the attention to details by the art director impeccable, it was leaden and boring.  I agree with another reviewer who said that they were not happy with the odd camera techniques employed...for seemingly no good reason.  It was very distracting.  The acting was sufficient.  I was particularly impressed with Winona Ryder's work.  Never one of my favorites, she was able to convey with subtlety, the turmoil and anger her character was feeling underneath a surface of sweetness and calm.  I wouldn't have thought her capable of such a performance.  When it was over, I found myself thinking, ""Where did it all go wrong and why didn't it work?""

28874,2,0767802799,"The first wrong note comes with the opening credits, those silly roses and tulips blooming over and over and over in a time-lapse parody of abundance. What was initially pretty becomes tedious and rote. And while Miriam Margolyes has a few apt moments of mercilessly poking fun at her pretentious family (while colluding with them jovially), all the actors and most especially the director misunderstand every basic point of Wharton's brilliant, tragic novel.

To put it crudely, there are two basic truths to her story: 1) the rules of New York aristocratic society are stultifying, conservative and repressive. 2) May is the villain.

But Scorsese's camera engages in an endless orgy of materialistic consumption, one that celebrates rather than condemns the rewards of wealth. And to cast winsome, fey Ryder as the athletic, stolid and ploddingly dull May? She's supposed to be the woman Newland is virtually forced into marrying, the safe choice that has the stamp of destiny from all their friends. Not the magical, doomed creature he actually desires who appears unexpectedly in the person of the Countess. The Countess is a European evocation of values beyond those of his circle, and Pfeiffer does the best of the three in her thankless role; she at least looks beautiful and fragile.

However she's supposed to be that half-glimpsed dream he fails to realize, not the temptress intent on foiling his destiny with her witchy ways. Newland is to be pitied, and the ultimate sense is that true passion is the missed opportunity of his life. Instead we wonder how he could ever have been tempted to abandon the charming May, much less risk throwing away his assured future for such a meager prize. Which is an altogether different message than Wharton intended, and it leaves the film rather inert and confusing. The plot and the characters no longer match up.

It's ironic that Joanne Woodward provides so much lugubrious narration, as it seems the film-makers were as little interested in what she was saying as the audience would eventually be.",1292198400,8,2052,5.008797653958944

That is the Gilded Age, and nobody knew its hypocrises better than Edith Wharton. And while you wouldn't expect Martin Scorsese to be able to pull off an adaptation of her novel ""The Age of Innocence,"" this movie is a trip back in time to the stuffy upper crust of ""old New York,"" taking us through one respectable man's hopeless love affair with a beautiful woman -- and the life he isn't brave enough to have.

Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis), of a wealthy old New York family, has become engaged to pretty, naive May Welland (Winona Ryder). But as he tries to get their wedding date moved up, he becomes acquainted with May's exotic cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), who has dumped her cheating husband.

At first the two are just friends, but after Newland marries May, the attraction to the mysterious Countess and her free, unconventional life becomes even stronger, but he's still mired in a 100% conventional marriage, job and life. Will he become an outcast and go away with the beautiful countess, or will he stick with May and the safe, dull life that he has condemned in others?

Yeah, I kind of blinked when I found out that the subtle, bittersweet Wharton novel set in a gilded upper-crust New York... was being directed by the guy who also did ""Raging Bull"" and ""The Gangs of New York."" But fortunately Scorses sticks closely to the original novel -- we even have an omniscient narrator who quotes directly from Wharton's book as she describes New York society.

He preserves Wharton's portrayal of New York in the 1870s -- opulent, cultured, pleasant, yet so tied up in tradition that few people in it are able to really open up and live. It's a haze of ballrooms, gardens, engagements, and careful social rituals that absolutely MUST be followed, even if they have no meaning.

And he delicately brings out the powerful half-hidden emotions that the story revolves around. One great example: a sexy carriage ride where Newland slowly unbuttons Ellen's glove and gently kisses her pale wrist -- it's sensual and erotic without being explicit.

Day-Lewis gives the awesome performance you would expect -- his Newland is stiff and repressed, and nowhere near as awesomely unconventional as he thinks himself to be. Pfeiffer and Ryder don't physically look like May and Ellen, but they give excellent performances: Ryder plays a seemingly innocent, naive young woman who shows hints that she's a lot smarter than Newland thinks, while Pfeiffer plays a more worldly noblewoman who craves love and kindness.

28879,5,0767802799,"This is one of the few movies that really changed my life.  I have read the book, and I do understand that this movie is not neccasarily the best representation of that, but I have to remind people that there are a lot of very faithful movies that fail as movies.  I know a lot of people who will never love Kubrick's the Shining because it is so different from the book that they can't love the film for being a great, but different film.  This movie is not as subtle as the book, and the directiion to the actors is not to indicate so.  However, I still read a lot of reviews that the movie was still too slow.  The movie is georgious and slow and romantic.  The film is about a lawyer who is engaged to May, but falls in love with Michelle Pfiefer's character.  DDL is tired of social norms, and so is she, though they can not be together, because she can't get divorced from her husband.  The beginning of the film is about his longing for her, and trying to get around social graces to be with her, and it rings true of first love or puppy love, before she goes back to her husband, and he gets married to May.  She comes back and he is after her again with burning loins, until finally she refuses him.  May confronts him with her pregnancy, and DDL makes the responsible solution to settle down.  What is most striking is that he is happy, and in his old age, after May dies, he is too content to go after his old flame.  He has led a content life.  Ultimately what is striking to me, is that under the pompousness of the society, they are looking out for his best interest, trying to save him from himself.  The current culture to follow your heart or what's in your pants doesn't work.  The Upper class got that way and remain that way because of rules, and you shouldn't throw your life away at rebelious youth.  He makes a smart decision.  It's not hollywood, or sexy, but is happy with his children and the life they have together at the end of his life that he can look back and have no regrets.",1281139200,7,2008,4.201044386422977
28880,5,0767802799,"I tried watching this on a hot evening and it put me right to sleep. When I woke up, I started over and this time it held my interest until the very end. It reminded me a lot of Sofia Coppola's Marie-Antoinette in that it was a period drama with lavish costumes, lavish banquets, ballroom dancing, and scenes in the opera; in this case it opens as the 1870 New York audience is enjoying a performance of Charles Gounod's ""Faust."" Faust made a bargain with the devil, but these people are in The Age of Innocence, so no such bargains are in effect, though perhaps everyone isn't as innocent as they seem. The problem with films like this is that not much happens, and the opulent lifestyle soon grows boring.

Also, while mostly it is better to show instead of tell, it is too difficult to navigate the customs of these strange people, and the director, Martin Scorsese, relies on a narrator, Joanne Woodward, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Eve, a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder in ""The Three Faces of Eve."" Interestingly, she was also the narrator for a film made in 1959 of William Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury"" where she was the voice of Quentin, a male character. In this film based on the novel by Edith Wharton, Woodward is no doubt providing the authorial voice of Wharton.

There is a love triangle with Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis), Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), and May Welland (Winona Ryder). Newland marries May, but his heart really belongs to Ellen. She is married to a Count and has come over the Atlantic to stay with relatives in New York. She cares little for their quaint customs and is in danger of being ostracized but Newland intervenes. Ellen is May's cousin, and on the surface May seems to encourage Newland to help her cousin, but soon May, and the whole of New York society, seems to suspect that Newland and Ellen are having an affair. The love triangle reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" where he loves one woman but feels a strong connection with another who understands him on a deeper level. The derby? Anyone? All three give strong performances, with Winona holding back a lot, seeming to be kind of vapid, but actually understanding and enduring more than you realize to hold her marriage and family together. Pfeiffer stands out the most, and Daniel holds it together, but what is up with those hats? Actually, he wears a pretty cool hat that was probably the height of fashion back in 1870, kind of a cross between a fedora and something a viceroy would wear in a Rembrandt painting.

----------------------
Ellen Olenska: Is fashion such a serious consideration?
Newland Archer: Among those who have nothing more serious to consider.
=================

Speaking of paintings, there are a lot of great ones in the set design. The whole opulent society feel is fabulous, and there is also great classical music by Beethoven, Johann Strauss I and II, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, as well as an original score composed by the great Elmer Bernstein. The Age of Innocence is a class act all the way, really uncharacteristic of director Martin Scorsese, but obviously a film that was for him very heartfelt. He dedicated it to his father, just as Oliver Stone dedicated Wall Street to his father. It is kind of slow moving, but give yourself up to this reverie of those halcyon days of 1870, and you'll enjoy The Age of Innocence.

--------
Ellen Olenska: I think we should look at reality, not dreams.
Newland Archer: I just want us to be together!
Ellen Olenska: I can't be your wife, Newland! Is it your idea that I should live with you as your mistress?
Newland Archer: I want... Somehow, I want to get away with you... and... and find a world where words like that don't exist!

28881,4,0767802799,"In 19th century New York high society, Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is engaged to the conventional May Welland (Winona Ryder). Things start to change for Newland when May's cousin, the unconventional Dutchess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), moves to New York following the separation of her and her Polish Count husband. As Newland helps her through legal matters Newland begins to fall in love with her, and begins to question his relationship with May.

Martin Scorsese had been considering making a romance for years, but could never seem to find the right project. Then in 1980 screenwriter Jay Cocks gave Scorsese a copy of Edith Wharton's book The Age of Innocence saying, ""When you do that romantic piece, this one is you."" Seven years later, Scorsese finally read the book and decided to make the movie. Not only did he make the movie, he got his first choice for the three leads in the cast.

This movie gives an interesting look into the gossipy nature of old school high society New York. Through the narration of the movie you really feel like you're being thrust into the middle of these people's lives. You hear the gossip, see the backstabbing, and deal with the ""rules"" of residing in high society. It's because of the toying with emotions and backstabbing that occurs in high society that Scorsese said this is the most violent movie he ever made.

In high society it's only natural that people will hide their true feelings beneath the surface, and here the actors due a superb job at exemplifying that trait. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as a the man torn between his fiance and her cousin, but trying to hide it from the world. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as the woman who catches Newland's heart with her unorthodox behavior. But it's Winona Ryder who steals the show. As May, she plays a character who acts clueless, but underneath she's broken by what's going on and plotting to keep her husband.

If you like period dramas or Scorsese films I highly recommend this film. To be honest, I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about this movie when I was first done watching this, but in the time since I've thought about it and I have to admit that I'm definitely going to be watching it again. Scorsese definitely scored another masterpiece with this '93 period romance.

Now let me say a few good things about the film. First, the costumes and settings are excellent. I think it was the only thing really done well here, and maybe well enough to redeem the film if you are willing to watch it muted - which I recommend. Second, at least Winona Ryder can act.

Let's be frank: Scorsese, Pfeiffer and Day-Lewis had no business being associated with this film. Like the screenwriter, they do not seem at all to have understood that the dialogue is supposed to be subtle, to mean more than it says. Most of the innuendo of the book's dialogue is gone, and nothing worthwhile has taken its place. The narration is particularly bad. Meanwhile, the actors (excepting Ryder) throw themselves around melodramatically as if incapable of making small gestures seem important. People constantly lose their tempers. It's closer to Raging Bull with pretty furniture than to Wharton's The Age of Innocence.

Winona Ryder struggles to seem as innocent as May is supposed to seem, but she's the only person involved with this film who seems to have understood the story; she would surely have made an excellent Olenska. If I had the money, I think I would pay the movie to be re-made with her in that role.",1264291200,7,1681,5.335849056603774
28884,4,0767802799,"Going into The Age of Innocence, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Martin Scorsese has been one of my favorite directors for some time now yet this is a film that I have always put off watching. To me, looking at the cover box and watching the trailer, I expected little more than beautiful eye candy with three attractive stars. What exactly could Scorsese bring to the issue of high society in the 1800's that hasn't been already addressed? As it turns out, quite a bit.

With The Age of Innocence, Scorsese plays against type (if doing so as a director is possible) and dives straight into a genre that he is both not well known for as well as not directly familiar with. His lavish art direction and assured directing help make a familiar tale of doomed love breathe with new life. For example, one element of the film that I found fascinating was the film's use of colors to represent themes of the various characters. I love how the ""forbidden"" Ellen is always shown in dark, startling colors like bright blues, vibrant yellows, and blood reds whereas the pristine imagine of Mae is shown through light colors like soft, delicate pastels. As for the acting, I found it all to be uniformly superb. From Michelle Pfeiffer, as the fallen from grace Ellen, to the underrated work of Winona Ryder, as uptight May Welland, it all works.

As for the twist ending, I wasn't really all that surprised. (SPOILER ALERT)For a movie that is very beautifully mounted and fully aware of its style over substance, it should come as no surprise that Archer doesn't end up with Ellen. In reality, he wouldn't have either. Image meant a lot in the 1800's...and still does today. Why give up his vision of perfection when it may not honestly be perfection at all? Our imagination of perfection is a lot more powerful than our reality of it.",1262131200,,1830,4.610429447852761
28885,5,0767802799,"Having read Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name, I have observed that Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder should have had opposite roles, as they would have then better fit the descriptions of their respective characters, Ellen Olenska and May Welland. However, the acting of both was superb, as was that of Daniel Day-Lewis as society lawyer, Newland Archer, and the rest of the cast.
  Our setting is that of New York Society in the 1870s. We begin with a night at the opera, and with Joanne Woodward's  appropriately genteel narration, we become acquainted with this rareified world--the veneer of which could be ruffled by the slightest hint of scandal. Students of the Victorian age may admire the meticulous attention paid to the details of dress, jewels, meals, etiquette, accessories, architecture, paintings, gifts given on appropriate occassions, social mores, the symbolism of flowers presented to ladies, etc.
  Camera lenses pan across opera boxes, ballrooms, dining room tables, enchanting gardens, and a wealth of art on museums and household walls.
 Amid the mildly expressed indignation of Sillerton Jackson and Larry Lefferts(Alec McCowen and Richard E. Grant),the societal experts on family histories and on form, Countess Ellen Olenska, May's European-raised cousin, who is something of a persona non grata among New York Society because she is separated from her husband, joins the newly engaged May and her mother (Geraldine Chaplain) in their opera box, and are later joined by Newland, May's fiance. The characters of the two female leads are well represented by Gabriella Pescucci's costumes--Ellen's sharp sweetheart-necklined royal blue satin, and May's pallid tulle-laden gown which makes the latter look ethereal, seem to represent experience and innocence. Ellen spends much time clad in rich jewel tones.
 At the moment Newland greets her in the box, the Countess, whispering delicately about her earlier acquaintance with those present, gracefully sweeps her fan over the audience beneath her to illustrate the point she is making.
 At the annual ball given my Mr. and Mrs. Julius Beaufort(Stuart Wilson and Mary Beth Hurt), May shows off her engagement ring, and chats pleasantly with her fiance.
 May's grandmother, Mrs. Manson Mingott(Miriam Margoyles), is delighted by the engagement, and wants to give the wedding breakfast. As the story progresses, the obese couch-ridden matriarch will act as an adviser on the marital dilemmas of her kinfolk, sometimes to her own distress.
 As his own wedding day approaches, Archer discusses Ellen's situation with law firm partner Mr. Letterblain(Norman Lloyd), and tries to beg off taking her case.
 Newland and May marry, honeymoon in Europe, and still find Ellen's issues awaiting them upon their return. Newland is torn between his attraction to the unconventional Countess, whose disregard for a few societal customs, such as wearing red at formal gatherings,  leaving one gentleman's company to talk to another at such gatherings, and her private habit of smoking when that was unacceptable behavior for women--and the more conventional, sweet and docile May, whom he fears has no real depth.
 He will learn much later how false this impression really is.
 Manning this opulent Oscar-nominated effort is Martin Scorsese, who cameos as a wedding photographer, and gives bit parts to various members of his family, including his daughter, Domenica, whose Katie Blenker's  mindless chatter with Newland reveals her to be a young lady typical of her time and social standing. Sian Phillips and Carolyn Farina portray Newland's dependant mother and sister, Jonathan Pryce is the Frenchman Riviere, Michael Gough and Alexis Smith play the King and Queen of New York Society, Henry and Louisa Van der Luyden, and Robert Sean Leonard plays the Archer's son.
 Michael Baullhaus' cinematography is soft, natural, and glowing, and we are ultimately presented with a look into a bygone era of annual rituals of formality, subtle assaults on the psyches of those wishing to break free from them, and amid the unseen inner turmoil of some, a poignant underestimation of one woman's understanding of her husband's private, unexpressed anguish.",1258934400,,4235,5.374622356495468
28886,5,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese's film The Age of Innocence (1993) is an adaptation of a 1920 novel by Edith Wharton, which won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize. Both, the novel and the film are set in upper class New York City in the 1870s.

The Age of Innocence is the movie that proves once again what a versatile talented, unpredictable, incredibly passionate, and artistically outstanding director Martin Scorsese is. Recently I saw for the first time Scorsese's comedy After Hours and was fascinated how masterful he was in creating a darkly funny surreal comedy. Now, after re-watching The Age of Innocence, I am sure that Scorsese has made one of the most beautiful, tragic, passionate, sensual, sexually charged screen romances ever, which is at the same time perfectly suitable for the whole family watching. It is PG rated, and the characters speak in refined, almost forgotten English. The director himself described The Age of Innocence as the ""most violent"" film he's ever made, clearly referring to the inner turmoil, disappointment and resignation the two main characters of this drama go through.

The material world Scorsese created and paints with his lenses is of incredible beauty. Michael Ballhaus' camera brings out the perfection of craftsmanship of every object it looks at: be it the costumes (Oscar statuette for Gabriella Pescucci who has dressed the heroes of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Der Name der Rose (1986), and Upon a Time in America (1984) to name a few), china, crystal, silver, flower arrangements, jewelry or furniture. The exquisite meals looked delicious and required a special food consultant who was mentioned in the film's credits. Or take for example these elegant leather ladies gloves with small buttons. Who would think that unbuttoning a glove on the hand of a beautiful woman slowly, tenderly, makes one of the most erotic scene ever filmed? The people who inhabited this world of beauty, comfort, and privilege seem the perfect happy creatures but not all is so perfect in the paradise. Two beautiful passionate people found love that could only happen once in a life time but the strict norms or society they live in and the unbending unwritten rules based on convention and hypocrisy they must obey won't permit them to follow their hearts freely, to fulfill their desire, and to be happy in that Age of Innocence. The cast is superb, and includes Daniel Day-Lewis, the film protagonist Newland Archer, Michelle Pfeiffer, as Countess Olenska, a woman with ""a Past"" who stole his heart, and very young Winona Ryder, May Welland, the girl whom Archer will marry. 22 years old Ryder very deservingly received the Oscar nomination for her performance. I would like to mention Joanne Woodward's subtle narrating of Edith Wharton's prose which is one of the high points of the film. IMO, the film has only high points and is Martin Scorsese fine (perhaps, the finest) and stunning achievement.",1257552000,3,2973,5.0653061224489795

The film was tedious, the characters were irritating, the plot was dreary (and not in a good, redeemable way).  I was glad at the end because 1) it was over, thank goodness! and 2) none of the characters ended up happy.  This is, of course, a terrible thing to say, but I didn't think any of them deserved happiness, and they certainly didn't deserve each other - they were all horribly mismatched.

28894,5,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese directing a Merchant-Ivory film might superficially describe ""The Age of Innocence,"" but it would do an injustice to both parties. This is a Marty movie through and through -- beautifully filmed, expertly acted, and thematically obsessed with guilt, passion, and moral failings.

In adapting Edith Wharton's classic novel of forbidden love in a repressive society, Scorsese has an anthropologist's obsessive eye for cultural detail -- the cutlery, the dainty dishes, the linen, the clothes. And of course the social rituals -- the after-dinner brandy & cigar, opera-going audience gazing, and the handwritten notes attached to bouquets of flowers. The attention to surface texture in the film has a transporting effect; it is one of the best period pieces ever made.

Time-traveling to an unfamiliar milieu freed Scorsese's aesthetic instincts. ""The Age of Innocence"" is hardly a polite study of quaint social customs; it is a passionate, adventurous film, dripping with color and breathtaking compositions. Scorsese revels in the texture of the world he and his collaborators have painstakingly recreated, a world where passions are lidded but bubble over in the form of colorful flower bouquets and passionate opera arias. This film belongs on a shortlist of the most physically ravishing films ever made (and not just because of Michelle Pfeiffer), but because Scorsese cuts loose with his painterly style of image-making.

Though a PG-rated period piece might seem like a departure for Scorsese, he observed that ""This film deals with the same matters that can be found in my work in the last 25 years. There is guilt, desire, obsessed passion and the weakness to satisfy that passion."" Notice how he describes the desire to satisfy passion as a ""weakness."" Where most directors would romanticize the love affair between Newland and the Countess, Scorsese sees it as doomed from the start, and he is careful not to make either character (especially Newland) too sympathetic. Newland has eaten of the fruit of passion, and the fact that Scorsese does not (necessarily) valorize his passion makes the film that much more interesting. Newland's choice was between duty and passion, honor and real love. A less astute, less interesting filmmaker than Scorsese would have made the choice a no-brainer, damn the consequences. For most modern storytellers, passion is paramount. Passion is freedom. For Scorsese, passion has a dark side. Although he recognizes the hypocrisy and barely-concealed vindictiveness of aristocratic society, there remains something recognizably Old World about his sensibilities.",1235952000,2,2620,5.416666666666667

Michelle Pfeiffer turns in a radiant performance in her effort to negotiate these overstuffed rooms and overwrought sensibilities, but can't quite manage it.

The stumbling point, in my view, Daniel Day-Lewis here plainly just doesn't cut it as a leading man. His emasculated, simpering deadpan, dispensing dialogue medicinally as so much cough syrup, completely fails to engage as a romantic figure. The notion of Michelle's ravishing, vivacious character head over heels for him is more than a stretch. I've seen gunfighters with more chemistry than these two. Their first intimate scene, eek! Comes off like a stumble in a crowded bus. This mis-casting is disappointing, as the movie appears in many ways to have had real promise.

28899,4,0767802799,"More renowned for his action and crime films, ""The Age of Innocence"" just happens to my favorite of Scorsese's works.  It isn't perfect, but it's very, very good.  Based on the eponymous novel by the great American writer, Edith Wharton, the film exposes the unwritten but ironclad social mores, and their attendant hypocrisies, of upper-class New York society in the late nineteenth century.  Therefore, this film required the director to make his points in a subtler manner than we are accustomed to seeing from Scorsese.  On that score (subtlety), I know some Wharton fans who were outraged by Scorsese's imposition of the voiceover (beautifully handled by Joanne Woodward) throughout the film, but this didn't bother me.

The film's central character is Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), a respected lawyer and member of one of New York City's oldest and best-connected families.  Although Newland harbors a more questioning view of his social circle than its other denizens, he feels his membership in this circle strongly enough to honor what he feels are the best of its traditions.  His recent engagement to May Welland (Winona Ryder), a fresh, pretty, and irreproachable young girl from a family exactly like his own, expresses Archer's solidarity with those traditions.  May is unimaginative and, in her demure way, extremely controlling, but Archer does not seem to expect a wife who embodies all May's virtues, yet shares his interest in art and books, and who can also join him in privately questioning the way things are always done in their world.

As the film opens, May's cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), has just arrived in New York City from Europe, fleeing an abusive, dissolute, and unfaithful husband.  She hopes to divorce him and re-establish herself close to her family in New York.  Ellen is the ""black sheep"" of the Welland/Mingott clan - her somewhat bohemian parents dragged her around Europe as she grew up, lavishing on her, as her grandmother Mingott puts it, ""an expensive but incoherent education"".  Nevertheless, Granny Mingott, the matriarch of this family, dotes on her unusual and artistic granddaughter and shelters her.  Very quickly after meeting Ellen, Newland sees in her the depth, charm, sophistication, and passionate nature that he might have wished for in his own wife, and he recognizes the difference in the feelings she arouses in him from the ones engendered by May.

Newland's rapidly growing feelings for his soon-to-be cousin are further complicated by his law firm's request that he handle the matter of Ellen's divorce. But their preferred method of his handling it, as they instruct Newland, is to dissuade Ellen from seeking one at all.  Thus, Newland is placed in the awkward position of persuading Ellen not to pursue the very freedom that would make her legitimately available to him.  The Count Olenska has apparently forwarded letters to New York accusing Ellen of adultery with his secretary (Jonathan Pryce), who in reality simply helped Ellen escape her husband's reach.  As Newland points out to Ellen: ""Our laws favor divorce, but our social customs do not, especially if the woman has appearances in the least degree against her.""  Ellen insists that the Count's letter is full of lies, but she reluctantly agrees to follow Newland's advice, and decides to spare the family potential scandal by not seeking a divorce.  Ellen's acquiescence is also rooted in her growing reciprocal feelings for Newland, whose blend of compassion, thoughtfulness, and integrity has touched her.

Thus, an impossible situation arises: Newland and Ellen have fallen in love, but as she has agreed not to divorce the Count in order to spare her family embarrassment, there is no point in Newland breaking his engagement.  The trapped and embittered Newland sees no other destiny for himself than to go through with his marriage to May.  He does so, and tries to put Ellen out of his mind as he and May embark upon their married life.  But a series of incidents brings Ellen and Newland close together once more, and eventually those around them, including May, discern the feeling between them, and conclude that they are lovers (although Newland and Ellen never do consummate their love).

The social circle of hypocrites and moralists rallies around May and brings about a final separation between Newland and Ellen without anyone, including May, uttering aloud the slightest accusation of adultery.  May's only interest is in salvaging her marriage and keeping her husband, and her careful control of her inner feelings, and her production of her trump card at the eleventh hour, in the form of her early pregnancy, seal Newland's fate.

The performances are excellent all around.  Day Lewis is deeply affecting as the conflicted and trapped Newland.  Michelle Pfeiffer, as Ellen Olenska, gives a heartfelt performance, despite seeming oddly unsuited to period costume - she walks awkwardly in the long dresses and bustles of the era.  But she conveys the charmingly impulsive nature, depth of feeling, and capacity for sacrifice that so endears Ellen to Newland.  The role of May Welland was one of Winona Ryder's best performance (she was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress for it).  Ms. Ryder does not have much range, but this quality was perfect for May, the hallmark of whose persona is ""a hard, bright, blindness"".  The era's social mores are are also referenced by subplots, most notably the problematic marriage of Julius and Regina Beaufort (a strong performance by British actor Stuart Wilson as Julius).  A group of exceptional supporting actors rounds out the cast: Mary Beth Hurt (Regina Beaufort), Geraldine Chaplin (May's mother), Sian Phillips (Newland's mother), Alec McCowen (Sillerton Jackson), and Richard Grant (Larry Leffert).  Miriam Margulies is outstanding as Granny Mingott, and viewers with long memories may be touched to see the elegant Alexis Smith in a cameo as the elderly, aristocratic, Louisa Van der Luyden.

The production is not merely beautiful, it is breathtaking.  Nothing was spared to illustrate the sumptuous material values of this small circle who inhabited the azure realms of New York society at the time, the solid descendants of successful Dutch and English settlers.  The exquisite food, flowers, jewelry, clothing, china, and silver, are themselves a feast for the eyes.  Unsurprisingly, the film won an an Academy Award for its costumes, which are ravishing.  The late Elmer Bernstein's somber ironic score was also nominated for an Oscar, as was the script done by the director and Jay Cocks.

The pace of the film has been called slow, but this reviewer did not find it so; rather, the pace allows room for a welcome (and these days, distressingly rare) establishment of character, which in turn lends the film richness.  It is true that Wharton's novel is still more nuanced than this film, but it would have been impossible to convey all the subtle nuances expressed there in any film.  In this reviewer's opinion, Scorsese did an excellent job of bringing to the screen Wharton's cautionary tale of the price exacted by society for comfortable membership: for some, the betrayal of the self.",1206403200,3,7230,5.1339590443686

28901,5,0767802799,"We often forget that long before THE DEPARTED,THE AVIATOR and GANGS OF NEW YORK, director Martin Scorsese and the same crew made a sumptuous and beautifully intoxicating THE AGE OF INNOCENCE in 1993. This film is so intricate with each little detail that to revisit it from time to time is to savour,marvel and appreciate a true work of art of the highest degree. The story,set in the 1870's about the cutthroat world of New York High Society is not just another period piece costume drama; but rather a look into the makings and trappings of the wealthy elite. As a huge fan of Scorsese's films, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is arguably his most passionate film. WARNING: no one gets killed and there are no guns!...but as Scorsese loves to film about his favorite subject, his beloved New York City, here he draws inspiration from the Edith Wharton novel in order to illustrate the ""other side of the coin"" to the ultra-violent THE GANGS OF NEW YORK. These two films together capture a good look at Scorsese's enigmatic city.

Apart from the repressed love,suppressed sexuality,convention and ridicule that is at the heart of this story (which may bore some to tears), THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is filled with the outstanding cinematography of Michael Ballhaus (THE DEPARTED, GANGS OF NEW YORK,GOODFELLAS,LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST); production design by Dante Ferretti (THE AVIATOR,KUNDUN,TITUS and the upcoming SWEENEY TODD); a soundtrack by Elmer Bernstein (FAR FROM HEAVEN,WILD,WILD WEST,TRADING PLACES); and an Oscar win for costumes by Gabriella Pescucci (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY,ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA,INDOCHINE): and finally, above all, the amazing editing of Thelma Schoonmaker (back to back Oscars for THE AVIATOR and THE DEPARTED).These reasons alone make this film SO worth while from  standpoints other than screenplay.

For acting, the British character actress,Miriam Margolyes, won the BAFTA Award for best actress in the role of Mrs. Mingott. Ms. Margolyes was featured in such films as LADIES IN LAVENDER,MODIGLIANI,BEING BEING JULIA,IMMORTAL BELOVED,REDS and YENTL. This is a woman with a long and distinguished career who you see everywhere,recognize her unmistakable face and bulk, but never know her name.

For people that enjoy production values of a film, this nine time Oscar nominated film is on my TOP FIVE list. The fact that the 100% of those involved in this film all eventually won Oscars for other works shows that this is a film designed by an immensely talented crew.

28904,4,0767802799,"THE AGE OF INNOCENCE seems more like a product of the Merchant-Ivory team rather than Martin Scorsese who recently gave us THE GANGS OF NEW YORK. It's a meticulous, richly detailed, leisurely adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel about a thwarted love affair between a man who is engaged to a beautiful young girl (Winona Ryder) and his yearning for her more worldly cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer). It's a yen that can't be dismissed lightly--in fact, it's a love that haunts him all of his life as he pretends to be a loyal husband with nothing more on his mind than fitting in with upper-class New York society.

He reaches the end of the story, imprisoned by society and never able to spend time with the woman he really loves. Slow pacing hurts the narrative (as does the use of a narration by Joanne Woodward which is offsetting more than anything else). A more genteel narrator would have suited the voiceover for this one.

As the troubled hero, Daniel Day-Lewis is the focal point of the entire story and gives an admirable performance, particularly touching in the final scene with his son. Ryder does fairly well with a less complex role but never seems much more than a naive and rather shallow young woman until a revelation about her that comes toward the finale. Michelle Pfeiffer is striking but never seems to fit comfortably into the period scene--she seems too modern even though she's playing an independent soul here.

Surprising to see Alexis Smith in such a small supporting role, looking a bit frail in what must have been one of her last appearances. As for director Scorsese, this is a far cry from his gangster element but he does a superb job of recreating an age of elegance and manners among the idle rich in the New York society of the 1870s.",1185580800,,1767,4.657051282051282
28905,4,0767802799,"This is about a romance that is never consummated. In fact, it is about a romance that smolders but never burns. It is about a potential love affair that is totally undone by New York's upper society before it can really begin. It is the story of two female cousins, young innocent May Welland (played by wide-eyed fresh-faced Winona Ryder) and sophisticated beautiful Countess Ellen Olenska (played with the sadness required by Michelle Pfeiffer).  Between these two women is the young attorney, Newland Archer, a man who thinks of himself as bright and sophisticated but finds himself out-maneuvered by the social forces in which he lives.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays this role well, arrogant and yet compassionate, intelligent and yet vulnerable to forces beyond his control.

The film could be described as ravishing with the incredible beauty of the interiors of New York's wealthiest citizens, the amazing dresses and jewels worn by the women in the 1870s, the vast gardens and flowers, and the rare feasts of culinary delights. However, the romance is anything but ravishing. It is a painful protracted long suffering ordeal that has such amazing acts of intimacy as Archer kissing the slipper of Countess Olenska in one scene and taking off her glove in a carriage so that he might kiss her wrist in another scene. Oh my! Such scandal! By our current morals and standards of sexual behavior, this unconsummated romance is frustrating to the extreme.

Martin Scorsese, the director, paints a world of vast luxery and beauty in the society yet under the veneer, it is a highly controlled and monitored group. Interestingly enough it is both the men and the women in this society who work to maintain strict social norms and create tight borders around who is and is not in their society.  Almost all the characters, including May's mother (played by Geraldine Chaplin) and Newland's mother (played by Sian Phillips - that wonderful actress who plays Empress Livia in the I, Claudius series), help maintain this tight controlled social world of manners and morals, that can become a prison for those who may wish to break the rules.

The crux of the film is that a young man, engaged to marry the right girl for him, a beautiful rich socialite, becomes more and more interested in her worldly sophisticated experienced cousin. He acts with extreme kindness which wins the heart of Countess Olenska, but to hurt those around him to follow a romance with the Countess would lower him in her eyes and she resists the romance, in major part because of the consequences to her younger cousin and to Newland. He is also a character pulled apart by the restrictions of society and his desires for Ellen. As they inch closer to beginning an affair, society comes to the rescue and divides them forever. It is the strategic moves of his wife, May, that really close the deal for she manipulates both Newland and Ellen to back away from each other with her carefully played role of the potential innocent victim. As narrator Joanne Woodward relates, all New York Society rallys and supports May and works to retain the marriage while separating Ellen and Newland.  After she leaves for Paris he never sees her again.

What do modern audiences make of such a situation as created by Edith Wharton in the 1920's?  It all boils down to whether your choices in life are dictated primarily by your own moral compass or by the moral compass of society. There are costs to each. Gay men have selected to marry women due to the pressure of our culture and society for years. We know the price of society's norms. And yet, we know that those who follow only their own moral compass can create great pain and chaos in the lives of those around them as well as for themselves. Newland Archer chooses to live in a gilded cage, to seek happiness from family life, but to always feel somewhat cheated that his one true sexual passionate love never became a reality.",1184457600,4,3942,4.793814432989691

28907,5,0767802799,"I firmly believe that this is the greatest film ever made; it is surely the greatest I have ever seen, and over several decades I've seen many.  It's one of the most powerful works of art I've experienced in any form.

I can still recall vividly the first time that I saw it. It was at a matinee viewing at a theater in downtown Philadelphia. The audience was me, my then-wife, and about a gazillion sweet little old ladies, median age of about 73.  The audience observed stone silence throughout the showing; not a whisper, not a popcorn-rustle.  I (and I suspect several other people) left the theater with new appreciation of the emotional power of film.

What makes this film so uniquely powerful is that it so perfectly depicts that most powerful of emotions: love.  I tend to be an impatient critic of most romantic films, which I find manipulative and unbelievable.  I can't believe in a film romance simply because violins well up when two attractive people look at each other.  But this film, unlike any other I know of, vividly documents the experience of falling in love: the way that the mind seizes upon the words and the gestures of one woman alone, finding something unique, intriguing, soul-piercing in them, and filtering out everyone else.

The basic story is that of Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), a young pillar of upper-crust 1870s New York society.  He has a non-conformist's mind, but is outwardly respectful of the culture in which he lives.  About the time that he becomes engaged to May (Wynona Ryder), there arrives in his world the Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer.)  The Countess is fleeing a marriage and maltreatment from Count Olenski, from whom she wants that then-scandalous thing:  divorce.  The Countess herself is the subject of rumors of improprieties with her husband's secretary.

Thus, as Newland and the Countess find something unique in one another and fall in love, it presents Newland with an agonizing dilemma: is there any honorable way to be with the potential love of his life, given his engagement to May, and Olenska's marriage to the Count?  But it would be a crime against art to spoil that mystery for you, so enough said.

One remarkable aspect of this film is that the characters' society not only constrains the conduct of everyone involved, but also the expressions of their feelings.  Daniel Day Lewis in particular carries a burden of conveying the most powerful emotions without being able to voice them.  He does this in one of the most magnificent performances ever on film, often acting wordlessly through means as subtle as trembling fingers or a clenched jaw.

You are shown quite clearly how he falls in love with the Countess.  She gives voice to the irreverent thoughts that never occur to May, and which Newland feels but would never speak. The looks of shocked amusement on Daniel Day Lewis's face in many of these early conversations are a vital part of the gradual, but irresistible, warming of their early relationship.

What unfolds is a story of love, and heartbreak, of choices made, of responsibilities met, and of opportunities missed and gone forever.  It's a tale that will affect anyone who ever wonders about the path not taken in their own life.  And it's also a tale of the clash between societal norms and individual desires, especially limiting the options of an unlucky woman.

Upon first viewing, the visual genius of the film is very striking.  Stills of the film rival the great paintings of art history (and in at least one instance, nearly parodying a famous Seurat.)  There's tremendous visual splendor and opulence.

I found that on repeat viewings, however, I was equally amazed by the film's dynamic qualities - the way that one scene draws you into the next, often with the beautiful orchestral score as an ineluctable link between scenes.  The sequence in which the yellow roses are ordered and delivered is a gorgeous montage of a few seconds, driven by the backing music.

Oh, and that music - Elmer Bernstein composed one of the most emotive scores ever for a film, and several of the scenes draw their power from it. Though the score is very reminiscent of the third movement of the Brahms third symphony, it may actually exceed the Brahms in several places for emotional power.

It's a film that one watches and repeatedly has the feeling, ""This is one of the great scenes in all of film.""  But those fantastic scenes just keep coming, one after the other.  I have particular favorites:  the scene where the Countess whispers to Newland in the opera box, the scene where he approaches her as she looks out at the lighthouse, and of course, the incredibly moving final scene.

I don't know what else to say about the final scene other than that watching it for the first time was a more powerful experience than I'd had at the cinema at any time prior.

Strangely, this is one of the lesser-known Scorsese films.  I'm a great fan of Scorsese's other works, but he certainly never made a gangster film as great as this.  I suspect that this one just didn't find its natural audience.  Perhaps people expected it to be a lighter romantic costume drama.  Instead it is an intense story of romantic agony, told from the viewpoint of a conflicted male.  Perhaps it reflects that male perspective too much to be a chick flick, whereas not enough men were interested in watching this story.  Perhaps it was just too subtle.  Whatever the cause, the lack of appreciation is unfortunate, because it's a story that should have great power for everyone who has ever been deeply and truly in love, especially if that love might slip away forever.

I saw this film repeatedly after it was first released, but several years had passed before I saw it again this past weekend with my wife.  It's like Daniel Day Lewis says to Michelle Pfeiffer late in the film:  ""Every time I see you, you happen to me all over again.""  And so it is with this masterpiece.",1179100800,8,5951,4.749756572541383
28908,4,0767802799,"With  stunning period costumes, lavish interiors and lush outdoor scenes Scorsese's THE AGE OF INNOCENCE has to be one of the most beautiful movies ever filmed.  The movie stays remarkably faithful to Edith Wharton's 1920 novel in part because Joanne Woodward provides convincing voice over narration often using Wharton's exact words.  The narration also clues the viewers in to the customs and hypocrisies of old New York which play such an important part in the plot.  The major flaw in the film is the grand love between ""The Countess"" Ellen (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) seemed unconvincing to this viewer.  Although Pfeiffer is very beautiful in the film she does not seem particularly intelligent, free thinking or independent which are the qualities that supposedly attract Day-Lewis's character. Day-Lewis is adequate in his part though I really could not see him as the great love of Pfeiffer's Ellen's life either.  It is Winona Ryder as the sweet seeming but astute and determined May who really takes the acting prize.  The rest of the film is very well cast and this is an excellent film for those who love historical dramas and faithful film adaptations of great books.",1178928000,5,1204,5.081218274111675

Whether this is the fault of Caiman or Amazon I really couldn't say, but I feel like this ad needs to make it MUCH clearer that this is a German version.

Like I say, I've seen this film a million times so I wasn't spending a whole lot of time scanning every single detail -- I was just quickly shopping for the best price on a DVD of The Age of Innocence!

My 12-yr. old son had the great idea (in the face of my terrible disappointment) to just go ahead and play it, since it probably had an option (like most DVDs) for playing the disk in its original English. I was all excited about this, until the FURTHER blow that the disk is unplayable on standard American DVD players!! I mean, c'mon!!

Yes, once again, if you look carefully the ad DOES indicate this, but I just feel that the whole thing is ridiculous! This is such a HIGHLY SPECIALIZED item, for a such a very specific group of people, that it should NOT be listed right along with all the standard, original versions of The Age of Innocence.

If you do, it will begin to open up new vistas for you about this movie and the period in which it takes place.  Daniel Day-Lewis once again makes this film.  You feel his intense pain once he unfortunately falls in love with the ""wrong woman"" (Pfeiffer) after being engaged to the ""right woman"" (Ryder).  He is a true gentleman in every sense of the word and you mourn for him throughout this film.  Due to circumstances beyond his control, he is thrown together with the wrong woman at the very time he has been pushing to move the date up for his marriage to the right woman. There is a palpable, underlying  eroticism and sensuality that is very well developed by Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer even though they never really have an affair.

Both Brokeback Mountain and The Age of Innocence deal with the struggles that people make to break free from society's suffocating grasp, and in both cases true love is turned away in exchange for societal acceptance. Yet, The Age of Innocence doesn't resort to the cop-out that Brokeback Mountain does (*spoilers*: Jack Twist being martyred). Rather, The Age of Innocence offers a much more painful outcome: living the rest of your life knowing that the one person you love is within reach, but choosing to remember her as she was and living out your life in solitude.

The bottom line theme is that this is a story of a forbidden love of sorts, suppressed by the propriety of the society they live in and the circumstance that finds the parties married to other people. What happens when you find your ""true love"" and it is not the person you are married to...in 1870s NYC...whoops. In modern times, you just get divorced I guess. But at the time, in those social circles, divorce was a taboo that would lead to being ostracized from all the hip parties (and possibly your family). Why that would be a hindrance to ""true love"" I don't know, but it was in this movie.

In any event, we get to watch the slow suffering of these estranged lovers over time, but Scorcese never quite hits the emotional vein that makes a tragedy of so long life really captivating to an audience. Unfortunately, Scorcese also takes 2 plus hours to tell us this simple story.

Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic per usual, one of the few bright spots. He really captured the essence of a ""proper"" man suffering greatly just underneath the surface. Michelle Pfeiffer is also good in her role, which Scorcese must have picked her for after a similar role in Dangerous Liaisons (a far superior movie).

Countess Olenska has fled from her European husband into the stuffy society of upper crust New York; Archer falls madly in love with her. Archer never allows the propriety of his social customs to falter and never allows his passions for the Countess to surface.

Scorsese collected a great cast from both sides of the ocean.

Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis) is a successful business man who is constrained by the ethics of the time.  He is engaged to socially proper lady, May (Winona Ryder).  But Newland wants some excitement in his life.

Enter May's cousin, the Countess Olenska (Michele Pfeiffer).  Ellen has run away from an abusive marriage.  Ellen is everything May is not.  The only problem is because of this, she is a social outcast.

Newland goes ahead with his marriage but keeps close ties with Ellen.  Ellen loves Newland but knows that she can never have him for two reasons.  The first is she could never hurt May.  And second, her husband will never give her a divorce.

Newland and Ellen do have an affair but in the end the social pressures force Newland back to his wife and family.  And Ellen is forced to return to her husband.  Many people will not be happy with the ending but for the time that the book takes place and when the book is written, this is the only true option.

This was a definite departure for Scorsese, other than taking place in New York City, but it is a complete success.  Daniel Day Lewis once again proves that he can handle any role and time period.  Michele Pfeiffer shows her ability to be alluring yet very stays in the period.  Winona Ryder has perfected her role as a repressed woman.  The supporting cast is filled with many exceptional actors but the best is Miriam Marogoyles as Mrs. Mingott, the society matron who is just excessive in every way.

If you enjoy period pieces or would like a probably excellent depiction of NY society at the turn of the century (19th), you will enjoy this film.

This is very different from what Scorsese is known for doing, makes me wonder if the movie would've been better received if it was not directed by him. This is truly an underrated movie.

The movie centers around three characters who are either trapped by the hypocrisy and conventionalism of the period of time they unfortunately lived in (Ellen Olenska and Newland Archer) or chose to adapt to that kind of society and blend with the conventions (May Welland). The relationships of the three characters provide the backbone for the story while laying out some insights to a society where being different is considered a major sin.

Daniel Day Lewis in one of his least showy roles (at least compared to My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father, and The Crucible) was as always superb. He seemed a little detached from the character in the beginning of the movie but as the movie progresses towards the middle, he was quietly passionate and commanding. Michelle Pfeiffer, even though not exactly the first actress that comes to mind to play Ellen Olenska, was also superb. The tragic love affair between Newland and Ellen was powerful because of Day Lewis and Pfeiffer's passionate performances. Winona Ryder shows again why she is one the most exciting actresses of her generation (well at least at her popularity's peak) as she beautifully play the seemingly innocent May that was very instrumental to the effectiveness of the ending.

The ending was perfect. I consider this to be one of the best movie endings together with Casablanca, Seven, Chinatown, Bonnie and Clyde, Thelma and Louise, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to name a few. The ""big revelation"" about"" May Welland, the potential reunion of Newland and Ellen, the quick flashback, and Newland walking away. Everything about it was perfect.

28931,4,0767802799,"In the year 1993 Martin Scorsese surprised everyone by reining his directorship to Edith Wharton's most enduringly popular novel set in the Golden Age(1870s) of New York society. He is the most renowned and controversial director of his time specialising in theme of violent turmoil(guilt, desire,passion) which is commonly found in people.

Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis), an upstanding gentleman and partner in a rewarding law firm, is engaged to the perfect society woman, the pretty and polished May Welland (Winona Ryder). Newland's world changes when he meets Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), May's beautiful,intelligent and 'different' cousin who has resided in Europe and going thru a divorce. Her liberal sensibility starts falling for Newland's fervent spirit.

Not a word of rigid social code is written down anywhere which governs how these people should talk, walk, meet, part, dine, work, love, and marry. But these people have been studying it since they were born. Here it is where Newland and Olenska dare to differ and hence begins a submissive tiff between the individual and the community. Newland has to make a painful choice between a passionate life with Olenska and a safe life with May--the life he was born and raised to lead.

We're guided on this voyage by narrator (Joanne Woodward), who understands all that is happening and makes it captivating by supplying at times the private thoughts of some of the characters.

Without a literal bloodshed the film offers meticulously designed costumes and settings that evoke a culture as classy in its surface as it is conflicting in its customs. Ryder and Pfeiffer glow in their respective acts, but it is Daniel's restrained performance that is a real turn-on, particularly his scenes with both the leading ladies and the last scence are to watch out for.

Over a decade old but the film leaves you thinking with a lump in the throat. Perhaps violence attains a new meaning here that Scorcese calls his ""most violent film"".",1122508800,7,2010,5.134556574923548
28932,3,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese and his team have faithfully captured the atmosphere of Edith Wharton's magnificent novel, and most of the actors are up to the task.  The production design and music are particularly splendid.  But Michelle Pfeiffer is all wrong for the role of Ellen Olenska.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say she ruins the movie.  She's the wrong physical type, the wrong emotional type.

Ellen is supposed to be a mysterious, exotic woman -- ""different,"" as Newland Archer puts it.  But Pfeiffer is anything but different.  She's too all-American, too garden-variety-pretty, too much the cheerleader type.  It's not that she doesn't have acting chops in general -- she's normally an excellent actress -- but she doesn't have what it takes to carry off this role.  She even resorts to a kind of kooky, indefinable, faux-foreign accent at times, to signal, I suppose, that Ellen has been living in Europe for years.  She's just all wrong.  That's why I give this otherwise spectacular film only 3 stars.  Imagine what a more appropriate actress could have done with this role!  Smoldered right through the screen.

Anyway, you can always read the book, which is easily 5 stars and then some.",1120262400,9,1192,4.865671641791045
28933,5,0767802799,"I was a big Wharton fan, and read all her work several years ago.  THE AGE OF INNOCENCE I've read at least three times completely.  And I have a feeling that Wharton would have been a fan of this adaptation.  Scorsese found the book's atmosphere, characters, and the sheer narrative grace of Wharton's sad tale of destiny in old New York.  As the last scene unfolded, I almost had a sense of deja vu, that the setting in the Parisian courtyard was exactly capturing the final moment of Archer's recognition of his fate.  It was so touching.

What a production!  The soundtrack, the cinematography, the costumes, the editing and narrative flow--masterful and amazing.  I've seen the movie a few times now, and find more to admire with each viewing.  I did notice that the painting, the Bouguereau ""The Return of Spring"" that hung in the Beaufort's home in the 1870's, is actually supposed to be from 1886, but I think Wharton got that wrong in her novel...And why couldn't Daniel Day-Lewis manage an actual kiss at some point...he nibbled like a rabbit.

But there are few who dared to determine it and make their own destiny, thus a story of love revolution or so called betrayal is told.
This is an immensely sentimental film casting some of the best character-portraying screen performers at that time. The younger Daniel Day-Lewis with masculine jaw lines and features is the clear choice for the perfectly chivalrous yet fragile aristocrat gentleman Newland Archer. His instant choice of wife, the forever decently sweet and optimistic May Welland is played by no one else but the well known innocent ageless princess-like Winona Ryder. While May's bold, flirtatious cousin Countess Olenska is forbidden siren Michelle Pfeiffer, blonde with every curl desirable.

oft-tread mileu, the mean streets of present-day New York, for a period and setting that some have speculated would be more appropriate subject matter for a Merchant-Ivory film.
But New York is New York and Mr. Scorsese seems as mesmerized by the New York of the 19th Century as he is by the New York of the 20th.  Edith Wharton's dry, satiric prose is given an erotic bloom, bursting blossoms and vivid colors splashing across the
screen with an energetic immediacy that Mr. Scorsese usually reserves for graphic bloodletting.  The struggle of Newland Archer, as played by Daniel Day-Lewis, between a boundless liberalism and the strict, repressive society around him is present in this fine actor's every gesture.  To contrast his performance here with his wild, ferocious work in Scorsese's GANGS OF NEW YORK is to bear witness to an almost absurd level of versatility.  Winona Ryder is somewhat miscast but conveys ample complexity.  It is Michelle Pfeiffer's radiant performance that sets the picture ablaze, though.  You want to drown in her eyes, even as the world is crushing her with every spin.",1073174400,5,1163,5.0
28939,5,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Edith Wharton's exquisite tragedy of manners ""The Age of Innocence"" is a lush, meticulously staged, heartbreakingly gorgeous but hideously painful experience to watch: it is a tale of two young people, lured away from societal restraint and social decency by Passion, ensaring themselves in a Death Trap, one that will claim their lives, reputations, and souls.
Watching ""The Age of Innocence"" is like watching some glorious rare bird, entrapped in a gilded, gem-studded cage, fight its way to freedom---even though the bars of the cage bristle with diamond shards and daggers. We know the bird is doomed; we know the wages of Passion is Death. We watch anyway, transfixed.
Published in the 1920's, Edith Wharton's ""Age of Innocence"" was a scrupulous study of a society that had already been obliterated by a rapidly changing, far less 'innocent' continental Republic. In the novel and the movie, we are ensconced in unspoken yet binding social contrivances of New York of the 1870's, and quickly introduced to a bizarre menage a trois of striking characters: Newland Archer (played to the nuanced, agonized hilt by Daniel Day Lewis), a young and bold attorney, comfortably settled in New York society yet not a leading light; May Welland (played all sweetness and light---and cunning---by an effective Winona Ryder), born into a solid family, a blithe spirit projecting innocence, and Newland's fiancee; and the Countess Ellen Olenska (played by Michelle Pfeifer, in a role tailor-made for her), May's cousin, a New Yorker ensnared in a marriage of convenience to a disreputable European count of dissolute habits and degenerate nature.
Archer, initially suspicious and disapproving of the unconvential and slightly disreputable Countess Olenska, succumbs quickly to her charms and is smitten; passion unfolds; disaster, precictably, follows.
This intricately crafted, meticulously guilded Age of Innocence is made innocent, of course, by its merciless social strictures, its severe, sere social codes. Scorsese introduces us to this beautiful, fragile, wickedly punishing bell jar of social mores and etiquette, delves deep into its evanescent detail, its galleries of paintings and tapestries, its sitting rooms of studied gentlemen cutting and lighthing their cigars, its panoply of dinner plates and intricately crafted repasts.
""The Age of Innocence"" follows the excruciatingly painful, totally surreptious battle waged between Olenska and her would-be lover Newland Archer versus Decent Society. Scorsese has a deft, steady hand here: the visions of 1870's New York high society are so clear, so rich, so lush, so vibrant that they bring tears to your eyes; kudos should go to Scorcese's faithful German cinematographer Michael Ballhaus (""Goodfellas"", ""Gangs of New York""), who also produced the riveting lushness of Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""---small wonder ""Age of Innocence"" resembles 'Dracula' in atmosphere, richness, and ambience.
But whereas Coppola's bloodsuckers drank the blood of their unwitting prey, Scorsese's vampires feast on the reputation and integrity of their fallen victims. This is a meticulously balanced society in which social regard and worth is measured in thank-you notes and milliseconds; it is an artificial construct, perfectly presented by Scorsese, which is as unbearably, unworkably fragile as it is judgmental.
The acting here is uniformly solid: Daniel Day-Lewis is note-perfect as the conflicted Archer, Pfeifer woefully diplomatic as the frustrated Olenska, Ryder confident in her role as a latter-day Machiavelli on the Hudson, all smiles and naive charm. Backing up the leads is a veritable host of veteran actors, including Richard Grant as the sneering Larry Lefferts, Miriam Margolyes as a shrewd but effusive Mrs. Mingott, the impeccable Stuart Wilson as the mustachio-twirling ""villain"" Julius Beaufort (an engine of destruction for this 'age of innocence'), and a besieged Mary Beth Hurt as Beaufort's long-suffering wife.
As painful as first love, as acute as the death of a beloved friend, ""The Age of Innocence"" is a breathtaking, living, breathing work of art. But the casual viewer, unarmed for its force, should beware: here be Dragons.",1069632000,11,4234,5.52542372881356

28941,5,0767802799,"A lush, period film....overly well-mannered characters...dialogue often not spoken much above a whisper....and this film was directed by Martin Scorsese, director of Goodfellows, the ultimate wiseguys movie about gangsters???? What's going on here??? What would a famed Mafiosi director know about a period comedy set in 1870's New York high society? Well, quite a bit, actually. Reportedly, Scorsese BEGGED for the chance to direct this epic, saying he grew up in a such a society, and understood it better than almost anyone else. The close-knit families, the strict codes of conduct and honor, a highly structured society lorded over by the most elite families; in short, there are many, many similarities between Edith Wharton's New York and Martin Scorsese's Big Apple. Wharton's society mavens use whispers and rumours instead of bullets to leave their heart scars, but the effect is the same: one must conform to this highly structured society or leave it. Daniel Day-Lewis is Newland Archer, the rising young lawyer and member of New York society whose evenings are spent at fancy-dress balls, the opera, and other social events. He marries beautiful but seemingly simple May Welland, played by Winona Ryder, and settles into a life most of us would envy. However, there is just one thing missing from this well-ordered world: passion. That passion comes from Europe one day in the person of the Countess Olenska, a cousin of May's separated from her loveless marriage to an aristocratic husband. There is an immediate attraction between Archer and Olenska, and as he and May seek to redeem her place in society, the two childhood friends begin an affair that, given the time and place and their stations in life, is doomed to fail. Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer are fabulous as the lovers, seeking to keep their encounters hidden from the rest of society. They are really soul-mates more than lovers, Olenska bringing to Archer's life the joire de vive that the always-prim and proper May can never give him. Winona Ryder is an absolute revelation as May. Everytime she comes on screen, the viewer is left to wonder: how much does she know and when does she find out? This high drama unfolds before one of the most sumptuous settings ever captured on film; the art and set decorators reportedly used period paintings to ensure the right look. Scorsese allows the story to unfold at a natural pace, just like reading a relaxing novel, except few novels contain a passion so tightly restrained that the characters are in eminent danger of making their entire world collapse for want of relief. There are plenty of delicious supporting characters as well; Mary Beth Hurt and Stuart Wilson as the Beauforts, another couple who broke this society's taboos and find themselves covered in shame; Michael Gough and Alexis Smith as the van der Luydens, the most influential family in New York, who do not fail to come to the Countess' aid in her time of need; and, best of all, Miriam Margolyes as society doyenne Mrs. Manson Mingott, providing much needed comic relief with her grand, imperious manner and her passel of pooches. Joanne Woodward makes a wonderful narrator to this intriguing world as the action unfolds at a stately pace through time and space (stately, but never boring!), finally climaxing in a Paris street scene that is incredibly moving in it's heartbreaking simplicity. So, if you want a fast-paced action thriller with plenty of explosions, go elsewhere. However, if carefully-paced, unrequited passion is your game, then get The Age of Innocence today. This movie just might leave a few scars on your heart!",1069286400,5,3634,5.028192371475954
28942,5,0767802799,"I actually saw this movie when it was released in 1993, and honestly it was pretty dull then. Of course I was 22, and the workings of that late-1800's New York society really didn't make much sense or have much relevance.
I think the film may have been ignored at its release because of the slew of other ""period pieces"" which were so popular (an eventually common) in the late 80's/early 90's... But watching it again 10 years later, this film is anything but common.
The true intensity is Scorcese's detached presentation of a hypocritical & hateful society which holds its members as prisoners.
Not to mention impeccable art direction & beautiful cinematography by the legendary Michael Ballhaus. The film looks as impressionistic as the paintings that line the walls of the characters' homes.
Scorsese is always acute in his casting decisions, and this is one of the films many virtues:
Lewis is perfect as a man who's struggle between his passion & his duty are constantly on the verge of devouring him (yet somehow he thrives on his torture).
Ryder is the seemingly innocent & naive girl who is completely manipulative & cunning underneath her exterior (gee, who would have thought?!) -- notice the arching scene.
In a sense, this was one of Pfeiffer's defining roles. Pfeiffer herself (in a sense) is an ""outcast"" who has never truly been accepted as a ""serious"" actress by her peers in the acting community. Watching this film again, it amazes me how this role somehow reflects her personal position in the current social structure of Hollywood, similar to her character existing in 1800's New York society.
Wow...
What an amazing pic. I completely ""missed it"" the first time around. Great observance of ""high society."" Many of those codes are strangely applicable today.
Not recommended for those who like fast paced movies, or those who are looking for the ""usual Scorcese."" I would couple this with ""Last Temptation of Christ"" as Scorsese's most brave, artistic, demanding & abstract films to date.",1068854400,20,2009,4.946745562130178

Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a young barrister who is engaged to Meg Welland (Wynonna Ryder) but ends up lusting after her cousin, Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfieffer) instead.  Director, Martin Scorsese paces the film like Warton's book, slowly, methodically but with an attention to details that is as captivating as it is compelling to watch.  No one wants to see the countess divorced though everyone is hoping that she will break apart Newland's marriage so that the scandal of it all will make for interesting dinner conversations and parlour speculation.  This is grand entertainment, told with a masterful hand and celebrated with great depth of emotion and character.
Columbia's transfer of the film is an adequate attempt, though there is excessive loss of fine detail in many of the scenes due to overuse of noise reduction video equipment.

The most amazing thing to me, at the time and since, was the performance by W. Ryder, who, up until this film, left me annoyed or bored. In this movie, she displays a shredness and depth that left me stunned. At first she seems just another upper class dolt, following the social dictates of the time and participating in a partly arranged marriage.

28947,5,0767802799,"It seems that all of these reviews are focusing on the fact that this movie is so different from what we expect from Martin Scorsese, which it is.  Outside of some signature tricks, there is nothing that one could identify as Scorsesian in this movie.  But that is entirely irrelevant; what matters is the quality of the film, not the people who make it, and this is a brilliant movie.  This is a rich subtlety to the whole movie, a silent beauty which is felt rather than seen.  Besides a great directing turn by Scorsese (who was nominated by the Directors' Guild for best director on this movie; an award which is often the truest representation of a great director), there is also a wonderful performance from the acting ensemble.  Much like Scorsese, Daniel Day-Lewis gives a far more subtle performance than we are used to, which probably explains why people tend to disregard this performance when it is put alongside his work in ""My Left Foot"" and ""In the Name of the Father.""  It may have even been worthy of an Oscar nomination, except that the Academy refuses to nominate an actor twice in the same category (in the same year ""The Age of Innocence was released, he was already nominated for Best Actor in ""In the Name of the Father,"" which is a more stunning and Oscar-friendly role).  Winona Ryder did receive a well earned nomination for Best Supporting Actress, playing the role of an (apparently) naive wife.  Even Michelle Pfeiffer (of whom I am not a particular fan) more than pulls off the role of Countess Ellen Olenska.
This is a film which in many years would have earned a fair number of Oscar nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director), but was the odd-film-out in a strong year of cinema (1993 featured ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Piano,"" ""In the Name of the Father,"" and ""Philadelphia,"" to name a few).  It is unfortunate that movies are given recognition on a year-to-year basis, so that in a strong year there will be a few unfortunate snubs (and likewise in a weak year an undeserving movie will come up big).  ""The Age of Innocence"" is a beautifully done film, one that strikes at the soul with its subtle grace and beauty; a truly poignant film.  I was quite sceptical when I bought it; in all honesty, my tastes tend more towards ""The Godfather"" and ""Five Easy Pieces,"" but my gamble was well rewarded.

28948,3,0767802799,"I read the book The Age of Innocence and enjoyed it, though I felt the romance around which the action revolved was difficult to comprehend.  The over all development of the theme in the book, however, was far more complete than that in the film.
The action of the movie seemed almost stream of consciousness, although from whose perspective was somewhat difficult to say.  It was if Scorcese expected the viewer to be familiar enough with the book to fill in the blanks.  The characters' speech and mannerisms were studied and slow, as though they lived in so rarefied an atmosphere, that they were too delicate to withstand a normal everyday pace to life.  (Maybe that's my own generation speaking however; we certainly live in a sped up world today.  It's as though we are living at 78 rpms and they were at 45, to use old turn table terms).  The splendor and pageantry of the upper class of the age was enjoyable, and the cinematography that highlighted the lifestyle was incredible.  The dinner sequences with the multitudes of courses, each carefully and artfully arranged for the guests was very impressive.  The period gowns were exquisite.  I was speechless over the tableau of famous artists displayed on the walls of the homes of the characters, paintings or replicas of works in the style of Renoir, Van Gogh, Monet, Singer Seargent, and classical types by earlier painters.  I was especially impressed to see the incredible ""Dual after the Ball"" by Jean Gerome hanging over a settee in one of the homes.  It's one of my favorite paintings.
Again, as in the book, the romance seemed tepid.  The illicit lovers were hardly alone together enough to have gotten past social pleasantries when they are expressing enduring passion.  This is true of the book too, but in the book there is a certain sense of the ridiculous, a sense of two self centered people enjoying tormenting themselves over a relationship they couldn't have.  From the book one comes away with a sense that a young man with everything to lose was kept on the straight and narrow by conniving relatives who have his best interests at heart, like an Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw manner play.  The Scorsese film has more of the feel of Ibsen, parted lovers doomed to plodding through life without one another, mere spectators to the drama of other people's lives.

To begin with, the plot might justify a brief hour and a half to 2 hour film, but nothing like this  15 hour (feels like it, really) snooze-fest.  It's very simple, and has been done thousands of times much better.  Two people fall in love but for some reason they can't get together or they wouldn't still be in love if they did (I only saw it two weeks ago and already I can't remember).  Then there is the dialogue, which is mostly schmaltzy and overly melodramatic, and is completely mangled by most of the actors.  Especially annoying is Joanne Woodwards voice-over narration, which chirps up whenever the music swells to tell you a) what just happened (which you know if you've been paying attention at all) b) what everyone's thinking about (which you know because most of the performances are so cartoonish) and c) what the fallout will be (which you don't need to know because they'll show you the scene about it later).  Daniel Day-Lewis looks grumpy most of the time, whereas Michelle Pfeiffer is suitably radiant, but says most of her lines in a breathless whisper with her eyes unfocused, gazing dreamily at the wall.  In the supporting cast, Scorcese has a miniature stable of British actors in near-cameos.  Unlike their American counterparts, they look comfortable and relaxed doing a period peice, but the dialect coach seems to have them all doing ridiculously exagerrated American accents.  Basically, had the Brits made this movie, it might have been a lot better, because they do enough costume dramas to know not to get caught up lingering on the pretty sets.  So I'm giving the film one star for itself, and one for Winona Ryder, as the only cast member who doesn't look like a rank amateur, despite being the youngest person there.",1023062400,7,1795,4.776699029126213

This film is truly a feast for the eyes, creating a visual world that perfectly reveals the society in which it is set. More importantly, the screenplay draws us into a world where emotion and its expression are defined by the rules of class. Subtlety and depth are keywords for the story in this film, and the actors compliment the presentation by giving well rounded, natural, and believable performances. Not really a film about romance, it is better to define this as a story of the outside pressures and expectations of those around the main characters (Newland Archer played by Daniel Day-Lewis, and Countess Ellen Olenska played by Michelle Pfeiffer). Their affair, denied to them by their friends and relatives, is a catalyst for our glimpse into opportunities lost, and life long bitter-sweet memories made.

Yet even without Pesci, DeNiro, or foul language, 'The Age of Innocence,' at it's core is quintessential Scorsese.  The key thematic is power, it's related hierarchy and about those who wield and fall to it - only this time instead of exercising power through gunplay and violence it is dispensed through mannerism and whispered subterfuge.  Scenes with Mrs. Mingott interacting with her friends and family come off reminiscent of Paul Sorvino's character in 'Goodfellas.'  All of Scorsese's visual trademarks are also intact with some great tracking shots and loads of loads of rich mise-en-scene.  There's so much visual eye candy to take in, in terms of production and art design that multiple viewings are a must.

28959,5,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese is a genius. Even his worst films are far superior than almost everyone else's and The Age of Innocence is definitely one of his best. He brilliantly captures the spirit of Edith Wharton's novel without ever falling into melodrama and creates a claustrophobic society preordained by an endless set of rules, a world of seething passions beneath a calm and decorous surface where rebellion of any sort is inconceivable, social and familial considerations are paramount and a veneer of respectability must be maintained at all costs. This is a story about human passions clashing with the artificial rules imposed by society and the characters move in an environment so fragile that ""it could be shattered by a whisper"".
Martin Scorsese's direction recreates the affluent and extremely oppressive atmosphere of 19th century New York society in remarkable detail. A subtle and perceptive script, brilliant performances by Michelle Pfeiffer, Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder and the rest of the cast (Richard E. Grant, Mary Beth Hurt, Alec McCowen and the excellent Miriam Margolyes are especially good), and fabulous costumes and production design contribute to make this extraordinary film one of the best of its genre.

28962,5,0767802799,"If it takes a well-made film to remind us of the neglected jewels in our culture's literary showcase, then let it be a work that does honor not only its source, but also its own medium.  ""The Age of Innocence"" is such a film.
The luxury of a novel is that it can be experienced in stages -- picked up and put down as time permits.  A motion picture must capture us, enrapture us and return us to earth in time for the next meal.  Thus, many of the subtleties of character that the novel has time to explore must, in the film, be inferred.  Scenes that are free to languish interminably within the novel must often be omitted within the motion picture for the sake of economy.  Their lessons elided must be ignored or transmitted in another fashion.  The limitation that time places on the film has led some to perceive it as innately inferior to the novel.  With this kind of defective logic we might conclude that the sonnet is an inferior literary form.  It cannot be of worth without physical length and breadth.  Hogwash!  The length and breadth of any artform are measured in the breadth and depth of thought the work provokes.  Or, as Raymond Chandler once wrote: ""There are no viable and significant forms of art.  There is only art, and precious little of that.""
The challenge of the motion picture, when trying to translate the novel into a cinematic experience, is to stay true to the souls of the characters in the book.  By doing so, whatever is lost in in the process of distillation, truth remains.  Martin Scorsese proves himself full worthy of Edith Wharton's vision and in so doing, proves her worthy of his vision as well.
Exquisite! -- and at last on DVD!  Get the DVD!  Perfect casting, with Daniel Day-Lewis as Newland Archer, a New York socialite in the late 1800s torn between the social demands to marry for position and the inner burning for the love of a kindred spirit.  Michelle Pfeiffer is the Countess Olenska, a refugee from a scandalous marriage whose imperviousness to and freedom from the demands and disdains of the social class kindles Newland's passion.
Winona Ryder is absolutely radiant as Newland's fiance, May Welland.  She is the winning image of everything that is style and grace but has no ability to perceive the dimensions of Archer's inner world -- his artistic world.  It is to Miss Ryder's credit that she plays her character as totally oblivious to her own intellectual vacuity.  She is in every other aspect of her character and personality, a person to die for.  A thousand other actors and directors would have allowed her single flaw to have negatively colored their entire rendering.  Yet it is her otherwise flawless character that sustains the tension as Newland Archer must decide between these two beautiful women, with each plausible choice bearing its own compromise with imperfection.
Thank you, Mister Scorsese!  You have honored yourself and us.  From the lush production design by Dante Ferretti to the cinematography by Michael Ballhaus to the bridge narration of Joanne Woodward, there is not a false note here.  For those who feel that two hours and eighteen minutes is ""too long"" to sit still, let me refer you to the movie ""Amadeus,"" where the king is convinced that Mozart's work is too complex -- full of ""too many notes.""  Mozart smugly acquiesces to the king, agreeing to take out the offending notes if only told which must go.  ""The Age of Innocence"" is the perfect length -- just enough notes to tell the story and still remain true to the art of the film.  If someone wishes less, I would refer them to the Cliff's Notes.",1009411200,8,3600,4.680445151033386
28963,4,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Edith Wharton's greatest novel remains, despite its flaws, one of the most spectacular American literary adaptations ever filmed. Scorsese's fascination with the manners and mores of small inward-looking societies lent itself perfectly to this study, Wharton's most thorough study into the anthropology of Old New York: her fetishistic desctiptions of the porcelain table settings, home furnishings, and dress of the most elite members of the Manhattan aristocracy of the 1870s are fully realized in Scorsese's loving adaptation. There are sequences--in particular, the Beauforts' annual opera (stunningly orchestrated to Strauss's ""Radetszky march"" and ""Kaiserwalz""), the two great dinner parties at the van der Luydens' and the Archers', and, most of all, the breathtaking archery contest at Newport--that are as classic as anything Scorsese ever filmed.
Where Scorses seems to stumble, however, is with the acting of the film's central characters. Daniel Day-Lewis does a fine job of conveying newland Archer's neuroses and hesitations, but can't seem to bring off the dash the role requires: the awkward hats of the time don't suit him at all, and make him look as if he were once again playing Forster's Cecil Vyse. Michelle Pfeiffer, whom one might think was ideally suited to play the Countess Olenska, is often quite suitably enchanting in her beautiful Second Empire gowns, but also begins to exhibit the range of tics and mannerisms that marred so many of her performances after this time. (You can really see this in her ""actressy"" reading in a sledge of the telegram she sends Newland from Rhinebeck.) Fortunately, they're both offset by the stellar performance of Winona Ryder as May Welland: Scorsese gets her for once to underplay, and emphasizes her awkwardness in such a way as to make her character seem believably undesirable to her husband, despite Ryder's great beauty. (There's a breathtaking scene while she reads a telegraph to Newland from St. Augustine that conveys this superbly: as Ryder intones, against a hyperlush bank of flowers, her delighted expectations of her upcoming marriage to her fianc&eacute;, Scorsese zooms in on her cavernous mouth as if to show her as an omnivorous monster.) This is Ryder's finest hour as an actress.",1005955200,21,2296,5.327823691460055
28964,5,0767802799,"THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is perhaps the finest piece of filmmaking from director Martin Scorsese. The close attention to details and subtle nuances, the bold, yet sophisticated use of camera movements (the first twenty minutes of the film, at the opera then at the ball is an authentic technical tour-de-force), the precision of camera setups and editing, and the way he incorporates that to reveal the inner, hidden emotion of his protagonists, all that signifies how this master of our contemporary cinema knows his medium, and what he can do with cinema. For instance, just watch the sequence when Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) waits the Countess Olenska at her house, watching the paintings on the wall, the ornaments of that drawing room. Through what he sees and what we touches, with some extremely intelligent use of dissolves and cuts, Scorsese shows who the Countess is and at the same time boldly penetrates into the inner psyche of Archer; what he thinks and what he expects in her, what kind of person he thinks she is and he expects her to be. Then we hear the sound of a carriage arriving, as the camera cuts to a long, full shot of the room as seen through the door from the hall way; visually getting out of his inner mind, and observe him with a distance.

To those who thought Scorsese was just a specialist of gangster movies and violent dramas might have been surprised when he made an adaptation of this novel, a romantic story of unconsumed love set in the late 19th century New York, and would be even more so to know that it was the filmmaker's own choice, his cherished project to adapt this story. But too those who really know Scorsese's works, there's no surprise. Scorsese was always interested more in the inner emotions and inner conflicts of human beings. He is a filmmaker who is constantly interested in, even obsessed with, human conscience, and how that expresses itself in a peculiar social context. To him the visual violence was in a way a tool to express those inner conflicts of his characters; for instance, for Jake La Motta in RAIGING BULL, the fights were always against himself, being beaten was more of a self-punishment than loosing a fight.

Here, Scorsese presents us a drama where there is no apparent physical violence. But in a way, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is the most emotionally violent him he has ever made. The social conventions of the time, constituted of subtle, arbitrary signs, express the hostility of that tribal society which is stronger because you never actually sees it, but nevertheless understand it.

It is a wonderful thing that the film is now finally on DVD, so that we can own it in our home and can see it over and over again, to appreciate its details and understand its depth. However, it is a pity that this DVD is a bare-bone one. Mr. Scorsese must be busy preparing his new film GANGS OF NEW YORK, but we could have waited for him to spare some time to provide an audio commentary. And all the richness of visual details that fills this beautiful but hypocritical and cruel universe, a contemporary audience could have profited from an extended visual supplements to know and understand how close it is historically, and how those paintings, clothing, jewelries, and gestures must have meant in the high-society back then. The transfer of the DVD is not that good either. It is still a decent transfer, I guess, but the richness of colors which really shows these people entrapped in all those superficial beauties are not here. Scorsese and cinematographer Michael Ballhaus deliberately avoided the cinematic convention of using an amber overtone to a period piece, and show the colors straight as they are, and that created a strong narrative in itself. Scorsese has even proclaimed that he would have loved to use the Technicolor die-transfer process for this film. Unfortunately, those striking use of colors is not exactly represented in this DVD edition. Maybe we should wait Criterion to produce an extensive, fully-packed DVD. In waiting, it still is worth to own this one.",1005609600,10,4060,4.797142857142857
28965,5,0767802799,"This 1993 film, directed by Martin Scorsese, brings the Edith Wharton novel to life. Here it is -- all the social comment and smoldering unrequited passions originally intended by the author. And now it's in living color with academy award winning costume design reflecting New York society in the 1870s.
Daniel-Day Lewis is cast as Newland Archer, the upper class young man in conflict between social convention and desire. Michelle Pfieffer plays the Countess Ellen Olenska, who has already defied convention by marrying a European and is further defying convention by leaving her husband and returning to New York. However, in spite of his attraction to the countess, Newland Archer marries the beautiful but seemingly simple May Welland, played by Wynona Ryder, whose outstanding performance won her an academy award nomination.
The film is woven together by the excellent off-screen narration by Joanne Woodward, reading excerpts from the book describing the nuances of social behavior and unspoken thoughts of the characters. The entire package comes across as a small masterpiece. I loved the book, but there is nothing like actually seeing the ballrooms, the gowns, the dinnerware and the food. There is nothing like seeing how very subtle gestures of a glance, a raised eyebrow or a change in tone of voice can have so much meaning. And there is one scene in which Newland Archer struggles with the buttons of the Countess's glove that captures an erotic sensuality in a very special way.
However, a book can be read over many days or weeks. It can be put down and thought about, the characters carried in the mind's eyes for a while. The subtleties and nuances have time to live with the reader. A film, however, must be watched all at once. And watching subtleties and nuances for a full 133 minutes can tend to be a bit boring. But film is film and a book is a book. It is not fair to judge them against each other. So keeping that in mind, I give this video an extremely high recommendation.",1004659200,76,2004,4.845481049562682
28966,5,0767802799,"No wiseguys, no casinos, no boxers, no taxi drivers...but yet it is still New York, this is still a film of man's cruelty to another, and this is still a film by Martin Scorsese.
Villians come in the most beguiling of forms, and in this beautiful film filled with beautiful sets and Oscar-winning costumes, the sinfully innocent face of Winona Ryder is the face of doom for would-be lovers Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pffeifer.  What, no Joe Pesci?  No Harvey Keitel?  Where's Robert De Niro, and more importantly, where are the guns?
Winona Ryder doesn't need any of those usual Scorsese suspects or an automatic to inflict pain, which perhaps makes her the most sinister of all the director's goodfellas.  If you have rebuffed Ryder as just a grown up teen actor, you have obviously never seen this film.  In her Oscar nominated turn, Ryder walks the razor's edge of duality, and you're never quite aware of it until the end.  Clever girl, eh?  My favorite moment?  When she informs husband Day-Lewis about her thoughts on him going on a trip:  ""I'm afraid you can't do that, dear,"" comes the reply with the most lovely smile.
Don't dismiss this film as a love triangle story.  This is just as gritty as any of Martin's films, just with plenty of froufrou (and very well done froufrou at that) to cover it up...isn't that what Victorianism was all about--the Guilded Age?

28968,5,0767802799,"I have seen ""The Age of Innocence"" about 15 times since 1994, and find the  argument as to whether it is boring or not to be fascinating. Period films are not  for everyone, and if you lack an appreciation of subtlety than maybe something  like ""Joe Dirt"" may be better suited for you. But what lies beneath this wonderful  movie is a priceless ode to individuality.
  Michelle Pfeiffer plays Ellen Olenska, a proto-feminist who flees from her failing  European marriage to the home of her blood relatives in 1870's New York  Society. She's been away for most of her life and the States are foreign to her,  but she quickly realizes that she is viewed as threat, a black sheep ---and  Society reacts to her as it would to a dirty black spot on a carpet or on one of  their tuxedo shirts. ""Harmony could be shattered by a whisper"", as well narrated  by Joanne Woodward.
  Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer, an up-and-rising patriarch who sees  something in her that no one else in his rich circle could offer him: an independent  viewpoint to life. As a lawyer and a powerful member of his family, he bravely  tries to protect Ellen from basically everyone, esp. members of their own family.  Despite all of her difficulties, Countess Olenska refuses to part from her  individuality: she smokes in front of Newland, does not hide from men in social  situations, and criticizes her surroundings. Archer doesn't necessarily fall in love  with her as a person but with what she represents: Romanticism and escape.
  There is a lot to love about this film, which is more like a piece of art than a  movie. Every scene and every bit of dialogue denotes elegance and brutality  simultaneously. All of the leading and supporting characters are so believable and  well formed that they trump anything Hollywood has been throwing at us in  recent months. And the setting for this film is very unconventional, at least for the  90's. Through excellent filmmaking, I can see why Society felt the need to  operate in such a ruthless fashion, in order to protect itself from Ellen and what  she represented to Newland, its newly crowned prince.
  Over the past few months, I have also grown an appreciation for Winona  Ryder's performance as May. She is a shrewd politician, who uses her ""bright  blindness"" as a megaphone for Society's rules of conduct, a weapon of  manipulation against her destined husband Newland, and as a way to continue  plotting without easily being detected.
  I wonder how many more times I will watch ""The Age of Innocence"" before I  risk being exposed to Hollywood's 21st century conformity, such as  ""Independence Day"" or ""Wild, Wild West"". All I know is that Ellen Olenska (as  one of my favorite cinematic heroines) serves to validate my own sense of  individuality, and neither she nor the astonishing beauty of this Scorcese creation,  will ever be boring. 10 out of 10 stars.",993427200,5,2900,4.773737373737374

He contemplates leaving his wife, played by a very innocent-seeming Winona Ryder. Ryder, however, manages to be just conniving enough to restrain her husband. She announces she is pregnant just as he announces he plans to travel for an indefinite period of time. The passion between Newland (Day-Lewis) and Olenska is represented well on-screen, and you can feel the sadness and their never seeing one another again after May, Ryder's character, has children.

This was the most visually spectacular and lumonous film of 1993, enhanced by the absolutely phenomenal acting of Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer as the thwarted lovers.

28973,5,0767802799,"THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is perhaps the highest achievement of its director, Martin Scrosese. Those who thought the subject matter (New York high society in the 1870's) does not fit the director's universe doesn't really know neither what Scorsese's films are all about, nor what he is really good at.
This must have been a great challenge for Scorsese; not only that the book (by Edith Wharton) is a truly great one by its own right, but also because everything that really happen in this story does not appear on the surface, but underneath it. Keeping his sharp observing eye on every each detail that constitutes this society, Scorsese re-creates beautifully this universe of beauty and hipocricy, and brings out the emotions that are hidden behind the brilliant gorgeous surface of the society.
There are no visual violence in this film, but in deep, this is probably the most violent and the most painful of all Scorsese film. The emotional pain, the violent intention hidden beneath the code of manners is certainly expressed, for those who are careful and intelligent enough to really see what's going on.
Production designer Dante Feretti (from Fellini and Pasollini movies) joins costumes designer Gabriella Pescucci to do a wonderful job in re-creating the gorgeous atmosphere of New York high society in the 19th century. Scorsese and his cinematographer Michael Ballhaus uses these sets and costumes so that the characters are entrapped surrounded by all those beautiful objects. Within this gold gilded cage of beauty, Daniel Day Lewis, Michelle Pfiefer and Winona Ryder give the best performance of their career; subtle, yet a lot of emotion going on beneath.
In most cases I hate pan-and-scanned VHS editions, don't even bother to buy one. But in the case of this film, which was shot in Super 35mm format, the anamorphic aspect ratio of the theatrical release version was created by masking the top and bottom of the full screen image. Scorsese says he tried so that both framing would work, and it does. The full screen VHS tape will allow you to see more details in sets, costumes and props, and offers you a different enjoyment than the theatrical release version.
I am also looking forward to see a DVD edition of this beautiful film, with a  lot of special features which would allow the audience to have deeper understanding of this obssessively detailed film. Waiting for the DVD edition to be released, I strongly reccomend the book ""The Age of Innocence, a portrait of the film based on the novel by Edith Wharton"" which incorporates the shooting script with photos of paintings and pictures that served as research materials .
For the DVD, Scorsese's and Jay Cocks' commentary is a must. It would be great if some expert scholar of Warton's works would do an additional track as well, pointing out the meanings of the details that modern audience are rather ignorant about.
This film is so rich it would be ideal to own it on tape or even better on DVD, because the you can see it over and over again, each time finding new striking details.",976147200,18,3064,4.858508604206501
28974,5,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese was an unlikely choice indeed to direct this piece, but what a wonderful job he did!  It is a visual masterpiece and very, very true to its time (1870s upper New York).
I still have yet to see the entire movie all in one sitting, but I've seen it in pieces several times.  The opera and formal dinner parties and drawing room tensions are all beautifully filmed, as well as scripted.  I've yet to find the time to read Edith Wharton's novel but the film seems true enough.
A young man, Newland Archer (an exquisite Daniel-Day Lewis) is engaged to a seemingly naive and truly sweet-tempered woman (Winona Ryder).  He is distracted by her lovely cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer).  It seems Newland has been in love with Ellen all along, but held his tongue as she went off to Europe to marry a rich count of Poland.  Now she's back in New York, quietly though assertively calling for a divorce.
She is the bane of society, though everyone is too polite to come out and say it.  Newland pursues a dialogue with Ellen and wants more from her, but Ellen knows what's best for her admirer.  She finally tells him once and for all that she won't have him.  This is of course after he's married May.
May's manipulative qualities don't really surface til the end of the movie, but they are there.  The last thirty or so minutes detail Newland's married life.  We watch his children grow and marry the children of his collegues.  The last character to be introduced is Ted (Robert Sean Leonard), whose role was too small for me (I'm a big fan of RSL).
However, besides the beautiful cinematography, the best thing to explore is polite New York society and how vicious it truly is.  'The Age of Innocence' is one of my favorite movies because of its truth, its dialogue, and its color.",974592000,19,1808,4.560371517027864
28975,3,0767802799,"EDITH WHARTON's wonderful novel is certainly good looking on the screen ,but it is a misfire most of the time,because we simply can't feel anything for those characters. One must salute SCORSESE for trying something different ,but this is simply not his cup of tea. Actors in general are not to blame,especially MICHELE PFEIFFER who tries to inject some vitality to her character. DAY-LEWIS is incredibly stiff and so is RYDER as gorgeous as she is. If you read most of WHARTON's novels, you know most of her men are boring characters except in THE HOUSE OF MIRTH.Fortunally for us, an adaptation of this novel is due soon.",974505600,2,623,4.777777777777778
28976,3,0767802799,"Martin Scorsese's talents shine very clearly in this movie, as it remains, to me anyway, as one of his best films! It's a movied filled with beauty from every aspect: the acting, the directing,the music, the screenplay,and the cinematography. Everything is stunningly perfect in this film. Martin Scorsese is a director of rare talent, and was unrightly over looked for an Oscar nomination for this movie. Luckily the Academy didn't over look Winona Ryder in this movie, as her performance is one of the many reasons to watch this movie, which is based on Edit Wharton's novel of the same title. Michelle Pfeiffer, in my opinion delievers her best performance to date! This is a movie where one doesn't have to be a Scorsese fan to enjoy it. All you have to do is sit down and relax and watch this modern masterpiece.",973209600,,817,4.72027972027972
28977,5,0767802799,"It's hard to know where to begin this review -- the stunning cinematography? The gripping storyline? The mesmerizing acting?  I can't  begin to put into language the amazine job Scorsese did on this film and I  am NOT a Scorsese fan!  Winona Ryder deserved an Oscar for her underplayed  manipulation of her husband, played equally brilliantly by Day-Lewis.  Pfieffer pulls off the tragic heroine superbly and the icing on the cake is  the supporting actors. A must see.",968457600,2,469,4.935897435897436

7789213,5,0767802799,"Down to the rustle of a skirt, glint from a silver fork, or dusty fragrance of a pale rose, every detail of this film captures Edith Wharton's language, irony and -- especially -- yearning.  Daniel Day Lewis does flawless work, and I was even ok with Michelle Pfeiffer, who I usually think seems self-conscious in her acting.  But I love the movie and am grateful to Martin Scorsese for honoring and respecting Wharton's great novel by encasing the crushing anguish in all the exquisite trappings.  I watch it every year, and every year I find more to linger over.",1525219200,,564,4.6767676767676765
7789214,5,0767802799,Daniel Day-Lewis.  Need I say more?  A classic story of love from afar.  It's a beautiful looking film with great performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder as well.  Daniel Day-Lewis shines in this period piece as the long suffering Newland Archer and it appears that he is very comfortable in a film depicting this era.  A lovely movie.,1524182400,,348,4.830508474576271
