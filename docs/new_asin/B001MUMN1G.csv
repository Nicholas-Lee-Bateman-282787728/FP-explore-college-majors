3700491,4,B001MUMN1G,"Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray co-starred togerther in 8 films between 1935 and 1949 but this one is by far the best of the bunch - including the more well known barnyard flick ""The Egg and I"". This is a ""A Class"" production from the clever opening credits of Claudette {Katherine Grant} developing photos in her lab that shows the film's credits to the mud soaked tunnnel sequence climax where she saves Fred's {Ryan} bacon and creditability. Their screen chemistry was never more evident in how they play against each other - the elegant and sophisticated  New York artsy magazine photographer and the rough edged Irish construction/tunnel worker - ""sandhog"" who is more than he seems. Colbert's characther excudes class and abhorns crudity but once she sees Fred without his shirt, while sleeping she sees him in her dreams as ""Superman"" but I won't give that one away !!

Ms. Grant is a talented but highbrow photographer who takes herself very seriously, in one sequence she is sets up to photograph an egg on a chair asking her sister ""Have you ever seen an interesting photo of an egg"" - pretension on steroids !! Given an unwanted assignment to photograph a large tunnnel project under construction {aka the Lincoln Tunnel} she saves Ryan from being accidently crushed and the subsequent sexual attraction both feel for the other will be denied ,denied and denied until fate takes a hand !!!

This is not a subtle comedy and Irish sterotypes and accents abound including several well staged brawls including a very obvious but funny game of musical chairs with knockout punches and bruises galore eliminating players until one battered survivior is left standing. Grant's  work environment is peopled by men who are over-civilized, snarky intellectuals who are MacMurray's physical and personality opposites - Ryan offhandedly responds to one of them {after a sarcastic remark} as ""Ok Doll Face""!!

By plot machinations, MacMurray winds up working for Colbert when a photo she takes of Ryan beating the bejabbers out of 3 sandhogs is accidently published and fighting on the job gets him a 4 month suspension. They spend most of the remainder of the film mightly trying to resist falling for each other. Ryan is aggessively and at times almost obnoxiously chauvanistic in his attitude, language and behavior towards Ms. Grant and in 2014 {obviously} this doesn't play as well as it may have in 1943. One can see the film scenario being a variation of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"".

The outstanding supporting cast includes - Ilka Chase as Colberts wise-cracking sister, {Betty Davis sympathetic cousin in ""Now Voyager""}, Richard Haydn as a ""smarthy pants"" intellectual who ulitimately acts as the good angel to both Grant and Ryan, {He's the busybody snooper from ""Sitting Pretty""} and espisically blonde,leggy June Havoc {Gypsey Rose Lee's sister} as ""Darleen"" a hard edged showgirl with a rancous voice and designs on Ryan . She and Colbert are at loggerheads thru-out - Darleen mockingly refers to Colbert as ""Fluffy Face"" and in an unexpected role reversal she will get her commeruppance !!

There is some biting/clever dialouge and plot twists but the tunnel sequence with Grant and the assorted sandhogs entering the damaged and partially flooded tunnel risking life and limb to retrieve her camera that has the film that will prove that Ryan's brainchild/invention, a machine to prevent major mudslides during the tunnel construction was the highlight of the film.  Colbert gallantly and gamely wading thru,  sliding over and getting covered with gallons of muck is an unusual situation to be in for this most elegant of leading ladies and the sequence is very nicely realized. The best of Paramount top ""behind the scenes"" talent was mobilized for this film -  screen writer Claude Binyon, ace cameraman Charles Lang who delivered his usual soft focused, shimmering photography, musical director Victor Young, and not one but TWO costume design legends - Edith Head and Irene. They were some of the top talent in Hollywood and they hugely contribute to the films excellence.

Director Mitchell Leisen is in his top directorial form, and this movie compares well with 2 others in which he directed Ms. Colbert, ""Midnight"" {1939} and ""Arise My Love"" {1940} which combined with this one is a nice trifecta for any classic movie buff.

Ms. Colbert strikes just the right note - cool, elegant and feminine on the outside with more than enough heat percolating on the inside. Fred MacMurray is less effective in his role {in part} because of the screenplay and in his portraying Ryan as a gruff ""super macho"" tough gut with a permenant chip on his shoulder. Nevertheless his performance within it's limits is good and his well toned physique shows that he was definitely hitting the weight room. The understanding dad from his 1960's TV show ""My Three Sons"" is a far cry from his surly ,teeth gritting performance as Ryan.

This is a not an all time classic flick but a combination of attractive performers, excellent production values and Mitchell Leisen's low keyed direction makes this movie well worth watching and I give it a rating between 4 and 4 1/2 stars - Recommended.",1399593600,13,5205,4.996535796766744

8321873,5,B001MUMN1G,"This is a very good flick. There is a rather cool fantasy dream sequence That fans of the old Fawcett/Otto Binder & C.C. Beck Captain MARVEL will enjoy. WHY?!? Because, Fred MacMurray  was fully aware that Cartoonist C.C. Beck had based Captain MARVEL on himself. Fred was a weightlifter and you can see that in this movie. So Fred IS playing Captain RYAN/Captain MARVEL in this scene and the special efx are still very good and exciting today. That scene is worth any comic book fan to purchase. It's a nice romantic comedy Think I'll watch it right now.",1464393600,2,555,4.606060606060606

8321876,5,B001MUMN1G,"I have always really liked this movie. A little different story line and very well done all around. It's a different role then many remember from Fred MacMurray. Most these days probably only remember his later comedies and My 3 sons TV show. But before that he did some various other excellent kinds of movies. He actually appeared in around 100 movies. Some good Westerns too. And of course this particular movie co-stars the great Claudette Colbert. She is equally at home in dramas and zany comedies like this one. This B&W movie is a good quality reproduction and also features some superb supporting and character actors as well. Some trivia for all you Comic Book fans; Fred MacMurray actually was the physical inspiration for the Captain Marvel Comic Book Hero based on his appearance in the Claudette Colbert dream,special effects sequence which appears in this very movie. Very good staging and effects for it's day as well. Very enjoyable all around.",1456963200,9,961,4.938271604938271
