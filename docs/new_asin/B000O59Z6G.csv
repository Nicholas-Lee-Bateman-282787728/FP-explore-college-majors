8183008,5,B000O59Z6G,"I actually just have a question about this item. Is this a movie version? I was hoping this would be the actual first season of the series, which I really loved as a 7 year old growing up. I was just wondering what exactly this item is, because the description makes it sound like it's the actual first season of the series, but all of the reviews say it's a movie. I am considering buying this item, I just want to know what exactly it is. Could anybody clear this up for me?",1308096000,4,476,4.129032258064516
