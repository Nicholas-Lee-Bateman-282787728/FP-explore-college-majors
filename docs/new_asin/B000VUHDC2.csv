8220044,4,B000VUHDC2,A charming and moving Argentinian Spanish-language film with subtitles.  Contrasts the life and troubles of a once wealthy but vapid elitist with that of her loyal and long-suffering domestic worker as the country's economic system begins to corrode and affect each of them in similar--yet different ways.  Very sad and uplifiting at the same time.  Recommended not only as a work of theatrical art but also as a movie evocative of candid and realistic street scenes of the Argentinian capitol and countryside.,1266796800,4,510,5.195121951219512
8220045,4,B000VUHDC2,"Beautifully written and directed by Jorge Gaggero, ""Live-in Maid"" is a bit like an Argentine version of ""Driving Miss Daisy.""  Beba (Norma Aleandro) is an aging divorcee from the privileged upper classes whose ever-worsening financial situation is making it harder and harder for her to maintain herself in the lifestyle to which she is accustomed - including paying the salary of Dora (Norma Argentina), her loyal but longsuffering housekeeper who has put up with her boss' moodiness, petulance and condescending attitude for thirty years now.  Yet, as in ""Miss Daisy,"" the relationship between these two women cannot be pigeonholed quite so neatly.  In fact, their story, rich in ambiguity and emotional complexity, comes to reflect in miniature the much broader conflict that exists between the ruling class and the servant class in our society.

In truth, there is no logical reason why these two individuals from wildly divergent social backgrounds should even be expected to get along at all.  Certainly, Dora has every reason to resent Beba for her privilege, her rank and the often imperious manner in which she treats her.  Yet, in her own way, the stoic, taciturn Dora comes to pity Beba for the hard times, both financially and emotionally, that the previously pampered woman suddenly finds herself going through.  Indeed, things get so bad for Beba that she is forced to sell virtually everything she owns to keep herself afloat, and even has to humiliate herself by trading merchandise for food in a second-rate cafeteria.  In addition, Beba's grown daughter wants to play as little a part in her mother`s life as possible.  In the same way, although Beba clearly doesn't treat Dora as her equal, she understands deep down inside that this ""subordinate"" is also probably the only real companion left to her in the world, the one person she can reach out to for comfort and support.  The relationship between them may be one of mistress and servant, but the two parties also have much that unites them, including the problems common to women their age, their concomitant struggles with money, and the fact that fate has thrust them together for such prolonged and extended periods of time that they can`t help but get to know one another on an intimate level.  It is the discovery of their common humanity, brought about by this enforced closeness, that finally allows their relationship to blossom into a friendship between equals that crosses class lines.

On a sociological level, the movie points out the irony that it is the people with the most power who, when the chips are down, are really the most helpless and fragile - and the people with the least power who are the most persevering and tough and seemingly most equipped to cope with the vicissitudes of life.

Superbly understated performances by the pair of Normas - their scenes together are really quite breathtaking and quietly masterful - as well as flavorful and subtle storytelling make ""Live-in Maid"" an intensely poignant, wholly believable and thoroughly absorbing experience throughout.",1252108800,9,3072,5.047430830039525
8220046,5,B000VUHDC2,"Live-In Maid is that kind of movie that allows the viewer to experience conclusions with minimal dialogue, and little action that reveals so much.  And the viewer just needs to observe and feel the varying moods.  It is simple, but profound.  The movie depicts friendship in class consciousness between with wealth and hardships, and employer and employee.  Director Jorge Gaggero's Buenos Aires film won the 2005 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize.  The characters are few, and the acting is excellent!  It's the eyes, the faces, movements, and moods that express so well.  They don't have to say much, because you will get it.

Mrs. Beba lives a wealthy lifestyle, until now, and has employed Dora, a 51 year old live-in maid for nearly 30 years.  Upon opening of the story, we recognize that Mrs. Beba, tries to keep up a front about her economic demise, but Dora has not been paid for a long time.  As the movie progresses, we read more into the social status of the once-wealthy Mrs. Beba, selling things, drinking, going downhill, including in appearance.  But Dora must make the break, even as she finally gets some payment and she searches for other work.  Her home life includes her boyfriend, a lazy handyman who attempts for install a new floor in Dora's shanty home, but it remains incomplete.

Mrs. Beba has an ex-husband who she tries to resolve financial issues and borrow money from.  Included in her family is a long-lost daughter who hasn't called, but when she does, she is more comfortable speaking with Dora, the maid.  Mrs. Beba and Dora have an enduring friendship, and the movie takes the viewer to another side, a surprising move toward this relationship.  ......Rizzo",1231545600,2,1700,4.871080139372823
8220047,5,B000VUHDC2,"This was a wonderful film. Two women. The live in maid and the woman she works for--together for more than 30 years until economic problems forces the maid to leave. But they have been together for 30 years and it's difficult to just go separate ways. They are tied by a strong bond. And, actions speak louder than words in this movie. Rent it and you won't be disappointed, it was wonderful. It has won 7 awards, including latin film festival and sundance.",1220227200,3,457,4.518072289156627
8220048,4,B000VUHDC2,"This is excellent film. The unseen actor here is Argentina's severe economic crisis of the early 2000s.  There's no overt mention of it, but as we peer in here, it's ripped a giant hole in the fabric of the country.  We see its wake played out in one household.  Patrician upper-cruster Beja Pujol (Norma Aleandro) struggles to maintain her dignity, lifestyle and regal bearing. Her 'cama adentro', Dora (Norma Argentina), clearly knows more about the situation than she's letting on.  Writer/director Jorge Gaggero plays out an incremental role reversal with a subtle but brilliant denouement that finds both protagonists at Dora's residence.

Ms. Aleandro played the mother in the enjoyable Ricardo Darn film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Son-of-the-Bride/dp/B00006BS7S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Son of the Bride</a>.

What else to say about that film (tough to even start without babbling and giving away key plot lines) except that it's writer/director Fabin Bielinsky's masterpiece.",1219449600,3,1369,6.608938547486034
