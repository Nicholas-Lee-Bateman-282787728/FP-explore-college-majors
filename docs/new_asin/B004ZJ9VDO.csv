8449869,4,B004ZJ9VDO,The quality of the DVD could be better but I love the show.  The box is also cheesy in comparison to other movies I own.,1375747200,2,120,3.8
8449870,4,B004ZJ9VDO,"This two-disc set takes the second half (11 episodes) from season one.  This may sound too good to be true, but disc 1 includes five 47 minute episodes giving a total time of 4 hours, or 2 hours per each layer of the disc.
Remember that the old DVDs of the late 1990's put 2 hours on one single layer disc with little compression artifacting.  So this is sort of the same thing.

Disc 2 is not quite as good because it squeezes a 6th 47 minute episode on to the disc, creating a 4 hour and 46 minute disc. Three episodes (2 hours and 20 minutes) per layer as opposed to the 2 1/2 episodes (2 hours) per layer of disc one. This creates a softer image. It would have been preferable for Mill Creek to use a two-sided disc to reduce the compression. Considering how much is crammed onto one disc, this still looks good.

The same re-mastered 35mm transfers are used from the more-expensive 6-disc complete season one set from Shout! Factory.  Shout!'s name even appears on this set, as well as MGM Home Video and 20th Century Fox Home Video. The final name to appear on the DVD case is Mill Creek, who arranged to release this bare-bones discount set (along with the second half of season one).

What is missing are the documentaries and commentary tracks from the original, more expensive set.  If you won't miss these, then this inexpensive set is a good way to enjoy season one.

This is a good option if you are unsure if you like the series and want to give it a try.

Disclaimer: I am watching this on a Blu-ray player, upconverting the image to 1080p for a HD-TV.",1353888000,3,1567,4.339041095890411
8449871,5,B004ZJ9VDO,"While I have run across some very good television shows over the years ""thirtysomething"" remains my all-time favorite show. Before this series came out on DVD (MANY years too late in my opinion), I belonged to on-line groups that discussed the show and shared information about any possible release of the show. The characters were so real to me. I was just shy of 30 when the series came out but I wanted to be just like Michael... and of course be married to Hope. Give this series a chance. By the second or third (at the latest!) episode, you'll be hooked. Besides, it's great to go back and see hose late 80's/early 90's fashions... I promise, you'll enjoy this series!!

If I may make another plug, if you like ""thirtysomething"", you might also like the show ""The West Wing"". It's a totally different type of show but it too is a very engaging, draws you in type of show. It's created by Aaron Sorkin who is a wonderful writer. I love his fast paced, intelligent dialogue. That plus the tremendous characters created by the actors is very compelling.

NOTE: I'm writing this review for season 1 of ""thirtysomething"", but the same applies to all the different sets of the series of this show.",1348531200,,1197,4.588785046728972

==========> Eleven episodes.

If you saw this when you WERE thirty-something,
you are actually closer to being sixty-something.

Never mind that. If you ARE, or WERE... buy it while you CAN.
The episodes are slowly going out of something-in-circulation.
