8248160,5,B0012XRHCS,"This film was excellent. The cast was great. Walker, Allen and Jones were terrific. This is a very touching story about young love, family values and the value of hard work. I kept crying and smiling during the film. I truly love this film. I wish I had a father like Jones. Highly recommended!!",1474243200,,295,4.481481481481482
8248161,4,B0012XRHCS,"haven't see this movie since I was a young child maybe 6 or 7. Jimmie Walker in a non comedic role must have for your collection, if you are a fan of his. A young Debbie Allen, Tamu from the movie Claudine and James Earl Jones round out the cast. Like the other reviewer said with Blu-Ray and high tech advancements in TV viewing the quality is lacking. It plays well you can watch it with ease and it's a nice movie.",1349654400,2,417,4.097560975609756
8248162,3,B0012XRHCS,"I saw this film on some old-school channel.  I remembered this Jimmie Walker film when I was very , very young.  I forgot all about it until I saw it on TV.

I searched for the video and this is the only solution.  From the moment I recieved it I thought bootleg because it is in a slim case, but it looked more real.  Once I popped it in, I realized that the resolution and frames did not look right since I make DVDs myself.  Sure enough, this disc is on a single layer DVD at 3.8GBs!!  In this day of Blru ray, you just can't have this.  The only reaseon this could be acceptable is due to the very rare nature of the item.  It could have bee so much better is the distributors did not get cheap on the discs!!",1253232000,2,713,3.964788732394366
