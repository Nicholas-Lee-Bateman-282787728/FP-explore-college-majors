5751441,5,B00CXN3XFG,This film is a captivating and beautiful study of a unique set of characters that uses the backdrop of Reno to create an emotionally moving story which provides a distinct insight into the human condition.,1377475200,,205,4.885714285714286
5751442,4,B00CXN3XFG,"""This Is Martin Bonner"" (2913 release; 83 min.) brings the story of Martin Bonner (played by Paul Eenhorn), an Australian native but long-time US resident who recently has taken a job in Reno, NV, helping inmates at the Northern Nevada Correctional Facility to prepare for life back on the outside. By happenstance, Bonner gets to know Travis Holloway (played by Richmond Arquette), who was just released after a 12 year stint (we only learn much later what for). Both men being new to the area, they come to rely on each other for moral support. As the movie unfolds, we learn more of the personal background of each. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is one of those ""little movies that could"", and delivers a deeply moving story of two men trying to adjust to new circumstances. ""This Is Martin Bonner"" moves at snail's pace, and I mean that as a compliment. Check out the scene in which Travis finally meets up with his now 24 yr. old daughter Diana (played by Sam Buchanan) for the first time since his incarceration 12 years ago. It is for me the pivotal scene in the movie. The performances are ace throughout, although I will see that I was very much taken by Sam Buchanan's performance (she has maybe 15 minutes of screen time, but sure makes the most of it). Finally, kudos as well to writer-director Chad Hartigan, who has delivered nothing short of a gem. But what is with the movie title? This movie is as much about Travis Holloway as it is about Martin Bonner, and so on that account it could've just as easily have been called ""This Is Travis Holloway"".

I saw the movie this weekend at the Downtown Independent in Los Angeles, and the screening I saw this at was not well attended, unfortunately. It surely is not a reflection of the movie's worthiness. If you are in the mood for a great indie movie that is miles away from the standard Holywood fare, by all means do check out ""This Is Martin Bonner"", be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""This Is Martin Bonner"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377302400,4,2123,4.526041666666667

5751447,5,B00CXN3XFG,"Jerked to attention by a raging foul-mouthed inmate, masterfully played by Demetrius Grosse, we expect some high drama ahead.  Instead we're invited to spend some quiet time with 2 men from opposite sides of the law --Martin Bonner (Paul Eenhoorn) and Travis Holloway ( Richmond Arquette). Martin is a good-natured, multidimensional man who's just started as coordinator and mentor for newly released men. Travis is one of those men. He appears a somewhat fearful, tentative, also good guy, who's made a dreadful mistake; his caution, likely resultant from his desire to not mess up again. Their lives converge, and the stories of their failures, loves, losses, and starting-over cause them to connect. Chad Hartigan, the writer/director creates and builds curiosity and expectancy, This unfolding, in the luxury of time, adds a natural unrushed reality and authenticity to the storyline. And in spite of the absence of melodrama and histrionics, you might just suffer a tear or two. These two characters remind us that independence in the absence of connectedness is just half the deal. The cinematography (Sean McElwee) is first-rate in both content and ease of transitions.  Music (Keegan DeWitt) has enormous range and diversity and is beautifully congruent with the action and storyline. The acting by the 2 leads is first-rate. Eenhoorn is prodigious.

I reveled in this for the Reno/Sparks locales, shot in many places I frequented (The Gold and Silver Inn, Anchor Auctions, Carrow's, etc) and full of street scenes and outdoor shots.  Sparks wasn't mentioned, but the motel where the ex-convict was placed appeared to be in Victorian Square across the street from John Asquaga's Nugget in Sparks.

When I lived in Reno I worked with the court system and with ex-cons, and associated with religious groups seeking to help them acclimate to life on the outside.  This rang true from beginning to end, and the acting was excellent.  The fact that Martin was questing and just as lost as his client is so often the case.  The film is episodic and meandering, with (as frequently in life) no resolution, which may leave you dangling.  I bought this after viewing, as a reminder of Reno, but I think this film will have the greatest appeal for ex-cons and those who work with them.  For me, the scene in Carrow's summed it up perfectly (a triumph, but a small one, in a sea of fits and starts).  Very realistic.",1479427200,4,1068,4.578947368421052

5751460,4,B00CXN3XFG,"THIS IS MARTIN BONNER focuses on the lives of two misfits trying to
adjust to a new life in the desert city of Reno, Navada. Australian
migr Martin (Paul Eenhoorn) tries to adjust to life as a volunteer in
a local jail after having experienced a crisis of faith followed by
long-term unemployment. Travis Holloway (Richmond Arquette) is released
from the same jail, and attempts to forge a new life outside by living
in a seedy motel and working as a car park attendant. Both men have
grown-up children: Martin communicates mostly by phone, while Travis'
daughter Diana (Sam Buchanan) hasn't seen her father since he went to
prison twelve years previously. When father and daughter do meet, the
conversation remains awkward, to say the least. Chad Hartigan's
low-budget drama focuses on the loneliness of the two protagonists'
lives as they spend their evenings in nondescript rooms, roam the
streets either on foot, in the car or on the bus, and try to connect
with people around them. Reno is hardly the place for lonely men to
live; the streets are deprived of pedestrians, while cars endlessly
shoot by on the interstate highway. The skies are crystal-clear, but
the architecture seems to be deliberately designed to shut out as much
daylight as possible. Sean McElwee's cinematography sums up the
protagonists' lives through a clever use of framing; on several
occasions their profiles are seen at the extreme left or right of the
frame looking desolately at the landscape stretching endlessly before
them. Even when they try to communicate, they are verbally challenged:
what is not said is more significant than what is said. The narrative
of THIS IS MARTIN BONNER unfolds at a slow pace, but the film remains a
penetrating study of life in an impersonal city.",1407196800,5,1767,4.932885906040268
5751461,3,B00CXN3XFG,"The action here is not slow. Except for some encouraging scenes early on, it's non-existent.

The story begins with two men from an ex-con recovery ministry conducting a stormy interview with a convict named Locy (Demetrius Grosse), who is hostile to their proposal that he avail himself of their help after his release from prison. Once that scene has ended, the fiery Locy disappears from the story forever.

Next to appear is an ex-con named Travis (Richmond Arquette, who signs up for the program. He meets and begins to develop a relationship with his program mentor Steve (Robert Longstreet), but that plot thread is also abandoned abruptly, as Travis decides Robert is ""too Christian"" for him.

In terms of the plot, two most alive characters are now dead. And so is the rest of the movie, which tortuously takes the viewer through slow, flat scenes, while the too-loud and uninteresting score tries its best to keep us awake.

I gave the movie three stars for the acting by the Martin Bonner character (Paul Eenhoorn), Arquette, Grosse, and Longstreet, who are unfortunately portrayed in the script as smaller than life. Travis' distant daughter April is overacted by Kristin Slaysman.

I recommend the movie for insomniacs.",1405036800,,1232,5.019607843137255
5751462,4,B00CXN3XFG,"I like movies which shed light on real issues, and I give this movie 4 stars for that reason and because it is very well acted.  I felt slapped in the face the way it ended so abruptly, though:  the real action of the story was just getting started, and I was tempted to give it as low as 2.5 stars because of the lack of climax and failure to finish developing the plot.

The thing I liked most about the story is its realistic portrayal of religious hypocrisy and the way it negates the very essence of what religion is supposed to be about.  What I have to say about that is copied from a comment I made on a 2 star review.  The reviewer stated: ""There's a good scene in the church where we get a sense that Travis is not too excited by all the Christian 'devotion'.""  I replied as follows:

I disagree because I got the opposite impression.  First, I EXPECTED Travis to not be interested in the church service since church attendance is likely mandated by the rehab program and it was, thus, was not his free choice to attend.  And, yes, at first, he looks like he feels out of place.  But by the end of the service he seems to have warmed up to it, and in the shot outside when he is shaking the preacher's hand he appears genuinely to be thankful for having attended and for meeting people he thinks might be able to help him rebuild his life.  (Don't you think he was being genuine when he answered the videotaped survey questions, and said he was grateful for meeting people who could be role models for him?  I think he was being genuine.)

Reviewer then said, ""Later that's confirmed when he has lunch with Bonner and confesses that his mentor's faith has no meaning to him.""  I disagreed: Travis does not say that his mentor's faith 'has no meaning to him'!  Quite the contrary!  He tells Bonner that he believes in God and feels instinctually that his devotion should be an all or nothing proposition, but that since he cannot commit either way he feels uncomfortable being around someone as 'over-the-top' as his mentor.  This is one key aspect of the film's realism (to me): people like the mentor OFTEN turn off genuine seekers like Travis, and it is because the over-the-top 'devotion' they exhibit is usually a fraud: they are either posers or deceived or a combination.

I hate religious hypocrisy so I thought one of the best parts of the film was this portrayal of the hyper-Christian couple.  Note that Travis' mentor says he is 'on fire' for helping people like Travis, yet he is so out of touch with human values he cannot extend Travis even the simple courtesy of sharing a cup of coffee with him before church.  Omg did that small moment resonate with me.  I live in the heart of the central Texas Bible belt (where there are literally churches on every corner) and these people will preach to you in a New York minute -- indeed, just the other day a stranger in the grocery store side-tracked my shopping for over 45 minutes! -- but they have almost no ability to engage in simple human courtesy.  They seem not to have gotten the memo that ""if you are not faithful in the small things, God will never entrust you with larger things"": one builds upon the other (Luke 16:10).  Ex: the moving sermon you preach to people you do not know means nothing if you go home and ignore your isolated teen who is spending the evening locked in his/her room.  (For an older movie which is all about this, watch Robert de Niro and Farrah Fawcett in 'The Apostle.')

I believe in Christ and have a personal relationship with God . . . but Christianity is so riddled with deception I question it as a legitimate vehicle for God's will (and I think this is one of the messages of this film when you consider that the one person who actually helps Travis is a man who only recently realized that HIS lifetime 'devotion to God' was never the real thing despite his possession of a degree in theology and life-long work in ministry).",1404086400,,3939,4.422437673130194
5751463,2,B00CXN3XFG,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

RATING: 2.5 out of 5.0

 This is Chris Hartigan's second feature, mainly shot in Reno, Nevada. It's a low key story about Australian native Martin Bonner, a volunteer counselor for a Christian-based group who has a mentoring program to rehabilitate convicts. Ironically, one of the most powerful scenes in the film is right at the beginning, when Bonner and his mentor-supervisor, interview an angry black inmate, to consider him for their program. The impatient, arrogant inmate disparages their attempt to help him and declines to participate.

We're then introduced to another inmate, Travis, who decides to join the Christian group--he's been incarcerated for over ten years for a DWI vehicular manslaughter. Bonner meets with Travis first but informs him that he's just the coordinator for the program, and that he's actually assigned to a regular mentor. Bonner gives Travis his card and tells him to call him anytime if he needs help.

Travis is set up at a motel and has dinner with his regular mentor and his wife. There's a good scene in the church where we get a sense that Travis is not too excited by all the Christian 'devotion'. Later that's confirmed when he has lunch with Bonner and confesses that his mentor's faith has no meaning to him. Bonner reciprocates by confessing that he too, lost 'faith' in the church a couple of years ago, after working for a Christian organization for quite some time.

Bonner is the far better developed character than Travis. Hartigan fleshes out Bonner a bit by depicting his relationship with a daughter and son. The daughter is far away in Maryland, married with child, and Bonner often talks to her on the phone. The son is an artist but never returns his father's phone calls. Finally, the son sends him one of his oil paintings as a present but still never speaks with his father. That's a plot strand that goes nowhere as we never meet the son and no direct conflict between them, is depicted. Similarly, when Bonner goes speed dating and meets a woman, there's no follow up; an opportunity for some additional drama is lost. I did like how Bonner's back story includes mention of his days as a rock musician playing for his band 'Kopyright'. At one point, Bonner puts on an old 8 track tape from his old band, and dances to it while alone at home (the music also plays during the closing credits).

On the other hand, we find out little about Travis, including details about the crime he was incarcerated for, his life in prison as well as his earlier days. Instead, the earlier history is supposed to be filled in with the awkward questions he asks his daughter, who has driven three hours by bus, to meet him for lunch.

This meeting is the central dramatic moment in the film. Travis brings Bonner to the lunch with his daughter on the pretext that she's requested him all along. Bonner soon discovers that it was Travis who wanted Bonner to tag along and the daughter had no prior knowledge that he was coming. Bonner expresses his disappointment with Travis and leaves him to fend for himself. The conversation then deteriorates with Travis only remembering things about his daughter that occurred years ago, which she can't remember herself.

Suddenly Bonner saves the day by returning to the table and acting as ref between the estranged daughter and desperate father. Did Bonner actually get in his car and drive away and then have a change of conscience? Or did he plan it this way, stand outside and give them a few minutes, knowing all along that they needed him to come back and restore some semblance of equilibrium? All Mr. Hartigan wants us to know that ultimately Bonner came back and saved the day.

Now Travis owes Bonner a favor in return. The church group videotapes Travis' testimonial which consists of two short questions, putting minimal pressure on the recalcitrant former inmate. And that's it folks! If you're looking for high stakes, you will not find it here. 'This is Martin Bonner' advertises Travis committing some kind of big 'betrayal'; one might expect some kind of violent incident since it involves a character who is an ex-con. But all it comes down to is a lack of confidence on the ex-inmate's part and a white lie to cover up this lack of confidence.

The film's ace in the hole is Paul Eenhoorn who is excellent as the sturdy program coordinator. Hartigan must be commended for fashioning this low-key drama that keeps your interest to the end. For future efforts, however, he needs to focus more on character development, higher stakes in the plot as well as creating a denouement that doesn't end too abruptly and feels a bit more satisfying than what occurs here.",1392249600,,4710,4.759803921568627

5751465,3,B00CXN3XFG,"These characters are so real that the movie may seem too boring for some.  In a way, it reminds me of the part in the excellent movie 'Adaptation' where Nicholas Cage's character (Kaufman) asks Brian Cox's character (Robert McKee) 'What if a writer creates a play where nothing much happens?'.  Before McKee really rails into Kaufman he somewhat calmly responds, 'If you write a screen play without conflict or crisis you'll bore your audience to tears.'  The conflict and crisis in 'This is Martin Bonner' is so subtle compared to 95% of the films today, that most would find it boring.  For some of us who appreciate an occasional 'real-life' movie with no melodrama, this movie has good acting and ended right when I was about to get bored, but with a good anticlimactic open-ended finish.  Watch 'This is Martin Bonner' with your MSO at home and enjoy.",1388966400,2,856,4.756756756756757

I thought Richmond Arquette portrayal of Travis Holloway was excellent.  I found myself really pulling for this character.  I kept worrying that something tragic was going to befall Travis - but it didn't.  That's because there was no climax in the movie.  Travis gets released from prison after serving 12 years for involuntary manslaughter and Martin Bonner is his ""volunteer coordinator.  That's it.  That's the whole movie.  No anti-climax either.  No up, no down, no anything.  It was like a movie about a three-week segment of two peoples' lives where not much happened.  And I don't think that's enough to warrant a film.  I think to rave about this movie (as others have) is akin to standing in a museum, staring at a blank, white canvas and bloviating about how the artist brought out the simplicity of the common man's plight.",1380067200,,949,4.713414634146342
5751471,5,B00CXN3XFG,"The story involves an older, gray haired man starting a new job in a correctional institute in Reno.  We see him unpacking his few belongings in a modest apartment and endure a difficult first day at the job.  Then he picks up a fellow on the road who has just been released.  What unfolds is the friendship between the two and the way each of them copes with the challenges of his new life.

The actors are first rate.  I was particularly impressed by Richmond Arquette as Travis Holloway, the ex-con.  From the first moment when we see him hunched down to protect himself from the cold, he portrays a very believable person.  As wonderful as all the actors were it is Travis' face that stuck with me long after seeing the show.  He's just so ordinary...he isn't handsome, sexy, charismatic or smart.  And yet there's more to him than that, too.  In a way it's really Travis' movie and I have to wonder why it's titled after Martin.  Sam Buchanan as Diana, Travis' daughter gives a killer performance in her few minutes on the screen.  Her facial expressions in the restaurant, as  she attempts to deal with Travis' clumsy way of getting to know her, are painfully accurate.  I loved her clothes, too....it's all just very well done!  The couple playing the Christian helpers were right-on, too.  I liked the fact that Christians were not portrayed as ignorent biggots  as is fashionable in many Hollywood films.  They weren't glorified either.  Again I found the portrayals very realistic.

The character of Martin Bonner is really central to the film and he is well played by Paul  .  He is shown to be an uncommonly decent guy and we root for him throughout the film.  The only thing that bothered me was that he was probably too upbeat and cheerful.  I would have thought that his recent trials would have beat a lot of that sparkle out of him, especially at his age.

My other disappointment was that the film was too short.  It ended too abruptly.  But I guess it had told its story and knew when to quite.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I still give it five stars and a strong recommendation to anyone who wants to see a real and good story about real and good people.",1379289600,,2180,4.517948717948718

However it seemed like just as the movie started, it was over. This film is eerily similar to Dustin Hoffman's ""Straight Time"", although in that film there were no positive supporting role models for his character when he got out of prison. With this film I could see the story they were trying to build. However this film lacked any real climatic moments other than the meeting at the diner with Travis and his daughter. In my opinion there were too many scenes spent trying to build each of the characters. When the movie ended I could not tell what path their lives were going to lead. With all that being said I still enjoyed the movie. It was a refreshing change from the drab bore stuff Hollywood has been putting out lately. This was real acting in this movie, and not some comic book character with a lot of special effects.

Glad we watched it. The two lead characters were given a depth without having to reveal too much (leaving much room for imagination, or even identification).
Whether the movie ends up communicating that one doesn't have to have it all together to be a good person, or whether one doesn't have to be Christian to do right by his neighbor is not yet clear to me.
