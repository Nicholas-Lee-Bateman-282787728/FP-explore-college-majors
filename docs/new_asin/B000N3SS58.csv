8174426,2,B000N3SS58,"Boring. For a bike film to succeed, in my opinion, it has to have at least a little bit of drama. Just showing bikes and listening to regular-guy interviews is dull. Living the bike life is better than watching folks talking about it.",1456012800,,234,4.465116279069767

There are far better videos out there to be seen on the subject of Sturgis, this one is a total waste of your time and money!",1391212800,2,305,4.258620689655173
