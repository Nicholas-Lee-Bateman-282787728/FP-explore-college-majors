4962210,5,B0066E6UGW,One of my favorite movies. If you like classic movies you will love it. Charles Coburn gives the performance of a lifetime.,1392940800,2,123,4.636363636363637
4962211,4,B0066E6UGW,"Thought about giving this one five stars but don't want to quite rate it with the classics.  I had read the book recently which is very worthwhile if you get the chance.  Coburn is great as usual as the somewhat reprobate great-grandfather.  Tom Drake who you probably remember best from Meet Me In St. Louis is good as the older ""Robbie"", but it is really Dean Stockwell as the young Robbie that steals the show.  You also might enjoy a young Jessica Tandy as Robbie's aunt.  Unfortunately you can never pull all the story lines into a two hour movie that are covered in a best seller, but they do a fair job here.  I have read a number of 30's and 40's era best sellers that were butchered in their movie versions and thankfully most of the charm, humor, and pain that are in the Cronin book are brought to the film.  Very much worth a watch.",1388880000,,844,4.30379746835443

4962215,5,B0066E6UGW,"Unfortunately, the 'Editorial Review' is a bit off in its description of this film. The story is about a young boy (Dean Stockwell) who arrives in Scotland from Ireland after the death of his Scottish mother (who was the widow of an Irishman). The boy was then to be raised by his grandfather's (Hume Cronyn)family. And due in part to his grandfather's strict and unloving manner, the young boy becomes quite close to his kind-hearted great-grandfather (Charles Coburn).

I first stumbled on this movie a couple of years ago during an online search. From start to finish it is a wonderful story of personal tragedy and triumph. The first half of the movie follows the trials of the young boy as he adopts to his new family, home, and school in Scotland. The second half chronicles the same character, now grown up, just after graduating from high school and his pursuits over the next few years. I hesitate to share more for fear of spoiling any of this wonderful story.

On a final note, I find it often the case that when characters in movies 'grow up' the actors playing the same characters 'before and after' growing up don't seem to match well with one another at all. This movie is a wonderful exception to that! The story kept moving beautifully and the transition to the grown up characters was done exceptionally well.",1349308800,25,1327,4.690987124463519

4962241,4,B0066E6UGW,"Wonderful film Charles Coburn (Grand dad) is just loveable, personally I have yet to see him play a character I don't like. A young Jessica Tandy plays the aunt and a young Hume Cronin plays the penny pinching grandfather. Good story and a fun movie for the hole family.",1422057600,3,270,4.530612244897959

4962243,5,B0066E6UGW,"I bought this film simply for nostalgia. I saw the film when it came out -- in fact I stayed in the theater and saw it a second time before I had to go home. I wondered if I would still like the film so many years later. I did.

This is a 'feel good' movie with a happy ending. It is also a movie that still makes me cry. It is the story of an orphaned Irish Catholic boy who is sent to live with his Presbyterian relatives in Scotland. It has all the religious prejudices of the time. The boy is befriended by his grandfather and they form a life long bond, the grandfather defending his grandson both at home and in the village. There are friendships, school, coal mining, poverty and greed, all mixed together. The story, with all its hardships, is told with humor but also with a clear moral base.

The boy grows into a man who has accepted his place in the family--no longer fighting against his fate. He tries for a scholarship but fails due to severe illness. He is now in love but is too poor to marry. He accepts his fate as a coal miner. He does not feel sorry for himself, does not complain. We feel a great deal of compassion for him.

The human pettiness, sorrows and joys of life in a small village makes a good story. The acting, especially by Charles Coburn, is wonderful. I still enjoyed Tom Drake and Dean Stockwell.

Recommended for anyone who wants to remember the way movies used to be: free of nudity, sex and gratuitous violence. Emphasis is on story line, Christian values, a moral code, and bravery in the face of constant bullying and rejection. It is a good companion film to the other A. J. Cronyn film ""The Keys of the Kingdom."" Based upon the novel by the same name by A. J. Cronyn.",1415923200,11,1712,4.258461538461538
4962244,5,B0066E6UGW,"This delightful film is one I will watch many times to be sure.  It is a storyline from many years ago, with great acting, and a thumbnail view of life in a bygone era.",1395360000,4,168,3.9411764705882355

8493942,5,B0066E6UGW,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out in 1946.  I've always liked it, watching it every time it was aired by TCM.

8493951,5,B0066E6UGW,"Absolutely one of the most charming and heart-warming films I have seen in years!  Based on a j Cronin's novel of the same name, wherein he draws upon his own catholic childhood in a small intolerant Scottish town, this 1946 black and white classic shows us the small frightened and well-mannered boy arriving to a household of eccentrics. His Irish father is long dead and his Scottish mother recently passed, so this only child becomes the responsibility of his grandparents and great grandfather and an aunt and uncle.

Immediately we meet the grandfather the Great, who loves drinking and telling tall tales.  His story of the battlr with the Zulu warriors who threw a poison spear at his nose so that it turned red: this scene alone of the poor old Charles Coburn character made me smile and feel warm all over, for one can see that the boy is doing the old man as much or more good as the old man is doing for the lost soul lonely orphan.  Even funnier is the boy telling the rest of the scoffing and penny pinching family that now he knows why great grandfather's nose is red - from the Zulus!

The Famiky is not exactly poor but very very very concerned with money.  They live poor because they think poor: it comes out the same in the end.  And so the wee laddie is sent to a boys school called the a Academy, where he is the best in science and wins top prize for his curious mind.  His professor believes in him and gets him ready at 17 to take the exam for the Marshall Prize, which will give the boy four years' university scholarship to become a doctor.

Otherwise it is the boiler room of the mines for our sharp clever lad.

The story is built not so much in suspense of the boy's future as the shaping of his character by the people he grows up with.  He loves a local girl since childhood and she loves him back in a pure young way.  She is talented in singing and goes to a music academy when she graduates high school. He wants to marry her but cannot because of his poverty.

The story twists and turns and carries the viewer along inthe best of hopes for young idealistic Robby. Will he succeed?  How can he get ahead without college and the money to do it with?  His great grandfather never stops caring for him and pushing him to have courage.  ""Be a man! You are a man!"" He tells the young Robby, when grandmother wants to get him away from the evil influences of his great grandfather.  He pipes up and announces that he will be sleeping with greatgrandfather because he is a man! And that's it!  Scenes like this can fill your heart with a warm gladness that modern more cynical films never seem to show.

I love it when Charles coburn breaks the doctors orders to stay in bed.  He gets up for the big day of the Scottish Fair and puts on his quilt and off he goes.  He meets his buddies and has a drink as he knows he shouldn't.  When the games are winding down, he has the fatal heart attack as the bsgpipes play ""long live the King"". Yet he smiles and says, ""oh that is nice of them of play that"". And he dies happy with Robby by his side.  To think that he thinks he is a king !!!i love it!  It is such an Irish sense of humor !

How marvelous too that the life insurance pay out goes to Robby and not the greedy nephew.

You can watch this film and feel the weight of worry about elections and crime and immigration crises of Europe simply melt away as you are transported to another time and place.  Suddenly the future doesn't look so grim!",1453766400,,3474,4.248097412480974
