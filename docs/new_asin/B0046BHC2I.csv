4267687,5,B0046BHC2I,"Loved this movie!  I had the chance to see it at a special screening for a charity fundraiser, and it was a blast.  Power, the main character, lives in the middle of nowhere, New Mexico, and although he spends his days working at a refinery, his life revolves around the ""art"" of ""air drumming.""  Circumstances evolve so that he eventually winds up in the Big Apple competing in a high stakes air drumming competition.  To be totally honest, I found the very beginning of the movie a little slow, but it quickly picked up speed, and I enjoyed every minute of it.  It's very funny, with a great cast including Michael McKean from ""Spinal Tap,"" Jane Lynch, of ""Glee"" fame, and Adrian Grenier, from ""Entourage.""  The soundtrack's terrific, especially for those who came of age in the '80s.  (If you didn't, then you might not be as thrilled about that as I was.  My thirteen-year-old didn't care for the music at all, but, what does she know?!!)  Artists featured include Neil Peart and Rush, the Daz Band's ""Whip It,"" and more.  What's not to love?  The film carries a wonderful message, too, about following your dream no matter what other people might think and no matter how daunting the obstacles are to overcome.  It reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite in that regard.  I have no idea why it didn't make it to the theaters, but I definitely intend to grab it on DVD.  I hope you will too!",1291420800,2,1388,4.544354838709677
4267688,5,B0046BHC2I,"Saw this at Sundance, SO funny! Awesome soundtrack, Rush...Loverboy!!!!! Funny, but also sweet...Adrian Grenier (dude from Entourage) is HILARIOUS!! Funniest I've ever seen him!",1289779200,2,177,6.416666666666667
4267689,5,B0046BHC2I,"This movie is one of the funniest I have ever seen!! I saw it at a film festival in 2009 and since then have wished that my friends could see it, too. It made me laugh so hard I cried and then my stomach hurt, too! I'm so glad it's out on DVD now. Offbeat humor with an underlying positive message. Great soundtrack of original and previously recorded music. This is a must see for anyone who loves movies about music (The Commitments, High Fidelity, Spinal Tap). Fans of the music of Rush or Phil Collins should also see this movie.",1289260800,2,533,4.287128712871287
4267690,5,B0046BHC2I,I was fortunate enough to catch a screening of this in NYC.  It was awesome.  The soundtrack has all of the best air-drum songs you can think of including Tom Sawyer by Rush and In the Air Tonight from Phill Collins.  The cast includes Jane Lynch (love her!) Adrian Grenier from Entourage and Michael McKean (from Spinal Tap & Laverne and Shirley) and Ari Gold is awesome as Power.  I can't wait to own the DVD and watch it over and over.,1289260800,,438,4.304878048780488
4267691,5,B0046BHC2I,"ok so glad I have this DVD in my Collection, As I could not imagine my collection without it! Thank you.",1384300800,,104,4.0
4267692,3,B0046BHC2I,"I'm not into air anything whatsoever but I liked this movie. Just a silly movie with good music and some funny moments. I would have thought air drumming would be fairly easy but after seeing this it definitely doesn't seem to be, and that puts a bit of a damper on me wanting to learn to play the drums for real. Nothing overwhelmingly amazing but overall an ok movie and worth the little it is to buy.",1367884800,,403,4.246753246753247
4267693,2,B0046BHC2I,"Not a good film. I agree with many of the reviews outside of Amazon. It felt like the filmmaker wanted to jump on the coattails of Napoleon Dynamite's success and do something similar. I gave it two stars instead of just one, because at least he tried and I felt his effort, but this film really plain and simply was a poor story, along with everything else.",1362355200,,358,4.358208955223881
4267694,3,B0046BHC2I,"And I enjoyed it. Air drumming is a way of life for Power (Ari Gold). He is obsessed with Neil Peart and cereal. After being fired from his mining job, Power BMX bikes 40 miles to an illegal Mexican air drumming competition. The Spanish Death Metal proves too much for him, as the police come in to bust up the racket. On a tip, he then hitchhikes to New Jersey to hook up with an air drumming krew. Power is relegated to floor tom. He is staying at a mission above a Chinese take-out restaurant, and falls in love with a deaf girl whose mother thinks Rock & Roll is the work of the devil. But rebellious Annie is charmed, and wants to see the music she can't hear.",1358294400,,665,4.162790697674419
4267695,5,B0046BHC2I,I saw this at the Austin Film Festival and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD! It's worth every penny.,1355788800,,107,3.909090909090909
4267696,1,B0046BHC2I,"This is not a sweet movie, it wants to be or appear to be.  It tries to hard to be that.  Not recommended, it could carry a more mature rating.",1345420800,,143,3.7333333333333334
4267697,5,B0046BHC2I,It was like if Napoleon Dynamite and Hot Rod had a baby. I very much enjoyed this movie. It seemed refreshingly fresh with just enough cliche to make you feel like you were at home in your own little rented unventilated man cave eating the perfect blend of cold cereals while listening to RUSH and pounding away on a 28 piece air drum set.,1328918400,,339,4.3125
4267698,5,B0046BHC2I,"I was hooked when Rush's Tom Sawyer was the running thread throught this tale of air drummer supremacy with a factory town drama background.  The actors acted with freedom, and this added to the odd attraction of the film. I have seen this film 3 times since buying it for 8 bucks after shipping, and will watch it many more times.  I nice clean film.  It barely deserves the pg-13 rating, and is less racey than any drama crime show reruns kids see at any hour of the day.  A fun flick!",1318204800,2,487,4.260869565217392
4267699,5,B0046BHC2I,I love this movie. Both as a musician and a fan of music inspired films. Also.... the strong link to Neal Peart is really cool. The extras on the dvd are also great!,1317513600,,165,4.03030303030303
4267700,4,B0046BHC2I,"Although The Adventures of Power received plenty of hate on Netflix and Rottentomatoes, I happen to think the film was pretty clever and funny (in a silly kind of way). The humor here is a little more understated and probably won't appeal to some, but I thought it was an awesome comedy.  The Adventures of Power is finally something original with a fantastic soundtrack (if you love classic 80s rock such as Rush, Loverboy, or Mr. Mister), hilarious scenes reminiscent of Spinal Tap, and a good message about the underdog overcoming odds. There is also a love story, as Power meets Annie, a girl he falls for, who gives Power the inspiration to drum. The film is able to balance a bit of satire and wit with plain goofiness to create laughs.

The Adventures of Power tells the story of one young man and his dream of air drumming. Power has always felt he had something special (even if it wasn't a set of drums), and while his uncle chastises him, telling him that people are making fun of him, Power still believes that good will come of his ""talent."" His air drumming skills take him to talent shows, to an illegal underground air drumming contest in Mexico, which features a motley mix of air drummers trying to keep up with speed metal, and finally to an all-stakes air drum showdown in Newark.  Carlos, a man without hands to drum, sees Power as the next great hope in air drumming, and enlists him. With his fascination with Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"", Power makes the trip to the big time with hopes of achieving great things. To do this, he and his fellow air drummers will have to battle the best of the best air drummers.

Many have noted the similarities between The Adventures of Power with Napoleon Dynamite and Dodgeball. While it has a similar feel to these comedies, Power still does its own thing and has originality, which is seriously lacking in many comedies. Power has a bit of a flair for silliness, spoof and satire. Power is a breath of fresh air from the many gross out, high school, frat brother, mean-spirited, formulaic comedies recycled and thrown up onto the big screen.

The extras are worthy of purchase as well. Included is a commentary and interview with Ari Gold, the star and producer as well as a drum off with Rush drummer, Neil Peart.

The Adventures of Power is a hidden gem.",1315958400,2,2310,4.581113801452784
4267701,5,B0046BHC2I,"This movie is amazing!  I've been checking the internet every couple months for the last 3 years waiting for this movie to come out.  I saw it at Sundance Film Festival in 2008 and it was a total hit!  I don't know what hollywood had against releasing this movie....this movie brings the house down!  Everyone in the packed theater was laughing out loud and loving it.  This movie is original and just plain Awesome!  Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Air Drumming, a great plot, great directing, intense entertainment.....this is a must see!",1306195200,,536,4.835164835164835
4267702,5,B0046BHC2I,The DVD I ordered was received very well packed and came in a shorter length of time than expected.  Very fast and excellent service.  Very happy with this order.,1299024000,,162,4.551724137931035
4267703,5,B0046BHC2I,"I got this movie because I heard that Neil Peart from Rush was in it. It is a must see for all Rush fans! I wasn't expecting too much from the story, but I was pleasantly surprised.
It was a great heartwarming, funny movie all the way through. I could really relate to it. I am going through some similar union problems and I love air drumming.
I vividly remember air drumming to the drum solo in Working Man on the album All the Worlds a Stage by Rush. I got it down perfectly, and would finish dripping with sweat and worn out.
I would highly recommend this movie and can't wait for more like it. I really enjoyed the Interview and drum off with Neil Peart. He is so eloquent and interesting. He is the best lyric writer of all time! I used to read his lyrics and would have to go grab a dictionary and look words up when I was younger. He helped me to become a better English student and got me into lyric writing too. We should really support these independent film makers, so that there are more movies with substance to choose from out there. The typical Hollywood movies are getting so generic and predictable. Go Power!",1299024000,3,1127,4.295774647887324
4267704,5,B0046BHC2I,"If you want to sit down and watch 89 minutes of just pure joy, this is it.  If you want to be entertained by a film that has so much heart, this is it.  All of the actors, Michael McKean, Jane Lynch, Chiu Chi Ling, Shoshannah Stern and especially the fellow air-drummers (plus the real life drummer, Neil Peart) bring so much life to this story.  If you finally want to see a film with a new kind of hero that does his own stunts...without the help of special effects and CGI, this is it.  Ari Gold has written, directed and stars in a film that for me that brings back the innocence of what a film should be...full of heart with great characters.  It is quirky comedic tale of a quest to pursue your dreams (in this case to be the best air-drummer in the world) no matter what people think of them.  It is also a tale that underscores that you should never lose sight of the power of love and how it can be to guide you to those dreams...no matter who you are.  Buy this film for your collection and you will be glad you did!",1298764800,,1026,4.1
4267705,5,B0046BHC2I,"I really loved this movie!!! I was so excited when I got it,I even sang ""I got the power"" after I collected my mail! And what's even greater than that was that it wasn't a massive let down! Very funny,clean and sweet!",1296604800,3,217,4.190476190476191
4267706,5,B0046BHC2I,"I've been following ""Adventures of Power"" on FaceBook for quite a while, and was so excited that it was finally released on DVD! Yes, it's campy, but I think that's the point. It's ""Napoleon Dynamite""-esque, so if you didn't like ND, chances are AoP is not for you. But it's been a long time since I have seen a totally original movie that had complex story lines for multiple characters. The movie is designed to relate to ""everyman"" - there are issues that we all can relate to regardless of socioeconomic status. If you are a musician - especially a percussionist - you will definitely relate to this movie. And make sure you take a look at the Bonus Features, as they include an interview with Rush drummer Neil Peart and a ""drum-off"" between Ari Gold (Power) and Peart!

I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates good, old fashioned comedy draped in a bit of drama and a lot of camp.",1296518400,4,902,4.533742331288344
4267707,5,B0046BHC2I,"""Adventures of Power"" is an absolute delight that the whole family can enjoy!!!

4267710,5,B0046BHC2I,"I got the chance to watch the movie in Berlin, Germany with Q&A with Ari Gold. He was a great host and was around for more questions after the screening. The movie is really funny and has got a great soundtrack. It's a mix of nostalgia, random quotes and a hell of an air drum session. The great thing is that you get great production value with the heart of an indie movie. You will be surprised by this movie for sure!",1291939200,2,420,4.134146341463414

8417162,5,B0046BHC2I,"This movie is pure awesome. It has so much heart. Ari Gold's Power is every teenage wannabearockstar dreamer who never grew up. The casting is great, but what can you expect with Michael McKean of Spinal Tap fame acting as Power's father? It lends an air of legitimacy (though not necessary) to this movie that could have easily been a rock/mockumentary but thankfully went for a straight up story.
It's like the rock-n-roll version of Napoleon Dynamite, with a perfect soundtrack heavily relying on Rush's Tom Sawyer as its theme. After messing up at his job, Power leaves his home to pursue his dream as a professional air drummer. There is a great love story in there, too, featuring a beautiful deaf actress who plays the daughter of a fundamentalist Christian.  The mom is heavily opposed to rock and roll and her daughter's new infatuation. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get chills, but you won't pussyfoot--you'll double-bass drum!",1417132800,,941,4.955696202531645

8417164,5,B0046BHC2I,"I met Ari Gold (writer, director, and lead star) of this hilarious look at the life of an air drummer. This is a terrific look at a subject that doesn't get nearly enough coverage in the entertainment industry, the ""air"" musicians of our day. It follows the life of an out of sync young man named Power who has trouble in his daily life working on an oil platform. The juxtapostion of political commentary of worker safety and the ability to unionize with the ridiculousness of Power's only talent of wanting to become the world's greatest air drummer is as hilarious as a movie can get. Great acting from Michael McKean as Power's father and Jane Lynch from the Christopher Guest movies. I was impressed by Ari's ability to get permission from all of the musicians and ASCAP to feature all of the songs in the film. Hilarious concept and execution by Ari and his crew. I highly recommend this film!",1387497600,,899,4.590062111801243
8417165,5,B0046BHC2I,"How is it even humanly possible to go from silly to absurd to sublime all in one movie or even in the same scene? And yet while you're watching it, you can't figure out which of the three it is? Genius, pure genius. But is it funny? Aw, now that depends upon you having a slightly off-kilter sense of humor. Since I think that I bought this movie at the dollar store, I wasn't expecting Chaucer. And since it was ironing night, I didn't need to watch anything all that good. Yet this movie was just too quirky not to like. Once Power went down into that subterranean domain, the Adventures of Power soared into the pantheon of low-budget, high-value legend. I'm going to watch the Adventures of Power again and again just to make sure that I don't miss a beat.",1384560000,,760,4.359154929577465
