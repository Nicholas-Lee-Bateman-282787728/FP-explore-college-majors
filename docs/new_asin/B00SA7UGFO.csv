One of the great things about the invention of video and now DVDs is that movie fans can be exposed to so much more than they ever thought possible. Movies that we loved and adored while growing up can now become part of our collections. On an international level we now have the opportunity to watch movies from foreign countries that we might never have heard of or been exposed to otherwise. In some cases thats not always a good thing but when a great movie comes your way it makes it a joy to watch.

That was the case when I sat down to watch MASSACRE GUN. This Japanese film made in 1967 comes to us from Arrow Video in a pristine blu-ray release thats a joy to watch. The movie opens with a hitman for a local crime lord who is ordered to kill the love of his life. He follows orders but then decides hes had enough and quits his criminal ways. But one does not make a decision like that without suffering the consequences.

Not long after he begins having problems at the club he owns. When his younger brother, an up and coming boxer, decides to follow suit, the boss has his men break his hands ending his boxing career. Enough is enough and the hitman along with his two other brothers decide to take on the boss head on, hitting several of his businesses and telling them they now answer to them. Unwilling to go down without a fight the battle is on between these two factions.

Along with this battle is the fact that the boss right hand man is the hitmans long time best friend. Eventually the two will have to face off at some point. Just who will win, who will be loyal to which organization and what will be the end isn't revealed until the last moments of the film.

Shot in glorious black and white the movie makes the best use of light and shadow seen in some time. While the film is in Japanese with subtitles the acting doesnt lose a thing in the process. Anyone who doesnt take the time to give this one a watch if you have it available is losing out on a solid movie from Japan that deserves to be seen.

Arrow Video again delivers a great edition of the film as well as several interesting extras. Included in those are an interview with star Jo Shishido, an interview with critic/historian Tony Rayns, the theatrical trailer, a gallery of images and a booklet on the film. Give this one a watch, you won't be disappointed.",1438300800,,2406,4.311946902654867
8697920,3,B00SA7UGFO,"A solid '60s Nikkatsu yakuza film, but it didn't quite click with me. I'm a big fan of Hasebe's later work, and this is definitely a bit more violent than other yakuza films I've seen from the 1960s. If you like these films it's worth getting. The packaging is beautiful and the transfer looks fine to me. However it's a bit pricey and if you can afford it and are new to the genre, I enjoyed the films in Nikkatsu Noir boxset more than Massacre Gun.",1432684800,2,450,4.244186046511628

8697923,4,B00SA7UGFO,"Genre icon J Shishido stars in this tense 1967 Japanese yakuza tale from Seijun Suzukis former assistant, director Yasuharu Hasebe. More conventional in structure and storytelling than another 1967 film starring J Shishido, the acclaimed Branded To Kill, Massacre Gun owes much to earlier American film noir. Produced by Nikkatsu, this movie is a relatively straightforward gangster story presented in stark black and white. Despite its sinister sounding name, Massacre Gun would have fit in quite well as a Hollywood mob film from the 1950s. The Japanese film would probably be forgotten today if not for J Shishidos memorable starring turn.

Kuroda (J Shishido) is a hitman asked to kill his mistress by his boss. The powerful Akazawa runs the criminal gang by fear and intimidation. Kuroda follows Akazawas orders and kills his mistress. That decision leads Kurodas brothers, Saburo and Eiji, to stand up against Akazawas gang. Saburo, a promising young boxer, has his career cut short by Akazawa for opposing the powerful man. Their involvement makes Kurodas decision to leave the gang much easier.

Massacre Gun (other translations have called it Slaughter Gun) is steeped in film noir, its shadowy style owes much to the genre. Its such a conventional yakuza film that Western audiences will have no problem picking up its beats and themes. The story could have come from an earlier Hollywood period without much trouble. What makes it worth seeing is J Shishido, the Steve McQueen of Japanese b-films. The Japanese actor is the epitome of cool with his stylish acting.

The genre film is a solid gangster tale in black and white. A distinctive instrumental score with jazz leanings and very interesting cinematography make it a stylish success. Veterans of the genre will find much to like about Massacre Gun.

The new film transfer from Arrow Video is a fine effort if you can make allowances for the splicing errors found on the film elements. Screenshots and more:

8697924,3,B00SA7UGFO,"Arrow USA presents Massacre Gun, restored in glorious black and white. The A/V transfer is excellent and shows that care was put into restoring this title. Bit rate is nearly maxed out most of the time between 33-37mbps. There are some extras, but they are a bit light compared to other Arrow sets. 15 page booklet and reversible artwork included. Note this is a limited edition 3000 unit release.

The movie is good but I would not say top of its class. Still, worth a buy if you can get a good price on this Blu-ray.

And herein is why my review is 3-stars instead of 5-stars. I feel the price on this is too high at $39.99 msrp considering the type of content when other cult labels are putting out similar content for 24.99 - 29.99 msrp - $10 to $15 less. Thus, while the movie is good as is the transfer, I cannot fully recommend this title due to the poor value for the price. Arrow just seems to be about $10 too expensive compare to its myriad of US cult competitors. Perhaps this will change when Arrow gets more US experience.

Recommended, if and only if the price ever drops to a reasonable level.",1428278400,4,1109,4.3478260869565215
