I have almost all of monica bellucci movies this one is the worst not only does she have small part but the movie is not very well written, or directed",1488499200,,321,4.366666666666666

7960841,2,B000065B0K,"Four intersting European actors save the film from being forgettable.  They are Monica Bellucci (for whom most of the viewers visit this page), Donimique Pinon (regular in French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet's films), Tcheky Karyo, and Michel Muller ('Wasabi').

'Like a Fish out of Water' is a French caper film intended to be comical, violent, and thrilling at the same time.  The story is just OK, about the three crooks who tricks one timid French middle-aged guy 'Desire' (Muller) into a scam.  The three ---  Karyo as leader BB, Bellucci as femme fatale, and Pinon as trigger-happy handyman -- want to get a fish.  In fact, it's a very expensive one, so they need a specialist to convince the owner, who happens to be a big boss in underworld.

The rest of the film is about their plans, which are original at one place -- it's 'fish out of water' so here's certainly one originality.  All I can say is that Monica Bellucci plays the important role in it.  And it doesn't happen many times, but she is supposed to be playing a comical role.

In spite of well-drawn characters supported by good acting, the film lacks pace and rhythmn.  The caper is not thrilling enough, the gags are not funny enough, and most uncomfortable thing is its sudden introduction of violence.  One character is beaten by Pinon's character without any apparent reason but he was offended.  The characters suddenly start to drop dead at the certain point of the film, and they leave no impression on us whatsoever, as if their presence is cut abruptly short simply because the film does not need them any more.

One thing about Monica Bellucci.  I may be mistaken, but she has seldom (or never) smiled on screen after she gained her international fame.  In this film, she tries to show her different side, but because of her character, or perhaps her acting, Ms. Bellucci (whose character's truths I won't disclose here) remains very aloof, or sometimes slightly icy.  In this film, she surely laughs, if not smiles.  But I have never seen her smiling anywhere else.

For those who are interested in gifted actors in Europe, or caper film in European situation, this film is a good choice.  But the story is mediocre, and the direction slack for all good acting.",1112140800,3,2243,4.731958762886598
7960842,3,B000065B0K,"If you are watching this, I guess it is highly likely that you are interesed in Monica Bellucci, like me.  She is as stunning as ever in this movie, BUT not as sexy as in Malena, or as 'exposed' as in Irreversible.
Otherwise, I would say this is only a so-so movie.  The story is interesting, but I think it just can be better (either more funny or more violent).
The worst part of this DVD is its quality - the color quality is like fade painting...very disappointing.",1064361600,9,469,4.318181818181818
7960843,3,B000065B0K,"an enjoyable hybrid, drama-comedy (although a tad flawed)
the plot..
an aging con man known as B.B (tcheky karyo), and his partner, Myrtille (monica bellucci), persuade a lovesick sap named Desire Poilvin (michel muller) to help them steal a rare fish from a wealthy collector.
their accomplice (dominique pinon), however,turns their planned caper into a bloodbath.
___________________________________
great cinematography, some scenes have a monotoned color,the ensemble is visualy impressive..especialy for this genre.
the cast:
is really brilliant,..there's dominique pinon (better known for his previous films such as Amelie, Delicatessen , the city o the lost children, foutaises etc...), surprisingly, there's also monica bellucci,(she rarely plays in comedies),she and michel muller steals the show.
there's also a personal fav of mine , Tcheky karyo (La femme nikita , the king is dancing , My life so far , the dobermann , the bear, BLUEBERRY....etc..).
and a cameo apearnce from Jose Garcia (trouble every day , beaumarchais the scoundrel, jet set , le boulet..etc)
overall, the acting is great,(sort of hysterical in some scenes), but the problem with this film is the constent mood/change,the story constently jumps between your average comedy to a dead serious drama.
ultimately ""a fish out of the water"", is not very memorable..but its still worth watching.
the dvd version of ""like a fish out of the water"", contains only two different possibilities..[play] and [chapter selection]
