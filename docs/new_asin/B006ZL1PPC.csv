8506949,4,B006ZL1PPC,"I found this 8 Horror films 2 discs set in the five dollar bin at my local Walmart. I already own three of the movies, Puppet Master, The Prophecy II, and Halloween: Resurrection, but I bought the DVD for one other movie called Wes Craven Presents: Dracula III: Legacy.

Dracula III is better than Dracula II. The plot isn't great, but there is enough vampire bloody scenes and nudity to make any any horror fan happy.

The other four movies on the set are Roman, The Nurse, Live Animals, and Paranormal Entity.

Roman stars Lucky McKee (who normally directs) as a shy social outcast who accidentally kills a girl (played by Kristen Bell) that he has a crush on. He keeps her body on ice in his bathtub. His depressed life changes when a strange woman becomes interested in him. This is an odd little movie. When it first starts you can easily tell that it is an low-budget film with bad camera work and lighting. I almost pushed the stop button, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad that I did. It is a strange movie, more of a thriller than a horror film. I actually felt sorry for Roman!

The Nurse is a low-budget ripoff of The Hand That Rocked the Cradle. The movie was released to direct-to-video (aka VHS) in the late 90s and thanks for Echo Bridge Home Entertainment for releasing it to DVD, I bought the movie in an eight movie bundle. I didn't know what to expect when I saw Lisa Zane's name in the opening credits as I never cared for her in Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, but she gave a good performance as a psycho nurse. The movie is less horror and more like a made-for-TV thriller, except it has a few f-bombs in it. The Nurse isn't really scary, but I was entertained for 90 minutes!

Live Animals is about a group of young adults who are kidnapped and tortured by a group of psychos, who plan on selling them to the highest bidder. The movie is a ripoff of the Hostel movies and the Saw films. It has a low-budget, bad acting, and plot holes every two minutes. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

I couldn't get through Paranormal Entity as it was so badly written, acted, and directed. I have seen several movies from The ASYLUM and this is their worst movie! The movie is a mockbuster of Paranormal Activity. Avoid this movie at all cost!

As for the three movies that I already own, The Prophecy II is the best with Christopher Walken returning as the fallen angel. This time he is after a woman and her unborn child, who happens to be part angel. It's not as good the first, but it is the best out of the sequels.

Andre Toulon's demonic puppets make their first screen debut in The Puppet Master, which isn't the best in the series as the pacing is a little slow, but it is fun to watch.

The Halloween movies are my favorite out of the horror genre, and Halloween: Resurrection happens to be my least favorite, except for the first fifteen minutes with Jamie Lee Curtis, then the movie goes to hell. I give the director credit for doing the best he could with a horrible script.

Despite a few unwatchable movies, I'm satisfied with the 2 disc set.",1347321600,3,3076,4.371278458844133
8506950,4,B006ZL1PPC,"Eight movies for this amount of money makes you realize you'll not be getting all terrific classic Horror.  I paid only five bucks elsewhere.  However, you do get the original ""Puppet Master"" with Paul LeMat and creepy voiced William Hickey.  I mostly wanted Wes Craven's ""Dracula III:Legacy"" which is decently acted by Jason Lee, Roy Schneider and Rutger Hauer.  The rest are:  ""Halloween Resurrection,""  ""The Prophecy II"", ""The Nurse"",  ""Live Animals,""  ""Roman,"" and ""Paranormal Entity"".  (These movies have people I've never heard of, but Jamie Lee Curtis walks thru ""Halloween"" for a sec).  If you want to know who stars in these other movies or what they're about I'm sure they're listed on the IMDB website.

I'm keeping mine for the two movies mentioned.",1339027200,5,761,5.056451612903226
