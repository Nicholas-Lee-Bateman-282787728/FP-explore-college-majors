4401822,3,B004LONZIA,"The credits for this title are inaccurate.  Chris Pinto (who directed ""A Lamp in the Dark"" and other titles) is NOT the director of this work.  The work does not have the same creative production elements to it that are normally expected in Pinto's productions.",1373587200,,261,4.777777777777778
4401823,1,B004LONZIA,"Mary is God's mother - respect that. It is Satan who, being jealous of God, copies his mass. God won over Satan and threw him in hell where Satan is a loser. This book was obviously written with the intention of misleading people.",1369872000,4,230,4.372093023255814
4401824,1,B004LONZIA,"You'd have thought the evangelical world would have learned after the embarrassments that were Mike Warnke and John Todd, but alas, no.

Parlaying a 1987 visit on Oprah (the same diligent vetter who gave her benediction to James ""Million Easy Pieces"" Frey) into a 1989 visit on Geraldo (downward mobility is still mobility, I guess), Mr. Marquis has found a niche playing on the conspiracy fears of evangelicals and fundamentalists. Here, he turns his fear-stoking skills on to a faded, but still remunerative, target--phobias about the Roman Whore.

Marquis (whose given name is Joseph, but I guess that might come across as too mackerel-snappery here) basically disinters the work of Alexander Hislop, tarts it up for those disinclined to read, and stretches it into four hours of howlingly funny historical and other factual errors. All delivered in the same unctuously low-key manner that convinces the gullible that it must be scholarly.

His credibility problems are legion (rimshot!), not so by the way. But if you want to spend $40 bucks unironically, causing you to look at your Catholic neighbors like Young Goodman Brown looked at his wife after his night ride, Doc will thank you all the way to the bank. And he would be happy to send you another catalog of paranoia-stoking fun, no doubt.

4401825,1,B004LONZIA,"There is nothing even resembling Catholicism in this video! What a joke. The United States (allegedly) guarantees freedom of religion - and therefore, I suppose, that includes Satanism. What this video IS is standard Catholic-bashing, based on absolute lies and total ignorance. Questioning even one of the supposed ""facts"" of this dvd must quickly lead one to realize that the entire video is nonsense. The one-man-show creator and actor is a Satanist. Satan hates God, Jesus, Mary and the Catholic Church. If you believe in anything resembling Judeo-Christianity, this has to be self-evident. This is a video by Satan, against Mary. If this is the best he (Satan) can do, I feel even more sorry for him than I did before!",1353369600,7,723,4.983471074380165
4401826,1,B004LONZIA,"I don't know what horrifies me more, that Amazon is willing to sell this drivel as if the man has a legitimate argument, or that he subtitled this ""Mother of Harlots"". To call the Virgin Mary a harlot is about as brutal a violation of everything that she was as you can get.",1343347200,12,274,4.188679245283019
4401827,1,B004LONZIA,"Catholics do not worship Mary, they honor her as Jesus' mother, in imitation of Christ who honors her as  required by commandment along with Joseph.  Catholics are very open about what they believe (CatholicAnswers), although many of the lay may do a poor job of explaining it, if one takes the time to learn and obviously this work has taken little time to learn the truth.  There are no secret ceremonies or secret societies in the Catholic Church.  To be sure the Catholic Church has issues with abuse by some clergy and its poor handling of that situation and rejecting these types in the seminary.  It has also had a handful of popes who while keeping the apostolic doctrines straight, got carried away with themselves in their personal lives.  But to attack Catholics as some black magic organization shows the ignorance that perpetuates into the 21st century all the way from the 1st century.  I would give this work zero stars, but the lowest I can rate it is one.",1341273600,13,972,4.682352941176471
4401828,1,B004LONZIA,"Are you kidding me? The Catholic Mass is identical to the Black Mass?  Last time I checked it was the Satan worshippers who were stealing the Consecrated Host(Jesus' Body), and then using it in their own mass to desecrate God. And anyone who knows Catholicism, nobody is ""worshipping"" the Blessed Virgin Mary, they are honoring her, as well as the Saints and Angels in Heaven with God our Father and His son Jesus.  I guess having Heavenly Heros and Role Models are a bad thing, maybe it's better to stick to movie stars and athletes?
Save your money.  Don't buy this garbage.",1333756800,33,576,4.627450980392157
4401829,1,B004LONZIA,"The only thing this DVD proves is the author's ignorance of Catholicism.  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage.  It is full of inaccuracies and lies.  The title alone contains a common misconception that non-Catholics have of Catholics, which only shows that this author twists facts to suit his own agenda.  Catholics do not, and never have, ""worshipped"" Mary; they honor her as the mother of Jesus, just as they honor their own mothers.",1317859200,94,448,4.855263157894737
8434543,5,B004LONZIA,"Great dvd. Every dvd  I've gotten by this guy has been very good. Even though I already know a lot about this  subject ( Semiramis , Nimrod and Tammuz) I learned even more. Also' I  learned about a lot of similarities between the Catholic mass and Occult mass. I didn't know that much about this occult mass stuff going in.",1502928000,2,323,4.35
8434544,5,B004LONZIA,This dvd is well iformative . I saw part one of the series and this completes it. I wonder if there is going to be a part three?,1478649600,2,128,3.607142857142857
8434545,5,B004LONZIA,"It's funny when people get exposed they get mad the proof is in the pudding. The Pope is not God nor his son Jesus Chris or in place of neither. He is no God this video among so many others are in fact just that""FACTS"". Where at in the bible does it tell you to confess your sins unto man""Priests"". Then these guys get caught haveing sexual relationships with young boys. Come on! Give me a break the bible clearly teaches to abstain from all evil,idolatry,false god worship and many more. Doc Marquis has done an excellent job of exposing this false religion as Jesus Christ attended. The Roman let's you sin then come back and confess to man. Man cannot forgive sins only the son of the living God""Jesus Christ"" can forgive sin. That alone tells you it's a false religion a priest or a cardinal will burn in Hell if they themselves do not repent""1 John 1:9"".""TRUTH HURTS""!",1460764800,3,874,4.46875
8434546,1,B004LONZIA,What a pack of lies.  Obviously this doc marquis has only reasearched his own side of the argument as the Catechism cancels out any bit of trash this heathen pile of tinder can through.,1458432000,,185,4.4411764705882355

8434549,4,B004LONZIA,"A lot of great research put together in a simple picture presentation for anyone that appreciates information that can enrich their knowledge and  understanding of a subject that they would not necessarily be willing to devote a lot of their time to. It is obvious that this title will receive negative reviews from any catholic, but if you are seeking knowledge and have an open mind, you will most likely benefit from this DVD even though it is not the best presentation out there as far as documentaries go. What is not so obvious is why would a catholic purchase this DVD and waste time with something they are predetermined to dismiss anyway. I will look up more DVDs from Doc Marquis as it is apparent a lot of hard work was done to research this subject.",1420416000,3,761,4.554744525547445
8434550,1,B004LONZIA,Really? A witch at 18?  On Oprah.  That's all you need to know that this is a bunch of garbage.,1410825600,6,95,3.7
8434551,1,B004LONZIA,"Most of these so-called exposs come from the same source and are bought by the same self polluters hoping to find some sordid details about women confessing their sexual sins, or finding one more scandal to use against their Catholic neighbors and relatives.  The real history of Catholicism is far more interesting,  and surprising, than any of this fiction. We have scandals far more scandalous than a bunch of TV evangelists who ""like to watch"" other people have sex, going all the way back to Judas' betrayal and Peter's denial.  Jesus said there will always be scandal.

You should buy Robert Barron's videos instead of any of this kind of trash.",1406505600,3,651,4.837837837837838
8434552,5,B004LONZIA,"If anyone has been disturbed, distressed, and/or outraged by this video, they really need to ask themselves why that is?  Peeling away layers of deception is painful, but so very necessary.

Doc presents his case clearly, firmly...yet gently.  He is not out to hurt people, but to inform and enlighten them.  He knows that of which he speaks.  Becoming defensive and angry - and certainly name-calling - are not sufficient arguments against the truth of what Doc has said.

I urge any and all who want to discover the real origins of the RCC to watch this dvd.  It is critically important to know what the Truth is - or you're going to fall for the lie.",1393459200,8,653,4.52991452991453
