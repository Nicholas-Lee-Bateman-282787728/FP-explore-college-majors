8614421,3,B00FCAK2M4,"imv / blueline is the company that makes this.  I was hesitant to order as their last willie dvd was bloody awful -- and to make matters worse they either lied -- or were wrong inadvertantly about the recording date.  this time there was no recording date listed.  I do NOT believe this is a willie approved product.  I think it's another attempt to cash in on the superstar by taking previously released material and adding a modern day willie nelson cover.  little background information included.  the songs and content is good.  however i'm trying to find the title this content was previously released under.  17.99 is a lot of money these days for a single dvd release.  amazon is not discounting the price as of yet.  im happy to have it and again it's good performances of classic willie.  but I honestly believe this is NOT new stuff -- but again REPACKAGED material.  I give it a B on content and a F onoverall importance --so that equals maybe a C- or so.  and that leads me to say finally ; ""it's all so-so"".",1386374400,4,1020,4.448648648648649
