7672820,5,B01C6S28TY,"Cross Ange is an absolutely amazing anime. It is violent, and it is dark; definitely not for the feint of heart. That being said, it is also quite fun at times, with excellent action, and contrary to popular belief, there is a fantastic story arc happening throughout. The characters and the transformations they all undergo are fantastic, and there is a profound sense of poetic justice throughout. Those who have it coming to them ALWAYS get their comeuppance in the end, including the heroes.

If you've heard terrible things about this show, it wouldn't surprise me. My only recommendation would be to the more sensitive viewers, to tough it out through the first few episodes (Episodes I will note I had zero issue with. If you don't expect the type of situations the first episodes provide in an anime, you have a curtain pulled over your eyes) and your patience will be rewarded.",1468281600,16,886,4.790849673202614
7672821,5,B01C6S28TY,"On the positive side, It has a tremendous story to tell. The ""Norma,"" of which Ange is one of them could symbolize, Jews, Blacks, Homosexuals, and so on who are often depicted as outcasts, sub human, and have faced discrimination and persecution in societies around the world for the simple reason that they were born different.  The kingdom that Ange came from was depicted as racist in this show. Ange, who was a princess in this kingdom judged and condemned Norma as well, until she  found out that she was a Norma as well. After that, Her life became a living hell.
On the negative side, this program contains excessive violence nudity, sex, and many people might be offended by the content, definitely not meant for kids to watch.
But in spite of it's negative points, I found it to be an excellent show.  People who seek social justice and human rights in this world will relate to this story. Justice is fought for and Justice is won.",1467504000,10,941,4.589285714285714
7672822,5,B01C6S28TY,"I watched the whole series on Anime Network Online. It was excellent! I'm not sure why no one previously gave this 5 stars. Great character development, lots of action and cool creature designs. While I suggest at least 14 and up, it does have something for everyone. The ending is a surprise. If you like action/adventure/romance, just buy this and set 2.",1467244800,2,356,4.758064516129032
7672823,1,B01C6S28TY,"waist of money about sex, rape and nudity.  The story has no real plot.  The only reason people like this is for it's violent behavior toward women and paints men as hungry sex bulls.  Very disappointed with this series.  I watched the whole thing and think it is all fan service based. I can not give this anime a good rating because real anime is artistic and has story telling techniques.",1467158400,3,391,4.464788732394366
7672824,3,B01C6S28TY,This is what I hate about some anime coming out with this mature rating and they erase the nipples. Why? Are we suppose to believe the women on this planet don't have nipples? It looks stupid and immature. Won't buy the second series.,1466812800,4,234,4.465116279069767
7672825,3,B01C6S28TY,"The best way to summarize Cross Ange's first set, without spoiling the big reveal later on.
Racist princess from a magic using kingdom is revealed to be one of those who she is told to hate and is exiled, has to fight dragons on a gundam, and gives everyone attitude. Even those who want to be her friend. Ange hates everyone pretty much. Tons of fanservice happens, and it's pretty much anything you can think of.

First off.. the rating is for the first set. Not the series as a whole.
I love Cross Ange. But I almost dropped it while it was streaming. Why?
Cross Ange was full of fanservice early on, I mean like all the time. I'm a girl. I don't care for that stuff. So for me, it took away from the show. I watched this, expecting a show with an awesome female lead and a bunch of cool female characters, with the fanservice to be akin to Escaflowne or Gundam Wing aka none. I was way wrong, at least with the fanservice. I guess it's a standard of mecha shows these days, which stinks. Another thing that did bother me (but to a lesser extent) was Ange's attitude problem. It did get annoying early on. She was racist and spoiled, and it did get grating. Though that was the point (to show what kind of people the mana users largely are), it didn't make it fun to watch. It was kind of frustrating, watching the main character treat everyone else like garbage without letting up. Luckily, she DOES get past this, and grows as a character. But it takes until episode 8 or so. This does NOT mean the show is unwatchable, though. It is tolerable until episode 7 or so, when the fanservice and Ange's attitude finally will get to you and you'll want to drop this. Do NOT drop it, though. Just deal with it, and you will be rewarded. The fanservice does die down (it doesn't disappear, just gets lessened. And when it does appear, there is actually a reason). There is character development. Ange becomes awesome, and not just as a DRAGON slaying loner. You just have to deal with one episode more than you'd want to to get to it.

I gave the set three of five stars because while Ange being racist and spoiled and the fanservice got grating (and made this show embarrassing to watch >_<), there are still several good episodes on this set, and as a whole, this show is good. It is worth the money.",1466121600,20,2299,4.344186046511628
7672826,4,B01C6S28TY,"Cross Ange wasn't what I was expecting as this was an impulse buy simply because the synopsis on the back sounded good. I thought this was going to be a revenge series where the former Princess Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi, Ange, went about her business to exact revenge on her brother. What I got was basically Gundam fighting dragons with plenty of fan service. However, these are kiddy fan service in that while there's plenty of nudity, there's no nipples, but they've got plenty of naked rears to go sound. It's not a bad series and it did keep me watching but the first set kind of ended on a cliff hanger.

This series is confusing to me as I think they wanted a mature theme with some revenge factor involved but then there's too much nudity in it. However, if they wanted to make it like High School DXD, then the nudity was just too kiddy and should have included nipples as it's just weird to me the amount of nudity in each episode but it's not true nudity.

Overall, I enjoyed it and will buy the next set just too finish it out. So I'm giving it 4 stars as it's an average anime but I really like the character and mecha designs. I also like that they didn't make Ange sometime who is dumb.",1464739200,5,1201,4.3097345132743365
7672827,5,B01C6S28TY,"Exactly as advertised. Came well packaged and right on time.

There is 'fan service'; however I find this anime to be a worthy one to watch: I have seen no other with such a visceral portrayal of true oppression. These girls have absolutely no rights, and are used as mamelukes against vicious foes to preserve the very system which subjugates them.",1488153600,,349,4.721311475409836

7672829,5,B01C6S28TY,"- Synopsis: Enter a world of hypocrisy and discrimination. Our heroine becomes the very target of discrimination that she non-chalantly gave out to others. Having lived a sheltered life, her life turns into a living nightmare as she soon comes to understand that reality is harsh and unrelenting.

As such, she ends up being exiled on an island where they spend the rest of their lives fighting and dying for the very people that exiled them in the first place. At first, she wanted to end her miserable life as she found no point in her existence. Until seeing some of her comrades brutally and painfully dying, she resolves to herself that death is frightening and wants no part in it. Rather, she will be the winner; not the loser. Tune in to find out how Ange struggles through life.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: There's a lot of content in here that may be too much for many viewers to handle. Mainly due to the amount of fan-service and yuri-like (lesbian) situations in this anime. As such, this anime should only be for those that are used to the ecchi genre. However, it should be noted that the mechas are interesting and cool. The violence is reasonable. It isn't Attack on Titan, but does have a moderate amount of blood and gore. If you are a relatively open-minded viewer, this will be an enjoyable experience.

- Analysis: This anime shows the viewer that the real world isn't sunshine and flowers. It's a rough world with discrimination, prejudice, hypocrisy, injustice, and other various concepts. If you cannot learn to adapt, you will be eaten alive. A perspective that reinforces the survival of the fittest mentality. Furthermore, while there are plenty of people that cruise through life, a majority of others struggle each and every agonizing day, just as the characters of this anime do. This adds how relevant it can be to reality.

Moreover, this anime emphasizes that many people often live sheltered or otherwise a peacefully ignorant life while others suffer elsewhere. Not only that, but people take many things for granted. This anime addresses that people enjoy their peaceful lives while other people fight hard, and often are unrecognized for their efforts. Soldiers would probably fit this description. Or other professions that might be considered noble. This is one of many painful lessons that is engraved onto Ange: both physically and mentally.

Another relatively common but overlooked concept is that life heavily revolves on relationships and interactions. While Ange resolved herself to being a lone wolf; at some point, she realizes that working as a team is the best way for combat effectiveness, as well as a way to make a harsh reality that much more tolerable. Unless you are someone who can live off the land, humans need and thrive off the relationships and social interactions of others.

- Conclusion: If you don't care much for ecchi or fan-service in general, I would stay away (but isn't that most animes). Still, Ange is one fine piece of work, as she isn't your typical heroine. She used to be a sheltered princess, but as the anime progresses, she becomes the kind of person that will slit your throat or put a bullet in your head without a second thought. Reality often will change a person.

Also, this anime details many things in life that aren't pretty. Mature viewers might be able to appreciate this series more than those that only see it as an anime with just fan-service. Due to the amount of violence and yuri-like situations, I only recommend this anime for mature viewers. It also helps to be open-minded.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-ray discs with a run-time of about 5 hours. Rated TV-MA for violence, blood and gore, and strong sexual content.

7672834,4,B01C6S28TY,"So it's a Mecha anime with a Blue Gender flair.  I am largely indifferent one way or the other, but someone should tell the Japanese that breasts usually have nipples.  It is darker than I thought it would be, like a lot darker.  End of Master of Martial Hearts dark..9******  I was expecting a cutsy fun type of anime and I am getting a hard boiled prison for women (of all ages) type of anime.  When they aren't piloting the robots against dragons they are acting like it is an all girls school doing a off broadway reproduction of Caged Heat.  Without nipples.

Fanservice rating 1 being Spirited Away and 10 being Queens Blade:
7 (would be a 9 if it had nipples)",1471046400,10,666,4.365853658536586
7672835,5,B01C6S28TY,"CA1 is so good I don't think I can review it properly without spoiling something or running on so long no one will want to read it. I truly could not get enough and cannot wait to watch part 2. My *ONLY* complaint is that I do wish the artwork had been tweaked a bit for the BD/DVD release. Not because I'm dying one more set of animated nipples. There are a million series available for fan service and ecchi fulfilling boob-a-thons.

Nonetheless, on occasion, and especially amidst some truly remarkable artwork, a big, blank, flesh colored ""orb"" with nothing blocking it (or censoring a nude scene) simply looks ridiculous. And that takes a huge focus off everything else that's going on, simply because it looks corny and out of place. With all the limits this series pushes (and man oh MAN, does it ever!!) I can't believe they got ""skittish"" over drawing a frickin' boob. Like I said, just silly - specifically in this series. In many others it wouldn't make a bit of difference, frankly.

All boobs aside however, this series is utterly gorgeous, filled with rambunctious action, awesome fighting, and a slew of powerhouse chicks kicking every bit of a$$ they can get their hands on. And in my opinion, Cross Ange is an absolute must have for any collection.",1470009600,4,1265,4.668161434977579

8752413,3,B01C6S28TY,"This set is good, but too much of the story winds up being ""well, that didn't really work so why don't we make magic or if magic won't work, majik, and if that doesn't work let's babble pseudo-science terms and hope the audience didn't pay attention in school"" to bridge the problem spots.

Giant flying suits with swords and guns and blasters--  and DRAGONS, wow, dragons, so if you like that, this one should go to the top of your list.

If people actually acting like people, people working like people, that kind of stuff matters, well, two thirds of the time the story gets it right.  That, for the math impaired, that means it did it right two out of three times, but missed the mark one out of three times.  To me, that is just too big a miss, but good artwork and a lot of good story with a bunch of bad glitches still winds up twenty five episodes more or less worth watching.",1530921600,,885,4.275449101796407
