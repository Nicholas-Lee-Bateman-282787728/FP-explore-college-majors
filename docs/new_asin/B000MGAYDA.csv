2730908,1,B000MGAYDA,"I may be wrong, but it seems to me that somehow--and don't ask me how--people who hate opera are now producing many operas.  Take this offering of ""Hoffman,"" for example.  As a previous reviewer opined, this staging is ""ugly throughout.""  I concur most emphatically.  It's like the point of this DVD is to convince people that ""Tales of Hoffman"" sucks.  But why?  Is it some kind of conspiracy to destroy Western Civilization?  I don't get it.  However, one thing is certain:  this production goes out of its way to descerate this most wondrous music.  They have taken all of the fun out of it.  Two examples.

First, one of my all-time favorite jams is the opening of the ""Olympia"" scene, which consists of one of the catchiest melodies I've ever heard, somewhere between a march and a procession.  (This theme is repeated twice in the act, to great effect.)  Put it this way:  I can't believe anybody doesn't like it.  Not only that, this brief introduction sets the tone for the entire act.  This is not surprising since the music is, after all, the introduction to the scene.  So, of course, in this DVD, this great music is not even in the opera.  These brainiacs took it out!

Here's the second example.  During Olympia's show-stopper, when she winds-down the second time, she has to be wound-up again.  So Cochenille gets on the floor, shoves a key way under and up her dress, causing Olympia to moan with delight.  Thankfully, nobody humped her.  Also, during her aria, one of the most annoying Spalanzanis ever (he was kind of a lame impersonation of Einstein), kept buzzing around her with his remote control device.

Oh, and another thing, this Hoffman is a hunchback, or is, at least, hunch-back-like.",1267833600,10,1713,4.725423728813559
2730909,5,B000MGAYDA,"Whether Hoffmann is an incarnation of Kleinzach or no, this production is fantastic!  I enjoyed the singing from start to finish with no weak links in the cast.  Hoffmann with a twist seems to be the norm anyway.  I've seen five versions and every one is different.  So who's to say which take on Hoffmann is valid?  I frankly don't care.  Call me shallow.  Hoffmann is a drunken poet and here he is a hunchback, too.

In this version, Nicklausse, who is the Muse in disguise, has a much larger role in events than I've seen before.  It is played by Katherine Goeldner, who declares right away that SHE loves Hoffmann and that she will win him from the others.  In the end, she does.  Meanwhile, the entire cast sings and acts superbly.  The simple set suffices for all the stories and the action flows right along; Giuletta literally rises out of the hulk of Olympia.

Aquiles Machado's voice is gorgeous; Milagros Poblador is perfect as Olympia; Valentina Kutzarova was a luscious Giuletta; Maria Bayo finds her fortissimo as Antonia; Christophe Fel is wonderful as Crespel; Konstantin Gorny was a great series of villains--with Dr. Miracle particularly dramatic and intense; Jose Ruiz played multiple roles winning applause.  And on and on.  I'm not kidding...everyone was great.

Don't let me forget the orchestra, conducted by Alain Guingal.  The music was glorious.

I recommend this production whole-heartedly!!!",1209772800,13,1419,4.965957446808511
2730910,2,B000MGAYDA,"Hoffmann, the central figure in this opera, may be a drunk, a loser in love, and a paranoid personality, but at the same time, it's clear from the libretto he's a romantic poet, and the world IS against him. For whatever complex of reasons, though, - soprano Maria Bayo in the interviews is heard muttering some nonsense about Freud - Hoffmann, according to director Giancarlo Del Monaco's ugly and unsuitable ""bright"" idea for the part, is portrayed as a demented hunchback, more Kleinzach than any recognizable Hoffmann, given the libretto.

The production strives to be novel and ugly throughout, and in this aim, I'm sorry to say, it largely succeeds. The only saving graces are the very voices of Machado (Hoffmann), Goeldner (Muse), and, above all, Poblador (Olympia), the stunning and believable automaton. In the area of voice itself fortunately, the star director found one place where he was unable to tamper and maim.",1183852800,20,928,5.025974025974026

8168621,5,B000MGAYDA,"The voices are excellent on the ""streamed  version"" of Les Contes d'Hoffmann we have just watched tonight.  We didn't mind that Hoffman was physically deformed in this version---the voice transcends his physical and character flaws.  Perhaps it was a way of reminding the viewer that he was quite flawed.

We were very pleased to run across this opera as it has long been a favorite of ours and found both the acting and voices were excellent.  With some hunting on the internet we found that the very version we are watching is soon to arrive at our doorstep.

Excellent versions of this opera were mounted in both San Diego and Seattle in the late 1970s.  I was privileged to see both.  In the San Diego Opera performance, Dr. Miracle played a GLASS  violin with a green ""glow"" inside as he urged Antonia to sing until her heart stopped---- at which time the violin exploded!  (have no idea how this was accomplished).  It took an hour or so for us to come back to earth. Wow!

8168623,3,B000MGAYDA,"This dvd includes an extra 20 min worth of music over most of the others. The best of this is in the Olympia and Antonia acts (Violin aria best). The Met performance from late 2009 includes these  (check to see if you have it on your dvr). Neither has a Gedda or Domingo in the lead role which would improve things (Joseph Calleja  on the met perf pretty good, however). Jose Van Dam on the Toulouse disk is great as the villains, but this is a hard one to find. Most of the critics rate Naouri as the best performer on the current disk, which may be true. Of recent reviews, Opera News is not too hot on it. Bbcmusic is in the middle. Fanfare, however, rates it tops among the current dvd ""Hoffmanns"" today. The Mag reviews are all over the place on the individual performers. Incidentally, I have seen both Domingo & Gedda on the stage in this opera..Perhaps, the best idea would be to buy this as a supplement to whatever you have.

8168624,4,B000MGAYDA,"Eratos release of this 2013 PRODUCTION of Offenbachs ""Les contes dHoffmann"" from the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Laurent Pellys staging is something of a landmark. It is the first commercial video release to be based on the now extensively revised Michael Kaye edition since 1993, when the Opra de Lyons adaptation (Des contes dHoffmann) was issued on VHS and laser disc (now out of print, though used copies are available). However, the Lyon version from the early 90s was clearly not representative of the edition, because most of the rediscovered music that makes this edition so important was cut, various numbers were moved around by the stage director and his controversial dramaturg, and a great deal of license was taken with the text.

While there are still several textual problems and some disappointing omissions in the performing version devised by Pelly and his equally faulty dramaturg, most people who watch the video of this production will be hearing a lot of authentic music that Offenbach composed for this opera, which may be unfamiliar to them. That, in turn, provides a much better sense of what Offenbach and his librettist, Jules Barbier, achieved. All in all, this video documents a fine performance.

Some of unfamiliar passages are rarities or first recordings, consisting of several early versions of arias rejected by Offenbach and later replaced by the more familiar definitive versions. It is a great treat hearing them so well sung here, notably: the first version of a radiantly beautiful romance ("" rve de joie"") and a comic aria (""Voyez-la sous son evantail"") for Nicklausse in the Olympia act, both masterfully sung by mezzo-soprano Michle Losier. Later in the opera, instead of performing Offenbachs definitive Tourne, tourne miroir or the apocryphal Scintille diamant, Pelly chose to have Dapertutto sing Offenbachs very first version of that aria (""Rpands tes feux dans lair"") to attract Giulietta, deftly sung by Laurent Naouri.

Most importantly, viewers of this DVD will be able to see the Giulietta act, albeit incomplete here, in a version that somewhat follows the original scenario penned by Offenbach and Barbier. One wonders why they didn't just perform all of it and why they omitted Giuliettas great coloratura seduction aria (Lamour, lui dit la belle, vos yeux tait fermes). Dramaturg Agathe Mlinands pompous claim to having re-written the Giulietta Act for this production is very bogus. All she did was re-phrase some of the spoken dialogue and make very nasty unwelcome cuts!

Having said that, a major reason for owning this DVD is that it includes most of Offenbachs original final scene of the Giulietta act, which is altogether different from the rather feeble, anti-climactic  traditional version of the opera. But again, Pellys deconstruction is problematic, inexplicably changing Barbiers lyrics and altering the denouement (all stemming from the first time he did this production in Lausanne). Nevertheless, most of the music is there and the dramatic punch it provides is as visceral as it was when Offenbach penned it shortly before he died. It is dark, disturbing, and brilliant ,and deserves to be heardpreferably, in a less adulterated form. Uncut, the final scene is only slightly more than 6 minutes. Why couldn't they have respected what we now know Offenbach actually wrote and do all of it?

Despite these problems, Pellys directing is precise and vibrant, bringing with it some extremely original good ideas deserving of praise and admiration. Opting for a rather minimalist approach, Pelly manages to accomplish, through light and shadow (how appropriate for the Giulietta act!) something akin to German expressionist cinema. The feeling is real and appropriate for a work that is just beginning to be taken seriously as a much more coherent and meaningful ""Tales of Hoffmann"" than the opera our parents or grandparents would have known.

Michael Spyres Hoffmann is just what that character needs to be: vulnerable, desperate, and sympathetic. Michle Losier turns the dual role of La Muse and Nicklausse into a tour-de-force, so necessary now that we understand the importance of these characters as Offenbach conceived them. Kathleen Kim has all the coloratura technique to bring off Olympia (and a flying Olympia at that), but Tatiana Pavlovskayas voice is far too dark for Giulietta. Often erroneously cast as a mezzo-soprano, Offenbachs original score calls for a Giulietta who is also a coloratura soprano (not surprising, considering that all four of the heroine roles were intended to be sung by the same artist, the versatile Adle Isaac).

The star of the show is, of course, Natalie Dessay who doesnt disappoint. Cast as Antonia rather than her usual Olympia (and much anticipated Giulietta), one can get a sense of what it would have been like had Dessay been able to sing all of the heroines. She could have done it handily ten years ago, but, alas, it is now too late.  Her husband, Laurent Naouri, is magnificently devilish as the four villains and seems to relish these roles. Its really music he was born to sing, and, in my opinion, he does so to perfection.

In and of itself, this is a brilliant performance of the opera and can be highly recommended on its own merits. So if you love this opera, do yourself a favor and buy this set; despite its flaws, it is well worth having.",1394409600,12,5368,5.069082672706681
8168625,3,B000MGAYDA,"When I first read of this Erato release I was hopeful that it would be vocally and dramatically superior to the issue on BelAir. After all it had mostly a Francophone cast and Spyres had demonstrated via some clips on YouTube that he had a good sense of French style. Kim, of course is not French but Olympia suffers less in this regard than other roles. .

No, most of the problem lies in the fact that the composer died before he completed the opera and the edition that has been standard in most operas is acknowledged now after considerable research to be far from what Offenbach probably intended. First the German musicologist Fritz Oeser had a go at it and subsequently Michael Kaye took it on. It is my understanding that it is Kaye""s version that was the basis of the Erato CD version with Alagna.  Initially Offenbach offered the opus to the Opera but they declined; subsequently it was offered to the Comique which accepted it. As a result dialogue had to be part of the score and the three female roles were to be sung by Adele Issac, a stalwart member of the Comique and a coloratura. It should be noted that the Erato CD edition has cast Sumi Jo as Giuletta and there is no dialogue. The opera is longer and darker than the corrupt Choudons edition; it should also be noted that two CD recordings (one on EMI the other on Phlips) that preceded the Erato recording had incorporated some of the ""new"" findings. What we have then is a situation similar to Don Carlo. The musical director, not having anything resembling the ""ur"" text must make decisions as to how he (or she) wants to mount the opera. Use the familiar Choudons edition or attempt some kind of amalgamation of what is now available.

The notes for this new taping are miserable, the sort provided be Kultur and Virgin. A cast list and all the relevant individuals has been provided.  . A woman by the name of Agathe Melimand is responsible for the new libretto (!). It should be noted that there is dialogue in this edition and fortunately with the abundance of Francophone speakers there is no jarring transition. Does it move the plot along? Does it provide pertinent narrative details? Hard to say. Almost at every point this DVD is trumped by the BelAir edition. Neither provide a coloratura for Giuletta but the soprano. Maria Riccarda Wessling for BelAir is far superior to Tatiana Pavlovskaya for Erato. The latter is a voice of littlie distiinction and that may be the reason for the brevity of the act. Since the famous aria for Dapertutto (not by Offenbach) is omitted the bass-baritone has a different ""diamond"" aria to sing. This aria is also used in the BelAir tapiing. Giuletta is given short shrift by both editions but even more so in the Erato, perhaps because of the singer's technique--or lack of it. It all ends abruptly, while the BelAir edition provides a concerted number which may or may not be spurious but is satisfying musically and dramatically.

What of the other singers and I am afraid that I must draw comparisons to the BelAir edition. Kim is a good Olympis faltering only on the accuti which are shrill and abrasive. Perhaps this is the result of the taping and not evident in the house. Petibon on the BelAir is a superior singer and gives a better performance even though she is required to wear a body stocking which makes her appear nude. In fact there is probably more nudity in this performance than in any other opera I have on DVD. So if it offends you...........Natalie Dessay is a truly charismatic artist and her departure from the operatic stage is sad but inevitable considering her waning resources. She is however able to portray a touching Antonia. (Her Violetta from Aix is a far better  tribute to her talents and would be the disc that I would choose to remember her by.) On BelAir the Antonia is Rachel Harnisch. Perhaps somewhat generic but fresh voiced and up to the demands of the role. And what of our titular hero? Michael Spyres is blessed with a good sense of French style. The role is now very long and one has the feeling that it is taxing him to the limit. BelAir offers a tenor from Belgium, Marc Laho whose only other document is a Conte Ory from Glyndebourne; the colorature taxes him but he makes a valiant effort but he is not Juan Diego Florez. Hoffman is another kettle of fish. The voice is more serviceable than beautiful but he does have the notes and the measure of the role. Laurent Naouri (with gothic nail polish and kohl rimmed eyelids) is the very essense of malevolence. Alas he is frequently somewhat unsteady of tone and line. but like his wife he is a charismatic performer. On BelAir the nemisis is sung by Nicolas Cavallier who may not evoke the sense of evil and hatred for Hoffman that Naouri does but he sings with more beauty and evenness of tone--something not to be scoffed at. The one vocalist who consistently sings with distinction is Michele Losier, Nicklausse. In the Choudons edition the role is little more than a comprimario, but now she is clearly a major player and it is wonderful to hear her music sung with great authority and style. BelAir offers Stella Doufexis; She may not be gifted with as lush a voice as Losier but she is very good.

The Erato set if directed by Laurent Pelly. I would never have guessed it had that information not been provided. It is monochromatic; everything is gray. But it is ""traditional"" if that term means anything anymore. The only offender is the Giuletta act which is utterly lacking in any evocation of Venice--no canal. nor is regie  evident here. The Bel Air edition is directed by Oliver Py. As I have indicated there is consierable flesh evident and there are no ""real"" sets in the sense that one is doubtless used to. Panels and various shapes all with lights are moved with great ease; Platforms have been erected to allow for action to play on more than one level. Since there are many scenes both productions are able to move with speed for scene changes. This is clearly the City of Light, not Munich or Venice

In the Erato taping the conductor is new to me,Stephane Deneve. I presume he is French and he moves the music along with Galiic brio, much like Nagano in the aforementioned CD. The BelAir production comes by way the Geneva and has the Suisse Romande, conducted by Patrick Davin in an excellent performance. Geneva may not be Paris but it trumps (marginially) Barcelona.

I should add that the BelAir performance is not more informative as regards the edition than the Erato even though the booklet gives the appearance of being informative. There is the cast and the story and an excerpt from the booklet provided by the theatre for attendees. It is called The Party is Over and is written by Py. It is not without interest but in such a work that only exists in part, it would have been useful to elaborate what and why choices were made. It is  similar to Boris in which the composer made more than one version.. Don Carlo exists similarly. I love the opera, having seen it at the age of fourteen and owned the set that was recorded shortly after WWII. It was the Choudons version but my God the singing of the three sopranos. and even the Hoffman, Raoul Jobin. Cluytens conducts. It is a benchmark performance even if the edition should be discarded. The singiing overrides all.",1391644800,13,7321,4.589449541284404
8168626,4,B000MGAYDA,"I bought this opera for several reasons: first, it will be Natalie Dessay's last opera recording, since she announced her retirement after this performance. Dessay has been an exceptional performer, being gifted with excellent acting skills, as well as an extended and agile coloratura voice. Second, I wanted to see what Laurent Pelly, a director whose work I generally like, would do with Hoffman. Like most, if not all opera performances, it has strengths as well as weaknesses.

I have heard Michael Spyres (Hoffman) but primarily in Rossini, where his extended range and flexible technique brought splendid results. Dramatically, he is spot on; his portrayal of the alcholic poet with serious relationship issues is near perfect. Vocally, however, Hoffman ain't Rossini; there are extended lines that hit squarely on the passagio, the point where the voice shifts from chest to head registers, and, consequently, is at its most vulnerable. By the end of the opera, there is noticible fatigue to the point where he sounds strained and looks exhausted.

Dessay didn't sound like retirement was on her mind. She was clearly watching what she did, but the role of Antonia, whose illness will kill her if she sings was a good choice for Dessay's exit from opera and she made the most of it. There was no sign of the problems that plagued her in the recent Met Traviata.

Laurent Nouri (the four villains) is dramatically the real deal, and he can sing almost as well in the part as Bryn Terfel in the now-deleted TDK version or Konstantin Gorny in the Opus Arte version. Nontheless he makes the villains out to be diabolically bad.

Michele Losier is a good Nicluasse/Muse. She takes a while to warm up, but when she does shes quite good, but with a tendency to get shrill on top. Susanne Mentzer in the TDK version is hands down the best on disc, though.

Kathlees Kim is an awesone Olympia. Light but with no volume issues, she scales the vocal peaks (pun intended) flawlessly.

The rest of the performers do very well with no disappoitments. So does the chorus with lots of interaction, which makes the dramatics more credible.

Pelly's staging is ... busy There's a lot of scenery shifted during the active performance, and it distracts from time to time, primarily because there are no obvious dramatic reasons for the shifts, unless it's in Pelly's mind. But Hoffman has such a bizzare plot overall that most of what Pelly does works. Costumes are 19th century.

There has been quite a lot of musical scholarship focused on various editions of Hoffman with some buzz about newly discovered music which was included in this performance. An ""extra feature"" on the making of this opera would have been useful from that perspective, but, alas! there are no extras.

Picture is good, but oddly, only 5.1 sound was an option with no DTS available.

The TDK version with Shicoff as a passionate Hoffman is still my favorite DVD. It's available from some Amazon sellers at a very nice price and is being re-released (at leat in Europe) on the Art Haus label.",1391385600,13,3056,4.826003824091778
8168627,4,B000MGAYDA,"This is re-release of a performance originally released by Opus Arte in 2007. I reviewed it last March and here is what I wrote:

""It must be me, but this is my second DVD of Hoffman, the first being the now deleted performance on TDK with Shicoff and Terfel. Both suffered from largely poor reviews ... except mine. I am usually very strong in maintaining the traditional in staging, and both Hoffmans are anything but traditional, but even if there is a strong emphasis on the negative aspects of Hoffman's failures in romance in Giancarlo Del Monaco's staging, it works for me...

My main reason for buying this disc (aside from the price of under $10.00!!) was to see and hear tenor Aquiles Machado, whom I have enjoyed in DVD performances of Elisir and Rigoletto do the demanding role of Hoffman (it IS demanding, btw; just listen to the Act II aria with its extended passagio singing). Machado is typical in appearance to the roly poly tenors Italy used to produce in large numbers years ago (Machado is, of course, Venezuelan). But the incomparable Richard Tucker and Carlo Bergonzi had similar physiques and similar but different vocal skills. I am very satisfied with Machado's work here; it is first rate singing and not bad acting, although the staging of his character is a bit too negative, even though Hoffman is an alchoholic and romantically dysfunctional!

I was pleasantly surprised by the other singers, all but one of whom (Maria Bayao) were new to me. Konstantin Gorny (Lindorf et. al.) almost blew my socks off with his ""Scintille diamont"" aria, which was both enormous and resonant. Katherine Goeldner was both vocally splendid and highly animated as the Muse disguised as Nicklaus. Milagros Poblador simply has to be seen (and heard!!) as Olympia; stupendous! Maria Bayao does a very good job with the role of Antonia, but at least from my perspective, she is not quite as good as the other female leads.

Orchestra and chorus under Alain Guignal do very well. Disc quality is first rate both as to sound and picture. Subtitle abound and extra features include interviews with some cast members.

In sum then, gentle reader, I found this to be a good Hoffman, with so-so staging and often phenominal singing. As a total package, I like it and will enjoy playing it again in the future.""

I think it is approriate to note that my reservations about the staging mainly relate to the portrayal of Hoffman as Kleinzac, the hunchback of whom Hoffman sings in the beginning of the opera. It becomes dark and disquieting as the opera progresses. However, the approach is valid and one must decide for onesself. I note that the Opus Arte copy is still available but at a much higher price than this edition, which is priced rather attractively and is likely to be more so when Amzon sellers discount it.",1380758400,8,2819,4.766393442622951

In a long ago time, studio recordings of operas on LP and, later, CD were all that opera lovers had, especially folks like me who live where live opera ain't.

8168629,1,B000MGAYDA,"The musical portion is competent and worthy, but in a dvd this is not enough. The other aspects of the production suck.  Visual and aesthetic ugliness is sought after, as is the case in other recent dvd conceptions of this opera.  As one earlier reviewer noted, these are conscious (or  unconscious) attempts to cheapen and deform western civilization.

Hoffman's soaring romantic idealism is built into his adoring arias, and this predominant nobility must be the cornerstone of any dvd production.  Tragedy and futility doom his hopes, but this is are concealed from him by the strength of his illusions.  His well intentioned purity is crushed underfoot by a world that is cynical or, as in the world of Antonia, dominated by idiots and charlatans.  His nobility and sincerity are non-negotiable features of the opera.  Rise  up and throw cushions at the screen when he is portrayed as a drunken sot with oatmeal for brains, lurching around and waving a bottle.  His weakness is that he over idealizes.  He locates beauty and trust in his phantasms, making him easy prey for those he (wrongly) worships.  Again, in the world of Antonia, even music conspires against him --- and here I can't help thinking that Offenbach is being autobiographical and lamenting that he composed so many operettas about love, instead of excelling at it himself in real life.  Wasn't Offenbach's own muse (music) a consolation prize for all the Stellas he didn't know how to approach personally and so he had to accept the success of being a composer of frou-frou operettas instead?  Fortunately, there's a dvd performance that keeps the priorities in line.  Amazon.co.uk has it for 4.99 in the PAL Area 2 format, playable in America only on a dedicated multi-regional player, and also for $33.89 in the Amazon.com listing.
