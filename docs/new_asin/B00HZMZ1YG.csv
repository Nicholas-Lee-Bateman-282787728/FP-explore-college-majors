6244281,5,B00HZMZ1YG,My Saturday morning childhood can be shared with my children.  They don't make shows like this anymore.,1428192000,2,103,5.0588235294117645

6244283,4,B00HZMZ1YG,"OK, so I was searching for 80's cartoons and ran across this set. But there are no specifics as to what is included. So I looked a little more and found out the contents of this set.
Disc 1:
Care Bears: Episodes 1-3
The Get Along Gang: Episodes 1-3
The Littles: Episodes 1-3
Disc 2:
Dennis The Menace Episodes 1-3
Heathcliff Episodes 67,78& 86
Little Clowns Of Happytown Episodes 1-3
Nellie The Elephant Episodes 1-2 + 2 Bonus Episodes

Apparently, the two ""bonus episodes"" are 2 more episodes of Nellie the Elephant.
Personally, I prefer the Warner Bros. set of 80's cartoons, because it features 11 different shows, most of which, I feel, were better shows. But if you are a fan of these particular shows, it's not a bad mix either. And for under $10, there are worse things you could get.",1427155200,8,791,4.531468531468532

6244286,2,B00HZMZ1YG,There isn't a play all option on the menu. After every episode it returns to the menu and you have to press play for the next episode to start.,1458000000,2,143,3.9655172413793105
