8575724,5,B00BYVLE2W,Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are one of a kind when it comes to both the conductor and the members of the symphony orchestra. The Mozart Symphony here is very spritely and lively. Solti brings out the best in the symphony. The Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 4 is a very unique symphony of his in that it employs some unusual instruments in the orchestra at various parts. This Tchaikovsky is a real delight to have in ones musical library.,1426118400,,445,4.6455696202531644
8575725,5,B00BYVLE2W,"I was a subscriber to the CSO during the Solti years and heard him very frequently.  I saw this particular performance on TV many years ago and jumped at the chance to own it.  It is Solti at his best, particularly in the Tchiakovsky 4th.  At the end of the last movement, he is drenched in perspiration and gasping for air--that's how intense this performance is.  Don't miss it!",1369785600,3,380,4.463768115942029
