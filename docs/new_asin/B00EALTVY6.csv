5899722,5,B00EALTVY6,"This DVD contains six episodes from the My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic series, including:

1. Look Before You Sleep
2. Winter Wrap Up
3. Too Many Pinkie Pies
4. Wonderbolts Academy
5. Apple Family Reunion
6. Keep Calm and Flutter On

The problem I have here is that Too Many Pinkies was already released in an earlier movie. I would think they would know what they already released and have chosen a different episode to include on this DVD. Other than that, it's cute and teaches young children the values of friendship and believing in yourself. Great Buy :)",1405036800,3,564,4.63

5899726,5,B00EALTVY6,"Great design, cute characters, good storylines and excellent animation.  My 2nd graders sometimes get to watch movies at lunchtime as a reward.  We watched it this week and they LOVED it!  It was my first time watching it and I quite enjoyed it,too. The story we watched involved Rainbow Dash entering flight school, 'Top Gun' style.  There seem to enough little touches for adults to keep it entertaining.",1394755200,,406,4.926470588235294
