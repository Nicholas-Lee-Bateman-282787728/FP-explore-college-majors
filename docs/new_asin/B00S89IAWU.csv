The dynamic between John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara as their relationship grows is touching and very well done.  Add to that the gorgeous scenes of rural Ireland, the great story line and score and the charming character played so masterfully by Barry Fitzgerald, and you have a true classic, which is wonderfully directed and delivered.  It only gets better with each viewing, as you realize and rediscover the layers of meaning, life lessons and culture wrapped within.",1442620800,,537,4.933333333333334

6964022,4,B00S89IAWU,"I grew up in the days when John Wayne was perhaps the most looked up to actor on the planet. His portrayal of the deep rooted American hero was what represented us to the world and his popularity was among the largest found for any movie star. While most will associate him only with westerns it was one of his most personal films that I still count among the best he ever made. THE QUIET MAN involved a location far from the west or even America, taking place in Ireland. And until now the difficulties in making that film were not that well known. This documentary takes care of correcting that loss of information.

The movie goes back and forth from talking about the effects the movie had on the small town in Ireland where it was made to the struggle that Ford had in bringing the film to fruition. It was a 20 year journey that he made in an attempt to bring the world he was born in to light on the silver screen and it wasn't an easy trek. The career that he built in the U.S. helped garner him enough power that he was able to do it and in the end the result not only further established him as an amazing director, it won him a best director Oscar and was nominated for best picture that year. The movie was a blockbuster and has become heralded as one of his best.

The story of the movie itself involved a boxer (Wayne) retired from the ring for reasons unknown as we start, who returns to the home of his birth to take over the family land. He meets a fiery redhead (Maureen OHara), falls in love and wants to marry. Unfortunately her stubborn brother (Victor McLaglen) does his best to keep the two apart. The eventual showdown between the men ends the movie in what was one of the funniest and longest running fight scenes in movies.

But the movie was more than just a story of ill-fated lovers. It was a love story of the land of Ireland itself as told by one of its sons. It was a way of bringing his homeland to the screen for all to see how lovely it was, how simple life was for him as a boy that had Ford so willing to risk as much as possible to make this film. All of those struggles, from simply getting the studio to allow him to make the film to funding to finding just the right people to fill out the roles, is what makes this documentary so fascinating.

In addition to the story of Ford, as I mentioned earlier, we get to see the location he shot the film in today along with memories of it being made shared by some who were there. Certain stores in the film may not have been what they were depicted as in the movie but theyve retained the names and signs used for fans of the film that visit now. There is even an appreciation group that gathers to celebrate the film in this town.

In the end this is an entertaining film that not only reveals what went on behind the scenes but encourages you to go out and find the movie to watch all over again. I have little doubt that in so doing those who have seen the movie will fall in love with it once again while those who have never been exposed will find themselves drawn into the story, amazed at the performances of all involved. Not only does this documentary remind us of this classic film, it lets us know that with determination all things are possible.",1433894400,2,3242,4.205787781350482
6964023,4,B00S89IAWU,"A warm loving tribute to John Ford, the making of ""The Quiet Man"" and to Ireland.
For ""Quiet Man"" fans, probably the ultimate companion piece to the movie with clips from the film (could have been more pristine), knowledgeable comments from directors Martin Scorsese, Jim Sheridan and Peter Bogdanovich,  Professor William Dowling and noted Ford biographer Joseph McBride.  A revisit to many of the original locations especially the town of Cong which substituted for the film's ""Innisfree"" including meeting some of the townsfolk who worked on the film and others who remember when ""Hollywood came to town.""
The saga of how John Ford battled for more than twenty years to achieve his love ode  to his ancestral home of Connemara and his eventual shrewd deal with Herbert J. Yates (head of Republic Pictures) is well documented  and Pappy's cranky quirkiness is lovingly recounted, especially by star Maureen O'Hara.
Lots of little things about the film regularly pop up to surprise and delight all those who love the film, especially those of us who have more than an ample share of the green running through our veins.
There are a number of bonus materials included as extras on the disc although there is nothing particularly significant except for an extended O'Hara interview.
For those interested in learning more about  ""The Quiet Man"", may I suggest the fascinating, superbly researched  book ""The Complete Guide to The Quiet Man"" by Des MacHale (briefly seen in the documentary, hosting a bus tour of the sites) and published by The Appletree Press in Belfast. A large scale book filled with comprehensive detail on every aspect of the film including the pre-expanded version of Maurice Walsh's original story, more than 150 photos and maps, interviews and a unique minute by minute timing of all the scenes.  If you love the film, this is a must have book and well worth searching second hand bookshops or specialist cinema and Irish shops for.  Also note that MacHale is spelt McHale in the documentary.",1432425600,5,2014,4.991044776119403
6964024,5,B00S89IAWU,I had this on VHS & wanted it on DVD as I love this movie classic.,1431907200,,66,3.1875
6964025,5,B00S89IAWU,"This documentary is filled with insights into the making of The Quiet Man and takes us to the Irish town that was the setting for the movie.
Terrific interviews with Maureen O'Hara (with bits that didn't make it into the film retained as special features), Martin Scorsese, Aissa Wayne (one of John Wayne's daughters) and more.

One pleasant surprise was an interpretation of the film by Professor William Dowling of Rutgers University.

One part that stands out for me is the story behind the filming of the ""confession scene"" where Mary Kate is talking to Father Lonergan while he's trying to fish.  Finally being able to watch that scene with English subtitles was worth the price of the Blu-Ray to me.

If you enjoy the Quiet Man I think that you'll enjoy this documentary.

Keep in mind that some of the clips in the Special Features are better measured in seconds.  This is reasonable because they are edits from the documentary that someone thought worth preserving.  Some are better than others but it is what it is.

Some of the Irish residents being interviewed could have used some subtitles as well since they had very substantial accents.

The clips of The Quiet Man used in the documentary have some serious technical issues of blurring and color saturation issues but since they only complement the story it didn't bother me all that much.

Oh, I almost forgot that when I saw the Main Menu for the first time, there's a little cottage in the middle that I swore must have been an Easter Egg.  Not the case",1431734400,7,1521,4.680451127819549

6964032,4,B00S89IAWU,"Great documentary. Informative and well done. Great background on John Ford and the impact and influence it had on the making of the movie. Wonderful interviews with Maureen O'Hara, family members of the stars, and even some of the locals from Cong. My only gripe (and why the 4 stars) is that they used old clips from the movie which a fuzzy/blurry. They just remastered it for the 60th anniversary (a GREAT job) so I don't understand why they didn't use that version for the clips. I'm even seeing some lines during some of the clips. Has anybody else experience this? Still worth purchasing.

5/3/15 update: I believe the older clips are used because based on what I read, this documentary was made in 2010 before the remastered edition was released. I also contacted Olive Films in regards to the ""freezing"" during the old clips. It's been well over a week and still nothing from Olive. During that time I returned my original and received a replacement with the same issue. Hope Olive corrects this problem.",1429660800,10,1012,4.75
