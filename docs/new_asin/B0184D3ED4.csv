This is one of those very cool nourish type of movies that takes place just before WW2. Takes place in shanghai, Duh. Shanghai is split into many factions and areas for many countries. don't stray too far or you are in the Japan sector etc. Spies and rebels are everywhere and John Cusack has come to China to find out what happened to his best friend. He sees things and winds up getting involved in a lot of bad stuff. This predominantly Chinese Cast is outstanding, Gong Li, Ken Watanabe and Chow Yun Fat are amazing. Everytime you turn around you get more and more intrigue and I love this suspense. Which by the way is non-stop thru this movie. I'm sure you can find it cheaper but it is very worth the viewing.",1492473600,,858,4.40251572327044
8741367,4,B0184D3ED4,"I thoroughly loved this movie, but was distressed by the fact that the conversations in Chinese are not subtitled at all, much less in English.  I am certain the translations of these many conversations would have added a great deal of insight into the story.  Can this be resolved at all??",1460332800,,290,4.666666666666667

8741371,5,B0184D3ED4,"Simply marvelous 40's era period film placed in Shanghai prior to United States entry into WWII via Pearl Harbor. Story of American spy who comes to Shanghai to investigate the death of a fellow spy and friend, then gets caught up in Chinese - Japanese struggles and intrigues taking place, including other foreign nationals based in Shanghai of the time, and, of course involvement with a beautiful Chinese woman working with the Chinese underground. Suspense, intrigue, romance, war, betrayal, murder, what more do you need in a movie.
Wonderful cinematography, and terrific sets and locations that realistically portray Shanghai in 40's. John, Cusack, Li Gong, Yun-Fat Chow, Ken Watanabe, and even a supporting role by Hugh Bonneville, provide top drawer performance. If you find Casablanca, Black Book, and other similar war-mystery-murder to your liking at all, this will certainly entertain.",1449619200,9,897,5.414285714285715
