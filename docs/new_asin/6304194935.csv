816822,5,6304194935,"Action movie with excellent cast, and strong action-comedy content.

Little sexuality, plenty of action.",1173657600,,104,6.428571428571429
816823,3,6304194935,"HOLLOW POINT is a pretty routine action shoot em up, but it's keen sense of humor and its sharp performances elevate it to a much better than average thriller.

Tia Carrere and Thomas Ian Griffith play sparring government adversaries out to stop a nefarious money launderer.  Their romantic battling is reminiscent of MOONLIGHTING although a little more physical.  Carrere uses her stunning beauty quite well and Griffith is very funny as an egotistical morphine popping agent.  But the real stars of the film are veterans John Lithgow as the aforesaid villain and Donald Sutherland, just having a grand old time as a morally conscious assassin.  Veteran director Sidney J Furie keeps the action moving with a funny climax with our four stars all pointing guns at each other.  Not a classic but good entertainment.",1160006400,7,814,5.037313432835821
816824,5,6304194935,"I may be partial to Thomas Ian Griffith but this movie was great. What made it great was its sense of humor. There are countless movies similar to this.. but they take themselves too seriously and therefore, fail. ""Hollow Point"", however, has a pretty good plot with unique characters. Not to mention really funny parts (like Griffith and the garage door). I must say that Thomas Ian Griffith should do more comedic roles because he really clicks.",1106352000,,447,4.818181818181818
816825,5,6304194935,"This is without a doubt the highlight of Thomas Ian Griffith's career. His performance in this movie shows his excellent comic timing as well as capacity for genuine emotive subtleties. Donald Sutherland, John Lithgow and Tia Carrere round out the cast of excellent performers. The script is expertly written, the highlight being Griffith's consumption of a sandwich. Highly reccommended to fans of T.I.G. This film is far superior to Crackerjack and Timecop 2, both of which waste many of Griffith's unique talents.",1100131200,,516,5.304878048780488
816826,5,6304194935,"I saw this movie for the first time on hbo because in argentina it went straight to video stores, and I thought it was amazing! Donald Sutherland plays his roll gracefuly and John Lithgow is a perfect cold blooded villain. I finally got it on dvd and the extra features are very good too.",1090627200,,288,4.351851851851852
816827,5,6304194935,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, from start to finish.  Although there were some VERY unbelievable parts, it was well worth watching. In fact, I had to rewind certain parts again & again, (garage door scenes) and I laughed  so hard I cried!  Donald Sutherland makes an almost loveable asassin, &  T. Griffith & T. Carrerre sizzle!  Never would've thought to involve  guns in romantic foreplay, but they pull it off!  Gotta own this one!",950400000,5,434,4.863013698630137
816828,5,6304194935,"Thomas Ian Griffith plays super-action tough guy who also seconds as comedian and thirds as hopeless romantic in the hillarious action-thriller. Tia Carrere, Donald Sutherland, and John Lithgow are all magnificent  supporting casts. Not sure if this ever made the big screen but it should  have. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes high-action flicks  with excellent plots. It's one of my favorite movies...even my wife loved  it!",944265600,8,444,5.3
816829,5,6304194935,Hollow point is a combination of action and humour. The cat and mouse game between Carrera and Griffith added to the enjoyment of the movie.  Sutherland was a devious and witty character and Lithgow made an excellent  bad guy! I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie!,943315200,2,268,4.933333333333334
816830,4,6304194935,"Hollow point is a movie full of good quotes both from Donald Sutherland and Thomas I. Griffith and both men did some good acting. It is a kind of movie which you'd want to watch over and over every time you needed  cheering up. Overall, I advise everyone to give it a go.",933552000,2,271,4.113207547169812

The DVD functioned Ok. The movie however did nothing but drag along. Very boring movie. Not worth the DVD it is recorded on. I guess the movie title say's it all ""HOLLOW POINT"". There is no point to this movie.",1324684800,,278,5.780487804878049
816999,4,6304194935,"It's just a funny TV-Actionmovie with the famous & lovely Tia!
But the secret little highlight of this movie are the bad guys:John Lithgow & Donald Sutherland!
Okay,it isn't the best work of Tia,John & Donald,but it's nice entertainment!",1323043200,,237,5.102564102564102
817000,5,6304194935,Thomas ian griffith is why I bought this movie he shows off this humor side with some fight sences All in all I liked this movie alot pretty good acting by the cast,1286323200,2,164,4.0
817001,5,6304194935,Love this movie!  Donald Sutherland is hilarious. Delivery was prompt and the came in perfect condition.,1284681600,,104,5.5
817002,4,6304194935,"This movie is good. Not an oscar worthy, but, otherwise good enough film. There are moments where you will think ""Yeah, like only one squad car is going to show up after a huge mafia shoot-out."" Or. ""Why are the mob-bosses running away instead of halting their own henchmen's fire."". But, hey, the acting is good. The overall story is decent, and I love Donald Sutherlands witty sense of humor. All in all a satisfying movie.",1268179200,,425,4.605263157894737
817003,4,6304194935,"""Hollow Point"" is an surprisingly successful mix of action and comedy. The story is nothing special but there's plenty of action scenes and manyy funny scenes, and it's also helped by a good cast. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrere make a good team and John Lithgow a good villain, but Donald Sutherland really steals the show as a hitman. This is a perfect movie to turn off your brain and have fun for 100 minutes.",1234828800,3,417,4.5
817004,1,6304194935,"We are movie buffs. I own over 1,000 DVD's. I buy based on my interests, recommendations, and Amazon reviews. So the generally positive reviews for an action movie featuring well-known actors (even though, movie buff that I am, I had never heard of this movie) prompted me to buy it.

We could not get through more than twenty minutes of it before I asked my wife if she wanted to cut our losses and shut it off. She gratefully  agreed.

God! What dreck this is. Who are these people who loved this movie and told us all about it on Amazon? My faith in collective wisdom is shattered.",1198800000,3,584,4.388888888888889
817005,4,6304194935,"David Suchet conveys his usual fine performance as Hercule Poirot in this quality Agatha Christie mystery.

While not the very pinnacle of the Suchet series, ""The Hollow"" still stays pretty close to the book version of the story: A philandering and prominent London physician visits friends along with his wife at an aristocratic country estate where eccentric, rich friends live. His mistress, a sculptural artist, is also on the scene for the weekend. The mistress also has another admirer on hand who is quite jealous of her doctor-boyfriend.

Yet another major suspect (did I mention that the doctor gets murdered? *.* ) shows up for the weekend soiree, an actress lover from the past who wants to get her clutches back into the doctor. In any event, as I said, the doctor gets snuffed (shot) and his wife is found standing over his body, holding the possible murder weapon, a revolver, in her hand!

And it just so happens that Poirot is vacationing in a nearby bungalow and has been invited to the estate to play ""The Murder Game"" -- yes, a bit of a tired theme, but it wasn't so much when Christie wrote it. Can the great Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, get the doctor's wife off the hook???? You'll have to view the film/DVD to find out.

The great cinematography of the spectacular locations is one of the superior features of this film. The story is a good one but not Christie's best. At least, in this instance, the story is coherently told.

I would definitely recommend buying this DVD for Christie fans -- others might enjoy watching it at least once.",1198368000,3,1569,4.711678832116788
817006,5,6304194935,"I thought this movie was fantastic, All the actors did a superb job,  and hey the comments that Max and Diane have towards each other are great.  I havewatched it over and over again.  I would highly recommend it, butthen I am a big fan of all the actors esp. Griffith, Tia  the best scenes were the bar, his mouth wide open while she is talking dirty, when they shoot each other, her talking to herself while he is driving the cop car, and her place in the kitchen, and the very end at the shooting at their feet and then the kissing.  WOW..",1190332800,3,542,4.173076923076923
817007,5,6304194935,"Say what you will, this movie's awesome.  Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrere may never have hit the A list as actors, but in this movie they're great.  Donal Sutherland as the psychotic pyromaniac assassin is hysterical.  John Lithgow as the megalomaniacal madman bent on world domination is totally believable... okay, maybe not but I already used ""hysterical"" in this review.

Bottom line, if you like a good time and don't want to be bothered by excessive drama and pathos, this is the movie for you.",1178409600,3,504,4.825581395348837
7865780,1,6304194935,"Oh, boy.  Bad acting, bad music, bad storyline that goes on and on for ever.  Perfect woman with perfect boyfriend witnesses and identifies a killer.  All goes wrong in the court system and so lots of music and threats and phone calls.  After 1 hour of this, I turned it off.  Either bad guy or the perfect woman will win.  At this point, I don't care.",1524355200,,352,4.257575757575758
7865781,3,6304194935,"I think this movie is getting mixed up with another one...  Probably because this movie also goes under ""In Self Defense:...  Donal Sutherland wasn't in this flick...

Overall, this is a relatively slow moving movie of a woman who witnessed a killer and is asked to testify...  and is then terrorized by him and his buddies...

I will say Billy Drago plays a creepy villain as always, and was probably the best part of the movie...

All in all though, it's slow moving and could practically be like a lifetime / a&e channel movie...  although I guess maybe it's a ""little"" too intense for those channels...  but not by much...",1522108800,,626,4.627272727272727
