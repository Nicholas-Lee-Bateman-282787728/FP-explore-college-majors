This was my first dvd purchase from ANIMEIGO studios. These are the fine folks who licensed this Japanese classic for release and well, I'm just glad that we got a release in America. The DVD is fairly barebones, but that's to be expected of DVD's from this time period (2005 holy cow just how old am I now 'o_O?)

The DVD contains 4 episodes, ""Thrilling Summer Date"", ""So long Byebye Summer Days"", ""Panic in Typhoon!"" and the infamous ""Drunkards Boogie."" I chose this dvd in particular because I adore the 1st and 4th episodes from this collection (and also because mine was fairly cheap). 4 episodes was pretty standards for DVD's of the era, and even today they can't really squeeze more than 7 or 8 onto one standard dvd disk, and since I bought this one for a fairly cheap price I can't really kick up a fuss.

The presentation on the disk isn't great, the definition is standard but once again this was a product of the 90's, transferred to early dvd's, they could've done worse. There's also no english dub. ANIMEIGO attempted one early on I'm told, but it was pretty quick to bomb so they just switched over to subs, which I have to say I'm completely fine with.

The packaging is interesting and amusing. Kurama, whose featured on the cover has nothing to do with these four episodes, she never appears in fact. It's just window dressing but the real kicked for me was the phrase printed on the back ""Urusei Yatsura: Proof that the Japanese are Weirder than we are."" I laughed for about a good minute and a half.

Overall, this isn't the most stellar DVD set, I would love season sets but since ANIMEIGO no longer holds the license I find it perfectly acceptable to settle for these 4 episode sets, hey it could be worse.",1452556800,,1776,4.5233644859813085
8156864,5,6302661137,"The first part ""Raging Sherbet"" is my all time favorite movie! I grew up with this watching it in Japanese with no subtitles and I still loved it even if I  didn't understand all the words. Great movie to recommend but I would let the kids watch it because there is some nudity for a brief moment here and there. The second part of the movie ""I howl at the Moon"" is very cute and sweet but not as great as raging sherbet.",1180483200,,421,4.072289156626506
8156865,3,6302661137,"This OVA is one story about alternative realities.  The story was almost there, but the, ""what if's"" in the infinite universes were too shallow to convince me.  The jokes just were not there like they are in the  TV series.  This movie is still good, just slower moving than other Urusei  Yatsura stuff.  If you are out of anime to buy, pick this up.  It is better  than nothing.",960768000,,379,4.391304347826087
