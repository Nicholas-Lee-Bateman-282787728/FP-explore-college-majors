8307239,5,B001GVJYI6,My husband is a huge fan of this type of DVD. I purchased it on a lark thinking that he would enjoy it. He absolutely loves it. In fact he has watched it several times already. The picture quality is great and the filming and history is fantastic. I found myself glued to the show as well.,1357776000,,289,4.087719298245614
