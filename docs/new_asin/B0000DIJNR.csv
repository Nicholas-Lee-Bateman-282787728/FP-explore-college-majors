1925502,4,B0000DIJNR,"Jeff's Collie, what a journey to 50's America life.  Different from the latter ""Timmy Episodes"" this series were so real and so down to earth.  Lassie wasn't constantly ""discovering dinamite"" nor ""saving the whole community"" but it was a truly believable intelligent dog that was easy to love. Tommy Rettig did not portray a plastic cute owner like Timmy, (Sorry Timmy fans) but a real 12th year-old fatherless farm boy who filled the gap of his father's absence with the love of his pet. Wonderful series.

The DVD mentioned is a great ""starting taste"" but it does not include the best episodes. Who does one contact to vote or put in a word for the release of SEASON BOX SETS of JEFF'S COLLIE?  I think these episodes are a part of America's Television History and it would be a terrible loss to let them dissapear.",1134259200,35,817,4.613793103448276
1925503,5,B0000DIJNR,"Jeff's Collie is by far the best collection of Lassie TV available on DVD.  I loved this show and used to watch it rerunning on Discovery Kids until some morons decided to take it off the air.  Some of the episodes are a bit long in the tooth, yet they are very, very timely as well.  Lassie is superior in every way to the current Lassie--hard to say how--he just is.  Tommy Rettig and Jan Clayton are excellent as is George Cleveland.  Everyone is long dead now, except Porky.  This is a real treat and delightful viewing--some of today's kids don't like black and white--they are so used to color, but somehow black and white seems to fit here.  Superior.",1127865600,17,658,4.433333333333334
1925504,5,B0000DIJNR,"I am glad to see others here who understand how transcendent this program was. I watched Lassie as a kid during the Timmy era and I liked it but it wasn't my favorite show - more nostalgia than anything else. The Rettig era was before my time. When Animal Planet showed this time period, I took the opportunity to watch it and was totally blown away. I was watching a series right out of the pages of William Saroyan or Lee Harper (To Kill A Mockingbird). The writing, direction, character ensemble, and plots were very, very different from Timmy and Lassie. I could see how the charm and appeal of this series began, and was never acheived again. Subtle elements of progressivism and the human experience, maybe due in part to Sheldon Leonard (who later interjected some of these same elements into the early episodes of The Andy Griffith Show and I Spy) and a female writer, who's name I don't remember, and others who contributed to it, made it stand out like some other shows of the early era of T.V., before the corporate agendists got their mitts on it. I agree with another contributer here; they need to re-release the whole series of the Rettig era show.",1105574400,29,1163,4.569377990430622
1925505,4,B0000DIJNR,"I was born twenty years after the three episodes you'll find on this DVD set.  I grew up with the 'Timmy' episodes of LASSIE on Nickelodeon, but I longed to see the 'Jeff' episodes which I knew about via my parents' recollections of the show.  I was finally able to catch JEFF'S COLLIE on Animal Planet in 1997.  However, that network didn't run (to my knowledge) the pivotal episode, ""The Transition""--included on this 3-episode set--in which the Jeff era gave way to the Timmy era.  Jon Provost and Tommy Rettig together!  I was finally able to see this milestone in the LASSIE TV universe thanks to this release.
If you're into LASSIE, TV or otherwise, and especially the Tommy Rettig ('Jeff') era, this is an excellent set to start with, including the show's premiere episode from 1954, ""The Inheritance.""  Sandwiched in the middle is ""Lassie's Pups,"" famous for Jeff's harrowing nighttime journey to the vet's office, and ""The Transition"" rounds out the set.  The quality of the transfer is as good as anything I've seen, even though the original copies of these shows were not in the best of wear when they were copied.  These early episodes are a bit clunky at times, storywise, yet they're endearing too thanks to strong performances by Jan Clayton, George Cleveland, and especially Tommy Rettig, a truly gifted child actor fifty years ago or today.  If you're going to collect LASSIE's TV adventures, here's where you want to start.",1074988800,51,1441,4.848979591836735
1925506,5,B0000DIJNR,"The early LASSIE episodes were quite different in flavor from the later ones, as Lassie was more of a smart real dog rather than a canine angel in disguise. These are three good episodes, including the series premiere, ""Inheritance,"" in which 9-year-old Jeff Miller is willed Lassie by a deceased neighbor. The nice part is that Lassie doesn't ""take"" to Jeff immediately and that he has to learn to let her love him, rather than trying to make her love him. ""Lassie's Pups"" is the dramatic story of Jeff's odyssey to get help when Lassie seems in danger while having puppies. ""Transition"" is the last episode the Miller family appeared in; an orphan named Timmy :-) that they have been fostering all summer runs away when the Millers have to give up the farm after Gramps' death and he thinks he must go back to his elderly guardians. Introduced are the original actors who played Timmy's parents, Cloris Leachman and Jon Shepodd.",1074643200,57,930,4.746913580246914
8001241,5,B0000DIJNR,Great old original Lassie show. Grew up with Jeff & Lassie; Porky too!!,1520553600,,71,4.538461538461538
8001242,3,B0000DIJNR,When are they going to release this series in it's entirety! I love the show and it seems Lassie is on a few cable stations here and there but they always take it off and replace with another show! My 2 year old son and I were watching it every morning and now it is gone! Please release this series!!!,1516233600,,302,4.05
8001243,1,B0000DIJNR,"Packaging is poor. DVD was already rattling around in the case when it came. The dvd wasn't scratched, but I sadly had to open it to check so it looked used when I gifted it. Very expensive for just a few episodes, too.",1514937600,,219,4.116279069767442
8001244,5,B0000DIJNR,This is NOT about Jon 'boy' Provost ( marshal ? ). These discs feature Tommy Retig the better actor. Jan Clayton was a real sweetheart as his Mom.,1505606400,3,146,4.25
8001245,5,B0000DIJNR,I always give a good review on this series because its the best. Everyone loves Lassie . so keep the episodes coming . Thanks Linda C.,1394409600,,134,4.1923076923076925
8001246,5,B0000DIJNR,"I loved Lassie & Jeff when I was a child and I still do.
Although I have all Lassie DVD's available in the US, I really wish they would finally release all seasons with Jeff and then all seasons with Timmy.
Children still love Lassie today, so why is it taking that long?
There are hundreds of excellent Lassie episodes out there and all we can buy is a handful of episodes of which most are with Timmy, not with Jeff.
I just voted in TVShowsOnDVD for ""Lassie"" and hope that many other Lassie fans will do the same. Maybe the television production company will finally recognize the big buyer potential that a season release of ""Lassie"" would have!",1340496000,7,648,4.453781512605042
8001247,5,B0000DIJNR,"I truly enjoyed the video Jeff's Collie!  It brought back such memories.  the dvd was clear, in good condition and arrived in a most timely manner.  I will most certainly order more of this series.",1314576000,2,197,4.571428571428571
8001248,5,B0000DIJNR,"I love the two boys, Tommy Rettig and John Provost (both passed away) who played in the Lassie TV series. What I would like to see is all the episodes in which Tommy Rettig was in the pilot episode to the very last episode of Lassie. Don't just give me a taste of this TV series with some appetizers. I want the whole enchilada. Sell me the complete set. Lassie was a good TV series when I was just a little boy and it can be a great series for future generations of kids.",1305936000,8,472,4.031914893617022
8001249,4,B0000DIJNR,"It's nice to get these DVDs so many years after first seeing the show, and have all one's happy memories confirmed.

Jan Clayton was THE mum to have in childhood's roleplay, Gramps was a model to follow and Tommy Rettig was a marvellous child/teen actor.

The third episode here is where Gramps has died, Mum and Jeff are to move away, and the new couple are introduced. Lassie, of course, elects to stay with Timmy (Jon Provost). I do not believe that I have seen that episode since the late '50s, but it all came back and was as emotional now as 50 years ago.

I only wish I could have shown these to my children (now too old) but here's hoping for any grandchildren that may come along!",1269216000,7,689,4.325581395348837
