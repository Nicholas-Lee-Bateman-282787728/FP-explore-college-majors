Before one even watches this movie, a close reading of the synopsis on the back cover, reveals everything anyone would want to know about the movie, maybe too much. There are many serious, dramatic scenes in this movie, which bring the audience to laughter:
The infamous 19-shot revolver, the innocent homeless man getting kicked over early in the movie, the mysterious man with a cord coming out of his back, the motorcycle rider that briefly forgets Roland's location after giving him the fiercest expression one could ever imagine, the magical moving mirror hanging on the wall in the highly emotional ""beautiful back"" scene, the highly skilled two-story-jumping ninjas, the painting-like acting of Gary Daniels, and the non-stop back-flipping action fed to us by the stunt men.
This movie is entertaining and is a source for many inside jokes between the viewers. This movie gets three stars for being a comedy and one for an action movie.",1088208000,5,1093,5.010989010989011
1078154,5,6305701121,"Confession: I bought this movie for one reason -- Gary Daniels, one of the prettiest and most appealing men ever filmed.
I'm not a martial arts fan per se, so it didn't bother me that this movie doesn't have quite as many, nor as flashy, fight scenes as Gary's ""Bloodmoon"" did. I imagine that martial arts fans will nonetheless appreciate what is in this movie. There isn't exactly a shortage of knockdown martial arts fighting here.
What this movie did have, moreso than some of Gary's other films, is an opportunity for Gary to act. He briefly plays two characters, and here one can see that he really can portray a character that is quite unlike the staid, somber hero part that the dialogue/script usually confines him to. It is almost disconcerting to see him playing such an uncharacteristic personality (as the married brother) -- very unlike his performance in any other movie (except perhaps ""Spoiler"" which also is an odd performance).
Gary looks stunning in this movie. He sports a bit of a scruffy, unshaven look here, but it works very well on him. When the camera lingers on Gary's face, as happens in several scenes where he gets to show some emotion, one can see that this face is a work of sheer art -- the pinnacle of male beauty. And Gary's physique is equally as impressive, which he shows off a little in some scenes -- perfectly sculpted, proportionate, and defined.
I would have liked to have seen more of a love interest explored. (Unfortunately, very, very few Gary Daniels movies do have a satisfactory plot development in this regard. It's inexplicable that here is one of the prettiest men on film, and yet he never gets a notable love story. Go figure).
It also has a sensible (albeit perhaps not exhilarating) plot that could be understood and followed. It isn't just a series of fight scenes cut together.
I think that this is one of Gary's best. It has a little bit of everything that you'd find in a Gary Daniels movie, showcased in a favorable way. You may find a better fight scene in Bloodmoon, or even more acting from Gary in Spoiler, or maybe even a more interesting plot in Delta Force or Hawk's Vengeance. But overall, Cold Harvest is a solid movie from him in all regards.",1052611200,3,2214,4.621827411167513
1078155,2,6305701121,"Well I've never seen the lead actor before and I will probably
pass on any future movies of his. He is nice to look at even the bad guy was easy on the eyes. But I would rate this movie a C- (or 2 stars) it is a low budget and came across as such.",1051574400,2,247,3.5090909090909093
1078156,2,6305701121,"Whenever I think of this movie, my mind springs back to the day when I first spotted it in my local video store in the BAD ACTION section. My friend picked it up, and exclaimed: ""What does Daniels think he's playing at?"" As he showed me the absurd cover with Gary Daniels doing his ""Clint Eastwood"" bit. The stupid cover aside, this movie zips along at a fair pace with some pretty impressive direction by Isaac Florentine (I am surprised by now that the Hollywood A list hasn't given this guy a bigger gig, what with his strong visual style and action sensibilities - he seems ideal to put the Van Dammes and Seagals' through their paces in a big budget action flick!). Daniels too jumps and kicks his way through some excellent action sequences and its always good to RE-ANIMATOR heroine Barabara Crampton in a movie now and again. Villain Bryan Genesse sleepwalks his way through the movie, in what can be described as CYBORG meets A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.
Hmmm, can I recommend it? Well, if you like low-budget action movies, it's certainly not the worst around. The 2 stars are for the non-stop direction by Florentine and maybe half a star for Gary Daniels and his cigar-chomping stance on the video cover. If you're drawn to this movie for Daniels, check out HAWKS VENGEANCE (a better Gary Daniels movie, that is nearing somewhere in the vicinity of entertainment and RAGE, another entertaining but dumb actioner). They're all stupid, but strangely agreeable.",1004313600,,1463,4.7637795275590555
1078157,1,6305701121,"I was very much disappointed with this movie. The plot of the movie at the beginning seems to be interesting. But that doesn't last long. Everything starts to fall down after the widow and her brother-in-law gets acquainted with each other. The ending is another absurdity that needs to be highlighted but due to the review policy restrictions, I'm holding that one out.
The fighting scenes are o.k.  One note on the fighting scenes though: the director of this movie should have paid more attention to the details as the ropes hanging behind the stuntmen can be clearly seen.
Even if you have 10 dollars to spare, don't waste it on this movie.",992044800,,644,4.699115044247788
1078158,5,6305701121,"I hope that this is not the last movie that pairs Isaac Florentine with Gary Daniels.  Florentine's direction was able to allow Gary Daniels to turn in his best overall performance for several reasons.  Florentine, first and foremost,allows Daniels to act.  While a lot of people would be content just to allow Gary Daniels to use his amazing combat skills without plot or character development, Florentine encourages Daniels to become a true leading man.  Daniels responds by giving two solid acting performances as identical twin brothers.  He does a great job of establishing his characters' dignity and emnotions without compromising his credibility as a fighter.  Florentine also directs the fight sequences with attention to minute details such as sounds and quick zooms, making them surreally ultra-violent, like something out of Sam Rami's Evil Dead book.  Daniels also shows why he is one of the best action heros around by turning in the best, and most intricate fight sequences of his career.  The interspersal of hand to hand combat with old-west gunslinging really makes this film moves. The fight scenes also make great use of available props, like Jackie chan's Rumble in the Bronx fights. Also of note are really solid and appropriately humourous supporting performances by Little Ray and his gang of thugs.  All in all this is a superb action package that will leave anyone even casually into action films satisfied with their purchase.",980294400,2,1453,5.148936170212766
1078159,5,6305701121,"This movie is a futuristic action with some martial arts thrown in. I could never choose a better martial artist than Gary Daniels who plays the parts of a wimpy sensitive husband and twin brother to the main character a cold bounty hunter who seems impervious to danger.
Aside from the awesome action and heart pounding action scenes this move had lots of subtle comedy. People who were kicked flew around a bit more than they should have. The swoosh sound of moving body parts was extended to include the turning of a head or the subtle movements of hands. Also the bad guy (little Ray) had perfect timing when executing his one-liners.
Another reason I like this movie is because they let the performers perform. The director respects the mannerisms of the professionals and gives them the time to really bring their characters out.
I wish there could have been more fighting in the movie but it was not made as a martial arts flick, merely an action with some strong martial flavor. Highly recommended",977529600,2,1005,4.715909090909091
1078160,4,6305701121,"This has got to be one of Gary Daniels best movies.  The story was okay, the acting average, but the action and martial arts was way above average!  The only bad thing in this movie was Daniels western theme song which was  so annoying.  However the shootouts where great especially when Gary  Daniels flipped off a wall shooting a guy behind him during the flip!  So  far I have never seen something like that even in Hong kong movies! So buy  this movie for its great sound and great action. P.S. The end fight between  Daniels and the villian is top notch!",955756800,6,559,4.401960784313726

7895332,3,6305701121,"During the 1990s, director Isaac Florentine was on a quest to make movies with all the B-movie action heroes he could get his hands on. In 1999 - between working with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dolph-Lundgren/dp/B00003ETM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dolph Lundgren</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Worth/dp/B00005RDRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Worth</a>&nbsp;- he collaborated with Gary Daniels and Bryan Genesse on a sci-fi pseudo-western. Like most of his work from this period, the results were mixed: while the martial artistry is just about all you could hope for, the technical aspects of the movie are lacking. ""Cold Harvest"" feels like the only film Florentine undertook that was simply too big for him, and it's clear why: you can't make&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firefly/dp/B0000AQS0F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firefly</a>&nbsp;on a $3.6 million budget.

The story: in a dystopian future where a plague has dwindled mankind's numbers, a woman who holds the potential cure to the sickness (Barbara Crampton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Re-Animator/dp/B000MKXEME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Re-Animator</a>) is protected en-route to safety by a bounty hunter (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-the-North-Star/dp/B0001US7MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of the North Star</a>) while being pursued by a dangerous outlaw gang leader wanting the antidote for himself (Genesse,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Street-Justice/dp/B000JCE3N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Street Justice</a>).

The movie takes place entirely at night (technically, people can't tell whether it's day or night anymore) in the streets and locales of a demolished urban center. Plainly, everything looks like it's a movie set. You hardly ever see the sky, with the camera always either standing at level or looking downwards against a backdrop of greyish-brown buildings. It's not necessarily boring to look at, you just never buy that they're actually in a city. In general, this whole world seems a bit inharmonious: the aforementioned pseudo-western vibe feels contrived and certain aspects of the (surprisingly chaste) relationship between Gary's and Barbara Crampton's characters probably sounded good in the script but don't really fit the context of the picture onscreen. Acting-wise, the story is weak: while Bryan Genesse's portrayal of the sleazy outlaw would later be plagiarized by Matt Schulze in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>, B-movie princess Barbara gives a throwaway performance and Gary just doesn't do well, even by his own standards. It's all very, very corny.

However, if you're like me, you'll be able to set that aside to enjoy the fight scenes. They're not the best you'll find in a Florentine film but still stand near the top of direct-to-video offerings, thanks to Gary's consistent physical abilities and the creative efforts of ever-underappreciated fight choreographer Akihiro Noguchi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja/dp/B002XTBE5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja</a>). There are a few good stunts that have become the trademark of Noguchi's Alpha Stunts team, but the karate encounters is where the meat of the action's at. For those of you who don't know him, Gary's not among the tricksters you find a lot in modern fare but his ability to deliver flying spin kicks is definitely Hong Kong-esque and sets his work apart from the basic stuff delivered by someone like Van Damme. The four fistfights (mainly one-against-many setups) are appealingly fast-paced, feature admirable camerawork, and even incorporate a bit of Jackie Chan-style utilization of the environment (tripping attackers with tables, etc.). Bryan Genesse only has one fight - the showdown with Gary - and while he's not as flawlessly smooth in his physical delivery as Daniels, you can tell he's making the most of his abilities. There's a section of the fight wherein Bryan and Gary duel for a metal pipe, continually finding ways to steal it from eachother, that's particularly impressive for the amount of intricate exchanges going on. Plainly, you won't be disappointed by the brawls.

There's a good deal of Florentine's overdramatization to be seen here in the way he sets up shots and his whooshing sound effects, but this shouldn't kill the film for you, if you know you're about to watch a B-movie. In the end, it's up to the individual viewer to decide if good fight scenes are worth a purchase, but fans of Florentine should definitely make the buy - just be sure to pick up his really good stuff first, lest you be potentially disappointed by this one and cease building your collection.",1331769600,,5063,6.496296296296296

7895336,2,6305701121,"Gee... where do I begin? I suppose I can sum Cold Harvest in one word: Craptacular. It's a low budget movie, but that's not why it is bad. It's a clichd action flick, but surprisingly enough that's not why Cold Harvest is bad either. It's bad because it performs so low on categorically every aspect of film making whatever decent stuff there is (and there are only a few) doesn't stand much of a chance to get around the lame script production values.

Isaac Florentine is known for using B-movie production values and over the top martial arts. This has brought him success with his work on the Power Rangers. This time it doesn't work. For one the script is awful. It's hardly more than just a series of action scenes hardly tied together with some sort of cookie cutter plot that seems to show up in lots of post apocalyptic movies. As a matter of fact this movie hardly qualifies as a science fiction aside from an intro talking about a comet and a plague. Half the scenes could be completely thrown away and you wouldn't miss it in the continuity. While it's a little interesting seeing an old west style angle in the plot it doesn't go anywhere aside from the props and spaghetti western stare down contests. The characters are one-dimensional and play out their roles with as much depth as wax paper. I am not talking about the acting, which is mostly canned but does have some pretty decent moments. I am talking about the script. Cold Harvest is written badly. It's a sad day when the only character development you see is from a side character talking about noses.

The sets are laughably cheap. You can see the bricks are painted on plaster walls. The sound effects are so bad they are laughable, especially the blatant abuse of using the 'whoosh' sound every time someone moves. Continuity? Don't look here for it. The old west guns they like so much in this movie seem to be able to load themselves magically. I counted at least 10 bullets coming out of a six round revolver more than once in this movie. And when they are actually fighting our hero, Roland (Gary Daniels), they forget to bring the guns and just go martial arts on each other. Real smart boys. The action is admittedly pretty cool even if it gets way over the top at times. The fighting parts look cool but the stunts coming from it like the flips and spins from getting hit can get pretty cheesy. Also there are scenes where stunts are done that really don't fit. I found myself scratching my head wondering what just happened. This movie seems more like a showcase for stunt men than anything else.

This movie pretty much sucks aside from the martial arts. If you are really into martial arts and can ignore EVERYTHING else then you just might like Cold Harvest. If you have any need for a decent script or production values you can forget it. Of course this movie would be great fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000 so those of you who like making fun of cheesy movies can have something new on your list with this one.",1158278400,4,3007,4.503663003663004
7895337,4,6305701121,"Due to the nature of low budget films, some film directors do not get the opportunity to bring more to the screen and show the true potential of a film project;...Such is the case of ""Cold Harvest"", a low budget martial arts action thriller which attempts to combine the post-apocalyptic feel of ""The Road Warrior"" with elements of the old-western frontier and stylized martal arts action.

Because of under-average production quality, an underdeveloped storyline and script, under-average music, and poor acting from the extras and a few of the lead actors, ""Cold Harvest"" ultimately suffers from a lot of mediocrity, which leaves much of the film's true potential to be desired. Fortunately however, what saves the film from being almost unenjoyable is the much improved fight choreography and stuntwork that is desperately needed for western action cinema, combined with the efforts of stuntman and co-founder of the extreme martial arts stunt team ""Alpha Stunts"" Akihiro ""Yuji"" Noguchi, along with slick editing and great foley mixing, and the athletic talents of Gary Daniels and Bryan Genese.

If you don't mind watching a film with great action sequences despite the flaws that result from a low budget, then Cold Harvest will make a great addition to add to your collection.

Daniels plays a bounty hunter in a world drastically changed after a comet collides!!!  Bryan Genessee is the villain, who also happens to be an old childhood buddy, but of course he has gone the wrong way and his vile gang wants to control the gasoline in this apocalyptic society.  Daniels gets to play two roles:  the aforementioned bounty hunter and his twin brother, who just happens to have the gene that can come up with an antidote for some vile plague that has surfaced.  When he is mercilessly slaughtered by Gennessee, lovely wife Barbara Crampton (Reanimator) is on the run and soon joins her brother-in-law.

Nothing new or unpredictable here, but Crampton is always fun to watch and Daniels is a good martial arts hero.  I had fun with it!",1096588800,,919,4.635802469135802
