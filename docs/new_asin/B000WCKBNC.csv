8222632,4,B000WCKBNC,"I bought this video on Amazon a couple years ago precisely because it is advertised as having Russian as well as English audio. On the copy I have, there is no English audio track... only Russian. Now this is still fine for me, as I like the rich sound of the Russian language, and the English (which you can see on youtube) makes it sound a little sillier to me. Some stuff may be ""lost in translation"", shall we say. On the outside jacket, it says ""Watch Cheburashka in  English or Russian."" I've played it in different DVD players, including my computer, and none of them could find an English audio track. The DVD itself (at least my copy - and maybe it is JUST a COPY)says ""Russian with English subtitles"". And the outside of the case says ""Russian and English Language Menus"" but that's just referring to the on screen menu.

There were English subtitles. On one player I tried, they were out of sync on the last video. But on my computer, it played fine in sync. No idea why.

The promised extra feature (Mittens?)is nowhere to be found on this DVD either. I can't find or access it. It might be worth the current 31 bucks asking price IF it had what it advertized, but beware of that because my copy did not. The absence of all this was okay by me, except that I bought this for my five year old nieces and for that reason, it would have been nice to have this in English language, not just English subtitles. For these reasons, the advertising gets 3 stars.

The story itself gets 5 stars because these blow Western cartoons/animations away, in my estimation, just because of the violence factor in Western films, which is refreshingly lacking in this story. Cheburashka is a furry little innocent creature that goes around trying to help others. He's such a good example for children. In an interview asking children why they loved him, even the youngest said something to the effect: ""He's like my little brother... he looks so innocent, you just want to protect him"" endearing much more than violent tendencies in children. This is what I'd rather my kids see than violent western cartoons. They even tackled environmental issues (factory dumping of waste and recycling)long before I heard about these issues over here (1971 vs 1988, when I ran into recycling at College). So get this for your kids. Lacks the glitz of Hollywood productions (backgrounds kind of sparse) but makes up for it in storyline, moral characters, and original catchy traditional Russian music. :)

If I bought another one, I'd ask Amazon to verify the veracity of what was being advertized, because it is fraudulent, in my opinion, to sell something based on clever or false advertizing (especially if charging a premium for it). And the ""copy"" I got was certainly based on that. So beware of what you buy. Ironic that it is pretty much against the nature of the film to lie about it. So 4 stars overall. :)",1349740800,,2894,4.611650485436893
8222633,5,B000WCKBNC,"This is one of the best Russian animated film series ever made! Children of all ages all over Russia adore them! Once the films were introduced in Japan, kids all over Japan fell in love with them, too. Especially with the cute main character called Cheburashka, a sweet creature with floppy ears and a big, big heart.
This DVD release contains all four series, now restored and dubbed into English (a plus for those who are not fluent in Russian). You still can watch them in Russian, if you would like. Just choose the Russian audio track when you access the DVD menu. There are also English subtitles available. Or, go for English language audio track. It's done pretty well. Even songs, for which this film is known as well, were translated!

If you are not familiar with the story of Cheburashka, he was that strange animal found in the crate of oranges and later turned away from the Moscow Zoo. Cheburashka would have ended up being homeless had he not been befriended by a lonely crocodile Gena. Both Gena and Cheburashka, as you soon may find out, are innocent, child-like characters, who make the film a humorous, good-natured adventure.

In addition to the Cheburashka stories, this DVD has one more short animated film made in Russia - it's named ""The Mitten"". The film is about a little girl who always wanted to have a puppy and finally got one! This DVD is recommended for toddlers, and not only for them!",1206403200,5,1420,4.653386454183267
