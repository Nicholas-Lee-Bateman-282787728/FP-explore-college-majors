You can readily see that the movie was transferred from a VHS tape, and a bad one at that, to DVD. The movie flutters, specks and lines all over the film; and you can ever see a VHS tape ""glitch"" near the end of the movie. That's probably why about 7 minutes of the movie was cut, in the beginning, which eliminated the opening credits. To put a movie on DVD, in this condition, is an insult and a wasted of time.",1461283200,,549,4.188679245283019

8045392,2,B00077BOP6,"This was like watching a movie that had been taped on an old VCR recording from a TV and then transferred to a DVD.  The audio was very poor and the video was not much better.  Will never buy from ""fatcat"" again.",1378684800,,212,4.023809523809524

8045394,1,B00077BOP6,"This is the same movie as ""ski lift to death"" - which i discovered while searching for it.  It's still the great 70's -type drama, but in this edition, the quality of the film is horrific - truly blinding!  Nearly unbearable to watch.  Also, during a dance contest sequence, someone tried to insert newer, hipper music into the film, which made for people not dancing to the music, and any dialog during the segment overlaid with two different tracks of music.  What a nightmare!!  If i  could ever find a good copy, that hadn't been altered, i'd love to enjoy it again!  Was this a pirated copy off someones old VCR then sound edited and dubbed onto DVD? Probably!!!",1298937600,4,667,4.554621848739496
8045395,1,B00077BOP6,"I saw this when it debuted on TV in the late 70s, so for $5 I bought it to see if it was as I remembered.  The storyline is really basic, but it might be worthwhile if you are a fan of any of the actors and want to see their earlier/more obscure work.  Don Johnson in particular was quite adorable in those days, and does a not half bad job.  Lisa Reeves seems to have disappeared, too bad.  Also Howard Duff, Veronica Hamel, Deborah Raffin (she's actually the star of the movie).  Two stars for nostalgia, but ...

Warning: the quality of this DVD is horrendous.  Really bad sound, lots of tape jump and scratches, and the colour correction changes abruptly part way through the movie.  No stars if I could!

Also, if you are a ski fan, I'll save you the trouble - there is one extended freestyle scene, although some crafty editing has several shots repeated, all to the soundtrack from the Young & the Restless, super cheese!  There are also a bunch of ski jumps shown as part of a competition, but they likely don't compare to the sport today.",1209945600,11,1047,4.350515463917525
