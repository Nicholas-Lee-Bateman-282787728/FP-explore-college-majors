8501145,3,B006MW37IW,My 3 yr old was having problems enunciating words so I figured I give this a try. I'd like to think it worked a little. It's very short and pretty boring for a toddler.,1492300800,,168,3.9705882352941178
8501146,5,B006MW37IW,It's amazing how the kid picks up habits from the DVD. His vocab has grown; I would recommend the flash cards as well for not just TV learning.,1440028800,,143,4.142857142857143
8501147,5,B006MW37IW,"I first bought 'Our Day', Sookie and Finn's first dvd for our daughter, it soon proved to be popular and helped to get words out of her.  I bought this DVD and 'Going To School'.  At the moment this is her new favourite.  This DVD works just as well as 'Our Day', she likes to try and repeat the words, she likes the songs. I work with her to try to encourage words and sounds, we did speech therapy but that had limited success, she recently started school and that is also helping. We have tried several different DVDs.  She soon grew tired of the other DVDs but Sookie and Finn has been popular for much longer than other DVDs, perhaps because it's the only one that has a story line or because she feels that she can relate easily to the words

We've still got a long way to go, it's just going to take time, patience and perseverance.  We keep an open mind and are happy to try anything that might help.",1425513600,2,908,4.189655172413793
8501148,5,B006MW37IW,"These two are great.  We love watching their videos with the cool british accents!  They are just too funny.  These are good, we love all the songs and nursery rhymes in the videos.  My kids love Sookie and Finn.  My daughter uses a british accent now!!!  Isnt that too funny, she's 6 and talks like Sookie and tells me her brother is Finn.",1397088000,,340,4.317460317460317
8501149,5,B006MW37IW,"My children love the whole series.  I initially got it for my 3 year old boy that has a speech delay, but my 1 year old also enjoys it.  It teaches a lot of words in a fun yet structural setting.  The accent does not bother us.  We actually enjoy it!",1390348800,,250,3.843137254901961
