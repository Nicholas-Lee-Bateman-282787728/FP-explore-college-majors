3960141,5,B002NTDXS2,"I love Monk! He's very entertaining. PLUS my kids can watch him, it's a great family show. I'm really going to miss it!",1268956800,,119,4.217391304347826
3960142,5,B002NTDXS2,"This is a great DVD. We watch it during Lunch at work.
I highly recomend ths DVD",1265414400,2,80,3.764705882352941
3960143,3,B002NTDXS2,"The concept of having the ""best"" episodes on one DVD is a good idea, but I think that such a recap of this great series should have been delayed just long enough to include the two-part finale of Season 8 (not unlike the wrap up of ""The Fugitive"" from the '60s, which brings to a conclusion the protagonist's long and difficult search for the guilty one-armed murderer).  So... how about an updated version of the ""Best of Monk"" which includes this dramatic and heartrending two-part climax?",1260662400,16,491,4.709302325581396
3960144,3,B002NTDXS2,"I recommend this DVD as it would have been impossible for the producers of ""The Best of Monk"" to satisfy everyone with their choices.  However, even though there are some good episodes on this DVD I'm still surprised by the ones that were excluded.  Some of the Monk episodes that should have been included by season order are:

""Mr. Monk Meets Dale the Whale"" (Season 1, Ep. 4)
""Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic"" (Season 3, Ep. 13)
""Mr. Monk Goes Home Again"" (Season 4, Ep. 2)
""Mr. Monk and the Astronaut"" (Season 4, Ep. 14)
""Mr. Monk Is on the Air"" (Season 5. Ep. 13
""Mr. Monk and the Rapper"" (Season 6, Ep. 2) or ""Mr. Monk and the Bad  Girlfriend"" (Season 6, Ep. 4) and
""Mr. Monk and the Magician"" (Season 7, Ep. 15).

I'm okay with the fact that they included ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate (Season 1, Ep. 1) and ""Mr. Monk and the Leper"" (Season 5, Ep. 10).  Those episodes were pretty epic and they shouldn't be missed.  However, I do think the producers excluded some pretty good episodes, the majority of which were originally aired during the fourth and sixth seasons including: ""Mr. Monk and His Biggest Fan"" and ""Mr. Monk and the Daredevil"" but you can't have it all so they did an alright job.  I also think that they should have included ""Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra"" so maybe they should have selected the 15 best episodes or 20 best episodes instead of limiting it to only 8.  That's not enough for them to accurately selected the best fan favorite Monk episodes but still this DVD is enjoyable, so I recommend it regardless.",1259452800,23,1529,4.412811387900356
3960145,4,B002NTDXS2,"This little two disc set is fun for the casual Monk fan.  Of course, can there really be such a thing when you are talking about the obsessive compulsive detective?

The two disc contain one episode a season from the hit show.  That's right, they've include one from the about the conclude eighth season.  These aren't necessarily the most important, but they are the ones that were chosen as the best.

The episodes include ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate,"" ""Mr. Monk and the Three Pies,"" ""Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine,"" ""Mr. Monk Bumps His Head,"" ""Mr. Monk and the Leper,"" ""Mr. Monk is Up all Night,"" ""Mr. Monk and the Miracle,"" and ""Mr. Monk and the UFO.""

Frankly, I can see how this would be an almost impossible choice.  I'm sure everyone has their favorites.  It does make sense to start off with the two part pilot, which sets things up.  And ""Three Pies"" is one of my favorites.  On the other hand, ""Up all Night"" is one of my least favorites.  Why was it included here?

Still, if you want a taste of this quirky mystery comedy in your collection, you will be satisfied.  Some of these cases are downright confusing, which is saying something for a show known for light mysteries.  ""UFO"" in particular had me confused the entire way through.  There are some great laughs here as Monk has to deal with the outside world.  And the acting and character interactions are always top notch.

I doubt you could please all the fans of this show with only eight episodes.  Still, I would choose something different if it were up to me.  Guess that makes it a good thing I can obsessively watch my complete season sets.",1258416000,50,1614,4.503448275862069

3960185,5,B002NTDXS2,"One of the best shows ever to grace television! Tony Shaloub is perfect as Adrian Monk! Granted, this is a studio selected best of, so of course it won't have every bodies favorite episodes, but still, there is not a bad episode in all of the 8 seasons! It does have the two part pilot, but would have been great if it also had the first episode that Natalie came in on and the final episode, other wise I would say it's a perfect best of set!",1405641600,2,443,4.103448275862069
3960186,5,B002NTDXS2,Monk was an iconic show. The Best of Monk has some of the greatest of Tony Shalhoub. His acting and his character cannot be compared to anyone. This was a totally unique idea. Love this DVD!!,1401840000,,191,4.333333333333333

3960189,5,B002NTDXS2,No one like Monk and his weird set of hangups.  Though Holmes on the TV series today is a close second.  Monk and his hangups fit right into the investigations.  I stayed with this series though all the seasons.,1389052800,,211,4.358974358974359

3960193,5,B002NTDXS2,"I didn't see every single Monk episode, but these
are billed as the best one from each season.  I wasn't
disappointed. The famous medication-taking episode is
included where he completely changes personality with
no more crime solving ability. I would recommend this
DVD to Monk followers who want a taste of the best without
spending too much money.",1355788800,2,350,5.0344827586206895

3960196,5,B002NTDXS2,"This show is great.  If you give it a chance you will love it.  This set contains some of the best eppisodes.
However if you are a first timer to the Monk series I would suggest watching sonme of the earlier seasons episodes to get a feel for the show.  Either way these are quality episodes on quality discs.",1331856000,,309,4.203389830508475
3960197,5,B002NTDXS2,"Best of monk is a a must have if you like Monk. Tony shalhoub is an amazing actor and producer. This DVD contains 8 episodes, one from each serie. If you like monk and cant afford to buy all the collection, you should buy this one.",1324080000,4,231,4.043478260869565
3960198,4,B002NTDXS2,"I'm not really the biggest ""Monk"" fan. So, other people may give better reviews. If you are a real ""Monk"" fan, you probably will want every season anyway.

However, if you are a 'kind of' or 'so so' ""Monk"" fan, this DVD really gives you a lot of 'Monk Power' for your dollar.

It begins with the Pilot ""Mr. Monk and the Candidate"" which allows you to meet everyone, and is kind of a 2 for 1, since it is the length of 2 episdoes.

""Mr. Monk and the 3 Pies"" is a great episdoe that makes you wonder 'what on earth is going on?' for just the right amount of time. (Nice conclusion with a bang too.)

""Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine"" is a nice episdoe where we realize if Monk were normal, he wouldn't be so effective or nice.

""Mr. Monk Bumps His Head"" is a nice episdoe where he forgets who he is, and a woman finds him SO attractive.

""Mr. Monk Is Up All Night"" is yet another interesting episdoe with an unusually creepy feel.

Without going through every episdoe, I'll just say, all in all, it's a really great dvd for the 'so so' ""Monk"" fan. This dvd will really give you a lot of value for your money.",1307491200,14,1102,4.121495327102804

3960200,5,B002NTDXS2,"A must-have for all Monk fans. Has one episode from each season. It's a good way to get a Monk-fix, now that it's off the air.",1296259200,,126,3.8846153846153846

8375423,5,B002NTDXS2,"It's time someone wrote a review of the ""Little Monk"" portion of this DVD set.  Why?  For every-obsessive fan out there, the ""complete series box sets"" (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monk-The-Complete-Series/dp/B01IP2X73G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monk: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;) contains every episode - except the ""Little Monk"" ones!  Ten webisodes were created (see wikipedia for details), but they were never available on DVD - until now!  They're all here!  The manufacturer combined the 10 webisodes into ""Chapters"" and made one nice long video (over 30+ minutes) of all the Little Monk stories.  As a bonus, they added a behind the scenes/interviews extra (another 8+ minutes).  Bottom line: to Monkishly make sure you own the FULL series and not just 99 out of 100 (unthinkable!), purchase this.  Be as big of a fan as Marci and I! ;)",1506470400,,897,5.793893129770993
