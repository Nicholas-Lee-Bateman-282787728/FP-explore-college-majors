3961136,1,B002OEBRJ8,"The drugs of Hollywood!  No talent, nothing creative, same old music,.  The ""B"" movies of the 1950's were 100% better than this piece of trash.  To bad Hollywood wasn't located in New Orleans.",1125360000,,192,4.757575757575758
3961137,2,B002OEBRJ8,"The good news: this movie features some of the best sets I've ever seen in a movie.  The set design, the props, the colors---everything that is visual about this movie is top-notch.  This is the definition of eye-candy, right here.  Beautiful.  Brilliant images fill the screen from start to finish.  And since not many movies are set underwater or within caves, many of the sets look exotic and otherworldly, which is all the more reason the visuals are so appealing.

The bad news: everything else.

""The Cave"" is a subpar action-horror with a bunch of slimy, fanged monsters stalking and/or eating a group of young, attractive explorers.  It features pretty much all of the cliches you'd expect from an action-horror and doesn't really try to break the mold.  This wouldn't be a problem, necessarily, if the script and acting and direction were at least done well.  Unfortunately, they aren't.

There are only two good actors in the whole movie: Cole Hauser and Daniel Dae Kim.  The latter is on screen for about ten minutes, total, and for six of those minutes he just runs around screaming.  Not a great opportunity to show off talent.  Hauser does a decent job, but the character he has to play is ludicrous and his lines are laughable, so you don't really notice his performance half the time.

Everybody else is forgettable.  The female lead, in particular, is bland.

The screenplay is aggravating.  We are told, in the beginning of the movie, that these characters are professionals and scientists, but they speak like losers.  For example, when they first go into The Cave, Blonde Girl screams, ""Totally awesome!""  While this is certainly the sentiment that comes to mind when seeing the set, you might think that a scientist would be able to say something a bit more intelligent.  Unfortunately, the dialogue stays around that same level of sophistication throughout.

Needless to say, the characters are all flat and uninteresting.  But you probably guessed that already.

But even with a bad script, bad acting, and a cliched plot, this movie could still have mustered at least a three star rating if it wasn't for the gaping plot holes and inconsistencies.  Dr. Old Guy and Dr. Hot Chick examine two slides of cells collected within The Cave and discover a parasite within them.  Then they find one of the monsters' claws and cut it open.  Within three seconds, they are able to conclude that the claw is infected with the parasite, too.  Huh?  They don't need a microscope or anything?  Okay, whatever....

Dr. Hot Chick explains that they are dealing with a species that evolved in total isolation.  Uh, okay, don't know how she surmised all of that from exactly ten seconds of observing a claw, but then why would the monster be a parasite?  Isn't it a little bit contradictory for a parasite to live in an environment where there isn't much life to leech off of?

And if the animals are predators, then why are they also parasites?  Shouldn't they just be eating the humans instead of infecting them and transforming them?  Do the monsters act like vampires and get to choose who transforms and who just turns into food?  And if they don't, then how have the monsters lived for so long in The Cave?  After a bazillion years in isolation, shouldn't everything be infected, and consequently they would've died from starvation?  Or are they cannibals?  And if they are cannibals, then why are they hunting the humans, specifically?

The monsters just plain don't make any sense.  Sure, this isn't one of those newfangled ""thinking"" movies, but you would think that a couple of simple things could be sorted out before the filmmakers set out to film this crap.

It all leads up to an ending which is among the lamest and least explicable endings I've ever seen.  I won't ruin it, but let me just say this: I thought the movie already couldn't get any more incomprehensible, and then I saw the ending.  Now my brain hurts.",1125187200,113,3936,4.774480712166172

3961139,2,B002OEBRJ8,"I really wanted to like this movie.  It looked spectacular from a visual standpoint, and the premise sounded promising.  And since I've seen my fair share of documentaries on underwater cave explorations, I was especially intrigued to see how the filmmakers would go about constructing the film as realistically as possible.

Unfortunately, it's just not that good, justifiably confirming the inkling that swept down on me after taking in the first 15 minutes of the film.

I can appreciate how hard it must have been to make this movie.  Just looking at it, the production values are stunning.  I sat through most of the movie thinking, ""There's no way they reconstructed this many life-like caves on a soundstage.  Some of these set pieces have GOT to be the real thing.""  And the same goes for all the scenes in which the divers are swimming underwater with all their gear; it looks absolutely gorgeous with all the rich blues and greens, most of it brought to life with just the right amount of lighting.  The cinematography is to die for in this movie.  Those men and women who worked behind the scenes to give us all the excellent visuals are to be given a hearty congratulations and more than just one pat on the back.  Movie-making has never looked so gorgeous.

And I can appreciate the effort the actors put forth into making this film.  I can only imagine the training they went through to prepare for such a grueling experience and the long hours they had to put in.  There's a LOT of climbing, swimming, falling down, and just general rough-and-tumble stunts going on here.  Physically, it had to be taxing, and to try and bring a bunch of words on paper to life during all that is understandably hard.

So I can appreciate all that went into the movie to bring it to the big screen.  Unfortunately, the story just isn't that good.  And the scares don't resonate with the audience because we don't know enough about those being snuffed out to care.  So the old guy gets killed by the creature.  Okay . . . who was he again, and what was his story?  Constructing a bunch of one-note characters simply for the sake of killing them off does nothing for audiences who expect and deserve more.  And was anyone even remotely frightened of the creature?  I spent too much time trying to figure out the heck was going on with Shaky! Camera during those scenes as the creature was feasting on one cardboard character after another.  There's a difference between holding an audience in suspense by only revealing snippets of your antagonist (something done to perfection in ""Signs"") and pulling out the old ""I'll just spaz out with the camera so people can't figure out what it looks like!"" routine.  And while we're at it, overdoing the sound a creature makes when it's nearby is annoying.  When used sparingly, otherworldly guttural sounds can truly be foreboding and even frightening.  ""Signs"" ran well with this concept, and ""The Grudge"" hit one out of the park.

In the end, I give this film two stars.  One star for the absolutely outstanding effort the filmmakers spent on making the film look as visually stunning as it does.  Not a single scene is wasted from a production values standpoint.  And I give the second star to the actors who, even though they made a movie that will quickly be forgotten by most of the viewing audience, worked their tails off by doing the best they could with the material they were given.

Oh, what could have been.",1125187200,7,3458,4.6551155115511555
3961140,2,B002OEBRJ8,"I should have followed the critics' recommendations and avoided this movie.  The premise of this film was an interesting one - the exploration of an ancient, vast underground cave system that may contain ""demon-like"" creatures - but the movie made from it is ultra-lame.  There's way too much thrashing around in the water without very much actually happening.  Just one example of my many frustrations with this flick is how there were a lot of underwater scenes of people swimming around (shot from below), but we rarely see anything coming up from down in the depths to grab somebody.  Most of the action scenes are just a blur -- it's really just about impossible to understand what's going on from moment to moment in the action scenes.  In one scene, the main character, Jack, gets bitten by something (apparently one of the alien creatures) - a large tear on the back of his shoulder - but we never see him getting chomped at the time it happens.  We only see the wound when he rejoins his companions.  The actual moment of the attack is just a bunch of blurry thrashing in the water.  This kind of lazy film-making may have been caused by a lack of creativity, or budget limitations, or both, but it's an insult to the viewer.  Don't waste your time like I did!",1125187200,,1269,4.579646017699115

3961142,3,B002OEBRJ8,"*Ping*

Can you hear it?

*Ping*

It's either the sound of a summer dud, or the sound of your doom.  Which one is it?

Some reviewers have said that this movie is pretty much ""Alien"" set in a cave.  I have to agree with them there.  The same setup is here (Lots of humans are picked off in a dark place by unseen creatures).  The only thing missing is Sigourney Weaver.

While some people seem to hate this movie, I really don't have anything against it.  You've got to admit that this movie does have a really good concept.  A group of cave explorers get trapped five miles underground and try to escape while being stalked by...things that aren't too friendly.

The concept is a great one, and for the most part is pulled off fairly well.  After watching the movie, my initial feelings were that production wise, everything was pulled off quite well.  The cave sets are done convincingly, the underwater sequences are pulled off very well, and the movie does have a feel of gloom and doom to it.

But as for everything else...it's not pulled off quite as well.  The cast gives a solid performace throughout, but none of them are very memorable, save for Jack, who has...issues.  There is barely any charachter development at all, and although the writters do try, it just doesn't work.  One charachter is killed early on who has maybe a minute of screen time and everyone mourns him (""He was special forces!  He knew what he was doing!"")  Then two friends fight for no apparent reason.  Then everyone moves on.

The charachters are basically monster fodder, which is to be expected in a movie like this.  Sure, they're basic stereotype charachters, and you can guess who's going to survive (I was right two out of three), but we're all here to see the monsters right?

You're probably wondering how the monsters come off.  Well, early on you are wondering what they look like, but we don't get our first full look until roughly two thirds of the way through.  Personally, I'm not really for the creature designs, but then again, it's pretty tough to design subteranian monsters.  They do work, but not as well as they should.  I found the explination for thier origin to be hokey and pretty unbelievable.

For a horror movie, there are a few well done scares.  I won't give any away, but rest assured that there were a few moments where I leaped out of my seat.  The most effective scare involves a computer screen, but I won't give anything else away.  I found that the enviornments are the real scare here.  They can be quite creepy if you imagine what inhabits them.

One of the big problems I have with the movie is the editing.  Charachters jump around from place to place with no explination of how they got there.  In one scene, the charachters are at what appears to be a calm, underwater river.  In the next scene, one of them is falling down a current with no explination as to how he got there.  It's not a good sign if you constantly are asking yourself ""How did they get there?""

Probably the most interesting part of the movie involves Jack.  I won't give it away, but it is quite interesting to see exactly where his loyalties lie, and if he's sane or not.

Sadly, the last act of the film falls flat.  The final action piece didint really grab my attention.  Sure there were explosions and running around, but it felt...empty.  And the very last scene of the movie dosent really make any sense, considering what one of the survivors does.

In conclusion, the concept and setting for the movie are the real stars here.  The monsters are okay.  The humans and story are pretty forgetable.  A solid, run of the mill horror movie that has lots of room for improvement.  It's the kind of movie you watch once, then make it better with your own ideas.  I give it an average score of a ""C"".",1125100800,,3801,4.493411420204978
3961143,1,B002OEBRJ8,"i admit, the trailer was hot. Unfortunately the 90 min length film is not. Typical horror monster movie. Eye-candy actors, mixed ethnicity, group of researchers, killed off one by one, fight amongst the actors, etc, etc. This movie is like Anacondas 2. The creatures didn't have enought air time. And when they did, u couldn't really see them in the dark on top of being fake looking CGI creatures. There wasn't any gore or elaborate death scenes. And the ending was so stupid and corny. And i thought Anacondas 2 was bad. Plus, there was dark light/photograpy so the movie was hard to see once it took place in the cave. At least Anacondas had a lot character development.  This year has been nothing but really really bad horror movies and crappy PG-13 Disney horror movies. It all began w/ The Ring 2 and and next will be the PG-13 water-down The Exorcism of Emily Rose.

3961144,1,B002OEBRJ8,"""The Cave"" should have never reached the surface. It is bad beyond bad, yes, even worse than BOOGEYMAN, this is worse than Uwe Bole bad. At least he doesn't take himself seriously. This movie takes itself seriously. It is untentionally funny. and its not a close race, it's far behind it.

I admit that when i saw the trailer I knew it was going to be bad. It looked bad but I just couldn't resist when it came out. I'll also admit, the cinemetography was great. The Cave looked great, with the blue water and the stalagmites, but looks doesn't equal a movie. And this is a good example. The beginning of the movie shows a team first discovering the cave years before the movie takes place. So, I expect to asee them die. All they do is just show them getting trapped inside. Then they go to present day. What a waste of time. It's all right when you start a movie with a scene like that, it worked in halloween, but you got to have DEATH. So what, they got stuck. What about the creatures? I was just shaking my head in what seemed an interminable half hour for the team to even get in the cave. This may have been more of an action movie, and it was bad at that. The finale is entirely laughable as they fight the monsters over fire shooting out all over the cave, trust me, if you see it god help you, but you'll laugh so hard. When I walked out to the bathroom one time during the movie, I laughed all the way from the theater to the bathroom.

 In summary: the cave gives that new subgenre a bad name, considering how great the descent was. Now, I am afraid because if this, that wonderful movie the descent won't be shown in the U.S. At least, no one will see it. What a shame.",1125100800,,1683,4.188271604938271
3961145,1,B002OEBRJ8,"You can tell in this movie that, besides it's a lame script, with lame performances by the actors in this movie, and the fact that it doesnt scare you or thrill you in anyway, that it leaves you wondering....wondering why or why the editing on each scene mostly ended in 5 seconds flat. Granted there are some talented actors in this movie, Cole Hauser (Pitch Black, Tears Of The Sun), Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly, Lost and Delirious), Eddie Cibrian (Tv's Invasion and Third Watch) and Daniel Dae Kim (Tv's LOST and Angel), but please, this doesnt prove anything. So, the story goes like this, some people at the beginning of the movie find an entrance in a church, surprisingly ontop of a mountain structure. They go in, they fall in and it collapses on them. Then, in the present day, scientists find the sight and pick a group of cave spelunkers to go down and explore the mysteries of The Cave...ohhhhh, ahhhhh, not really. So, it's a huge ass cave system with a river running underneath it, but anyway, let's cut the chase and say that there are parasites down there that can infect the host and transform them into creatures and so forth. The cave people want out, so they run around, screaming, and doing all sorts of things till the end battle at the end...yada, yada and so forth. Point being this is a horrible movie, probably one of the worst movies of the year so far. You be the judge people.

3961150,3,B002OEBRJ8,"RELEASED IN 2005 and directed by Bruce Hunt, ""The Cave"" details events when a team of cave divers led by brothers Jack (Cole Hauser) and Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) are commissioned to explore a cave network in the Carpathian Mountains. Unfortunately an explosion cuts off their exit and traps them in the vast network. As if finding a way out isn't difficult enough, they also have to deal with strange vicious creatures living there.

While The Cave isn't anywhere near as good Alien (1979) or Aliens (1986), its competent enough (and should be with its whopping $30 million budget) and similar to those films, except taking place in the alien world of a cave network rather than a vessel in space or an alien planet. Speaking of the cave network, there are some awe-inspiring cave locations and sets.

Except for the opening and close, the entire movie takes place in the caverns. The creatures are an effective meshing of the Xenomorph XX121 in the Alien franchise and the creeper from the Jeepers Creeper films.

I didn't find the characters very engaging, but the story creates some decent suspense around the half hour mark. Although it isn't sustained, things perk up again in a thrilling sequence involving winsome Piper Perabos character and her clash with a monster while climbing. This gripping episode is the main reason I grade the movie as high as I do. Lena Headey is the only other female in the cast.

THE FILM RUNS 97 minutes and was shot in Romania (MediaPro Studios, Bucharest, as well as Zarnesti & Transylvania) and Mexico (Yucatan & Hidden Worlds Cenote Park, Quintana Roo). WRITERS: Michael Steinberg & Tegan West. ADDITIONAL CAST: Other members of the team are played by Morris Chestnut, Rick Ravanello, Daniel Dae Kim, Marcel Iures & Kieran Darcy-Smith.

3961151,5,B002OEBRJ8,"The Cave (2005) with Cole Hauser, Lena Headey, Eddie Cibrian, Morris Cestnut, Piper Perabo, and others (all of which did fine acting jobs with what the material they were given) was a film I really enjoyed back around when it came out. I first really noticed Cole Hauser in the film Pitch Black, and then here, once again he showed that he was very capable of playing a commanding character with an intense look and persona. In The Cave, he does a fine job of playing a leader under duress.

I've since looked at what some of the ""critics"" said about this film and though plenty thought the sets and filming was great they complain about a lack of character development or themes we've seen before. Seems to me they are missing what is a truly an awesome film. No doubt the film is lean on character background or unnecessary dialog, but if you pay attention you get to know things about each character as the action unfolds. And as a movie about an intense survival situation that turns into something more deadly and monsterous, the film focuses on the characters desperate fight to survive and escape. It's well paced, and they don't just blow the whole thing by revealing the creatures too soon. There is not a lot of gore (like there was in The Descent 2006), nor did I notice an excessive amount of ""profanity"" nor any nudity or romance forced into it. Nor did I detect any PC garbage.

One could easily have a double feature with The Cave, and Pandorum (2009), or one of the Alien films.

The Cave is a fun film full of cave diving with gorgeous photography, rock climbing, cave crawling, river swimming, fighting to survive extreme creatures you don't want to get scratched or infected by, or of course attacked and torn apart by. It shows the fantasy of how a different ecosystem might develop sealed off from the known world, and what happens when people come in contact with it. It's exciting, and spectacular looking. It's a good example of what I like in these kind of films. Not a bunch of b.s, they just get it on.

With so much junk out there, this film seems underrated. It was a strong addition to the genre, and a good time for anyone not spoiled or looking for something not really here. I would very much like to see it get the Blu-ray treatment some day.

I review this after just seeing it. My brain is in a state of neutral, or maybe it's shock, as I've literally been staring at the screen for last hour hoping something interesting would happen. It never did.

What's this movie about? Well, a group of people were exploring a cavewith an entrance that's decorated with a flying skull creature. Yes, let's blow up the door with a flying skull creature on it. Let's see what's inside. (Granted, in real life people would actually do this.) Something happens to them and we flash-forward thirty years.

Another group of people have found an underwater passageway in the same area and are looking to explore it. The cast is a who's who of currently recognizable stars. When you're introduced to them, you're thinking, ""wow, all these stars in one movie, this is going to be good!"" What follows is a movie where the cast is picked apart one by one based on how famous they are (with the least famous get killed off first).

It started out promising in the first act, which then feels like some hack finished the last 2/3 of the movie. From that point on, the action is shaky, the editing is disjointed, the mystery of this cave feels as mysterious as your closet. The action was shot in a way where you didn't know which way was up and didn't have reference points to orient yourself; there was no depth to the composition and most things felt flat. The ""creature"" (which is not as big as the posters lead you to believe), started off being scary, no, those were the eels. The eels were scarier than the creature. What was I going to say? Oh, they get picked apart one by one until the end. Then there's a set up for a sequel. The end.

So, what happened? Why were they drawn to this script? How was this even financed? Why was this made? If any of the cast can answer these questions, please let me know (I presume you were low on finances and needed to act in *something*, and this was the least horrible script at the time).

As I finish this, I'm trying to remember if I've seen this before or if it was so bad and unmemorable that I completely forgot about it. I only mention this because I vaguely remember the twist at the end, or was that for another movie? Who knows. Who cares.",1472083200,,2364,4.385844748858448

There are a lot of bro moments - literally, two brothers keep the pack of hopefuls moving in a seemingly hopeless situation. But, what sets this apart is the cinematography and underwater footage that doesn't allow the action elements to be crushed under all that rock.  THE CAVE also has great suspense without the neck-jerking CGI scares that films have become reliant on these days.

The sets and scenes were great! I even commented to my husband about how hard that terrain must have been to work on and in.

Flat acting and bad writing and directing especially in the first half. Dimples and muscles and macho BS.  Formulaic.  Senseless removal of oxygen under water.

3961263,2,B002OEBRJ8,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I popped on ""The Cave"" as this movie flew completely under my radar. Hoping for something like ""The Descent"" I wanted to see where this film would take me.

As the film opens we see a group of mercenaries searching through the ruins of an old church in the Carpathian mountains, The mercenaries are looking for a cave, and just as they find the entrance, their actions cause an entire mountainside to slide down on top of them. Flash forward 30 years and a new group have uncovered the cave's entrance. The see that to access the cave they will need a team of expert divers, so they contact the McAlister brothers, Tyler and Jack to lead the expedition. The McAlister's are extreme divers and they and their team along with several members of the archeological dig head a mile underground to explore the cave, only to find that they aren't alone.

""The Cave"" looks great, and it's obvious someone spent some money on this film, it's just a shame the script is so clich ridden, and that when the action occurs, the director chooses to go with shaky cam and quick cuts so that we can't really see anything. I can understand his choice to some degree though, as when we do see the inhabitants of ""The Cave"", it's pretty obvious where the budget shortcuts were taken. The creatures in the film would be considered poor even by SyFy Movie standards.

It's a shame too, because there are some good actors here; Eddie Cibrian (CSI: Miami), Morris Chestnut (American Horror Story), Daniel Dae Kim (Hawaii Five-0), Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) and Cole Hauser (Pitch Black). The cast doesn't get to play characters so much as ""types"", headstrong thrill seeker, headstrong survivalist, pretty but tough etc. The only character development we get is Cole Hauser's ""Jack McAlister"", and he's basically just playing the Vin Diesel role from ""Pitch Black"".

The movie had potential, but it's a dull slog without characters, and seems embarrassed to tell it's own story, constantly putting the viewer at arm's length from the action.",1414022400,,2053,4.758426966292135

3961272,3,B002OEBRJ8,"I really only this on a whim as I'd heard this was pretty similer to The Descent which I had liked. After viewing it, I can say it is fairly similer but has enough differences to warrant viewers to take it on its own merit. It did feel intense in some scenes, I felt the plot was fairly clever and the creatures look good. The thing that surprised me the most about the movie was how well the cast acted in terms of diving, rock climbing and useing scientific equibment, they all acted as if they really did know what they were doing unlike the descent where all but one cast member seemed to be an amature climber.

Despite that I found multiple problems in the movie, there were too many characters to keep track of. As such it's tough to form bonds with them as they are killed off (however this also made it so I can't really say people behaved stupidly when they die, as if there is more people easier deaths are expected). Also the chemistry while not bad, didn't stir up much again mainly because there were too many people. The ending honestly sucked, they easily could've done the same idea in a better way and finally the way the cast respond to an injured team member really felt stupid (can't say more without useing names which I don't want to).

In the end, it was a fun movie to see, one I bet I'll come back to but not for awhile.",1397001600,,1346,4.25390625

It is what it is, a group of people in a cave trying to keep from ending up on something's dinner menu.  As it so happens, I love this formula; it's tried and true.  I know what to expect and I count on that.  There are absolutely no surprises in this movie (although they do try to offer one concerning the origins of the monsters).  I love the opening ""history"" sequence; it has fabulous camerawork, each image nicely composed.  It's rather abruptly dismissed though, in favor of ""the present.""  The story fairly zips along.  There isn't much for the actors to do, but some do better with nothing than others.  There are few challenges; this won't strain your brain.

But you can watch the cave and not think of these commonalities. If there were a level between B-Grade and A-Grade, that would be where the Cave could be found, I think. We are treated by a lot of familiar faces that combine to a rather surprisingly rounded ensemble cast. The creature design is fairly unique, something between the spaces from what we might expect.

3961306,2,B002OEBRJ8,"If you've seen The Descent you've got an idea of what lurks in The Cave, a film with a similar premise that also was released theatrically in 2005. To wit, explorers conduct an excavation in the mountains of Romania for twelve days. They're supposedly there to do research, but truth be told they are really just mutant bat chow.

Dr. Nicolai (Marcel Iures) and his associate Kathryn Jennings (Lena Headey), believe that the cave could contain an undiscovered ecosystem.  They hire American spelunkers lead by Jack McAllister (Cole Hauser) and his brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) as guides. The diving team includes rock-climbing professional Charlie (Piper Perabo, sporting a sports bra), first scout Briggs (Rick Ravanello), sonar expert Strode (Kieran Darcy-Smith), survival expert Top Buchanan (Morris Chestnut), and cameraman Alex Kim (Daniel Dae Kim). Like all movies of this type, it includes sci-fi levels of equipment, including a modified rebreather system that can allow a diver to stay underwater for up to 24 hours and an Aliens-style SONAR system for exploring caves.

As evidenced by the special equipment, The Cave could easily be renamed The Underwater River due to the sheer number of underwater scenes.  The Cave may disturb audience members who are afraid of the dark - it's filmed in a real cave - but those with hydrophobia will definitely be creeped out. Of course, the real threat is the mutant bats.

SPOILER: The twist is that the creatures in this cave are actually a form of ancient pathogen that mutates its host, and the bat humanoids are actually just other spelunkers in the wrong place at the wrong time.

And so our much-too-fat herd of attractive spelunkers, scientists, and cameramen is thinned out by a roving band of brachiating, flapping predators that use Monster-vision --  err, SONAR - to find their prey.  We get a visual representation of how these things see, which will be important later when of one of the crew uses one of these devices to fend the critters off and the other to blow himself up.  You guess which is which.

The monsters themselves are hulking gorilla-like albino bats with an Aliens-style twist to their features. They skitter and climb convincingly, and they make suitable opponents to the team members - particularly Charlie's standoff, which is one of the few instances of a survivor fighting back.  Mostly, people just get pulled underwater or into a tunnel, screaming as they go.

On the Syfy channel, The Cave fits right in.  It's a serviceable monster movie, but then fitting into the Syfy channel isn't a compliment.",1297036800,2,2587,5.002331002331002

3961312,3,B002OEBRJ8,"There's a deep underwater cave in Romania, begging to be explored, and the only people capable for the job are men with five-o-clock shadows and the girl from ""Coyote Ugly"".  It's easy to know the film is not making a good impression when it begins in the past with a bunch of scavengers getting stuck in a cave and nothing else happens.  That's my overall mood with ""The Cave"": nothing.  Only after I saw it that I clipped my toenails with such thrill did I realize just how bored I was with this movie.

Whereas ""The Descent"" was masterfully made for a cavernous horror, this movie does everything it can to be the complete opposite. ""Descent"" had identifiable side characters and a tragic lead, all incapable of defending themselves; this movie had a pick-n-mix of one-dimensional stereotypes who do mindless action stuff and deliver wooden dialogue straight out of a ""Resident Evil"" game, only without the unintentional humor.  ""Descent"" had a gloomy dark environment, visibly shy to enhance the intensity; this movie did the same, but decided to add the shakey-cam for nausea instead of fear.  ""Descent"" relied strongly on ambient sound so the audience won't expect imminent scares; this movie keeps blasting the shocking music for the entire movie, diffusing any real suspense.  ""Descent"" has the characters go on a trip to cheer up a grief-striken character after an unfortunate event, leading into a psychological process of said character's self-endurance; the characters in this movie are on a mission to inflate their ego and waving their crotch at each other.  You can tell what movie I'm recommending instead.

Here's the thing: there's nothing technically wrong with ""The Cave"", but what's there to be have?  The film is simply built on requirements: it REQUIRES to have someone flirt with the leading lady; it REQUIRES to have two people fighting each other over a dispute during a prevailing crisis; it REQUIRES for someone to question and point out ever single disturbance that's happening; it REQUIRES someone to save a victim from being dragged by the monster, only for the monster to quickly drag it into the darkness.  The film didn't break any new grounds or push the existing elements into interesting directions, just another fluff to be added to the Syfy channel.  It's basically a bowl or rice: edible, but craving for more flavor.",1277856000,,2357,4.969465648854962

3961314,5,B002OEBRJ8,"Cave explorers get lost underground and are stalked by subterranean monsters as they struggle to get out.  Acting is decent, though the casting of a bunch of 20-something models seems rather cliched, ala ""Scream"".  Monsters are effective and convincing, though nothing revolutionary.  Story is simple, as it should be.  Character development is minimal, however, which robs some tension from the film's pace, which the director keeps fairly quick.  Cinematography is polished. Music is competent, if not memorable.

Overall, this film is comparable to its contemporaries, such as ""Descent"", and ""Saw IV"", etc.  Not anything great, but technically slick, and head-and-shoulders above a lot of the made-for-Syfy type stuff.  I give it an undeserved 5th star just to help offset some of the undeserved low ratings given it by wags who seem to hate this film for some inexplicable reason.  Inexplicable, because it just wasn't unique enough, good enough, or bad enough to incite strong feelings one way or another.",1272499200,2,1010,5.30188679245283

3961317,5,B002OEBRJ8,"""The Cave"" is definitely worth watching!!! MUCH BETTER THAN MANY SUGGEST!!!

This is not a complete review of ""The Cave"".  I simply wish to correct some of the incorrect, negative statements offered about this particular film. I had delayed purchasing and watching this film as a direct result of the very cold reviews written for this movie. I am very glad, that I finally decided to spend the whopping three and a half dollars to place a nice copy of the DVD in the mailbox via Amazon Marketplace. No matter what you have read previously, this film will be far better than you could imagine, if you were to base your expectation from most of the written reviews.

""The Cave"" is a ""Science Fiction"" entertainment film, as opposed to a scientifically correct documentary drama. I am absolutely amazed by the luke warm reviews of this movie. This film fulfills the exact purpose which its creators had intended, to deliver visually stunning entertainment for just short of an hour and forty minutes. The acting is much better than most reviewers suggest. The aspects of the explained story which some claim are missing or deficit, simply are not, IF YOU PAY ATTENTION FROM THE BEGINNING (Title Screen) TO END!!!

Some suggest that the audience is not given proper explanation as to why the team of investigators has entered the cave in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania in the first place. THIS IS NOT TRUE!!! Toward the beginning of the film, a group of archeologists and historians are uncovering the ruins of an ancient church building which had been created to seal the entrance to this cave system. The ancient symbols and writings suggest that there are hidden secrets within the cave, and there is much mythology and history of people either trying to keep closure on the cave, or trying to unlock its mystery and secrets. The team leader of the archeologists and historians calls in a team of professional cave divers, rock climbers, a medical doctor, scientist, and cameraman to help with the investigation, as the entrance has been reopened to gain access. THE PURPOSE OF THE TEAM ENTERING THE CAVE, was to electronically map as much of the cave system as possible within a twelve day period, and also, to collect material samples along the way. THIS WAS THEIR ORIGINAL PURPOSE!!!

The team members do show a clear and detectable let down when the first person ""goes missing"" without a clear explanation as to why. They are visibly torn as to continue with the original mission as planned or to turn back, but they know that they need a clear understanding for what happened to their team member. They show angst and tension, as to whether they should or should not continue with the original sample collecting and mapping process which was suppose to take place over a twelve day duration. The entrance which they had entered collapses by way of a peculiar explosion, and the focus and goal of the entire team changes dramatically from that point forward. Placed in this intense life and death situation of needing to find a safe, alternate exit, the tension and adrenaline of all persons intensifies radically. When people start to die through the process of their quest for a way out of the cave system, the remaining members are working at a constant, quick pace to simply remain living before the elements get the best of them. As in many traumatic events, those directly involved may not show vulnerable emotion or shed tears until well after the event is over, and they have a chance to decompress and take in what has truly happened. The emotion which is shown during this process is delivered in the form of tension and angst, rather than sensitive tear shedding. When driven by adrenaline to retain life, this is probably more accurate, than sitting on a rock and crying your eyes out. I do not fault the film, or script, for taking this approach.

Some suggest that we are not given proper explanation as to the origin of the primary creature causing the grief, once again, THIS IS NOT TRUE!!! I don't wish to give away all of the plot points, and many of the basic elements of the other reviews are correct, however, I do wish to correct some common misunderstandings which some seem to have. ""THE PARASITE"" which the lead scientist(Lena Headey) refers to, was a biological bacterial parasite from the environment of the cave, which was interacting with the tissue of the creature, visibly seen through the lens of a microscope. The creature itself was not labeled as such, and would have been considered simply a predator animal, whose origin we clearly understand before the conclusion of the film. Also, the team clearly identifies smaller animals which had evolved in the cave system, and which would provide plenty of food for the larger creatures to feed off of. THIS WAS CLEARLY EXPLAINED IN THE MOVIE!!!

I will agree with many, that Daniel Dae Kim was under used in the movie, given his talent and on screen presence in other works. However, people should remember what his character's role was within this movie ""The Cave"". He played the role of a cameraman filming their mapping and sample collecting expedition. In keeping in line with the story, his input wasn't vital to the story moving forward to the same degree, that say, the character played by Cole Hauser, Lena Headey, Eddie Cibrian, Morris Chestnut, or Piper Perabo had been. I enjoy Daniel Dae Kim, but the simple reality is, that this particular role did not need to share the same screen time as the rest. FOR THE RECORD, Daniel's character screams during the final four seconds of his last scene, not every time that he is on screen, as some had suggested!!!

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS . . . If you are seeking a nicely paced, action filled, visually stunning, all around enjoyable entertainment film, then you should either view it by rental, buy it for less than renting via Amazon Marketplace, or simply buy it new through Amazon and add it to your collection. Worthy of more than one viewing!!! The visuals are stunning on a decent quality HDTV when using a good upscaling DVD player, and of course, the soundtrack sounds great with a multi channel system on the proper setting.

3961319,3,B002OEBRJ8,"I would agree with much of what others have already written. The sets are terrific. The acting is OK - after all the actors are really just doing what the director tells them to do. The problem with the film is that if you start actually thinking while watching it, then it falls apart. There are far too many instances of Hollywood-heroics (something that some writer, or director thinks will look good from a cinematic perspective but which actually make no sense at all). The story line has been done many times - a monster(s) eating up a small group of people who try desperately to escape that fate. It's a theme that allows of almost endless variations and I have no quibble with that. But if you're looking for great originality this is not the movie for you. Take it for what it is - late night escapist fare - and settle back with a big bowl of homemade popcorn. Don't think too hard and it's kind of a fun ride.",1256688000,,921,4.3604651162790695
3961320,3,B002OEBRJ8,"This film has polarized viewers, to say the least...

Lovers of horror and scary-scifi are lured into THE CAVE by its simple title, which promises us claustrophobic thrills. The premise hooks us because it is so PRIMAL: we're afraid of such places - and to make matters worse, frightening creatures are lurking in the shadows and beneath the waters that flow through the cave system. The situation provides a strong engine for such a story.

But ""situation"" is not enough - it should serve as a springboard for memorable, sympathetic characters to say and do interesting things throughout a strong chain of scenes. And that's the problem - THE CAVE seems somewhat lost and confused, sort of like the characters themselves. This is regrettable because, as an audience, we're all geared up: we've suspended our disbelief and we've entered THE CAVE as willing participants. But we don't bond with the characters in this crucible situation the way we do in a movie like Jaws or Alien. They don't unfold to us in a way that draws us in, making us feel what they feel, charming us with their personalities - at least not as strongly as in the greater films cited. I attribute this fault to the script more than the actors. Stronger material might have allowed an actor like Daniel Dae Kim to strut his stuff (whose star rose with the TV show LOST, precisely because its material was so character-driven and excellent), but, alas, that doesn't really happen for any character in this piece.

Still, there are multiple dimensions to a film, and I give a lot of credit to its makers for crafting a gorgeous film. Its look, feel, sounds, and creatures are all outstanding. As a purely right-brained exercise, this movie is fun for the senses. It may not be cinematic filet-mignon, but sometimes one is hungry for McDonald's and can find much satisfaction in a Big Mac. I know I can.

As Stephen King has said, we're all connoisseurs of trash. You've got yours and I've got mine. And so I won't judge this film too harshly. It's a film I bought and have kept in my collection. And something causes me to revisit it now and again, especially when I'm not sure what else to watch. It's fun and it entertains on enough levels for me, at least. Enough that I keep coming back to THE CAVE.

If you haven't seen it yet, I'd encourage you to give it a spin (especially genre fans). It just might exceed your expectations - or not. In any event, I'll part with these words: ""Enter at your own risk.""  ;)",1246406400,3,2484,4.595936794582393

3961322,5,B002OEBRJ8,"Thanks to satellites, practically every inch of our planet's surface has been explored.  However, the earth is hollow and many of its caverns have remained unexplored.  (They are as remote to us as the craters on the moon.)  Who knows what dangerous life forms have been evolving in them since the beginning of time.

  In the remote mountains of Romanian, a chapel was built on top of the entrance to a cave system.  Engravings of winged serpents (dinosaurs?) adorn its walls.  Thirty years ago, an envoy of men drove through the chapel's barricades, ignored its warnings, and violated its inner sanctity.  An earthquake destroyed the chapel, causing the men to fall into the cave where prehistoric creatures were waiting.

  Fast forward to the present.  A team of professional ""cave divers"" have decided to explore a river running through a cavern that connects to the cave beneath the destroyed chapel.  One diver is attacked by a creature, his air tank explodes, and there is a cave in, trapping all of the divers miles beneath the surface.

  The divers must battle scorpions, eels with razor-sharp teeth, and hideous winged creatures as they search for an exit.  Worst of all, there is a parasite that mutates its host, turning it into a creature that can survive inside the dark caves.

  ""The Cave"" is one of the best in the subterranean horror genre.  This science fiction horror gem is action packed from beginning to end.  The body count is high.  There is gore, but not enough to make you feel noxious.  The cast consists of attractive young stars who know how to act.  There is plenty of nail-biting suspense as the characters are constantly pursued through the caves.  Will they escape?  I won't tell, but the film has a nice surprise ending that demands a sequel.

  I watched ""The Cave"" along with three other films that are part of what I call the subterranean horror genre - films dealing with caves, caverns, mines, etc.  The other three are:  ""The Cavern,"" ""The Descent,"" and ""Caved In:  Prehistoric Terror.""  The best is ""The Descent,"" which is pure horror involving six trapped girls who discover blood-thirsty, evolutionary freaks.  ""The Cave"" is a great blend of science fiction, horror, and action adventure.  ""The Cavern"" is a good low budget art film dealing with the horror of being trapped in a cave, alone with a monster.  ""Caved In:  Prehistoric Terror"" is good Sci-Fi cable fare that is horror befitting the entire family.",1237334400,6,2455,4.852300242130751
3961323,3,B002OEBRJ8,"Overall I enjoyed this film, though my reason for picking it up had to do with three of the actors, all of whom interest me variously.  Lena Headey, Piper Perabo and Eddie Cibrian have all made interesting films in the past, and I liked seeing them here.  The film is okay, though I do find some of the action sequences a bit hard to follow, due to the quick pace and the unwillingness to show the creature effects in super close detail.  Perabo needed to do a bit more, she is such a fascinating actor with a very photogenic face.  But what do you expect for a DVD that costs, what, a penny?  How can you go wrong?",1225756800,,615,4.177966101694915
3961324,2,B002OEBRJ8,"The idea for this contemporary horror film is pretty good. Unfortunately, the conveyance is a poor one.

The story is this: A team of high-tech exploratory divers go into a cave and subsequently into the water it holds to effect research. Of course, the place caves in and then they're all stuck inside with a big monster(s). The remainder of the film focuses upon their efforts to escape as team members get mangled one at a time. To add to the suspense, the producers/screenwriters tossed in a female team member but you KNOW that SHE'S not going to get killed!

This is essentially the same theme and idea which was successfully manifested in Jules Verne's famous epic (produced into a fine film),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Journey-to-the-Center-of-the-Earth/dp/B00007JMD8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>, which has also been remade.

What's wrong with this film? IT'S WAY TOO DARK!!! You can't see much that goes on, the viewer gleaning only quick glimpses and flashes of the action. I know that caves are naturally dark but I would have allowed for (and, in fact, would have much appreciated) some ""poetic license"" on the director's part, had he fudged on the brightness a bit.

They cut way too much out of this and left it on the cutting room floor. They cut the story out of it, the depth of the characters and ensured that you did not become attached to them as the movie progressed.

I'm not sure who cast Eddie and Cole as brothers, but they look NOTHING alike, carry themselves nothing alike.  Cole even has a slight accent where Eddie does not.  Don't get me wrong, I like Eddie but Cole Hauser is one of the most underrated actors we have now days.

I've read an interview from Cole and he wasn't happy with the way this movie turned out, so that has to tell you something.  It had such potential, and someone blew it just to save money.

It was short also, only a little over an hour and a half long, plenty of time to make a better, longer movie and the base of a good one was there.  I'm not sure what went wrong.

I love Sci-fi alien type movies.  My two favs are Aliens and Pitch Black, so I'm used to this style, but... nothing.  I'll watch it, for Cole and for hopes that in re-watching it, it gets better, more interesting.

3961326,3,B002OEBRJ8,"This is a classic action-adventure horror flick.  From the opening scene you're already placing your wagers on the 'guess who survives' game.  You can just tell where it's going, and, yes, for the most part who's going to die.  There's nothing that sets this movie apart from all the other horror movies.  And yet, I still enjoyed it.  It did suffer from the too-dark phenomenon sweeping the horror film industry, which is a mark against it, but on the up side it didn't have a lot of gore for the sake of gore (like Saw or Hostel).  The fact that the monster was not really shown also gives it high marks.  The characters weren't great but they weren't awful, so that was a wash.

I'm torn on the very end scene being interesting or just a gimmick, so I'll leave that out of my evaluation.  At first I had the 'oh cool!' reaction, but the more I think about it the more I think it was just that old, trite, last movie scene from so many horror movies.

I enjoyed watching it, but I don't think I'd ever watch it again.  It's an average movie that you'd probably have fun sitting in a group of friends talking and watching (your own MST3K group!) but nothing special.",1216339200,4,1167,4.356481481481482

The plot begins when their first scout investigator finds a creature that he thinks is a form of mole, and some other things like eels. Only they end up discovering there is something much bigger in these caves, and they're stuck with it, with no way out.

The rest of the movie is the group trying to find an escape while staying alive. These caves seem to go on forever with 100 levels or so, but I guess it wouldn't make much of a movie if it was like a regular cave that has about 3 caverns and 12 inches of water.

I found it enjoyable because I was seeking out a horror/thriller movie that was not the typical slasher thing or some kind of supernatural story. This one is more something like a combination of a Jaws predator meets Starship Troopers kind of thing... maybe not Starship Troopers in the blowing things up kind of way and shooting aliens...just more a Jaws 5: In a cave kind of thing.",1214697600,,1179,4.301801801801802

It manages to hold your attention throughout the film, thus I give extra credit due to the fact that my imagination doesn't really dig the whole factor of Aliens, Goblins and Boogiemen.

The movie is filled with horror film clich&eacute;s and the acting leaves something to be desired in places, but I liked the H.R. Giger inspired look and the creatures were cool.

The plot is transplanted from other horror movies.  A group of divers descend into a newly discovered cave.  Once the divers enter the cave, they realize they are not alone, but only after the entrance to the cave collapses and the divers become trapped.  The divers need to escape the cave and the hungry creatures that inhabit it.

Sometimes movies are not so much about the ending, but the journey to get there.  This movie has its moments of absurdity and silliness, but I keep thinking about those charming underground creatures and remember that I can forgive a lot for a well-made monster.  The monsters in this movie are nicely made.  I also enjoyed the cave.  The cave may have been produced on a set, but it was an excellent set.  I should point out that several places in this movie were just short of scary, but did startle me somewhat.

""The Cave"" is hardly breakthrough and the acting was only average.  Yet, I enjoy creature movies and I enjoyed this one.  While there are many better movies, there are also many worse.

3961330,1,B002OEBRJ8,"The Cave (Bruce Hunt, 2005)

After about ten minutes of this mess, it became clear to me that those who criticized Olatunde Osunsami's surprisingly enjoyable The Cavern for being a lackluster ripoff of The Descent didn't have Bruce Hunt's The Cave to use as a reference; if you put The Descent at one end of a number line and The Cave at the other, The Cavern would stack up a lot closer to the former than the latter.

Hunt, whose early resume (second unit director on both Dark City and The Matrix) seemed to hint at great things ahead, takes the director's chair for the first time, but the screenwriters have a much longer pedigree. Michael Steinberg has directed some very good movies (The Waterdance being, likely, the most famous of them) over the years, and he and co-writer Tegan West previously collaborated on another script, the romantic comedy Sleep with Me. Why they decided to try their hands at an underground monster movie is beyond me. They then picked up a cast of has-beens, wannabes, and not-evers, took them to Romania for the basement-budget treatment, and threw them in a cave. Fun!

In any case, the plot, what little there is of it: a team of spelunkers, led by Jack (Pitch Black's Cole Hauser), explore a Romanian cave. They are not alone. (And now you find out why all the hired actors are work-to-scale types: 98% of the movies' budget was spent on a silly-looking creature.) They are also not at the top of this particular ecosystem's food chain. I don't think you can call that a spoiler, really.

I'm not exactly sure where par would be for a basement-budget B-grade monster movie, but wherever par is, just about everything in this movie comes in under it. The locations look like they might be great, but the lighting and cinematography does nothing to play them up in its best bits, and obscures them in its worst. The acting ranges from kind of competent (Morris Chestnut, whose film career ranked as ""very promising"" ten years ago, and has since slipped into, well, doing stuff like this) to just plain silly (Hauser, Piper Perabo, Lena Headey's sillier scenes). The script is blah most of the time, except when it slides into painful clich and cheap titillate-the-audience tricks. And the ending? Oh, you're going to love the ending. Assuming, that is, you haven't seen any monster movie made since, oh, the 1930s. Because if you have, you've probably seen this ending, or a variation on it.

There is nothing wrong with including young and good-looking individuals in a film; it certainly makes the viewing experience more pleasant. Yet, how seriously can I take a movie when there is no good reason for casting this way other than to cater to a certain an audience that cares more about the attractiveness of the cast than the content of the film? This certainly seals its fate as an average (at best) film because we know artistic vision and profundity have been relegated as inferior to superficiality. It is too bad, really, because this story had potential. After the first couple minutes, during which Romanian soldiers stumble across mosaics depicting winged creatures of death in an ancient cathedral, I thought it might turn out to be better than its mediocre reputation. Over the next few minutes, however, I began to get that sinking feeling as the hunky, bland cast was introduced. It then became apparent this would be another clichd, formulaic film. I could forgive the fact it is more or less ""Alien"" set in Earth's underground rather than in space because the production values here are top-notch.

3961343,2,B002OEBRJ8,"OK. In `The Cave,' for the reason we don't really care, one exploration team goes down deep into the cave in the Carpathian mountains and find that they are not alone. In this kind of film, in which we are to watch a close encounter with something horrible, or some creatures (that Patrick Tatopoulos designed), we should stop asking ourselves why these characters do such and such stupid things, or speak such and such silly dialogues That's because we want is, after all, actions, thrills, excitement that you find in masterpieces like `Alien.'

Sadly you don't find them, any of them, in `The Cave.' I can happily ignore the film's ridiculous story about the cave diver team who are so reckless to risk their lives in the subterranean water, but when most actions are far from tension-packed with banal acting and bad editing, their incredible behaviors start to look unwittingly funny. Imagine, if you please, an expedition team member who can casually pick up a huge mole (or huge mouse) carelessly in the dark. Professional, isn't it?  Or how about lovely Piper Perabo fighting with a slimy and deadly creature, who keeps crying with her high-pitched voice? Actually, her scene is the best action of the entire film, the only good one, and still she is too good for this rip-off.

There are good things, though. The underwater images are all beautifully shot, and the film makers are rightly proud of its production designs of the huge cave, which is simply impressive. Cole Hauser is effectively cast as the glum leader of the team, who gives a nice twist or two in the plot, but the rest of the cast is just OK, with Eddie Cibrian, Morris Chestnut, Rick Ravanello, Daniel Dae Kim, Kieran Darcy-Smith, Marcel Iures, and Lena Headey.

But the facts still remains that `The Cave' is routine, borrowing so many things from other superior thrillers, and it is less appealing when compared to `The Descent' much better and scarier film. Both films go deep into the cave, but only one of them gives the sense of danger and tension of being there, and you know which I am talking about if you have already seen it.",1161302400,,2114,4.720867208672087

The film has some amazing scenery and the design of everything used in the film is quite realistic. That shouldn't be all that surprising because according to one of the film's producers, Andrew Mason, the filmmakers hired some of the world's best cave divers as technical consultants. Unfortunately, they must have spent most of their money on those consultations. If you have a movie with realistic locations, scenery, props, but everything else is cheap and fake, you end up with a really bad movie.

After the film's beautifully filmed opening scene, the movie shifts gears and we are introduced to a group of young and attractive cave explorers. But like just about every movie involving a cave, the cave collapses and the explorers have to find a different way out. Of course, they are also being hunted by some sort of carnivorous humanoid creatures. Throw in some mumbo-jumbo that doesn't make any sense about mutating parasites, a nod to lycanthropy, and a ""twist"" ending and that sums up THE CAVE.

The acting is terrible and the few glimmers of decent performances are swamped by the poor directing and bad directing. Even the best actors in the world would have a tough time when they have to face every horror clich in the book. Then there's the terrible dialogue (I don't think a twenty-something women with a doctorate would say ""totally awesome""). Oh, and did I mention the plot holes? Scotty and his team on the original ""Star Trek"" would be put to shame by the results the people on this cave-exploring team can get done with so little equipment and short amount of time. It's, totally awesome!

If you're looking for a crappy movie with some beautiful scenery (shot mostly in Romania), then THE CAVE just might be a picture you might want to see. Turn the volume off and fast-forward through the action scenes and it'll look like you're watching a show from the Discovery Channel. Unless you have an interest in Romania and other than the film's overall design, THE CAVE is better left unexplored.",1158364800,,2202,4.7441253263707575
3961345,3,B002OEBRJ8,"As has been remarked before, you would be forgiven for playing spot the similarity whilst watching The Cave.  If you can imagine The Descent meets Alien, with just a dash of Open Water and The Thing (all of which are undeniably better films than this),  you'll get the general idea.  It also owes so much to Christopher Hyde's brilliant thriller novel Styx, that I was expecting it to get a mention in the credits (it didn't).  So, original this certainly ain't!

On the plus side though, it is a competent and atmospheric chiller which is guaranteed to make claustrophobes curl their toes in extreme discomfort!  It is also superbly filmed amidst a very impressive cave setting (somewhere in Mexico I believe). The 5.1 surround sound is also top notch - those of you with decent home cinema systems are in for a treat.

Without giving away any spoilers, I must confess to finding the ending rather weak and silly though.

Worth watching, nonetheless.",1158019200,,951,4.791411042944786
3961346,2,B002OEBRJ8,"I rented this movie after seeing the more recent release of ""The Descent"" because I had heard people compare the two when I brought it up in conversation. The Cave is nothing like The Descent, only that they both take place in the dark underground. Now, that doesn't make The Cave equal to bat guano, its more like a distant cousin of a better movie. We have a hodgepodge of cave explorers (token black guy, beautiful foreign woman, the girl next door, the handsome rebel, the fearless leader, the old scientist and the other monster fodder that's usually backing them up) The story is familiar, uncharted caves that in the beginning thanks to flashbacks show an ominous presence and make us realize these caves aren't inhabited by just blind albino fish and a Gollum or two.

Bring in the main cast, who are there to stake their claim and map out these unknown systems in the Carpathian Mountains, they have tons of high tech equipment, fancied up re-breathers, cameras, and tight outfits. There is plenty of testosterone, mostly in the form of Cole Hauser as Jack, Eddie Cibrian as Jacks brother Tyler, and Morris Chestnut as Top. The girls who are secondary at best are played by Lena Headley as Kathryn and Piper Perabo as Charlie. The others are just forgettable, although we do have Daniel Dae Kim as the photographer Alex and I only know him because he is on the TV show Lost.

 Basically, it's formulaic, there is curiosity, risk, triumph, confusion, fear, more confusion, discussion, planning, the ""aha"" moment, decisions, and then calm, mix in a lot of death and daring and water and they had a movie. The monster in this, a mutated human being infected with a parasite (of course) wasn't that frightening to me, maybe because it was a rip off of other movie monsters. It had the stealth and camouflage of Alien, they even shot some of the frames exactly like Aliens (it backing up slowly, close up of the mouth, snatching from the ceiling crawling into a space in the wall) It had vision effects like Predator, the scene where they all slide down a waterfall was very much like the Goonies except with broken bones and no pirate ship (although pirates would have been sweet). The creatures were also relied to heavily on the computer and less on the costumes which is these movies greatest downfall, its not scary when you know its not even there with the actors. When will they get this? The ending was pretty predictable, two survive and we realize quickly that one of them has the mutation, if that was supposed to make us as an audience go ""oh my garsh"" they were sadly mistake, I could have cared less, good go mutate it might be a better look for ya.

 By the end of it, I was entertained for an hour and a half; I wasn't scared that's for sure, I would recommend it for the scuba scenes and for Cole Hauser .....Even mutated that man is Hot.",1156809600,,2859,4.565302144249513
3961347,2,B002OEBRJ8,"An Internet thesis - are PG-13 ratings ruining horror movies?  After watching THE CAVE, I thought a PG-13 rating could only have improved it.  I was sure it couldn't be more than PG (I checked the description; wrong, it is PG-13); just look at the content.  Nobody dies on screen - we see an unlikeable character after he is impaled on stalactites and the blonde girl is attacked by a monster, which she kills; in the next scene, she is placed under a tarp.  This is how you shield 5 year olds from death.  Seriously, Disney is more daring than this.  Cursing/inappropriate language?  I heard someone start with ""What the -"" but mercifully it was cut off before any virgin ears were exposed.  No nudity - that's fine, not many movies really need it.  However, the Dr. Lady has her suit sliced open so that the male survivor can do CPR.  BUT, we immediately cut away and see only neck and above.  Either a) Show us the goods, for whatever horror movie logic that demands we see a woman's bare chest at least once or b) Don't slice open a wetsuit in order to do CPR.  The monsters aren't terribly scary; we hardly ever see them and it is pretty dark most of the time.  If I were 5, they'd give me nightmares.  I'm pretty sure 5 yr olds aren't the target audience.

In summary, this is a PG-13 movie with: no on-screen violence, no language issues, no nudity, and the monsters aren't scary.  I keep thinking that some unrated version will popup, with all inappropriate content restored (it's rather obvious in the movie where it was edited out).  IN ADDITION, the plot covers too much ground and consequently loses its focus.  This criticism, above all others, infuriates me.  Any B-grade zombie movie understands this: you have a small group of humans, in a confined and isolated environment, beset on all sides by a deadly enemy, you bring focus and clarity to issues within the survivor population.  Any director that can't focus in this situation is incompetent (or forced to work with an impossible script).

It's not a completely hopeless movie, however.  The monsters were suits and machines rather than CGI, so it at least looks realistic.  The scenery is great.  If this were a Sci-Fi channel movie, it would be outstanding.  As a cinematic movie, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Unless you're under 13.",1156204800,,2309,4.611793611793612
3961348,3,B002OEBRJ8,"""The Cave"" is a sci-fi/horror film featuring caves, water, darkness, and some nasty monsters. As far as stories about caves go, it's no ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"". As far as sci-fi/horror films go, it's not exactly John Carpenter's ""The Thing"". Still, it's very well filmed, fine looking movie, and it's entertaining in places. I think it was all right, actually.

A group of the world's top scuba and cave divers are summonded to Romania by a certain Dr Nikolai to investigate a fascinating underwater cave system. Little do they know that the ecosystem within is full of strange savage creatures, eager for flesh. Little to do they know that these creatures were once like themselves? What changed them?

The locations are very atmospheric and the underwater filming was really well done, especially considering there was so much of it. The dialogue is fairly b-grade, but I don't really mind that too much, it's kind of funny really. The cave creatures are well designed, but I thought they were a little too much like H.R. Geiger's ""Alien"" creatures for my liking. Went on for a bit towards the end too.

Special features on the DVD include two audio commentaries: one from the director, the producer and the effects producer, and the other by the two writers of the film. There's a featurette called ""Designing Evolution"" which goes over the development of the cave creatures, and an 18 minute documentary ""Into the Cave"" which features the two real cave divers who advised the filmmakers of ""The Cave"", discussing. There's a fair bit of underwater cave footage, including some from Antarctica, which was interesting. In this documentary, they talk about the real dangers of cave diving, and though they don't feature monsters, seem pretty scary. I get claustrophobic on a packed train. I don't know how I'd handle being trapped underwater, my oxygen running out slowly...

Though I'd never have the courage to go cave diving, I've always thought it was fascinating. If you're interested in this sort of thing, then ""The Cave"" is worth a look on that level. If not, then you're probably not going to miss much if you pass it up.",1155427200,,2143,4.863013698630137
3961349,2,B002OEBRJ8,"This film begins promisingly enough.  We're introduced to a fairly intriguing premise and the whole notion of exploring a gigantic cave with a humongous - over 90 miles long - river could have been compelling.  It should have been compelling.  Too bad it's not.

As other reviewers have noted, the cinematography, sets, props and general all around eye candy are fantastic.  The main cave set is a triumph of craftsmanship and Disney should hire the builders to ramp up their park attractions.  But basically this is all the ride you'll get.  Expert camera work, great visuals and a set worthy of an Oscar - if Oscars just for sets were given out.

Soon the ""action"" what there is of it, feels forced, and one soon feels claustrophobic.  It's like you're trapped along with these goofs and you start to feel the pressure too, but that's not a good thing.  Basically, like many disposable movies, the characters aren't developed.  Here, they're practically non-existant.  I suspect all work, energy and money went into building that awesome cave set, flying the actors over to Romania and hiring top notch cameramen.  The paper thin screenplay remained strictly an afterthought.

I gave 2 stars because of the DVD's ""INTO THE CAVE"" featurette.  This is the real story of cave explorers.  After the first minute, you'll forget all about the stinky, fake cave goofs and wanna see more of the real thing.",1155081600,,1400,4.86864406779661

3961353,4,B002OEBRJ8,"The idea of being in a cave was a great idea, and this movie shows caves in such beautiful landscapes with sparkling stalagmites and stalagtites, and all the different lighting effects on water and various places of rock formations was so placed to make it seem so real, and yet very viewable.

You need a lot of patience to be able to watch this movie as it is very dark, and it should be dark.  If there is anyone who loved the movie Cube, they might actually like this movie a bit too.  If it wasn't for many of the questionable or blatant foul-ups of the realism of the story, many more people would have liked this movie.

What attracts people to this movie is the action, but most people who like action movies don't like this one, as the action is just a random mixture of someone {almost?- you have to watch to find out) getting eaten up as in other action movies like The Chronicles of Riddick.  Someone who likes movies with more drama may not have been interested in watching this one because it may seem more like an action movie only.  If they somehow added more drama and focused less on the action, maybe it could have been more successful, but it's easier to say than to actually make it, espeically after the fact.

The plot line for this movie does work in the sense that they think of different possibilities of how one could go through the cave.  Though they should have thrown a scene in there which was the same place where ""114"" happened in which the characters recognized that they were there.

Hauser plays his character well as there is a goodness but a creepiness to him at the same time.  He has a deep voice and a young look which makes him sound like a mature, experienced adult.  They give his character sci-fi like qualities, but keep it real, but that hurts the movie because they go nowhere with it and may as well have just kept it out to begin with.  The writers give him these characteristics to show the audience why he acts the way he does throughout the movie, but this nuance doesn't work for an interesting movie even though it's a tiny bit different.

Rick Ravallo plays Briggs, and he was your standard macho guy act.  With Cibrian's experience in Sunset Beach and other soap opera type shows, and with Hauser, Ravallo, Kim, and Chestnut all fighting over the women, they could overdramatized this into one big soap opera to end up with a different kind of movie which probably would have plopped as well, but been much more sexually intense.  It's also very possible these characters would not have taken on this kind of challenge if the script was written as so, but if there was to be a sequel involving a cave, this might be a good direction to try for.

The ending leaves off on a poor note for a possible sequel easily.  It's really bad the way they do it- they may as well have just left it off rather than waste 3-5 more minutes of production.  Great movie for a potential idea which didn't quite hit it, and for some up and coming actors Cibrian, Hauser, Chestnut, and Ravallo.",1150675200,5,3030,4.419064748201439
3961354,2,B002OEBRJ8,"This movie had such great potential! A new beast and a whole new arena! And an interesting story line that was left open (of course) for sequels. That's where it ends.

If there is a sequel, I hope they do a better job.

The bad points:

1. The music. Very misleading at some points. Not even gratuitiously. Too loud.

2. For all the action happening in caves there was no feeling of claustraphobia.

3. Scenes that should have been played tense, weren't. Most times the music got in the way.

4. You never really get a good look at the creature. After all, that's what a creature feature is about.... the creature!

  The good points are that it is definitely an original story line and quite interesting too. This 'cave' has attracted people to it that ultimately never leave, but become the 'creatures'. A bit contrived, but explained by modern science, of course, as a parasite that takes over the body. Bad point to that is there is no real transformation going on in the movie.

  Another good point is the cinematography. Nicely done. Not sure if it is sets of actual location, but very believable. Lighting is carried well too.

  Comparing it to a classic creature feature such as 'Alien', it most definitely lacks the tension where it could have easily been played out. The action happens too fast at times and is hard to follow with the eyes. Should have been slowed down.

  I like the fact that they didn't rely on sped up or slowed down filming, or colorizing any sequels. It appears as though they really did try to be original.

  All in all, if you have time to waste and want something interesting to watch, this could do that.

  But if you're in the mood for real chills and thrills... this isn't gonna touch that.",1147651200,2,1734,4.519354838709678
3961355,3,B002OEBRJ8,"The Cave borrows heavily from far better films, primarily from Alien and The Thing but also from Pitch Black. It has some interesting ideas but overall the story is weak and parts of it are ridiculous.

As pointed out before, why would a predatory creature 'turn' it's prey into competition for it's own food supply? Also, why would a creature that lives exclusively underground in a big cave that is mostly underwater have wings? And once the survivors learned how sensitive the creatures were to sound, it took a long time for someone to decide to use that against them, and then only in a very perfunctory way.

The movie is entertaining enough for a popcorn flick on a boring rainy day (which is how I came to watch it), but it's sub-par in many ways. None of the actors was terrible and they all did as well as you should expect given the problems with the story, the inane dialogue in the script and some very poor special effects.

Not to say all of the effects are poor because some of them are very good, but some are so bad I cringed a bit. It looked like the close-up shots of the creatures used models or actors in make-up, versus some poorly executed CGI for action shots and everything else.

Most of the film is pretty dark and the camera motion made me feel queasy a time or two. Hopefully the practice of jerking a hand-held camera around to simulate intensity or panic will fade away as it's usually just annoying. If you are interested in caving or climbing you're more likely to enjoy this movie as well since they paid closer attention to those parts of the story.

Overall, it's worth a rental if the shelves at your store are nearly bare. I don't understand why some are confused by the ending, Piper Perabo's comment and appearance made it clear that the filmmaker at least hoped to stir up interest for a sequel which would not necessarily involve a cave at all.

Whether alien planet or dark underground caverns, backdrop is important to a horror film, and the location of this film helps to highlight the monstrosities that come crawling out to greet their guests.

The film starts with a group of treasure hunters who break into this ancient church, hoping to discover riches buried underneath the decorative seal on the floor.  After a silly mistake in which they blow up the seal while standing too close, they all fall down.  Screaming.

Later, in more modern times, a group of scientists and cave divers enter, hoping to go where no man has gone before.  They set up a base camp in a cavern while sending a diver through a long, long underwater tunnel to map it out.  Because of a strange message from said diver after he enters the next cavern, the entire team, typical of b-horror, follows.  The tunnel collapses behind them, about the same time our crew discovers they are not alone in the cave.  Trapped, with no communication to the outside and low on food and water, our merry group of mistake-makers must find a way out before they are all eaten.  Rock wall climbing, ice climbing, diving, riding down wild water tunnels and waterfalls, hiding in still pools, escape begins to look bleaker and bleaker as the way out becomes harder to reach.

The scenery and photography are great, the cave is creepy and dark, and the acting, while not memorable, is not as bad as some folks have mentioned.  The best part, as with any monster movie, are the monsters.  Sinister and pale, slimy and toothy, tricky and clever, hungry and unpredictable, its lunchtime underground as our beastly brutes stalk the humans.  There are a few revelations to be made along the way, such as discovering they are parasitical and can fly, the parasitical aspect leaving members of the human team suspect.

Okay, so 'The Cave' is not the kind of movie that will ever be up for an award, and it's not the kind of movie that should be analyzed too closely.  'The Cave' is a movie that you kick back and enjoy with some beer and popcorn, surround sound turned on, and wait for the deliciously bizarre and slimy human-eaters to appear.

3961367,3,B002OEBRJ8,"There aren't any gems in ""The Cave"" but it's also not quite as bad as everyone claims it is. The film swipes its premise from a half dozen other horror films but for a change this doesn't take place in outer space but inner space--in the underwater caves of Romania. It's not quite as memorable as ""Pitch Black"" or ""Alien"" (which itself ripped off its plot from ""It! The Terror from Beyond Space"" among others) and is worth a rental if nothing else.

A group of divers take an expedition into a group of underwater caves, are stranded when a cave in cuts them off from the surface. They discover that they are being hunted by a nasty predator and desperately try to find a way back to the surface before they become fish food.

Cole Hauser (""Pitch Black"")stars in the film and the direction is brisk. The underwater footage some of which is actual footage shot by a second unit diving team is beautiful. The film seamlessly combines film and HD video shot on some of the dives. The impressive sets certainly hold their own and make the film much more impressive than it really is.

The image and sound quality are top notch. We get two featurettes one of which discusses the underwater filming and the divers that do this for a living. It's actually a superior featurette. The second is on the creation of the cave creatures. It's interesting because the approach is much more about why they designed the creature the way they did than how. We also get two audio commentaries. One with the writers who discuss (quite diplomatically I might add)the compromises they had to make to the script to bring it in on budget and that includes the elimination of a couple of truly outrageous sequences as well as more character development and a romantic subplot. The director and producer give a much more production orientated focus to their commentary track discussing production challenges they faced in the making of the movie.

""The Cave"" isn't great art nor does it pretend to be. It's better than something you might see on cable and some some truly stunning stunts and set pieces that make it a worthwhile rental.

I normally stick to only R rated horror movies but after seeing so many ""horror"" movies that got a one star rating from me, I decided to rent a PG-13 rated film. I choose this movie because it seemed to be a good suspense film. I have to say that the acting was good as well as the special effects and this wasn't your low budget cheap movie. Having said that, 90% of this movie takes place in a dark cave where a team of cave explorers are sent to investigate the cave after local biologists believe the cave could contain an undiscovered secret. The secret? alien looking killer creatures. Although great filming in this movie, much of the movie is so dark that you can not make out what is happening. After a while, this movie gets repetitive. The best part of this whole movie to me was the character named Tyler who is played by Eddie Cibrian!!!!!! What a gorgeous man!!!!!! I'll definetly have to check out his bio to see what other movies he's made!!!! My recommendation is to rent this movie if you are a cave lover.... but I wouldn't suggest buying this movie unless you have seen it first and are willing to spend the money!!",1141344000,,1199,4.429864253393665

This movie starts out looking cool, great sets, always love an adventure.. but, then it falls flat on it's face. The cutie pie from the horrid TV show ""Invasion"" is here, still cute as can be. and a few other likable characters. They go on an adventure in a cave below the earth.

First of all, mighty convenient that there is even AIR a mile below the earth surface, that is breathable. not likely. Then the crew is one by one attacked by a mystery creature. I'd stick together, if I was down there. Then, once we see the creatures, was better to not see them. Looked like albino versions of the Alien off the movie ""Alien"" icky and scary.. yup.

Me and my sweet Norman watched this the other night, with a bowl of popcorn, and cuddled with a big soft blankie. He fell asleep, I fast forwarded it to the end, couldn't stand it any longer.

But, I must say, the ending was good. cute.

3961374,4,B002OEBRJ8,"Interesting but not what I expected.  Once again we have a film where great scenes are made for the trailer only.  We expect a movie about a monster in a cave killing off a group one by one.  There is some of that but it s not the real story.

There is a massive cave beneath an Eastern European church.  Cave divers are brought in to check it out and help classify the new life indigenous to the cave.  There is lots of life in the cave which is typical.  But there is more than just life.  Some of it is bigger than any other cave life.  There is even something that is fast and deadly.  Due to equipment failure, the team can not go out the way they came in.  They will have to delve deeper and deeper until they find another way out.

The church has legends of knights descending to the underworld and battling demons.  Could some of that be true?  What are the creatures?  What is so unusual about the ecosystem?  All of that is left to the viewer to discover.  I was a little disgruntled at the sudden ending.  Is a sequel being set up?  What is that one character up to?  (Watch it and you will know who I mean)  Just what does the final revelation, or supposition, portend?  Again, not a bad film just not the one advertised.",1139875200,15,1233,4.157446808510638

I could care less that they died and eventually was rooting for the genetic freaks to win so the movie would just end already.

It's a snappy, well paced, atmospheric, visually arresting, pure action thriller with excellent production values, thoroughly watchable actors, and only as much plot as it takes, not a jot more and not a jot less, to achieve its goal of being immensely entertaining from start to finish.

Just because ""The Cave"" doesn't attempt to be the ""Citizen Kane"" of underwater/underground monster flicks doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing. It's well worth seeing for its sheer entertainment value, with certain scenes -- notably, Piper Perabo's ""cave wall ballet"" sequence and Hauser's chest-smacking mid-air collision with one of the cave creatures -- being a real treat.",1139356800,2,831,5.201492537313433

3961385,2,B002OEBRJ8,"This movie should have been called ""The Cavern,"" because when you tell me a movie is about a cave I expect something more claustrophobic than what we have in this 2005 film.  You say the word ""cave"" in early 2006 and it impossible not to think about the mining disasters that have been in the news.  You look at the cave in ""The Cave"" and it looks a lot more like Carlsbad Cavern, except with the Mississippi River flowing through it or something (the biggest surprise in the film is how much underwater photograph there is for a move that takes place in a cave and/or cavern).  Then again, you watch ""The Cave,"" and it does not take you long to trace its lineage back to ""Alien,"" except this time it is in a cave(rn) underground instead of a ship in space.

That suggests there is not a lot of originality here, which is true, but that is not the biggest crime.  Once you accept the idea that this is a cavern and not merely a cave, then the unique location should have been a bigger part of the thrills and chills (in other words, think ""Cliffhanger"" inside the mountain instead of on top of it, except, of course, for the part that was inside the mountain; but I digress).  Thirty years ago while one party was investigating a cave in Romania, they discovered evidence of an ancient church of some sort and then something bad happened to the explorers.  We then jump forward to the there and now as a new team of explorers enters the cave and we know that most of them (at least) are going to die.

Jack (Cole Hauser) is the leader of the pack, so he is the best bet to survive longest.  Dr. Nikolai (Marcel Iures) has to be around at least long enough to provide the necessary exposition and history, but once he does that his odds dip significantly.  Top Buchnana (Morris Chestnut) oozes confidence, but you know what they say about pride and in the cave(rn) the fall could be a long way down.  Jack's brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian) is along and he is clearly going to be the guy in great danger at some point, while Charlie (Piper Perabo) would be the obvious damsel in distress.  Briggs (Rick Ravanello) and Strode (Kiernan Darcy-Smith) do the heavy lifting for the group and when one of them dies the question will be if you can remember which guy was which.  There is a scientist named Kathryn (Lena Headey), who can carry some of the necessary exposition but who is an unnecessary female since the other actress is more recognizable.  Then there is Kim (Daniel Dae Kim, who I knew could speak English because I watched him on ""Angel"") who takes the video of all the exploring and dying.

They all go off spelunking in the cave, discover some strange animals of the likes no human has ever seen before (except for maybe the ones who died 30 years earlier), and then they become trapped, TRAPPED I tell you.  They think their problem is that they have to get out of the cave(rn) because they will run out of food and water around the time somebody back in the world knows the party is overdue, but really it is that they have to get out of the cave(rn) because otherwise they are going to be ripped to shreds.  However, the great irony here is that the best parts of this film are when nothing is happening because instead of looking at the people we do not care about or the things that are doing the killing, we can appreciate the cave(rn).

They found the church ...and something very unholy. During an avalanche that miraculously happens upon their arrival at this defunct holy shrine, the men are dropped into a cavern, a cave really. And something insidious is waiting for them.

Skip ahead to the present day and we find a group of excavators moving rocks away from the buried church. They discover the cavern beneath it, and within the cavern is a labyrinth underwater tunnel system. Lakes, streams, rivers, and dangerous curves. So they call in the world's foremost cave diving experts to help explore the area.

Once inside the cave, the divers patrol its waters and discover strange creatures, like slimy moles, slithering around. But are these things at the top of the food chain down here?

As the cave diving crew drops further and further into the cave's depths, members of their team gradually disappear in a most unappetizing fashion. Humans are NOT at the top of the food chain. Not down here.

And did one of those creatures have a tattoo on its ...um ...whatever that is? Is that the same tattoo we saw on one of the Romanian soldiers thirty years ago?

______________________________________________________________________________

It's just too easy to bash the hell outta this film, so I will. Ready?

First, the characters. I didn't know nor care about any of these putz's. Cole Hauser (who starred in PITCH BLACK) plays Jack, the leader of the dive team, and it is he who first finds the larger man-eaters that live beneath the surface. But his character - indeed all of the characters - are so underdeveloped that you might cheer as they get killed off.

Second, the plot. Exactly what was it? Was it about a creature trying to escape its cavernous cage (as the ending suggests)? Or was it a kill-off style film in the vein of ALIEN, ALIENS, and PITCH BLACK? I'm not sure.

Third, the creatures. An obvious steal from the aforementioned ALIEN and PITCH BLACK (big jawed teeth like ALIEN and the sonar capabilities from PITCH BLACK).

Fourth, the science. It take eons for evolutionary changes in any species, but the makers of this film would have you believe that it could happen via a parasite in a matter of hours or days. Come on!

The only (partial) saving grace for this movie was the underwater camera work. The caves were beautiful and shot in high definition. But, unfortunately, we don't see enough of this and only get zinged with killer Pitch Black Aliens.",1138320000,8,2582,4.832199546485261

There is only ONE good scene, when the women is trying to swing from cliff's edge to edge to escape from one of the aliens. It's a nice, big visual scene as she swings and there's genuine tension.

3961391,3,B002OEBRJ8,"It's slightly above average.

A bunch of explorers are trapped after a cave-in, and find themselves being stalked by some kind of large creature.  A survival story that takes place in essentially a tube (underground cave) is bound to be a fairly simple plot, so don't expect too much. But they do work in a couple simple devices beyond the fight for survival.

Cliche run-down:

 - Hot babes... Two of them, but niether are the typical horror ditz or the typical female hero.  The real story are the two brothers, what little story there is.

 - The one black guy... Doesn't get killed.  We are spared from the questionable trend of ""the black guy always gets killed.""

 - Gratuitous romance you didn't ask for... Not here.  The setup was ripe for it, with two babes and at least two very outgoing men. But once again, the audience doesn't have to sit through another one of ""those""

 - Lame attempt to be scientific... Yes.

 - Greedy corporate guy... Almost, but no.  This ""we still need to make money"" conflict lasts about 5 seconds and is cut short with a rather satisfying exertion of authority, never to be heard of again.

 - The wise old man... Sort of, but he doesn't play a major part in the plot or make many lame philosophical admonitions (this whole movie is pretty safe from that).  In fact, he doesn't always even offer the best advice.

 - ""Overview"" pan-out end visual... Two of them!  You know the type of end where the camera pulls back to a view of a large area, often from high altitude, as if you just saw something epic.  A visual replacement for a lack of intellectual grandeur.

Low points:

 - Directing. Some transitions are too quick.  Some scenes where people are backtracking are hard to follow for a few seconds because you don't see recognizable areas when you should.

 - Questionable science.  Sure it's a monster movie, but like many horror flicks this one tries to explain things a little too much.  They should have trimmed this down a little more like they did with other cliche elements.  It may have been an even better movie if they let the audience figure out the general idea as it became obvious rather than getting too descriptive and pretending it made more sense than it did.

High points:

 - Sets.  Most of it looks real.  More work, or maybe just more brains, went towards the cave than the script or directing.

 - Action.  It's a fair amount of violence and brutality.  Not the best movie for this, but you won't feel like it was lacking.

Monster review:

Not bad. It's primarily a mean beast.  It kills with claws, teeth, and general ripping apart.  It's tough, but can be killed with simple objects.  It's powers are mainly physical, in some cases a little too extreme, but no magic or supernatural garbage.  For much of the movie it is given adequate shroud to avoid the anti-climactic over-exposure many monsters suffer from.  Unfortunately it is displayed a little too much in a few scenes at the end.  Alien and Predator are among the very few movies in which a clear closeup of the beast is satisfying and even more terrifying than the suspenseful dark scenes.  The Cave is not.

Ending:

In order to not give it away, I'll just say there are some unanswered questions but no more than in the rest of the movie. It's pretty clear what happened, but much like the first couple minutes to the movie, the last couple minutes are fast and choppy.",1137801600,2,3402,4.5647840531561465
3961392,5,B002OEBRJ8,I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan and I believe without a doubt that this was the best true Sci-Fi film that I've seen in years. It has a great storyline and the acting is good with relatively unknowns. I highly recommend this film to any Sci-Fi film fan out there!,1137715200,8,253,4.183673469387755
3961393,4,B002OEBRJ8,"This movie rocked!!! I was completely taken by surprise with this one. I remember seeing the previews earlier last year and thought it showed some promise, I guess it did rather poorly by way of box office and that's a real shame, alot of people are missin' out on a real fun, exciting movie. I had a top 10 for 2005 already done, but I may have to go back and revise it a bit, and slip this baby in at #10, I enjoyed it that much.

I don't think I saw a better looking movie this past year, the sets and locations are amazing. The cave itself is sensational, giant, beautifull but creepy. The work that went into the presentation of the whole underground cave and its depths is really first rate. The special effects are very well done and the photography and picture are excellent, they could have had a disaster shooting this, but the camera-work really comes off sharp and scary.

Another surprise was the cast, Cole Hauser plays Jack, leader of a team of professional cave explorers who are hired to go looking for a new ecosystem in this recently discovered cave. Hauser did rather well as the lead, just as he did in his last under-rated and under-appreciated movie, Paparazzi (3.5 stars) His brother Tyler, played by Eddie Cibrian, who I recognized, but just couldn't place (I hate that) is also on the team. The notable stars for the rest of the crew are Morris Chestnut (huge arms, but still not much of an actor) Lena Headey, and Piper Perabo (she of Coyote Ugly fame) I was also impressed with the strong bond they showed between the brothers, although they have a few disagreements here and there,they are there for each other to the bitter end.

The team dives 1 mile beneath the surface and comes face to face with some parasite/predator that has thrived in isolation and has a craving for human blood. We get kind of a weak explanation towards the beginning that they mught be ancient demons who protected a church that housed the opening to the great cave. But it really doesn't matter, I'm sure some reviewers might have a problem with the plot-holes, but I was just just having too much fun to care.

There is a scene when Piper Perabo is climbing up part of the cave and is confronted by one of our 'creatures'. It is incredible people, the imagery and Piper's fine acting combined to give you a very memorable and scary scene. Now, I have read a couple of reviews and let me tell the rest of you, ignore them, watch this, you will have such a great time. It is both scary and suspensefull, also well acted and directed, with stunning scenery and a plot twist with our leading man Mr. Hauser that I thought was very clever.

Any flaws? very few, not really worth mentioning. The end will be  thought of as silly and contrived by many, and I guess I can sort of see why, but it fit for me. Also, a couple of the lesser used memebers of the team are rather bland, but they are not in it much so it's ok. There really have not been many good sci-fi/horror movies in the water since Leviathan, Deep Star Six, and The Abyss, so do yourself a favor, check this one out, you won't be sorry. Until next time ya'll!!!!!

acting........3.5 stars, Hauser and Perabo are good, but the cave is the real star here.

directing......3.5 stars, I'm not too familiar with Bruce Hunt, but I might after this

special effects.....4.5 stars, Just awesome, the cave, the creatures, underwater, it's all terrific.

It's not a movie that I would watch over again, but there was so much suspense and tense situations that it kept me fixated to the screen. I also had to know what the origin of these creatures were. They look to be a cross between Aliens and ...Bats.

I'm still not sure where they evolved from. Are they winged demons from Hell, which is what I think the Templar Knights described in the Church writings; did subterranean organisms evolve that could infect and mutate other organisms it encountered; or did some meteor with alien parasites crash land on Earth? The set of the cave is beautiful, the creature special effects are decent, and there's plenty of suspense that keeps the viewer wondering how the cast will escape.

I didn't give a higher score because I didn't care much for the character development. They seemed like a shallow cast meant for a Scream or Nightmare on Elm Street movie.",1137628800,,970,4.694117647058824

The movie is rated pg-13 so it's not really scary but it has sacry moments. The movie is also an adventure movie and intersesting at times.

Well I'll say the two strong points in this film is first and foremost the cave itself. How fascinating the scenes are in this movie when it comes to the cave- this part of the film creeps me out through its darkness and just the ominous feel it gives. Great strength in the scenes- and also the whole history behind the cave I felt was very interesting...but that is basically it and these two points cannot save the film.

For the weak points- such as the acting itself, how the actors play out the storyline, and the monsters themselves are just downright non- interesting and had me bored not too long into the film. I found myself fast- fowarding through most of the movie, just watching the interesting parts, which were not much. This movie just held no excitement factor, I don't know how else to explain it. It just did not catch me as interesting except for the cave scenes. So I would not recommend this film and would advise people to pass by it for there are much more captivating and thrilling movies than this one.",1137369600,,1147,4.410377358490566

Somewhere buried deeper inside this movie may be the idea for a good horror movie. Unfortunately, no one in this film would know what to do with it if they found it even if there were a hundred cave explores and/or scuba divers. There is not one second of horror, one second of suspense, nor a modicum of anything remotely horrifying. The film is supposed to take place in an immense cave with oodles of scary cave type creatures lurking about, but for all intents and purposes it could just as easily have been filmed in your bedroom closet. Maybe it was.

On hand we have Cole Hauser who after having recently starred in the film Paparazzi decided to try and hide from that previous embarrassment by becoming entombed here. And when I last saw Morris Chestnut, he was battling giant serpents in another misguided misadventure known as Anacondas. No, it's not true that the snakes swallowed him and spit him out into The Cave. Snakes aren't that cruel. But if you're going to make bad movies, my mother always told me you might as well do them in bunches. The rest of the cast are largely unknowns except maybe for Piper Perabo who manage to wangle this gig in between Cheaper by the Dozen and Cheaper by the Dozen 2. You know her career has been on fire ever since giving such a memorable performance in Coyote Ugly. But you have to take what you can get when you can get it I suppose. It makes no difference. You could plug in any number of has-beens and wannabes into a film like this and nobody would notice. That's probably what this cast is hoping for.

After starting with a silly needless and unnecessary prologue to set the film up and let us know that Yes, Virginia, there really are spooky mysterious caves with horrible creatures, we meet our fun-loving undersea cave exploring crew.

Quickly we are given an explanation to let us know who the leader of the gang is, who his brother is, who the irresponsible one is, and which of the two females will somehow survive for ninety-seven minutes. The only member of the crew that seems to be missing is Scooby-Doo. Then we're off to Never-never cave.

In short order our crew becomes cave creature bait and began to get plucked off one by one. That is except for Jack (Cole Hauser) who suffers a nasty bite and slowly begins to morph into one of the creatures. Hauser then walks through the rest of the film as if the trauma from being bitten means to act like one of the walking dead from George Romero's zombie movies. I take that back, there was no reason for me to start insulting zombies.

We do get to see the cave creatures climbing around, flying around, crawling around, jumping around, and swimming around in the dark. Occasionally we even get to see a blurry close up of them and I could have sworn they were creatures who have been looking for a gig since Alien: Resurrection. It could have been left over stock footage from one of those films but that might have been an improvement this film couldn't afford.

As we see Jack getting a little wackier and more wackier we and his companions are left to decide if he is really trying to save everyone, or have them become varmint fodder. We know Jack is getting a little bit balmy because I think a million dollars of the budget went into special effects on his eyes to let us know this for certain.

The fact is whatever happens to this assortment of adventurers we don't care. We know nothing about them from start to finish, and their only purpose is to be served up as a smorgasbord. We could almost forgive that if director Bruce Hunt had done something to build up any suspense or surprises along the way but he doesn't. Sure it's a cave, and it's supposed to be dark, but incredibly it's only really dark when you want to cover your cheap special effects. Hunt's previous work has come as a second unit and third unit director on The Matrix movies. He obviously shed his training wheels a bit too soon if The Cave is any indication of future work.

The fact is that I might have let this film slip by with a two vote. I mean really, I'm a generous kind of guy. But then someone decided that being bad just wasn't enough. They had to tack on the usual obligatory sequel setting ending and if you have read anything on here I've written about those kinds of endings you know what that means. It means you get one of your stars taken away which is the real reason I only gave it two stars. Amazon does force me to leave you that one. And when I'm forced to do that, I have no choice but to give you my grade and that grade is an F, marked in red, circled and underlined and tossed back into the pothole that this film crawled out of.",1137110400,5,4973,4.396739130434782
3961399,5,B002OEBRJ8,"Let me start out by saying that I'm about as big a sci-fi fan that you will find anywhere and I've seen them all. With that in mind I'm little confused on what basis some of these other reviewers are using in order to review this film... as in regard to the poor reviews.

  I guess I'm old school when it comes to Sci-Fi action with likes of cult Sci-Fi classics such as Forbidden Planet, the Thing, Alien, Mimic, Leviathon, the Relic, Pitch Black, etc. Following in that category I personally believed this to be one of the best Sci-Fi action-thrillers to come along in many years and trust me...I've seen some very bad ones.

  First thing to consider with the Cave is it's very original considering over the past 50 years just about every type of plot & senerio has been done, re-done, and done again with a different twist. If you are an old school Sci-Fi fan you can see how the Cave might have been influenced by some classics of the past, but it undoubtedly stands on it's own merit. I don't want to get too in-depth on this review because I would hate to play spoiler and give away to much of the premise as I could easily do. I'll just conclude by saying that if you are partial to comedy movies then you might not care for this film.... If you are partial to love storys and/or ""girlie"" type movies you might not care for this film.... If you are partial to deep psychological thrillers then you might not enjoy this film....If you are partial to hardcore gore slasher flicks then you might not care for this film... If you believe yourself to be a big fan of Sci-Fi thrillers then you will LOVE the Cave.

  To the Sci-Fi fan out there an important thing to keep in mind in regard to this film is that this type of movie as well as those listed above appeal to a very limited viewing audience. I just so happen to fall right into it. Most Sci-Fi films that have become ""cult"" classics where originally received very poorly from moviegoers....perfect examples would be the Thing with Kurt Russell & Pitch Black with Vin Diesel. Both recieved weak reviews and since have garnished cult status and will continue through generations. Among many apsects that gave this movie high marks with me is an assumed conclusion by the viewer within the last few minutes that suddenly & unexpectedly changes then leaves the ending open to the possibility to a sequel.",1136764800,60,2364,4.47906976744186

3961401,1,B002OEBRJ8,"The Cave may have been a decent popcorn flick if it wasn't a blatant rip-off of ""Pitch Black"", to the degree that it has one of the same actors in it. Instead of some unknown planet that gets real dark, and creepy crawlers come out, you're  underground in a cave and in underground river-systems. Its a really bad movie on its own as it is, but even more so when you realize that it is a rip-off. One or two neat scenes (Piper Perabu's cliff-side sprint and jump is admitedly cool) are not enough to make it worth watching. To make matters worse, it appears to end by setting up a potential sequel. God help us.",1136592000,3,611,4.267241379310345
3961402,2,B002OEBRJ8,"I'm not just talking about the cave in ""The Cave"" when I mention dark, dank, and dull, I'm talking about the acting, the direction, the special effects and the action as well.  In fact, the cave is actually pretty impressive at first, but if you've seen any shows on National Geographic about caves, you get over the awe inspired by the setting of this tale rather quickly.  Sure, the cave is actually a set and not a real cave, but you'd think that they'd have spent more money and time in developing the actual story.  The plot is the biggest hole in this snoozer.

In it, a cave-diving team lead by Cole Hauser and Morris Chestnut delve into a cave in search of a new type of ecosystem.  The crew of divers and scientists quickly begin to go missing as their entrance into the cave is cut off and they attempt to find a new escape route.  Hauser is attacked by a creature but manages to survive.  Slowly he begins to transform into something that has super-sensitive hearing and very strange eyes.  As the story plods along, the group has to decide whether Hauser is leading them to their deaths or to safety.  His brother, played by future SciFi channel leadman Eddie Cibrian, and Chestnut are the only crewmembers who believe that Hauser's intentions are good.  The story plods along some more, people die in dark, cloudy action shots full of close-ups and a tad bit of blood and along the way they figure out exactly what is after them and how it affects them.

Besides Chestnut, the only recognizable actor in this entire flick is Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly).  Though I've never watched ""Lost,"" I gathered from another reviewer that the Asian guy in this flick is also on that show.  Anyways, this cast is rather dull as a whole.  Character development isn't present in any sense other than the fact that we establish Hauser and Cibrian as brothers.

The creatures look like rip-offs of ""The Thing"" and ""Alien.""  In fact, this story is a rip-off of those two flicks as well, though it lacks the suspense of ""The Thing"" and the better creature design of ""Alien.""

In all, I wouldn't recommend this DVD as a purchase.  I rented it and felt a little bit cheated by this flick.  There are much better films found on the SciFi channel, and that's saying a lot.",1136505600,5,2261,4.538271604938272
3961403,3,B002OEBRJ8,"Here's a crazy thing... Before this movie started on the DVD, they showed the MPAA rating. Next to the PG-13 rating it said: Rated PG-13 for creature violence.

Creature violence! How great is that? The MPAA used to just base their ratings on potboiler terms like: violence, nudity, sexual situations. Now they've actually given creature movies their own rating system! I wonder if this was the first movie to be rated for creature violence. I never noticed it before, but I thought it was noteworthy. Anyway...

In THE CAVE, a bunch of wacky spelunkers decide to descend into some mysterious caverns and awaken something terrible. It's a fairly standard set-up for a horror movie, but what THE CAVE has going for it is that it combines two different types of creature movie into one.

The movie starts off in standard fashion. The story of Ten Little Spelunkers who start disappearing one by one. In the brief glimpses we get of the creature, we are led to believe that it might be some big mutated bat. I know what you're thinking, sounds pretty lame. I was in the middle of rolling my eyes and picking at my navel lint when the movie took an unexpected turn.

Okay, now here comes a big spoiler. If you intend on seeing this movie and you want to be surprised, stop reading now. But if you're curious as to why I went from being bored to being pseudo-entertained (and why you might have the same experience) then read on...

See, the monster that's prowling around down in the caves is actually a parasite that gradually transforms its host into a monster. The guy who gets bitten/infected is played by an actor that I've seen before but I can't remember his name. He's kind of like the poor man's Tom Berenger. Anyway, he gets infected and starts transforming into something more than human. His fellow spelunkers are all worried about him as his pupils turn all funny and his hearing gets extra sharp. If you remember how that one Marine went all buggy in THE ABYSS, it's kind of like that.

In horror movies you usually either have an external enemy, and everyone has to band together to fight this horrible thing. Or the enemy is within, and everyone has to figure out who the killer is inside their little group before they all get sliced and diced. This horror movie has a little bit of both. It's about an external enemy and the enemy within. That's what I liked about it.

Luckily for our plucky spelunkers, budget Tom Berenger decides that he's going to go against the creatures that infected him and help his cave-climbing comrades get to safety. It's all fairly reminiscent of PITCH BLACK if Riddick had become infected by one of the creattures. Despite its predictability, THE CAVE winds up being a notch above your basic creature flick.

And it's rated PG-13 for CREATURE VIOLENCE! I can't get over that.",1136505600,3,2820,4.64859437751004
3961404,5,B002OEBRJ8,I read some the prior reviews on this movie and I disagree with most of the negatives. This is a Science Fiction thriller in it's original sense and NOT a horror movie as most seem to be evaluating it on. The Cave represents exactly what Sci-Fi is all about and it is without a doubt the best original Sci-Fi thriller that I've seen since Pitch Black & prior to that the Relic. If you are a true fan of Sci-Fi thrillers then there is no doubt that you will enjoy this movie. I've been a Sci-Fi film fan my entire life and I know a bad film when I see it. The Cave stands out high above any that I've seen in recent years.,1136505600,7,621,4.016129032258065
3961405,1,B002OEBRJ8,"I have overheard many horror fans recently refer to ""The Cave"" as one of the very worst monster movies to come along since ""The Relic."" The fact that ""Relic"" is unfairly trashed so very frequently leaves me scratching my head in utter disbelief. I barely managed to finish sitting through ""The Cave"" this very evening, and it makes me cherish my memories of ""Relic"" all the more. You want bottom-of-the-barrel bad? Look no further, friends, because ""The Cave"" will not disappoint! This, quite honestly, makes anything by Uwe Boll seem like Shakespeare!

A vast underground cavern, nestled deep within the rocky nooks of the Carpathian Mountains, serves as our main point of focus. We, the viewers, are expected to believe that a group of cave-divers that do nothing but whine and fight have been working together for years on end! If you can get past that hilarity, you then have to contend with a script that meanders and drags for an excruciating eternity before you ever get to see anything of real interest. The action is all quick-cut and very hard to follow, meaning you never really get a good enough look at the monsters or the carnage they bring to our heroes. About the only real merit I can give this effort is the set design. That, I must say here and now, is nothing short of outstanding. The mood it generates is certainly very creepy, but is unfortunately not enough to save this soggy and altogether frustrating failure.

""Relic"" benefited from good writing, tight pacing, and bone-chilling thrills. Everything ""The Cave,"" I should mention, is sorely lacking.",1136419200,6,1575,4.851301115241636
3961406,4,B002OEBRJ8,"Have you noticed how many horror films are being filmed in Romania these days?  Producers have gotten wise and decided to set these movies in that locale to enhance authenticity.  THE CAVE is another movie set in the Carpathian mountains, and for a film of its ilk, it's a decent thriller.  The movie opens in the 70s with a spelunking crew investigating a mammoth cave deep in the Carpathians and their ultimate dastardly fate.  Switch to present day and another crack team of spelunkers is summoned to investigate the same cave.  Of course, things go horribly awry when a cave in seals them in the subterranean depths and they find they are NOT alone, as some kind of horrifying creature starts picking them off.  Add to this a nasty parasite that just might have affected the team leader and you are set for the ultimate confrontation.

The creatures are reminiscent of HR Giger's classic ALIEN, with some plotlines stolen from THE THING.  The acting is unremarkable but serviceable:  Cole Hauser, Eddie Cibrian, Lena Heady, Piper Perabo and Morris Chestnut being the most recognizable of the stars.  The cave setting built on a Romanian soundstage is quite impressive and the movie has its share of jolts, including its twist ending.

Though it was actually not quite as bad as A Sound of Thunder, the Cave was laughably bad, and belonged more on the Sci-Fi network than in theaters.

The concept here is really simple, and the look of the movie is pretty decent.  However, the acting and the story just destroy everything that the movie had going for it.  I stayed through the credits to find out the one actor's name.  Rick Ravanello puts on one of the absolute worst performances in movie history!  The dude could not act to save himself!

The movie goes from bad to worse during the rock-climbing scene. The sequence of events in that scene really don't make any sense at all, and I seriously burst into laughter at how bad the whole scene was.

This really was a rather awful movie.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes bad movies...there is a lot of humor to be found if you don't take it seriously.  But as a whole, this one gets the big thumbs down.",1136332800,2,1062,4.4
3961409,2,B002OEBRJ8,"While on my Christmas vacation from work between the holidays of Christmas and New Year's I had plenty of time to sit down and catch up on some much needed movie watching.  Out of all of the movies I sat down to watch, most were very good, some examples would be ""Into the Blue"", ""Wedding Crashers"", and the always entertaining `Star Wars' saga, but one film that stood out as lackluster in my eyes, was the monster movie ""The Cave"".

""The Cave"" is set deep in the Romanian forest, where a mysterious cave (hence the name of the movie), has captured the attention of a team of professional cave explorers.  Leading the team are Jack (Cole Hauser) and his brother Tyler (Eddie Cibrian), with the help of their crack-squad of spelunkers, which also includes Charlie (Piper Perabo) and Buchanan (Morris Chestnut), the team begins their exploration of the mysterious cave.  Years before the team arrived another group of people had gone to the site and never returned, which has caused this current exploration to discover what happened to the previous group, and to discover what, if anything is behind their disappearance.  But what the team finds just may be more than they bargained for.

""The Cave"" had potential to be a very good monster movie.  The atmosphere was eerie, the actors were talented, and the production values appeared to be moderately high.  However, the problem this film ran into is that the story never draws you in.  You don't get a sense of respect/liking for any of the characters, and so when danger arises you are left with no feeling one way or another towards what happens to the characters.  The story is decent, it does borrow on previous monster/alien movies, such as ""Pitch Black"" and ""Alien"", but at least the movies it borrowed from were entertaining, which is something I can't say for this movie.  Another problem with this movie is that it appeared to be forced into the constraints of PG-13, so that the action is always hidden in the shadows.  This can prove to be a useful technique when properly executed, it provides a sense of dread and allows the director to avoid showing blood in order to meet certain restrictions, but instead it fails to evoke any sense of fear and dread, and makes parts of the film difficult to follow.  This is due mostly to the quick cuts made in the final edit of this film, where everything involving the monsters is somewhat blurred together in quick flashes.  I've never heard of the director of this movie, Bruce Hunt, not that this brings the movie down in any way, but if this is any indication as to what we can expect from future outings by this director, he may want to be wiser with his choice in material.

Overall, I found ""The Cave"" to be disappointing and unengaging, which is sad given the acting talent, but sometimes even good actors aren't enough to save a movie.

""The Cave"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.",1136332800,4,2904,4.6647058823529415

Thus these explorers are really just chasing explorers from 30 years ago, who perhaps wanted the transformation.

The movie fails is every way imaginable.  Watching it makes you appreciate other B grade flicks like this, that somehow capture your imagination, or are in some way suspenseful.  Making movies is not easy, and ones like the cave make you appreciate that fact.",1136246400,2,593,4.821782178217822

As for a couple of hour diversion, The Cave was fine.  I came in with fairly low expectations and walked away feeling satisfied.  I don't understand all the negativity towards it.

If you buy the DVD, don't expect a megabuck blockbuster flick.  It is a fairly low buget movie that put most of its money into really classy sets.  Aliens, it ain't, but for spending a fun night in front of the TV, The Cave meets the bill.  There are many, many horror movies that are really terrible.  I just don't think The Cave fits that bill.

3961414,2,B002OEBRJ8,"As an audience member, there is nothing more frustrating than when a film with an intriguing premise fails miserably to present an appealing, or in this case horrifying, story with an intentional direction. With direction, the audience gets a purpose, a sense of reason for watching the film. When the reason fades away, the interest in the story wanders in different directions. One possibility is to begin the nitpicking of the flaws within the film while others might simply cease the viewing. The Cave presents a captivating introduction that in due course abandons the viewer in its feeble attempt to fight for survival.

The Cave begins with a fascinating flashback into the Cold War in Romania some 30 years ago, which introduces the audience to the scary element of the story - a deep cave. After a difficult climb up the Carpathian Mountains, a group of treasure hunters arrive to their destination, a remote and long forgotten church. An ancient and secret atmosphere seems to linger around the church, as these men enter the religious domain. The walls of the basement have ominous reliefs of fanged and horned human skeletons while the floor is dressed in an extensive arabesque portraying demonic creatures. The audience must be brain dead not to sense the overwhelming atmosphere of lurking danger combined with the history vampirism in the Carpathian region. Despite the symbols perilous horror, the treasure hunters detonate a bomb to examine the possibility of a treasure, which leads them to a gigantic cave system below. This leaves the viewer with a potent tone that almost anything can appear from the depths of the Carpathian Mountains.

Swiftly the film switches gears, as it jumps to present time. The geological scientist Dr. Nicolai (Marcel Iures) has uncovered the old cave system, after fallen rocks covered its opening 30 years ago. Once below, he discovers that the cave system has several sections underwater, and he therefore hires the best cave divers in the world to help with the exploration. Jack (Cole Hauser), the cave diver's leader, eagerly accepts the assignment with his crew's mutual approval. However, they would not have accepted the assignment, if they knew what evil dangers were lurking in the seemingly bottomless cave.

The opening creates a good base for a story, which is about the only thing the film has to offer. With the build up the story had numerous alternative directions to choose from, but predictably, the expedition turns into a hide-and-seek horror tale that follows a similar path of the 1979 sci-fi horror film, Alien, which caused mass panic throughout the American theaters during its initial release. Unfortunately, The Cave does not provide this kind of experience, even though the initial suspense might indicate this. Instead, the film generates a travelogue in its tone, as it displays how they will get from point A to point B with the least amount of casualties. There are some additional ideas that pop up, but these do not increase the suspense, or drama within the story.

The Cave presents a rather disappointing horror experience. It simply shows the audience what happens, and does not generate a thoroughly tense and apprehensive environment. There are some moments where the audience will jump, but these scenes do not build up a comprehensive frightening milieu. It merely feels as if the film tries to evoke suspense through the characters' quest for survival, but the characters do not seem important enough to gain the audience's support. Some of the positives within the film are the sounds and visuals, which show that they had some terrific knowledge on the set as the film looks and sounds amazing. The film even generates an internal desire to succeed, but overall feels rather uninteresting.",1134691200,16,3785,5.070626003210273

On the flip side, two people said they liked it . . . just not as passionately as those who hated it!",1127260800,,555,4.121495327102804
3961419,2,B002OEBRJ8,"I got out of the theater laughing. This movie was hilliarious when it didn't try to be. It was that bad.

STORY: People get stuck in a cave. They are being killed by monsters. Nothing really new there.

CGI EFFECTS: REALLY BAD! The monsters looked really fake, and when they attacked someone, the camera shook so fast I couldn't see what was going on. Nice.

ACTING: BAD! Really, its funny to hear them speak, because its just funny how bad the acting was.

SCENERY: Really nice. These people knew how to make some scenerey. Too bad they couldn't figure out how to make a good movie.

OVERALL: See this at your own risk. But, if you like laughing at the bad acting, waste your money and see this!",1126396800,,696,4.40625
3961420,3,B002OEBRJ8,"This is not an American produced stars and I was not familiar with any of the actors.  Cole Hauser played Jack, who should have been the star, but he was turned into a zombie-like semi-monster by contamination in The Cave.

The Cave was wuder a 13th Century church in the Caprathian Mountains, wherever that is.  It started with anothre group getting caught by the demons from Hell and they and the cave fell onto the church and cemetery.  Jack and his group were hired to do underwater exploration because they were professionals and had the equipment to stay submerged for twenty-four hours.  The cave dwellers were right out of Elizabeth Peters' novels about the Egyptian tombs with their treasure.

European legends have sad endings.  They called their base camp a mile below the surface and three miles inside, Kublai Khan.  There were enormous caverns and an explosion caused the tunnel to collapse which made the passage complete blocked.  Jack is infected with a parasite from the mole he tangled with.  The black spider was caught as a speciman.  A black spider was hiding under my pillow, but I did managed to grab it and dispose of it before I was bit.

Beneath the sea the scene reselbmes mosaid, movin' out of New Orleans.  They called it a fork in the road, and to take only whatyou need as they attempted to escape.  When they moved five miles in, they noticed that Jack was not normal.  The rapids at the surface resembled white water rafting without the canoes.  The had a fre fall over a tall waterfall and found a creature in the water like a giant eel which had long sharp teeth and claws.  Jack transforms into a mutant.

The monster is everywhere, absorbs Charlie who was the best climber who was lured into its trap.  The giant monster goes up in flames.  Now, Cathy and Jack are both infected; the contagion mutates the hosts when it enters the bloodstream through a cut and infects the nervous system.

Cathy puts doubts in Tylre's mind that Jack is no longer human.  He acts like a crazy professer.  It was your responsibility.  Jack becomes demented and possessed by something which looked like a demon out of Hell.  It looks like a giant bat plus gargoyle.  They find a glorious underground cavern with stalagitites and fire which is a lot like Nicholai's mosaic legends.  One by one they are consumed by the monster.  Everything's got a weakness.

The scary music sets the scene as Tyler and Cathy escape to the surface.  He tries CPR; then Jack reappears and Alex is taken by the predator which has an insatiable appetite.  They find land and air and beautiful scenery again.  What is the final sacrifice, we wonder, as Tyler and Kathy converse at a sidewalk cafe.

This was a horror film underwater.  There is no letup from the suspense and constant harrassment by the eels and prehistoric Hellish monsters.  It is an urban legend of the sea.",1126224000,,2873,4.655378486055777
8375969,1,B002OEBRJ8,I watched this thinking it was going to be like The Descent bc t it was awful. The camera work is so bad that when something exciting happens you cant actually see anything going on because its so shaky and all over the place. I turned it off half way through.,1528761600,,260,4.117647058823529

8375971,3,B002OEBRJ8,"A generous 3 stars.

Recognizable cast from a few years ago to TV stars of today. Decent idea. Decent effects. Basically, it was predator/alien underground, minus the magic. So, no magic and no unique or creative sci fi = meh.

Wish I had not paid $ for this rental; I had to watch it in 2 spurts because I was bored. Wish it had been free on Prime because I would not have finished it.  I feel bad saying this because you could tell how hard the cast and moviemakers tried to make it good.",1526515200,,490,4.136842105263158
