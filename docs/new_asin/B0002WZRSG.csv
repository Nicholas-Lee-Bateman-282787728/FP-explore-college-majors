2130993,5,B0002WZRSG,"Aqua Teen Hunger Force is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I am really excited that the new DVD is coming out in November.  This DVD contains some of the finest and funniest episodes Williams Street made in this show, in my opinion.  From how I have seen the first two DVD collections, I have no doubt that this one will be just as good, if not better.  I love the extras on the DVDs, especially the easter eggs, as well as the commentary (even though they basically comment about nothing and just have a random conversation during the entire episode).

I will definately be buying this the day it comes out.  Sorry Amazon, I have to have it right away, I am too impatient to wait and get it in the mail. ;-)",1094601600,7,717,4.204379562043796

2131052,5,B0002WZRSG,"I own all seasons. This show is really geared towards adults. Not children under I would say 15. There is violence, adult themes and situations. This season originally aired in 2004 on Cartoon Network late night block called ""Adult Swim"".

It is a very funny show, and especially if you enjoy stupid humor. There are 4 main characters. Master shake who is manipulative and a smartass. Fry lock who is the intelligent one of the group and the most ""level headed"". Meat Wad who is much like a child. Carl Brutananadilewski the next door neighbor who is a work at home pervert.

My favorite episode on this disc is Unremarkable Voyage. (episode 2) is where Fry Lock creates a computer chip that Meat Wad eats (there is never any food in the house) and the team must shrink him down with a shrink ray Fry Lock developed to get the chip back out. This episode, I think is one of the best ones ever done. The ending made me laugh so hard the first time I saw it, I fell out of bed.

The other episode that is very, very funny is on Season 1; Balloonenstein. (Episode 5, Season 1)

There is a bit of a 'soap opera' in the beginnings of the episodes; In the third season, Dr. Weird (Seasons 1 & 2) was dropped in favor of segments from the pilot episode of Spacecataz, an unaired spin-off created by Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro. Six episodes were planned for production, but Adult Swim felt that there was little, if anything, that could be made into five more episodes, since all of the characters were destroyed at the end of the pilot. These segments featured the Mooninites and Plutonians trading insults, gestures, and practical jokes. The full Spacecataz pilot is available as a special feature on the Volume Four DVD box-set.( Very funny stuff) The Mooninites appear to outsmart the Plutonians for much of the series including tagging the Plutonians' ship and reversing a prank that involved 50 million large pizzas.

The openings were dropped starting in the fourth season. With the exception of his picture being visible in Frylock's room, Dr. Weird did not appear again until Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters in 2007.

This show is the show that inspired many legal issues for the show and 2 employees; Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28; and Turner Broadcasting (Owner of Cartoon Network) in 2007 after the first Boston bombing and the LED boards all over in the big cities ( NYC, Boston, Atlanta, ect...)with images of the main characters as part of what was called the guerrilla marketing campaign.

2131062,5,B0002WZRSG,"Dear Amazon Shopper,

This season is perhaps the defining season of ATHF and is a prime example of unadulterated comedy.  The opening sequence of Grim Reaper Gutters is the most classic ATHF moment you will ever experience.  Revenge of the trees is also laden with dry and often unexpected humor that might even verge on satire if the show took itself seriously (e.g. when the trees use Carl's skin for post-it notes).  This season has episodes that aren't spectacular (Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary comes to mind), but the occasional hiccup is far outweighed by the mass of comedic delight this series has to offer.

Bottom line, if you like to laugh, look no further than ATHF Vol. 3 (until you're done with this season, then you should probably go buy more).",1342569600,,768,4.8320610687022905
2131063,3,B0002WZRSG,"I laughed all the way through Volume One of the Aqua Teens, and then the series fell flat on Volume Two, so I came roaring into Volume Three hoping to recapture that old magic and was not rewarded by this volume.  There are a lot of good jokes here, but overall the slump that began in Volume Two continues here.  The series even begins to recycle old monsters, albeit giving them some new and funny twists, and I found myself walking away from the monitor fairly often as this series played on my computer.  The humor in this volume struck me as bloodier than the first two season (though not by much, admittedly), and I found myself wincing more than laughing, which is a bad sign.  The recycling of monsters suggested the show's creators were having a hard time coming up with new material.  How hard can that be, when your shows are only 15 minutes each and there are only a couple dozen of them in production?  Some cartoon series run for years and include scores of episodes. Is it that hard to come up with new creatures?

All in all, this season disappointed.  Season Four returns to the big laughs, like Season One, and personally I'd view Season Two and Season Three as failures that are good for buying used but not new.",1326326400,,1231,4.44
2131064,5,B0002WZRSG,"While each season of ATHF has its gems and usually a couple of clunkers, this just may be my favorite season.

'The Clowning' may be my favorite episode ever, and 'Total Recarl' and 'The Last  One' are right up there as well. 'Revenge of the Trees', 'The Cloning', 'Broodwitch', 'The Cubing', and 'The Shaving' are also all very, very weird and wonderful.

Overall, the series has worn off a just bit for me from when I was first blown away by it's sheer dada-esque insanity, but the best episodes still transcend to inspired, sublime levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor, leaving you both laughing out loud and shaking your head at the audacity and bravery of the storytelling. When your starting premise is a giant talking shake, fries, and wad of meat living in suburban New Jersey, USA how wrong can you go? If you like strange, gonzo humor (Monty Python would be my generation's touchstone) and/or out-there adult animation, you owe it to yourself to give this a try -- and give it a couple of episodes to let your head get into what the creators are doing.",1299801600,,1065,4.624338624338624
2131065,5,B0002WZRSG,"i'm not going to pretend to be impartial. it's one of my favourite shows of all time which is strange for me because when this show is bad, it's very bad. but the moments of genius are plenty and they make it all worthwhile. if you haven't seen the show and are wondering if you'll like it ask yourself if you find non-sequitours funny. if yes then carry on to the counter with your new purchase. personally i think vols 1-3 are the best of aqua teen. in vols 2 & 3 in particular the writers introduced more of an edge to the programme which i really got off on but which they seemed to backtrack from (relatively) from vols 4 onwards. i felt a real jolt the first time i saw the snap endings of the one where frylock gets his own flat & broodwich. anyway, god bless you aqua teens.",1295395200,,782,4.151315789473684

2131075,5,B0002WZRSG,"The episodes collected in the third volume of Adult Swim's Aqua Teen Hunger Force on DVD only solidify the fact that this show gets better and better.  Containing some of the absolute best episodes of the series, it's easy to see why Aqua Teen Hunger Force is the most popular original series on Cartoon Network's latenight Adult Swim lineup.  Master Shake, Frylock, Meatwad, and their neighbor Carl get into so much otherworldly hijinks that may seem just stupid when you first hear them, but the jokes and jabs are delivered at a dead-pan, break neck speed that always made the show work as well as it does.  The Aqua Teens meet a couple of prank pulling, jock aliens (""Frat Aliens""), Carl's body gets destroyed, and rebuilt (""Total Recarl""), Shake eats a haunted sandwich (the hilarious ""Broodwich""), and the Teens get in over their heads with guitar god Zakk Wylde (who voices himself in ""Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary"").  The ebst episodes to come from the series so far are on this set's second disc, including ""The Last One"" as the Mooninites gather all the old Aqua Teen rogue gallery members to destroy their adversaries.  In ""The Clowning"", Carl gets a new wig with demonic properties (the ending of which is so absurd you'll have a heart attack laughing), and the classic ""The Shaving"", in which the guys learn of a monster named Willie Nelson living in their attic.  And boy does he love ""juice"".  All in all, the third volume of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is undoubtadly the best of the series, and even if you're not a hardcore fan of the series, you should consider picking this up regardless.",1173312000,2,1611,4.752688172043011

2131079,5,B0002WZRSG,"The Aqua Teen Hunger Force is back for their third season.  Meet fast food heroes Master Shake, Meatwad, and Frylock.  Who would have thought that such a lame premise could be so funny?  With Meatwad's innocent stupidity, Frylock's dry wit, and Shake's caustic contempt, the jokes just keep rolling in.  Completing the circle is next-door neighbor Carl, a disgusting, uneducated, sloppy fat, hairy, Jersey-speaking guy who wears a sleeveless tank top, sweats, and flip-flops.

New monsters in season three are Skeeter and D.P., the evil Broodwich (a sandwich), Turkatron, The Wisdom Cube, a floating mechanical clown head, and an onion-spider named Willie Nelson.

DISC ONE:

1) Frat Aliens - Frat-boy aliens Skeeter and D.P. (who's dad owns a dealership) are attracted by the security grid Carl put up around his pool, and wind out passing out on the ATHF's lawn. (Best line: ""Dude, she's like a moped, fun to ride until your friends see you."")

2) Total Recarl - Carl's body is destroyed in Frylock's air toilet so Frylock looks for ways to rebuild him.

3) Kidney Car - Shake wrecks Carl's car and Meatwad gets it from the organ charity instead of a kidney.

4) Revenge Of The Trees - Shake deep fries a cow and dumps the oil in the woods, so the trees get angry and take him to wood court.

5) The Cloning - Frylock clones the TV too many times.  Matter breaks down over time.

6) Broodwich - Shake falls through the yard digging for gold and finds a bunch of skulls and the 'Broodwich', a haunted sandwich.  The argument in the netherworld is hilarious, about how their wives hate their hobbies.  Turns out its just the sun-dried tomatoes that are haunted, which no one will eat.

7) The Dressing - Turkatron, the robot turkey from the year 9595, shows up for Thanksgiving to save the ancestor of Gobblox.

8) The [blank] - Frylock moves out because Shake is so filthy.  Meatwad, Carl, and Shake get swollen, pus filled eyes from playing with raw chicken and burning Styrofoam.

9) The Cloning - The Wisdom Cube shows up on the ATHF's lawn.  He has all the wisdom in the world, but only wants to play practical jokes.

DISC TWO:  (Note:  I found the Disc Two titles misleading, they look like they are only commentaries.  There *are* episodes on this disc, and they are some of the very best!)

1) The Last One - Ignignot and Err, the Mooninites, gather all the beasties together from all the past ATHF episodes to discuss getting rid of our fast food heroes.  There's Happy Time Harry, the Brownie Monsters, The Wisdom Cube, D.P. and Skeeter, Rabbot, the Master Shake Clone, Oog the Caveman, Rolulox, Travis the Super Spore, Randy The Astonishing, Mothmonsterman, Drippy the mould, the Cybernetic Ghost Of Christmas Past, and The Plutonians.  The plot is to kill the ATHF with the Screw Of Damnation (which Ignignot found behind the Armoire Of Despair).

2) The Clowning - Carl gets a wig, but the hair possesses a strain of galactic DNA from the Clownacillus organism.  He turns into a clown, and so does Meatwad when the hair touches him.

3) Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary - Shake hires Zack Wylde and Geddy Lee to create a new birthday song called Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary.  I costs him 1.4 million to produce the song, and makes Zack angry.

4) The Shaving - (My favorite episode of all!)  It's Halloween, and the ATHF discover there is an onion-spider monster named Willie Nelson living in their attic.  Shake has to show Willie how to be scary, when all Willie wants to do is hang out and drink juice.  But wait till you see the juice!

-- Extras include deleted scenes, commentaries, making-of segments, and script pages.

I completely cracked up at the Wisdom Cube's prank phone calls, the gathering of bad guys in The Last One, the clown head, and especially Willie Nelson.  Season Three picks up the beat on this zany cartoon, making up for a slightly flat Season Two.  If you like Family Guy, Futurama, South Park, or Invader Zim, them you should get a big kick out of ATHF (though they still should lose the annoying theme music).  Enjoy!",1152403200,3,4075,4.700564971751413
2131080,5,B0002WZRSG,this is the best Adult Swim has to offer and it is awsome. Better then Robot Chicken by a little bit but its still better. but it feels like a rip when the whole thing is only 150 min. and a show is just 11 min. still is the best out there.,1148860800,2,240,3.6346153846153846
2131081,5,B0002WZRSG,"This day in age, few things strike me as truly brilliant. Like, Holy FU*)@NG SH*% that is utter GENIUS. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is, without any question in my mind, body, or soul, the most brilliant show on television right now. In fact, I don't think there's a piece of television programming within the past decade that can match the audacity of the show; the only thing that can run along side it (and beat it, really) is 'The Simpsons' in its prime -- you know, I'm talking like, seasons 4-8, or somewhere around there. That level of excellence, I think, shall never be reached again, but if anything comes close, it's Aqua Teen Hunger Force in its later seasons -- namely three and four. This just so happens to be three, you lucky dog.

Sure, there's Family Guy. Hoopdy damn do. Hoopdy damn doodoo. Your moment. His movement. Yeah. Family Guy, which I was once a rabid fan of, is a good show. Used to be great, I think, but now is merely good. Macfarlene is a genius but the show got lazy. American Dad, sucker that it was, got in the way. Futurama was good, and got quite awesome, but its ambition sidetracked it a bit. Oh yeah, The Critic... That show, had it lasted, would have been downright mindboggling, but you know, the greatest are often stoned too early.

What's my point?  There is no point. This is divine stuff. Why? Everything comes together. Chaos transforms to order and as we witness this we are perplexed. By this season, the masters go deeper into their psyches and contemplate what is truly funny, and how in the world they could make the show better. Basically, we finally get a fine tuned program, which season two hinted at but never quite manged. Every single damn episode here is consistent. The animation, voice acting, editing, sound effects, timing... they're all spot on. It's not as quickly paced as the following season, but it's more coherent because of that.

The voice acting here cannot go unseen. Dave Willis, co-creator and vocalizer of main characters Meatwad and Carl, as well as a slew of the show's other guest characters, is a downright king among men. He's like Castellaneta at his peak with Homer Simpson, or MacFarlane in the most glorious moments of Stewie Griffin. Meatwad I believe is the show's most immediate force and attraction, and Carl ultimately becomes most fans' (that I know of) favorite. I can't get into technicality -- I'm not a voice coach -- but instinct doesn't lie to me... This guy is a bonafied prodigy. Same goes for Snyder as (Master) Shake. The guy has mastered his craft by this point. It's obvious he improvs a great deal of the time, and within each episode he simply comes more and more into his sphere of the Shake. Carey Means as Frylock showcases himself well too, and though his character isn't as pivitol regarding hysteria as the other three, he is indispensable and can still make you laugh until you s@#% yourself.

That's just the voice acting. The animation is to the common eye mediocre. To one of the higher intellect, however, it reveals its true colors. Minimilistic in the most wonderful sense. Case in point -- you often see nothing but Shake, unanimated, for seconds at a time, usually while another character verbally condemns him.  Nothing more. And yet, I want to cry because it's so unbelievably funny. I don't always know exactly WHAT the reasoning behind this is -- though I know there is in fact logic to it which I can usually identify to a point -- but it doesn't matter. It makes me  hurt from laughter. Yet another case in point -- normal, absurdist dialogue by Shake and Meatwad ensues, and Meatwad merely sits in the middle with his eyes going from one character to another. Like, three snippets of animation, over thirty seconds. Yet therein lie comedic gold. And this I know -- without getting into the psycho-specifics -- many of these moments cause such uproarious joy because of one thing -------- they hint at the core of the infinite ABSURDITY THAT THE WHOLE SHOW IS. It is surreal and the most whack thing you've ever seen, if you really tap into it, and within that beast of chaos is outrageous, stunning comedy.

I shouldn't write too much, as surely many fans of the show aren't looking for reviews of this nature, but I like to at least present a somewhat articulate response to the show. I actually forgot to name another show that comes close to this level of merit -- Upright Citizens Brigade. Like Aqua Teen, the show showcased absurdist humor like little else. The type of show that puts every other program on television to utter f*%@ng shame. It might be shallow, but when someone says one of their favorite shows is Friends, I immediately dismiss their entire character, because it is completely idiotic and Lifeless in the face of something so rigorously refined and crafted.

I don't like rating anything five stars. I just don't. I do it, but I usually think, ""meh -- does that really deserve it?"". Absolutely not an inch of doubt here with this DVD. Not an inch. I pirate things, occasionally. Download music a good amount. Never would I dare take a free copy of this DVD -- I've bought backup copies to lend to friends. This show can bring a lot of joy to someone's Life, and remind them of the most intimitely funny selves within them.

I owe these guys so much.",1148515200,11,5297,4.625531914893617

Volume three is one of the craziest and sickest. My favorite is Shakes rendition of the Happy Birthday song and the man-eating onion. This is some of the most original comedies you could ever see and it will have you laughing at every joke. Look some people don't like this and a lot do but this is something different and unique, who wants to keep on watching the same old boring stuff on TV and Adult Swim fulfills their fans with all the laughter they can handle in Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

The one for the frat aliens was by far the funniest part in the entire episode. The extras are good. I really liked the commercials from adult swim.

Overall, this is an amazing piece of bizarre wacked-out comedy.",1135728000,2,458,4.4523809523809526

*Total Recarl - Something horrible happens to Carl...but they have the technology, they can...rebuild him.

*Revenge of the Trees - Treat the earth right, or it just might seek....revenge!

*Frat Aliens - One of my favorites.  Do you know who his father is?!

*Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary - Shake has created a NEW birthday song, and plans to make a lot of profits out of this.  Do you know how many birthdays there are a day?  Hundreds.  Literally....hundreds.

*Kidney Car - Meatwad gets a car...yes, it is funny.

*The Cubing - space cubes...

*The Shaving - Little did the aqua teens know, they had another roommate..living in the attic!  great halloween episode.

*The Clowning - Carl and others are infected...and it is funny

*The Dressing - Thanksgiving time....

*THE - One of the funniest episodes

*The Cloning - Frylock's cloner is exploited...by shake.

Watch as Carl and Meatwad are turned into clowns by a freak bacteria strain while our heroes do absolutely nothing... for decades!  Yes, Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad redefine lazy in this volume of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

Out of all the volumes, I'd say that this one has the fewest truly great episodes, but I also think that the good ones on here are some of the funniest that I've ever seen.  Total ReCarl is one of my favorites.  It involves Carl being decapitated by a super toilet built by Frylock.  The Aqua Teens decide to rebuild him, with some hilarious results.  We also meet Willy Nelson this year.  Not the singer, but a spider/onion monster that lives in the attic of the Aqua Teens, who, according to Shake, is the gayest monster to ever be gay.  In another hilarious episode, Shake finds a demonic sandwich known as the broodwich (the Blair Witch!?).  It is the tastiest sandwich ever created, but a cruel fate is in store for anyone who eats it.  Also, the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past fromt the Future returns in a new form.  At Thanksgiving, he shows up sporting his new, sleek turkey body, and attempts to save the life of the turkey that the Aqua Teens are about to eat for dinner.  In The Cloning, we learn that Frylock has been cloning TVs, and after cloning the same one so many times, weird things start to occur.  Then there's The Clowning, with Carl and Meatwad turning into clowns, and Revenge of the Trees, which has Shake and Carl being put on trial by some trees for dumping cooking oil in the forest.  Finally, there's The Last One (which isn't the last episode of the series), in which most of the series' villains return to attend a conference held by the Mooninites Inignokt and Err.

2131091,4,B0002WZRSG,"About the previous two collections of ATHF episodes I said the following:

Watching an episode (all under 12 min) of Aqua Teen Hunger Force is comparable to hours of meditation. There are few shows that will clear your mind and cheer you up this well. However the show is not well appreciated by those who attempt to understand it. Out of all the episodes I have seen over the years, I recall only one where the plot actually achieved resolution. Additionally, the program might not be enjoyed by some because a certain level of understanding and amusement for the eccentricities of Bridge and Tunnel Trash (residents of New Jersey) is required.

The relationships and interactions of the main characters and their neighbor provide a wonderful barometer against which to measure your own friendships.

All told its wonderful programing.

That is all still true, but the reviewers who hint at the waning quality of the episodes are correct...to some extent, the writers period of faltering is evident here, but the episodes that follow this collection show less of the 'faltering' exemplified here.",1109548800,8,1097,5.044198895027624

Plus less episodes and some lame attempt at filler by including scripts and other non essentials. This is definitely a must for fans and I won't give up my copy, but it is the weak one of the three and I'm a little steamed that I payed full price for it.",1106611200,6,636,4.204918032786885

2131096,4,B0002WZRSG,"One of my friends used the above quote to describe the experience of watching this show, and I wholeheartedly concur.

Sweet Jebus, I don't think a more Dadaist, random, absurd bit of programming exists on network TV. You've got man-sized talking fast food products living in a run-down surburbia--a self-aggrandizing and inept milkshake, a basket of fries with genius IQ, and an insanely cute and mildly retarded lump of hamburger meat. A trashy gold chain-wearing Jerseyite who just wants the above trio to leave him the hell alone. A pair of pixelated Atari game rejects with perpetual middle fingers, and assorted space aliens/monsters/robots of all shapes and sizes. And that is only the tip of the iceburg. It actually gets tons stranger from there. It's just... GAH.

There's seriously NOTHING in the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim roster that resembles this. Sealab 2021 and Space Ghost Coast To Coast occasionally approach this level of bent humor, but with more of a satirical angle. With its combo of absurd one-liners, pop-culture jokes, black humor, bathroom gags, bad taste tempered by pure loopiness, and plain all-out disturbing imagery, Aqua Teen stands alone.

Words cannot do this sort of thing justice. Definitely an acquired taste. If your tastes are ""normal"" in any way, shape, or form, you WILL run away screaming on first viewing. Only a truly warped mind will get mileage out of this postmodern insanity. By far the best and most consistent Season, #3 features the most brilliant installments ever--""The Broodwich,"" ""The Cloning,"" ""Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary,"" and ESPECIALLY ""The Shaving."" Hilariously disturbing, or disturbingly hilarious? You decide. Keep a sponge nearby while watching this show--it'll be useful for cleaning the gray matter off your walls.",1105056000,14,1792,5.3250883392226145

Volume 1 was really good, but they tried too hard to stick to a plot and it have very little special features.

Well, Volume 3 is loaded with special features, including a sneak peak at how they wrote ""The Cloning.""  Very interesting stuff.  It also includes my favorite episode ""The Broodwich,"" and a very long, yet funny, deleted scene from it (It's good that it was deleted though).

2131098,5,B0002WZRSG,"my friends and i like to refer to the various volumes of aqua teen hunger force based on what drugs we can best guess matt and dave were doing while they were writing.  obviously a lot of pot was being smoked during the first season.  following the success of episodes such as ""mayhem of the mooninites"" and ""mc pee pants"" they were most likely able to afford some seriously dank herb and as such, the volume 2 episodes were born.  some bad acid seems to be the only explanation for the bizarre brand of mind-f*ck they've come up with this time around.  when these episodes originally aired on adult swim i remember picking up a really dark vibe from a few of them.  some of the episodes in this set border on disturbing (""broodwich,"" ""the shaving,"" and some parts of ""the cloning""); but of course it's all injected with the sort of warped humor dave and matt have become famous for.  though lacking the wackiness of volume 1 and the depth of writing present in volume 2,  volume 3 marches forward with a newfound dose of black humor and a powerful sense of a shift in direction.",1104537600,4,1079,4.446700507614213

2131107,5,B0002WZRSG,"The new Volume Three box of ATHF is even more insane than the first three seasons of the show.  For rabid fans of the show, and of the Adult Swim programming block on Cartoon Network in general, it's an obvious must-have.

For those out there who still wonder what the fuss is all about, I'll try to explain.  While some of the other ""adult"" animation series make a pretense of pushing the envelope of taste, content, and creativity, the brilliant minds behind ATHF, like The Braak Show and Space Ghost before it (thank God for the Turner Animation group and the Williams Street Studio crew), just simply toss the envelope out the window.  Focused stream-of-conciousness--with abandoned pop-culture and animation leftovers as a prop shop--this is the stage that ATHF occupies.  As another reviewer remarked sometime back, imagine if Samuel Beckett wrote and produced a Saturday morning cartoon show for adults, using an assemblage of kiddie-tune cliches from the 60s to the 90s.  What you get is absurdism that invents its own world and makes sense, all the while being outrageously funny.  ATHF is THAT good.  The writing is amazingly consistent, and continues to push itself farther and farther out.

In an odd way, it kind of reminds me of Paul Henning's old ""Green Acres"" sitcom from the 60s, which was dismissed at the time as being a stupid rural comedy.  Think in terms of Henning's crew of writers being a couple of generations younger, with THAT much more cultural detritus to mold and destroy.  As a stage and plot device, replace the former's country surrealism with the idea of lifesize milkshake--""Master Shake""--with delusions of grandeur, living with an equally large and scientifically brilliant box of french fries--""Frylock"", as well as a mentally challenged wad of hamburger named Meatwad.  Place these three in a run-down rental home in New Jersey, with a gnarly, sexually obsessed dirtball named Carl as a neighbor, and have the whole ensemble routinely terrorized by incompetent aliens and demons of various shapes, sizes, and origins.  With that as your launching pad, just let it all rip.
