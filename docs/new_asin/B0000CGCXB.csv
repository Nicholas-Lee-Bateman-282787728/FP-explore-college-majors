BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S won Hank Mancini a pair of music Oscars. Audrey Hepburn also was nominated for Best Actress.

There's many legends (some verifiable) surrounding this classic drama:
1.) Truman Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play call girl Holly, but she thought the role would be bad for her image.
2.) Jean Seberg and Kim Novak were considered for Holly before the film's producers decided on Miss Hepburn.
3.) Steve McQueen was offered George Peppard's part but was unavailable.
4.) The film doesn't follow Truman Copote's story.
5.) It DOES follow his story.
6.) 19-year-old Holly likes herb, has a dirty mouth, once terminated a pregnancy and dates both men and women.
7.) Her brother Fred also isn't ""straight.""

And so on.

Sight aione verifies the obvious:
Hepburn's rare beauty is ideally enhanced by an exquisitely accessorized black sheath dress. Mr. Peppard is equally as pulchritudinous and they make a gorgeous couple. Their bittersweet rainy alleyway scene at story's end is one of the most emotional moments in cinematic history.

Mickey Rooney is highly annoying (and incredibly un-P.C.) in his comic relief role as a mule-toothed, Coke bottle eyeglass-wearing Oriental. Buddy Ebsen defines acting perfection as Holly's abandoned husband, come from the country to NYC to bring his ""Lullamae"" home.

Blake Edwards' early masterpiece is a complex tale of a mercurial young lady who freely accepts cash gifts from men, is most at ease in overcrowded, swinging cocktail parties, and at her neurotic worst when alone with the one man she's attracted to, a handsome young author of a single book who struggles to write anything new. Theirs is a beautiful love story with tragic overtones that's one of this reviewer's all-time favorite movies. Highest recommendation!
