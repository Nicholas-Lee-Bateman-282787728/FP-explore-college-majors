7885681,2,6305199450,"Be aware that these five films were made in Jackie's early career, when he had low budgets and little creative control.
This DVD set is recommended only for the die-hard Jackie Chan fan, to complete one's collection.  He is in his top athletic ability in his youth, though.  So the action scenes are interesting to watch.
Here are my comments, with IMDB ratings:
Half A Loaf Of Kung Fu (5.8/10) painfully bad silly comedy.
To Kill With Intrigue (4.8/10) formulaic revenge plot.
The Killer Meteors (4.4/10) Jackie is the villain!
New Fist Of Fury (5.5/10) a remake of Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" / ""The Chinese Connection.""
Spiritual Kung Fu (5.7/10) actually kind of humorous.",1006646400,4,675,4.860869565217391

Also, the  movies are subtitled, but because of bad translation, you can't see the  english subtitles most of the time, only the top half of the mandarin.  however, keep in mind that the movies themselves are good, and well worth  20 individually(provided that they're not recorded like this).",957484800,,569,4.947368421052632
