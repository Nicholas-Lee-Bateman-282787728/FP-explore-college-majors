5676605,4,B00BUWD7UW,"PROS.... A good amount of unseen photos and usually unseen segments of famous speeches (*unseen meaning ""I"" haven't seen them in any previous docs I have seen and I have seen quite a few, but not all). Good overview of the administration.
CONS....too few interviewee's (only 3 in whole series) and those that are did have a remote connection to firsthand knowledge of the events... not the most dynamic or engaging doc on this subject... not too fussy about the narrator....very little pre-presidential coverage...reuses same stills/footage throughout series. Not crazy about the actual title of the series itself.
If you have seen many previous Kennedy docs then this might be a disappointment. If you have little knowledge of the Kennedy administration then it is informative. If you are going to have only one or very few Kennedy docs in your possession, there are better ones out there to pick from.
*The bonus disc is worth the price of purchase: it contains:
- a vintage B&W Secret Service sponsered newsreel about the ""facts"" of the assassination with amazing footage of Dealy Plaza and the school book depository shortly after the events.
- B&W Nixon/Kennedy debate
- a (30 min approx) colour coverage of the entire funeral event in Washington.
- lastly there is a John Ford 1971 ""Produced"" doc on Vietnam which is a very bias pro-intervention view of the events  with Chuck Heston narrating, but still is an interesting time capsule of the time period and the struggle to make sense of a sense-less conflict which at that point was still raging.

5676607,5,B00BUWD7UW,"I lived this part of history and as I sit watching the several disks, talk out loud and say, ""Oh, I remember that"" and I even remember where I was when it happened, such as the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald, supposedly the lone assassin of JFK. If you enjoy history, as I do, or if you lived in the 1950's and 1960's, I think you'll become as absorbed in the subject matter as I was and am. Great documentary.",1423267200,2,414,4.1875

5676615,3,B00BUWD7UW,I was so looking forward to watching this - I gave up after half an hour - the narrator sounds like a poor school teacher - things repeated - stories promised not arrived at - and there are 8 episodes oh dear - I hope when I get the courage to go back - the series picks up and proves its promise of a good programme,1389052800,,316,3.803030303030303
5676616,2,B00BUWD7UW,"I, like so many others, am fascinated by the JFK assassination. Since 2013 marked the 50th anniversary of the assassination, a slew of DVDs flooded the market about this subject. Some were great and did shed a tiny bit of new light on this well documented event while most were lackluster and created solely to cash in on the renewed interest (much like the anniversary of Marilyn Monroe's death in 2012). This disc by Mill Creek falls into the lackluster/cash in category.

I think the biggest draw for this film is the price. I've seen the DVD at stores for $5 and I grabbed this Blu-Ray for a mere $9 at Target. Like all Mill Creek productions, the price is almost always low which is why I own far too many Mill Creek DVDs. By the time I remember that this studio puts out some of the most boring documentaries known to man, I've already bought another of their releases (admittedly, I didn't even look to see who produced this such was my zeal). I think the hearts of the good folks at Mill Creek are in the right place, but they simply cannot produce a documentary about any subject without boring me to tears. The narrator of almost all of their documentaries has the most uninteresting, flat voice. It reminds me of the voices of narrators in the narcotically boring film strips we were forced to watch in school. Even if you're interested in the subject, it takes all your strength not to fall asleep or, at the very least, zone out. It's a shame too because Mill Creek does produce documentaries on subjects that are pretty interesting (the Mob and Vegas, serial killers, WWII, Hitler and the Titanic) but they bungle them each and every time.

As others have stated, there are some good points. This documentary features some rare(ish) photos and the special features (available on the Blu-Ray only) are interesting (Much more than the documentary. Go figure!) but the interviewees drone on and on. If you're a JFK collector, this might be a nice addition to your collection just for obsessive completeness' sake but I doubt it will be a flick you reach for very often. If you're only marginally interested in the subject, skip it. I know the low price is a tempting but don't be fooled. This is like warm milk spiked with Ambien in disc form.",1388707200,3,2254,4.590570719602978

5676619,5,B00BUWD7UW,There is so much on JFK - A New World Order - Commemorative Documentary Series that is so very wonderful.  Take an evening to watch this because it is long so get your snacks readyand if you are like meyour tissues too.  I love watching President Kennedy but I hate the assassination!  That is when the tissues come outyou will totally enjoy all of this until you get to his murder.  His funeral is something to see because Jackie really did it!!!  I still remember it from my memory and this just reenforced what I remember.  If you love President Kennedyget it and enjoy it because it is the history of our country as sad as it is!!!!,1385942400,2,636,4.3474576271186445
5676620,5,B00BUWD7UW,"Fifty years ago, on November 22, 1963, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK) was assassinated, ending the dreams of a nation, and giving birth to the myth, as well as a given number of so-called conspiracy theories. Everyone has an idea of the man and what he meant, but sometimes we need help. JFK  A New World Order is a well-done, engaging, and informative documentary  unbiased, I think --, which gives anybody an idea of what JFK accomplished in his two years and ten months in office.

The documentary is presented in eight parts, in which we take a guided tour through JFKs life in a chronological manner, beginning with Early years, where we learn about his early years in Massachusetts, and how his father (the infamous Joseph Kennedy) helped him, and kind of pushed him toward a career in politics. He became the first Irish American mayor of Boston, went to Harvard, wrote his book Why England slept, served in the army, won a seat in the House of Representatives, won a Pulitzer Prize for his book Profiles in Courage, and more. For All to see, the second part, shows JFKs run for the presidency against Richard Nixon, fights between democrats about JFK (he is too young, he is catholic, his father buys votes, not liberal enough, etc), and the 1960 election. The third part, New Frontiers, takes us to January 20, 1961, when JFK delivered one of his best speeches, creates the Peace Corps, his enthusiasm for the space race, the challenge of communism, etc. The following parts cover the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the nuclear scare, his civil rights record, Martin Luther King, and much more, culminating with Camelot and Beyond, where JFKs health problems, family Life, assassination, and legacy are examined.

As mentioned earlier, JFK  A New World Order is a good way to get an introduction to JFK, in a non-manipulative way  at least, I repeat, as I see it. The Blu-ray & DVD combo also features some extras, such as the Kennedy Vs Nixon debate, Assassination of JFK, Funeral service for President JFK, and Vietnam! Vietnam! (by John Ford). (USA, 2013, color & B&W, 6 hrs 35 min plus additional materials)

5676622,4,B00BUWD7UW,"When I think of this title , when John Kennedy first started out as President , it was hardly a new world order...he went through the Bay of Pigs CIA plan ; there was a cold war that almost led to nuclear war over Cuba...but  by 1963 John Kennedy was starting to come out of that ""World War II "" mentality and begin a quest for world peace starting with his American University address...still , you see things here that kind of gives a real view beyond his myth....his actions during the civil rights movements and Vietnam....you see a strange dichotomy that is his true record ; what he would have done had he lived after Dallas is like throwing darts into a fog...the only reason I give this four stars is the manner in the way the assassination is done....it's your atypical "" Oswald did it alone ""...he was.. guilty...the man never saw a trial and was killed in a Dallas jail transfer by a person who had Mafia connections on national television live...makes you wonder ,does it not ?...",1377129600,2,992,4.480662983425415
5676623,2,B00BUWD7UW,"I was quite disappointed by JFK-A New World Order. In short, there was nothing in this DVD has hasn't been included in so many other programs about JFK, and most of the commentary was provided by some historian that I've never heard of, not that he didn't have some interesting things to say. The footage used was ok, but not great, and far clearer versions of the footage are found on other DVDs and TV programs. Good have been much better.",1376265600,4,441,4.45679012345679

The main body of the Blu-ray was very disappointing - utilizing very poor period video and lacklustre commentary. A very poor effort.",1371600000,6,377,5.19672131147541
5676626,3,B00BUWD7UW,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 8 segments (27 minutes each for a total of 215 minutes) of JFK's private and political life.  However, the info on the Amazon website stated that the length of this dvd was 583 minutes, which, I discovered later, turned out to be incorrect, as it contained only 215 minutes, meaning that 368 minutes were missing! I contacted Amazon & explained this & was able to return my dvd & was not charged for it.(Thank you, Amazon!) I will reorder the combination dvd/blue ray which DOES include the missing minutes. The extra info that totals up to 583 minutes is described ONLY on the dvd/blue ray site. When I ordered the dvd version, none of this info was there, which led me to assume that the 8 segments themselves would total 583 minutes. This info needs very much to be corrected! For anyone interested in seeing all 583 minutes, order the dvd/blue ray combination. The dvd does not have even half the minutes of the blue ray version. I'm so disappointed that dvds are now not including many or any extras on their discs. We have to buy the blue ray version (higher priced, of course) to get this.",1370736000,30,1121,4.5495049504950495

8574252,5,B00BUWD7UW,"Pleasant surprise, excellent use of archival footage. Many of the photos and news footage have stories on their own merits. Sen. Charles Goodell of NY, father of the NFL commissioner, the photo of JFK signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The commentaries added perspective. While JFK had Hollywood film stars tutoring him on presentation, Nixon did too. A silent film actress who was a California national committee woman had helped with the Checkers speech. Nixon never was an apt pupil with TV.
Would be a nice resource for a history class.",1492732800,,542,4.967032967032967

8574254,1,B00BUWD7UW,"JFK A New World Order is a documentary following the facts of the JFK presidency with commentary that borders offensive. The ""Historian"", tim rosenfield, intentionally or unintentionally represents history falsely. JFK is presented as a bumbling president who stumbled into office and took things as they came. As the truth is JFK was a calculating politician. Watch it for yourselves and you'll see where these facts of history are twisted to fit someones point of view as opposed to facts of history. It winds up to be a pretty funny documentary when you see through the obvious twisting of JFK motives. No stars, ok 1 star.",1453075200,,626,4.915094339622642
