8593086,2,B00DH34FSA,"A strange hybrid, half fast talking wise cracking ""comedy,"" half behind the scenes of reporters scooping each other, all sour. None of the jokes land, and there's no mystery to the mystery- except why a normal girl like Bette Davis' character would spend anytime with her psycho love interest.  I can't imagine this played well at any time.  Skip it, there's too many better films to watch.",1490918400,,390,4.8059701492537314

The Story: Two rival reporters in love with one another work out their snuggles as they outscoop each other in the game of yellow journalism.
~
Bette Davis again plays a woman with a job. So the question you have to ask is: do you believe that she actually could do that job?
Bette Davis' characters often had jobs: a waitress, a whore, a school marm, a private secretary, a nanny, an actress: the one she is to be set against in this matter is Katharine Hepburn. To clearly illustrate the point, you might first set her against Elizabeth Taylor, who never played characters who had jobs, because, of course, she is too beautiful to lift a finger and, for goodness sakes, nobody would want her to. But Hepburn, who came from the same middleclass New England background as Davis, although one more financially stable, would also seldom play women who had jobs.

If you look at Hepburn's working characters, you find that she can play an aspiring actress, because that's what she always was, but that she is ridiculous in The Rainmaker, not merely because she is too old and too lachrymose, but because she is not someone who would ever haul manure. Nor does she wash as a schoolteacher: Summertime and The Corn Is Green, because she is not the sort of person would have taken any interest in the minds of the young, is she?  Hepburn can play upper class women in all kinds of movies, and she could play daredevils beautifully, and at high comedy she is unsurpassed. She is a different kind of actress entirely from Davis in that Hepburn's bent, as Kazan said of her, is to play heroines of noble intent.

This is a kind of character now not much in favor among female actors, although still a type that male actors will bid to play, as Gary Cooper in his day did, for Cooper had written into his contract that he did not play characters who died. Davis is not that sort of actor at all. She can die whenever she wants: Beyond The Forest, Dark Victory, Of Human Bondage, The Letter. Hepburn can do many things admirably, and we love her for them, but one thing she didn't do is die.

But she also once played a reporter; it wasn't the sort of reporter Davis plays here, but a high class international columnist Tess Harding in Woman Of The Year, and one believes entirely in Hepburn's ability to be that and do that, I think, as does one also believe in Rosalind Russell's ability to be a reporter in His Gal Friday; in which case, the reporter is very much along the lines of Davis character before us here. Unlike Hepburn, Davis' work would not appear in the New York Time or anything of similar elevation in the day of many newspapers indeed.

Did Katharine Hepburn ever faint on screen? Hepburn had a strong athletic constitution. She wasn't given to vapors. Good for her. Did Davis faint on screen? You wouldn't think so, but here she does it for us, falling down convincingly when confronted with the execution of a woman for murder.

But it's an odd bit of work Davis is called upon to do, and what makes it odd is the costumes Davis wears for the role, which at one point include fox furs with all the heads luffing as she walks. So it looks like, although the script does not say so, that she is a college girl from a good family, with a drive to be a front-page crime reporter. This is quite convincing, and the exposition does not disconfirm it.

She plays in the high-key, snappy dialogue style of the day, and she is very good at it. You wonder how actors of those days ever got those lines out so fast. Pat O'Brien and James Cagney and Carole Lombard and Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant were wisecrack experts, and Davis and George Brent are right up there with them. Hollywood-crisp is the style writ quick. Nor air between the lines or in the lines either. To do it, you act on the lines; that is to say, both your response to what has been said to you and what you are going to answer to it all takes place in a split second as you speak. As in life, you figure out what the person opposite you is going to say before they are finished saying it. Nothing is mulled.

So the thing to watch for here, with Davis, is how she adjusts herself to play the fast pitch of such a part. You've got to be very sure of your lines. You've got to be ahead of the riposte. And she is. And she also pitches her voice a little higher, because the lower register slows down the velocity. Lauren Bacall.

George Brent plays the ace reporter of a rival paper, but reporters jobs are shown as living from scoop to scoop, and he and Davis race around town to get ahead of one another on an unsolved murder. David Thomson, with some justification, remarks that Brent couldn't be a daily reporter - he's a weekly columnist - but at the snappy dialogue trick he's easily as good as Davis.

George Brent is derided these days as being wooden. And there is some truth to that, for from his double chin down, he is so. He has no flexibility in his neck, his shoulders are hunched, he doesn't have a paunch but he looks as though he does, so he doesn't look great in the beautiful clothes he wears. He's not but he appears something of a penguin. He always looks too stuffy for her lively youth. For George Brent had learned the secret of eternal middle-age.

But two important things operate in his favor. One is that his fundamental screen energy is steady, for Davis's fundamental screen energy is volatile. He gives her and she gives him the necessary generic human quality to play off of.

But given his steadiness, he is affable, fun, sweet, a good kisser, inwardly humorous, and fully up to competing with Davis, to dominating Davis, indeed to topping her in her ability to outtalk any man in the territory. His eyes are full of the spark of mischief. He is very playable as an actor. Indeed, in this film he has the longer part.

Tony Gaudio, the top photographer at Warners, filmed it, and Michael Curtiz directed it, as, in the same style he would direct ""Jimmy, The Gent"" with Davis and Cagney. Curtiz gives a clip to this sort of story, and in it you'll notice, nobody strolls. The story is well paced, and we don't really care who killed who, but only whether the women's lib of the era would allow George Brent to admit to Bette Davis that a woman could be as good a reporter as a man, on which allowance she will allow them to become engaged. He does, they do.

Davis a pretty as a blond, lively, attractive, full of fun, and, like so many actresses of her era, game.

8593091,5,B00DH34FSA,"I was so excited when this DVD was released. Though I never saw it, I truly do love Bette Davis and George Brent together. this film was fun and enjoyable. Have to love competition in the work force LOL",1387065600,5,202,4.205128205128205
8593092,4,B00DH34FSA,"It's unusual to find a 1930's mystery in such good shape. I played it on my blu-ray/small screen and it looked brand new. Bette Davis plays herself - and since I never liked her much, this was a stretch for me. George Brent plays a 1930's male - 'a woman's place is in the home' and Davis is out to prove him wrong, which was probably a new plot twist to the original audience but is 'old hat' to the millenium crowd. Myrna Loy and William Powell would have done a better job keeping it light and fun and would have had a ton better chemistry as romantic partners. I found Brent's 'pranks' a bit too cruel to be funny. Michael Curtiz directs and you can see some of his usual directing techniques, which I find to be a plus. It is better cast and directed and much better looking than the average 'B' movie, so I gave it a four. Worth a look.",1385856000,3,842,4.140243902439025
8593093,3,B00DH34FSA,"By 1935, Bette Davis was beginning to establish herself in Hollywood. ""Of Human Bondage,"" the film which really made the audience and critics take notice, was behind her. While she was mainly relegated still to low budget programmers, her confidence had grown. ""Front Page Woman"" is one of the best of these ""apprentice"" films. Davis plays a reporter competing with her boyfriend, George Brent, also a reporter but working for an opposing paper. While the plot of the film is centred on a murder and court case and credibilty is ignored as these reporters keep one step ahead of the investigating police, the trivialities and improbability are secondary to the banter - a battle of the sexes, 1935 style. Davis always played well with Brent whose cheeky approach to comedy is a delight. There are some great lines for both stars and particularly for Roscoe Karns as Brent's photographer. Michael Curtiz directed the film and keeps the pace up. This is a very entertaining romp.

The DVD has been released in the Warner's Archive series which means it is unrestored, expensive and with no extras. In this case,the theatrical trailer is included and it is a gem because Brent and Davis play themselves. The print of the film is only adequate.",1375056000,10,1240,4.876777251184834
