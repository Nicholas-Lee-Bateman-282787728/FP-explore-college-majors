Tommy lets go of his balloon and wanders around the stadium to find it.  Will Stu and Grandpa find Tommy? In ""Rebel Without a Teddy Bear""  (which should be called ""Rebel Without a Lion""), Didi throws  Henry, Tommy's stuffed lion away. Angelica tells Tommy that if he acts like  a rotten brat, he'll get Henry back. Will he? in ""Case of the Missing  Rugrat"", Tommy gets driven to a palace. Will Grandpa Lou find Tommy at  the palace that he's at? Well, that's all the shows. Enjoy!",917827200,6,607,4.375
