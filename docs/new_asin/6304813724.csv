7878325,1,6304813724,"perhaps because of the cover of the disc that entranced me being the visible shot of the Twin Towers that lured me into the purchase that gave me enticement for purchase, but sadly the movie was probably filmed in canada for the distinct lack of any New York shown in All of it! The plot was something awful too!",1481846400,,312,4.305084745762712
7878326,5,6304813724,"if i was anyone else in the world, i would think this movie is horrible. but this movie was very relevant to my life at one point.

first off, i look exactly like Redmond its scary, ive seen Kevin Corigann recently and he looks alot diffrent, hes put on some weight and grew facial hair. but the resemblence with me and Redmonds character is almost 100%, and at the time i saw the movie i was in love with a woman who was a stewardess. she was a total b*tch like the character in the movie, and the relationship didn't work out in the end. but this movie fortold my life in a sense. really trippy.

but overall a heartfelt stupid funny cute movie. i recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humor",1145836800,,698,4.162962962962963
7878327,3,6304813724,"I liked it. woods was wacky as Corrigans uncle and it was funny to see Woods get hit y that bus at the end, hilarious. Michael Rapaport is absolutely awesome in this too. funny part is when Corrigans in Rapaports place with his girlfriend and his girlfriend is telling about how she raided some place that had a bunch of vibrators",1066089600,,330,4.426229508196721
7878328,5,6304813724,"Filmed in the lower east side of new york, the story tackles complex emotions and the struggling life of a writer.  It has a great cast with Michael Rappaport's best performance doing what he does best: acting like a beefy thug.  I'm not sure why Matthew Harrison never made more movies.",983404800,12,287,4.607843137254902
7878329,2,6304813724,"It wasn't all that bad, but then again it wasn't too good either. James Woods wasn't in that much of it but still made up some of the best parts. The funniest parts are still with the ""beer wars"". But in short, you can watch it, but don't buy it.",974937600,3,246,3.94
7878330,5,6304813724,"Very funny film about the exploits of Redmond and his group of roundabout cohorts. Accomplishes its purpose gracefully and hilariously. This is one  film that will capture the heart and senses with such originality and grace  that you'll applaud in your living room. Rent this gem where ever you can  find it. It often plays on Cinemax, so watch it the next time it plays.",941155200,2,372,4.6923076923076925
