It is the ideal birth.

As a midwife of home births Monique appears free from the fears that many of us have grown up with (about childbirth) and is able to use breathing and calming techniques to their maximum benefit.  The first birth appears nearly pain free and shows the tricks Monique uses to deal with the epic hours of waiting (such as the move-the-baby-down dance), while the second birth is so peaceful it is reminiscent of watching a cat have kittens (no disrespect to Ms. Gauthier!)  I find viewing this video an effective way to replace those Hollywood images of nightmare births.

Gauthier's commentary is to the point, with midwifery tips and preparation recommendations.

This is a birthing video to calm the nerves of any new mothers/ couples entering their first birth, showing childbirth as nature intended. In my work as an osteopath, I recommend this video to all my expecting patients and keep a copy in my treatment room.",1306713600,,1338,5.801020408163265
8436867,5,B004NY04LO,"I felt my shoulders drop within minutes of starting this DVD. Throughout watching the clips I felt my body relaxing and my mind and heart opening more to the incredible possibilities surrounding birth.

Early on in our pregnancy (our first) a friend advised us to see as many births as possible. I'm so glad to have received this advice and I'm so grateful that videos like this are available.

This is real footage (and optional commentary) of a midwife giving birth to her first and second born. Both of these births are well... really peaceful. Both births seem so gentle, so loving. I feel even more love for my wife after watching this DVD. I'm so excited to meet my son or daughter in a few months!

I thought it could be helpful to know exactly what's in the video:
Monique's Intro - 5min 54sec
Simone's Birth - 12min 28sec - with optional commentary
Pema's Birth - 15min 8sec - with optional commentary",1301097600,,910,4.570552147239264
8436868,5,B004NY04LO,"Monique's 'Birthing Peace' DVD is such a wonderful film as it is so un-glamourised and honest. As soon as I discovered that I was expecting a child, I immediately knew that I wanted to birth at home, preferably in the water. When I discovered this film, it really helped me to believe that I too could have a natural home birth without stress, fear or medical pain relief. In response to Monique suggested reading list, I read up on many sources about natural, home and water births, and this DVD helped me to get a glimpse into what the actual reality could be like. Monique's gentle approach to birthing is a true inspiration and with her example, I was able to have the confidence to birth at home without any pain relief in the birthing pool. I would recommend this DVD to all of my friends and family. Thank you Monique!",1297987200,,825,4.470198675496689
