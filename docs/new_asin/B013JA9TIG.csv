7366172,4,B013JA9TIG,"As a fan of the horror genre, I found this movie to be very creative and well written.  The writers definitely did their homework on the background of Krampus.  I liked that their were a few stories involved in this movie but all came down to the final twist.  There was an ""Oh, wow."" moment in the end and it all came together.  The only part that could have been left out was the scene with the child groping his mother, which was completely inappropriate.  I get that the child was ""no longer"" a child per se but that part was just down right perverse.  I couldn't imagine a parent even letting their child do that scene and feel comfortable so I'm a bit surprised it was actually in the film.  Other than that one scene, it was good movie. Just my opinion. The movie would not have been hurt by not using that scene.",1444521600,37,820,4.251612903225807
7366173,2,B013JA9TIG,"ok, I went in expecting this movie to be good, and to highlight whom I thought the main horror villain of this movie would be ""KRAMPUS"" but boy was I wrong. He doesn't make a full appearance until 1 hr and 5 minutes into the movie and then after that makes a couple of other brief appearances. I have to say that this movie is a mess, the editing was horrible, the story could of been waaay better but it jump from one storyline into another then back to a different storyline and then back to the previous storyline and on  and on and so forth, then after an agonizing wait for the movie to finally be over, they hit you up with a mild twist then the movie is over, ok so you think is over, then they hit you up with another twist then its over, and I could go on but as you can see by all my blabbering that this movie is a mess, and makes no sense at times. save your money. I was beyond disappointed",1444521600,5,903,3.9889502762430937

7366175,2,B013JA9TIG,"Best thing about this movie is Bill Shatner as DJ Dan philosophizing about Christmas as a loose tie-in to the 4 stories. Like TRICK R TREAT, these 4 stories cut from scene-to-scene-to-scene-to-scene, instead of being told straight forward and outright, and it hurts the narrative. Some of the stories are bland, others overlong. The Christmas tree story felt the most complete, and I liked the twist ending with Santa Claus vs. the elves. This movie wasn't a lump of coal, but I wouldn't want it in my stocking come Christmas morning.",1444003200,2,534,4.8791208791208796
7366176,5,B013JA9TIG,"This movie is a BLAST! It's 4 stories interwoven together. Similar to George A. Romero's CREEPSHOW 1982, and just as good! It's got some great jump scares and the effects are top shelf! I loved it! It's scary good fun! I will definitely be buying this when the blu-ray comes out. Check it out! You'll be glad you did! =D",1443916800,,320,4.35
7366177,4,B013JA9TIG,"This Holiday Horror anthology had something for most Horror lovers! Zombie elves,creepy kids,some good creature effects and a nice amount of well done gore plus some supernatural elements thrown in for good measure. The Stories intertwined very nicely with each other,denoting good editing .There are some pretty creepy scenes and one that has to do with a mother and her young son,that was truly chilling and cringe worthy.

I enjoyed the entire film even though there were actually four different storys going on. None  were duds. They all served up some different flavor to make this a well rounded film. It even has a twist that I never saw coming but thought was clever and made for a great ending.

(William Shatner) is a hoot as a sarcastic,tipsy radio DJ broadcasting on Christmas eve, giving us some always appreciated comic relief. This is a perfect  Horror flick to get you into the the Holiday spirit and I highly recommend it. Best Christmas based genre piece since 2010's (Rare Exports).It also has thoughtful and effective productive value!",1443744000,37,1055,4.9772727272727275
7366178,4,B013JA9TIG,I WAS THINKING THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO BE BAD BUT WAS BORED ONE DAY SO I WATCHED IT AND WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD. I ALWAYS GIVE A CHANCE TO A HORROR MOVIE ESPECIALLY IF IT LOOKS BAD BY TITLE OF THE MOVIE OR THE ART WORK SO NOW SO I TOOK A CHANCE AT THIS MOVIE AND IT PAYED OFF GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH FOR TRUE HORROR FANS.,1443312000,2,339,3.6575342465753424
7366179,4,B013JA9TIG,"Good horror anthologies are generally hard to come by especially if they're seasonally themed, so I wasn't sure what to expect from A Christmas Horror Story. Luckily the movie turned out to be surprisingly entertaining, gory, and at times even creepy. And for once there's no generic wraparound or cheesy host introducing each segment. Instead, the movie takes a more Trick 'r Treat-esque approach and has each story loosely linked together. The film goes back and forth from the individual tales, giving each enough time to develop and effectively keep the pace going by not focusing too long on a single one.

So the movie opens up to William Shatner as a disc jockey for a local radio station, who properly sets the Christmas mood before it transitions and introduces us to the start of each segment. There are four tales in total: a small group of high school students documenting some kind of quasi news report about murders that took place at a school's basement only to be haunted by a malevolent spirit; another story about a family chopping down a Christmas tree from someone's private property and discovering that the young boy they brought back home with them may not be their son at all; another family that's naughty enough to have Krampus (a buff demonic anti-Santa) hunt them down; and lastly we have a story that has an epic Santa battling a horde of zombie elves!

As expected with most (if not all) anthologies, there's always at least one weak segment in the bunch. In this case that would be the one involving the students in the basement--it's all taken place in one location and it has some pacing issues. Though it did have a couple creepy moments, so it wasn't entirely bad. In fact, if the tales weren't creeping us out, they were delivering some nice action and gore, namely in the awesome Santa segment. Though I have to say the creepiest story would have to be about the family returning home with something other than their son. There are some legit creepy and really well shot scenes in that one.

The production values were above average and the makeup and practical effects weren't bad at all, specifically for some of the gore. I don't know if it's because I went in with low expectations or what, but I had a lot of fun with this. I mean, the movie may not be as entertaining or creative as Trick 'r Treat, but it's the closest we've ever gotten.

Overall, much like what Trick 'r Treat did for Halloween, A Christmas Horror Story does for, well, Christmas. Although not as strong as Treat was, it still managed to offer some nice thrills, chills, and laughter in a nicely packaged Winter setting and I can see myself possibly revisiting it for years to come. Give this baby a look, especially if you like anthologies.",1442707200,2,2753,4.658436213991769

I love it when some actors who are past their peak selling years and are mostly retired come back to boost a small but very good film and create a lasting legacy and give local actors a start.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing this.  William Shatner is doing this for his native Canada.  His comic relief sequences and note of pathos at the end round out this film.",1514678400,,387,4.485714285714286

This movie has been out for awhile so I am going  to hazard a guess that I am not writing spoilers here.  I kept waiting for Krampus to show up in the other story lines but he did not. There was a great surprise ending where the main antagonist is revealed to be someone who had a psychological break going on rampage through a mall.  However, the other two stories are not connected in any way to the main story line. I did like how the old woman explains that Krampus is a Chrstmas spirit that can possess anyone who harbors dark pathos in their heart towards others during the Christmas season.",1499126400,,780,4.36551724137931

7366230,4,B013JA9TIG,"A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY

I am a huge horror anthology fan, from films to series, to books and all I love them. So when I first heard about this I was really excited. Then when I saw the trailer I knew I was going to love it as it looked great, plus Krampus. So when it was released on DVD I bought it immediately, called my brother, and we sat down for a fun flick. Luckily like I thought I really enjoyed it.

The stories are wrapped around William Shatners radio DJ who is working on Christmas Eve. The first story involves three friends who are filming themselves breaking into their school to investigate the basement since a fellow student was killed there. A fourth friend was supposed to be there but she had to go on a trip with her family [more on that later]. Once there things are not what they seem as something is down there with them.

The second story is about a family of three who are going into the woods to chop down a Christmas tree. Once there the son goes missing, the parents finally find him but something is not right. That becomes more and clearer after they make it home; it seems that while he is there their son may not have left the woods after all. But if it isn't their son, then what is it?

The third story is one of the ones I was really waiting for as it is about a family [including that fourth friend from earlier who couldn't join her friends] of four on their way to visit an elderly family member. Once there she tells them about the legend of Krampus. Of course they don't believe it and after the son keeps acting up they head home. They end up having a car accident and then are hunted by something in the woods, is it Krampus or someone else?

The final story is by far the most fun as it is about Santa having to battle all of his elves, well since they are now zombies. By far the most action packed and bloody of all of the stories, but what caused this. As Santa battles his former employees he also looks for answers. The answer may not be what he wants though as an old friend may be behind it.

This is a super fun anthology film as I enjoyed all of the stories. I also like how all of them are somehow or another connected. All of the writers and directors did a great job with this flick as did the actors. I do recommend all horror, anthology or Christmas movie fans check this out. The DVD comes with a nice behind the scenes feature that is fun.",1493510400,,2403,4.156989247311828

7366233,4,B013JA9TIG,"We loved this movie.  We first stumbled across it in Christmas of 2015 and looked for it this year to watch.  It's a bit dark, but I liked it.  I don't think it is something that you would have your little children watch, though Santa Claus can really throw down in this movie if you know what I mean.",1492300800,,301,4.067796610169491

7366235,5,B013JA9TIG,"This movie is one of a kind and is perfect for every Christmas Grinch. It has a very Cabin In The Woods feel with some of its slightly graphic content and humorous plot.

For a fun Christmas horror spinoff that you can watch any time of year, this movie is the perfect fix.",1491523200,,461,4.25
7366236,4,B013JA9TIG,"A Christmas Horror Story is an anthology film that has 4 interlocking stories all taking place on Christmas Eve. To tie all the stories together, Dangerous Dan, a drunken radio DJ played by William Shatner, reports from the Bailey Downs radio station on his annual double shift. Fun fact, Bailey Downs is the fictional rural Canadian city where Ginger and Brigitte Fitzgerald lived in one of my favorite horror films Ginger Snaps. Anyway, Dangerous Dan is irreverent and fun while he plays music, keeps the Christmas spirit with heavily spiked eggnog, and tries to figure out what happened to his weatherman. He and the town tie all the stories together so it feels cohesive.

The first story has three high school journalists breaking into their school to report on an unsolved murder that occurred the year before. Two students their age were ritualistically murdered in the school's basement and they want to report from there directly. At first, everything is going fine. They find some remnants of the crime scene like a biblical line written on the wall in blood washed away but still visible. After being trapped in this basement, a supernatural being makes itself known. This murder is connected to a girl's death in the past when the school was a convent. While this segment was atmospheric, the story wasn't as developed as the others.

The second story focuses on the family of a police officer who went on leave after investigating the modern murder from the previous segment. He takes his family to illegally cut down a tree from someone else's land. His son was lost for a few minutes, but he returns unharmed. When they return home, his demeanor is entirely different as he refuses to speak, sneaks around the house, and lashes out violently. The changeling concept is a cool one that isn't seen very much. The kid was extremely creepy and this segment had a lot of suspense and a few very uncomfortable scenes. I liked the balance of reality and fantasy. This segment is better than the first, but had a small flaw in some unreasonable reactions.

The third story involves a family that's lost the Christmas spirit. A man, his wife, and their two children (one who is friends with the teens in the first segment) travel a long way to meet their estranged and rich grandmother. The entire way, everyone bickers and snipes at each other. The reason for visiting isn't reconnecting with family like the father said, but to try to get money from her. After being stranded in the snow, they realize they are being stalked by Krampus, who is portrayed much differently here than usual. His skin is snow white and he has an extremely buff human torso with an animal-like face topped with horns. Krampus traditionally carries chains, but this one uses them to attack those he punishes. This segment was the most fun thanks to the wonderful practical effects of the creature and the memorable changes to the tradition folklore.

The last story has Santa fighting against zombified elves in the North Pole. This isn't the bowlful of jelly Santa, but more like wrestler or a very aged Thor. He uses his super strength and golden shepherd's crook (just like St. Nick) to decapitate and maim the elf zombies. Elves shouldn't be able to die at all, but they all suddenly become infected with this zombie disease. The concept seems to be Santa fighting against the death of the Christmas spirit at first which I thought is a cool and delightfully cheesy way to portray it. At first, I enjoyed the segment, but it doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the stories. The ending of this segment completely ties everything into a cohesive whole and solidified my love for the movie.

Each story has its own flavor, but feels like the direction and look are all the same even though it was made by 3 different directors. Not all of these stories are the best, but the film is overall fun to watch. The last story is my favorite by a long shot for its use of zombies and the hardhitting ending. I especially liked that the segments are cycled through many times instead of doing each segment individually to mix things up and move things along. I would definitely watch this every year along with the rest of my Christmas horror films.",1490400000,,4231,4.712162162162162

7366266,1,B013JA9TIG,"I felt compelled to write a quick review after I saw these reviews all saying how great this movie was.  I was over at a friend's house last night and this was showing on one of his cable channels so we watched it.  We figured William Shatner is in it so it can't be that bad, right?

The acting was horrendous and we surmised the writers must have been high the entire time they were writing the script.  Even William Shatner seems to recognise this is total camp and is just hamming it up.

We were laughing through a lot of this film.  It is a mishmash of tired horror tropes.  However, if you go into this knowing that it is a campy horror movie and that's what you're in the mood for then go for it and have some fun.  (The 5.7 rating on IMDB is really generous).

What annoys me is when you see a film with hardly any reviews but all of them are glowing - you know it has to be people connected with the film.  Believe me, I would much rather have spent my time watching a great movie - and then writing a great review.  However, it is dishonest to lie to people for the sole purpose if tricking them into watching something.  I really wish Amazon could do something about this.",1482624000,,1184,4.144736842105263

This is a terrific horror anthology, and I usually don't like horror mixed with Christmas themed anything, but this really worked. It's like a movie version of 'Welcome to Night Vale', where all sorts of crazy sh*t just happens to happen on Christmas Eve, in this seemingly cursed (for whatever reason) town. The BEST thing in this movie by far, however, is the wraparound (and through, interspersed) commentary by William Shatner's character as the DJ radio announcer guy. HILARIOUS. This one I need to buy, not just rent, so I can watch it every Halloween (and come to think of it, every Christmas, too, lol). This one's definitely worth the watch. The only story I thought was a bit weaker than the rest was the one about Krampus, but all the other stories were pretty darn good, especially the one about the family that goes into the woods to cut down their own Christmas tree. That one was C.R.E.E.P.Y. Worth the time and money to watch this. Highly recommended. Only other horror anthologies equal to this in recent years are ""Trick r Treat"" and ""Tales of Halloween"".

7366318,5,B013JA9TIG,"A Christmas Horror Story is actually several Christmas horror stories, but rather than being a traditional anthology, the movie interweaves serveral plot lines around and through each other, in much the same way Trick R Treat did.  A family visit to an estranged aunt starts going downhill when the little boy breaks a Christmas ornament of the krampus, the evil ""anti-Santa Claus"" from German folklore.  A trio of student filmmakers making a documentary about the unsolved murder that occured one Christmas ago ends up getting in deeper than they bargained for.  At the North Pole, Santa Claus must battle a zombie uprising from the elf population (seriously).  A family out hunting for a perfect Christmas tree loses sight of their young son; upon finding him, it's only after they return home that they start noticing how different the child seems.  And something decidedly un-Christmmas-y is going down at the local mall's annual food drive.  Acting as sort of series of framing sequences, William Shatner plays the small town DJ providing Christmas music for the set upon little town.

Although the different stories interconnect with one another, they have their own individual atmospheres.  Taken as a whole, the movie is scary, sexy, touching, funny, suspenseful and imaginative.  The North Pole story is the most out there of the group, being done as a blackly humorous tale of extreme strangeness.  The little elves are so lovable that you actually really feel bad for them when they start going zombie. The movie is well made and well acted (the acting in the North Pole story is deliberately over-the-top) and boasts particularly impressive special effects for the krampus.  Overall, this is one of the best horror anthologies ever made.",1466985600,,1749,5.101754385964912

The stories aren't told separately (like in the V/H/S series for example) instead it switches back & forth between the stories. At first I wasn't sure how id like that style in an anthology film but it worked well in this one. The different stories all involve a different kind of evil like Krampus, ghosts, zombie elves (yes you heard correct) & a changeling. The ending was also very unexpected & I didn't see it coming which is another great reason to check this out. There is some good blood & gore here as well for those that like that. I also feel every story had good atmosphere in some parts but the best I found to be in the ghost story. The only special feature is a behind the scenes feature & that's it. After seeing it for the first time I can easily see myself watching it every year around Christmas time.

The idea of having these parallel stories was cool, but none of them developed and I was left scratching my head because I wasn't always sure why certain things were happening. Second, and I'm going to be even more vague yet to avoid spoilers, the huge draw for me to watch this in the first place turned out to be a bait and switch. It left a bad taste in my mouth.

Krampus vs A Christmas Horror Story

Krampus vs. A Christmas Horror Story
By Christopher Ouellette

I have always found it interesting when Hollywood comes out with an original idea, and then I find out that there are two films with the same idea at the same time. (Twin Films) The Addams Family, The Munsters, and Bewitched all started and ended at the same time. Antz and A Bugs Life. Babe and Gordy. After Earth and Oblivion. And this Christmas, there are both Krampus and A Christmas Horror Story, which advertises a fight between Santa and Krampus. Both were pre-released as VOD, but only Krampus made it to theaters.

First off, they both really live up to their names. A Christmas Horror Story is just that. Its a horror flick with blood, killing, monsters, psychos, and ghosts. Krampus is a straight monster flick. Family trapped in the house with a creature coming for them. It seemed very appropriate that Universal was the distributor.

A Christmas Horror Story is four shorts intertwined. There are teens trapped in a haunted school basement. One family accidently brings home a changeling instead of their child, while another runs from Krampus in the woods. Finally, Santa battles his own elves as a zombie virus infects them all. The stories happen in the same town and are all linked by the local DJ, played by the films big get, William Shatner. As he simply drinks himself into an alternatingly jolly and depressing stupor, he buffers each story.

shatner

There is a very dank feel to everything. Almost grindhouse, with a weirdly obvious avoidance of nudity. (They include a sex scene and a shower scene.) The effects are not the best, but the director knows how to use them. You will jump a couple of times and say eeuww. The Santa stuff is the most fun of the interlaced chapters, but all of them are engaging enough. The strange thing about the film is that it takes the idea that anyone can be the monster to an extreme, as well as being a weird take on repentance. Most movies that deal with monsters have some moral key that saves you. In this film, confessing your wrongs always precedes your death. The only story without a character verbalizing their missteps starts with the standard teen slut character going home and exiting the narrative. The one who bears the brunt of the ghost is the virgin good girl. I could tell there was craft going on, but I was always aware of what they were doing. The filmmakers were putting in scares while turning horror tropes on their ears. I was often surprised by this film, but after, I was just befuddled as to why they did what they did other than to be different. I constantly felt like the movie was trying to tell me something, but I was never sure what. By the end, even the Santa story is robbed of its fun, and the emotional moments it had, felt a bit like a cheat. It also severs the supernatural string I thought was linking the story and chalks it up to coincidence. I think that this would be an entertaining film, but its oddly agnostic nihilism left me feeling blah instead of shocked, haunted, or adrenalized.

So as we walk away from a DJ spinning old yuletide vinyl and drunkenly musing something about being nice to people over the holiday, we turn our attention next to Krampus.

krampvskramp

Where the former develops characters by common horror tropes, Krampus introduces us to stock sitcom characters that we recognize instantly. Still they got the people who play them best on TV to recreate them here, so they are well done stock characters. As I said, this is a monster movie. The child rejects the idea of Santa Claus and gives up hope. This opens the door for Krampus, Santas evil counterpart, to move in.

The feel of this film is not like the live action Grinch, where Jim Carrey played the Grinch and Ron Howard played Tim Burton, but Im sure that Krampuss director, Michael Dougherty, has Batman Returns on his DVR. Actually, from this film I can divine that his collection includes Gremlins, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Coralline, and a couple offerings from non-Kermit Jim Henson works and Rankin and Bass. Still, its never parody or theft but reverent homage that brings up nostalgic feelings. This film seems to be very informed by the world of Christmas specials, starting early on with a clip from a black and white A Christmas Carol.

While the film may not need a lot of editing to put it on TV, the threats still feel very real. I would put it on the level of The Monster Squad in a lot of ways. Most of the creatures are masked, but enough of it is moved to know there is something truly horrifying underneath. This film has great pacing and the actors are all giving it their best. I won't be raving about this but it was fun. Where the last one just told us, its Christmas so you might as well buck up (even though you are all possessed monsters), this has a bit more of an up note about Christmas Spirit, love, and sacrifice. Its sort of the average of the lessons from the most popular perennial Christmas animations. (They even give an animated elf on an iPad Linuss speech.)

 Spoiler 

As we got to the final confrontation, I started really fearing that we were getting to be all a dream and in a way, it was. Though the feeling of a cheat quickly dissipates with the realization that the dream, in a Charles Dickens way, all happened.

In conclusion, it is just ironic that they both came out at the same time. They deliver what they promise. Christmas Horror and Christmas Monsters. Still, Krampus has a bigger budget and thus could get better effects and more seasoned seasonal actors. I also like the straight story and encouraging ending of Krampus<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krampus-Blu-ray/dp/B018Y5DOEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krampus [Blu-ray</a>]",1455840000,,5902,4.72568093385214

7366468,2,B013JA9TIG,"This movie is a hilariously confused bit of cinema.  It cannot decide if it is a zombie film, demon possession film, a fairy film, a troll changeling film, a Christmas film, Krampus film, etc. so it tries to be all of them and hope we don't notice.  Yes, it is THAT RIDICULOUS.

There is no ""great battle"" between Krampus and Santa.  In fact, I have no idea why either of them are in the film.  Krampus is not explained.  His iteration in the film makes no sense.  Santa is forced to become a zombie-elf killer.  I have no idea why.  The zombie elves are funny, but I'm not sure they're supposed to be.

Basically, without spoiling too much, I only remember three separate story lines that have almost nothing to do with each other.  And they each deal with different monsters.  Which would be great, if the stories were interesting and interwoven.

Only rent this.  Do not be a dork, like me, and buy it.  I loved the IDEA this movie put forth, but it delivers NONE OF IT.

It is a C to B level horror movie with some good acting, some terrible acting, and a lot of fake gore.

Krampus is the biggest let-down.  What a bore.  Looks like he walked out of Party City.  The elves and the changeling were a little creepy, if that helps.

7366496,4,B013JA9TIG,"If you're looking for a campy Christmas horror anthology with a berserk Santa Claus, changeling shapeshifters, Krampus, creepy kids, zombie elves and evil seductive spiritsthen this is for you!  Its a decent flick if you don't go in expecting much.

This playful little holiday horror anthology opens with the general feel of a higher quality ScyFy Channel movie-of-the-week.  But once it gets going the gore is more than adequate and there are some decently fun jump scares.  So I didn't exactly have a bad feeling about thisjust don't expect high quality filmmaking and you should be fine.

This anthology bounces back-and-forth between four linked horror stories that cant seem to agree when it comes to tone.  As something of a wraparound story between segments, we have William Shatners silliness as a radio show host.  Hes okay, not great, maybe a fraction as charming as intended.  But he did his jobhe got me to watch this movie after I saw him in the trailer and I chuckled at his scenes.  LOL.  One little Easter egg is that Ginger Snaps and A Christmas Horror Story are both set in the fictitious town of Bailey Downs.

The first story introduces a group of young documentary filmmakers producing Horror in the Hallways about a years-past serial killing in their high school.  It seems to take itself rather seriously while tryingand failingto embrace the notion of personable characters who don't know what they're getting into like Grave Encounters (2011).

After our introduction to the first and more serious story, the tone shifts to something more tongue-in-cheek.  Evidently the elderly have a special intuition when it comes to the evils of Krampusand they tend not to warn others for some reason!  In Krampus (2015) the grandmother knows what evil looms but says little (and nothing clearly or in English) to try to save anyone.  In this movie, the elderly great aunt kicks out her nephew and his family after his tween son deliberately breaks a Krampus figurine.  Clearly an unforgivable offensebut the kid was being a little punk.

Meanwhile at the North Pole, after a self-mutilating accident in Santas workshop an elf becomes patient zero in a zombie outbreak of Santas little helpers.  Now the tone has transmuted into fully slapstick, gory silliness.

Then our fourth tale, about a child behaving strangely on Christmas eve, is 100% serious.  Its hard to talk about this one without ruining it.  So Ill leave it at that.  But its a neat little short.

These short films often feel sort of cheaplike they were the gems found in a Walmart horror movie bargain bin but just fit for Video-on-Demand. This movie is certainly joyously entertaining for horror fans, but its symptoms of weak filmmaking are readily apparent.  The young filmmakers lines are poorly written, Krampus evidently hunts his cheerless victims by obliviously walking into traffic (like some stupid Sasquatch movie) and hoping the driver swerves into a wreck in lieu of running him over (although later he hunts them in a more appropriately fun manner), Santas expository dialogue was awful (but maybe funny in that respect), there were basically zero good camera shots, a girl gets possessed and immediately starts seducing teenagers with such Shakespearian prose as I know you always wanted me, and this was largely written like an R-rated childrens story that had to clearly and slowly verbalize EVERYTHING as if it was made for toddlers.  There is also no real development.  Krampus is mentioned, something bad happens, and now suddenly everyone talks about Krampus as if they have always believed in him.  Sillyjust dumb and silly.

Furthermore, none of the mysteries are explained.  And no, they're not the kinds of things that are better left unexplained.  Directed by Brett Sullivan (Ginger Snaps 2), Steven Hoban (producer on Ginger Snaps), Grant Harvey (Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning), Im not surprised by the randomness of quality and storytelling in this filmas this can be witnessed when comparing Ginger Snaps movies to one another.  Just look at the varying quality in their respective werewolf movies.

But this movie was not without its share of bad horror charm.  Seeing Santa slaughtering his elves was a great concept.  Even if the action/killing scenes were ill-executed at times, it always had me grinning even if I was rolling my eyes while I was enjoying the wholesale elf murder and dismemberment.  I enjoyed the mass elficide.  Krampus looked pretty cool and basically went all Mortal Kombat wielding his hooked chain like Scorpion.  And I loved how the Krampus-Santa battle transitioned us to the surprisingly satisfying ending.

This is not a good movie, but its a very enjoyable one!  Highly recommended to horror fans especially around the holiday!",1451952000,3,4773,5.045977011494253

7366500,5,B013JA9TIG,"It seemed like Krampus was everywhere this past holiday season.  From books to movies, a revitalized interest in the Austro-Bavarian Alpine folklore was definitely sparked by the 2015 movie version directed by Michael Dougherty.  There have actually been quite a few films based on the tale and you can find them in bargain bins and Netflix.  ""Krampus: The Christmas Devil"" (2013) and ""Krampus: The Reckoning"" (2015) are two that I've noticed but this one entitled ""A Christmas Horror Story"" (2015) caught my attention while browsing around some of the new releases at my local big box store.  The cover is quite interesting with what appears to be Santa Claus getting ready to do battle with some demonic looking beast.  I smirked and just tossed it back thinking that it was probably absolutely ridiculous and it was just another attempt to cash in on the Krampus hype.

I can't remember exactly how...but I stumbled upon the movie again.  I blame it on the Krampus.  This time, in the form of a movie trailer.  Once I saw Santa Claus battling it out with Zombie elves and going all gladiator with the Christmas demon...William Shatner being...Shatner and some melodramatic dialogue thrown in, I had to see it!  Seeing the preview reminded me a little of the ""Evil Dead"" movies.  Gore, fun, and just shamefully entertaining.  I've got to say that this one isn't bad at all.  I wish I had picked it up earlier because I had a lot of fun watching it and found it a great way to go numb to the world for 1 hour and 47 minutes and just enjoy this bizarre story.  Now, when I say story, you'll actually find four stories in this movie.  I was actually surprised and a little confused at first because the story started jumping around from one group of characters to another.  It's kind of like another film that I really enjoyed that came out in 2007 entitled ""Trick 'r Treat"".  Interestingly enough, this movie was written and directed by Michael Dougherty, whose new Krampus movie seems to be what started the renewed interests in the Krampus rage for 2015.  Anyway, ""A Christmas Horror Story"" has some delightfully frightening (and silly) stories that all become connected in some way and I found them to be fun to watch.  There are some squeamish moments...laughable ones...and surprising bits thrown in too.  There is a surprising twist at the end that really is done quite well and I honestly enjoyed the movie a lot.  Don't let the cover fool you!  It looks a little silly but this is actually a great film to see.  I recommend!",1451692800,,2532,4.691609977324263

7366518,5,B013JA9TIG,"This is the same film which has the PC cover title ""A Holiday Horror Story"" being sold in Walmart. The film opens with 4-5 subplots and each builds slowly until the stories are connected, even if loosely connected.

1) The first subplot consists of Santa (George Buza) and his wife Marta (Debra McCabe) getting ready for Christmas when an elf zombie outbreak happens. ""Stay back Jingles!""
2) Dangerous Dan (William Shatner) is a radio host on Christmas eve. He brings in the Christmas spirit by saying things like ""Let's throw another eggnog on the fire."" There is an unknown commotion going on at the mall.
3) Three high school kids, Dylan, Ben and Molly (Shannon Kook, Alex Ozerov, Zo De Grand Maison ) are doing some investigative reporting at St. Joseph Academy where 2 kids were brutally killed last year. The school also has a story of a supposed virginal conception and abortion.
4) Officer Scott (Adrian Holmes) who investigated the murders is together with his wife and child this Christmas. He is setting a bad example by poaching a tree off of posted land.
5) A family visits their rich aunt (Corinne Conley) in hopes of getting her to invest in a company. While there, the insolent teen Duncan (Percy Hynes White) breaks an old statue of a Krampus.

The film takes place in the fictional town of Baily Downs (Ginger Snaps, Orphan Black). Krampus has become the latest rage in Christmas horror films, and in that regard, this one is the best. In fact, I would go as far as to say I enjoyed this as much as the iconic ""Silent Night Deadly Night.""  There was scene where I was lulled into a false sense of security and then they made me jump. I haven't done that in a while.

7366524,3,B013JA9TIG,"I enjoy the genre... But I really can't find any redeeming qualities in this feature. Trilogys are not a new idea, but it is a bit confusing when all three are told at the same time by jumping in and out of each other... I think the quick, loud ""swish"" sound is WAY overused for scare effect... The creature is a good concept. Just my opinion... Parlous1",1449964800,,354,4.298507462686567
7366525,4,B013JA9TIG,"It was strange. But it was also reminiscent of Rod Serling's style of story telling, especially with reference to the ending. Some folks down-rate the way this tale ends...I found it quite acceptable. But then, I am a huge Serling fan. I down-rated it only because the jump factors were too few. There was at least one good one, and then a few minor ones, but all in all this was not what I would call HORROR. There was nothing here that horrified me. The characters didn't seem all that horrified either. And that played into my four star rating as well. The Acting/Directing was a little poor. I think the reason for this was that there were three directors. This more often than not results in a movie that is somewhat discombobulated.

Nevertheless, it was worth a watch. I would never have considered it had William Shatner not been involved. His role ties the whole thing together and who doesn't love Shatner?? I am a former radio host, so his role here was interesting and close to home for me.

You will not have any nightmares after watching this, unless you really needed the money you spent. I'd say MOST should rent it rather than buy it. I doubt many will watch this over and over.....unless they really needed the money they spent.",1449705600,3,1246,4.558035714285714

These are all good stories and well acted and I did get a few frights now and then. The morals....change your evil ways.....don't follow the girl to the haunted school and keep a better eye on the kid.

7366528,4,B013JA9TIG,"Christmas Horror Story will definitely become a holiday cult classic sometime down the road along with Black Christmas and Silent Night Deadly Night. This is the Christmas equivalent to Trick 'r Treat. There are four different interwoven stories. This review WILL contain some spoilers! The first story is pretty weak. It's about a group of teenagers investigating the school's basement. A year prior, there were some murders. The teens get locked in and forced to deal with a ghost. The second story is a little better and creepier; a family goes into a forest to find the perfect Christmas tree. During this time, the son goes missing. He's found, but begins to act very strange. The third story is okay. A disgruntled family are forced to go visit their aunt, only to be kicked out and attacked by the Krampus. The fourth and final story is probably my favorite. Santa Claus is getting ready to go out and deliver toys to the kids, but his elves are slowly transformed into crazy zombies. It all leads up to a twist you'll never see coming and an epic battle featuring Santa vs. Krampus.

7366531,5,B013JA9TIG,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Just in time for Christmashorror, carnage, and more!  A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY blasted onto store shelves last week, and let me state right off:  this is one movie you must see this holiday season!  I wasn't sure what to expect going into it, but I was hoping for some crazy, terrifying fun based on the plot synopsis.  I mean, who can pass up zombie elves??  I am very happy to report this film exceeded my expectations.  It is a new holiday classic that I see myself revisiting every year around this time.

The more I watch holiday-themed horror, the more I like it.  Theres just something about horrifying situations popping up during happy seasons that draws me in.  I guess its the stark contrast between the happiness people should be feeling, with family gatherings and yuletide joy, and the terror that overshadows that in these films that I really enjoy.  This seems to make the tension even more real to me.

A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY is shot well and appears to have a high production budget.  The cohesiveness of the film is tight, and this aspect is especially impressive when considering three different directors had a hand in creating the five segments for this film.  This is also a big reason the movie scores so high with me.

And speaking of scores, the music in the film is phenomenal.  It fits the movie perfectly, and I found it very reminiscent of something Danny Elfman or Marco Beltrami might do.  I would even go so far as to say Id love to have it on CD.

The acting is very good, with several top-notch actors heading up a great cast.  William Shatner shines as the radio DJ, Dangerous Dan.  George Buza gives a powerful and convincing performance as a zombie-elf-killing Santa.  Likewise, Rob Archer is very imposing and believable as Krampus.  The rest of the cast meshes well, and the result is a well-rounded and talented group.

The special effects in A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY are impressive as well.  The makeup for the zombie-elves and Krampus are superb, and the small bit of gore we get to see looks realistic.  I also love the opening sequence, tooit is an intriguing entry-point for the film, and the CG is impressive.

A CHRISTMAS HORROR STORY is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it.  Chocked full of intensity and fun, this is one holiday horror flick you won't soon forget.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1449187200,,2445,4.597222222222222
7366532,5,B013JA9TIG,"I love christmas and horror movies what a treat this felt like watching the supernatural tv show.

This was a fun scary gorey movie with a great twist at the end that will leave you speechless like someone screwed you good with your mind. In this movie we get zombie elves, a killer revengeful ghost , changling creatures , most important krumpus and santa clause  this all takes place in a small town baileys down. so relax sit back rent or buy or download this be ready to be scaried and mind played most important have a merry christmas.",1449187200,,1054,4.345177664974619
7366533,4,B013JA9TIG,"If you're a fan of the film Trick R Treat, you'll enjoy this Christmas version very much. Actually, any fan of Christmas and horror films should enjoy this. A Christmas Horror Story tells 4 stories of Christmas terror. A young couple and their son trespass on private property for a Christmas tree and bring home something evil. A dysfunctional family visiting relatives, run into a very evil looking Krampus. A group of students investigating a dark story about a local school go face to face with ghosts. The north pole is under attack from Krampus and an army of walking dead elves. William Shatner is quite good as a radio DJ who keeps us updated on the terrible things going on in the town.

Solid production, acting, directing and I loved the creepy holiday score!

Scores points for being original, clever, scary and quite fun! I actually like this better than the 2015 release of 'Krampus'

I always try to watch the ""weird"" holiday movies, and 90% of them are just what you expect. But A Christmas Horror Story truly surprised me. The movie is just fun, and more so than that, it is a fun way to escape the tedium the holidays can sometimes bring. It isn't really scary, it's quite predictable in some parts, and the pacing in some parts could be better. But, it's well put together, inventive, outrageously tacky (in a great way), and to top it off, Williams Shatner's character is the holiday narrator I want for my life.
So, gather the family (minus the little ones) and give this movie a watch this holiday season.",1449100800,,774,4.381944444444445
7366537,3,B013JA9TIG,Not as good as I expected,1449014400,,25,3.3333333333333335
7366538,5,B013JA9TIG,"The movie felt like a Christmas version of the film, ""trick or treat."" It followed the same concept/ idea, however, instead of the movie revolving around a Halloween theme, it instead revolved around Christmas. This film had several different stories occurring at the same time. Do not confuse this movie with the sort of film, which deals with one story at a time (like the movie ""creep show""). Instead this film, as I had written above, had several different stories occurring at once. One minute you're watching the teenagers locked in the basement, and then the movie shifts to two adults- concerned about their child's bizarre behaviors.
At first I became frustrated with this film, because I thought that all the people/occurrences in the movie some how connected to each other. However, I was wrong. I tried to piece all the movie segments, in my mind, together, and just couldn't do it. I believed that some how Krampus had something to do with all the situations that were occurring in this film. I wish I would have known that this was not the case, and I could have enjoyed the film more. For those who are into the Krampus theme this movie does not make him the main villain. There is no one villain/ horror character in this film (just like in the movie ""trick or treat""). Krampus only had one story in this film (where he is suppose to be real). However, there was also a final story, which involved him, but in an entirely different way.
As I watched the last story unfold (Santa vs Krampus) I once again thought, ""is the director trying to tie the stories together (ones that involved Krampus)? The answer was no, but I LOVED THE ENDING anyway.
I will watch this movie again, and I know I will enjoy it more the second time (now that I KNOW the purpose to each story)
Some additional information:
(1) This movie, unless you are new to the horror genre, is not scary. I would say that the only scary parts of this film were the jump scare moments. However, This movie can be intense at times, and also has its creepy moments.
(2) This movie is not perfect. It does have its moments of bad dialogue, bad acting, and so on. However, the overall performances/ movie are good. This movie is hard to explain when it comes to it's build. It is not a college student style film, but it is not perfect Hollywood style either. However, if I had to put it on a scale of college, to Hollywood style, I WOULD say that it was way closer to Hollywood style-good.
This movie is meant more for people who want a little horror put into their Christmas this year. Another reason that I loved this film was because, not only was a lot of effort put into making it, but unlike a lot of Christmas horror films it didn't try to be funny/silly horror (like ""Silent Sleigh""), or B-rated bizarre horror (like, ""Christmas Evil""). Don't get me wrong, there are one or two moments where the director added in some subtle jokes, but it wasn't enough to ruin the film.
This film was not perfect, but it was refreshing to watch, especially compared to the typical clich Christmas movie crud out there these days.
 I also liked how there were very few S-x scenes. As the movie played (watching the teenagers kissing) I thought, ""oh brother,"" I waited for endless drug, and S-x scenes. However, there was only one scene, and it was nothing graphic. Maybe this lack of S-x is a downer for most, but for people like me (who have seen a lot of s-x in horror movies) it was a refreshing change of pace. It reminds people that they don't have to have loads of love making to make a horror movie good/ interesting.",1448928000,2,3590,4.489296636085627

7366540,4,B013JA9TIG,"I have to admit I knew nothing about this film other than what I read from all the reviews so I thought, why not!  I love horror movies, I love Christmas and Christmas movies and I love Shatner's overacting--it seemed like the perfect trifecta.  Since I received my blu ray on Friday, I have not stopped watching this movie...far more than what I expected. Let's start with Shatner--he is excellent in the role and he does not, let me repeat does not over emote.  He plays the part of the DJ perfectly, not corny or campy but as you actually might expect a DJ in a similar situation to respond. I was beyond surprised and disappointed---I so wanted the over acting Captain Kirk. The movie is four distinct stories, but unlike many have stated only one of the stories interconnects with itself---it is the surprising ending (and it is a surprise). The other three stories really are stories in themselves and in no way has to do with the one other story.  Try and guess when watching as which one will surprise you in the end.  That is the part of the movie which I loved. I read as most said there is a surprise ending,but I never expected what happened. The writing and direction are surprisingly well done and the cast works well in each of their respective venues. I would not say it is as much in the way of horror as I would have prefered but you can only go so far with Christmas without crossing a fine line. The cliches are kept to a minimum, the dialogue is not sappy and the effects are well done but do not take away from the stories--meaning the stories could stand alone without any special effects. I am extremely glad I purchased this and added it to both my horror and Christmas movies---it sits right next to A CHRISTMAS STORY, with Ralphie Parker---WOW, imagine that movie in horror form.

7366567,4,B013JA9TIG,"First I would like to mention that another review mentions that ""Krampus the star of the film"" doesn't show up until close to the end.  I think they are mistaking this film for another.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krampus-The-Christmas-Devil/dp/B016568JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krampus -  The Christmas Devil</a>&nbsp;Either ""Krampus - The Christmas Devil"" or the ""Krampus"" movie with Toni Collette that comes out later this year.

For ""A Christmas Horror Story"", the final twist made this 4 stars for me.  For most of the movie, there was only one story line that I could get into, but they were all connected to each other by at least one character.  They used a lot of jump scares, but not a lot of outright gore.  Let's look at these one by one..

1.  Something's wrong with Santa's elves - Santa is having trouble with the elves in the workshop and it's not the usual issues of contract negotiation through their union rep or whatever a ""normal"" elf issue is.  This seems to be part of the framing device used for the story, obviously because it's a Christmas themed horror movie and it's Santa.  I dreaded the parts with Santa and the elves.  They were great as far as gore, but I like a little less whimsy with my horror movie slaughterfest.  I could not keep up with these parts at all, but when they finally explained everything, I loved it.

2.  There's a radio DJ, played by William Shatner, doing his annual all day long Christmas Eve broadcast.  Hilarious break from the macabre as Shatner's DJ gets drunk on spiked eggnog as the radio show progresses.  Me, being a Star Trek geek, really loved seeing the sloshed Shatner overact his way through these parts.  I couldn't understand for a while how they tied in, but everyone at some point did listen to a radio, plus other little things connected it here and there.

3.  Teens go into a spooky place - The usual horror story.  Two guys and a girl have a school project and want to film a place where a death occurred a year before on Christmas Eve.  The girl used to babysit the son of the cop that investigated the murder and they get the keys to the place from the girlfriend of one of the guys.  I liked this plot throughout the movie as this was the most typical horror movie story-line of the film.  I didn't really like the explanation of everything, but it was acceptable and could have stood on it's own as a horror film.

4.  Family Trip - The aforementioned girlfriend has a last minute family trip to a relatives house for Christmas Eve.  The trip doesn't go at all as planned when the flawed family has car trouble.  As soon as they had car trouble, I yawned and decided these might be bathroom break segments.  But I hung in there and was rewarded with a good ending.  I just couldn't ""like"" any of the family members, but I don't think I was meant to.

5.  Bad Example for a Cop - Pretty sure the cop's wife said this, which is what I was thinking when the cop, his wife and his son take a trespassing trip to chop down a Christmas tree.  As with most of the film, anyone who has read any kind of mythology will be able to call what's going on as soon as they get the tree home.  This is where you will scream at the screen the most to let the characters know they are being stupid.  Neutral feelings about this one.  Not enough happened, but I guess for a parent, too much may have happened.

Overall, the first three parts I mentioned made this film a 3 for me.  How they tie it all together in the end is absolutely brilliant and bumped the rating up to 4 stars.",1445126400,27,3594,4.5162790697674415
