8627679,5,B00GUV73SK,"I found Will Hollady's video most useful even though I've rowed the canyon seven times and about to embark on my eighth trip. It showed me routes I hadn't considered before and reminded me what to do on ones I have. The special rowing techniques needed in big water of the Grand Canyon were well illustrated and explained. I think this video is a must-see for anyone rowing or paddling down the Canyon, novice or experienced.",1413504000,,425,4.605263157894737
