After watching as much as I could sit through without falling asleep, I repeatedly fast forwarded the program hoping for it to improve but it never did. It very slowly and tediously covered information about some of the architectural details of some of the buildings, with the occasional mention of who lived there at one time and what they might have done for a living. No interesting stories about them. No interesting stories of any kind. And... Nothing to inspire enthusiasm for the buildings themselves or to make the town seem the least bit appealing. Even the photography was boring. They might as well have shown still photographs.",1388275200,,698,4.873949579831932
8590132,5,B00D6VOCVS,"One of the things I love about England is how it is just jam-packed with interesting historical locations.  I had never heard much about the town of Warwick, so I was interested to see this DVD and learn more about it.  I was amazed at all the fascinating things that are located in a relatively small area.  A town existed on the site since Anglo-Saxon times.  In 1694 a fire devastated Warwick, burning down most of the existing buildings.  Some of the old buildings do still exist, as well as ""new"" buildings that were constructed under stricter regulations following the fire.  The film is narrated by Dr. Sylvia Pinches, who gives an amazing amount of detail about the locations.  She points out beautiful architectural details that might go unnoticed by the casual visitor.  Some of the places that are discussed include the Collegiate Church of St. Mary (where Robert Dudley, Queen Elizabeth I's reported lover, is buried), the Lord Leycester Hospital, St. Mary Immaculate Church (where J.R.R. Tolkien married in 1916), and Mill Garden.  We also learn some interesting historical facts, such as where the term ""eavesdropping"" comes from, and why historians don't mind graffiti.  The only bad thing about watching this film is that after watching you'll be ready to book a trip to Warwick to see all the gorgeous locations for yourself!  Extras include a map of the locations, extra interviews with some of the local experts from the film, and visitor information.

I received a review copy of this DVD from Leofric Films.",1371772800,2,1528,4.92578125
