2659098,5,B000IMVO4Q,"One of the most visually and musically synchronized DVDs that I have ever seen yet. This is the new cutting-edge in this genre beyond a doubt. In fact, after reading the book, then watching this author's Gnosis DVD, I was stunned to find that I, too, finally understood the secrets of Solomon's Temple and Freemasonry. This was especially important to me as my great-grandfather was a Scottish stone mason that had been hired by the LDS to help in the construction of The Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City circa 1850's. Although we were not a religious family at all, -- not a member of anything secular or sacred at that time -- I started to see the significance of bloodlines, and why as an adult I chose engineering as a profession myself, at least initially. More so, everywhere I lived from the Southeastern US to the Pacific Northwest I had this compulsion to build, so I'd buy a separate plot of land close to my residence and spend every free hour constructing barns, fences and houses that I never would even live in; it was as if it were in my DNA to do manual labor. Guess what, it is and I likewise grasped the deeper meaning to the Holy Grail and the Da Vinci Code. Read this book, then watch this DVD, and you too will become alive to the legends in your family tree and the ""serpent power"" spiraling within your body-mind-spirit awaiting to manifest a whole new life in the future from your blood, sweat, and tears shed in the past!

Dr. John Jay Harper is a clinical hypnotherapist, and author of Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century.",1160006400,2,1554,4.51063829787234
2659102,3,B000IMVO4Q,"Gnosis, this DVD explains, is not simply knowledge, as defined by some, but ""the experience of the divine as self,"" ""knowledge of the most esoteric kind."" Writer Phillip Gardiner asserts that ""present orthodox history is basically incorrect. Over the last few centuries, history has been rewritten by religious and political. Basically, says Gardiner, The ""winners"" get to write their story. The only negative is that the music sometimes drowns out the narration.",1201219200,,463,5.444444444444445
2659103,1,B000IMVO4Q,"This had to be the most painful DVD experience I've ever had. The music on tis DVD was so idiotic it drowned out everything, making it completely incomprehensible.

Equally as bad as the music the producer seemed to want video of himself walking about in almost every shot. Not to mention almost the entire dvd is made up of collages of images superimposed on top of one another, making none of them clear enough to even see correctly.

I've bought hundreds of books and dvd's from Amazon and this is the first that has motivated me to actually post a review. It is that bad.

I can't even comment on what the producer said, I couldn't hear any of it. Stay away would be my advice, a total waste of money.",1197072000,24,705,4.366412213740458
2659104,1,B000IMVO4Q,"If you thought 'The DaVinci Code"" was a groundbreaking work, you'll love this video!

If, on the other hand, you actually prefer to do a little research before you jump on any old bandwagon you may find this romantic MTV fluffery to be a waste of time. Let me be clear; I agree with some (but not all) of what is proposed by the author. My objection is to what he presents as 'evidence' and furthermore, what he chooses to present as significant to proving his theories. It's all hyperbolic grasping at straws spoken in an authoritative manner so as to imply 'secret truths.' It's silly.

I wish I had a nickle for every time the author uses the words ""supposedly"" and ""therefore"". I'd probably wind up with little more than a dollar, but there are constant instances of drawing conclusions and making declarations of his fervent beliefs as if they were statements of fact right on the heels of his stating that something is unknown or a mystery.

A great example is his declaration of the meaning of ""Baphomet"". Nobody knows what this word REALLY means. There are many theories. Just check out Wikipedia--not the best source for information on these things, but they do address a few of the various proposed etymologies of the word. He simply chooses the most dramatic version (ooooohhh backwards writing! of an abbreviation yet! Those crafty Templars/Gnostics/Rosicrusians/Illuminati/Masons/Republicans!) and presents it as a fact. Look, he may be right, but only by luck. In a court of law we could throw out his entire testimony based on all the circular reasoning and sloppy, incomplete research.

So, the information presented is faulty and incomplete in crucial ways. I don't know his books. If they're are shoddy as the material presented here I wouldn't touch them with a ten-foot Caduceus Wand of the Kerux!

Now as to the production: I can't imagine what had someone make the stylistic choices that have been made here. Why all the loud Emo/Grunge/Metal intersperced with New-Agey-Enya-type-stuff? Why is the music so loud? Why all the ultra-slow-motion pans that go nowhere? Why all the multiple images layered on top of each other so that you can't clearly see anything? Why all the shots of some guy (the author??) wandering around historical sites with his mouth slack?

WHY ALL THE OBFUSCATION AND DISTRACTION?

If you have truly valuable infomation wouldn't you want to present it in a concise straightforward manner? or at least artfully? This is a mess.

...and the whole thing wraps up with a rap-metal tune. Perfect. I don't get it. Neither should you.",1192060800,7,2573,4.912442396313364
2659105,2,B000IMVO4Q,I agree with all the music comments it's absolutely annoying and at times you can't even hear the narrator!,1184457600,6,107,4.684210526315789
2659106,1,B000IMVO4Q,"I THINK THE ACTIONAL DVD HAD ALOT GOOD IMFORMATION,BUT THE MUSICAL BACK DROP DEFEATED THE HOLD PURPOSE OF THE DVD,I PERSONALLY COULD NOT ENJOY IT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE MUSIC, IT WAS TO LOUD AND THE SELECTION JUST DIDN'T BELONG TO THE DVD...",1180051200,,240,4.4772727272727275
2659107,3,B000IMVO4Q,"I'm somewhat familiar with some of this material, though I found the movie to be lacking in substance.  More so, the bad music often drowned the speaker's voice into unintelligible mumbles. You really have to focus to understand what is being said.

I cannot speak for the related book, though in all I think the movie could have used better production/management and scripting to generate a more substantive message.  If anything, the video serves best as a ""summary"" of the author's opinion/theories and may encourage one to read further.",1174867200,,540,5.044943820224719
2659108,2,B000IMVO4Q,"Too much annoying music (played at such a volume) that you can barely hear what the narrator is saying.

Very little real insight (or information) on Gnosis.

Not very long (that could be bad or good).

If one didn't know any better, you would have thought you were watching an MTV Music Video by a band named ""Gnosis"".

A pity...since a serious (in depth) video on Gnosis and the history of Gnosticism is greatly desired (and needed).",1168473600,17,435,4.6103896103896105
2659109,5,B000IMVO4Q,"Anybody watching this who does not love the beautiful imagery, wonderful underscored music and great narration must be blind, deaf and well, daft. This is a work of art which is why it won an award and as a work of Art I suppose it can be a subjective opinion on its merits. I loved every second and have watched it again and again and again. I have now bought Secrets of the Serpent, and to be honest, it's much better, but both are brilliant.",1163203200,2,444,4.235294117647059
2659110,2,B000IMVO4Q,"I had to stop the DVD about 15 min into it.

The information seems to be extremely interesting as I have been working on this thought process for years. I anxiously waited for the DVD to arrive to see what the author had to say about this topic. Unfortunately, the audio and visual quality of the material was too distracting from the presentation. I was expecting something like a Discovery or History Channel type production with images and historical facts to backup the presented material.

Instead, the ""music"" is horrible, too loud, and it's hard to undertand what the author is saying in places, and the images are a constant collage of the author walking through museums and other places overlayed with images of artifacts to the point of sheer boredoom. There seems to be no purpose of the images other than to fill the screen with something. They may mean something in the author's mind, but how about explaining them to us. After 15 min of this, I had all I could take. I plan to send this back and order the book instead.

I think the content is going to be good. But the production needs a complete rework, better yet, just make an audio CD with no music or at least dead quiet while the author is speaking! If you can get past the distractions, you might enjoy this DVD.",1163030400,8,1284,4.502145922746781
2659111,5,B000IMVO4Q,"It is a privilege to review Philip Gardiner's new DVD documentary, from his book of the same name, ""Gnosis"". Having had an interest in `Gnostics' from its historical perception, I was very interested in what this production had to say. In my own previous studies, I found it exciting that Mary Magdalene was said to have been a part of the early Gnostic community. (And I have always had an affinity for that woman.)

After the magnitude of the Da Vinci Code publications & movie on today's society... the interest in all things spiritually mystical has been heightened. Added to the personal `search' which most of mankind are currently undergoing in looking for meaning & sustenance in today's confusing and stress filled world, more and more are looking for answers... be they inner or outer. This movie will certainly answer many of those questions.

The DVD is quite pleasant to watch as well as listen to. In parts, seeming almost like an elongated musical video, very catchy & entertaining. I found it to be extremely thought-provoking and well presented. Gardiner lectures around the world, & has written numerous best selling books on the mystical.

This movie is a must see!",1160438400,7,1184,4.91
8146301,1,B000IMVO4Q,WHAT IS UP with the lousy music? I want a documentary NOT music. Sheesh. His TV shows are bad too.,1492387200,,98,3.95
8146302,5,B000IMVO4Q,"It is all connected.  Philip Gardiner spells it out for us here.  It's so ironic that what we have been seeking has been right in front of us the whole time, just waiting for us to wake up and grasp it.  Solomon's temple is a wellspring of knowledge.  Seek and you shall find.",1374883200,,276,4.150943396226415
8146303,5,B000IMVO4Q,I really enjoyed this informative presentation. Complimentary music and visuals round out this fact filled look beyond the surface of the fascinating topic of gnosis. I learned lots.,1374883200,,182,5.535714285714286
8146304,2,B000IMVO4Q,"I found this work to be boring and redundant .it was seemingly milking the same subject as many of this authors other works,and did not necessarily warrant a seperate publication to communicate the same information",1349481600,,214,5.142857142857143
8146305,1,B000IMVO4Q,"If you could hear any of the talking? it is like going to a movie to just hear the sound track and the actors are muted.  they play this cheesy music so loud it floods out the speaking to where you may be able to pick out a few words every now and then but over all extremely bad product nothing in depth  Don't waste your time , Money  & hearing on this product",1310169600,2,362,3.864864864864865
8146306,1,B000IMVO4Q,Could have been a great movie but I couldn't hear it or tolerate listening to it with all that sceamo music in the background.  So I only saw about 5 to 10 minutes of it.  Very disappointed.  I really wanted to learn more about this information.,1255392000,2,245,4.282608695652174
8146307,1,B000IMVO4Q,"Painful to watch, Superimposed photos of symbols floating around throughout the movie plus the loud music in the background made it hard to hear what the speaker was saying.

When you finally could hear what he was saying it seemed that his grandiose style and arrogance made you wish the headbanger music was louder.

A total pig. Stay away from this. It's like trying to watch the Blair Witch Project while in a bumpy airplane while you have a hangover.

Amateurish production with a boring and busy monologue.",1253145600,2,512,4.795454545454546
8146308,4,B000IMVO4Q,"Gnosis means knowledge and enlightenment. Using history, religion, and meditation we can attain the true enlightenment. The secret of the Temple of Solomon is about Gnosis and was pasted onto the Freemasons. The Freemasons understood the secret more that we do.",1236124800,,261,5.390243902439025
8146309,2,B000IMVO4Q,"Being a fan of this type of history and lore, it pains me to say that this video was almost unwatchable. I did watch it all the way through to give it a fair chance but in the end, the presentation just killed the experience.

The music was too loud when the narrator spoke, and the narrator's voice was just not distinct enough to make the information come alive (very monotone).  The video looked like it had been done on a home PC prior to the ""new and improved"" video imaging software was available.

None of it made sense, even to me being a fan of this type of genre.  I gave it 2 stars based on the information alone (only because I know it).  I am not accustomed to being this critical on topics that interest me, but I cannot in good faith recommend buying this video.  If your curiosity is burning to see it, then I would suggest borrowing from a friend or checking it out from the library (if they have it).",1235088000,3,918,4.217142857142857
8146310,3,B000IMVO4Q,Another Gardnier style documentary with interesting information but lacking quality.  Still worth your time and interest.  Not so wordy that you feel lost.  Good for experts and newbies alike.  Gardnier put the responsibility for our lives and happiness in our own hands.,1204070400,,271,5.380952380952381
