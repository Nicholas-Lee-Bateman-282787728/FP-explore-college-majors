8525868,4,B0086C5FA4,"Humorous sequel to ""Benvenuti Al Sud"" - both with English subtitles. Best seen in order.",1515369600,,88,4.933333333333334
8525869,5,B0086C5FA4,"Very funny. Continuation of Wellcome to the South. To understand the story, I recommend to watch the previous film first.",1462492800,,121,5.1
8525870,5,B0086C5FA4,Must see movie.  I have both Nord and Sud and have watched them over and over again.,1429920000,,84,3.9411764705882355

8525872,5,B0086C5FA4,"Hysterical. This movie is positively hysterical. I love comedy like this. I am of Italian origins, south of Naples. This move is about a Southerner who goes North. A sequel to Ben Venuto al Sud, which is just as funny or funnier. You have to appreciate the differences, or rather you have to care about the differences between the North and South in Italy (where I now live) to appreciate this movie, but if you don't know about them, you will learn fast. FUNNY.",1423008000,,462,4.511904761904762
8525873,5,B0086C5FA4,"After being a huge fan of the first movie, I definitely wanted to order the second one -  and I'm glad I did!  The subtitles make it very easy to understand and would recommend this as a family movie to anyone.",1399507200,,210,4.097560975609756
8525874,5,B0086C5FA4,"I thought it was very funny so I don't agree with the reviewer who says he/she is ashamed to be Italian.  My husband who was born in Northern Italy and lived there for many years (still has relatives there) really liked it and is not ashamed to be Italian after seeing it.
Italy is just like the USA - different accents, different customs in different areas, mistaken assumptions on how the others work and live,  and this movie pokes loving fun at some of those differences.  We have been spent time in Northern and Southern Italy and heard and saw this same assumptions.",1384732800,,572,4.533980582524272
8525875,3,B0086C5FA4,"Compared to its counterpart, Benvenuti al Sud (which is absolutely terrific), this movie is something of a let-down. Lost is the chemistry between the characters and the storyline that made al Sud wonderful, replaced by cheap attempts at humour and a clearly rushed screenplay (possibly fueled by the prospect of cashing in on the original). The movie is still fun and enjoyable to watch, but don't have the high expectations that I had and you probably won't be nearly as disappointed.",1384128000,2,486,5.012345679012346
8525876,5,B0086C5FA4,"So funny, and just as good as the original Benvenuti al sud.
I highly recommend seeing both movies for the continuation of histerical laughs.",1382313600,,141,4.916666666666667
8525877,1,B0086C5FA4,"Comedy is the most fragile of the arts. This film demolishes, annihilates, pulverizes it. I am embarrassed to be Italian.",1381536000,2,121,5.1
