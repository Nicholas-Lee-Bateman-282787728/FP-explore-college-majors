5241674,1,B0091G7A20,Tried to watch the pilot  but seemed to amateurish for my taste. Story was disjointed not very polished for a series.,1375315200,,117,4.571428571428571
5241675,5,B0091G7A20,"So good, just wish it was longer. Johnny Pemberton makes it all worth it though!!
It's a must see !!",1375056000,2,100,4.05
5241676,4,B0091G7A20,"The male lead is fun and interesting, but the girl of his dreams, Aimee Teegarden is anothe reason to watch the movie.",1374192000,,118,4.409090909090909
5241677,3,B0091G7A20,"The entire season is available on youtube, so don't waste your money on paying for it.  Also, the episodes are very short, under ten minutes each.",1373155200,2,146,4.615384615384615
5241678,5,B0091G7A20,"If you're the type of person who hears there's a latest book out by your favourite author then gets all upset when you get a copy and find out it is only a novella then you probably aren't going to want to check out Aim High.  Aim High goes for 55 minutes and that includes the opening and closing credits, logos and everything else for each episode so if you fast forward those aspects, the whole viewing will take you around 40 minutes at most.  These episodes originally screened as webcasts, not on the TV so each episode is pretty short.  Being a webcast you might be thinking it's going to be low budget with no name actors, neither of these things is true.  The storyline granted probably would have benefited if padded out if this was a half hour show on TV every night or a feature film but what is there is still very entertaining.  It's not realistic, but hey it's a film where teenagers (played by actors in their late 20s/30s) try and survive high school where one (Nick Green) also has to survive encounters with well armed criminals and terrorists outside of school hours.

Nick Green is played by Jackson Rathbone (Twilight) and does a pretty good job portraying a junior in high school.  His character is pretty witty and resourceful.  You'll spot other well known actors as well Matthew Moy (2 Broke Girls), Johnny Pemberton plays Nick's best friend Marcus, (The Watch, 21 Jump Street, This is 40), Aimee Teegarden (Friday Night Lights) plays the girl Nick wants to sleep with whose attention makes Nick the target of school bully and her boyfriend Derek. Gregg Germann (Ally McBeal, House of Lies) does a good job as the vice principal, Natalie Lander (The Middle) plays an upherself socially popular student, and Rebecca Madder (Lost) plays another love interest for Nick although an inappropriate one in that she's his teacher.

The DVD also comes with the full music video for All Better Now sung by Aimee Teegarden which we only saw a glimpse of in the episode, a couple of minute documentary on the character Nick Green as well as Video Yearbook starring Natalie Lander interviewing various characters in the school and highlighting their positions in the school social hierarchy by doing so. This is a good chance at a deeper look at some minor characters.",1370822400,4,2281,4.696741854636591
5241679,5,B0091G7A20,I was sooooooooooo excited the day that I got this dvd.  I took it and my puter with me to take my daughter to her meeting.  Was well worth the wait.  I love the video yearbook and behind the scenes we got to see.  Keep up the great work.  Can't wait for season 2.,1352332800,,264,3.814814814814815
5241680,5,B0091G7A20,"This was a fantastic short series that was created and broadcast as webisodes on Facebook. Stellar cast, great action. And a definite must for Jackson Rathbone fans!",1346889600,2,165,5.148148148148148
5241685,5,B0091G7A20,I love this DVD. Jackson Rathbone even more.,1452124800,,44,4.625
5241686,1,B0091G7A20,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!! EACH EPISODE IS 10MIN OR LESS.........,1451952000,,62,5.3
5241687,2,B0091G7A20,sorry i cant even rem.watching this so it must have been bad,1448323200,,60,4.083333333333333
5241688,1,B0091G7A20,was constantly skipping scenes and had audio play-back problems. the story line it self was to confusing even for the adult mind,1447891200,,128,4.863636363636363
5241689,1,B0091G7A20,"This video is only 7 minutes long, and over one minute is credits.  Cool idea.  Poor execution.  Not worth $1.99.  Not worth anything.  You know everything that is and will happen in this incredibly short show just by reading the summary.  So don't bother.  Seriously, don't bother.  How anyone could rate this over 1 star is baffling.  Is this a test to see how many people click buy before they look at the video run-time?  There's a certain expectation involved here, that's not being met.  Is this a farce, a con, a gimmick?  Seriously, what is it?  Because it's not a TV series, that's for sure.",1447804800,4,600,4.547169811320755
5241690,1,B0091G7A20,Lot of bad language!,1447286400,,20,4.25
5241691,1,B0091G7A20,"LOOK AT THE LENGTH OF THE EPISODES!!

This is a complete rip-off! They are nothing but snippets and are NOT an episode by any stretch of the imagination.

I did not look at the written reviews and paid $1.99 for an ad.",1445990400,,218,4.166666666666667
5241692,4,B0091G7A20,Only six episodes?,1444348800,,18,5.333333333333333
5241693,5,B0091G7A20,this could have been a great show weekly but the shows were too short,1443744000,,69,4.0
5241694,1,B0091G7A20,I ordered epidosde 1 which turned out to be a 7 minute preview of the show.  For $1.99 this is incredibly lame.  Don't spend the money.,1441670400,,135,4.153846153846154
5241695,5,B0091G7A20,Need more seasons lots more! Great show!!!,1440979200,,42,5.142857142857143
5241696,1,B0091G7A20,No episode is longer than 10 mins and they are $1.99? WTH?!?,1439942400,6,60,4.083333333333333
5241697,5,B0091G7A20,"I almost cried when I realized there were no more episodes. This show is awesome. I don't understand how the main actor is able to pull of playing a teenager, but he does it spectacularily. There are not a lot of tv shoes or movies about young spies that are well written, actually interesting, and not made for children, so I was so happy when I found this one. This short series is very interesting, not for children and very well written.
I first heard of Aim High's main actor though the Twilight Series, which I am not a fan of, and ended up very happy I watched it because of him. I have seen at least three other movies this actor was in and I always really like him. The actor who plays the main character's best friend is also a very good actor.
This show is funny, dramatic, suspenseful, fun... and though it won't make any difference in your life if you watch it or not, it is very much worth the small amount of time it takes to watch every episode. Most likely you will be begging for more. Unfortunately there isn't, but we can hope more people start realizing what a good storyline this show was and will come out with something like it soon!",1436054400,,1157,4.287671232876712
5241698,4,B0091G7A20,"Enjoyed the series, but should have read closer that these are webisodes, NOT full-sized TV episodes. So each are only 7 or 8 minutes long, including the title and credit. With only 6 or 7 episodes, there's not a lot of view time. Getting past the length, episodes are entertaining and include a bit of dark humor.",1435795200,,314,4.526315789473684
5241699,3,B0091G7A20,"Note that is a web series and very short.  When it says ""Season 1,""  it is not referring to a television season of half hour to one-hour episodes.  It's referring to webisodes that run only a few minutes each, which means the whole season is probably the length of one television show",1430265600,,284,4.423076923076923
5241700,5,B0091G7A20,Loved this and want more!,1418515200,,25,4.2
5241701,5,B0091G7A20,"I didn't know what to expect from this series when I first heard about it,  I didn't know Jackson Rathbone from anything other than Twilight (ugh bad movies) but I have to say that he truly delighted me with his portrayal of Nick Green a 16 year old DEPP wet works operative struggling to juggle high school his extra curricular activities as an assassin for the government and a social life and toward the end of S1 a burgeoning conscience. The supporting cast was wonderful his best friend/side kick (Johnny Pemberton) was wonderfully cast, the first time they met had me lol. Not to mention the relationship between the VP of the school Ockenhocker who is also his handler is just comedic gold.

The show is great and I hope that the studio releases the Second Season quickly because this show is just wonderful.",1400803200,,815,4.652777777777778
5241702,5,B0091G7A20,"Very funny and witty. Jackson Rathburn is great. Fun break from reality, this show doesn't try to be realistic fiction- just a fun show!",1389657600,,136,4.708333333333333
5241703,3,B0091G7A20,I thought that it was a real show and it is pretty good.  Each episode is only a few minutes long and if I had read carefully before I bought it I'm sure I would have known.  Good plot and action.,1381363200,,196,3.7560975609756095
5241704,5,B0091G7A20,This was enjoyable and a fun ride.  Just wish it was longer.  Hopefully the second season will have more time.,1379894400,,110,4.45

8534100,1,B0091G7A20,"Show has a lot of promise...

However, the ridiculous choice of charging the same amount for these five to ten minute episodes as for an hour long TV show is crazy.  2.99 for the whole series would be more in line.  Even then, after opening scene and credits, the whole run can't be more than about 30 minutes of total show time.",1455408000,,329,4.274193548387097

8534102,2,B0091G7A20,You get to episode 7 and it is a total different show in a different language. Also episode is only 10 minutes wtf people,1453075200,,121,4.083333333333333
