5009041,3,B006OB3JLQ,"""My name is Danijel, I'm a criminal of war."" During the Bosnian war the Serbs would go town to town and kill the men and take the women. When a Serb soldier named Danijel meets someone he once knew and is torn between his feelings for her and his duty to country. This is a very difficult movie to review. I did like this but it had a few big flaws. One of which was that it seemed to try to hard. I know that Angelina Jolie is huge into drawing attention to this type of atrocity but after awhile it was like ""I get it, it was bad, please stop showing rapes."" This is a tough movie to watch but I will say that the fighting scenes and the acting were very good. I almost feel bad not liking it (which goes back to my comment about it trying to hard), but it seemed to lack real emotion to me. Instead of letting it come naturally you are almost forced to feel bad for the girl and to me that kind of loses what I think the real point of the movie was. I do recommend it but be ready for it. Overall, a good movie but it tried way to hard to create emotion which to me hurt the movie. I give it a B-.",1331856000,11,1100,3.850220264317181
5009042,5,B006OB3JLQ,"An amazing writing/directorial debut by angelina jolie. The actor's were phenomenal(great choice in using local actors) and I applaud angelina on actually doing research and using facts in a situation which is so sensitive and which she got a lot of heat for. I applaud her for not backing down and the effects speak for themselves. A very real war movie, it doesn't baby you, if you're looking for a movie to baby you look elsewhere. It shows what these women have gone through and believe it or not I felt for both sides the muslims and the serbs maybe because I can step back and look at it objectively for what it was. The ending did shock me but I loved that it wasn't a hollywood ending, after all there are no hollywood endings in war and angelina jolie understands that. I look forward to her next directorial/writing effort, she's got the talent and we need more women in that field.",1331856000,24,892,4.512345679012346
5009043,4,B006OB3JLQ,"I wasn't sure how this would turn out. I thought I would find it only ok, a decent film from a well meaning person. I was pleasantly surprised to discover a well made, engaging, and well crafted film. The storyline, two would be lovers a la Romeo and Juliet, only they start out on the same side so to speak,  seemed hard to believe but the acting, directing, and pacing of the film makes it work. An 1hr and 40 min in I was beginning to think it should be wrapping up but that's a minor bit of criticism. If you didn't know who wrote or directed this film you would think it was from someone that has done this for years. There's a lot of strength in this film.  From the lead actors to the supporting cast , they keep you engaged. Daniel and Aja want so desperately to leave the war behind and be a safe space for each other but they can't. There's never a moment of peace, real peace, and I so respect Jolie for not making this a HW film.  I highly recommend it. It's one of  the best film I've seen  from 2011. It's a shame it didn't get as much awards love as it actually deserves.",1330473600,14,1086,4.07981220657277
5009044,5,B006OB3JLQ,"First of all I would like to thank Angelina Jolie for even picking up such a horrific topic and bringing it to the big screens, showing the world at least a little bit of what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Serbian Aggression on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This movie doesn't even begin to show what kind of despicable wartime atrocities were committed against the Bosniaks (mostly Bosnian Muslims) during the Serbian Aggression, but at least it gives a glimpse to the outside world of what happened. This movie helps to make sure no one forgets that 50 years after the Holocaust another Genocide was committed in the middle of Europe while the United Nations as well as NATO and the rest of the world were sitting in their comfortable chairs watching it happen.
There have been even worse rapes (Bosniak women and their daughters being raped in front of the eyes of their fathers / brothers / sons, Bosniak women being raped while having to watch how their fathers / sons / brothers are being slaughtered, attempts to force Bosniak men to rape their own mothers or sisters and in the end being killed for not doing so, young girls - 12 or 13 years old - being repeatedly raped by Serbs, Bosniak women jumping from the roofs or 3rd storey windows of notorious rape camps into sure death just to escape mass rapes, ca. 140 people - many of them children, even 2 days young babies - locked in houses and set on fire alive, etc. etc.). This movie doesn't even begin to show everything that happened, if it was - the movie would have been declared a triple-X-rated ""HORROR MOVIE"", but at least it shows the tip of the iceberg. It helps us to make sure the world doesn't forget what happened in the 1990's in the middle of Europe.
As for the movie itself, all I can say is that I was impressed what a great job Angelina Jolie did. It's not easy to pick up such a topic for your directorial debut, hence all I have to say is: RESPECT! Not only to her, but also to all the great actors from the Balkan, who also did the best job they could under such circumstances (most of them did actually lose family memebers during the war and lived through hell themselves).",1330214400,14,2167,4.474747474747475
5009045,4,B006OB3JLQ,"THE LAND OF BLOOD AND HONEY is stirring a lot of controversy, both bad and good.  This is actress Angelina Jolie's first outing as writer/director of a film and for many reasons she deserves applause for tackling such a subject as the Balkan War from 1992 - 1995.  Unless the viewer has studied the conditions in the once Yugoslavia, a bit of history may help the view to understand the conflict. `In 1992, conflict engulfed Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war was predominantly a territorial conflict between local Bosniaks and Croats backed by Zagreb, and Serbs backed by the Yugoslav People's Army and Serbia. The Yugoslav armed forces had disintegrated into a largely Serb-dominated military force. Opposed to the Bosnian-majority led government's agenda for independence, and along with other armed nationalist Serb militant forces, the JNA attempted to prevent Bosnian citizens from voting in the 1992 referendum on independence. This did not succeed in persuading people not to vote and instead the intimidating atmosphere combined with a Serb boycott of the vote resulted in a resounding 99% vote in support for independence. On 19 June 1992, the war in Bosnia broke out. The conflict, typified by the siege of Sarajevo and Srebrenica, was by far the bloodiest and most widely covered of the Yugoslav wars. Bosnia's Serb faction led by ultra-nationalist Radovan Karadzi' promised independence for all Serb areas of Bosnia from the majority-Bosniak government of Bosnia. To link the disjointed parts of territories populated by Serbs and areas claimed by Serbs, Karadzic pursued an agenda of systematic ethnic cleansing primarily against Bosnians through genocide and forced removal of Bosniak populations. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States reported in April 1995 that 90 percent of all the atrocities in the Yugoslav wars up to that point had been committed by Serb militants. Most of these atrocities occurred in Bosnia. In 1994 the US brokered peace between Croatian forces and the Bosnian Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the successful Flash and Storm operations, the Croatian Army and the combined Bosnian and Croat forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina, conducted an operation codenamed Operation Maestral to push back Bosnian Serb military gains. Together with NATO air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs, the successes on the ground put pressure on the Serbs to come to the negotiating table. The fighting in Croatia ended in mid-1995, after Operation Flash and Operation Storm. At the end of these operations, Croatia had managed to reclaim all of its territory except the UNPA Sector East bordering Serbia, however most of the Serbian population in these areas had become refugees, and these operations have led to war crimes indictments by the ICTY against elements of the Croat military leadership. The areas uncaptured by the Croations forces in ""Sector East"" came under UN administration (UNTAES), and were reintegrated to Croatia in 1998. The war ended with the signing of the Dayton Agreement on the 14 December 1995, with the formation of Republika Srpska as an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina being the resolution for Bosnian Serb demands.

From this background Jolie has fashioned a story that relates a strange love story that is difficult to define. Danijel (Goran Kosti') and Ajla (Zana Marjanovi'), rare in a dance hallwhen the explosive war begins Danijel is a  a Serbian policeman, becomes a captain, and Muslim artist Ajla becomes a captive. When Ajla ends up in Danijel's camp, he attempts to protect her without attracting undue attention, so she serves the men meals, but the threat of rape is ever present. Danijel's father Nebojsa (Rade erbedzija) is the general of the Serbs and discovers that his son is hiding a Muslim woman, discovers her, has her tortured, and condemns his son.  Lack of trust between the `lovers' leads to a tumultuous end.

The script is slow, the movement slower, but the impact of the bestiality of war, once again based on religion, demonstrates how cruel people can become when it is Serbs against Muslims, even when the individuals are lovers. The point is made, perhaps too repeatedly, but Jolie has assembled a fine cast and manages to give us as raw a picture of war and the camps always associated with the captured ones as can be shown on the screen.  It is a necessary subject to examine: t is not an easy film to watch. Why is it controversial?  The answer lies in why is war controversial - who 'wins' when all lose?

5009049,5,B006OB3JLQ,"I was invited to see this film back in July. At the time it was a secret screening. They wouldn't tell us the name of the movie, let alone who directed it. When I find out later it was directed by Angelina Jolie , I was impressed.

She did a great job capturing the atrocities of war and the lowest depths of humanity here.  The movie basically shows us the events leading to, during, and after the Bosnian war from the perspective of a Serb and a Bosnian who as it so happens are lovers.

The lovers are Ajla and Danijel both excellently played by Goran Kostic and Zana Marjanovic . At first Danijel is very hesitant about carrying his orders as a Serb soldier. At first, but this doesn't last long.
He either carries out or orders other members of his team to carry some barbaric actions on the Bosnian civilians they find from either rape, torture, to eventual death.

When you see what happens you are going instantly think back to the Nazi's and what they did to Jews in the name of ethnic cleansing.

Eventually, we see through Danijel's lead, genocide being committed at every turn. Ajla is captured, but she is treated like royalty (again at first) with no one else being able to touch or come near here except Danijel.

This love story though has no happy ending as Ajla sees Danijel for what he is, not an unwilling participant in the war, but an active and willing agitator in one of the most chronicled bloodbaths recorded in Europe.

""In the land of Blood and Honey"" is a superb war movie showing the type of atrocities that the Serbs were accused off while the United Nations and United States did nothing to stop it until the end.

Angelina Jolie's second directorial debut is impressive. No shot is ever wasted, every shot and scene sets up something very important. The actors are all excellent.

This could easily get several Academy nominations come Oscar time.

All in war a very brutal, but realistic depiction of another bloody war in history.",1324598400,100,1965,4.541076487252124

In defense of the movie I often read ""how this is one side of the war, how it is Angelina's own artistic freedom."" And I say fine. Artists do have that right. But it would be like if someone made a movie about the American Civil war and not showing the suffering of the Americans living in the south and only focusing on the north and their suffering, and also completely leaving out the suffering of the African Americans as if they didn't exist in the US. On top of it have actors act in ways that are just not Balkan mannerisms and cultural etiquette. Imagine if in the above American civil war movie, all the actors act in Japanese style.

And that might be why Ukraine is the way it is right now.

The Serbs are depicted in this movie as behaving like Nazis including defenestration of babies, organized raping of women and the main Serbian has dirty blonde hair and deep-set blue eyes while his Muslim girlfriend has big dark eyes and curly black hair so the echo is definitive.

Why didn't the Muslim female ask the Serbian male why he dated her before the war if he had been raised to be against them?  Maybe just possessing that question would have spared her illusions and a prolonged experience:  ""Your father, your father!"" - more likely the son as well.

The Military Channel presented the controversial nature of the role of the Mufti during World War II as follows: ""At what point does the desire to support your people become unacceptable?

5009112,3,B006OB3JLQ,"Written, directed and co-produced by Angelina Jolie, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" is a romance set against the Bosnian War. Her directorial debut deals with such serious issues as sexual violence during the war, a topic addressed also in films like ""Grbavica: the Land of My Dreams"" in 2006, but somehow Jolie as filmmaker decided that the film needs a love story.

The film's love story centers on Danijel (Goran Kostic), a son of a strict Serbian general, and Ajla (Zana Marjanovic), a Muslim painter. The war begins and the ex-lovers meet each other again at a prisoner camp, one as commander, the other as prisoner.

I am no expert on weaponry and artillery, so I have nothing to say about the accuracies or inaccuracies of the uniforms and weapons. Some may take issue on the film's political leanings, which I will not discuss here, either.

My main complaint is about the uneven narrative style that wavers uncomfortably between grim and sentimental. While Jolie and photographer Dean Semler (""Dances with Wolves"") successfully creates the oppressive atmosphere of the war-torn country, the serious message of the film is underdmined by the thin and underdeveloped love story.

Though clearly made with all good intention, ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" needs more credible character developments and skilled storytelling.",1376956800,5,1335,5.082191780821918

This movie lacks the historical, ethical and moral perspective and responsibility. Faking the compassion, the knowledge about the subject matter and the artistc medium itself, naturally results in a disaster.

5009115,3,B006OB3JLQ,"Many have been comparing this film with some sort of modern day Romeo and Juliet story.  Set in Balkans, during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992, this film describes complicated intimate relationship between Serb military man who becomes officer in a civil war and his lover who is a muslim woman and an artist (painter).  They start their relationship before the war and circumstances bring them togehter once the war start when a young woman is brought into (Serb) soldiers' camp that uses women in many ways: they are servants who cook, wash, clean and serve food, but they are also sex slaves or subjects to sexual humiliations and beatings.

There are several issues I have with the film.  First of all, there is no such thing as Bosnian nation. In Bosnia three major ethnic groups used to live together: Serbs, Croats and Muslims (I am not even mentioning minorities such as Roma, Jews and other ethnic groups).  All these ethnic groups are Bosnians because they lived in region of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  They share the same language and culture, except that their religion is different.  They are Orthodox Christians, Catholic Christians, Jews and Muslims, not to mention athests (i.e. hard core Communsts over there who do not believe in existance on any kind of God).  Over the centuries, many have intermarried, but traditionally - in that partof the world, each person would assume ""nationality"" of their father.  That is the entire tragedy of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia that all (three) major ethnic groups were actively taking apart of.  But let's go back to this movie.

To me personally, this film is more about power and control that one person (usually the one on the ""winning"" side of the war) have over another.  It is also a sort of relationship that is forbidden not only because of lovers' ethnic differences but also because of the fact that they have a sort of ""slave/master"" relationship. In normal circusmances, this type of relationship does not have to be mutually exclusive.  It is typically carried on in private, intimate relation beteen two people who trust each other implicitly.  When bond is strong no other person, or situation can come between them.  But this type of relationship in war circumstances is extreme.  There is war and differnet people have different driving force in tough times like that.  Even family relationships come to extremes that in casual dominant/submissive relationship is typically not so relevant.  Two lovers in this film have commitments not only to each other, but also to their families (father/sister) respectively.  It is no small matter since we are speaking of life and death and even small children are not spared.  In war, all is fair and everyone is a fair game.

If one removes politics, local and international conflicts and level sets this story in context of two adult people, fairly well educated, who deeply care about each other but have to make choices based on rules of war, then story is no longer a story about (dominant/submissive) love; but rather a story about survival.  It becomes a chess game where only one person can survive, but even that does not lead that individual to victory, or happiness or fulfillment.  In extreme circumsatnces like this one, everyone loses.  The only way these lovers could preserve their devotion to each other is by removing themselves completely from all of their surrounds and starting over in a place where they know no one and no one knows them.  As far as I see it, this is a deep as this movie goes.

It is Angelina Jolie's directorial debit and she also wrote a screenplay for this film.  I can understand her wanting to include international aspect of it, because after all she is UNICEF ambassador has has strong personal interest in international affairs. But he superficial approach to the war in Bosnia (and Balkans in general) makes this film less believable and weak.  As a director, from the artistic point of view, she needs to find a strong mentor.  There is a lot she needs to learn about directing and the other side of the camera.",1369785600,2,4085,4.845821325648415

5009132,4,B006OB3JLQ,"This was a very well done movie. It was well written and directed. The acting was superb. It is extremely visceral and moving (almost too much) and it deals with an important topic. The movie, of course, is a love story (of sorts) set against the backdrop of the war in Bosnia. It follows a Muslim woman and a Serbian soldier and tells the story of the conflict from the ground, or from the perspective of people who actually lived through it. Telling the story from the ground allows the full emotional impact of the conflict to hit home (though it has its drawbacks as well). The characters in the movie are realistic, and their actions all seem to make sense from the standpoint of their characters.

I have to qualify my praise, however, for two reasons. First, the movie is very difficult to get through. I have watched other movies that deal with similar themes (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hotel-Rwanda/dp/B0007R4T3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hotel Rwanda</a>), I have read books about the breakup of Yugoslavia, the holocaust, the Russian Revolution and Civil War, etc.. I am always deeply effected when I read about, or see on screen, the violence that humans perpetrate against each other, but I rarely have trouble finishing a movie (or a book) like this. This movie was different. I had to stop the movie about forty-five minutes in, and I was not sure if I was going to be able to finish it. This movie is not necessarily more violent than other movies (or books), and a lot of the worst violence takes place off screen (for which I was thankful), but this movie personalizes the violence, and portrays the emotional toll of the violence, in a really devastating way. I understand Angelina Jolie's desire to portray the atrocities that took place during the Bosnian war (particularly against women) but one has to walk a fine line when portraying this kind of violence. It would be dishonest to sugarcoat it, but it does no good (in my opinion) to beat the audience into a state of hopelessness and despair. The audience can only take so much at a time without becoming emotionally exhausted. I did decide to stick with the movie, and I am glad I did (the second half was a little bit easier to take), but it was touch and go there for awhile.

The second reason I am slightly hesitant with my praise is that the movie seemed to me to provide more heat than light (more anger than understanding). Anger can be a positive force for change at times, but it can also be a very destructive force. I also tend to think that the anger generated from a film like this tends to dissipate fairly quickly. Understanding, on the other hand, lasts forever. In other words, if you succeed in getting people angry about the kinds of violence portrayed in this film, this will usually last a day or two and then dissipate. If, on the other hand, you provide people with greater understanding, that is something they will carry with them for the rest of their lives.

This movie certainly succeeds in making the viewer angry about the violence that was committed during the Bosnian war (particularly the violence against women), but I do not really feel like I understand the Bosnian conflict much better than I did before I watched the movie. For example, we can ask a simple question: why did the Serbs invade Bosnia-Herzegovina to begin with? We do not really get an answer to that question within the film. We also do not learn a whole lot about the historical context that gave rise to these events. There are hints here and there (like when the Serbian general describes how his family was shot) but it is not really filled out enough. There is a point where one of the Serb soldiers says ""We are fighting this war so that our children will not have to go to war."" That is a very interesting perspective, but the film does not succeed in making it an intelligible perspective. It is impossible to understand, from the film alone, why any of the Serbs would believe that.

So while I thought that the movie was a very well done movie, I wish there was a little more light. While I am by no means an expert on the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing conflicts I thought I would provide a list of a few books I have found helpful in shedding light on various aspects of the conflicts for those who would like a little more light. In full disclosure, I should say that I have not read all of these books from cover to cover. I started a number of them over the summer, and when school started back up again, I had to put them on hold, but I have read enough from each of them to feel comfortable recommending them. I will be updating this list as I read more.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Vengeance/dp/0393335488/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood & Vengeance</a>&nbsp;by Chuck Sudetic tells the story of the Bosnian conflict from the standpoint of a Muslim family.

5009134,4,B006OB3JLQ,"I did like the movie. It is a conflict that I know much about so I could relate to it. History was not kind to this region. The Bosnian Muslims and Serbs had lived together for centuries. Recently under Tito for many years under a forced peace. When Tito died, the Serbs, firstly, tried to keep Yugoslavia together when that failed tried to secure themselves the biggest part. Not that everyone else was that innocent either in this grab for power.

Suddenly, the Bosnian Muslims were remembered not as neighbors and friends but as richer landlords almost 100 years ago. More importantly during ww2 while the Serbs suffered extremely badly from the Nazis, the Bosnian Muslims were remembered as Nazi allies as many of them had in WW2 aligned with the Nazis. They were seen as enemies of the Serbs even though many had aligned with the anti Nazis. Suddenly young people not even born in this conflict are blamed for what happened. It did not, however take much for the hatred to fan out and for a comparative well-armed and prepared Serbian army to commit a series of atrocities in the regions. This is the story of one such place. It was well put together.

I thought the acting reasonable. I did like, in particular, Rade Serbedzija performance. I thought he made a very interesting character.

Worth seeing",1344729600,3,1308,4.703056768558952
5009135,2,B006OB3JLQ,"Angelina Jolie deserves some respect for choosing the Bosnian conflict as the subject of her directorial debut considering she could have easily settled for safer, more mainstream material, but as a writer/director she still has a long way to go and ""In The Land Of Blood And Honey"" stands as a heartfelt movie watered down by recycled melodrama. The sectarian conflicts which erupted after the shattering of Yugoslavia were already explored with greater power in the 1990s in films like ""Savior"" by Predrag Antonijevic and Milcho Manchevski's ""Before The Rain,"" while those movies told strong stories with powerful cultural messages, Jolie's movie simply shows us the horrors of the conflict as background for a standard soap opera.

The film's storyline centers on a Muslim woman named Ajila (Zana Marjanovic) whose community is overrun by Christian militias led by Danijel (Goran Kostic). Eight months earlier they had already met at a cafe where a romantic dance floor moment was interrupted by the first bombs of the war. As soldiers go around looting and raping, Ajila finds herself taken captive with a group of women to a nearby base where Danijel decides to give her careful protection, this puts him at risk because his warlord father Nebojsa (Rade Serbedzija) is determined to wipe out all Muslims in a storm of ethnic hatred.

""In The Land Of Blood And Honey"" proves Jolie has an eye for capturing memorable images and establishing a place, she knows how to use her camera. She also doesn't flinch away from the horrors of war and provides up close moments of terror and heartbreaking violence, with unflinching honesty she shows how rape is used as a weapon in conflict zones. But Jolie's canvas remains dry, she SHOWS us the horror of the Bosnian war but never digs deep enough into her characters, their backgrounds and the dimensions of their experiences. It's as if the war's grisly details are presented in the style of a high school essay and the characters are no more than vessels for Jolie's overall, general idealization of love surpassing ethnic boundaries (although the ending might seems to leave hope behind). We know what Jolie WANTS to say (the message itself is admirable) but she fumbles in the delivery. For example Ajila and Danijel never have a conversation that feels real, they never have a moment where you really sense or feel the soul-twisting political/religious/social dilemmas they now face, they simply lock up in a room, have intense sex and move along to the basic schemes of a potboiler. Some scenes seem to end abruptly when they should be allowed to play out more, some transitions feel like leaps, leaving confusing or sometimes vague plot holes in the story. The love story itself doesn't develop with a convincing rhythm or sense of real emotional growth.

The conflict in the former Yugoslavia is indeed an important event in recent world history, the kind of violence and sectarian terror unleashed there can be seen recycled in a place like Syria today. But of course most Americans have no idea about the events depicted in the film or could care less, so in that sense Jolie's bravery should be commended. But she also suffers from the kind of typical, postmodern attitude dominant in the arts these days except for a few veterans like Oliver Stone. Basically her film laments at how awful the Bosnian war was and has a general critique here of religious division lines, but these ideas have been expressed much better in other films, here she has little to really SAY about the whole history of the region and the conflict. It's as if Jolie wants to play that typical game of exploring a political issue without being political. A few characters say a few lines about Communism's collapse and how it opened the door to sectarian divisions (under Tito ethnic and religious differences were rightfully cast aside as official state policy), but Jolie's views are somewhat vague, she's obviously against war in general, but she never presents any sort of bold political stance. The UN, NATO are almost cartoonish background characters. Maybe it just isn't fashionable in these times to clearly make a political statement.

While this film isn't a complete success, it still announces Angelina Jolie as a director with promise, maybe her next effort will be more focused and tighter. It's refreshing to see a celebrity of her calibre with historical, geopolitical interests and it would be a shame to see her fall back into ""mainstream"" genre filmmaking (like Kenneth Branagh with ""Thor"").

I didn't even know this went on which shows how much of a bubble I live in, but now it's had me investigate this in a deeper way.  I guess she's changed one person's perception then she did her job.  Great movie as I said, but it's no a happy movie.  It does give you a glimpse into real life and not Hollywood fantasy.",1343001600,2,791,4.342465753424658

5009138,5,B006OB3JLQ,"To Angelina Jolie:
You are a great artist!
Your greatness is in writing and directing such a thoughtful, beautiful and visceral movie, which is also a condemnation of war and a celebration of love. After the first viewing of the movie, I immediately viewed it again, and then I replayed the ending--a perfectly fitting, truthful, and unsentimental ending.
The inner struggles of the protagonists for dignity and integrity are spirited and moving and bring into sharp relief the atrocities of war. The beginning scene, before the war starts, is just lovely in its innocence and playfulness--all lost in the war. Every detail in every scene is meticulously thought through and poetically expressed. The actors you have chosen are truly accomplished and sensitive, as a leaf in the wind, to different emotional undercurrents. From start to finish, they are convincing in their passion and in their vulnerability. It is a story as old as Romeo and Juliet but also new in its portrayal of intense ethnic hate that has become the hall mark of the 20th century. Your interweaving of the personal and national themes is remarkable and heart-wrenching at every turn.
One more thing: at first I thought that the English language spoken in the movie (rather than the local language) would impede the movie's credibility, but it didn't. The plot and the characters are so convincing, and the dialogue so terse and poignant, that the language becomes a universal language of love and war--the eternal subjects of art.
Your movie is searing and unforgettable.
Bravo!",1340668800,3,1552,5.06640625

The ""reality"" I saw in the movie was harsh and, I am sure, not even close to the actual reality of living it. The crimes against humanity are too vast to even comprehend.

I recall reading and watching the media about the atrocities Serbs inflicted on Bosnian as a sophmore student in  my college years. The slaughter of Bosnians were as great as the Somalians and Rwandans. As always the greatest victims of casualty of  any war are women and children. Some were starved to death, some were beaten to death, and some were shot to death. Raping of women over and over by hundreds of men was even worse than the killing of other victims. Women were left to die slowly, the others died instantly. The question is why would world watched these atrocities to go on for over 3 years? The atrocities done in the heart of Europe, and no Europian Nation attempt to stop them. The Bosnians were in the verge becoming extinct and no intervention. Where were the advocate of liberty, and human rights? In 1988 Kurds in Iraq(During the Saddam Administration,who was U.S. allies at the time) were gased, no one said anything, but when same dictator tried to get the piece of Kuwait, whose oil reserve was concern to U.S. and England. Saddam(All of the sudden he(Saddam) is enemy, because he had stepped on the interest of great powers) was stopped, because the great powers were concerned that Saudi oil would be in jepordy, which would not be in the interest of fuel dependent nations. Angelina Julie has done great job of bringing the brutality of Serbians to the screen.

So much tought was put into how to make the Serbs look as much as monsters as it can possibly be, that you, misses Jolie, forgot that acting is what makes a movie believeble. And why not spend more time developing the characters and show their inner war in all that madness, if this was a story about love in a time of war. But no, this movie was made with one purpose only.
What pains me the most is that 95% of the viewers will learn about history trough movies like these... I'm sure that events presented in the movie did in fact happen, but when you don't show what the other side did, are you really presenting the truth, if that was you goal, or was it?",1336780800,11,695,4.117647058823529

5009152,5,B006OB3JLQ,"""In the Land of Blood and Honey"" provides a multidimensional perspective on the Bosnian War (1992-1995). The main belligerents were the attacking forces of the Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat military units that were trying to establish full control of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The victims were Bosnian Muslims. The film provides an excellent insight into the war itself. It is a love story within the context of violent opposing ethnic divisions where love becomes a victim of deeply imbued prejudice. The film might be evaluated from several points of view. First, the film was produced from a female perspective, but it certainly would not be classified as a ""chick flick."" Second, the film was produced from the perspective of the Muslims and depicted the Serbs as controlling aggressors--providing a propaganda dimension. Third, the film shows how deeply stereotypes are embedded in our unconscious minds and how they manifest themselves in vindictive behavior. Fourth, the film emphasizes one of the aggressor's objectives in the conflict--ethnic cleansing through purposeful sex. If viewed from those perspectives, the film is a welcome addition to films that depict war and the exercise of political power through military effort.",1336435200,4,1236,5.409326424870466
5009153,1,B006OB3JLQ,"For a film allegedly depicting the horrors of war, or some thereof, this is oddly dispassionate. Yes, war is hell. Yes, people suffer in war. Yes, rape and other cruelties abound. We get the point. But that point was made, and far more chillingly than Jolie's offering, by dramatists centuries ago. They didn't feel the need display front and center stage a child pitched off city battlements, a man's eyes gouged out, a girl's hands and tongue lopped off after she has been raped; that such incidents take place off stage doesn't diminish the horror one bit. Jolie doesn't seem to understand that less is more.

Additionally, apart from Jolie's fascination with horrific brutality, she also fails to understand that one of the reasons these dramatic episodes have resonated with viewers for centuries is because the characters are delineated so skilfully that one cares for them. The same can't be said for Jolie's characters, who are as deep as cardboard and unreal. Place the plot into another context; say, Kampuchea under Pol Pot, Rwanda, Sobibor or Auschwitz-Birkenau. Does it work? Not quite. Nor does it work here.

I'm sorry I wasted my time on this schlock job.

5009155,4,B006OB3JLQ,"Positives:
I applaud the courage to take on the multiple tasks of producer, writer and director for a project that also has great humanitarian value. It's a challenge to objectively portray a conflict between three groups that is fueled largely by religion, ethnicity, history and territory.  Though largely concerned with the treatment of Muslim Bosnian women and viewed from their pov there were some acknowledgements as to how the Orthodox Christina Serbs justified their part in the conflict. Nice to see some authenticity in location and actor selection.

Negatives:
Two noticeable deficiencies concerning the DVD special features. First, I would have liked to have seen Ms. Jolie's source material in writing a ""true events"" movie of this importance. Second, I would have liked to have seen an academic style panel discussion included. Yes, one can always find this on their own but it has more import if included with the movie. Both give some insight into Ms. Jolie's thought processes on the topic and the movie.

Jolie drew upon her experiences as UN ambassador for inspiration, and I am willing to acknowledge her ambition in the project, even if parts of the story were stretched too thin, the film marked a confidant debut for her. Filmed overseas with local actors from the surrounding regions, it's not the glamorous Hollywood fare normally associated with Jolie's acting roles, but it's an intriguing film, if only to see what potential Jolie might possess as a filmmaker.",1332806400,3,914,4.828025477707007

I must say that this movie was magnificent; I was shockingly surprised at how good Miss Angelina directed this and brought so much life to this story.  She goes back in time and touches a topic, a subject that many are or were scared to do, she did something so brave--she lit the truth on fire. Yes, things in the movie have happened in Bosnia, while outsiders watched and did nothing. This was not something that lasted few months, this has lasted for over three years and yet people did nothing to help the innocent, oh surely blood did splatter on honey.  The question surrounding this topic is why not? Did the people of the world view them as less human, did religion play a part of this decision, we will never know, but we will be left wondering as to why no one had stepped in for a long time. Can you imagine being raped for months, painfully by hundreds of men, while the world just shrugged their shoulders? How would it feel if the world only saw you as ""nothing"", not important at all to be saved even when you cried nonstop and screamed the loudest? Why did the children have to killed, what did they do, but years went on as many were killed, painfully, throats slashed, while at times mothers had to watch. How could anyone not understand this evil, how could anyone not understand their pain, how could anyone did not want to lend a hand? This movie will leave you with questions, but it also lets you understand as to things that happened. Don't let anyone tell you, don't let anyone fool you, here or anywhere, that this has never happened, it did. This movie is very dark and will leave you with moments of sadness, moments of tears, moments of your heart racing, and moments when your lungs can not open anymore, do to what you see in front of your screen, but it is ok, continue, and learn what happened. Overall, I suggest that everyone with a heart watch this, because you will learn a thing or two about yourself, after watching you will be a different person.",1332720000,6,2166,4.4260651629072685

8501811,2,B006OB3JLQ,"I had to debate giving this two or three stars, adding that third for effort.  I decided on two because so much of this story just seem contrived, specifically the character construction.  A Serb and a Bosniak happen to be lovers, just happen to end up on the opposite sides of the same camp wire, and the Serb heavy is forced to assert his Serbhood upon her.  Aside from the gratuitous ""war porn,"" as some have called it, I settled on two because of its implication that NATO ""humanitarian interventions"" are the magic bullets needed to end such war crimes.

And yes, war crimes were committed abundantly in the broken Yugoslavia.  But a major issue is why Yugoslavia was allowed - nay, encouraged - to break apart by the same Western powers that wrung their hands over the ensuing atrocities.  This was a classic case of Great Power hubris, an unwillingness to face up to the probable consequences of self-serving ""good intentions.""  For anyone who knew Yugoslavia also knew this was the likely result if the federal state were allowed to dissolve, especially in its mixed regions.  Funny how that was nicely skirted in all the film's wordy historical reconstructions.

And perhaps the major problem is with ""humanitarian intervention"" itself.  It's assumed this will always be done by Western powers, who seem to have special divine right to intercede above the complexities of Westphalian international law.  But what if that right is not the special property of said powers?  One thinks of the death squad regimes the US was propping up in Latin America a mere decade before the events in Bosnia.  What if Cuba and the USSR, gazing upon the flowing blood of El Salvador and Guatemala, had organized an army of international intervention to stop these mass atrocities?  I guarantee their motives would have been impugned from the get-go: who are *they* to pose as noble saviors in humanitarian catastrophes?  Well, who then were the Western Powers to do so, France and the US especially, after spending 20 years destroying the land and people of Indochina?  Only when one's swept the body counts that led to My Lai under the dirt, does the West seem pure enough to slip into the crusading armor of knightly rectitude.

Actually, a Soviet Bloc state did engage in one piece of humanitarian intervention: Vietnam in Kampuchea, in 1979.  That this was not credited as such, but presented as mere regional power playing, should give fair warning about the intentions here.  So what should be done - let the scenes depicted just play themselves out to the last bitter drop?  Perhaps the best thing is to head them off beforehand; for the rich and powerful to realize the full range of consequences prior to dictating the lives of the little people of the earth.  Having one's cake and eating it too is a fantasy of Western elites, from Hollywood to Wall Street to Washington, gated off from the real world they rule.",1510876800,,2915,4.801603206412826

I decided to see if this movie had anything sensitive or compassionate to say about that horrible time. However, within the first 10 minutes it became clear that it was just more anti-Serb propaganda. Many of Hollywood's films play this role of reinforcing the US government's propaganda in anything relating to foreign countries where we have been active in wars. They do it year after year, generation after generation. The propaganda serves to remind new generations about things that they weren't around to hear about when it happened, while during the time it happened, the media only ever told a skewed side of the story to the previous generation. The older I get, the more I am convinced that Hollywood is an arm of the deep state and its purpose is to continue the narrative that the Orwellian rulers want you to believe, but it's never unbiased. Hollywood's ""historical"" films are usually full of lies, which sadly 99% of the population will accept without ever doing any of the their own research into the other side of the story. If you want to understand what this country is and was about, watch films from the former Yugoslavia from before 1992 and even during the early 1990s when the wars had started and you will get a better sense of what was happening. The only movies that have been funded after that in the former Yugoslavia are ones with a definite bias and contain an objective to indoctrinate- I feel sorry for the actors who have to make a living and therefore have to accept these kinds of roles.
