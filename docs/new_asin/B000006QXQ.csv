8561904,5,B000006QXQ,"I frequently show this video to my art survey class because it does a brilliant job of explaining the origins of the christian catacombs in Rome. It also takes a look at the Jewish burial sites and then takes a short trip to the catacombs located in Alexandria. Email me for a transcript that I made of this wonderful video.

8561905,4,B000006QXQ,"Because there are over sixty miles of catacombs beneath Rome!  This interesting program takes you to these mysterious underground places.  You will see how they were made, how the bodies were ""stored,"" and many examples of the famous artwork that can be found in them.  Although the catacombs were largely used by the early Christians, there is even a visit to a Jewish catacomb as well!

Four stars.  Short but informative.",1105056000,,424,4.915492957746479
