If you're not a fan, then you don't like action movies or you don't know Jackie Chan movies well enough. What I like about Jackie Chan movies is that all the fight scenes are engineered by him in a very creative way, but it seems very natural. Notice that most fighting scenes nowadays have shots that last less then 1 sec, but in Jackie's movies they last MUCH longer and don't seem fake like in Bruce Lees movies or most action movies. Of course, no one could fight like that in real life but it seems like its possible, especially due to the little cuts in between the scenes. Jackie should receive much more credit then what he has, but he was unfortunate to enter the American movies industry late because his talent would have been best boosted nowadays with all the modern equipment and cinema knowledge. Instead, he wasted a great deal of potential while doing movies in the 70s and early 80s in the Chinese movie industry, which was only beginning to develop and people had no clue how to do movies. However, these two movies are very good despite being Chinese, but it's in a period where the Chinese learned how to do movies better by absorbing American techniques. Buy it, it's worth it! One of his best movies!",1326326400,,1297,4.5
