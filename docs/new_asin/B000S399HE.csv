8204216,1,B000S399HE,"So boring....no meaningful resolution to anything in this film. Lurking paranoia seems to dominate the lead, but it is unexplained. A lot of drinking and meaningless living. Not sure why anyone needs to watch this kind of film--no message, no appeal, no joy, just desperation. Do not waste your time. I used to live in England. This is not out of character for English cinema, but it cannot redeem it self in my mind.",1507334400,,417,4.648648648648648
8204217,5,B000S399HE,Character driven indie film. A young Tobias Menzies and Aiden Gillen are great.,1473033600,2,79,5.153846153846154
8204218,3,B000S399HE,"I love this movie. It' s one of my favorite movies starring Aidan Gillen. I was hesitant to purchase being that I'm from the United States and there's warning about the DVD not playing in our DVD players.  The DVD did not work in my XBOX, not in a portable DVD player , but it did work in the new PlayStation 4",1466985600,3,310,4.0
8204219,3,B000S399HE,"The quality of production on this film is top-notch. The acting is also good to above-average. The primary issue I had with this film is that it's boring. It wouldn't be accurate to say that it's about nothing, but perhaps it would be accurate to say it's about nothing I can muster enough feeling to care about. To borrow a popular phrase from a few years ago; it's about WPP (white people's problems). They've got food, shelter, and steady work, so of course they fret over their personal relationships and feel depressed because they aren't completely fulfilled by their work.

So many British films fail because they never allow their characters to climb out of their misery and pain and enjoy a few brief moments of happiness, this film swings the pendulum of happiness too far the other way, and expects us to care that a few relatively privileged men and woman aren't exactly living their dreams by their late twenties.

I was left wondering what the talented people that made this film might be able to do if they'd had a script that was actually about something that mattered.",1409356800,3,1085,4.705263157894737
