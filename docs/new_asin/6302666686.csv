8585386,2,6302666686,"Sunset Grill  Nude scenes from three different women: Lori Singer, Alexandra Paul, Sandra Wild. All three actresses got naked, but in the case of Paul and Singer, the scenes were cut tastefully to avoid pubic exposure. In fact, Singer got up from one energetic love scene where the lovers were obviously in the later stages of intercourse, the director cut away too slowly, and you could see that she was wearing a thong!
As for the movie, well, let me tell you. In the Olympics they won't let a 150 pound man wrestle against a 170 pound man because it just isn't a fair match. But in the movies, one drunken stumblebum private eye armed with a BB gun can overcome all of the following:
1. Several corrupt INS officials
2. The Mexican border federales.
3. The world's richest man and several doctors, who are running a scam to use illegal immigrants as unwilling heart and liver donors.
4. The world's richest man's connections, which ""go so high up the ladder God can't see the top""
5. Thugs who look like a cross between Dolph Lundgren and Andre the Giant, and are better armed than the Iraqi army.
6. Treacherous girlfriends.
7. Incompetent associates.
8. Sarcastic bartenders.
Very realistic movie.
Stacy Keach plays, or maybe I should say overplays, the world's richest man, and he says that ripping hearts out of living victims is OK because:
* They are doing it for a good cause, to give the gift of life to senior members of the Republican Party and other equally important members of society.
* The Aztecs did it, and these victims are descended from the Aztecs, so they are culturally prepared for it.
OK, fair enough. I was having some problem with it, but then when he explained the Aztec thing, I could relate to it.",970358400,12,1729,4.613636363636363
