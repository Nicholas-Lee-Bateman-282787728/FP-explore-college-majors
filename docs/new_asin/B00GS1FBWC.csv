8626585,5,B00GS1FBWC,"If you are really into skeet shooting or are relatively experienced, this DVD might be worth watching. For me, he expanded on certain topics beyond his basic DVD, that proved very helpful, especially on eye dominance, look points, eye control and to recognize problems along with solutions. I would recommend viewing his updated basic skeet DVD ""Todd Benders Championship Skeet"" first if you are a beginner. After watching this just for the first time, it helped me gain greater consistency the very next day.",1389225600,,509,5.071428571428571
