8383671,1,B002XH98W4,"I would not recommend this video.  There is no exercise involved.  All of the flirtations involve only a chair.  If you think this would help you get ideas to dance infront of another person who is seated on a chair, you'd be wrong.  This is what I thought, but this video does not address this desire.",1402185600,,302,4.339285714285714
8383672,4,B002XH98W4,I really like this workout. It's easy to follow and quick to learn. I bought this to learn a little one thing to spice of the love life and this is definitely doing a good job for me!!,1366329600,2,184,3.8684210526315788
8383673,1,B002XH98W4,"In spite of knowing what ""chair dance"" meant....this was a little too much for my girlfriends and I.  Leave it to the professionals.",1365638400,,132,4.739130434782608
8383674,1,B002XH98W4,"I got sucked into flirty girl fitness videos from an infomercial. Ordered one and then they kept sending me a new one every month even though I kept trying to cancel. So I got stuck with 10 videos. Since I couldn't return them, decided to make the best of it and begin exercising again. There are a few of the toning videos ""body blast"" and ""abs & booty"" that are good, bvut if you do order them, purchase them through Amazon instead of flirty girls website, otherwise they will keep sending you things you do not want.

Now on to this video. My first complaint with this (and most of thier dance videos) is that there is no warm up. The video starts with "" Now that you're all warmed up, lets begin the routine"" type of set-up. The first time I was like ""huh"". I was dressed and ready to work out and realizing I had to turn off the video and figure out how to do my own warm-up. By the time I did this, I had no desire to do the video that day. The next day I was prepared for it but a little nervous because I wasn't sure how to properly warm-up for this particular routine. Once upon a time, I used to dance, I don't remember my old warm ups, but I know the purpose of a warm up is not just to get you energized and pumped for your workout but to prepare and warm up the various muscle groups you will be using and get all your flexible parts warmed up to prevent injury. If your a beginner, you won't know how to do this and can get hurt.

2nd complaint: No cool down or stretch after. Again, unless your a dancer or familiar to working out, how are you supposed to know how to properly do this. Not cooling down or stretching after can also lead to injuries.

3rd: they go through the routine too quickly. Unless you are an experienced dancer, it is really difficult to keep up. She teaches too fast and doesn't go through it slow enough times before she speeds it up and is on to the next set of moves.

4th: she doesn't teach the routine in counts. As someone who used to dance but hasn't in years (and I did teach), teaching moves with a count is important to help students learn not only the moves but how fast or slow to go. The parts of the routine I did pick up I was doing too fast or too slow in places because I didn't understand the counts.

5th: these videos are about sexy dance routines, but if your not used to dancing sexy you're not going to understand how to move your hips in a certain way and they don't show you.

This video is not really a workout video, it is more about learning a specific dance routine. Now if you can keep up, doing any form of dance will give you a workout. But unless you are already an experienced dancer, you probably won't be able to follow along enough to get a decent workout and may injure yourself in the process.

Don't waste your money on this one.",1362960000,5,2808,4.122486288848263
8383675,3,B002XH98W4,"I bought this for my mom, I know right? She wanted it for Christmas. She has lost a little weight but the only aggravation is that I have to teach her how to use the DVD player every time she wants to use it. I have never used this product so I can not completely say what I think, everyone should try to exercise everyday even when it's 24 degrees outside.",1357084800,,357,4.042253521126761
8383676,5,B002XH98W4,"I recommend this product for someone who it looking for a little exercise and a little sexy-self time.  I only had the problem of having the right size chair to use for the workout.  They were either too tall, too wide, or too heavy.  But, the workout was fun!",1349481600,3,260,4.26530612244898
8383677,5,B002XH98W4,"WOW! I love this DVD. Tried it for the first time today when my husband was asleep.  I got a good workout and some great moves that he would love as well.  Can't wait until tomorrow to practice ... sorry ... lol I mean work out some more. Oh well, I am on the hunt for more as the sessions were long, but way too short for me because I had too much fun.  Caution ... you will need a sturdy chair as I need to replace the one from this morning, it was a bit on the weak side, but I didn't expect to be practicing / working out for 3 hours .... hee hee.

Day 2: I am feeling the effects, back, legs, abs and shoulders are all sore this morning.",1335312000,3,642,3.8045112781954886
8383678,1,B002XH98W4,this was not what i expected i was looking forward to burning calories and having fun working out i do not really  consider this a good work out  and it doesn't make you sweat as much as you want to.,1311984000,2,199,3.95
