2647968,5,B000HXDM9Q,"This is a very good video. The quality is very good and so were the camera angles. Being a USA soccer fan, I was happy to see good coverage of the games agains Czech, Italy, and Ghana. Included is Clint Dempsey's lone goal (vs. Ghana). It also shows the goals Ghana scored against the U.S. and shows the injury to Claudio Reina as well as the fowl that Onyewu supposedly committed. But after watching this dvd, he (Onyewu) did not foul the Ghanian player.

 The only part I didn't like is that you have to fast-forward to each group's play highlights. I have not been able to find out how to go directly to a certain group in the first stage which was kind of frustrating.

 Otherwise this dvd is very good. I highly recommend it.",1178582400,,730,4.345588235294118
2647969,4,B000HXDM9Q,This video is best taken in small doses.  The goals and shots are excellent but they all start to fade together.,1171670400,,112,4.333333333333333

2647972,4,B000HXDM9Q,"All the goals from 2006 World Cup are included on this DVD, but only a few of the penalty kicks shootouts are included. Very good quality picture, a must see for any soccer fan.",1168300800,3,177,4.235294117647059
2647973,5,B000HXDM9Q,"This DVD provided excellent videos of the 2006 World Cup from Germany.  As the title states, it included all of the goals of the tournament.  The play-by-ply commentary is easy to follow.  The video quality is excellent.",1167868800,,220,4.891891891891892
2647974,1,B000HXDM9Q,"I found this DVD to be extremely disappointing, especially when compared to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Highilights DVD by Reedswain (and I don't think Reedswain has produced one for the 2006 WC).  If you want to see a bunch of goals, one right after the other, then perhaps you'll enjoy it.  However, I think this DVD utterly and completely fails to capture the excitement, anticipation, electric atmosphere, and beauty of the tournament.  To me, it was a passion-less production.

There is little to no pre-match analysis/introduction of the games being played, or its star players; there is no break in between the goals from one game to the next; and there are no highlights other than goals. I know, that's why it's called ""All the Goals"", but without other meaningful highlights, the goals are seen out of context and are almost meaningless.  For instance, how can you not show Zidane's infamous headbutt on Materazzi in the final, and how it affected the game?  This DVD doesn't.  And what about the drama of Australia scoring 3 goals in the remaining 10 minutes against Japan, after Japan had been leading 1-0 the entire game?  This DVD captures none of that drama.

If you just want to see all the goals of WC 2006, you can do it for free at the FIFA WC website.  They even show some great highlights as well, but there's no commentary.  And no, I am not affiliated with FIFA in any way, shape, or form.",1167609600,11,1408,4.614457831325301
2647975,5,B000HXDM9Q,"This DVD Rocks, it contains all the goals of the 2006 WORLD CUP And The Way its Done, Its Really A Highlight Film Of The Whole Tournament. It was a great world cup and thankfully France did not win and even better ITALY WON. The extras are the top 10 goals and the top ten saves. This is an exciting must have for world cup fans.",1159833600,15,329,4.0

8142213,1,B000HXDM9Q,"Same here, didn't work. It's not region free as the back of the box says. My SONY BD player failed to read this after struggling for few seconds. So, basically it's a zero star, not one!",1348185600,,186,4.194444444444445
8142214,5,B000HXDM9Q,"After every World Cup since France 1998, I eagerly anticipate the release of this type of video. This is a great keepsake for any lover of the beautiful game and the planet's greatest sporting event. It did not disappoint. The only downside is that in all of them you don't get all of the action from the penalty shoot-outs.",1295308800,,324,4.508474576271187
8142215,1,B000HXDM9Q,"ok so i was excited for this disc to arrive.. and it doesnt work.. its not region free. and that isn't good $35 down the drain.

sometimes you really wish amazon did not sell dvds, blurays that aren't from this region. its confusing, misleading.

8142217,5,B000HXDM9Q,A great DVD following on from previous titles.  The only thing missing was the Zidane headbut.,1246406400,,94,4.875
8142218,5,B000HXDM9Q,"The video quality is exceptional and the content is well done. As ususal the narration is British and rather pedestrian. How about some announcers with a visble pulse?
A few key moments are left out but that's understandable since the video is only about goals.
There are many different angles and even some scenes leading up to penalty shots.
All in all I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it highly. I only wish that the price was lower. $30 is pretty steep for any DVD.",1208908800,,479,4.517241379310345
8142219,4,B000HXDM9Q,"This DVD is a great summation of the 2006 World Cup.  It includes all the goals, but almost nothing else.

One of the biggest attractions of this DVD for me is hearing proper commentary by informed, skilled individuals which is far superior to the commentary we had to listen to in the U.S. during the televised matches.  The other strong point is the many angles from which each goals is shown.  The DVD also includes the 10 best goals and the 10 best saves.

The only weakness is that group play is a single chapter: You have to fast-forward to get to another group's goals.  I was also concerned with getting my money's worth (given the relatively high price of the DVD), but I ended up watching it several times in the first couple of weeks.

Strongly recommended.",1181779200,4,768,4.521739130434782
