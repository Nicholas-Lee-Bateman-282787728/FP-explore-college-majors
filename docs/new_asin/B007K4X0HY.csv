Yesterday deciding to get my Statham fix discovered that the same disc of the set will not work, truly disappointed I will not be ordering this set again!",1458777600,,259,4.777777777777778
5092077,1,B007K4X0HY,"I like all of the movies in this package...the ""seller"" of this package sends the package in a nice box and shrink wrapped as if you purchased it at your local Best Buy...however, only 2 of the DVD's in the package worked. For what I paid for this package, it's not worth the time and effort to ship it back for an exchange or refund.",1458259200,2,334,4.153846153846154
5092078,4,B007K4X0HY,"A good set of movies, a lot of good action & fighting scenes. All 5 movies come in one case, but in separate disc trays. Reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that Crank 2 had playing issues on my blu ray player, had to use my Xbox One to play it.",1454716800,2,244,3.6226415094339623

5092082,1,B007K4X0HY,"""Crank 2""  Disk defective. Will not play.  Not worth my  time to return to Amazon. Disappointed since it`s maybe the best film in the set..",1474848000,,139,4.48
5092083,4,B007K4X0HY,Loved the movies when they first came out. I thought this would be a nice little movie collection that my father would love. Since I also bought the first 2 transporter movies that had support for Spanish in the settings I thought why not get a collection of 5 of his best movies  and have my father watch them whenever he wants in Spanish (since that's his dominant language). I have nothing against the movies but the description of the collection needs work on telling more about what these movies hold. For example it only supports French and English. At the time of this review I only got a chance to see Transporter 3 and will update it if any of the other movies in the collection have problems playing like some reviews say. 9-21-16,1474416000,,740,4.481481481481482
5092084,4,B007K4X0HY,"First of all, let me preface my review by saying that I'm a huge Jason Statham fan. This collection contains 5 of his best performances, including both Crank films, War (the weakest showing of the group), The Mechanic, and Transporter 3. It's a Canada release, and as such the packaging is bilingual. The only complaint that I have about this collection is the lack of a slipcover. I am almost positive that the release comes with one, but my copy did not have one - just the black case.

With that being said, at the time of writing this collection is $20, making each film just $4 - which is a phenomenal deal. There are no digital copies included, but most of these are hard to find on digital copy anyway, due to their age and lack of re-releases. The only one that you could benefit from buying separately would be The Mechanic.",1473811200,2,833,4.444444444444445
5092085,5,B007K4X0HY,"This is a Great Collection for anyone looking forward to some Awesome bluray movie collection by Jason S.
In the description it clearly states for Crank 2 and to have optimal playback that your bluray player should be connected to the Internet. None of the movies are bad, they all work fine. 5",1471046400,,294,4.566037735849057

5092087,3,B007K4X0HY,"Love Jason Stathom movies, but the CRANK 2 HIGHVOLTAGE dvd was defective.  The movie it self display and played the size of a 5x7 index card.  The rest of the dvds were great except for that one.  I would love a replacement of this dvd if at all possible

Thanks",1468454400,2,262,4.18
5092088,5,B007K4X0HY,"I enjoyed these movies. Lots of action and decent humor. Jason Statham carries these movies well - sort of like a ""low-rent James Bond."" I suppose anybody looking at this set knows what they are getting. . . .
  -- ALL of the discs played just fine in the PS3 I use as a blu-ray player, for what it's worth. At least 4 of the discs were packed with extra features. I think one of the Crank discs may have held only the movie.

Good movies. Decent price. All discs play fine. 5 Stars.",1462924800,2,483,4.117021276595745
