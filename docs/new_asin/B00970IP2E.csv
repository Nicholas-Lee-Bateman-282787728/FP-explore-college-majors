Scary,Really scary docudrama/found footage effort.

So this girl from the mid-west wants to be a star,

She tried Hollywood proper and didn't do too well

and so now is willing to do porno AT ALL COSTS.

A documentary crew is on her side to follow her

dreams and become a naked legend.",1352851200,2,310,4.545454545454546
8537131,2,B00970IP2E,"Wow, Slaughter Creek's bad!  It's a found footage type of horror film which means a group of young people (a movie producer, his girlfriend and the camera guy) walk around doing nothing most of the time.  Oh wait, the one guy argues with his girlfriend 80% of the time while the camera guy sits around doing nothing.  Why do they argue?  Because the group of film makers are trying to film a documentary about the porn industry.  They visit porn stars and the main guy of the group becomes infatuated with one girl in particular- a spunky 19-year old blonde.  She doesn't have much backstory other than she got raped and she's sad about it.

Otherwise the story is about the movie producer of the documentary arguing with his girlfriend.  I was thinking ""If you don't want your boyfriend to make a documentary about porn stars, you should have either stayed at home or left him *before* you made the decision to set out and travel with him to the land of porn!""  But this thought never dawned on the girl, so the two spend their time uncomfortably dealing with each other's presence.  Often the girlfriend kicks the back of her boyfriend's seat in a moment of anger while they travel around in the car.  Just lovely.  The camera guy must feel like crap.  Other than the group having someone shoot at them with a shotgun for trespassing and later the group breaking into a house to steal video evidence, this documentary stinks.

Anyway this 19-year old porn star eventually disappears after she says she doesn't want to be part of the documentary anymore.  This is after 30 minutes of the man and his girlfriend arguing over whether to give the girl $500 to be part of their documentary or not.  Obviously the girlfirend doesn't want her boyfriend getting close to a porn star.  This porn star girl being so attractive is the only reason to watch Slaughter Creek.  Other than that one girl on girl moment in the porn house of course.  Otherwise the movie tries to go for a murder/mystery showing the movie producer guy in the investigation room trying to explain how all his friends have been killed (showing no emotion whatsoever while the investigators exaggerate their roles WAY too much- what?) but comes up waaaaaay short since, for one thing, the ending doesn't make sense (showing people running around in a field but why?) and two, the movie wastes way too much time getting to the part where the porn star disappears.  Avoid unless you like watching a man argue with his girlfriend.  I don't like seeing couples argue.",1508803200,,2527,4.659142212189616

8537135,3,B00970IP2E,"Starts a little slow, and the sound editing is bad sometimes. If you get towards then end it is a pretty good psychological movie for a low-budget production. It isn't about gore, more thought provoking.

The actors had no script, they were told what each scene was about just before filming. This made for some pretty decently acted scenes, and some badly acted scenes. Based on a true story - imdb

My wife and I liked it though. She was definitely scarred at times.",1388880000,3,468,4.559523809523809
