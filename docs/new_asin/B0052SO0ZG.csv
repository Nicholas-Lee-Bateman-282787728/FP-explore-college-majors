4530726,3,B0052SO0ZG,"John O'Hara's 1949 first ""long"" bestselling novel (his other works were fairly short), is set at the turn of the century that not only tells the story of Penn. socialite/nymphomaniac Grace Caldwell Tate, but attempts to be another great American novel. This bogged the work down considerably when O'Hara strayed from his fascinating story of his heroine.

The movie has been set in the period it was made (60s) and glosses over many important aspects of the book for the reader and now viewer to understand Grace. Although the storyline of the film pretty much follows the book, Grace is lost by an underdeveloped script.

Don't blame this on Suzanne Pleshette in the title role. She not only physically fits the role but emotionally embodies Grace when the script allows her which isn't often and thus leaving some unexplained scenes). Her performance is as always, right on target. Her sexy, husky voice and smoldering good looks made her one of Hollywood's finest discoveries in the the early 60s (although she played small parts on TV and movies in the late 50s).

The gist of the story is Grace Caldwell marries Sidney Tate (Bradford Dillman) and as they wait for their new home to be built, she falls for Ben Gazzara, a builder.

O'Hara abhorred the Penn. upper class and his books cut them to shreds. He was born into this society only to have it taken away from him when his doctor/father died when he was young and left penniless. He never relinquished his resentment and his characters are power hungry, devious and some sexually perverted in his works. O'Hara utilized dialogue to convey his explicit sex scenes.

The movie fails to spark the impact of high class society crashing down on Plesette's ears due to her unsatisfied sexual desires which are played up more in the movie than in the book. The book is about a promiscuous socialite, the movie a high society slut.

There is also a contrived scene where Grace on vacation leaves her ailing mother in her hotel room to go on the prowl, only to discover her mother had a heart attack during her absence. Her passion is jarringly inane against the silly rise of native drums as he seeks her lover.

For those of you unfamiliar with the book will find the movie, just another sexy soap opera. The book defeated itself by taking on far too many elements in the surrounding Pennsylvania countryside. But O'Hara has given us a major literary character in ""Grace Caldwell Tate"", and although she is defeated at every turn in the script, Suzanne makes the most of the part. The movie is hers. And she keeps the clunky script going due to her beauty and charisma and fine performance.

A must for her fans. If you are a literary buff, forget this movie.

4530749,4,B0052SO0ZG,"Suzanne Pleshette, a first-rate actress and one of Hollywood's most stunning beauties in the 1960's, was at the apex of her beauty in this 1950's-genre film.  (I chanced to meet her in Hollywood a few years before she passed in 2008, and she was still gorgeous.)  In Rage to Live, she portrayed a nymphomaniac who drove her male-victims (and film-fans) wild with her irrepressible sexual urges.  While the sex scenes are tepid by today's standards, Suzanne was certainly as ""hot"" as one might dream.  If you like her, as millions did, and if you enjoy looking at 1950 culture, mores, cars, clothes, etc. up close, you will love this film.",1430956800,2,638,4.7727272727272725

4530755,5,B0052SO0ZG,"A RAGE FOR SAUSAGE is a one hour and 41 minute black and white movie about a young woman with a rage for sausage.  Suzanne Pleshette (born 1937) plays a woman who is about 20 years old, but at the time the movie was released, the actress was 28 years old.  The actors also include Bradford Dillman (born 1930) and Ben Gazzara (born 1930).  Ms. Pleshette plays a concupiscent character, and most of the movie concerns hanky panky.  Another movie from the same era, NO DOWN PAYMENT, which is also in glorious black and white, concerns the same subject matter.  Both movies have an excellent script, both movies have a heavy moralistic tone, both movies have marvelous cinematography, and both movies are worthy of repeated viewings.

OPENING SCENES.  The opening minutes of A RAGE FOR SAUSAGE shows roadsigns identifying the intersection of U.S. 30 and Route 41, which according to Google maps is halfway between Lancaster, PA and Malvern, PA.  The opening minutes show barns, silos, farms, a covered bridge, a stone bridge, a long metal girder bridge, and meandering streams.  Most of the movie concerns the meandering morality of the main actors.  Before I continue, I want to mention that I liked seeing Virginia Christine, who plays a minor character.  I liked her because she was in a Twilight Zone episode (ESCAPE CLAUSE).  She was also featured in a Folger's coffee commercial.

CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT BEGINS.  Ms. Pleshette enters her house and calls for her mother.  It is a wealthy person's house.  At 4 minutes, 20 seconds into the movie, there is already a hint of what is to come.  Pleshette is unbuttoning her blouse (this was sure to heat up the bloodstream of all men watching this movie when it first came out).  A minute later, we see a full-length image of the shadow of Pleshette (completely naked) showing the outlines of her T&A. (This shadow was likely created by a cardboard cutout, because the size of the T&A are exaggerated.)  An acquaintance of Pleshette, a young man named Charlie Jay, ambles into the house and walks upstairs and enters Pleshette's bedroom.  Pleshette says to him, ""A boy with your good looks wouldn't even bother to develop a personality . . . I'm going to take a shower, good-bye Charlie.""  ""I love you"" insists Charlie Jay, forcing her on to her bed.  Pleshette resists and tries to force him away.  ""I hate you,"" she says while struggling.  But a moment later, the pair are engaged in a mutually passionate horizontal activity.

Ben Gazzara makes an entrance at 8 minutes.  He delivers groceries to Pleshette's house.  We learn that he is studying engineering at college.  In the next scene, Pleshette is making out with a boy in the back seat of a Ford Thunderbird (the boy is not Charlie Jay and is not Ben Gazzara).  At ten minutes into the movie, Pleshette's mother comes out looking for Pleshette, and suspects that something was going on in the car, and she tells her daughter to go back inside to be a good hostess to her party (her college friends are inside at the party).

OVERWORKED RESPONSE TO TEEN NECKING.  The main issue of the film is explicitly raised at 12 minutes, when the mother's doctor gives this advice: ""Well suppose she is seeing some boy, it doesn't automatically follow . . . it's the oldest problem on earth . . . you can't keep our kids locked up for 24 hours a day . . . when they're 15 years old we tell 'em sex is dynamite, don't touch it.  And 6 or 7 years later they come around and tell you they're going to get married.""

In the next scene, Pleshette is with Charlie Jay again.  They sneak into the basement den of Charlie's house, and the viewer sees the boy's mother peering out of a window and watching the sneaking couple.  At 14 minutes, they are making out on a sofa but are completely clothed.  Mrs. Jay comes into the den and catches them in the act, and scolds them both, ""I saw you sneak in . . . you ought to be ashamed of yourself.""  Pleshette replies, ""I hate to say this Mrs. Jay but you have a dirty mind.""  Pleshette leaves, and Charlie's father comes in and says, ""Admit it you little animal, I know you've had her here before.  DO YOU THINK THE NEIGHBORS DON'T TELL ME WHAT GOES ON IN THIS HOUSE WHEN I GO OUT.  THIS FINE GENTLEMAN OF A SON HAS FOUND HIMSELF A MISTRESS . . . THAT SWEET REFINED LITTLE SLUT.""  The father slaps his son, and shouts, ""YOU MANIAC . . . ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT YOURSELF IN JAIL, SHE'S A MINOR . . . YOU BONE-HEADED PUNK . . . WHAT IF SHE GETS PREGNANT!!!""  The son cowers in shame and he whimpers, ""That doesn't mean I was the one.  I know another boy she's been with, Scotty Bordner.""  (This is one of the better parts of the dialogue in this movie.)

Mrs. Jay calls up Pleshette's mother to complain.  Pleshette overhears her  mother making the phone call, and goes into her own bedroom and pretends to be innocent.  She brushes her hair.  The mother comes in and says, ""What's been going on between you and Charlie Jay . . . she said you and Charlie were making love.""  The daughter responds accurately and justifiably, ""Mama we were necking, just necking.  I don't expect to get a gold star for that!!!""  Pleshette and her mother both work each other into a frenzy, but they calm down quickly, and Pleshette hugs her mother and cries briefly.  All is quite and they bid each other goodnight.  Soon thereafter, the mother has a mild heart attack, and the family doctor makes another appearance in the movie.  ""She needs rest and quiet and peace of mind, the kinds of things you can't order at a drug store,"" says the doctor.  (This is another example of fine scriptwriting.)

At 24 minutes, Pleshette's brother gets into the act.  The brother scolds Pleshette on romancing Charlie Jay.  Pleshette openly admits her desire for sausage, stating that, ""It's almost love . . . when I feel that way I can't think of anything else . . . I can't help it.""

FIGHT SCENE AT CHRISTMAS PARTY.  The next scene is at a Christmas party with a live jazz band and lots of young white people from wealthy families, all in their early 20s.  At this party, Pleshette meets her future husband (actor Bradford Dillman).  Dillman can be recognized by his large nose, which is narrow and which takes the form of a large triangle.

The background music has a recording of the song, ""A RAGE TO LIVE,"" and which has lyrics that describe Pleshette's character (""you're stormy and wild and turbulent child of breathless ways"").  A married couple materializes at the party (actor Peter Graves and actress Bethel Leslie).  Peter Graves is another of Pleshette's favored sausages.  Although relatively minor characters in this movie, Graves and Leslie play an increasingly important role towards the end of the movie (don't worry, I do not  give away the ending).  Graves is a newspaperman who gets a job working for a newspaper owned by Pleshette's family.  The character played by Leslie suspects that something has been going on between Pleshette and Graves, and the movie includes a variety of well-acted innuendos and jealous rages.  At 33 minutes, Charlie Jay materializes at the Christmas party, and tries to horn in on the nascent relationship between Pleshette and Dillman (the long-nosed man).  At 34 minutes, Dillman beats the crap out of Charlie Jay, and that is the last we see of this character.  At 35 minutes, the new couple kiss each other.  (Okey-dokey, it is sausage time again for Pleshette.)

SAUSAGE IN THE BAHAMAS.  The next scene at a motel in the Bahamas.  Pleshette is vacationing with her mother.  They read a letter that had been sent to them from Dillman, who is on a business trip in San Francisco.  At 39 minutes, when the mother is asleep late at night, Pleshette sneaks outside to meet one of the motel employees for some yummy hanky-panky.  Then, Pleshette returns to the motel suite, and discovers the mother dead from a heart attack.  Pleshette cries and is heartbroken, but not for long, because she loves that sausage more than anything, even more than her mother.

PLESHETTE ADMITS AGAIN, THAT SHE IS A BAD GIRL.  At 44 minutes, Dillman materializes at Pleshette's home, and the couple drives off to a farm owned by Pleshette's family.  Dillman asks her to get married.  At 46 minutes, Pleshette makes a confession, ""Well, I've done some foolish things, some bad things, they weren't meant to be bad, but I guess you know what I mean.""  ""Why did you tell me that,"" Dillman responds, barking angrily.  But he quickly recovers his composure, and we see the happy couple romping together in a farm field near a herd of sheep.

BEN GAZZARA BECOMES A MAJOR CHARACTER IN THE PLOT.  The next scene is at a meeting hall, where the couple is having their wedding.  Ben Gazzara arrives at the house next door to the meeting hall, to pick up his mother, for attending his college graduation party.  The mother, obviously out of touch with the world, refers to his graduation garb as ""cape and gown.""  Gazzara corrects her, saying, ""cap and gown.""  Gazzara notices the wedding next door, and he sees Pleshette.  At 53 minutes, the storyline jumps forward by three years.  Pleshette has a 2-year old boy, the result of her marriage with Mister Bigtriangularnose (Dillman).  Gazzara was hired by Mister Bigtriangularnose to fix the barn on the farm.  Pleshette barely remembers Gazzara, but Gazzara's hormones are already in overdrive, and he says, ""I don't suppose you'd like to show me the barn.""  (This is Gazzara's way of suggesting hanky-panky.)  Pleshette is taken aback and after an uncomfortable pause she replies with mild shock, ""What?!?!?""  But Pleshette's hormones are also waking up, and she had not sampled any other sausages in the past 3 years, and the pair engage in some gentle flirting with each other.

As part of the business of fixing the barn (Gazzara's business is civil engineering), Pleshette gives Gazzara a lift for 7-miles in the rain to Gazzara's engineering firm.  At first, Pleshette is standoff-ish, and they do not talk during the drive.  At one hour and 5 minutes, it is again sausage time.  Then, a few minutes later, it is sausage time again.  Both of the rendezvous appear to occur in a motel.  (It seems to me that they are different motels, because you can see different types of night-table lamps in the background.)

CONCLUSION.  Don't worry, I don't give away the ending.  Once Ben Gazzara becomes Pleshette's main squeeze, the plotline arrives at a sustained climax, where this sustained climax involves anger, passion, suspicion, and ultimately a moralistic conclusion.  As I mentioned above, this movie has many things in common with NO DOWN PAYMENT, another excellent black and white movie that tracks the same moralistic theme.  Both movies feature a multiplicity of A-list actors.  FIVE STARS.",1402790400,5,10769,4.690336358782702
4530756,5,B0052SO0ZG,"Almost too emotionally wrenching. Suzanne struggles in an aspic of cathartic 'agit-prop' French cinema, the moralists of the American novel at apogee, the rampant flowering of American advertising, and the birth of psychiatry.
