5049437,5,B00722ZH9I,"This is a great DVD! It's the usual amazing B.B.King, but the special guests make a a special treat for lovers of the Blues. I watched it over and over!",1346371200,,152,4.1
5049438,4,B00722ZH9I,"Great concert! Very personable with all of his guests. No set list, chatting and telling stories...one of the best concerts I have seen in a long time, long live the king!!",1338163200,,172,4.580645161290323
5049439,2,B00722ZH9I,"Let me first admit that I have not actually seen this DVD. However, I was at the concert itself on Tuesday 28th June 2011 at the Royal Albert Hall in London. I am sorry to say it was a disappointment. The reason for this, sadly, was not too many special guests but B.B himself. He talked too much and sang or played too little. Yes he can still provide those subtle little licks and come out with that booming voice, but there was simply not enough of that. Clever editing may hide lots of things but it will be difficult to get away from that basic fact.
My only previous opportunity to see the Blues King was in Frankfurt in 1978. He and his band knocked me out on that occasion. In between then and now I have bought many of his LPs and CDs. I very much looked forward to seeing him again.
It is not that the man was unable to supply the goods. He was 85 at the time and performed seated, but two days prior to the Albert Hall Concert he gave a great show at the Glastonbury Festival.
I have no intention of buying this DVD. Neither should anybody else. If you want to buy a B.B. King Concert recording, go for his show at the Montreux Festival in 1993. If you want to hear those ""special guests"", buy their own products. Whatever you do, do not buy this shoddy product.
Meanwhile B.B. remains for me the greatest blues singer still alive, so I feel honour bound to still award two stars.",1333324800,13,1391,4.213483146067416
5049440,4,B00722ZH9I,"I've seen B.B. King several times over the years and own several DVDs of his.

The problem I have with this release, as with most, is that too much of the show is special guests and not enough is B.B. King. Don't get me wrong this is an excellent show and I am giving it 4 stars based on the performance as it is. I hope everyone buys it but what my collection is still missing is a complete, real B.B. King show, like the ones I've seen when I've seen him live.

Most blues shows start with the backing band playing 2 or 3 songs before the star performer takes the stage. Most blues fans know this and expect it. It's a sign of respect for the backing band, showing what they can do before the star comes out. On this DVD the backing bands songs are cut out and the disc begins with them playing as B.B. King is introduced. Would it really have killed the director to leave the first couple songs on the DVD? There was certainly room to do so and B.B. King's backing band is an excellent band.

I have some great DVDs filmed at the Royal Albert Hall and most have multiple camera angles and highlight the hall itself because it is an amazing place. This one could've been filmed anywhere. Other then an outside shot of the building before the concert you wouldn't even know where it was filmed. I know this is only a minor point but there are so many lost opportunities here that they deserve mention.

This is a good addition to my collection but still not the blu ray I was hoping for. A good blu-ray could have been a great one if more attention had been payed to the details.",1332806400,14,1580,4.204620462046204

8508704,3,B00722ZH9I,"I had no idea slash was such a great blues guitarist! And Derek trucks blows the roof off the place. But BB ... Well poor BB himself even admits he can't find the notes. He mentions during a slow blues number that he just can't find his fingers. Poor Lucille isn't sounding too good. BB's voice is in good form. And the vocals from susan tedeschi are a huge plus. I think the crowd had some mixed feelings about the show. I heard some boo's in there as well when BB was trying to get people cheer for Derek trucks...seems like a complicated night may have occurred! But, all regards to slash who I really had no idea was such an excellent blues player.",1432339200,,652,4.266129032258065
