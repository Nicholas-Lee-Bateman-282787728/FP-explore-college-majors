8040201,5,B00068HIM4,"If you liked The Leopard Son, you will like the film about making that film. The movie had natural beauty, the ""making of"" has even more of it, as ""what did not go in the film', because that footage didn't have any leopards in it. You will love the Serengeti after watching the film (about the film). It is also nice to see all the people who made The Leopard Son possible. And yes, there is about 6 minute os Stewart Copeland making and talking about composing his wonderful score (for Copeland fans)

And it's only a few bucks, don't miss your chance to buy it!",1257638400,,563,4.311320754716981
