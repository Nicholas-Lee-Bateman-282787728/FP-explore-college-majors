2350246,5,B000A26M28,"I have been with my boyfriend for five years and he is a wonderful  man.  We have enjoyed a good sex life but I always wanted to explore new things without straying.  I have tried almost anything at least once when it comes to sex. After a while though, all those toys and gadgets lose their charm and I wondered what is next to spice up our sex life.

I ordered one of the videos a while ago to see if there was anything I could do on my own to have a better orgasm.  We were so successful using what we saw the woman doing that I wanted to get more.

What I really liked about the style is that I felt like I could keep using those principles over and over to achieve a longer lasting more intense orgasm. After I watched them the first time, I spent a half an hour touching my [...]and finding new ways to make it feel good.  It was so fun to take my time and feel the tingles building in my body.

 At first, I  pulled one out everyday and watched and stroked myself and just let the feeling build up.  Then, I showed them to my boyfriend and he watched me while I masturbated like that for a long time.  At that point, I had never felt my genitals be so sensational before after several hours and days of leaving myself off at a high point.  I got on top of him and I wanted him with a passion that was so intense and exciting.  Now he wants to learn even more about touching me this way because he's having so much fun with me.  Thank you for sharing your experience. We are better lovers with each other because of it.",1147305600,31,1525,4.019933554817276

There seemed to be little difference in the methodologies applied, and those seemed very limited.  I doubt that any of these DVDs will ever be put on my player again.  A far better source of information (and far better dollar value) is the book (available from Amazon) ""She Comes First (the thinking man's guide to pleasuring a woman)"" by Ian Kerner, Ph. D.  The anatomical information is more detailed, explains far more about just what is going on down there, and how to get the desired results.

2350248,5,B000A26M28,"Female Masturbation: Every Woman's Orgasm is Unique. Volume II

It's been sometime since I watched the first of this series on female masturbation from a group that are collectively known as the Welcomed Consensus, whose aim is to promote female sexuality. When they informed me that they had produced a second female masturbation video I simply had to review it. There are so few DVDs on the market, that are produced by anyone other than the big companies that deal with this subject, that I am always interested in the smaller productions.

So I settled down one evening and began to view. If like me you have already viewed volume 1 then you will be familiar with the Welcomed Consensus technique of peaking as they have dubbed it. The good news here is that nothing about this video is dubbed, something that I found refreshing in the sound bite world we live in.

The video opens with the message that the clitoris contains more nerve endings than any other part of the body and is followed by the member of the team who will give the demonstration entering a bedroom that I would love -)) An uncluttered one, simple in design but with plenty of pillows. Susan who demonstrates the techniques for us is not naked and simply pulls her slip up to make herself comfortable.

Next follows a short biology lesson, if you have no idea which part of the female anatomy is which, and yes I'm talking to the females as well, then this is a definite plus. As the narrator tells us which part is which, Susan points to them. She then takes a small hand mirror and views her genitals, something that many women would benefit from doing.

From there on in this video get more interesting as Susan begins to touch herself after applying some lubrication. What I really enjoyed as I watched was the fact that I was privy to something that as a female it is almost impossible for me to view, how a females lips swell and change color as she became more aroused. It was wonderful to see the contractions of the vulva correspond with the sounds that were being made as Susan became more aroused and I should say also extremely erotic.

Periodically, Susan would add more lubricant or take a break and examine her genitals in the hand mirror once more.

At the end, she takes a face cloth and applies it to her vulva in order to remove excess moisture and lube before settling down and relaxing as many of us do after a good orgasm.

The video ends with a few simple well-chosen phrases and is a perfect closure for this video.

What's it all add up to?

If you're looking for an action packed adventure film then this is not the one for you. On the other hand, if your interested in a slower paced film where you get to play voyeur to something real that many of us may never experience first hand and are likely to learn something to boot, then you might want to take a look at this.

The emphasis is on the woman's enjoyment and the fact that taking your time is important. There are just the right amount of close ups and longer body shots and the fact that this is a simple film with a professional type production only added to my experience as a viewer.

I came away from this experience turned on, and wanting to find my own space to experiment with oh and I also now own a small hand mirror. I suddenly became aware that I had rarely watched myself and I learned from this video just how much a female genitals can and do change as they become more aroused.

In a world full of man made porn it was so great to find a company that focuses on female pleasure.

Pleasures of a Woman in Orgasm: Elle. Volume IV

""I've been lucky enough to review all of the volumes in an ever growing library from this small group of sexuality educators, and each one they bring out shows something new and different. This particular volume deals with a woman's orgasm and the pleasure that umm pleasuring yourself can obtain.

Elle is an extremely pretty young lady. The DVD begins as we watch Elle prepare for a self-pleasuring session. She begins by exploring every nook and cranny of her skin, something that I think is important and was glad to see brought out in the DVD. Slowly she undresses in front of a large oval mirror, which adds to the seductive images that the whole scenario creates. Once undressed, Elle lies back, and we are treated to a short but sweet anatomy lesson. It's worth mentioning here it was nice to see an unshaven vulva for once in a video.

As Elle begins to masturbate, she uses a technique described as the deliberate orgasm, a technique that I have tried myself and works very well. The idea is to keep yourself on the edge, to feel the peaks and flows of pleasure but never quite fall over the precipice of orgasm itself until you really feel you can't wait any longer. Elle demonstrates this technique in an erotic way that makes you want to pleasure your own body as you watch; in fact, that's exactly what I ended up doing, but that can be our little secret.

This video consists of both close-up shots of Elle's genitals as she nears orgasm and wonderful shots of her face and body. You can really feel her pleasure build with this combination.

What's it all add up to?

This DVD really lives up to its title, and the emphasis is definitely placed on the pleasure of a woman's orgasm, namely, Elle's. The imagery is simple but effective. The mood is seductive and erotic, and you will likely learn something from watching this as an added bonus. Not many of us get the pleasure of watching someone masturbate to orgasm, and it's nice to be able to lie back and enjoy the ride simply because we can.

If you would like to enjoy a soft and seductive look at how a woman can obtain great pleasure from orgasm, this DVD is sure to deliver.""",1138233600,43,5754,4.429924242424242

I told her I was done and she could order what ever she had in mind. She also got Vol. 1 as well. They all looked the same to me, but with different ladies. From what I saw, they looked like they all used the same technique as well. They appear to be an instructional thing, buy not sure. I was not impressed with this stuff and didn't really watch but the first part before going off to do something on the computer.

Love your DVDs.  I wanted to thank you and tell you how great your video ""Female Masturbation: Pleasures of a Woman in Orgasm - Elle"" is.  I have learned so much about the beautiful clitoris.  Actually, [...] I love to and thank you for a wonderful DVD.

Obviously a lot of satisfaction for me and an education as well.  Every woman I've dated I've also taken great pride and enjoyment in...  So far all of them have been satisfied.  I'll be sure to continue my education and pleasure with more female masturbation DVDs.  Masturbation, how sweet it is!

8072371,5,B000A26M28,"This is a set of four DVD's each one showing a beautiful female masturbating, mostly close-up.  But it is totally different from the writhing bodies that you see in pornography.  All of these women are apparently having intense orgasms but without much body movement except that of their one index finger making tiny movements on their clits, and the response of the vulva to this finger movement.

The simplicity of presentation makes you want to absorb every word that is said, by the female narrator as well as in the explanatory phrases that flash across the screen.  And together with the simple but beautiful music in the background, you know there is something important being said and demonstrated.

These women's vulvas look very natural. And the women look beautiful even though they are hardly made up at all.  This gives the feeling that what is going on is real. The words I would use to describe the orgasms that are demonstrated here are subtle, but intense.

Maybe that sounds like a contradiction.  But hey, some of the most powerful things I have ever experienced are subtle, but intense.  Like Beethoven's 9th Symphony, for instance.  It begins with sustained notes that build in intensity with more and more instruments being added, giving the sound a gradually richer texture.  It keeps building, until the fourth movement which is the famous, glorious rhythmic theme made up of quarter notes, that swell and subside, and build up again with the power of the whole orchestra and chorus.  The gradual intensification brings you up so high, transcending the physical, until you are no longer bound by the limits of your little body.  You feel this intense expansion, and the stiller you are, the more you can appreciate the breadth of it.  If you start to buggie wildly, you miss some of the experience.

I would say the same thing about this ""Deliberate Orgasm"" technique, which is what this kind of masturbation is said to produce.  My girlfriend and I have been watching these videos together, and she is appreciating the subtle intensity more and more.  It's not that we never like to get down and buggie anymore, because we definitely do, at times.  But our sex life has definitely taken on a new dimension since we've been watching this Female Masturbation Collection.  It's like we have this whole menu of sexual experiences available to us, from downright raunchy to uplifting and expansive.

But here is the real bonus:  Our sex acts always used to be all about the last explosive moments.  Now we appreciate every note of the symphony, or every stroke of the sex act.

And, in case you thought that orgasm that's like a symphony could not be sexy, these videos are quite so.  For instance, the footage of Elle turning her body on before masturbating is some of the sexiest stuff I have ever seen on video.  It is only a beautiful young woman enjoying herself, stroking her pretty body for the pure pleasure of it.  But it is a turn-on, and worth watching just for the fun of it.

This video collection is unique, not anything like I've seen produced elsewhere.  It is worth every penny.  This collection will open your eyes to the beauty of women and the pleasures of pleasuring them the way they like it.",1191196800,10,3234,4.755834829443447

8072373,5,B000A26M28,"Every woman's orgasm is my favorite but it is interesting to be a witness to four different real women having this experience and being able to view it this close. These women are ""normal"" in the sense that the producers did not shop around for models that fit the beauty standards of fashion magazine and such. It is refreshing to see.

As I have said these products are different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy, they show women actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in their body and show what it looks like.

It shows a way of stretching the sensation out that can really tweak the reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing, a mind bender so to speak, and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for women and how they experience it.",1177027200,32,815,4.537414965986395
8072374,5,B000A26M28,"Until I discovered the Female Masturbation Collection I had not seen any instructional videos on how to directly touch the clitoris and that is the primary focus here. These videos highlight different facets of female orgasm. From the visual signs of orgasm that can be seen and recognized, to a live anatomy lesson, changes in color, fullness and engorgement of the genitalia, to demonstrations of pleasurable ways to touch and stroke other parts of the body to heighten sensitivity.

I was impacted by how precise and deliberate the women touch themselves and I think deliberate is the key word here to describe what is happening. My partner and I found these women to be great role models of female sexuality. Men and women should see these videos, because they show a non stereotypical view of female masturbation.  This is not a glossy view of the female form but a nicely done realistic portrayal of women pleasuring themselves. Overall, I found them mind expanding and worth seeing.",1176681600,16,989,4.951807228915663
8072375,5,B000A26M28,"If you do, you need first to learn how a woman receives pleasure.  That is the goal of the Female Masturbation series from The Welcomed Consensus.

I have seen a great many female masturbation videos.  I believe these are some of the very best of that variety.  If you are expecting a porn star type screaming ""I'm coming, I'm coming, . . ."" you will be disappointed.  What you will get is a first class look at attractive women giving themselves real pleasure.  That is what I liked most about it.  It is real!

Each of the videos starts off with a woman lying down in comfortable position and spreading her legs.  She shows you her anatomy in a very explicit but tasteful way.  The woman then stokes her genitals using the ""DO-ing"" techniques pioneered by The Welcomed Consensus over the past decade (see Deliberate Orgasm videos).  One of the best things about the series is that you get to hear the real sounds of arousal from each woman.  Pleasant instrumental music is playing in the background throughout each video.  No vibrators buzzing, no phallic dildos, no fake orgasms, just a woman enjoying one of nature's most delightful gifts (her own body).

Overall the production values are good (almost like those found in good ""amateur"" videos).  This seems fitting because that is what they started out as (a group of people who love sex wanting to share their knowledge). There is only one camera which zooms from full body and face to close ups of the genitals.  The production values do get better as the series progresses.  The sound quality on the first video is fair at best but that also lends to its charm.  There is a female voice over for narration which will help if you are not familiar with female anatomy or masturbation.  Each woman is not performing a sex show, but is simply letting you watch her masturbate.  This gives the videos a very intimate feel, not like a sterile ""how to"" tape.  The series gives you the best of both instruction and eroticism.",1169596800,39,1976,4.620689655172414
