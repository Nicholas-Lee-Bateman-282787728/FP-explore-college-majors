2052483,3,B00020HBX2,"I don't understand why everyone thinks this show is so original. I have seen shows where paper is turned into a weapon before, where they have a dumb ditzy blonde character, and a little kid who has a giant, annoying ego. I have to give kudos to the show since it does bring the art of paper manipulation to a brand new level, almost to the point it seems too unreal even for fantasy. Sadly, this extreme action only happens in the first episode. The three episodes afterward are more concentrated on the characters' personalities.

Not to say that these episodes were bad; they were pretty entertaining. It seems the purpose of these first few episodes is to introduce several little conflicts that will eventually grow into big ones- like the sister's ellusive employer and Nenene's new novelist competitor. I also learned quite a few things about the main characters like how one of the sisters like tiny dark spaces and Nenene has a very bad temper.

Though I think this beginning is a little weak, it appears that the show will get much more entertaining very soon. Well, that's what I've heard from other people.",1112054400,3,1118,4.698979591836735
2052484,5,B00020HBX2,"Who would have thought a series about novel writers, librarians, and book lovers would be so much fun?  Obviously Geneon did since they brought it here for YOU to see for yourself!

  While I think it is fair to describe my acquaintence with anime as modest at best; I cannot recommend this series enough.

  First off, there is a lot of anime with great music and background score but so rarely do you find one with the range and subtlety that ROD the TV has to offer.  The best comparison that I can come up with would be the British television show ""the AVENGERS"" as both series' scores work best when it comes to evoking a particular mood--especially the slower, quieter moments.

  Make no mistake, however, this show is highly action and comedy oriented with a lot of appeal for young or old, male or female, new anime fan or seasoned veteran.  Normally I watch rather serious, science fiction oriented anime and it is quite nice to find a series with a simple objective: FUN!!

  Bottom line: great visuals, brilliant musical score, and great character dynamic with an truly original story makes ROD the TV the series to watch in 2005!",1109376000,,1142,4.611940298507463
2052485,5,B00020HBX2,They did a wonderful job in transitioning this series from the OAV.  They got me very interested in the characters.  I would recommend this series to anyone that enjoys anime.  It is funny and exciting to watch.,1106697600,,211,4.648648648648648
2052486,4,B00020HBX2,"Certainly the TV series is a different tone than the original OAV.

If you've not seen the original Read or Die OAV, then you will go into this series and probably enjoy the pace and the writing.

However, if you have seen the wonderful OAV, then when you start this series you may be a bit taken aback.  The pace of the OAV reminds me of the pace of the Indiana Jones movies - you are almost breathless by the time you sit thinking about the final scene of the heroine and her new friend.

While there are certainly action sequences in the TV series, they are sporadic.  And in fact, to be honest, some of the stories with action were confusing to me.

On the other hand, I did not find the non-action driven episodes boring - in fact, just the opposite.  I am drawn to character driven writing more than explosions and killings, so I find the episodes where we learn bit by bit about Nenene, and watch her relationship with the three sisters evolve, as well as learn about the background of the sisters, through the first dozen or so episodes of this series to be a wonderful thing.

(of course, the 12 episodes are not all on this dvd - they are spread across the first few dvds...).

So take a chance, try the first dvd or two, and decide for yourself whether this is a series of interest to you.",1104883200,3,1300,4.273469387755102
2052487,4,B00020HBX2,"After many months (possibly years) of looking for a decent Japanese cartoon finally I can sit down and watch something that is Japanese and isn't riddled with foul sexual content or humor, over the top violence, and romance! ""R. O. D.  (Read or Die): The TV"" is exactly the kind of Anime I can enjoy with a smile on my face.

Story; Vol. 1--- (5/5): Famous novelist Nenene Sumiregawa takes a trip to Hong Kong for a promotion on the first novel she had ever written (if my memory serves me correctly), still suffering from a four year writers block. She meets her 'guide' Michelle, a high spirited blonde who is incapable of spelling Nenene's name correctly and her sister Maggie; an unusually tall young woman who is a big fan of Nenene and books of all types. When they take her to the penthouse she supposed to have been staying, it explodes and authorities discover it was an attempt on her life by someone not so fond of her writing.

Nenene, however is not swayed by the threat against her life and does not opt for hiding despite the danger surrounding the situation. Michelle and Maggie decide to stick by her side and protect her (against her wishes) until the threat upon her life has passed. Nenene then meets the youngest sister of the three, Anita; a loud mouthed girl with a tomboyish, bratty personality who is greatly opposed to books and Nenene herself, unlike her sisters. Beyond this, the story becomes slightly complex, shrouded in a complete mystery until much later into the series.

Animation/Art--- (5/5): Thankfully there is not a trace of CGI animated scenes to be found in R. O. D.  Everything is strictly painted and drawn; the character animations are a downright treat to watch, everything from the vehicles movies realistically with a hint of unlogical-ness added into the mix. The cities and characters in the show were done very beautifully, there are touches of real still pictures in the background at times but its hardly noticeable.

Music--- (4/5): The music used in this series has this sort of mellow tune to it, that basically translates into very relaxing. I am unable to describe is fully, I can only say its done quite well and that it reminds me of Jazz most of the time.

Characters--- (4/5): By far the big drawer of this show aside from the action are the characters. Be it minor or major, the characters in R.O.D. have personalities that could match a variety of people. Maggie, despite her semi antisocial and shy personality, she is a humble character and it quite firm when she wants to be, however she prefers not to harm anyone she is close to. Michelle isn't my favorite character but her stereotypical 'bubbly blonde' appearance is the complete opposite of her character. Michelle, being the oldest of the three of them is firm and makes all the decisions acting as the parent and being part of the glue that keeps their friendship with Nenene together. Anita is probably more adult than her older sisters are; she has her moments of maturity and understanding when someone is down on their luck or just feeling bad. However, Anita remains the bratty child, with a dark past concerning books. And she, more or less is the brawn of the three sisters. Nenene, is a nice depiction of a brooding Novelist suffering from writers block, in need of some 'bodyguards' who just might be the thing to release her from the lack of inspiration needed to write. The rest of the characters are the same compared to the four main characters, but most of them are annoying and one-dimensional.

Voice Acting---- (English 5/5; Japanese 4/5): I'm no purist but I did listen to Vol. 1 in Japanese, it wasn't bad at all, however, if I had to choose the English dub is where the real talent is that. Its very charismatic and never betrays the emotion shown on the characters faces.

DVD--- (3/5): The DVD consists of the same requirements of a Geneon DVD; trailers, episode previews, chapter selection, audio, subtitle, and language choices. Not much to say on that.

Total: This series is funny in its own sense and meaning of the word. The story is a completely original from anything I've ever seen and doesn't let you in on anything surrounding the mysterious organization Maggie, Michelle, and Anita work for until later as I said before. It gets a 4 out of 5.",1102550400,3,4300,4.683443708609271

2052489,5,B00020HBX2,"Put simply, any fan of the original ""Read or Die"" OVA series should watch R.O.D the TV... The first half of the series seems only midly connected to the original Read or Die OVA because it is based on the ""Read or Dream"" manga/comic which features a different cast. The second half of the series (episodes 14-26) combine ""Read or Die"" and ""Read or Dream"", in terms of both characters and plotline. You will come to realise that R.O.D the TV is far better than ""Read or Die""!

 Some people might not be that impressed with the first volume of R.O.D the TV, due to a total lack of action scenes in episodes 2 and 3. Well, from Volume 2 onwards, there is far more action... the reason for the two comedy-based episodes is that Read or Dream is based is far less action-orientated than Read or Die and concentrates more on the silly anticts of the characters. The first episode of Volume 1: The Paper Sisters will be very pleasing to action fans, while the fourth episode has a nice action finish. I found episodes 2 and 3 to be very amusing rather than dull; some may disagree, but are sure to enjoy the rest of the series as it is more action packed.

 R.O.D the TV seems a little odd for the early episodes, but it turns into one of the best anime series in years. It has great action, great fun and yet moments of great emotion and tension.

 Worthy of note is that Geneon has done an absolutely fantastic job with dubbing this series, making it even more re-watchable as it is enjoyable in both language tracks. The voice of Anita is especially impressive: for children in this series they used real child actors, and thanfully these children can act! Anita's lines are much funnier when you hear them coming from a real child.",1090368000,23,1728,4.418238993710692
2052490,5,B00020HBX2,"I first saw the original OVA of R.O.D. at Anime Express in Daytona, this was about 6 mnths b4 it was put out on market. Meanwhile in those months I desperately tried to make the DVD my own......but I had to wait. Now we have a series, uckily it is linked to yomiko and crew, cuz if it wasn't it wouldnt have been as good, well IMHO. The characters are funny, with witty dialogue and hilarious situations, with the right touchs of emotion. The action is superb, and these sisters do more things with paper than I ever dreamed of Yomiko doing. The middle episodes are kinda boring, but it is giving us nice deep character development, so be happy with it.",1089590400,2,653,4.360655737704918
2052491,4,B00020HBX2,"For those who have seen the OAV, you will come into this expecting the same unique style and grace that caressed the OAV series that follows Yomiko Readman more commonly known as ""The Paper,"" released earlier by Manga Entertainment.  However, upon watching this, you see a few differences that bring up disappointment.
First, the animation of a TV series is usually of lower quality than that of OAV series or movies; this seems to be the case.  I felt that the characters were not drawn as well as I had come to appreciate within the OAV series.  The music also lacked the same sort of emotion and 'coolness' seen from the OAVs.  But these things apart, there are things that were done as well and these were stressed more in what a longer series could provide - a more developed story and stronger character development.
This 26 episode series follows a new lead female, Nenene Sumiregawa, who is a writer in some sort of rut.  She was friends with Yomiko Readman but she mysteriously disappeared a few years earlier and no news has been heard from her despite her constant search.  On a trip to Hong Kong to discuss plans with turning her previous novel into a film, she is attacked.  However, luckily girls from the Three Sisters Agency came to save the day, and as you can assume, these girls can manipulate paper.  The story continues on (albeit with MANY plot twists) with the sisters taking on a job to be Nenene's bodyguard and they learn to get along as well as really feel attached to one another.
The real highlight of the release of this series is in the packaging.  With the many boxes being released for new series, it is hard to truly distinguish them from each other as being unique.  The R.O.D TV series' box is just that: unique.  With the box being a book, it is very relevant to the series as this series revolves around the love of books and some conspiracy on having some of them.  I guess the downpoint to this sort of box is that while it conserves space, you don't have a place to hold the other DVD cases as you buy each additional volume.
Final Note: I think now we realize that the anime DVD market has become a sort of art as companies are coming up with new ways, competing to stand out or have a unique release.  It's bad for our wallets but it's good for the companies.  Geneon (formerly Pioneer) always finds ways to outdo itself.  Bravo.",1088294400,16,2372,4.470997679814385
2052492,5,B00020HBX2,"I watched the fansubs of this when it was out in Japan, and I can't wait to get the dvds. ROD may look 'cutesy', but it's far from shallow and there's a lot of excellent action and animation to boot. I'm a 29 year old guy, and my friends and I are shamelessly hooked on this show, so don't think it's just for kids or girls.
What really gets you addicted, though, are the endearing characters and the strong bonds they have to each other. Just as they care for each other, you care for them, and that keeps you hooked as they get into one perilous situation after another.
Fans of the original OVA may be put off by the fact that Yomiko Readman & crew are not the main characters in this show. Once you get to know the paper sisters, though, you won't mind a bit. And if you wonder what happened to Yomiko, Drake, and Ms. Deep after the OVA... well, you'll be in for a real treat a bit later on in the series ;)
Story/Plot: - 8 - Gets a bit convoluted at the end, but it's fun and original.
Animation - 9 - Excellent, especially for a 26-episode show.
Sound/Music - 8 - The music is great, and I like the new version of the ROD theme even better than the OVA's intro. The Japanese voice acting is great, and really brings the characters to life.
So, um, GET IT!",1087948800,9,1261,4.109311740890688

2052494,5,B00020HBX2,"*IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT THIS SET IS DISCONTINUED*

This is a series I watch again and again.

Nenene Sumerigawa (close personal friend of Yomiko Readman from the ROD movie) is in Japan trying to write her new book after a long period of writers block.  Controversy surrounding her new work has led to attempts on her life, and she is put under the care of three bodyguards; Michelle, Maggie and Anita.. the Paper Sisters.  The story progresses from comic escapades and about midway thru (slight spoiler) arcs rather suddenly (though not jarringly) into a huge end of the world as we know it conspiracy story.. relating back to the first movie.

This series has what I would call a wonderful softness to it.  There's alot of material here that's genuinely touching, beautiful use of color, and Taku Iwasaki's score is nostalgic genius. While the original ROD movie was more of a globe-trotting action packed fantasy spy story.. this series is really rooted in the bond these 4 women have for one another. The confusing story elements never overwhelm that aspect, which I admire this series for. Versimiltude- there's an emotional truthfulness here that really wowed me.  I found myself instantly bonded to them and had to watch the whole thing in about 2 days.

It doesn't hurt to watch the original movie, as certain characters re-appear, making the action a little more obvious near the end, but I don't think it's totally necessary.  Having watched the show first, I found the film rather thin in story and emotion.

My only complaint is it wasn't released in a widescreen format, that imo wouldve been perfect.

Also, FYI, it's not a terribly violent show, doesn't use much profanity.. I'd rate it (occasionally) PG.",1223510400,,1720,4.876288659793815
2052495,5,B00020HBX2,"I purchased this complete series and find it to be very enjoyable.  It is difficult to find this set and I was able to find it here.  Factory package was well designed, much better than many of the multi-disc sets I have seen for other sets.  Quality & operation of all the DVD's is good.

2052496,5,B00020HBX2,"Lots of reviewers did a great job on the characters and plot so my review focuses primarily on the DVD box set itself.  First of all, I highly recommend that you purchase the the real Region 1 set.  Yes, you can go on eBay and buy a cheap, bootleg version, which I actually did last year.  You get what you pay for.  That set, while inexpensive, was just plain bad.  The quality was grainy and the subtitles were just ridiculous. The translations were so bad I couldn't finish it.  English sentences were literally butchered and not put together correctly (i.e. verbs in front of nouns, misspellings, even nonsensical words were included). Second, with this box set there are a few nice goodies included.  The disc inserts have some very good artwork and also included are some pencil boards which are slim plastic pieces about the size of the DVD insert which have some pretty artwork on it - actually one side of each pencil board is a bit more ""racy"" than the other (a bit of fan service) but they're really nice things that are likely not included with the bootlegs.

The DVD extras are pretty sparse. There are a few character summaries and some still shots.  You can also turn on the American production commentary.  I have not yet listened to it so I don't know how informative it is.  I will say that the soundtrack is really good - the music matches the action very well.

The DVD default setting is for English dubbing but can easily be changed to Japanese language with English subtitles, which I greatly prefer for anime.  One of the reasons I enjoy Japanese anime is because of the Japanese language  and some of the voice inflections are lost in translation.  Many otakus may agree with me that what is so addictive about anime in part has to do with how the Japanese language is spoken, expressions used, etc.  This is pretty much lost using English speaking actors.

Just a quick word on the DVD plot/characters: this particular series is very good for many reasons already listed by other reviewers.  The plot is pure science fiction but I like that it is not formulaic.  I love Sailor Moon but I have to say that every season of that show is very predictable and formulaic.  This isn't a monster of the week show and the plot seems much more serial with each episode building on the last.  Also, while a bit subtextual, there is Yuri (girl/girl love or romance) to be found here if you want to see it.  There's definitely some fan service, too, with large bosomed women jiggling from time to time (one episode involving Drake and the archaeolgist, Alice, he is protecting shows full frontal breast nudity).  It's mostly not gratuitous but just a little bit of eye candy every now and then for the fanboys (and some girls) out there.

Bottom line, buy this DVD box set (Region 1) before it goes out of print.  This is a series that I've watched more than a few times and when you watch DVDs more than once, it's really worth every penny.",1204761600,,2954,4.53875236294896
2052497,5,B00020HBX2,"I figured that an anime centered around books would really keep me interested and even though R.O.D starts off kind of slowly.  It more than makes up for that with the interesting effects and attacks that the Paper Sisters use in their various adventures whether its protecting author Nenene from her stalker fans or looking for her best friend who's gone off missing for the past few years.  That storyline leads down the whole road of the series as a whole.  I don't want to give away much but it really picks around that point with various characters good/bad and some mixed in between that you aren't quite sure about.

But this series is one that requires patience and rewards you for said patience so take a trip in this excellent anime series featuring the Paper Sisters...Read or Die might even make you wanna pick up a book after your done with this series that clocks in at 26 episodes.  If that doesnt happen its cool you'll still enjoy the time invested in following this one through until the end.

Love it!!

Read or Die (Complete Collection) gets as close to a 5 out of 5 as possible.",1198886400,,1099,4.52020202020202
2052498,5,B00020HBX2,"And when I say ""one of my favorites"" I mean darn near the top of the list.  There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, so I'll try to be inventive.

This show is good.  Some people will say it has some slow episodes, and it does, but I like them.  They develope the characters and give you an idea of who these people are that you're supposed to be caring about.  And it does a good job of that.  Then the action and plot gets going and you won't want to stop watching.  There's conspiracies and secret plots and information control and evil empires, all on the subject of books and the crazy Brit, Mr. Joker (Joseph Carpenter, though no one calls him that).  But you already knew that.

The action is good when it's around, which is often enough, but the show isn't about a group of super-warriors fighting progressively stronger bad guys until they fight the ""big boss"" to save the world--nothing that trite.  There's genuine intrigue and plot and suspense and you'll love every minute of it.

I whole-heartedly recommend the show, but don't even spend upwards of a hundred dollars on the set.  That's rediculous.  I got it in a three-disc set on eBay for about thirty dollars.  It may have been a bootleg of some kind--I don't know, it looks real enough--but it's surely a bargain.  There's no reason to split this whole series into seven discs when you can do it on three.

Other than that, this show is great.  And that one negative comment, which doesn't even have to do with the show itself, is all I've got.  I haven't seen the OVA (R.O.D. - Read or Die) yet, but I plan to very soon.  I do know, however, that you don't need to see the OVA to enjoy the series, which is a good thing.  But after seeing the series you'll most likely want to get the OVA, like I do.",1196121600,,1787,4.3093093093093096

2052500,5,B00020HBX2,"I agree very much with the previous reviewer A. Schneider insofar as I too believe this to be well animated for a Japanese TV series, very good character development and high quality artistry. Each episode is generally a stand alone story and these vary from moderately interesting to extremely well written. While there are the usual adolescent nods in the production (magic, self possessed sub or early teens), there is are also quite deep psychological insights and values that slip from the screen writers' pens that make these episodes more than the original idea. I highly recommend this series for the serious collector.",1174348800,,627,5.097087378640777
2052501,5,B00020HBX2,"An anime with a strong story arc for adults.  The very odd title doesn't represent it, the artsy geisha nudes don't quite fit with the personality of the screenplay.  What you get are four girl action super-heros that seem like real people, vulnerable and often silly until a crisis hits and then they are serious business.

The three Paper Sisters are Michelle (oldest, bubbly, blonde, very feminine), then Maggie (taciturn, stoic, strong, and tall), and then 13-year-old Anita (tomboy, combative, smart).  They have powers over paper, turning it into shields, weapons, and familiars.

The story is about their odd jobs that they use to support themselves, the chief of which is to act as bodyguard for the an unwilling Japanese author by the name of Nenene.

For whatever flaws it has, it generates in most episodes truly memorable moments.  If you liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV) you will like this just as much.  Those that complain about the pacing and the ""wandering"" of the plot either just missing the point, or missing the kind of anime that has a money-shot of something blowing up or getting whacked every 90 seconds.

The action when it happens is great, but not what is best about ROD.  Very few animes are worth five stars, and this is one of them.",1155340800,7,1266,4.76605504587156
2052502,5,B00020HBX2,"Nenene Sumiregawa is a famous author beloved by millions but she has two problems. The first is that she's had writer's block ever since a beloved friend, Yomiko Readman, disappeared 5 years ago. In addition to being her friend, Yomiko was a secret agent of the British Library, known as ""The Paper"", which signified her abilities as a ""Paper Master"". With this ability, she was able to bend paper from any source to her will. Although this doesn't sound like an awesome power, you can construct weapons, fashion planes, shields, cut through metal, etc. Nenene's second problem is that someone wants to kill her! Her editor hires three young ladies, who also turn out to be freelance Paper Masters, to serve as bodyguards to Nenene. After foiling an assassination attempt in Hong Kong, the girls follow Nenene to Tokyo and begin to adjust to life in Japan, even as they mooch off of her by moving into her apartment without her permission...and continue to risk their lives to protect hers!

Some anime viewers have been put off by this series, but I loved this first volume. It unfolds slowly like a live action weekly series or a series of short films instead of a typical anime. There isn't tons of action, but the little there is will knock your socks and your head off, so connect it with a thread of paper! Of course, as with all first volumes, you can either start with action and build characters later, or start with characters first. The writers of this series take the latter approach. Michelle is the de facto leader of the Sisters, even though she might not be the brightest. Maggie is a mumbling lanky, boyish, and distant personality, and is thereby the calmest of the sisters. Anita is her polar opposite, being the youngest, and is always quick to fly off the handle, especially because she really dislikes Nenene, but she might be the smartest of the three. A good conflict right off the bat is that Michelle and Maggie love books while Anita HATES them. There is a lot of humor in this show, but it retains a ""coolness"" factor through its writing and the fluidity of its action sequences. The soundtrack also provides nice James Bond like orchestration for the adventures of the Paper Sisters. Good show, especially for people with a love for books.

I would also recommend the Read Or Die OVA and the manga version of Read or Die. Cowboy Bebop and Full Metal Panic would also be good shows to view.",1148688000,,2418,4.647196261682243

It should be noted that this series is mistakenly called ""Read or Die the TV"" which it is not, it is ""R.O.D. the TV"" a spin off from the novel series which started the OVA Read or Die which ended up branching off both this series for the American audience and Read or Dream, a manga series (a new series I hear is in the works as I write this. This is an important distinction to make because the story arc which this series follows is extremely different from the original Read or Die novels as well as the Read or Dream mangas.

So what can you expect with R.O.D. the TV? Plot twists, librarians, book store owners, evil corporations all of which is tied together with magical powers to manipulate paper and also manages to resurrect some loveable characters from the ""Read or Die"" movie (the OVA for which the series was based on). Slow moving and yet depressingly so as was the case in my opinion with Witch Hunter Robin, R.O.D. the TV will have you hooked in no time with some of the best character development and original story seen thus far in anime!

Truly a wonderful production... though I'd suggest you rent the OVA and then the first couple of DVDs before buying it to make sure you'll love it just as much as some of the other die hard fans out there! Trust me though, there's a lot to love about it!",1134259200,16,1719,4.58957654723127
2052507,5,B00020HBX2,"I've been watching anime for many a year now, and when I stumbled upon the R.O.D OVA, which aired on Adult Swim some time ago, I was compelled to watch the TV series as well. Setting obvious TV series and OVA differences aside, R.O.D the TV was one of the best animes I have ever had the delight of viewing. The storyline is deep and original, albeit slow at times, and the animation and ideas are top notch. Overall, this series stands on its own, not requiring any proven anime success types (oversexed girls, super-ninjas, etc.) to be entertaining.",1131062400,6,551,4.575757575757576
2052508,5,B00020HBX2,"finally an anime series that has all the action AND main characters are female whose goal is something other than attracting the boy. ok, i know there are others out there but there are few. good character development to the point that you care about the three sisters and nenene. there are a some PG-13 themes and action scenes but i would not hesitate to get this series for my 13 year old niece. i almost caved to poor reviews and didn't watch this series, but i am so happy i didn't. female anime lovers should really check this series out.",1126656000,2,544,4.396039603960396
2052509,5,B00020HBX2,"*NOTE: This review was written after viewing the series from its original releases, not the box set, which is exactly the same material.*

There are several anime that I adore, including Evangelion, .hack//SIGN, Excel Saga, RahXephon, Infinite Ryvius, and Last Exile. And then there's Pioneer/Geneon's R.O.D: The TV, one of the most stylish and intriguing of them all.

First of all, most newcomers will want to watch the movie R.O.D: Read or Die (released in North America by Manga Entertainment) before tackling the TV series, as it provides some back-story to the 26-episode show. R.O.D: The TV focuses on Nenene Sumiregawa, a famous author and close friend of secret agent Yomiko Readman, who has gone missing since the events of the movie. Nenene has recently become the target of terrorist threats, and her publisher has hired the Three Paper Sisters Detective Agency to serve as her bodyguards.

Like Yomiko, the Sisters are Paper Masters, which means that they can manipulate simple paper into razor-sharp weapons, fierce beastlike creatures, and even giant paper airplanes that can soar through the sky. They are Michelle Chan (a bubbly blonde who has a soft spot for books and small children), Maggie Mui (a strong, silent, and emotional bibliophile), and Anita King (a loud, temperamental adolescent who hates books but loves milk and stuffed animals). They are also assigned to locate a series of legendary books that the British Library also is taking a peculiar interest in.

Joseph ""Joker"" Carpenter is back as the devious, suave leader of the British Library, as is his assistant Wendy (no longer the bumbling secretary of the movie but a hardened, serious businesswoman). U.S. agent Drake Anderson, Yomiko, and Nancy Makuhari also reappear as major characters before too long. Some of the new characters include Junior (a shy young agent of the British Library who shares Nancy's ability to ""phase"" through solid matter) and Sonny Wong, a member of Asian publisher Dokusensha who is an extremely powerful Paper Master in his own right.

Unlike several shows, R.O.D: The TV takes the time to establish its main characters without neglecting the plot at hand. When it's providing some exposition to characters like Junior, Anita's friend Hisami, and the Paper Sisters themselves, it hits the right emotional notes and makes the cast human and possible to relate to. When it delves into the underlying storyline, dramatic scenes and fights, it accomplishes them with aplomb. The battles are well-animated and choreographed and showcase the Sisters' powers with great amounts of style. We steadily learn of the importance of the secret books without being handed too much at once.

There are some occasional weak parts, such as one bizarre episode in which the Sisters wander through a town with a set of conspiracies against them. But this is otherwise an exciting show to experience, and to me, it was worth every penny.",1120694400,34,2935,5.116910229645094
2052510,5,B00020HBX2,This is a really good anime. At first it seems weird or lame or just stupid. But after a little (like 3 or 4 episodes) you will be staring at the tv and when an episode is over you will be wanting to know whats going to happen next. This anime also has great rewatch value and i would recommend it to any one who likes anime. This anime in a way is weird but then again most animes are weird but weird can be good. Like hellsing (not vanhellsing) hellsing is a kick @$$ anime if you like animes i gave Hellsing 5stars as well. Those are both really good animes you should pick tehm up when you get the chance.,1118102400,,609,4.0

8019524,5,B00020HBX2,"since I watch this I've been trying to think what to say that wouldn't give away too much, but here goes. if you haven't seen R.O.D. the movie first you're going to be a little confused. if you have seen the movie we pick up 5 to 6 years after the events of the movie.
if you were expecting to see Yomiko a.k.a. The Paper or Nancy a.k.a. Miss Deep right off the back you'd be sadly mistake. we do not see them until episode 15 where their hiding in a Library. instead we start with a 20 something write named Nenene who was a student of Yomiko's. Nenene is in Hong Kong for a book signing and her editor gets her a set of tour guides named Michelle and Maggie who have a little sister named Anita. now Michelle and Maggie are just like Yomiko they love books, Anita how ever does not. but these three do have one thing in common they are paper masters like Yomiko and it seems that Nenene has been looking for Yomiko for some time. Nenene has been having some writers block on her new book and a life with these three is just what she needs to knock out the cob webs. over the cores of the series the four of them become very good friend that Michelle, Maggie, and Anita add Nenene to the family.
you do learn the truth about the three sister and why Yomiko and Nancy where hiding in a library. we do many of the main characters from the movie and some news. it is a good watch in all. ow before I forget the copy I have disc one reads episodes 1 thur 5 its only 1 thur 4.",1525824000,,1472,4.027303754266212

8019529,5,B00020HBX2,"I won't be reviewing the series if you haven't seen it by now then just give it a watch, it's worth it. This will be about the L.E.Box Set its self. R.O.D. (the TV) became an instant classic for me over a decade ago and I really wanted to better my collection by adding yet another limited edition piece. Reading the info about this L.E.B.S. I saw that it had 1 disc witch is fine as I own the entire series already but when it came, all 7 discs were included! Had they advertised that better (or at all) I would have gotten this much sooner! The cover is very book-like and feels fantastic. It almost smells like a book too. the clear pieces are like pages in a book that open up and have the discs on either side except for the 7th witch is alone in the back. It comes with the back page of the first DVD hot-glued to the back rather tackaly but comes off with no damage to the ""leather"" assuming you know how to remove stickers properly, other than that my only gripe would be with the clasp that keeps it closed. It's good enough but with years of opening and closing it will slowly stop holding as it's basically just a plastic nub jammed into a plastic hole... but that should by NO means stop you from getting it, just something to watch out for.  All in all This is and amazing piece for any fan of the series. Especially if you can get it new for 80$ like I did.",1400544000,,1371,4.115671641791045

8019531,3,B00020HBX2,Usually don't review gift purchases but I happened to watch part of this after my sister plopped it into the DVD player.

Will have to check that out sometime.,1380240000,,306,4.116666666666666

Again, a great product for fans of the series.",1313366400,,417,4.253164556962025
8019533,5,B00020HBX2,"This older series appears to be 'out of print', so one might only be able to find it used. It's also rather pricey.
  But it is well worth it. The storyline is long and complex, and sometimes moves at a glacial pace, but I always found myself watching 'one more episode'. The plot revolves around a young female Japanese (where have we seen THAT before?!) writer, named Nenene and her imposing 'bodyguards', three, 'papermasters' who can manipulate paper to their wills. While protecting Nenene, the gang uncovers a much deeper plot by the 'British Library' to impose a new world order (like we have never seen that before either). There is also the matter of the original papermaster, Yomika Readman, who seems to have disappeared. The storyline is very well written, and it has a real ending, unlike many current and recent anime ""series"" which seem to end in mid air. Try to find it at a decent price. And, if you are a reader, you will not be disappointed.",1291248000,,960,4.641176470588236
