8286298,2,B001C9EELO,"The Andalusian beauty: Maria Jos&eacute; Cantudo had the infamous distinction of being the first to have a nude scene, in a Spanish mainstream film (""La trastienda"" 1975). In ""Marcada por los hombres"" (""Marked by Men"") from 1977, she played a similar character in 'Carmen'. A poor woman with big dreams from a small-town, who made her way to Madrid. There, she met a young man and became pregnant (she contemplated an abortion but could not go through with it. Abortion was illegal in Spain in the 70's). After losing her job and benefits, she returned to her hometown; where she was raped by some local men. Upon returning to Madrid, she was forced into prostitution by a scheming woman and her pimp-boyfriend!

The characters were so one-dimensional, that everything about them was distasteful and predictable (the film is very dated). It was all done in such a male-chauvinistic and clich&eacute;-ridden-way (and yes, Spain at that time was still a very backward place), that it painted a very unrealistic picture/exaggeration of the truth. This was not intended to be an exploitation film, but it could easily have passed for state-propaganda!! The story unfolded in flashbacks: 'Carmen' tormented by the problems of being a single mother (in the puritanical Spain of the 70's), was going to commit suicide in her small apartment (this could be ambiguously interpreted, as the only alternative for single mothers in Spain!). The leaked gas started a fire and Madrid's firefighters rescued her from certain death. She then realized she still had a lot to live and feel hopeful for (her son). The End!! This was the only redeeming value in the whole film.

I would recommend this lost relic to serious collectors, and for the sake of Maria Jos&eacute; Cantudo (She had a very brief nude shower-scene). Thankfully, Maria Jos&eacute; Cantudo is still working, she had a small role in the popular TVE series ""cuentame (como paso)"", and age has been very kind to her. The DVD picture quality is good at best (looks like a VHS transfer). NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 90 mins.

Love and Peace,
