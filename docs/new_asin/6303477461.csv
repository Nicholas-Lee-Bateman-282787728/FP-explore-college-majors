7848136,5,6303477461,Jeff Goldblum is my favorite guy. Tape worked well. A must for JP mavins.,1411084800,,73,4.285714285714286
7848137,5,6303477461,"This tape is a very enjoyable educational piece from the NOVA
series. It's narrated by JEFF GOLDBLUM,with insights from
MICHAEL CRICHTON,JACK HORNER,BOB BAKER,and even STEVEN SPEILBERG.
It was made back in 1995 and gives insights as to how,when,
and where you could bring back genetically created dinosaurs.
While a bit dated. It doe's give a view as to up to that
point in time how you would be able to make,and keep healthy,
genetically created dinosaurs.",1263081600,,457,5.026315789473684
7848138,4,6303477461,"This is a great video to show to high schoool classes when covering the genetics.  It covers many (but not all) of the problems that a scientist would incur while trying to bring a dinosaur to life via DNA.  The three steps in the video include, finding dino-DNA, developing the embryo, and keeping the dinosaur alive (much harder a task than one might think!).  More (and more in depth) information on the problems incured can be found in the book ""The Science of Jurassic Park and the Lost World or, How to Build a Dinosaur"" by Rob DeSalle, Ph. D.  Many problems, from finding the DNA, identifying the species, filling in gaps (frog DNA? PLEASE!!!), finding the appropriate first egg, and much much more.",981504000,6,706,4.669354838709677
