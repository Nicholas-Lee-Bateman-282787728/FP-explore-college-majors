3945926,4,B002LFPBKQ,Good story line and an easy watch. Wonderful area where it was filmed. It has a surprising ending. I would recommend this movie.,1362355200,,128,4.608695652173913
3945927,5,B002LFPBKQ,"I'll admit this film takes its sweet time getting warmed up, but i was satisfied and entertained with a plot that essentially treads familiar ground: Two guys, one girl and a nasty bad guy who threatens their ranch. Of course, they reluctantly join forces to survive and everybody gets in a few jabs along the way. Dean Cain is fun in the role of the stuck up gambler who can't lose.",1333670400,2,383,4.408450704225352
3945928,5,B002LFPBKQ,"This movie is a good slapstick western comedy. You can tell instantly in the beginning of the movie that Shea McCall and BJ Stoker will not get along not because of Liz but just because after Stoomey loses the ranch in an honest card game of Poker. The rest of the movie unfolds in traditional humor with the main lead male characters taking jabs at each other over getting rid of Shea vs. a small affection for Liz. But unfortunately they will need each other to get out of a jam when the banditos destroy Liz's property and they come after Bj's property. The three of them must team up to stop them,only for the boys to battle the Banditos and Liz to get hired hands to protect the ranch. But thanks to a little bang up in the end,they all must band together to begin from scratch. A very humorous way of saying becareful what you say and get involved with.*Edit*note:I loved the Gambler-Shea McCall played by Dean Cain.",1260230400,17,922,4.429411764705883

8372728,5,B002LFPBKQ,Enjoyable and entertaining lighthearted western starring Dean Cain who had never before appeared in a western.  Allison Hassock was charming as the romantic widow.  Worth the purchase!,1504051200,,184,5.777777777777778

I'm a Dean Cain fan and he was great in this as always, he does all parts well in my opinion.  If you like the Western flavor, you'll love it too.",1363132800,,255,3.9411764705882355
