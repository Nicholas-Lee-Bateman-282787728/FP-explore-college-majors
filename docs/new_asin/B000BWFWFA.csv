2443544,5,B000BWFWFA,What more needs to be said? This is a MUST HAVE for the home collection! I also recommend Stewie Griffin; The Untold Story to go along with this DVD Set!,1140739200,,153,4.133333333333334
2443545,3,B000BWFWFA,i am deployed and it is something that i am glad that i have to pass the time by.....,1140739200,,85,3.526315789473684
2443546,5,B000BWFWFA,Great collection it's really great to watch as how the voices and animation progresses from season 1 to the current season. Always as funny and never a let down.,1140652800,,161,4.586206896551724

2443548,5,B000BWFWFA,"I'm not really the animation type.  I usually prefer The Sopranos or something of the like.  However, my fiance loves this show and got me into it.  I must say that it is now one of my favorite shows.  If you like pure comedy, this is for you.  My fiance is going to be happily suprised when he opens this up on Christmas!",1133222400,2,322,4.0476190476190474
2443549,5,B000BWFWFA,"This show is awesome. I just got these, but ordering this pack of all of them doesn't seem to have any advantage over ordering them separately, and separately they are $1.56 cheaper overall. It would have been cooler if there was some case for all 3 volumes or a discount for getting all of them together.",1133136000,13,305,4.464285714285714

Season 3 Aug 2001-Feb 2002

The Thin White Line: A listless Brian gets a job as a police dog due to his uncanny ability to sniff out drugs. Actually, he becomes too good at his job and ends up at a rehab clinic where Peter decides to join him: ""I'm on vacation. Oh, and if they ask, I'm also on smack.""

Brian Does Hollywood: The second part of Thin White Line. Brian goes to LA to find his calling and ends up directing porn. His flamboyant cousin Jasper is hilarious.

Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington: Peter's employer is taken over by a cigarette conglomerate and they make him president of the company. Includes an ""appearance"" by Martha Stewart.

One if by Clam, Two if By Sea: The Brits get it in this episode when they turn the Drunken Clam into a British pub. Great Peter line: ""We kicked your ass in WWII & we can do it again.""

And the Wiener Is: Peter brags about being better than his son at everything, until he sees Chris' extra large manhood.

Death Lives: Peter has Lois go on a scavenger hunt for their wedding anniversary so he can go golfing (great idea!). Features a return of ""Death.""

Lethal Weapons: Lois fears her karate is bringing violence into her home which is a different take from the usual husband is jealous when his wife kicks someone's butt for him storyline.

The Kiss Seen Around the World: Meg becomes an intern at the news station alongside nerdy Neil Goldman. The ""phony""guy was way over used in this one.

Mr. Saturday Knight: With Mr. Weed dead and the toy factory destroyed per his will, Peter pursues his dream of being a jouster at the Renaissance fair. Includes a reference to the Electric Company and Peter as a prostitute is hilarious.

A Fish Out of Water: Peter becomes a fisherman and must kill a legendary man-eating fish to pay off a loan.

Emission Impossible: One of my favorites. Lois & Peter want to have another baby and Stewie sets out to spoil their plans.

To Live & Die in Dixie: Chris identifies a convenience store robber and the family is put in the witness protection program in the Deep South where Chris finds a girlfriend and Stewie discovers a hankering for bluegrass.

Screwed the Pooch: Hilarious episode! Brian impregnates Lois' father's prized race dog and Peter must choose between his best friend and the newly established tolerance his father-in-law shows towards him.

Peter Griffin: Husband, Father...Brother?: Another favorite. Peter discovers a black ancestor who was enslaved by Lois' family and tries to get in touch with his black roots.

Ready, Willing, and Disabled: Joe loses a robber and contemplates leaving the police force until Peter convinces him to enter the Special Person's Games and, like with South Park's take, steroids enter the picture. Great reference to `Touched By an Angel' (""Now where did the angel touch you."").

A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas: After several unfortunate events, Lois goes off the deep end. Hey, let's see an entire KISS Saves Santa!

Brian Wallows and Peter Swallows: As part of his community service, Brian takes care of a mean old hag who ends up having a lot in common with him. This episode is almost touching.

From Method to Madness: The Griffins meet up with a nudist family.

Stuck Together, Torn Apart: Peter's jealousy almost ends his marriage while Stewie and Brian are glued together.

Road to Europe: Stewie is mesmerized by a public television children's show and sets off to England to join it. Meanwhile, Lois and Peter go to Kisstock and Peter is appalled (as would any KISS fan) that Lois does know the words to ""Rock and Roll All Nite.""

Family Guy Viewer Mail #1: Here's hoping there will be a #2. Three tales about Peter becoming a gelatinous blob (its hard to tell the difference...just kidding), the Griffins having superhuman abilities and a ""Little Rascals"" take-off.

When You Wish Upon a Weinstein: Controversial, never-aired episode where Peter hopes to make his son Jewish so he will be successful. (Unaired episode not aired until Dec 2004!)

8093513,5,B000BWFWFA,Still the best seasons of the show mostly the Third season (volume two). I have been particularly disappointed with the newer season both in quality and quantity. The makers got greedy and started releasing half seasons as volumes. So these are hands down the best volumes to own only disappointing thing is there is not commentary tracks on all the episodes just select ones.,1322179200,,376,4.890625

8093516,5,B000BWFWFA,"U cant compare the family guy with Any other cartoon! The Simpsons was good but cant be compared with Family Guy!

Great DVDs!",1168300800,,126,4.478260869565218
8093517,5,B000BWFWFA,"Family Guy a creation by Seth MacFarlane has forever been called a simpsons rip off but truly that is wrong because the originality of this series is unparallel they call it a simpsons rip off because of the dumb big fat father that is Peter Griffin but the similarities stop there as all the characters have their own original quirks.

Lois Griffin: Alright i lied she is the Marge Simpson of family guy but trust me the similarities do stop there. she is the mother of the family and the everlasting bond that keeps them together.

Meg Griffin: The older sister who is so obsessed with her looks and being too fat that it consumes her every being and IMO she is the most boring character in the show.

Chris Griffin: The fat younger brother who is so gullible that he really thinks pigs fly and so stupid that he thinks 2 + 2 is 5 but that's what makes him the funniest member of the family.

Stewie Griffin: The baby of the family who has a bigger IQ than all of them put together. Stewies plot and ever dying wish is to kill his mother for puting him at the bottom of the stupidest family in America.

Brian Griffin: He's the talking dog of the family who has a major crush on Lois but does all he can to try and hide it.

I haven't seen Season 4 yet but i have ordered this DVD set and i am looking foreward to recieving it. I know i won't be disappointed and rest assured you won't be either.",1149724800,,1398,4.197761194029851
8093518,5,B000BWFWFA,"The best comedy show ever. Better even than the almighty South Park, which, in it's later years, is starting to lose it's kick. Too bad. Fortunately, we've got Family Guy. The only thing is, the the fourth season is incomplete. They took a break for a month or two, and released the first half of the season, the second half was thought by many to be season 5, but was actually the latter half of the fourth. When they re-release all the episodes, I'll purchase, that.",1147737600,5,468,4.453488372093023
8093519,5,B000BWFWFA,This show has to be one of my best on [adult swim]. Peter Griffin is such a clown. Their dog name Brian is the smartest of all the family. I love all three volumes box sets.,1146787200,,173,3.8333333333333335
8093520,5,B000BWFWFA,"I'm a huge fan of the this show ever sense they first aired it. I'm so glad that FOX pulled their heads out of their butts and realized what they lost when they took it off the air. Now it's back and better than ever. It has far surpassed the, now running out of ideas, first american family ""The Simpsons."" The only thing for FOX to do next is bring back ""Firefly,"" (which will never happen) and ""Futurama.""",1143936000,2,408,4.243589743589744
