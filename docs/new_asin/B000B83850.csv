8083230,1,B000B83850,"Wow this is so bad it's beyond bad. OK this took all of about $500.00 to make i'm sure. The acting if you can call it that is bad, bad, bad, and where is the story. Ok so there is an accident that is eluded to but except for Adrians character and his g/f how are the others affected? It looks like a high school project film, actually i've seen high school projects that are 100% better than this. Now I see why Adrian, who is a good actor, had to do t.v. almost every movie this man did before Entourage is lousy.",1151366400,5,514,4.0
