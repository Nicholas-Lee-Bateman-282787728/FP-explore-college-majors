7942719,1,B00005K2YJ,"This DVD was released in 2008 but it is 1979 footage! It's not even all action film, you spend time viewing at a bunch of lists. Looks like it was shot with a prehistoric home movie camera, no dialogue. A BIG disappointment. I have been robbed on this purchase.",1282089600,,261,4.346938775510204

7942721,1,B00005K2YJ,"To say this series is bad, is an understatement.  The picture makes it look like a recent production that covers the USAF's history. Not! It is nothing but old promotional clips from the 60's and 70's. If you need a copy, you can find mine in a dumpster.",1253059200,4,254,4.291666666666667
