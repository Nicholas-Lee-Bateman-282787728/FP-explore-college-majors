8108753,5,B000EE9CXI,This video is great!  This is my second copy; bought it on DVD instead of my VHS.  My students loved this movie and there is nothing better than your students actually enjoying a semi-educational film.  It has a story line and inserts snips of van Gogh's life into the film. Do yourself a favor if you are an Art teacher and get a copy.....you will use it year after year.,1319760000,2,372,4.285714285714286
8108754,5,B000EE9CXI,"Vincent and Me held my middle school art students attention on the last two days of school. It is not a biography but a mystery about art forgery with a little fantasy thrown in. It reminds me of ""Goonies"" semi-historical action and clich characters. The film is Canadian but is easy for Midwesterners like my students to relate to.",1275264000,2,332,4.6440677966101696
8108755,5,B000EE9CXI,"I'm glad to have a copy of this again. I saw this once on TV and loved it! While it doesn't really go into Van Gogh's life, it does give a different perspective to those of use to enjoy his work and the way behind it. I truly enjoy this movie and it's great to see that they used Mdme. Calmont for the role of herself. Feisty even at 115, we should all be so lucky.",1224201600,2,365,3.8157894736842106
8108756,5,B000EE9CXI,"I use this DVD to introduce Vincent Van Gogh to my elementary students. This beautiful film holds their interest for a long period of time. An almost impossible task, as any teacher will tell you! This is a children's drama, not a boring documentary. As such, I would classify it as historical fiction. Some of the film's events are based on fact and some are fabricated. At any rate, the acting and cinematography are top notch. I only wish there were other dramatic films about artists  by the same producer and of the same caliber. It also comes in VHS.",1167264000,5,556,4.56
