A doctor caring for Mexican construction workers meets Perla, a camp follower with a big heart, but Dr. Ruben is pining for his wife, who died in a car accident, and he is drinking himself to death. About a third of the way through the story, however, things change for the Doc when one of the workers contracts rabies. Soon Dr. Ruben realizes he has also been exposed to the disease. The rabies sequence on which the plot turns is, in my opinion, one of the most realistic and terrifying depictions of rabies Ive ever seen on film. The rest of the show builds the suspense as Dr. Ruben encounters obstacle after obstacle in his bid to get rabies shots within 48 hours. If you like movies with drama and suspense, this one is for you.",1447977600,2,874,4.401234567901234

It is one of those movies that linger in the back of your mind like a sleeper cell,one day to awake. I honestly do not remember much about it except that I thought it was pretty cool. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Glenn Ford. He seems underated,but lets not forget about Gilda and 3:10 to Yuma,among many other great performances. Worth watching,and just look at that poster!",1229644800,6,554,4.55
