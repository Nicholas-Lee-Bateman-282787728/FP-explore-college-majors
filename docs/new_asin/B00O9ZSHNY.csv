6729747,3,B00O9ZSHNY,Ok show,1455580800,,7,3.0
6729748,4,B00O9ZSHNY,"I enjoy that this is a collaborative cooking show where there isn't a stupid timer or chefs running around a storeroom or grocer in a frenzy.  In fact, here we often get to meet the purveyors and even see them enjoy the penultimate meal.  Cool stories and a nice mix of cooking with biography, local interest, and energy.  Some of it gets kind of kitsch and sometimes feels overly scripted, and the tagline is bland but easily skipped.  I reckon it would improve in season 2.",1454976000,,475,4.488372093023256

6729752,4,B00O9ZSHNY,"The show is entertaining and the food looks gorgeous, but a lot of it is unusual, found only in certain parts of the country or difficult to obtain.  Recipes are laborious and most are not geared for the home chef.  Some episode recipes are totally approachable, but not many.  They often go into private or wholesale organic gardens,have access to rare, tropical fruit or unusual mushrooms, herbs or fruits.",1453680000,,408,4.884057971014493

6729755,4,B00O9ZSHNY,"This is a fun cooking show put on by PBS with a nice rapport among the participants, but inaccurately named.  The show focuses on cooking extremely local foods, sometimes caught or harvested in the morning and cooked at night.  It is therefore totally immovable as these meals could not be prepared anywhere but in the locality featured --which is the point of the show.  Aside from that it features some good chefs from different places in the U.S.that you may not have heard of before cooking their signature dishes or otherwise making use of the special ingredients they have available from the region they are in.  The show is also somewhat a travel log or at least spotlight on some locations in the U.S. you might want to visit for food or beauty.  The forced insertion of the same quote regarding ""Moveable Feast"" as the party sits down to eat the dishes cooked gets a little tiring, particularly given its inaccuracy.",1448236800,2,925,4.720496894409938

6729811,4,B00O9ZSHNY,"It is typical fare from PBS. since I do watch a lot of PBS so this was something that I normally watch. I found some of it interesting but after a while, some of the host is just too cute for me.",1429142400,,195,3.6666666666666665

6729815,2,B00O9ZSHNY,"It is ok, but why do most of these type shows act like there is nothing in the US that is more than 100 Miles from the east or west coast?  There is a lot more than the sea ports here you know.",1428192000,,193,3.488372093023256
6729816,3,B00O9ZSHNY,"Some episodes are more interesting than the other.  So far the San Francisco episode was the most disappointing, 3rd rate chefs, using dried galangal and talking about fresh.  PLEASE.",1427846400,,183,5.275862068965517
6729817,5,B00O9ZSHNY,I love the format.  Pete does a great job as host.,1427241600,,50,3.5454545454545454

6729820,4,B00O9ZSHNY,"Makes me hungry to watch chefs cook delicious, local foods in such creative ways.  I love that the local farmers get ""top billing"" in that they can get to talk about what they do and they pride they take in their produce, animals, etc.",1426032000,,235,4.340909090909091

6729824,3,B00O9ZSHNY,"The show is pretty great in all respects, except that I can count the number of women and non-white people featured on one hand for the entire first season. I expect better from PBS - if you serve the public, you should represent the public.",1425081600,,241,4.377777777777778

6729839,4,B00O9ZSHNY,It's nice how the show takes you to a different region each time. Seeing the diversity of styles in cooking we have in the US is great. It's nice to see others with the same passion for great food!,1424390400,,197,4.076923076923077
6729840,4,B00O9ZSHNY,I like everything about this show except for the stupid Hemingway quote at the end of every episode.  It is very corny...,1424390400,,121,4.5
6729841,3,B00O9ZSHNY,"This show has a great premise. I like being taken behind the scenes on host and chef curated meals for intimate parties. I love being exposed to chefs around the country, local fare and meal/preparation ideas.

Two aspects I find cheesy and clumsy is the quote that is repeated at the end of Every episode on film, and some parts of the cinematography. I like the quote and how it ties into the show title and theme, but as a viewer it becomes redundant hearing it because I'm not sitting at the table. The cinematography is really beautiful, but sometimes it seems there's some sort of double-vision blur. At times there is a film strip effect with several videos at once scrolling on the screen. The combination of these two effects make me dizzy watching the show. And yes, for you smart allecs out there, my prescription is up to date! There is an episode or two where the sound effects are poor and seemed the mic wasn't around while filming the segment which made it hard to hear the host and chefs. If you can get past these distractions, the content is well-worth any foodie's time!",1420588800,,1090,4.532994923857868
