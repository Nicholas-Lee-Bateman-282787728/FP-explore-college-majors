8329063,1,B001O2ZVZC,"What a horrible movie. So boring, so slow. Sound was awful too. Can't recommend this at all. Unless you like boring slow movies that sound awful.",1415491200,,145,4.615384615384615
8329064,4,B001O2ZVZC,"one of the most odd movies ever made, but was extremely mental with the camera work and slow pace made it seem real. it was over 2 hours long, that was the only problem it took along time for the story to develop, but if you have 2 hours to kill and like cult movies,  I think it was really good for a wicked mind game :p",1388016000,3,321,3.791044776119403
8329065,1,B001O2ZVZC,"Don't be a fool,be careful with others reviews posted , don't throw your money ,this is a very bad film ,low picture quality, terrible scenography,it looks like an very old one,,,,,conclution:this movie is amazingly bad.",1239408000,2,220,5.314285714285714
8329066,5,B001O2ZVZC,"When I first picked up this movie from a table at a horror convention thought I was picking up just another thriller film with bad acting and a poor plot. Instead it turns out I bought a very good thriller with good acting and a good classic plot.

The story is that a guy who has a lot of debts joins a secret society and receives a large amount of money. If only he follows the rules he will have a good life, if only....

Just like their earlier film Shadow Brook ""Phil Thomas"" & ""Matt Brooks"" did a great job with a limited budget. This is a must see movie for those who love thrillers.",1237161600,,590,4.077586206896552
8329067,5,B001O2ZVZC,"False Face appears like a film made with very limited budget. However, the lack of budget has not restricted the filmmakers, Phil Thomas and Matt Brooks, in providing an outright entertainer.

Lead and supporting actors - Kris Miller, Seregon O'Dassey, Dan Van Wert, and Bourke Floyd have acted very well, unlike typical acting we see in low budget movies.

Phil and Matt have proven they stand above the rest.",1235952000,2,410,4.927536231884058
8329068,5,B001O2ZVZC,"If you are a fan of movies such as Black Christmas(not the remake),Rosemary's Baby, or Race With the Devil you should enjoy False Face.  The film places a great deal of emphasis on suspense and mood.  This is a movie that allows the viewer to use his or her imagination rather then being spoon-fed plot points. I also believe for the most part the acting is much better then most indie horror movies.",1234137600,,400,4.465753424657534
