Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ... ""The Cariboo Trail"" (1950), ""The Nevadan"" (1950), ""Colt .45"" (1950), ""Santa Fe"" (1951), ""Sugarfoot"" (1951), ""Fort Worth"" (1951), ""Man in the Saddle"" (1951), ""Carson City"" (1952), ""The Man Behind the Gun"" (1952), ""Hangman's Knot"" (1952), ""Thunder over the Plains"" (1953), ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" (1953), ""Ten Wanted Men"" (1954), ""Riding Shotgun"" (1954), ""The Bounty Hunter"" (1954), ""Rage at Dawn"" (1955), ""Tall Man Riding"" (1955), ""A Lawless Street"" (1955), ""Seven Men from Now"" (1956), ""Seventh Cavalry"" (1956), ""Decision at Sundown: (1957), ""Shoot-Out at Medicine Bend"" (1957), ""The Tall T"" (1957), ""Buchanan Rides Alone"" (1958), ""Ride Lonesome"" (1959), ""Westbound"" (1959),  ""Comanche Station"" (1960) --- Scott's age seemed to matter little, they only came to see another Randolph Scott film and always got their money's worth --- Scott's films were good and getting better becoming classics --- so if you ever wonder ""What Ever Happened To Randolph Scott"", just rent or purchase one of his films and you'll see he's never left us.

739360,4,6303935494,If you like westerns and especially if you like Randolf Scott you will enjoy Abilene Town.  Being in B&W makes it like a documnetary on the growth of our nation.  Yet this movie does have action and lessons to be learned without all of the blood and guts that the current movies like to show; and yes it does have a happy ending.  This is a movie you can watch with your kids to give them an opportunity to see how the west was won.,1151884800,3,432,4.0588235294117645
739361,4,6303935494,"Smart and briskly told, ABILENE TOWN is an above-average homesteader vs. cattle rancher movie.  Randolph Scott stars as the town marshal of Abilene who finds himself in the middle of a land war.  Short of only John Wayne, Scott is the man for the task.  The movie opens with Scott in church, singing hymns with the angelic Rhonda Fleming.  The pious music is interrupted by the sound of gunfire.  The cattle drovers are in town, shooting up the honey pots.

  Check that - they're shooting up-wards in the saloons, more in emphatic syncopation with song and dance girl Ann Dvorak's act that in meanness.  The wranglers and ramrods are saving that meanness for act two, when the hymn singing, sodbusting homesteaders arrive and begin planting houses and barb-wiring up the northern terminus of the Abilene Trail.  That levels out their aim some.

  ABILENE TOWN is about the tension of opposites, with Randolph Scott smack in the middle.  His character is a failed rancher who sympathizes with the ""decent life"" desiring homesteaders.  He has to chose between Good Girl Rhonda Fleming and Bad Girl (with a heart of gold) Ann Dvorak.  The movie also pits the merchants against the saloons, cattle against wheat, the pious against the profane.  It's a contest between a restoration of the status quo and the establishment of a new order.

  With its strong story, straight-ahead direction, and solid cast, ABILENE TOWN is a treat.  Scott is well within his competent comfort zone as the man with the badge, Edgar Buchanan and Ann Dvorak leaven things with amusing diversions, and a young Lloyd Bridge is effective as the firebrand leader of the sodbusters.  Hired thug Chet Younger, played by the underrated Jack Lambert, burns enough barns and shoots enough defenseless women and children to keep our sympathies from straying over to the wrong side of the fence.  The transfer print on the review copy was faded out some, which tends to flatten out the picture.  Nothing major.  Otherwise it's in good shape, a real bargain considering its deeply discounted price.

  ABILENE TOWN is a classic western that will delight fans of the genre and quite possibly hold the attention of non-converts as well.",1098576000,16,2198,4.9316939890710385
739362,4,6303935494,"This film is interesting because it shows how a city that was built and that prospered thanks to the driving of cattle from the SouthWest to the Middle West becomes a farming town. The fight between the drovers and the homesteaders is very well depicted, with its killings when the drovers deem it necessary to impose their domination. But the city is cut in two. On one side of the street the saloons. On the other side of the street the shops. The change comes when the homesteaders cut the trail with their barbed wire and when the shopkeepers understand that there is more money on the homesteaders' side than on the drovers'. The drovers push their last pawns, with the support at first of the saloonkeepers. But it means killing some homesteaders and the local marshall  opposes it and imposes law and order. The drovers are driven out of the city. The city becomes a farming city and Kansas moves from a state that is crossed by herds of cattle to a farming state. This is possible, though never really said, because the railroads make it feasible to transport the cattle from Texas to Illinois without having to cross any farmland any more. But this future is made a reality because of the alliance of the shopkeepers with the homesteaders. We thus are shown history in its making.

739679,5,6303935494,"This review is of the Panamint Cinema blu-ray release of ABILENE TOWN. Several of the earlier reviews are apparently of other editions, and the Panamint release is leagues above and better than any of those earlier releases.  First, this blu-ray release is all regions and plays perfectly in American blu-ray players. And the quality is simply superb black & white, the best by far that I've ever seen in thirty years of collecting this elusive gem from 1946. Panamint has found a pristine 35mm copy, and the transfer is magnificent. Panamint also includes a nice booklet, with all sorts of details about the film, its production, its actors, and so on.

American viewers---fans of Randolph Scott, those who enjoy good classic Western cinema, and anyone interested in fine film-making from the 1940s---should have no hesitation in purchasing the Panamint blu-ray release. After seventy years of absence, ABILENE TOWN has been restored to its rightful place in the Randy Scott canon. Thank you, Panamint!",1455926400,,1003,5.147239263803681

739754,5,6303935494,"There are some good and bad things about Abilene Town, but overall I thought is was a good movie.  Randolph Scott plays a no nonsense Marshall in a town that doesn't know what it wants, routy cattlemen, or farmers.  The County Sheriff played by Edgar Buchanan is nothing but scared little man who takes credit for everything the Marshall does.

Randolph knows how to act and plays his roll well.  Although he didn't ride off into the sunset with the lady star I thought he would in this movie.  He picked Ann Dvorak, who played Rita, the owner of the dancehall tavern, and Lloyd Bridges got the girl I thought Randolph Scott would get.  It was nice to see Lloyd Bridges in something other than Sea Hunt.  I give the movie 5 stars, but an overall grade of A-.

I like to remember Randolph Scott as the Statler Brothers did in the song ""Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott"".  Check it out!

The story begins with a herd of white-faced cattle in a valley in 1870. A thousand miles of cattle trails stretched from Texas ranges to the railroad yards of Abilene Kansas. The cowboys would get paid, they celebrated like sailors who came off a long voyage. One side of town had the saloons and places that catered to young men who wanted a good time. Shots are fired. The town has two rules for visiting cowboys: check your guns with the bartender, and don't cross Texas Street (the decent part of town). The saloons attract trail-hands, their cash makes the town prosperous. Settlers arrive in town. Homesteaders are not wanted by the cattlemen. A cowboy argues with a gambler, and loses again. The Town Supervisor appoints the Town Marshal to keep things peaceful as the dollars roll in.

Sheriff Bravo Tremble has a different attitude from the Marshal. Someone robbed the train? What can the Sheriff do? The Homesteaders are mostly from Ohio, they came for the government land. They will work the land and produce crops. [No comment on the economy and depression of that era.] The Sheriff visits a saloon, its owner worried about his future economy. A man shoots at the Marshal, then hides in the theater. We hear another song and see dancing girls. Rats in the basement? A long dull evening? The Marshal visits a rooming house for young women. Rita loves her life. Outside of town riders burn out a settler, and shoot a man. Then they attack the settler's camp. [Economic warfare?] Who wants to drive the settlers away? One of the riders was recognized: Jeff Younger. The Marshal visits the saloon, and is offered a job by Charlie.

Sheriff Bravo forms a posse to search for the killer. Three deputies left in the night; their heart wasn't in it. Marshal Mitchell has a clue, but the Sheriff is in command. ""We do it for the exercise."" Sheriff Bravo plays cards with a sod buster. ""Let's deal again."" The Town Marshal captures Jeff alive to bring him back to town. The Sheriff looks for votes! The people cheer his return. There is another song. Mitchell visits Rita. But Jeff escaped from jail with a gun. What will the Sheriff do? Marshall Dan ends it. Will Abilene ever change? [The construction of a railroad into Texas ended the long trail drives.] Shelly says Dan loves his job too much. [Power?] The homesteaders must organize to fight for their rights by fencing their lands with barbed wire.

Is it a crime to work hard for yourself? [No receipt?] The cattle stampede past the fences, and destroy what is in their way. Who sold the wire? Mr. Boulder does the math: 500 families will generate more sales than from cowboys. Marshal Dan closes the saloons. Charlie hesitates. Riker's gang arrives to break into the saloons. Shelly can handle a gun. ""I'm proud of you."" Sheriff Tremble will lead the men, who sing as they march. A wide open town? Marshal Dan tries to arrest Riker. The cowboys are told to ride out of town peaceably. The fight is over, the townspeople won.

This was adapted from the novel ""Trail Town"" by Ernest Haycox. It has songs, romance, action, comedy, and economic conflict. It is slightly less than first rate.",1394755200,,3173,4.689407540394973

740009,5,6303935494,"Corny? Square? Dated? Absolutely but it's Randolph Scott, Kansas lawman, trying to hold the town together while traditional cattlemen are at odds with ""progressive"" homesteaders. As if that weren't enough he has two women to contend with (Rhonda Fleming & Ann Dvorak). Lloyd Bridges is point man for homesteaders and Jack Lambert makes a great gunman for the cattlemen but it's Edgar Buchanan who steals the show. This 89 minute B & W oater from 1946 is under the promo banner of ""NOTHING BUT GUNS, GUTS AND GLORY"" but rest easy it's entertainment suitable for the whole family. They don't make 'em like this anymore and in my opinion that's a shame!",1390953600,4,650,4.8125
740010,4,6303935494,"A perfect metaphor of waning values this film captures the values America had when it was struggling to find who and what it was. And who better to portray good that Randolph Scott a wholesome icon of pure goodness. As in all his films the bad guys are always bad, real bad. The cast did an excellent job and take a look at a young Llyod Bridges. If that's not enough, there is always at least one woman tugging at our heartstrings and his. Then there are the scared, the wimps, and the dubious (as in the townsfolk of High Noon). This one has a nice touch of theater, music, and dancing to make very realistic saloons. Balancing it all out makes for a good movie and this one does it well - right down to the crummy re-editing, original poor quality of the film itself, and lighting. This is entertainment chock full of messages, once important messages, once known as values - honesty, integrity, decency, looking out for one another, having the courage of conviction, and loyalty. The very values that have faded from our American culture and society just like the wild west faded from the lawlessness and in that, the metaphor. Recommended especially for Scott fans.

740073,5,6303935494,"This is an ""Oldie,but Goodie"" Old West Western that came out in 1946;and is a Classic in every sense of the word. It's hard to believe it is now 64 years old, but it is just as good a watch now as it was then. We are a little spoiled with all the fantastic color,music,and special effects with the movies of today;but the storyline,characters,action,and even the camera work and B&W are so good that it can't be ovrshadowed with the advancements of today.
  Three great actors of the time, Randolph Scott,Rhonda Flemming,Ann Dvorak,and Edgar Butman along with Lloyd Bridges,an upcoming star at the time, all gave stellar pergformances.
 This film deals with a time,1870, when great changes were sweeping across the Old West. The great Trail Drives of cattle from Texas to Abilene, Kanswas,a trek of over a thousand miles ,following trails across ""open ranges"" was coming to an end. The construction of the Railroads,and the settling of the ranges by Homesteaders,and the erection of barbed wire fences,virtually overnight spelled the end of cattle drives. Not only the drives ended,but also great changes were in store for the ""wild cattle towns"",the whole way of life for the merchants and townspeople,were changed ,but not without great resistance.
 It's often been said that there are no great writers today;because those who know anything ,can't write;and those who can write don't know anything. I guess one can also say the same about movie makers.
 Either way,if you are looking for a good Old West Western,and disappointed with what the movie industry is serving up these days;go back and check out some of these B&W Classics. There are many to choose from.",1285372800,2,1665,4.974820143884892

740078,4,6303935494,"This brisk and lively western is based on Ernest Haycock's fine novel ""Trail Town"" and is essentially a scaled down version of the classic 1939 Western ""Dodge City"",having a script built along similar lines .
It is a town taming tale in which Randolph Scott plays a tough lawman ,charged with the task of restoring order to Abilene,a cattle town at the end of the Chisholm Trail .Abilene is riven with conflict between cattlemen and homesteaders and Scott needs to tackle the corruption endemic within certain sections of the cattle interest while striving to ensure that the hotheaded and fiery leader of the homesteaders( Lloyd Bridges)does not inflame the situation so badly that widespread violence is inevitable .and that saner counsels previal .He still finds time for amorous dalliance with two opposite women -the ""nice,respectable""girl (Rhonda Fleming)and the wisecracking saloon gal (Ann Dvorak).The latter character has echoes of Dietrich in Destry Rides Again

This was the first of several movies pairing Scott and director Edward L Marin ,a partnership ended by the death of the director in 1951 .It is a tough ,fast moving and unpretentious movie with decent performances - I especilaly liked the  droll cameo from Edgar Buchanan aa a lawmam who would rather booze than fight -and a tight script by Harold Shumale ,allied to punchy direction keeps things moving briskly throughout

This is a robust unpretentious movie that will be admired by Western fans particularly",1193529600,4,1483,5.196652719665272
