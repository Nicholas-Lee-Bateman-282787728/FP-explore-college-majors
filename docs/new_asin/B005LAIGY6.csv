4729082,2,B005LAIGY6,"Let me say first that I agree with a lot of what the other reviewers have said both good and bad. The audience was quite happy with this movie, and it made for a nice date. It's a piece of fluff -- but it's bad fluff. Now, wait, I was going to give the good parts first.  Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy.  Some funny bits, like the paintball scene, the way each guy spoils the other's dates.  That's about it.  I'd add Chelsea Handler for a couple of funny remarks, but I really don't see what she's doing in the movie. Uh, and the cinematography is often very good. That's about it.

The bad parts are really, really bad. For the romcom format, this is a disaster. There is no chemistry between Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon. I mean, when McG has to mount a kitchen counter to show Pine and Witherspoon how to do foreplay, you know there's a problem. There is no chemistry between Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon, either. Uh, I forgot another good thing: the chemistry between Pine and Hardy is great; they play off of each other (think Eames and Arthur in Inception)with genuine comedic talent. Which is surprising given their out of the box casting. I'd read that both men wanted to add some fluff to their resumes but they're wasted here. What they need is a vehicle that has a good script and a good director. Reese Witherspoon did the Oscar-winning June Carter Cash role years ago, and the Legally Blonde thing even longer than that. McG says she wanted to show off her sexy side here. That may have something to do with the zero chemistry thing. Plot problems: the premise is weak. Two incompetent covert-operations agents have been grounded, and so they play around with surf-dating. Would you believe -- they both fall for the same woman! Complication: they are closer than brothers, than partners, they ""would take a bullet"" for each other. However, when the time comes to test this bond, the men become twelve-year-olds and begin a series of gotcha/gotcha-back stunts. The plot has a lot of holes in it. What's Chelsea Handler doing in the movie? She provides nothing to fill out Witherspoon's character or to move the plot forward. She's given some witty impromptu lines. What's the bad-guy thing doing here? It's superfluous and badly done. The action scenes could certainly work with the stunts the two agents pull. And why is Angela Bassett in this movie? OMG The amount of wasted talent is humongous. McG's direction is, is, invisible. There is no direction here. All three of the actors try to build something with Legos, but McG insists on tearing it down.  As a director, he shoots good videos.

 Now for the worst criminal of all for the movie: the screenwriter(s). Let me start with the story's ending. It's ridiculous. ""Don't choose the better man,"" Handler tells her, ""choose the man who will make you better."" Is she kidding? Reese does choose one of the men, but lest the audience feel cheated for the fate of the other -- kind of ruining the romcom's happy, satisfying ending-- he is given something to look forward to without Reese. I'd say he's the guy who really wins the ""war."" I read an interview where Hardy and Pine suggest writing an ending which would have been far more satisfying, not to say really funny, but McG nixed it. He did say, though, that there would be an alternate ending on the dvd. If the dvd sells for three bucks, I'll buy it for that. (And Tom Hardy. Did I mention him?)  Oh, this is supposed to be the bad stuff. The screenwriter(s) must have been on crack. Or were paid two bucks a page. Will Smith and Reese produced this, and you'd think they'd have burned the script after reading it. Witherspoon has mentioned that when she thought one or another of the scenes ""wasn't working,"" she'd change it. I mean, she admitted that. Whoa. The dialogue is not good enough to be called cliched. It's embarrassing. Since its release, both Pine and Hardy have had the charity to damn it with faint praise. Good for them. There is no cohesive story; the plot is choppy and some scenes gratuitous. It's like a string of miscellaneous scenes that someone forgot to edit.

Verdict: So-freaking-so. Have a couple of drinks before seeing this. Suspend all disbelief. Do not expect a good romcom. Do not expect comedic performances. Think back to your high-school days and the people you knew then, the popular girl, the sweet nerd, the jock, in an impossible triangle. Did you like them then?  You won't like them now, either. Save your money instead of seeing this on the big screen. Rent the dvd, pop some corn, cuddle up on the sofa, and enjoy the fluff. Just don't expect it to be good fluff. In the meantime, rent a good Hepburn-Tracy movie if you want an intelligent romcom -- and a really funny one.",1330041600,16,4738,4.595266272189349
4729083,5,B005LAIGY6,"I am 13 and I am a big movie freak, I watch classic movies like Casablanca, Breakfast at Tiffanys, The Apartment and many more movies made in the 1900's (that I really love) and I liked this movie alot. Tom Hardy, Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon played their roles terrifically. Chris Pine is ""the Womanizer"", Tom Hardy ""the nice Romantic guy"" and Reese Witherspoon is ""the Perfect Woman"". It is a great comedy/romance/action movie that I think will be the in the top of my movies for a long time. I would recommend this

4729084,2,B005LAIGY6,"My bias...

Loves: Action movies.
Likes: Tom Hardy
Dislikes: Most romantic comedies
Hates: Reese Witherspoon

I went into this movie with low expectations.  First off, it's got Reese Witherspoon, who I can't stand.  She's annoying, smarmy and unattractive.  Second, it's directed by McG, who for my tastes, misses in theaters (the Charlie's Angels series, Terminator Salvation).  That being said, I know McG has the potential to entertain me, having produced one of my favorite TV shows of all time, the guilty pleasure known as Fastlane.  My expectations were checked at the door.

Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play off of each other quite well.  Tom Hardy I bought as a CIA agent, in terms of attitude and build.  Pine, not as much.  Reese Witherspoon is just kind of...there...as the love interest.  The story is fairly cookie-cutter like one may expect going in...two CIA agents accidentally kill a bad guy.  That bad guy's brother lives, and plots revenge.  In the meantime, the two CIA agents start dating the same girl, causing friction in their relationship.  The story is nothing new, but is adequate.

They are marketing this movie as an action/romantic comedy.  The action in the movie is done very poorly - mostly quick cuts and off screen bullet wounds (for examples of how action scenes should be shot, see Haywire).  The action set pieces are few and short.  There are a few laughs, although the severely over the top character Chelsea Handler plays gets old quick.  The ending of the movie is quite ridiculous, and makes little sense...sadly, I saw what was going to happen about a mile away, so if you see a lot of movies, you can see where the movie is heading.

I don't regret seeing this movie, but I probably won't watch it again.  The action isn't gratifying enough and the comedy isn't funny enough.  You will forget about this movie within 24 hours of seeing it.

Score: 2 stars.",1329868800,3,1899,4.790123456790123
4729085,4,B005LAIGY6,"When two CIA agents find themselves vying for the same woman, their rivalry is epic! Lucky Reese Witherspoon, to be one-third of an eternal triangle with these guys!

Director McG (""Terminator Salvation,"" and ""Chuck"") certainly knows how to open a film with a bang and never slow down. Even though this is a romantic comedy, CIA activities and skirmishes are couched in enough reality that we invest a little skin in the game. But the banter and camaraderie between two hunky heroes keep it cartoony and light. Furthermore, the conversations between our heroine and her best friend are hilarious, particularly when they are being overheard by the guys.

  * Reese Witherspoon (""Water for Elephants"") tests products and facilitates focus groups, but she hasn't quite recovered from her last break-up. Her best friend offers sage advice that positively drips with envy.
  * Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") is the smooth man about town, a CIA-trained lady killer with blue eyes you could get lost in. Problem is, Reese isn't about to fall. She may be tempted, but she won't fall. ...maybe....oops....
  * Tom Hardy (""Inception"") is the third side of this triangle, who pretends to be a travel agent, which contributed to the end of his marriage. Now he's competing with Chris Pine for Reese's affections and not doing too badly, either, despite being British...
  * Chelsea Handler (lots of TV) is the best friend who keeps offering Reese all that bad, bad advice. She's so funny I'd probably try her suggestions, too! Hey, don't Volkswagens have air bags?

Once again we are confronted with a PG-13 film that is fairly anatomical, but it's so funny I guess I'll forgive them. The clever script is loaded with double entendres that had us laughing out loud (""the agent has entered the premises""). To watch Hollywood's version of the high-tech power the CIA can bring into this testosterone-laden rivalry is really fun! Plus, I've never seen Ms. Witherspoon so relaxed or funny before.

Expect no sweaty bodies, a snippet of profanity, lots of gunfire, some bloody fisticuffs, a bit of exciting vehicular mayhem, and even some blowie uppie stuff. Our happy audience made a LOT of noise as we left the theater. This should do very well, because it's good old-fashioned entertainment, no socially redeeming qualities, just silly fluffy fun. Amazon.com will notify me when the DVD is available.",1329782400,77,2380,4.99746835443038
4729086,4,B005LAIGY6,"That plenty of folks are slamming the kabonkers out of this film reinforces that old saw about how mileage may vary, how people's tastes tend to blanket the spectrum. I happen to like THIS MEANS WAR and, to go by how the theater audience kept erupting in chuckles, I have got like-minded peeps out there.

Given, the premise is ridiculous. The plot is pure escapism. And the writer(s) doesn't really dedicate much thought into the espionage stuff. Til Schweiger plays the menacing but ill-defined international big bad, except that he's pretty much an afterthought. And a plot advancer.

Whether or not you enjoy the movie will depend on how much you like the three leads. Me, I relish the hell out of all three. They make the film watchable and fun. Because of their appeal, the comedy bits and the romantic bits work for me. The plot ventures another case of a woman getting in the way of a perfectly fine bromance. FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy), an English gent, are CIA operatives who happen to be best friends. FDR, cool and refined, and Tuck, not as cool or refined, would take a bullet for each other. When they discover that they're dating the same woman, they even shake on a gentleman's agreement. Should romantic developments threaten their friendship, they agree to walk away from the woman.

Except it's hard to walk away from Reese Witherspoon. She plays Lauren Scott, a lead product evaluator for a consumer research company. Lauren is expert with charts and numbers but unlucky in love. When prodded to go play the field by her married best friend (a raunchy Chelsea Handler whose dialogue had to be toned down for the film to earn a PG-13 rating), Lauren protests and breaks down the hazards of going out on a blind date (such as ending up in the trunk of a car or being carved into a skin suit by some maniac). The next day Lauren is horrified to learn that her best friend had put up a provocative profile of her on an online dating service.

It's amusing to me that Tuck's being an Englishman works against his favor; it's usually not like that. His British descent is actually what Lauren singles out when she lists his faults to her B.F.F. (this fault becomes a running joke, as does FDR's own shortcoming). Tuck is more reserved than FDR (who is an unrepentant womanizer), and it's Tom Hardy's performance that grounds the film for whatever stretch the film is grounded. How can you not feel for a bloke what dotes on his young son and (at least in the film's beginning) pines for his ex-wife? As for Chris Pine, sorry but I've already pigeonholed him as the new Captain Kirk, and I can't help but note the Kirkness trying to emerge even in this secret agent role. Mind you, I find it all very entertaining.

Much of the film centers around Lauren's progressive dates with both gentlemen, and how Tuck and FDR gradually escalate their rivalry even as their friendship crumbles. The spy versus spy stuff gets a real working over as the two spooks keep one-upping and sabotaging each other. I did think that the sprinklers gambit and the trank dart (both shown in the trailer) were played out. If this were real life, I'd be horrified with their misappropriation of CIA personnel and their rampant misuse of hi-tech CIA surveillance equipment, all to keep tabs on Lauren and unearth her innermost secrets. And for experienced CIA agents, Tuck and FDR aren't that keen to keep things on the covert. That gentleman's agreement lasted all of not a hell of a long time.

But this is escapism in cinema, and so I brushed off them nagging impressions. THIS MEANS WAR succeeds on the strength of Hardy, Pine, and Witherspoon, all three of whom I thought worked with terrific chemistry in whatever combination the story threw them in. If you liked TRUE LIES and MR. & MRS. SMITH, THIS MEANS WAR shares that same spirit and sensibility, although the action sequences, unfortunately, tend to fall along the more generic lines. But I was reeled in by the romantic beats. Somewhere in the exaggerated plot twists and broad humor and frenetic shootouts on freeways and in posh Hong Kong skyscrapers, I found myself actively rooting for all three characters. I can't be the only one, can I?",1329696000,11,4205,4.668016194331984
4729087,3,B005LAIGY6,"""This Means War"" would be the perfect date movie if it had a better screenplay, but it still has something for both genders. It has beautifully shot and choreographed action scenes, it has beautiful leads characters, it has romance and it maintains a fun pace throughout. Director McG (Charlies Angels & Terminator Salvation) is an experienced action director, and he should have had and still could have a gold mine idea with ""This Means War"".

 The movie is essentially a Spy vs. Spy storyline with a girl in between. The problem is, they didn't do anything particularly creative with the creative idea. Two long time friends and CIA operatives, Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine) spend most of their lives embroiled in deep secret government operations, so there is no time for love. Lauren, (Reese Witherspoon) spends most of her time embroiled in her work as a product tester. When the three of them find each other, separately, the competition for Lauren's affection begins.

 ""This Means War"" is pure fun. If you start to think about the things happening in the movie, you're going to ruin it for yourselves. For instance, the fact that the two CIA operatives have basically tapped and wired every aspect of Lauren's life, or are using their skills to slither through her apartment while she's popping popcorn, is a little disturbing. It's a good thing they are good looking celebrities, because most men would be shot and/or locked up for such things.

 All in all though, ""This Means War"" is a fun time at the movies. You will laugh and you will be entertained, but you won't be challenged by the cookie-cutter and highly predictable screenplay that doesn't twist or turn. It maybe would have faired better had the movie incorporated the villan, Heinrich (Til Schweiger), into the storyline more than just the beginning and the end. The fact that the two CIA operatives were on a job and could have been putting their love interest in a lot of danger never became an issue and if it had, it would have been a better movie.",1329609600,3,2034,4.764204545454546
4729088,2,B005LAIGY6,"McG hasn't really been seen in the director's chair since Terminator Salvation hit theaters back in 2009. Audiences were split as to whether they actually enjoyed Salvation or not as critics hated it and the movie failed to make back its budget in its domestic gross. So what's the logical next step after doing a movie about the nuclear holocaust and the ongoing war between humans and humanoid machines? You could probably guess the action bit, but the romantic comedy part would probably throw you off.

This Means War is the story of FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) two CIA agents who are two of the best agents in their field. FDR and Tuck are partners and best friends, but come to a gentleman's agreement when they both start dating the same woman named Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). Both FDR and Tuck begin falling for Lauren and not only begin breaking the rules that they set for one another, but use whatever means necessary to keep Lauren in their good graces.

This Means War throws you right into one of FDR and Tuck's missions right from the start. The main issue becomes how dizzying the camera work is. The action hits extremely hard and is incredibly fast paced, but you have a difficult time actually following just what is transpiring in these quick cuts let alone trying to keep your wits about you. This is kind of odd since I wasn't a fan of Terminator Salvation, but felt like one of its strongest qualities was how the camera always seemed to be in the right place during the action. Maybe McG decided to regress back to his Charlie's Angels mindset for This Means War.

The action heavy romantic comedy is dragged down by annoying girl talk. Lauren and her friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) do nothing but whine and complain about their lives the entire movie while also revealing they're basically the most promiscuous girls around. This Means War paints this picture of women that they all date multiple guys at once and will put out just to try and make a decision. It's pretty demeaning to women in general. Between Lauren and Trish's talks of the size of a man's private parts or a lightning round involving sex, every inch of dialogue between them is unbearable right from the start. Meanwhile, FDR and Tuck have quite a bit of immature bickering between one another as well. It becomes borderline homophobic at times and just feels very third grade for nearly half of the film. The second half becomes a little easier to digest and the highlight comes when FDR mocks Tuck's British accent.

The storyline is very imbecilic, as well. Using the gadgets, technology, and basically every ounce of intelligence of the CIA to try and win over a woman is just asinine. The actual mission, which is certainly more interesting than the love triangle you're forced to endure, isn't even second fiddle. It's more like the third or fourth subplot of the movie. The FDR/Tuck/Lauren love triangle being the primary, FDR/Tuck's friendship falling apart being the secondary, Lauren trying to mull things over with Trish being the third, and Tuck trying to be a stand up family man the fourth. So that would make the actual mission the fifth subplot of the movie. How lame is that?

This Means War does get a little less irritating as it progresses. The jokes get slightly less offensive and Tom Hardy still manages to be the best part of the movie. While Reese Witherspoon has to make it a point to try and jiggle around while wearing horrible clothes and singing off key and Chris Pine attempts to be the biggest womanizer he possibly can, they still manage to squeeze in Tom Hardy being a complete bad ass. The paintball scene is one of the highlights, but the most original aspect of the movie comes in one of the first (of many) dates Tuck has with Lauren. He takes her to a carnival and at the end of it takes her on the trapeze. It's actually really cool and would be a really fun first date for anyone.

This Means War is a frustrating and awful excuse for entertainment. Its humor is lame and offensive in the way that it insults all of mankind by how stupid and immature it is, its plot is horrible and insulting, and Reese Witherspoon will test every last ounce of patience you possibly have. This Means War gives you the impression that women are easy and that if you've got enough game then everything works out for the best. While it does have a few moments that try to make up for how terrible it really is, This Means War still can't shake the fact that its spewed excrement into your face for over an hour and a half.",1329436800,15,4551,4.584766584766585
4729089,4,B005LAIGY6,"Overall this movie is enjoyable if you go in with the proper expectations. It's pretty obvious from the previews that this is a concept film. They have a fun concept with potential and make most of the movie about that. It isn't about well developed characters, it isn't about a meticulously crafted story, it's about the concept and making it entertaining. If you go in expecting some entertainment, and some laughs, I say this film delivers. It was actually much better than I personally had expected.

The first thing I attribute to raising this film going experience above my expectations was the casting. I knew Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy and Chris Pine were leads cast to bring some (varying levels) of star power. I didn't expect them to put as much effort into their characters as they did. Hardy has been a breakout star lately and he plays the heart of the film in many ways. It is his character that starts the events of the film when he desires a real relationship that might lead to a wife. He plays that classic kind of hopeless romantic character but in a way that feels real and makes it fun to root for him as the apparent underdog. Pine is also a recently rising name, he is perfect at playing an unattached male who suddenly feels as if he has found something new, if only by accident. He is so confident and amazingly able to do so without being a jerk, it becomes just as easy to root for him. On top of that Pine and Hardy have a great chemistry that I wasn't expecting. A real advantage of the film was that they didn't just say these guys were supposed to be buddies, they showed it. Hardy and Pine really play off of one another as buddies up front (something not seen in the previews) which makes their increasing rivalry much more compelling. It also turns some jokes that might otherwise only merit chuckles into full out laughs. This film took some time to set up the friendship but also the respective meetings of both guys with the girl, I at first thought it was a fairly pointless exercise, why not just get to the point as advertised, but I realized later that taking that time made the rest of the film more engaging.

Witherspoon may be the most guilty of having an underdeveloped character, a fault of the script more than her own, but she does an excellent job at playing a woman who is very torn between these two men. This familiar situation works well here because she sees both men as being so different. Then there is Chelsea Handler who plays herself more or less, if you like her shtick you'll enjoy her here, if you don't she isn't a major role and plays more of a sounding board for Witherspoon.

The action is the kind made on a B-movie budget aspiring to emulate an A-movie. That said, I was pleased with the action overall. There was some bad CGI but things moved at a good pace (a positive trait of the entire film), action came along at all the right times to break up the comedic sequences. Nothing new or revolutionary but some solid scenes that are fun and easy to follow. It's fun watching SPY VS. SPY when they actually attempt to give these guys all the abilities and resources a spy would have at their disposal. My favorite scene, I feel it to be a standout in regards to blending action/comedy, was a paintball sequence where Hardy tries to impress Witherspoon by taking down the whole battlefield single handed. Not only did the scene strike a good comedic balance it was fun to watch and well choreographed. There is a standard b story where a major league criminal of some kind wants revenge on the guys but it is only really there to give the film a fun preliminary action scene and an ending with some explosions and higher stakes.

In the end it's not hard to figure out who she ends up with based on some early set up in the film but it's not about that. This movie is about getting out and having some laughs and fun without feeling like you're being ripped off or cheated, perhaps going on cheap night helped me in that regard, but I feel I'd still be content if I'd paid full price. They avoided the danger of under delivering and actually over deliver in some respects that raise this film to a solid 4 stars for me. I don't personally feel compelled to buy it but I'd watch it again on movie channel or even rent it under the right circumstances. Worth it for a night out, especially if you're a couple and the vow happens to be sold out.",1329177600,4,4413,4.411042944785276

Second, the CIA agents are using government resources and spending US tax dollars to stalk a woman and also causing major havoc all over Los Angeles. When they shoot Chelsea Handler's tires out on her car, she could have easily been murdered. That was just reckless. They are not very good at their jobs. Speaking of Chelsea Handler, we all agree that it should have been played by Leslie Mann, right? And finally, where did Angela Basset go?",1506124800,,533,4.804347826086956

It's not an awful movie and can be funny at times, as long as you don't overthink it.  If you DO overthink it, you will realize that these three individuals are deplorable and bring out the absolute worst in each other.  The leads are all very charismatic actors, but their characters are loaded down with over the top flaws that the screen writer clearly thought was funny.  but seriously, if I could date any of these characters, I would choose to be single.  Tim Hardy is apparently a gun toting murderer and Chris Pine is a serial liar and lotharo, and both abuse their power and position to stalk Reese Witherspoon.  Reese Witherspoon sleeps with both guys at the same time and doesn't tell them about each other.  Wow.",1500076800,3,823,4.63448275862069

I got it super cheap, so I gave it a go despite some of the poor reviews  and...it's cute, funny, and yes predictable, but I was entertained. After watching so many serious, psychotic, or heavily action-based performances by Hardy, this was a huge departure but he can do humor quite well and is a strong romantic lead. It was a nice change of pace.

Reese looks great, she and Chelsea Handler are funny together, there are two gorgeous men, some sweet dates, some sexy dates, great bromance banter between the guys, and plenty of action so there's something for everyone. I would definitely watch again!",1486684800,3,707,4.8347107438016526

I might be old school but I am only 32 and I miss the old days of true romance. Man the world is so screwed up when we think it is OK to due this for a man or woman.

I could do without Reese Witherspoon but hey, someone has to play the female, right?

4731389,3,B005LAIGY6,"Girl follows her Mr Right to LA only to find out he is Mr Wrong. She winds up with a pretty good life nonetheless only she is lonely. A friend encourages her to sign up for online dating. Friend posts her profile for her as she refuses. She meets one guy from her profile. They have a good time. She meets his friend on the way home and gets almost blackmailed into dating him. They eventually warm to each other. Both guys are in the CIA and do recon on her and each other when they are on their respective dates with her. It becomes a competition.

This was supposed to be a funny guys-fight-over-girl scenario. However, it really isn't. I cannot stand Chelsea Handler. I have no idea what kind of person finds her foul mouth funny but I do not. I actually think she is misery and miserable. She looks sad. Anyway the sleaze factor was raised high with her presence in this movie. So either she had a negative influence on what was supposed to be called humor in this movie or the pervs making it were just drawn to her to act in it. Either way it was doomed with the decision to have her associated with it. On the same note I have no idea if Chris Pine is a good guy or a sleazy semi-off guy. I don't know if they cast him because he is a good actor and comes across this way. Or if he is just that way and he transforms his roles into this sleazy guy motif. Either way he up's the sleaze factor of this movie substantially. Then you have a supposedly sweet girl who just works hard, goes home and eats popcorn while watching Mr Rogers in her sweats as she was cheated on by her ex one minute. Then this girl who is not only dating two men at once but decides to sleep with them to decide who she wants to be with another minute when she is not playfully dancing in her condo to some crude rape song. So again the sleaze factor appears. She isn't someone you side with. She isn't someone you identify with. She pals around with the Chelsea Handler character for a reason. Anyway the point is this isn't a cute boy girl movie. It is gross.

Also who knew Thomas Hardy was such a beautiful little man? First movie I've seen where he doesn't have some mask on. I say this even though he does have a eerie resemblance to Jude Law when he talks and uses the word ""lovely"" a lot.

Another unbelievable part to this movie is that I thought the CIA was not allowed to operate in the US. But then again who knows what the gov is doing after the Patriot Act turned everything upside down.",1440115200,3,2482,4.166666666666667

4731540,2,B005LAIGY6,"Ok, I'm probably not the person to ask because I hate romantic comedies in general, but I adore Tom Hardy and this fell into my project of watching Every Tom Hardy Movie I Can Possibly Get My Hands On. (Don't judge me. I'm working out of the country and I'm bored, OK?)

Look, I'll ignore that you've apparently got a British guy working as a CIA agent, which is pretty much impossible, and that they go around breaking international law with very little subtlety and somehow fail to start a war with China. I'll ignore that Tom Hardy is terrible at pretending he knows how to speak Russian, and the guy who is not Tom Hardy is terrible at pretending he knows how to fight. I'll also ignore that the whole spy revenge plot that crops up in like the last five minutes of the film to give our protagonists the chance for a revealing heart-to-heart during a car chase is tacked on like part of a second-grader's art project. In short, I am willing to suspend almost all disbelief.

Almost.

The one thing that irritates the living hell out of me about this movie, and about many romantic comedies, is how completely mediocre the female protagonist is. She works in a consumer research company. She collects Gustav Klimt posters. She brags about having done gymnastics in high school or university or secretarial college or something. She has apparently never played paintball. The only things she has going for her are that she's upper-middle-class and like 100 pounds. And based on that alone, we are supposed to believe that two crazy-hot adventurous talented sculpted polyglot guys who spend half their time gallivanting around the world and taking out criminals are head over heels in love with her. I simply could not get past this fact.

That said, Tom Hardy is as always a gorgeous and magnetic presence onscreen. If you're looking for a movie that allows you to stare at Tom Hardy's luscious lips and beautiful blue eyes while he flirts shamelessly with the camera, enjoy. Just know that you are probably a lot cooler and more interesting than his love interest in this movie, and yet neither you nor I will ever get to date Tom Hardy.

I know. Reality is terrible.",1437696000,26,2170,4.655352480417754

But if you love Chris Pine or Tom Hardy they make a very funny duo. Oddly enough the men have all the best lines. The rest of the script seems like its trying too hard to be funny or cute and therefore sounds awkward and not believable as it leaves the actor's mouths. Reese Witherspoon's character is even less developed. Not any of the three actor's best performances BUT very entertaining if you want a light movie.,1436486400,,535,4.469387755102041

4731729,2,B005LAIGY6,"Im a big fan of Reese Witherspoon, Chris Kline, Tom Hardy, and director McG, but here they all fell short of their normally awesome ability to shine on film. Yes the script was predictable but the same could be said about Legally Blond, but the comedic pase of that movie far surpassed this one, and it left Reese looking like a ditzy blonde. The chance for the guys to get in some great James Bond moments was totally over looked and is down right inexcusable. And McG's chance to work his visual magic with the car chase was just ok. Alot of balls were dropped for this to go so bad. Tom's hotness, Reese's sweetness and Chris' amazing blue eyes couldn't keep me from calling this movie out for its underwhelming delivery.  Two stars for effort, but I'm still VERY DISAPPOINTED.",1434153600,,780,4.531914893617022

I wish they would make an action spy thriller together as two best friend spies on a case to save the country. They have a believable  brother's chemistry.  Reese Witherspoon is great in whatever she is in...comedies, dramas, thrillers, music bios etc.. The surprise was Chelsea Handler. She was an excellent comic relief, she hit her marks with perfection.  The ending left me wondering about their brotherly relationship however.. I wanted a more happier end without a possible breakup or breakups when the Reese character hears the news too from the Tom character. As a viewer, I wanted everyone to ride off into the sunset with smiles. No internal conflicts. : )",1428883200,,801,4.9185185185185185

4731968,4,B005LAIGY6,"I actually really liked this movie. It's not really a romantic comedy, even though there's a bit of a love triangle going on here. It's not a true love triangle, but the two men are best friends who happen to fall for the same woman. Oh and they're spies/government agents. And they're both super sexy men played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. The woman who's dating both guys, but doesn't know that those two guys, know that she's dating them both, or that they even know each other. That sentence was a bit confusing but it's kind of like that in the movie. Anyway, the woman is played by Reese Witherspoon, and she is probably the perfect actress for this role. She had to be sexy and unsexy at the same time for various times in the film. This movie felt more like a buddy-cop kind of movie with some romance thrown in. To me, Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are great together. A bit of Capt. Kirk comes out since Chris Pine played that character in the new Star Trek, his Capt. Kirk comes peeking out every now and then, but it works for this film. Tom Hardy is more on the sweet side since the last film I saw him in was Bane from Batman, so those two characters are completely different. Tom Hardy has a lot of range in his acting abilities. This is a good movie for action, romance, comedy, drama and it's a buddy-cop kinda film.",1428278400,,1329,4.277777777777778

4732045,2,B005LAIGY6,"This film was a terrible vehicle for both Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon. Little character portrayal, so thinly realized that truly, it is a waste of time.  Both of these stars deserve much better scripts and characters to portray.

The premise of two CIA operatives who are best friends, accidentally dating the same woman within 24 hours of each other, seems like an ok basis for a fun film.  But it became merely a set of scenes, not very convincing, strung together to get to the ending.  The only satisfying moment of the film in any way was seeing Hardy's character finally released in the end to become real to his family.  Even then, the script was so bad that only through Hardy's vulnerable streak could one feel that a cartoonish character became flesh and blood for a moment.  Witherspoon is beautiful but also has the same problem of a terrible script and very thin character.

About 10 seconds of action adventure that was sorta fun.  But waiting all that time for a tidbit of interest, twice?  Bleah.

I thought it a waste of time.  Don't bother, and certainly don't buy it.",1426636800,,1090,4.625

And Tom Hardy was a pleasent surprise, I had watched The Drop a few weeks earlier and thought he was excellent in that movie. And was surpried to hear his accent. Plus i love the fact that they didn't make this another movie about twenty yearolds. The fact that these were 3 adults was great. Plus Chalsie Handler cracks me up. The only thing I wished they had done differently was make Reese end up with the Tom Hardy charecter instead or Chris Pine once again he just seems like a jerk. The guy he played I think seem's pretty spot on. Maybe it would help if he was EVER  cast as a sweet loveable nice guy just once it might change my opinion of him.

Even the editing was perfect.

One thing I thought was really stupid was when she weighs the pros and cons of both men, the con the British Spy had was  the fact that he was British. Are you kidding me!

When I saw that she had this movie coming out, I was like...hmmmmm....I'll watch it for Tom Hardy and Chris Pine because...I mean....DUH. They are hot and are eye candy. I hate watching movies because of ""eye candy"", but that was the deal here.

I watched it and about halfway through the movie, I wanted to pull my eyes out of their sockets. No joke. The bad part was, I was on a plane and couldn't get away from it, other than pulling my headphones out of my ears.

The script was terrible, though it had two funny parts I guess. And I'm not saying Reese is an ugly woman. I just don't see Tom Hardy and Chris Pine fighting over her. Then again...she did date Mark Wahlberg and she was married to Ryan Phillippe. Go figure. The bottom line is, NO ONE had chemistry in this film, except for Hardy and Pine and they weren't trying to get with each other. By the end of the film, I was hoping THEY would get together and leave Reese alone. And I'm still waiting for someone to tell me why in the heck Chelsea Handler was in this film (or why she's even ""famous""). Jennifer Aniston would have been better as the lead. I do not enjoy Jennifer Aniston, but at least she's tolerable to look at and a decent actress.

My advice? If you want to see this film....wait for it to come on TV. It's been out for a while so, it should be coming on FX or TNT or something. Save your 4 or 7 dollars and just watch it on tv.",1399248000,,1591,4.19281045751634

4733904,4,B005LAIGY6,"I stayed away from this movie when it first came out for a couple of reasons. I thought that the language would be a problem and i was right about that and I wasn't attracted to the love triangle.  You just never know what Hollywood is going to do in the name of comedy.
But, I was working my way through Tom Hardy's work history via IMDB and saw that this could be rented for a reasonable rate, so one windy day I rented it.
Now, I agree with everything everyone writes about Chelsea Handler if they wrote that she was awful.  Her character was obnoxious and crude and filthy.  I'm willing to bet I just talked 80% of you into renting and/or buying the movie with that one sentence!  Anyway, I didn't appreciate her character AT ALL.  But, I filter out the stuff I don't like and move on to what I do like.

I liked Tom Hardy's character in this.  It was a different than some of his other stuff.  The guy's got ""swagger"", what can I say? I was routing for him.  Chris Pine's character, I'm sorry to say, is like all of Chris Pine's characters.  He was handsome, slick, charming and sexy.  I'd like to see him do something else, but this was a good vehicle for him.  Reese Witherspoon was also ""typical"", so that made the movie very cute and funny. A typical Rom/Com and what's wrong with that?  I liked it so much that I bought the movie after renting it, which is rare for me.  Now, I can fast forward past Chelsea Handler and I don't have to deal with her vulgarities.  Win/Win in my book.",1395100800,,1493,4.226148409893993

Bad guy comes along and captures her to use against the two of them. Bang Bang, she chooses one guy over the other and the other guy goes back to his ex-wife.

All three main actors manage to sell the concept, though, and Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are a lot of fun to watch as they woo Reese and try to outdo each other.  And the scene where Reese uses Chris to make her ex jealous, well . . . we should all be so lucky! ;-)  If you want a light romance with a little spy action thrown in for good measure, you can't beat This Means War.",1374796800,,550,3.9279279279279278

I didn't really like the commentary, however. The director repeatedly panned the decisions he made and apologizes profusely for making a good movie instead of over-sexing it to make it filthy, although as much as he comments on the actors bodies and looks its obvious he has the sexual maturity of a teenage boy. It's great to see a movie with good acting that allows you to imagine what is happening off the screen instead of a brain dead spoon fed story and single dimension characters that perform on screen the most obvious and gratuitous version of what is possible.",1374019200,,739,4.736434108527132

After watching ""Lawless"", I HAD to watch ""This Means War"" again, and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor at the end...his performance is amazing.  ""This Means War"" is a FUN comedy/romance movie with two friends who work for the CIA and accidentally begin dating the same woman (Reese Witherspoon).  Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are the two secret agents who begin an all-out war to win her affections.  There is lots of good action, especially the scene in which Tom Hardy takes Reese Witherspoon to play paintball!  OH MY GOSH, that is HILARIOUS!  This movie is well worth the 1 1/2 hours of pure fun and entertainment.  Don't expect Academy Award writing, but I'm almost positive you will be pleasantly entertained.

4734754,5,B005LAIGY6,"Tom Hardy, Chris Pine, and Reese Whitherspoon, make a perfect comedic, romantic, love triangle, as two best friends who are CIA agents use their resources, techniques, agents, and skills, to vie for the affection of a woman they've only seen on a dating website,(her best friend set her up a page-making her very exciting) without her knowledge.  She likes them both, not knowing they are agents and that they know each other.  It's a cheesy love story with a rather cheesy ""mob"" story line provided by a foreign criminal.  I personally am curious to know how many foreign agents we have in the CIA since Tom Hardy has a beautiful British accent.  I also wonder how much trouble the agents are in once the supervisor finds out they both investigated the girl and used other agents to do so using time and resources-aka...""money"".....in reality-this would happen or should happen, also, when watched on an HDTV, the set looks very cheap.

It's one of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen!  And I am a sucker for a romantic comedy and have a rather high threshold of tolerance of plot holes for the sake of a cute love story or likable characters.
But there is nothing really cute in this story, it's barely a love story, for that matter: the chemistry between characters is non-existent, so you really don't care who she ends up with.
Like someone else said, to call it ""clichd"" would be to pay this movie a compliment.
The premise is fun, and it could be a fun little movie, but the execution of the premise is so weak that it is painful to watch.  Dialogue is something I could have written (and that is NOT saying much), characters are two-dimensional, their inner life non-existent, the girl's final decision can be guessed before she even enters the movie.
Really, about 30 seconds worth of fun that you see in a trailer are about the only redeeming things about this movie.  So, watch a trailer, and get a different movie.",1370044800,3,1197,4.358744394618834

Something beyond..is there anything better than that after we have this or that whats next something new innovative surprising like an apothecary from ancient times, a metallurgist transmuting base materials into gold..from the opening scene in the shopping store, and is there anything bette than Tide, and the young women walk right by Tide don't even look for what..I always check the price of Tide it cleans inside out. The lead after having gone through a bad relationship..wants something beyond the generic..willing to pay for it..yet at the end all we have are romps and sex and somethings gone wrong..the men try to capture the girl like putting something in your pocket..that goes wrong..there's some sex..and even at the film's finale the two boys, men..wonder about who slept with whom..and the female may sleep here and there...these two CIA spies at the start of the film from Hong KOng to a sushi bar..and there's much action and violence..and is a fun film and you should leave it there thats all it's meant to be..it in no way tries to be that type of film serious reviewers want..viewers found it enjoyable..a young girl choosing among suitors..equally covetous..and perhaps the sex..thats all you can expect from these two..there are some fun lines on role playing..and Reese witherspoon the actress seems to play this hip chick al too well much as she was good in Vanity Fair and classic type roles..and in very short time taking on roles very swift and mastering them..like the apartment scene with the music on the large TV..roles..alter egos..thats why a writer having her in a film..knows the scenes can move swiftly and the audience will pick her up quick..but the characters never get much beyond beyond beyond..generics..these type of stories work best when a background is well written up and firmly implanted in us..but all we ever get is the surface trinity of romance..the spy from Hong KOng fizzles and seems just violence and car chase scenes and we don't know why or what is goin gon there and it seems like a chop suey movie..inundating our chracters lives..it tries to be  aglobal tale with people from different places..and scenes..and that too doesnt succeed that well..I like a movie where the heroine from Atlanta does not feel at the end she has to choose from two..but there's only one choice..she loves and is capable of loving..but we know when she passed up on the Tide..a long scene what we were in for..I think its fun watching an actress who can tap into alter egos and then return to a normal state..some are very good..they are great actresses..even when its a different person..but tap into it like from the beyond..",1367193600,,3146,4.730418943533698

4734891,5,B005LAIGY6,"This movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't.  I don't think anyone involved expected a dozen Oscar nominations, the actors never expected their photo's on the cover of Time.  This is a silly, sweet, fun movie.  A madcap romp that harkens back to romantic comedies of the past.  The entire cast makes you fully aware that they are not to be taken seriously. Tongue, firmly in cheek, they are having as much fun on the screen as you should watching it.  This is pretty much the only kind of movie Reese Witherspoon should ever do.  Whoever she is in real life notwithstanding, this on screen persona is what she does best.  As her best friend, Chelsea Handler is an unexpected surprise.  Her best moment is when she puts away the biting sarcasm and self deprecating humour and tells us why she loves her husband.  All really good comedies need those moments of utter clarity and seriousness and this movie is no different.  Chris Pine plays an excellent smart ass, so his amiable, slightly smarmy demeanour comes as no surprise, but it is perfect for this vehicle.  It would certainly limit his career if he spent it's entirety in this sort of movie, but if he did he would leave a catalogue of fun movies as his legacy.  Tom Hardy has proven himself in some really dark films.  His characters in the Batman franchise, Lawless, Warrior and Wuthering Heights expose the menace just below the surface, the melancholy that informs his vulnerability.  One is always certain that Tom Hardy, the man, is probably not someone to trifle with -not if you are fond of your front teeth or the shape of your nose. It is his ability to convey it all without saying a word that makes him such a phenomenal artist.  He still brings great presence and gravitas to this film, but here the vulnerability is sweet and hopeful.  This is the sort of honourable, kind man who is willing to show his feelings, longs for true love but who can still beat the crap out of anyone who threatens his loved ones and/or an international terrorist.  Whichever happens to be the problem.  This character is so great that were he real American women would overlook the fact that he's ""British"".  If you enjoy the camaraderie of buddy movies and bromances and you love it when true love conquers all then this movie is for you.  If however, you are a miserable old git, go look for something else.  This movie will do it's damndest to make you smile.",1365724800,5,2421,4.583720930232558

From the competative comaraderie that exists between heroes FDR and his longtime friend and partner Tuck when they both meet and fall for the same girl, to the avidly incorrect advice given to Lauren by her best friend as she tries to navigate the turbulent emotions that arise from falling for two men,  to the very real threat to them all when the guy's latest assignment hits home.  There is no downtime in this movie.

4735159,2,B005LAIGY6,"Overall, this was an okay idea, that lacked a really good story to support it.  Movies I can't finish, get a two star from me.
The story follows two best friends, who work as ""secret agents"", make a bet on whose going to get ""the girl"", or who she'll pick.  The girl, of course, has no idea there is a bet, nor does she know these two guys are best friends, AND secret agents.
The cast they hired, is obviously very good actors.  It was the story that was lacking for me.
I'm all for ""fun movies"", even romantic comedies, but there has to be some point to the story, a foundation to the characters, and comedy is really hard to write.  Okay, two guys going after the same girl, is a story that's been done.  Now, show me how you can make it a really interesting story, that keeps me glued to my chair, because I can't wait to know what happens with the characters.  The story just came across, very shallow, and so did the characters.
I recommend ""Crazy Stupid Love"" instead of this movie because it had a much better story, with plenty of twists, characters I believed in and liked, and I found it very funny.",1361836800,,1110,4.261904761904762

One of the best lines in recent movie history delivered with perfect comedic timing.

Even though Reese Witherspoon is the headliner the buddy story is well played by Tom Hardy and Chris Pine. Oscar worthy? No. Entertaining. Yep. Not all movies have to have deep life changing meaning. Some are meant to be silly. This is one!",1360972800,26,421,4.675675675675675

Hardy and Pine fighting over Reese Witherspoon is probably appealing to a lot of ladies so I'm sure boyfriends and husbands everywhere will be sitting through this lack luster attempt at film making.

If you really want to have fun though, drink every time there's a continuity error, a poorly used green screen shot, a scene where the actors weren't in the room together or just cheap hurry up film making, oh, the sun is pure white light, at dusk?  Okay then...

This Means War insults the audience by thinking we will never pick up on how the whole thing is held together with a lick and dream, I'm sure everyone was happy to get their paychecks and leave this piece of junk behind on their IMDB.

Reese never looked hotter then in this Movie and her Timing and Grace like always was here. Another great Role by Reese. Then you add the Spies in Pine and Hardy who are so fun together and they again show there range. I can't wait to see Chris in the upcoming Jack Ryan movie as the New Jack Ryan he will be great. This Means War is just a fun movie. Won't win any awards but it's not made to do that.

4735576,3,B005LAIGY6,"This is a very stupid movie. It's really unbelievable, poorly thought out and edited, and has some really badly directed scenes. Plus, I mean - well, you'll just have to watch it to understand. It tries so hard to be cool that its like watching your wannabe player friend hit on a hot girl at the bar while he's drunk. Super painful .

However, Chelsea Handler has a few really funny scenes, and REsse Witherspoon is...well, the way she usally is. The good part of this movie, and the reason I didn't hate it is because of the two leading men. Tom Hardy and Chris Pine look like they had a blast filming this movie, and watching them be badasses and compete with each other in increasingly crazy ways is pretty damn fun. There are some great lines, some funny scenes, and on the dvd there are deleted scenes, a gag reel and alternate endings that add interest.

So, its a good background noise/popcorn sort of movie if you want to see attractive guys do attractive things and Chelsea Handler be crudely funny.",1357948800,,1009,4.508196721311475

The question came up as to how we can make a date flick that has guy appeal, say, Nicholas Sparks with some firepower.  I was a little dubious about this movie because it was directed by McG, the man who helmed the abysmal ""Charlie's Angels"" flicks.  Never fear because McG has learned his lessons and toned down the quick cuts and pyrotechnics to deliver a servicable romance-comedy-action extravaganza.  Matters are helped because the leads (Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Tom Hardy) are appealing prescences and make the film's more predictable elements tolerable.

4735749,1,B005LAIGY6,"Poor Reese Witherspoon.  It seems like her career has taken a serious nosedive since she won the Oscar back in 2005.  Before that Oscar win she was America's Sweetheart, had a lucrative career, was a memorable comedic actress who commanded with dramatic temperament and who had already secured a place in everyone's heart with her rich performances in `Election', `Legally Blond' and `Walk the Line'.  Since her win she's gotten horribly rusty and can't seem to make a decent movie, let alone put in a decent performance.

She makes me uncomfortable.

I'm not one who likes to pick apart an actress based on petty things, but Reese isn't aging well (she's gotten so hard looking) and so she really needs to pick roles that don't make her the center point of male attraction.  It just isn't working out for her.

But, `This Means War' is far from Reese's failure alone.  No, this film doesn't work for many, many reasons.  Most of all, it's just plain stupid.  Sure, we have to expect that to a certain degree because of the trailer itself.  I don't think anyone would watch the trailer, note the target audience and assume this were a masterpiece of cinema, but one should expect a little brains with the bravado.  Sadly, this film fails to bring either.  The love triangle between Foster, Tuck and Lauren is uninteresting and the way they go about their petty competition for her heart is insufferably unintelligent.  I mean, they obviously think the audience is stupid, and so they continually insult us with ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario.  Chris Pine hasn't interested me since `Star Trek' and here he lacks nearly all charm he needs to carry his character.  Tom Hardy is the only thing that works about this film (he's sensitive, childishly charming and actually funny) but he can't make the premise, which is just so forced, work.

The action scenes are slicked up and feel like a rip on something by Michael Bay, but they are laced with so much preposterousness (the final chase scene is strangely anti-climactic and the inclusion of Lauren's input makes this just silly) that they fail to make any real impact.  But this film fails mostly because of the core love story, which makes little sense, especially Lauren's final decision (even though it was expected when you consider where it leads).

All in all, a dumb film can be fun if the dumb isn't so dumb it makes you feel dumb for watching it.",1355961600,3,2420,4.7601918465227815

Bottom line:
For guys - It's okay to screw over a friend and waste your co-workers time and resources to stalk a woman.
For girls - It's okay to be a slut and date multiple guys and when pressed to make a choice settle on the sleeziest candidate possible.

Ick!

I so wish Hollyweird would stop flushing thousands and millions of dollars down the stool to crank this junk out.
There is no merit to this and you will really be ticked off by the end. When you find yourself cheering on the bad-guy and then being disappointed that he doesn't kill the three leads then you know you have sat through a serious loser.

The serious confession is how much I love, (LOVE!!) Tom Hardy. I love a man with full lips so I loved him since I laid eyes on him in RocknRolla. Gerard Butler and Idris Elba were in RocknRolla and I was waiting for Tom to show back up on screen. **

There are situations in the film that could have been dealt with in a less elaborate way and I noticed those moments right away but I decided to ignore them and just follow the story line. It was  fun, it was cute and I enjoyed it enough to re-watch the film. It is a Rom-Com with Action, not an Action film with Rom-Com, that distinction makes me allow for the flaws in the plot when dealing with part of the spy storyline.

Your modern date night movie feels a bit contrived and stuffy for me - an avid comic book & horror fan. But when Kirk and Bane (natch) went head to head for the charming Witherspoon and the whole effort was brought to us by one of the men responsible for my favourite show Supernatural (McG), there simply was no way for me to avoid this flick.

The premise is simple - two top secret agents botch a covert mission and they get on the radar of the film's antagonist. Then the two agents, best mates, start dating the same girl. Hilarity ensues, along side some mighty fun action and some great film gags. Everyone on screen is, simply put, perfect in creating an absurdly and hardly plausible plot... and it's great!

The special features are fun: a great uncensored gag reel, some opening previs work, commentary (which is quite fun, too), and for the main course - the Alternate Endings. I'll simply say the final Alternate Ending is VERY predictable and quite likely the hardest I've laughed in nearly ten years.

4736489,4,B005LAIGY6,"I won't go to much into the plot, because I don't want to spoil anything for you.  The basic plot is that two spies who are friends have fallen for the same girl, and they both compete for her attention. That's all I really want to say about the plot.

Yes, this is a predictable movie, and you will know what happens before it does, but that's okay. Usually movies like that kind of annoy me, but for some reason this works.  This movie has it all, action, comedy, and a bit of romance. It works on all levels.

There are several laugh out loud funny scenes in it. The three main actors do a nice job on their comedic timing, and deliver their lines and make it seem natural. They did a fantastic job.

For me, there was one drawback, and that's Chelsea Handler. God, she's horrible. All of her scenes were annoying and hard to watch.
If you're looking for a perfect date movie, this is it.

Overall, I really liked it and will probably  pick it up, or put it on my wish list.",1347667200,,977,4.192513368983957
4736490,2,B005LAIGY6,"Remember that ""Charlie's Angels"" movie from a few years back that was directed by McG?  Well, based on this clunker that was his masterpiece.  With 3 fine actors and one great comedienne in the cast what could go wrong?  Well, a script to begin with.  A comparatively thin and smallish looking Tom Hardy (""Lawless"") and Chris Pine (""Unstoppable"") are 2 CIA agents who are temporarily put on desk assignment due to their perceived missteps on their last assignment.

In addition to being partners they are also best friends.  FDR (Pine) is the ladies man whose cover is a cruise ship captain.  Tuck (Hardy) is a divorcee with a 7 year old son, looking for a relationship.  Through a series of unlikely circumstances they both zero in on Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) who tests products on a local TV show.  She evidently is having a hard time getting back in circulation after a breakup.  Her best friend (and the best thing in the movie) is played with relish by Chelsea Handler.

In addition to a ridiculous script where each guy has a team of coworkers inside the agency that break all kinds of rules, regulations and laws, the movie is subject to poor editing.  The sets look pretty cool.  In fact, too cool.  I noticed some snazzy blue lights showing up in places where they shouldn't, like toasters and other appliances.  In the opening sequence the evidence of a green screen is so evident it could be used for how not to use a green screen in film class.

Poor Angela Bassett is along for the ride as the guys' boss.  She doesn't do much other than bark at them once in a while.  There's a secondary plot about some nefarious type who's out for revenge because Tuck and FDR killed his brother.  This allows for the traditional car chase in the last act.  Most film watchers should be able to predict what's going to happen after the first 5-10 minutes of this movie.

The Blu ray disc gives an excellent transfer.  The usual 1080p format shows a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The colors seem unusually vibrant so if you like blue and chrome you'll like the picture.  The audio is also very good with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track picking up every nuance as well as some thunderous gunplay.",1347408000,3,2187,4.577319587628866
4736491,2,B005LAIGY6,"Found this movie painfully predictable and slow.  It was a cute idea and I looked forward to a light, yet entertaining romantic comedy.  But, it lacked the spark that is so likeable in most of Reese Witherspoon's movies. There was no depth to the ""bad guy"" scenario, so that part seemed pointless.  I disliked the FDR character and he never grew on me even though it was obvious how his character would play out.  Tuck was more interesting, but even his character became boring. Katie's character was basically non-existent and her role in the movie seemed carelessly thrown in for a poor wrap up.  I also hated  the way both guys acted and really didn't want Lauren to choose either one, but of course she did.  Ugh.  I would have given it 1 star, but I laughed at a few scenes and that's what made it bearable.",1347235200,,812,4.476190476190476

He had high praise for this show.  The plot was good, the acting was great, and friend was sure my sister would love it.  This was the basis for ordering it.

Hardy is a very physical actor, Pine relaxed, and Witherspoon is sassy and take no prisoners. The performances weren't bad but, for me, the movie did not work.  It might be that the script wants to be a romantic comedy, buddy movie (gal/guy pairs), and an action/spy flick.  It adds nothing new to any of these genres. It is predictable and prosaic.  Too many coinkydinks and too much boom boon took away from the plot line.  I think we saw this same film in a better form a few years ago in when Edward Norton was contesting for a girl with his friend the priest.  I have not seen a really good romantic comedy coming out of Hollywood in a long time.  The best romance was in a film called ""Goon""...yep the knock your teeth out hockey movie.

4736894,2,B005LAIGY6,"I had really anticipated this movie and, boy, what a let down! First of all, Tom Hardy's character FDR is a complete weirdo. He practically begs his best friend, Tuck, to let him shadow his first date with Lauren (Reese)- I kept thinking, ""Dude, get a life!"" - and then he behaves like an arrogant a** when he, by chance, meets Lauren at a video store. Lauren shuts him down, which I applauded but he keeps coming back. He gets even more stalkerish by bugging her home and following her on her dates with Tuck. The biggest thing was that he completely lies to her and says he is in to her favorite artist while getting lines fed to him through an earpiece; he lies about volunteering at an animal shelter and loving kids etc. So, basically, he makes up a person that he thinks she would like and, guess what, she falls for it!

Now, Tuck is pretty stalkerish too, but at least he makes a real attempt to be genuine when around her. He takes her on fun, interesting dates, introduces her to his son, and just seems a lot more honest compared to FDR. But Lauren thinks he's boring.

Guess who gets the girl in the end...

The only reason I gave this 2 stars was for the scenes with Lauren and her best friend, which were pretty funny and the scenes of Tuck and Lauren's dates. I thought those were kind of sweet.

Here is the movie, Witherspoons characters friend talks her into joining one of those dating sites.  She wants to get off the site but sees a guy on there that she thinks is good looking.  The guy works for the government.  Him and his friend go around taking out bad guys and saving the world.  So, the guy tells his friend he joined the site and is going on a date.  His friend and him decide that they will both go so the other can be his wing man.  But, his friend starts liking the girl as well.  Which one will be able to get the girl in the end?

That's it, the entire store.  Now I know that most stories sound simple but have things from A - B that make you interested.  This is not one of those movies.  These guys have very important jobs in the government, yet they act like two children when it comes to this girl.  The one does not date much, but the other says he always has dates.  So why then is he so dispirit?  They decide they will both date her and let her choose.  They set ground rules.  The use government equipment and men to help spy.  One scene has one of the guys following the other with one of those drone things that fly's in the air.  The other guy (while in the passenger seat of a moving car) pulls out his gun and shoots down the drone.  Ok, how much do those things cost?  Are you telling me the guy can just shoot one down and get in no trouble?  In another scene the guy throws a knife directly at his friends head.  Nothing seemed real during this movie.  These guys would have gotten in so much trouble for doing any of the number of things they did.  Another thing that bothered me and my mom as well, there were never any other people in the office with the two guys.  There were desks, but not one other soul.

It was such a dumb movie.  It cost $5.99 to rent of FIOS, I think it was a waste of money.  We laughed at parts, but the entire time I was thinking to myself about how bad it was.  If you want to buy this movie, rent it.  You will thank me later.",1343001600,5,2034,4.01

This movie has a 7-layer dip identity crisis (romantic comedy, buddy flick, chick flick, spy vs. spy action thing) with no single element really delivering the goods. No surprises; no plausible spark between any of the characters. We can tell the guys were aiming for the quippy Clooney/Pitt screen sizzle, or at least some of the old Martin/Sinatra sass. No luck. In fact, FDR's shallow, not-quite-reformed playboy thing got old very fast. I kept waiting for Witherspoon's character to turn out to be a double-agent hired by the base-jumping German guy to get the boys to kill each other.

This is the first time I've seen Tom Hardy anywhere.  Chris Pine was already known to me through Star Trek (big original series fan but really like Pine as young Kirk).  Now I own copies of Warrior, Rocknrolla, This Means War, and loved Mr. Hardy in Incepetion.  Am awaiting The Take as well  Hardy and Pine are adorable and believable as best friends who would take a bullet for one another.  McG's commentary includes praise for all three leads, and he is clearly a Tom Hardy fan.  That is something that was missing in Warrior's commentary where Tom Hardy was easily Oscar worthy.

Again, do not bother wasting your time watching this movie!!",1342310400,,432,5.042253521126761
4737001,4,B005LAIGY6,"Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) is in a funk about not obtaining a particular man for her own. So her friend in passion Trish (Chelsea Handler) puts Lauren's profile on a dating site. Soon Lauren meets two different men. Turns out they are both looking for love or at least a challenge. The two men are CIA agents, FDR Foster (Chris Pine), Tuck (Tom Hardy), and now unknown n to Lauren are vying for her affection. Toss in some besmirched bad guys and you get the idea.

I won't go into any more detail as it is the unfolding of the story and the interaction of the characters that you will want to obtain a copy of this presentation and watch. I will say the film was well executed and has a slick seamless presentation that is not found in low-budget films.

Aside from all the laughs this movie deals with love, lust, friendships, trust, and other weighty emotions. However if you're looking for some sort of new insight or exclusive story twists you can just forget it.",1342310400,,968,4.494318181818182

4737042,4,B005LAIGY6,"Lets say, up front, I was not excited to watch this.  What kept me from leaving the living room and doing something else to avoid what the trailers portrayed as a Rom-Com with a actioney-aftertaste was A) Captain Kirk Pine, and B) Tom I-Can-Do-Anything Hardy, two actors who, at least before the movie, clearly should have known better than to star in a Reese Witherspoon movie.

I didn't know McG directed this, but it became obvious at the opening action sequence - I won't spoil it for anyone, but it was quintessential McG, over the top, fun, jaw dropping, and frankly hooked me in to the rest of the picture with the allure of at least SOME action to go with cheesy, cliche rom-com storyline.

And believe me, you won't escape that part - this doesnt break new ground in that sense, and if there is a massive weakness to the movie, its that they tried so hard to deviate from the romantic comedy formula, only to revert to the same old tired plot of most movies before it.

WITH the exception of the action...its done well throughout, and it turns what couldve been a less-than-memorable flim into one that I'd watch again, and as rom-coms go, that is a short, short list.",1341878400,,1177,4.511737089201878
4737043,4,B005LAIGY6,"I wanted to see This Means War as soon as I saw the trailer.  I think Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy, and Chris Pine are all terrific actors.  I like spies and things blowing up, so those seemed liked great elements to liven up a romantic comedy.  The critics hated it, but I can't think of a single critic partial to rom coms.  Thus, I checked This Means War out once my local Redbox had a copy.

Witherspoon is terrific as Lauren, a successful products tester (think Consumer Reports), who gets signed up for a dating website by her married friend.  Her first date is with Tuck (Hardy), a good-looking, charming Englishman.  After her date, she runs into FDR (Pine), and is unimpressed by his womanizing ways, but he wheedles a date out of her anyway.  Of course, the two men aren't a travel agent and boat captain like they claim - they're longtime partners in the CIA and willing to spy on each other and Lauren in order to get the girl.

I thought This Means War was pretty funny, although I wasn't entirely on board with the ending.  It was pretty obvious which guy Lauren would pick, although I thought the other guy was a better choice for her.  (It's obvious because Hollywood has this thing about reuniting divorced couples.  In real life, most divorced people I know prefer to spend as little time as possible with their former partner.)

Genre-wise, those hoping for a true melding of action movie and rom com will probably be disappointed.  The action is limited to the cold open and the climax.  Unless you count goofy spy antics as action.  I put those under the comedy half of the rom com label.  The couple of action scenes are pretty cool and I liked that Lauren's knowledge from her job was key to saving the day.  (If the men spying on the woman is a little uncomfortable, at least Lauren is never expected to give up her career, friends, or other interests for a relationship.)

This Means War is a perfectly serviceable rom com, though it's no classic of the genre like Witherspoon's career-making Legally Blonde.  The material might be thin but the charismatic and attractive cast is more than game.  While rated PG-13, This Means War falls on the raunchy side.  Mostly verbal jokes, but there are definitely some references parents probably don't want to explain to younger teens.",1341792000,,2302,4.6182266009852215

4737461,5,B005LAIGY6,"This is a romantic comedy combined with a spy thriller that continues to entertain with never a dull moment. The appeal of the story structure is part of the success since a beautiful woman in love with two men, trying to choose between them, is a never fail plot strategy. Having the two guys appeal to the audience as much as they appeal to the character played by Reese Witherspoon kept up the suspense. Male competition is also a great plot element and this film has the two fellows in competition while at the same time dependent on each other while serving as CIA agents.

Reese Witherspoon is excellent, as always, but during the film I realized how often she tilts her head when talking to a man, conveying almost constant seduction.  One of the agents, played by Chris Pine is the playboy type and thus the viewer wonders whether Reese is the woman that can make this playboy settle down. He is contrasted with another CIA agent, played by Tom Hardy, a man with family instincts. Chelsea Handler plays Reese Witherspoon's best friend who offers terrible advice.

This is a good romantic comedy with Reese Witherspoon in rare form. She is complimented by two male actors who are perfectly cast. The script is funny and action packed. It is good entertainment.",1340150400,,1267,4.698198198198198

4737464,4,B005LAIGY6,"A romantic comedy with an action-backdrop.  It's been done before, but in the past and limited by smaller budgets and less easily achievable CGI technology.  This little date night charmer comes complete with serviceable (but admittedly, and hopefully intentionally, stupid) action--great, in fact, for a RomCom--and a good buddy dynamic between our two best friend spy-by-trade male leads:  The ever-shallow ladies' man, FDR (Chris Pine; Bottle Shock, Star Trek, Unstoppable), and the more soulful and soul-mate-y, Tuck (Tom Hardy; Inception, Warrior, Dark Knight Rises).  Both actors have proven their worth with a recent flurry of genre admixture.  Then, of course there's Lauren (Reese Witherspoon;  Water for Elephants, How Do You Know), an overly sharp, generally adorable, successful Consumer Report analyst who can't seem to find a date even though she has a great attitude and takes care of herself--oh, and she's as cute as Reese Witherspoon.  Don't find it plausible?  Don't care?  The flick simply works in its own silly way and Chelsea Handler is fantastically funny as Witherspoon's sister.

The flick kicks off when Tuck and Lauren meet via ItsFate.com for their first date.  It's rather abbreviated, but quite sweet.  Shortly after, FDR bumps into Lauren, fancies her and has a womanizer meets girl-power innuendo battle which culminates in an invasion of her workplace until she agrees to a date.  Tuck and FDR find out the very next day that they like the same girl.  Neither is willing to back down so it is suggested they compete to win her affection.  And, with two newly adversely-faced best friends vying for the same woman, we found the title of this movie: This Means War!

Tuck and FDR's friend dynamic is great.  It starts with the nave gentleman's agreement that if their competition over Laura affects their friendship then they both would stop pursuing her--as if!  They get together for Chips marathons and work together and really know little more than the other has to teach.  During their bro-romantic feud they both abuse their surveillance and super-spy gadgetry privileges at work.  This likely cost a lot of tax-payer dollars.

Their recon leads them to all of her childhood fantasies and...some unreasonable adult fantasies as well.  Of course, being overpaid fantasy-movie spies, they make them happen with no problem while competing for her affection.  When it comes to using CIA ear-pieces (inciting the Patriot Act, for God's sake) to have their subordinates aid them, and the sabotage thereof, it got truly wonderful.  Seeing FDR try to narrate art history while Tuck listened and chimed in to distract him...simply priceless.  Overhearing their own flaws and watching themselves overcompensate on surveillance footage is nothing if not enjoyable.  To win her over they adopt milky-eyed, venerable dogs and paintball preteens into post-traumatic-stress-disorder to make up for their perceived flaws.  Thank you, Chelsea Handler, for helping to make that happen.  Handler brings up sex at the most inappropriate times and I dare not ruin how.

No matter what the conflict, these brothers in arms returned to each other as besties.  The happy endings number more than one and will leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy in the standardly lame ways.  FYI, the ending is glorious!

Favorite Quotes, all from Chelsea Handler except one:
""Stop referring to Boggle like it's a man.  You sound like a woman who has nine cats and knits her ass off.""
""You know when you know you're going to have dirty sex and it's gonna' stink?  Not like sex.  I mean like man stink, the good stuff.""
""Do you think Gloria Steinham got arrested and sat in a jail cell so you could act like a little bitch?  I don't think so!""
""You're not going to Hell.  And if you go there, I'll be there to pick you up.""

4737465,4,B005LAIGY6,"There are tons of movies released every year and the fact is all of them can't be the most stupendous movie ever made. But there are many that fall into the category of fun movies that offer no redeeming value whatsoever and yet are filled with fun and energy. THIS IS WAR is one of those movies, a film that's fun to watch and may be worth watching again and yet it offers no social redeeming value. So what? It's a movie kids!

FDR Foster (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are two CIA agents for whom action comes easily. Both are experts in their field and the best agents around. They're also best friends. When an operation goes from covert to public awareness, the duo finds themselves behind desks at the home office in LA.

FDR is a ladies man, always on the prowl. Tuck is more subtle with a failed marriage and young son he adores. When they find themselves stuck at home, Tuck decides its time to find someone special and pops his info, or the info he creates, on to a dating web site. There he meets Lauren (Reese Witherspoon).

Lauren is an up and coming single in LA as well. Her job has her testing products for a consumer group. Her long time girlfriend Trish (Chelsea Handler) feels that she needs to get out. To give her a nudge, she posts her name and info on the same couple's web site Tuck visits but with info that Lauren isn't quite happy with.

Lauren and Tuck set up a meet but Tuck has FDR as back up, hanging out in a nearby video store. The meeting goes well and ends soon after they meet with the promise of a full fledged date to follow. On the way home, Lauren stops to rent a video at the same store FDR is at. With no clue who she is, he hits on her and through a series of circumstances gets her to go out with him. The result is two best friends dating the same girl with no clue until each shows the other of their latest love interest. What follows is a game of trying to one up each other to see who gets the girl.

Using the resources of the CIA the duo spy on each other's dates as well as gain information on Lauren. Using that information they both treat her to some stupendous dates doing the things she likes. Things go so well that she has a hard time deciding just who she wants to be with.

While all of this unsanctioned surveillance is going on, bad guy Heinrich (Til Schweiger) is trying to find Tuck and FDR. When that opening sequence to the film went bad, the pair had killed Heinrich's brother and he's now set on revenge. Tracking down the pair to LA you know it's just a matter of time before a face off results and the chances of Lauren being in the middle of things is pretty good.

The movie follows the usual Hollywood pattern of mixing comedy and action with comedy being the main focus. The situations that the heroes put themselves in trying to impress this new woman in their lives make for some funny scenes. Each time she mentions something she likes or dislikes about them, they attempt to prove her wrong by either doing what she wants to overcoming the things she might dislike about them. All in all it makes for some funny moments.

Best of all with this film is the ease that the characters and actors bring to the story. It never feels forced of fake even though being fake is what most of their actions involved. I've said before the proof of a good actor is to not feel like they're acting and all three here display that in spades.

More than anything the movie is fun. It delivers the right combination of action, comedy and romance that create an enjoyable watching experience. I wasn't sure what to expect from the trailer for this film and actually thought it would be something light but more mediocre than it was. When I was finished I knew that this was a movie I could watch and enjoy just as much a second or third time around.

  What is wrong with this movie? Lots. First, when the two guys decide to fight over Reese Witherspoon, they have both just met her, and had zero invested into the relationship. These guys are supposed to be best friends. So why would they go to War over someone they just met. It is all about ego. Second, Reese doesn't look right. I think she must have had Botox for the movie. Her face isn't the cute face we loved in Alabama, and Legally Blonde. Third, she ends up with the guy that lies about everything. Neither of the guys are real in any way. They both are putting on an act to win her, but the fact that she ends up with the one that lied and cheated the most, is really disgusting. Lastly, one of the guys is divorced with a kid. Neither the kid nor the ex-wife wants anything to do with him, until they find out he is a spy. Then he is mister wonderful.
  None of these characters have any depth. I didn't hate the movie, but at the end, I felt like they certainly deserved each other.",1339804800,,1154,4.255707762557078

Both men are totally lying and faking to win her over and after she finds out, she is only mad for a moment and then picks one! There are a few laughs, one when Chelsea's car lands in a lake (where were the airbags?), and one when Bad Boy appears to have fallen asleep. Of course this sleeping scene has him asleep at one angle with his head back, and then with his head flat in the next angle, and then back to flat again.

4737776,1,B005LAIGY6,"How do we spell studio formula script writing for dummies (aka ""Cheap Ways to Make Money"")?
(1.) CIA agents against German bad guys (later associated with Serb bad guy). Germans as bad guys? Where have the writers been these past decades?
(2.) CIA agents have their usual gruff, antagonistic boss; get in shoot out (massive bullets flying everywhere) with the usual, soon to be dead, half dozen bad guys at a big party (without bystanders getting hit); usual slide and shoot or roll and shoot, etc. scenes; usual helicopter on roof top (to save filming costs it just sits there); usual one bad guy escapes with usual paragliding chute; usual someone falls off of roof edge only to last second grab the edge by fingertips (not as good as Cruz in Mission ...) which incidentally is impossible - try it, but close to the ground; usual divorced dad with non-connecting son and ex-wife.
(3.) The main hook is that the two CIA guys are on the look-out for females and happen to connect with the same one thus the comedic part except that the script and dialogue were so juvenile Hollywood dumb speak that I was asking myself ""Who in the world is the target audience?"" Was it the rom-com females or the action males? Could it be both?  We all know what happens to a meal recipe that is cooked to please everyone. It turns out to be mush for everyone.
(4.) Usual satellite with HUD identifier info overlay on important locations e.g. CIA headquarters. Thank you Google Earth! Overdone and cheap looking.
(5.) Online dating was added to contemporize the movie for whatever age group that is still enamored by the idea. Largely a LA/NY writer's thing.
(6.) Poor acting, filming and directing resulting in Pine, Hardy, Handler and especially Witherspoon stuck in predictable acting role ruts. Can they do anything else? Camera angles made car chase scenes look more like what was being done in the '70s and fight scenes that were obviously fakey with punches not even close to their target.
(7.) Good movies attend to detail yet, just one example, look at the final scene of the SUV rolling on the overpass then check out the shadows of the SUV, the people and the other vehicle. All the shadows are in different/wrong locations relative to the Sun (or we have a very tricky Sun).",1338508800,14,2269,4.68671679197995

Maybe if they had made it more campy, like a Men in Black type thing, it would have worked. But it never seems to settle into one genre or tone - in some places it seem to be going for heartfelt romantic comedy, in other places it is slapstick, and then in still other sections it is full on action movie. Most of the time it is just BAD.

Reese is charming enough, but there's not a lot of chemistry between her and either of the two male leads, so I wasn't really rooting for her to end up with either of them. I'm not sure how this ever looked good to her on paper, but maybe the original script worked better than what ended up here. Chelsea Handler has some funny moments, but adds to the oddness in tone.

4737863,2,B005LAIGY6,"The director that brought us Terminator Salvation has decided to find material more in line with his skill level and gives us the ultimate forgettable date film.

Two CIA agents in a full-on bromance fall for the same girl. There's some B plot about a terrorist-slash-bad guy after them that wouldn't even pass for a filler episode of CSI. The script borrows heavily from True Lies but fails to copy the good parts that make it work, leaving us with a film that lurches violently from shooting five guys at point blank range to soppy scenes with The Witherspoon. In the midst of this, her character spends the entire film pondering the dilemma of dating two guys while her exposition sidekick Chelsea Handler gives her someone to talk to.

Anyone who really works for the CIA must roll their eyes when they see poorly researched and frankly unbelievable nonsense like this. If you think the Secret Service's call girl incident in Colombia was bad, a single day in McG's intelligence agency involves wiretapping people you date, starting shootouts in Hong Kong and basically doing anything but your job (all Angela Bassett's watch, too). It makes John McClane look like a real-life cop.

None of this would really matter if the characters were engaging and it was fun - but given the quality of actors here, they all phone it in and the level of chemistry is pretty low.

The main characters are good actors and do pretty well within limits of the story.  Too cheesy, a bit contrived, but not bad for light mindless entertainment.  Almost should give it a two, actors are worth a 4 so I give it a 3 star revue.

Not bad, not good.  Much less action than promised, less sex too.  Mostly teases with both and provides very little.  What it provides is pretty good, but it is only a miniscule part of the movie.

Based on a story by Timothy Dowling who with Simon Kinberg and Marcus Gautesen adapted it for the screen, the film in many ways seems like a parody of several film types - chick flick, espionage capers, buddy movies, and relationship studies.  The fact that it throws these ideas all into one mixing bowl and comes out not only making sense but having fun doing so makes it well worth watching,

Two best friend CIA agents - FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) - find themselves in competition for the affections of the same beautiful woman, Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), an attractive but chronically unattached product testor and facilitator for focus groups whose best friend Trish (the brilliantly funny Chelsea Handler) constantly urges Lauren to date - even if on the internet. FDR and Tuck are accustomed to using whatever means necessary to complete a mission, a trait that mentality has a tendency to enter into their personal lives and when they discover Lauren's dating blog (create by Trish), they're both on it. They enter into a gentleman's agreement that stipulates they not interfere with one other, allow Lauren to choose the best man for her, and walk away from Lauren if seeing her begins to affect the men's friendship. The agreement quickly degenerates into a one-ups-man-ship contest of epic proportions thanks to the men's competitive natures and the arsenal of government resources at their disposal. Oblivious to the rivalry and the high-tech circus going on around her, Lauren desperately tries to figure out which of the two men is right for her. The behavior patterns of FDR and Tuck help make the decision - that, and the fact that Tuck has a son by a girl he cannot forget, Katie (Abigail Spencer).

This is a non-stop action film filled with moments of tenderness and hilarity and espionage tactics gone awry. The superb trio of actors is supported by Angela Bassett (don't blink or you'll miss her), Til Schweiger as the bad guy on a mission against CIA, and Rosemary Harris. In the end it is all fun and laughs and solid movie making.  Grady Harp, May 12",1338163200,2,2180,4.852150537634409

The biggest fault is that I didn't care about the characters, or which guy won the girl.  That's a death knell in a rom com.  The action was ok, but not enough to save the movie. And the best friend?

The story is beyond predictable, but that doesn't mean it's not worth ""date night"".

The movie is about two close friends. They are CIA partners, you know that there is a brotherhood that only forms when you put your life in someone else hands. That relationship is put to the test when they both fall for the same woman ... in walks femme fatal, Reese Witherspoon whose character contains that charm which has made Reese a mainstay in cinema.

The plot is a road-map that lists all the main attractions along the way. You know where it's going, everyone's been there before, yet you still have fun. This movie is above all else a romantic comedy. It has just enough action to help guys enjoy the movie with their girls. It throws in a bit of situation and physical comedy to keep it from being sticky sweet.

You'll probably know what's going to happen before it does. That's ok; and it's ok to laugh out-loud even when the jokes are completely obvious. Allow yourself to enjoy this no brainer comedy and you might even find yourself rooting for the inevitable evolution each character has.

Still not sure? Rent before you buy and decide for yourself, after all, no two people are alike.

Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine) are Secret CIA Agents. Tuck, a single dad is interested in falling in love again.  Lauren (Reese) is funny as a consumer product evaluator.  Her friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) makes her a dating profile on an online service to help her get back into the dating pool.  When Lauren and Tuck go on a date, on the same day, she runs into FDR who not only manages to piss her off but talks her into going on a date.  Both men are dynamic and interesting and both are go out of their way to find out what Lauren likes to one up the other by using all their resources at the agency including being able to track each other as they are on a date with her.

I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and here's why:

1) Great movie for couples because it is nicely balanced with action and romance in a way that really works.

2) Chelsea Handler is too funny. Wish she was in it more. It is the perfect role for her as Lauren (Reese's best friend). She is witty and deadpan. ""Oh no! I'm Yoko!"" and ""Do it for all the woman who have to have sex with the same guy every Wednesday night at 9:00 PM while eating Cheetos."" Bwahahah hysterical.

4) Tons of action, explosions, gun fights, fist fights, jumping off buildings, car crashes and more. Tuck and FDR are secret CIA Agents.

5) Loads of sexy scenes of Reese trying to decide which guy she loves. Poor Reese she always has such a hard job.

The storyline was not original and some of it just didn't feel realistic to me but the characters, mainly the two girls were fun to watch. I loved the unique things she did on her dates. On one of the outings she went to a darkly dim lit private room with a trapeze. They played together for hours, swinging back and forth, falling laughing to the twined ropes below. On another date, she is a child with her date and his little boy at her job where She reviews products. She got out the toys, a popcorn maker where the corn just blew all over the room, squirt guns with water, spraying each other and having laughing good times. On another date she did a paintball adventure, they set it up like it was a real combat and they had to take the other side over. She had fun with her friend who didn't hide anything, she was very honest, yet that loving nurturing was not present in this film. So it was cool real, if that makes sense. I liked when Resse and her friend sat on the floor at this restaurant and the cushions were all over, they just talked and talked. I liked when she raced the classic car around the countryside. I liked when she was in a house with music that was loud and sexy, she made her popcorn and relaxed. I think that Reese's character seemed free, she sang in the city with all the people, headphones on, she didn't care about being herself. I love Gustav Klint paintings as well, so it was fun to watch such an original date. It is another neat excursion when you go to stay the weekend at an alpaca farm drinking the fresh milk eating cheese and watching the clouds scud in the sky, where birds and larks sing.

4738252,2,B005LAIGY6,"Two CIA agents FDR Foster and Tuck compete for the love of the same woman Lauren, using their espionage skills and the organization's high-tech weapons. And in their spare time the young agents (who are also best friends) save the world from terrorists. The agents are played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. Their love interest is played by Reese Witherspoon. This is buddy film meets romantic comedy meets spy action. The idea seems fine enough, at least on paper.

However, ""This Means War"" is a disappointment. You don't have any real action scenes. All you get is one generic shoot-out, so-so car chase and Til Schweiger as a villain who looks bored. As for the romantic aspect of the film, Reese Witherspoon is miscast. I like her, but though she does her best to infuse charm into the underwritten character, Witherspoon, known for playing brainy women, is not convincing as a woman who cannot make up her mind to choose. The same goes for the characters played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy, both talented actors. Unfortunately, they are given no chance to show their skills, comedic or otherwise.

The film's supports include two Oscar nominees Angela Bassett and Rosemary Harris. Their roles are small and forgettable. Instead, the film spends pretty much time on very annoying Chelsea Handler playing Witherspoon's best friend.

""This Means War"" is directed by McG. I liked his ""Charlie's Angels"" for its utter silliness which was fun. Everything about ""This Means War"" is also silly, but not much fun because everything is done in an unenthusiastic and lukewarm manner.",1336089600,10,1575,4.935849056603773
4738253,5,B005LAIGY6,"When this film came out, the critics seemed almost hostile to the idea that audiences might want to watch a movie just to have a good time.

Another objection was that the premise was unrealistic. Well, it IS a comedy, and the story seems at least as believable as 3 guys going to Vegas and waking up with a tiger owned by Mike Tyson in their hotel room.

Reese Witherspoon has been making audiences laugh for a long time, and we love her for it. Tom Hardy is well known for his ability to inhabit villians and sociopaths, but anyone who has seen ""Scenes of a Sexual Nature"" knows he can be very funny indeed. I didn't know much about Chris Pine, but I was not disappointed. The timing and chemistry among the three principals was right on target, in my opinion.

4738254,2,B005LAIGY6,"I don't know why, but I am surprised by how sitcomy and amateurish ""This Means War"" is.

Director McG is not known for particularly well-made or subtle films (""Charlie's Angels"", the sequel,  ""Terminator: Salvation""). But his films make a lot of money. And his name is on a number of fairly successful television shows. So he continues to work.

FDR (Chris Pine, ""Star Trek"", ""Bottle Shock"") and Tuck (Tom Hardy, ""Inception"", ""Warrior"") are CIA Agents and best friends. Returning home to Los Angeles, Puck decides it is time to start testing the dating waters again because it is time to find someone and settle down; everytime he sees his ex-wife and son, loneliness hits him like a ton of bricks. He posts a profile on a dating website. Lauren (Reese Witherspoon), the head of a ""Consumer Reports""-like service also recognizes it is time to do something other than work. Her pushy, salacious sister Trish (Chelsea Handler) puts her profile online, against her knowledge. When Lauren finds out, anger gives way to curiosity when she spots Tuck's profile. Tuck gets nervous and asks FDR to tag along. He agrees to wait at a nearby video store, to provide an out if necessary. Lauren and Tuck meet at a nearby caf&eacute; and get along great before they decide to go on a second date. Lauren leaves, to find a video and spend the night alone. At the video store, FDR starts hitting on her, unaware she was Tuck's date. Before you can say ""meet-cute"", both friends realize they are dating the same woman and turn it into a competition, using their CIA resources to try to one-up the other. And a terrorist (Till Schweiger) also wants to extract his revenge.

Written by a slew of people and directed by McG, ""This Means War"" is a silly, completely unbelievable and unromantic ""romantic comedy"".

Nothing about ""War"" works like it is supposed to. The initial date between Puck and Lauren is sweet and seems like it could lead to something. But she ends the date, so she can rent a video and spend the evening alone. Huh? If I were on a first date that was going as well as this one seems to be going, the last thing I would do would be end the date so I can spend the evening alone.

But this is, of course, a necessary plot contrivance designed to get her near FDR so he can spot her and they can begin flirting. They don't really seem to have any chemistry at first, but oddly, they agree to go on a date.

There never really seem to be any moments of actual romance in ""War"". Both men begin eavesdropping on Lauren's life, with the aid of CIA resources and electronics, and begin using the information they gather to make them seem sweet and thoughtful and to make their buddy seem like a cad. FDR takes her to a warehouse to view original Gustav Klimt paintings. A nice, sweet idea, but he learned of her love for the artist by eavesdropping on her. This robs the gesture of any goodwill and only makes their relationship seem creepy. Also, why a warehouse? It would be far more romantic to view these in a dramatic museum or art gallery. The warehouse does nothing but raise a series of odd questions. Rather than build any romance, these gestures only serve to establish a rhythm of FDR and Tuck trying to one up another. Maybe they should just get a room and end the misery for the rest of us.

Pine and Hardy don't really act in ""War"". They are more similar to guys who are watching a football game, rooting for their team and throwing barbs at the people who root for the opposing team. I guess it is supposed to be funny.

Reese Witherspoon has more to deal with... err, work with. She feels some mild (very mild) trepidation about dating two guys at once. This 'conundrum' gives her character two-dimensionality. But that really isn't enough.

This is also a major stumbling block for the film. After she has what seems to be a pretty terrific first date with Tuck, she leaves the date so she can go to the video store and find something to watch that evening. Alone. Wa - haaaa? I know I have already mentioned this, but it is just a ludicrous plot point. If you are on such a great date, why wouldn't you stick around for a while and get to know each other better? But she must meet FDR, and soon, so she doesn't have time to build any overly romantic notions about Tuck.

Worse, since her date with Tuck was so memorable and they seem such a good match, her initial meeting with FDR is completely the opposite. He comes on very strong and she decides to spar with him. The filmmakers are trying for a Cary Grant - Rosalind Russell type of thing. Actually, that's probably too advanced for the filmmakers. Maybe Goldie Hawn - Kurt Russell? Nope. Julia Roberts - Richard Gere? Closer. But there is simply no connection between them and it is all but impossible to understand why she would agree to go on a date with this guy. Mila Kunis - Justin Timberlake? Bingo.

Even worse, because FDR and Tuck are CIA agents, the filmmakers have cobbled together meaningless business involving a terrorist (Schweiger) who comes to LA to extract revenge for the death of his brother at the hands of the two CIA agents. Throughout ""War"", there are moments tracking the man's movements, to remind us of his existence, so when he pops up in the big finale, we will remember who he is and accept him. But all of this is handled so poorly, these moments only serve to stand out like a sore thumb. Most episodes of ""Chuck"" balance the romantic subplot and the spy business much better. McG was also one of the producers of the television series, so it seems a little shocking to watch these moments which are handled so poorly. Was he trying to use material he had leftover from the TV show?

Worst of all, Angela Bassett plays FDR and Tuck's boss, entitling her to pop up a few times, always cross and glowering at her two subordinates. Is this really the best work Bassett can get? If so, that is an extremely sad indictment of Hollywood.

I don't get Chelsea Handler. I've never watched her show and have seen her twice-in two different things; I watched the first episode of ""Chelsea, are you there?"" the same one everyone else watched before tuning out. And now this film. In both, she seems to be around simply to nag people. Not very interesting or pleasant.

""This Means War"" is a confused mess. It wants to be a romance. It wants to be a spy caper. It wants to be an action film. But it doesn't do any of these things well enough to compensate for the shortcomings of any of the other elements. In the end, it just ends up resembling a big screen version of a bad episode of ""Chuck"".

4738255,2,B005LAIGY6,"Perhaps the best part about following movies from birth to completion is that you get to see every single step along the way, both for good and ill.  For instance, This Means War, which had a script that had been floating around Hollywood for years, along the way going through so many changes that it no longer resembled the original concept. Initially titled Spy vs. Spy like the eternally bickering agents from Mad Magazine, Sam Worthington, Seth Rogen, and even Bradley Cooper saw the writing on the wall and hightailed it away from a potential disaster. McG, who remains popular because his name sounds like it should be on a fast food menu and because he made a lot of money with two flicks of hot chicks doing crazy stunts(how'd he make that work!!?), has been in love with the film since the beginning even while nobody else has.

Now after what seemed like an eternity of trying to find a release date weak enough for the film to quietly settle in, we get This Means War, featuring the promising trio of Captain Kirk(Chris Pine), Bane(Tom Hardy), and Tracy Flick(Reese Witherspoon) and the results are decidedly unpromising. Hardy and Pine play Tuck and FDR Foster(seriously that's his name), two best friends and CIA agents who are like a less interesting, somewhat homoerotic version of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence in Bad Boys. When we meet them they're undercover investigating a case that involve a global terrorist(Til Schweiger), but don't get too invested in it, because the rest of the film sure as heck doesn't.

What matters is that Tuck and FDR are buds, joined at the hip. They're like The Beatles of the black ops set, until a Yoko Ono by the name of Lauren(Witherspoon) jams a monkey wrench into the spokes.  Lauren is the stereotypical rom-com hot chick who can't find a date, but for once it's pretty clear why: she's got all the personality of a sack of hammers. Her married and bored best friend, Trish(Chelsea Handler), puts her on a dating website, where she instantly meets Tuck, who as a single father can't make heads or tails of the singles scene. After the success of their first date, she hooks up with the smooth, charming FDR in a video store(they still make those!!?), and soon she's stringing both guys along like puppets.

It isn't long before the two old friends discover they're dating the same girl, coming to a gentleman's agreement to see who can  win her heart. Of course it goes disastrously wrong, with both abusing the government's surveillance assets, wasting our taxpayer money, and shredding the Constitution at every turn to make sure the other doesn't ever round third base with Lauren. There's actually some good mileage that can be had from that idea, but the script is genuinely awful, and feels like it's been re-written by a bunch of folks over a number of years. Oh wait, it was. Almost from the beginning the film feels dated, with ancient jokes about the dangers of online dating, and a soundtrack that sounds like it was ripped right out of someone's Walkman(tm).

It's a shame to watch two such talented stars wasting away in such throwaway material. Two, because Chris Pine is about as bland of an actor as one can be, with his helmet hair and John Doe face. He's like leading man clip art, and his character's swagger is never believable for a moment. Without the benefit of J.J. Abrams' writing, Pine disappears from view. Hardy shows some of the same ferocity he showed in Inception, but mixed with at ouch of playful goofiness that occasional works. He actually has the film's one big laugh, during a paintball game in which his CIA skills are put to lethal good use against a bunch of weekend warriors. Then, in what is basically a microcosm of the film's mediocrity, that scene is ruined by some lame genital humor that goes nowhere.

The one to feel sorry for is Witherspoon, who just can't seem to find her niche anymore. Romantic comedies are usually where she butters her bread, but she's struck out wildly with the last few, only finding mild success in the period romance, Water for Elephants. McG knows how to emphasize her greater attributes, she remains beautiful and perky, but her personality makes her the equivalent of a MacGuffin. What are these two guys fighting over exactly? She's not that much of a catch. Surprisingly, it's the usually irritating Chelsea Handler who comes out unscathed, because basically she's just doing a watered down version of the routine she's been doing for years, that of the drunken skank. It's easy to knock McG for his two Charlie's Angels movies, but they were intentionally frivolous and tongue in cheek. Terminator Salvation was a disaster that killed an entire franchise. He showed some skill with his decent but forgettable football drama, We Are Marshall, but whatever he had then appears to have been flushed down the toilet.

Then again, every one is pretty horrible in this movie. Tuck and FDR lie. Lauren lies. Nobody really pays for it because...well, everybody is so darn good looking. Unfortunately, This Means War isn't, so it might be a good idea to raise the white flag of surrender a little early.",1332288000,8,5135,4.7671541057367826
4738256,5,B005LAIGY6,"MOVIE REVIEW #24: "" This Means War""

Here is a fun and funny movie that not only had humor and action adventure but a true thread of realism between the characters. Chris Pine (Star Trek 2009, Unstoppable) and Tom Hardy (Star Trek: Nemesis, Inception) are a pair of FBI agents who accidentally start dating the same girl. Reese Witherspoon (Legally Blonde, Walk The Line) has the awkward position of dating two men who she has no idea that they know each other.

What's the foil? Since both Chris and Tom work for the FBI so they have all kinds of electronic surveillance equipment at their access and quite by accident they realize they are dating the same girls. Now they make a gentlman's agreement to let the best man win - but it becomes far more competitive and actually very funny. No to mention the added intrigue of an international killer trying to kill them both.

Reese has a best friend played by Chelsea Handler (Chelsea Latley, Reno 911) why hysterically guides her on her various dates with each men. The two of them discuss each date and plot the next one with hysterical commentary of each man.

The movie was directed by McG (Charlie's Angels, Terminator Salvation) and it contains tight action scenes, funny dialogue and a great three-way between all of them. The bad-guy is just a small motivator to the story, but the heart is in the characters,

The movie has a lot of action, fast cars, gadgets and a real heart! You understand what each character is doing, thinking and feeling and in the end - a very believable and perfect resolution is made. All within the context of being targeted by an international killer played by Til Schwieger (New Year's Eve).

This was an extremely entertaining film for its genre and Reese, Chris and Tom are great on sreen together. The script has a lot of twists and surprises and the direction is sharp and tight. Fresh entertainment . (3-2012)",1331510400,4,1902,4.6626865671641795
4738257,5,B005LAIGY6,"Most hilarious movie I've seen in years.  Everyone in the theatre was laughing so hard that thought we'd all bust a gut.  Couldn't stop laughing.  Recommend it.  There were a few words that were a little offensive, but other than that.  But not for children.",1331078400,3,258,4.644444444444445
4738258,5,B005LAIGY6,"This was a cute love story, peppered with laughter and a little CIA adventure.  A pretty girl (Reese Witherspoon) is in between romances when she meets 2 awesome guys.  One is an airline pilot; the other is a travel agent.  What she doesn't know is that both guys are best friends and both are CIA agents.  When the guys find out they are both dating the same girl, the plot gets competative and funny.

I was between a 4 and 5 star review with this one, but I enjoyed it so much I rounded to 5.",1330819200,2,495,4.114583333333333
4738259,2,B005LAIGY6,"Chris Pine (Star Trek) and Tom Hardy (Inception) usually have good taste in movies but not with This Means War. If C.I.A agents are this self-centered and immature in real life, I'm scared. Their characters use everything the C.I.A has to offer to woo Reese Witherspoon's character and also spy on her. While her character is a two timing hussy who has no problem dating both men at once.
  The characters aren't likeable, the action is clumsy and the film is full of romantic comedy cliches. Here's a lesson for Hardy and Pine, if you can work with Nolan and J.J Abraham's, you can say no to doing a McG (Charlie's Angels) film! While someone as hot as Witherspoon is only on a dating site if it's a fake profile! Witherspoon as a woman desperate to impress her ex, Reese, desperate, really? ?
  While Hardy is a little more likable since he wants to meet someone since his divorce. Pine just doesn't deserve to win Witherspoone's heart since he has more luck with women and is a self -centered jerk. He should be a good friend and just step aside but his ego is too big.
  A action/romantic/comedy for Valentine's Day is a nice change but not when it's lazy and not much different than any other bad romantic comedy. A dog attacking one of the leads in a romantic comedy, was funny in There's Something About Mary, but now isn't very original.",1330819200,5,1345,4.51440329218107

The only thing that I did not like was Tuck's wife, who did not seem to care about him until after she found out his true profession, then she was all interested in him. That seemed excessively shallow to me, and made Tuck in the end seem like a doormat. Other than that I enjoyed it.",1527724800,,412,3.9759036144578315

8477567,3,B005LAIGY6,"This is a romantic comedy with action mixed in. However, it's not up to par as ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and Reese Witherspoon was ok but Abigail Spencer would have been better as the romantic love interest. I didn't know Tom Hardy is short, and that detracted from the movie since Chris Pine is taller (which doesn't make their battles seem fair).
