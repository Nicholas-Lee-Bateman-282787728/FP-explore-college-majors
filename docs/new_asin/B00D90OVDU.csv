8590728,4,B00D90OVDU,"A interesting collection of war films, some of which deal with the rail guns mentioned in the title. I was a little disappointed as the segments on Gustov/Dora are only five minutes of running time. The films are in German, of course, with English following the German. This dvd is both PAL/ NTSC, so it will play on HDTV just fine. It does cover a rare subject, but I have to warn you that most of the footage is of the attack on Svestapol and not rail guns, that being said, the film shows rare footage of all these guns in action.",1468454400,,533,4.235294117647059

Yes, it had some good pictures of those big artillery pieces, but it was primarily a potpourri of German military footage from the Second World War.  It was good but disappointing.  With a little extra research the producers could have made an excellent documentary.",1429920000,,305,5.06
8590731,5,B00D90OVDU,"Collection of WWII German B&W films with over-narration in English.  Seeing the railroad guns in action was very interesting for a military railroad buff like me, but some of the films also showed how the various military components (theoretically) worked together.",1425427200,2,265,5.463414634146342
8590732,3,B00D90OVDU,I would have liked more information on the railroad guns instead of just pictures. The best part is the showing of the immense size of the Gustav.,1422748800,2,146,4.444444444444445
