8159858,5,B000L2128G,Just watching cyril cusak is enough--but the dramatisation of the great lockout of 1912--the culmination of this film makes it one of the finest--I suppose-mini series I have ever seen.,1291852800,4,185,5.2
8159859,4,B000L2128G,"It is thirty years since I last saw this production and whilst there is a certain roughness in the editing (a lack of slickness) coupled with overly orchestrated background music, it is no doubt that this production remains enjoyable. Mind you, its portrayal of unspeakable poverty and the lock outs can make it feel kind of depressing but life was unbelievably hard for working class people in those days in the tenements and this comes through.

Note if you are a Peter Ustinov fan, he appears only briefly as the King and says not a word!",1271548800,2,541,4.635416666666667
8159860,5,B000L2128G,"I saw this when it was first broadcast back in 1980 by RTE. I was younger then but the show had such a profound effect on me that it stayed with me as the years passed by. A number of years ago I found a used edition of the book on Amazon and relived the memories - only more so. Strumpet City is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated of Irish books. Beautifully written with an abundance of pathos and joy amidst the misery, the book has been reprinted and is available on Amazon. You will search far to find a better read.

The television adaptation was by Hugh Leonard who maintained the integrity of Plunkett's work. The performances are collectively superb with nary a nod to ""drama"". This series was a major undertaking for RTE at the time and it is clear that the entire cast were committed to making it work. A supporting role by Peter O'Toole only adds panache to the quality but it is the ensemble that shines throughout.

This is perhaps, one of the finest examples of television adaptation to be found. Do yourself a favor and see it.",1224460800,16,1051,4.357142857142857
8159861,5,B000L2128G,"Strumpet City brings to life the conditions of early 2oth Century in what was yet British controlled Ireland.  There's no blarney to the revelations of the working-class living conditions.  This story follows the lives of a country lass, Mary (Angela Harding) and new husband, Jimmy ""Fitz"" Fitzpatrick (Bryan Murray).  Fitz joins and supports the union fully, in an attempt to improve foundry-worker site conditions.  And Jim Larkin (Peter O'Toole) arrives in Dublin to help organize strikers.

Fr. Giffley (Cyril Cusack) the aging parish head with a drinking problem, gets a new recruit in Fr. O'Connor (Frank Grimes) who feels a call to help the poor, but favors association with ""the quality.""  Fr. Giffley doubts his sincerity and treats him poorly, causing more unrest in the parish community.

In the same shoddy, crowded tenement in Chandler's Court where Mary and Fitz rents #3, abides a basement occupier named Rashers Tierney (masterfully played by David Kelly).  Rashers steals the show.  What a mangy, shabby, but loveable character.  Seven alternate episodes could be written about Rasher's life.  Rashers inadvertently gets involved in the strike rioting activity as well as the drama between the church leaders.

Peter Ustinov fans will enjoy seeing him portray King Edward VII in the first episode. View ""Edward the King"" for a delightful companion historical drama about this period of time in the UK.  It's also 5-star.

Praise times five for Strumpet City!  Kudos includes the period scenery as well as costumes, the Irish accents (begor, which could have used captioning in a couple places), quality cast, and a fantastic story taken from the novel by James Plunkett.  The picturesque film sets almost make one think that slum squalor is acceptable. The worst part of this DVD set is having to stop between the seven episodes which totals six hours (the length of 4 normal movies.) That makes the cost a value.

As Rashers would say: 'Tis the luck o' da lads and lassies t'at can view da full story in one sittin'. 'Tis like a pot o' fairy gold.  It's da gosh-truth, no blarney.",1221264000,10,2098,5.014450867052023
