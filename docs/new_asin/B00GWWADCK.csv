6120976,3,B00GWWADCK,"Mondo Media's Dick Figures movie was amazing, so why wouldn't I want to check this out? The animation and style of Aachi & Ssipak was great, but everything about the story is poop. The move is literally about feces; feces is the currency to buy blue popsicles, and everyone wants them, and by law all citizens of the city have to poop and give their excrement to the government (I don't think they ever explain why). Maybe if the story was about something different I would give it 5 stars, but I just don't have it in me to enjoy listening about butts and poops and anuses for the entire length of a movie.",1392595200,2,607,4.333333333333333

8628081,3,B00GWWADCK,"I absolutely love the animation style of this movie.

In my opinion the music in this release of the movie is better than the Korean version but the dubbing is some of the worst that I've ever witnessed. They rewrote (as opposed to translating) a lot of the script and barely even tried to synchronize the words to the mouth movements of the characters.",1422230400,,353,4.515625
8628082,2,B00GWWADCK,Animation cool. Music cool. Voice actors bad. Would of liked to have the option to watch it in Korean with subtitles.,1409270400,3,117,4.619047619047619
8628083,1,B00GWWADCK,"I'm copying over my review about the english dubbed Blu-ray as this looks to be the same version. The english dub is an abomination. It's like a bunch of idiots decided to get high and write their own script to the movie. All of the clever references from the original have been replaced with inane juvenile jokes, the voice acting is terrible, and the new music is terrible for the movie. Presumably because they couldn't clear the rights, ""misery"" turns into ""break his knees."" Instead of enjoying the True Romance standoff scene, I found myself annoyed at the techno music and idiotic dialogue. The same with the Odessa Staircase scene. And every other scene in the movie. On the positive side, if you mute it the animation is still beautiful. If you are a fan of this movie, do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY the english dub.",1394755200,,830,4.577181208053691

8628085,5,B00GWWADCK,"This is not going to be a film that going to appeal to everyone.

Originally released in 2006, and recently redubbed into English by Mondo Media, this Korean animated feature is not an inane Disney kiddie cartoon, it's not high class art, it's odd, out there, crude, violent and adult.... which is the beauty of this work!

It is a world where all other forms of energy have been depleted, the government has found a way to turn human waste into power, and were it citizens, implanted with sensors at birth, are rewarded for their valuable bowel movements with an addictive substance disarmingly called a ""juicy pop"".  This of course cause mass addiction, which is where Aachie & Ssipak come in... a couple of low level crooks/idiots, that stumble onto a plan to scam the system out millions of juicy pops by modifying the sensor of an unwitting porn star... much violence, death and deification commence.

A wonderfully unconventional animated feature, which at times spoofs films like, Akira, Pulp Fiction, and Indiana Jones, it's a fun WTF ride with some fantastic action scenes... Again, this is not for everyone, so check out Mondo Media's site, or their presence on YouTube,  if you want a better sampling of what this film is all about.",1394323200,,1243,4.816901408450704
8628086,4,B00GWWADCK,"So I watched the previews and though it looks pretty good. However when I got to Amazon I saw the other reviews weren't top of the line. I decided to take a chance and buy it anyhow. Its story line is simplistic and the humor is crude, but the fight scenes are amazing, and the art is superb. If you don't mind a hefty amount of poop jokes and violence then I'd say this is worth the ten bucks it cost.",1393027200,,402,3.9753086419753085
8628087,1,B00GWWADCK,"Its a movie about poop. I just don't think one joke can make a whole movie. Funny or not, the idea of human waste as fuel is silly.
Unless you have a really good plot to back it up.  Art style aside, the film is a waste of time.",1393027200,,228,3.6530612244897958
