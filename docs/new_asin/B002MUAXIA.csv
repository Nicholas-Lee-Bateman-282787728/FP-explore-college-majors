3952494,1,B002MUAXIA,"We own all sets before 15 & this set is NOT the quality as produced in the past. No mystery, no intrique, just a bunch of idiotic characters & no story line. To make it short, the last man in the wheel chair did it(Shot at Dawn), soooooooo obvious. I can see why John Nettles is leaving. With stories like this (very low class) & surrounded by bad writers, I would leave too. Don't waste your money on this one.",1275782400,3,411,4.15
3952495,4,B002MUAXIA,"I have all the sets but I'm disappointed that there are only 3 episodes in this set. It is padded out with a  4th disc containing a documentary about Midsomer. It's a nice little documentary, but no substitute for what should have been a 4th episode instead. All three episodes are very good, as usual. I hope set 16 will contain the usual 4 episodes though!",1275609600,,358,4.424242424242424
3952496,5,B002MUAXIA,"Let's face it: you either ""get"" Midsomer Murders or you don't. I own all of the 15 series and am eagerly awaiting 16--and, since John Nettles has aged amazingly well, hopefully 17, 18, ad infinitum. The stories, mostly, are terrific with nice twists 'n' turns--but the real point is to sit back and bathe in that terrific British character acting--you'll see many familiar faces in the cast, almost like dotty old aunts and uncles showing up for tea. Another refreshing point: the actors aren't all typical American TV silcon-enhanced bubble-heads. Golly!",1274918400,,555,5.1098901098901095
3952497,5,B002MUAXIA,"AS USUAL, THE BRITS HIT THE MARK AND BEYOND WITH THIS SERIES, I HAVE THEM ALL GREAT FUN. MURDER WITH SUBTLE HUMOR THROWN IN NOW AND THEN, GREAT ACTING BY THE WHOLE GROUP IN THIS SERIES, CONSISTENTLY. LOVE IT.",1273190400,,208,4.358974358974359
3952498,5,B002MUAXIA,"As of March 2010 the American releases of this wonderful series are running behind the UK by nine episodes. You can buy these great shows now from Amazon UK at about the same price including the shipping. Why wait over a year for the US release?

Actor Neil Dudgeon will be the new ""Inspector John Barnaby"" when John Nettles retires. Yes the character is cousin to Tom Barnaby. Maybe some of those new series will be released here by 2015.",1267401600,11,439,4.4875
3952499,5,B002MUAXIA,"I too have been frustrated that US release of many Brit series lags way behind actual production and British airing. Midsomer Murders and Inspector Lewis are what, 2 or 3 years before you can buy the dvd, though they air in many areas on PBS stations. You can get them all on disc long before general availablity  by purchasing them from amazon.co.uk. Yes they are Region 2 discs which will not work in your region 1 player,  but a Region FREE player can be bought from Amazon.com (that's right .com right here in USA) for under $50. Then at Amazon.co.uk a vast array of dvd product (Judge John Deed, Peak Practice,  to name a couple and lots more) which we anglophiles and perhaps anglos as well hunger for is available in many cases at a much better price than here and shipping just isn't that much more. I have a nice stock on hand for when we are between netflix arrivals and when the very latest Midsomer Murders or Inspector Lewis is out.

I have heard that when John Nettles retires from this series that Midsomer Murders will continue with some old cast and a new lead detective. If it can be done as classily as the producers have managed ""Lewis"" (or ""Inspector Lewis"" in the USA) as a follow on to Morse then we can have something to look forward to. But who will she be?",1263168000,41,1282,4.39662447257384
3952500,5,B002MUAXIA,"UPDATE: This DVD set not only has the 3 episode presentations, very well done, as always, but it has a bonus disc ""Super Sleuths,"" a documentary about the show's first decade which is quite interesting and welcome to even the most avid of fans. The bonus disc is a duplicate for anyone who has purchased the 17 mystery super box of ""MIDSOMER MURDERS: BARNABY'S CASEBOOK"". That set had two bonus discs and Super sleuths is one of those. For those buying this series one set at a time, the bonus disc will be a delightful added feature to your Midsomer Murders entertainment. So...Set 15 is a 4-disc pack, not 3. A value, and the episodes are suspensefully death-defying.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Midsomer Murders has a proven record and will provide any British mystery lover with appealing entertainment.  True also for British murder or British crime seekers. This series is at the top of its genre.

Rampant, unstoppable murder in one county, mystifyingly delicious making it comparable to Poirot and Foyle's War. DCI Barnaby (John Nettles) has taken on the fictional Midsomer County murder abundance, some call it massacre, since 1997 and this set offers more. Multiple killing chaos is the norm in Midsomer. But you'll be booking a flight to London (filming done in rural hamlets just outside London) to have tea with scones in the green of some village, excitedly waiting for the next bludgeoning murder (always solved).

Regulars lighten the murder storyline with homespun gentleness, some comedy through expressions, statements, and unusual additions to crime scenes.

Show guest stars make episode a fresh and dynamic. With every episode, predicting Who Dun It? is impossible. Just try!

Multiple murders in every episode are a trademark, intended from the very beginning, by the writers/producers to make Midsomer Murders unique even by British standards. No foul language issues, but plenty of good family murder mystery--the murder is almost never seen, just the moments up to the kill, and then of course the body. How many ways can a person be murdered? Midsomer keeps finding new ones. Part of the humor, actually, is the excessive number of murders in a lovely rural/village setting that could count dastardly deaths per sq. ft. But the delightful setting, sets, scenic environment is enticing, drawing you into enjoyment of yet another murder. The set is comparable to ""Foyles War: Series 1-5 Dunkirk to VE-Day"" (see my review) with comedy, scenery, and murder spoof replacing the home-front history famous in Foyle's murder mysteries.

A Midsomer Murder is like a travelogue, but better. You'll want to set yourself down in a town green, at a location like Badger's Wood, and sip tea in quality china, just waiting on a few body parts to drop from the sky. No the writers are much to cleaver for such a simple murder as that. This series was based on books by novelist Caroline Graham, but have gone beyond those book without loosing the flavor in the continuing productions of this series.  There are many yet to see the DVD light of day. How will it ever end, if it will? Barnaby discovering his own murder, killed twice?  Then who will find justice for him?",1262476800,31,3207,5.024482109227872
3952501,5,B002MUAXIA,"While I am thrilled that in 2010 Acorn is giving us an extra release of Midsomer Murders, I am disappointed that the second set of the year only includes three episodes:

Ep. 60 Shot at Dawn (or. broadcast Jan 1, 08)
Ep. 61 Blood Wedding (or. broadcast Jul 6, 08)
Ep. 62 Left For dead (or. broadcast Jul 20, 08)

Which means in the US we are still running two years behind the original broadcast. Still, the consolation is that in Blood Wedding we finally get to see Cully marry her Simon. And as a special treat, there is a guest appearance from Gavin Troy (Barnaby's original sidekick)! I think the series did loose a little heart and humour with Gavin's departure and I will be very happy to see this character return, if only for one episode.

A side note: August 19th, 2010 will be John Nettles' last day of filming on Midsomer Murders. His run as Barnaby will end with episode 82, likely not due in the US until 2013, ghhrr... Reportedly, DS Ben Jones and Dr Bullard are staying on. ITV is mum on who is replacing Nettles, though wild rumours are circulating that it could even possibly be a she, rather then a he...
UPDATE (Feb 10, 2010): Nettles' replacement has finally been revealed. I have included the details in Set 16 review.

PS: For those new to this British masterpiece, Midsomer Murders is a long running ""who done it"", based on the novels of Caroline Graham, starring John Nettles (of the Bergerac fame) as the unflappable Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby. The series is set in the fictional Misomer County, which comprises of many cosy, rural villages, where wealthy and poor alike seem to do each other in at an average rate of three to four bodies per episode. The series has a worldwide following, not in the least due to the creative and macabre ways in which the MM victims are typically dispatched.",1261872000,134,1825,4.554878048780488

We've just about finished this collection and look forward to settling into a mystery with detective Barnaby. It's nice to find a main character with a ""normal"", happy family life. The characters are a bit quirky. The plots are intricate and have a definite English twist to them, which makes it nice for something different from our American series (which we also enjoy). Very entertaining!
The only drawback is that every now and then we get a disk that sticks. I hate to miss any of the stories due to this. Still giving it 5 stars because we enjoy the series so much.",1411171200,,643,4.649122807017544

Each story is so different from each other although the murders all take place in different villages, so you get to see all the old historical houses the detectives visit.  The dialog is upbeat I hang on every word, and the way they film it, its spooky where you really feel scared at times. I appreciate the family angle they show with Tom Barnaby, chief inspector, his wife and daughter humanize him.  I could go on but I am hooked on this series in every way.

When you buy this CD be sure you view it without the kids.

You might ask how so many murders take place in one small location, but Midsommer is a county, not just a town, with many colorful locations for possible mayhem. Love the countryside shown and the local flavor. John Nettles plays Barnaby well and believably.

3952587,4,B002MUAXIA,"I love this British village murder mystery series now in its 10th year and still going strong.  By now, it seems pretty obvious to me that a majority of the population in the immediate seemingly bucolic environs are indeed sociopaths, miscreants, or psychopathic killers.  Inspired by the novels of Caroline Graham, the series stars John Nettles (Bergerac) as the levelheaded Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, with Jason Hughes as his earnest, efficient protg, Detective Sergeant Ben Jones.

For some reason, the DVD sets are broken up from their original seasonal broadcasts. I suggest combining sets 15 and 16.  It makes a more perfect season of MidSomer Murders.

The mysteries in set 15: ""Blood Wedding"" -- Cully's wedding day is fast approaching, but a series of bizarre murders at an upper-class wedding leave Barnaby distracted.
""Shot at Dawn"" -- A long-standing family feud erupts into violence after a disgraced soldier's name is placed on a World War I memorial.
""Left for Dead"" -- Barnaby discovers a potential link between a double murder and a decades-old disappearance in the sleepy town of Dunstan.",1290297600,,1118,5.154696132596685
3952588,4,B002MUAXIA,"I picked this disc up because it looked interesting; little did I know that I came into the series rather late.  It's certainly it's not the best thing to do, start watching a television series years into it.

In any case, this is a fine and fun (if gruesome murders can be fine and/or fun...well, the murders aren't (not for the squeamish)...but John Nettles and company are) series set in the fictional burgs of Midsomer Country.  This picturesque setting in Merry Old England is the home and workplace of Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, his long-suffering wife, and Detective Sergeant Ben Jones.

The only one of the three episodes I can review is 'Blood Wedding' since for some reason that was the only disc in my set!  In any case, Barnaby's daughter is in the full throes of wedding uncertainty (will she or won't she), his wife has caterer problems, and Barnaby has a triple murderer on his hands.  And Jones has a tentative romance on his hands.  And they both have to deal with the insufferable upper class English 'old money' crowd.

Recommended. This is a fun romp in the English countryside with a cast that is very familiar with each other, and consequently quite at ease.  Four stars for 'Midsomer Murders' set 15.",1290211200,,1235,4.706976744186046

3952599,5,B002MUAXIA,"Midsommer murders stays mostly true to it's origins.  This show is still refreshing in that the lead dectective is a happy family man who is out to solve the many murders in his county.  Murders like these do occur in rural england counties in fact englands worst mass shootings took place in a village ,  but of course not in such numbers as the show has, but who cares?  the show is laid back and interesting as ever in this set, the one star ratings people obviously never enjoy character driven mysteries so ignore them.  That's what mm's is character drivin instead of
action driven.  You get a bonus disc of a ten year celebration show that aired back in 97 too although these episodes aired in 98.  The three shows are each mini movies just like every other mm show and it's eccentric and the same as it ever was.  The ep 'blood wedding' ties barnaby's daughters wedding into a murder at a snobby uppercrust families wedding murder to good effect.  The next one 'shot at dawn' also envolves family honor and dysfuntion plus a salute to the great war vets. the last one is also well done mm entertainment.  I think many people take this as a fanasty murder show but in reality most of these characters and killings probably have a real life counterpoint somewhere in the uk. After all hypocrisy, greed, sexual deviance and all other vices are universal.  This show is a international phenomenom for a reason and that's because at it's heart is gallows humour and kernal of truth in spirit but not in numbers of murders in rural england.  the dvd has fine prints of each ep with no artifacts and little extra features just like the last 59 eps dvds had.

""Shot at Dawn""
Episode 60
(1 January 2008)

The story is a cross of a family feud (Romeo and Juliet) and a tontine. So naturally, the first to go is the patriarch. Now all Chief Detective Inspector Barnaby (John Nettles) and Detector Sergeant Jones (Jason Hughes) have to do is figure out who and why and why the unique electronics are involved.

Maybe they ran out of time but the story took a long time introducing the assorted characters and inferring that they could have done it before doing it. An added plus is Arabella Hammond played by Samantha Bond.

""Blood Wedding""
Episode 61
(10 May 2008)

Cully Barnaby (Laura Howard) is about to get married. The wedding plans have their difficulties. Parallel to this her father, DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) who must juggle between his daughter's wedding and a series of suspicious dispatches among the gentry at another nearby wedding. DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) does some independent sleuthing and may have found a love interest.

The series has not lost any steam and may have even gotten better. However, there is a gross scene, which includes a unique use of a hatpin. We are purposely misled by clues being out of place; however we do nave clues and you will see them the on your nest viewing.

A nice added touch to look for is Gavin Troy (Daniel Casey)

""Left for Dead""
Episode 62
(24 May 2008)

A sort of creepy psychic discovers what seem to be unrelated murders. DS Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) must balance his interests and loyalty between his job and his childhood friends, as they become suspects or maybe victims. We have a missing person, old traffic fatality, and several other uncovered secrets. The secrets may or may not be related to the murders. Can DCI Tom Barnaby (John Nettles) sort this out before the next victim? We can take some guesses but may be surprised.

This episode is emotionally darker, even for the Midsummer Murder series story or stories.

3952606,5,B002MUAXIA,"From what I have heard, there are to be changes to this delightful series of Midsomer Murders (I.e., John Needles, as Barnaby, no longer in the show as well as the actresses that have played his  wife, Joyce and daughter, Cully) In this series 15, change, I feel, has already started.

In the first episode called ""Blood Wedding"" Cully gets married; however, her path to the alter is not smooth.  In addition there are, (unrelated to her marriage), `upper-crust"" murders for her father to solve before he can escort her down the aisle.

My very favorite episode in set 15 is the second episode called ""Shot at dawn""--it's wonderful! It is a great ""murder mystery"" that has long feuding families that absolutely hate each other with kind of an underlying ""Romeo and Juliet"" plot.  There is much adultery, sexual deviance, and MOST OF ALL loads of British so-called ""black"" humor from especially the Mayor's wife--I loved it!

All in all, this set is splendid being another fine series to the ""Midsomer Murders"" series; nevertheless, I do sense change is coming.  Be advised that there are only three episodes  (100 minutes each) plus a bonus disc of 40 minutes of reflections from the cast about the series.

By the way, Jason Hughes as Barnaby's ""sidekick"" is very good too.  He and John Needles are so very good together.  In fact Hughes is featured more this time than in series of the past displaying a lot of humor and detective savvy.",1277510400,,1439,4.738955823293173
3952607,5,B002MUAXIA,We have enjoyed these new (to USA) cases just as much as the very first cases.  We have watched the 60 plus we now have on DVD several times.  This is our favorite DVD set.

3952608,2,B002MUAXIA,"What a shame to see a first class detective series run out of gas, capitulating to the low standards of contemporary television.  Here we encounter vomiting, nudity, simulated sex, excessive violence (Want to see an old lady be killed with the world's largest hatpin?  Want to see every act of violence repeated in case you came in late?), and several actors who seem to be on loan from daytime soaps. The box trumpets the capitulation, quoting from the San Francisco Chronicle: ""The British rural version of Law & Order.""

No doubt this seemed necessary: star John Nettles is noticeably getting on in years, as is Jane Wymark, playing his wife. (Why is she given such unflattering wardrobes throughout the series and given lines that make her seem increasingly  shrewish?) With almost all television geared to the 14-year-old male, the people in charge of the series apparently felt compelled to fall in line.  Alas, the extraordinary charm, marvelous casting, and delightful plots of earlier years have disappeared.  Arguably, ""Blood Wedding"" hits a series low.

am doubtful of the 17. AS much as I would love to see it.
I was hoping we would see Cully's entire wedding. I really enjoyed
the Bonus Disc: Super Sleuths. Normally I have never been much
interested in discs about the workings of programs but this one
was so fascinating. The  part about how the strange music sounds
are made by not touching the instrument amazed me. I have noticed
one thing about nearly all of Brit mysteries and dramas; the music
is fantastic. It would be nice if we could entice the composers to
cross ""the pond"" and make beautiful music for us.. I read where
John Nettles will be starring in a new series: Country Matters
