It was awlful, boring, poorly acted, horrible soundtrack and a plot that was both confusing and very thin. Dont waste a dime on this. In fact if you want to buy a blue ray I will sell it cheap.

2629654,4,B000H6SXUG,"Imagine re-living the worst day of your life,
The day you were brutally murdered, over & over again.
Imagine the comedy ""Groundhogs Day"" was a horror movie.
A Puxatany Nightmare!
Well that's just what we have here.
A rock-bottom budget flick that had some genuinely creepy scenes,
tension as thick as my Uncle Rudy's skull,
as well as a liberal helping of gore.
It also features some great characters as well,
one of which my wife kept comparing to me, saying:
""that's soooo you....now do you know what you sound like??"".
to which I responded:
""Yeah I know what I sound like, but he's the best character in the movie ...no?""
This movie also featured some great one-liners:
""It's all about how you feel,
It's all bout how you feel,................when I cut your head off""
The whole time I was watching it I kept thinking;
""Somebody!! Anybody!!, needs to give these guys more money to do an even better film.""
All of this credability however, was blown to bits the minute the conclusion rolled around.
Not only is it a thread-bare twist ending,
but it makes about as much sense as a screen-door on a submarine.
(or an ejection seat on a helipcopter if you prefer)
Yep, what we have here is another ""High Tension"",
yet another member of the ever-growing sub-genre of ""jenga horror""
A great horror premise that's never fully realized,
and sadly laid to waste by a thoughtless conclusion.
All in all it's was well worth the purchase,
but like any meal, at any given, high-priced, french restaurant,
I felt a little cheated at the end.

He turns out to be a terrifying psychopath.  He beats and tortures her.  Just when the horror is unbearable, she wakes up back at the start of the SAME day, and has to relive the whole ordeal.  This happens over and over again for her.  Sort of like a nightmarish ""Ground-hog Day"".  The element that makes this movie even scarier is the fact that it seems all the people closest to her are maybe in on it; her boyfriend, her best-friend, even her mom.

2629658,4,B000H6SXUG,"If you want to know what the plot is about just read the other reviews because I don't think this board needs another summary. Anyway, you have to appreciate Indy films to enjoy this movie. I watched it with a friend of mine who won't watch something unless it's a Paramount blockbuster and he never even gave it a chance. While it's true there's no voluptuous starlet being chased in a wet tank top or million dollar special effects this movie is still fun to watch. The characters (not the plot itself) are far more believable than mainstream slasher flicks. The main character reels you in and makes you root for her because she really is the cute college girl from down the street. That sort of thing. In closing if you can't appreciate low budget filmmakers trying to do their best with what they've got then don't bother watching this one. However, if you like to stray away from the mainstream and the subliminal Pepsi or Hummer commercials that come in them...I think you'd enjoy it.",1186531200,7,991,4.604519774011299
2629659,4,B000H6SXUG,"Low budget does not mean a film has to be bad.  I really enjoyed this film and the ending was something I did not expect.  I thought the ending was pretty clever if not a little cruel.  I understood it but still...  Anyway, Lauren Currie Lewis. who I had never heard of, gave what I thought to be a pretty credible performance, confused, terrified and helpless.  Chris Ferry as the bad guy stalking her was really creepy.  He was charming one moment then satanic the next.  I also thought that John Miller as the sheriff did a better than average job in this film.  He seemed to be concerned, caring, and competent even if he wasn't very helpful.  I liked his character.  My verdict on this one is that it is definately worth watching.  Probably more than once. This is creepy and has one scene where I had to cover my eyes.  An earlier reviewer said this one was closer to 3 and a half stars than four.  That could be right.  Four stars does seem a bit high, but 3 is for sure too low.  Salvage is a good low budget film.",1180656000,14,1022,4.22279792746114

2629661,4,B000H6SXUG,"Kudos to Jeff and Josh Crook, who wrote and directed this taught little (80-minute) thriller and to the cast, especially Lauren Currie Lewis as the frequent victim and Chris Ferry as the killer.

The plot of ""Salvage"" is fairly simple, largely because the film can be described as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day/dp/B00005U8EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day</a>&nbsp;in hell. The film begins when Claire (Lewis), a clerk at a gas station, ends her shift at the station. Her boyfriend is supposed to pick her up to take her to her college classes, but a man named Duke (Ferry) shows up instead, claiming that Claire's boyfriend asked him to pick her up. She accepts the ride and is soon murdered. Almost immediately, she is back at the gas station, ending her shift once again. The gas station here plays essentially the same role ""I Got You Babe"" played in ""Groundhog Day."" In other words, the cycle is fairly simple: end shift at the gas station, get murdered, repeat.

While Claire tries to figure out why Duke keeps killing her and what, if anything, she can do to stop it, she has to deal with a boyfriend who is more interested in getting Claire's friend to join him and Claire in bed than in listening to her problems--even though he seems to be murdered rather frequently himself. The difference, it seems, is that he does not remember his various deaths. Unlike ""Groundhog Day"" and the similar (and, in my opinion, better than ""Groundhog Day"")&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-01/dp/B000BZN1NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12:01</a>, ""Salvage"" does not repeat the same scene every time. Yes, Claire ends up dying again and again, but the world is different each time. The second time, for instance, it really is her boyfriend who picks her up.

Dealing with a world in which only her imminent murder seems certain, Claire tries to enlist others' help, but without much success. The police seem to be little help, and Claire's mother is, in a word, creepy. The clues, however, are there, and the ending pays off by tying the film together (in a montage reminiscent of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Illusionist/dp/B000K7VHQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Illusionist</a>)--at least for those who think about the film carefully enough.

""Salvage"" is an independent film, with all that phrase connotes. Those who insist on glossy, high-tech movies with multi-million dollar budgets probably should not watch this film. But for those, like me, who like to look beyond the major studios because, honestly, there are only so many times you can see the same plot again and again, ""Salvage"" is rewarding. Lewis, as Claire, delivers a solid performance, all the more impressive because it is relatively understated. There are hystrionics, yes, but they come at the right time (as, for example, when her face is about to be removed). Ferry, in the role of Claire's killer, is also solid, also without being over the top. He is also gifted with the best line in the film as he earnestly tells Claire, ""All that matters is what you feel [pause] when I cut your head off."" (I may have misquoted slightly, but the gist is there.)",1174780800,50,3442,5.6518375241779495

2629715,4,B000H6SXUG,"Claire Parker is having a terrible day.  After getting off work from her overnight shift at the convenience store, she heads outside to wait for her boyfriend Jimmy, but when his truck pulls up, it's not Jimmy behind the wheel.  Duke introduces himself, says he works with Jimmy in the salvage yard.  Jimmy couldn't make it, wanted Duke to give Claire a ride.

Um, ok, Claire says, and gets in the truck.  Duke is creeping her out on the drive, but he gets her to her house and she runs inside and locks the door.  Duke knocks, says she dropped her earring in the truck, he'll just leave it on the porch.  The truck drives away and Claire, with the door chained, stretches and strains until she reaches the earring.  Once the door is closed and locked again, she turns toward the kitchen, and freezes.  The back door is opened.

Duke appears, knocks Claire down, punches her repeatedly, drags her bloody and screaming into the basement.  Then Claire wakes up back at the convenience store.  She gets off work from her overnight shift, then heads outside to wait for her boyfriend Jimmy.  Jimmy picks her up and Claire tells him about the weird dream she had.

I had a weird dream, too, Jimmy says.  I dreamed we were having a threesome with your friend Jen.  That's weird, right?  Surely she wouldn't go for it.  You think she'd go for it?  You should ask her.

Claire ignores Jimmy, preoccupied with how intense her dream had been.  So intense, she spends the next couple of days feeling like she's being watched, or like there's something in the house with her.  She keeps seeing Duke in odd places around town.  Maybe, she begins to suspect, what she experienced wasn't a dream after all.  But if it wasn't, how did she get back to the store?  Then one night, Duke attacks her in the store.  She gouges out his eyes and he stops in his attack and says, ""Not yet,"" the disappears into the night.  The police arrive and Claire gives a statement.  Except...well, the police are a little confused because, not only does the surveillance tape show Claire fighting with no one, but Duke Desmond is dead.  The police killed him just a week earlier.

Jeff and Josh Crook's 2006 film SALVAGE was a wonderful surprise of a movie.  I bought it for $5 on a 4-pack of horror movies which also included Tobe Hooper's MORTUARY, Billy Zane's MEMORY, and the godawful BLOODY MARY.  Considering the other movies on this set received an average of 1.6 stars by me, I was expecting more of the same when I sat down to watch SALVAGE.  At only 79 minutes and starring no one I'd ever heard of before, this was the sleeper hit of the set.

Not only was the story engaging, but the acting was pretty good, coupled with a really well-written script.

Lauren Currie Lewis as Claire was up to the task of carrying this movie.  A modern day Nancy Thompson, Claire navigates her weird dreamlike world with equal amounts of caution and determination.  Cody Darbe as Jimmy is just along for the ride, trying to enjoy life, but also trying to be a supportive boyfriend when his girlfriend starts having her breakdown.  Chris Ferry plays Duke Desmond and he's definitely a creeper, but closer to the Buffalo Bill end of the spectrum.

The Crook brothers (I'm guessing they're brothers) have an excellent grasp of building tension and using the camera to further the story without the need for too much expository dialogue.

Overall, SALVAGE was an excellent movie that kept me interested from start to finish.  If any negatives could be found, it would only be through my own carelessness.  When I'm about to review a movie, I like to read up a little on it first, get some behind the scenes info to help focus my attention on the details.  I never read the plot, though.  But in this case, scrolling down the wikipedia page, my eyes fell upon the last couple of lines in the synopsis, which, unfortunately, gave away the ending.  That's not always a bad thing, but with a movie like this, it diminishes the impact just a bit because SALVAGE fits into a very distinct category of movie that, were I to even name a few similar movies, would automatically give away too much.  Suffice it to say, I wish I hadn't seen those few lines of plot description and had, instead, been able to enjoy this ride on my own.

But either way, knowing the ending beforehand has nothing at all to do with the script, the acting, the direction, the camera work, any of that (and I can't forget the soundtrack, provided by Ohio band Devola, which complimented the movie ways unimaginable in something this cheap.  I have to see if they have any albums available!).  The fact remains, SALVAGE was a surprisingly good movie and well worth the time I spent on it.  I wish I could say it's sure to result in a wonderful career for it's writers/directors and it's star.  Unfortunately I have a feeling most people will see it in its association with the other three movies on that ""horror collector's set"" and dismiss it as cheap=bad.  Normally I wouldn't argue that point, but in this case I have to.  SALVAGE may have been made for only $25,000, it may have been shot on digital video, and it may have starred a bunch of unknowns, but the end result easily transcends genre and what we have in the end is just a very good movie that I would gladly watch again.  I can't say that about the films on that set.",1377907200,,5353,4.520833333333333
2629716,4,B000H6SXUG,"An effective little film that delivers the horror freight. Shot in Marietta, Ohio and West Virginia, this film slowly and deliberately builds the tension until the final scenes. Not without it's flaws, but they are few. Those who are expecting buckets of blood will be disappointed, but that aspect of the horror genre, to me, isn't the best one. Watch and be pleasantly surprised.",1371686400,,381,4.96875
2629717,5,B000H6SXUG,"SALVAGE is sort of a hybrid of films like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, JACOB'S LADDER, and TRIANGLE, mixed w/ FARM HOUSE. While heavily supernatural and bleak, it does have its humorous moments as well. Lauren Currie Lewis is phenomenal as Claire, a girl caught in a recurring nightmare that is all too real. Brutal and unforgiving, SALVAGE takes us along as Claire is forced ever deeper into a hideous world that only makes sense at the end. I had fun trying to figure this one out, even though I was wrong!

If you don't get the ending (and a lot of people don't including a very intelligent friend of mine) then it is just a low budget horror film that makes no sense.  If you do get the ending then make sure to watch it again and it becomes all the more interesting.  Just love this film as others I've loaned it to have as well.",1352246400,3,801,4.3133333333333335

...I have to say, I'm kicking myself for not watching it sooner.

There's plenty of plot synopsis' on these pages already, and it's really something that you need to experience without foreknowledge, so I'm not going to go there.  I am going to say that I found this little indie flick very impressive for the budget (or lack thereof) it had.  I found the acting, especially for an outing such as this, to be convincing and powerful.  Lauren Lewis, as our protagonist, was convincing in her depiction of both teenaged defiance and equally so in her portrayal of fear and confusion, without being over the top.  The villian of our piece, in my mind, was chilling; he was a rather affable guy, normal in appearance; and while he was perhaps a bit odd in personality, there is nothing overtly 'sinister' about him in the beginning...much in the vein of a Norman Bates (and Chris Ferry, in my opinion, channeled a young Bill Paxton in his performance).

The plot, while not entirely original, had enough of a new spin to make it enjoyable.  It was well-paced and the clues to the mystery were subtle yet noticeable; some images and effects were genuinely spooky, and they were fitting and well-done considering the monetary constraints.

A lot of people seem confused with the ending; I myself, whilst I wasn't entirely correct in my deductions, found the ending understandable and satisfying.

For a good, spooky little movie that gets you thinking, ""Salvage"" is a good investment for the price you pay...fans of indie horror should definitely give this one a chance...I'm happy that I did.",1285804800,5,1886,4.7370030581039755

Since this is the sort of film that is most entertaining when you are trying to figure out what's happening in the story yourself, I won't go into much detail.  I've seen hundreds of horror films, and I can promise you that this one will keep you rivted to the screen. There is some blood, some scenes of extreme violence, but, the most effective manifestation of horror in this film comes from the nightmare of the central victim not understanding what's happening to her, as she seems to be reliving the agonizing torment of her own vicious murder over and over. Lauren Currie Lewis does a brillint job of portraying a terrified, confused, and shaken teenager trying desperately to solve the mystery of her recurring horror. There are hints dropped along the way, clues that slowly give you some measure of understanding..., but there is a startling twist at the end.., if you haven't figured it out by then, you will be surprised.

There is only a slight amount of gore, and no nudity. There is an intense scene where Claire is being brutally beaten which made me feel a bit uneasy.

I am not going to rehash the plot too much; many other reviewers have already done so.  Basically, a young woman named Claire played by Lauren Currie Lewis (who looks like a young Alicia Silverstone and young Kim Raver combo) is a convenient store clerk who works the graveyard shift.  Well Claire appears to have a problem; no matter what she does she keeps bumping into ""Duke"" (Chris Ferry).

Duke isn't your normal guy; as a matter of fact he is rather morbid. The problem Claire has is she keeps getting ""killed"" by Duke.  Yes I said ""keeps""; once she is killed she ends up starting her day all over again.  Alternately, no matter how Claire's day goes she will bump into Duke and is going to meet her demise.  This film sort of has a ""Groundhog's Day"" feel to it, but with an ominous and austere distortion.

The acting is pretty solid; Lewis does a pretty good job as the lead and for the most part is believable (given the circumstances of the plot).  Chris Ferry's performance as the psychopath is a little hit and miss.  There are times he is creepy and then down right daft. The one character who was a little insipid was the guy who played Claire's boyfriend.  He's antics were crude and vexing which I felt did nothing for the plot, if anything it brought the movie down a level.

This being an independent movie, it had a ""made on a shoe string budget"" feel to it.  Honestly, I liked it and found it very refreshing.  There were some elements in this movie were a little ""silly"", but I don't think it influence the final product.  Digress, I have seen many independent horror movies and more times than I can count they fall back on tons of nudity, profanity, blood and guts and lack of plot.  Not that I have ANYTHING against the former ""techniques"" of horror movie making, but it is invigorating to see something a little different.

Overall I found this to be a nice little gem that was well written and directed.  I also found the score to be hypotonic (the bands were sub par).  The film seems a little disconnected while it is being revealed, but ties up all loose ends before the credits roll.  I would recommend this movie to any horror movie buff.",1266537600,3,2511,4.446389496717725

2629794,2,B000H6SXUG,"Salvage: 4 out of 10. Groundhog Day meets a Christian Coalition horror film. Okay maybe it is not that bad. Nevertheless, it is close.

Our protagonist Claire (played by Alicia Silverstonesque Lauren Currie Lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (Chris Ferry who is quite menacing and brutal). I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream' Or was it? (Cue music)

The basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot (Done quite well the first time) is repeated over and over again. Now since Claire wakes up after repeatedly being killed and clearly every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality; I simply just stopped caring what happened to Claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together.

I was rooting for a sance (which honestly could have made sense) but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings (Think The Village or Below). Yup, the film collapses faster than Donnie Darko's directors cut. All the great twist endings in horror movies such as The Sixth Sense, the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, or even Happy Birthday to Me worked because the audience was simply not expecting it. (Heck even the canoe ending in the original Friday the 13th was worth a jolt)

Salvage, on the other hand, screams twist ending with every scene change. Other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack, (Though the featured songs were decent), the obvious time padding (Claire doing the dishes, Claire's mother's subplots), and the way Claire says ""hello is anyone there"" every time she thinks there is a serial killer around like she was playing some sort of masochistic game of Marco Polo.

In addition, some of the secondary acting roles (In particular Claire's mother played by Maureen Olander, who resembles a Mary Kay zombie) show the first time actor, low budget roots.

Salvage is both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough, it does keep your interest; if only to see how they are going to fix this mess. Problem is they fail",1259280000,5,2065,4.73816155988858
2629824,1,B000H6SXUG,"Really a terrible movie.  The only reason we watched past the halfway point was cause my girlfriend didn't want me to feel bad about spending money on this movie.  Ironiclly she has no problem making fun of the movie enough not to let me pick movies.  There was one funny part, but besides that the cheap price wasn't worth it.  Very bad.",1249257600,6,338,4.403225806451613
2629825,3,B000H6SXUG,"It's apparent right away that Salvage had little budget to work with.  Given that criteria, production values from acting, directing, writing, to editing are all very respectable.  The premise is a little different than the standard low-budget flick and a creepy atmosphere is effectively set within the first few minutes.  The main character has either been killed or is having some serious nightmares or delusions as she is being haunted by a serial killer.  In fact the first two acts are fairly captivating and I was thinking Salvage was on its way to a solid 4 star rating.  Things get a bit dicey and meandering as the films ventures into Jacob's Ladder or Sixth Sense territory.  Unlike those superior films, the writers seem to run out of clever ideas and while resolution is given at the very end, I found the climax somewhat unsatisfying.  I recommend Salvage for fans of low-budget horror (you can certainly do much worse), but most mainstream movie viewers might tend to lose interest about half-way through.",1245369600,2,1020,4.9298245614035086

It features an interesting plot that at least you will not have guessed after 5 minutes of viewing. even when you think that you have it, guess again. So on the plot alone I would rate it 4 stars, but the weak production and acting only rates 2 stars. For the price ($5.00) I was not disappointed.",1231459200,,574,4.088495575221239

Without giving too much away, I can truly say this film had a twist ending that didn't reveal itself until the last two minutes of the film.  Along the way I had speculated a few times about what was going on and was extremely wrong.  I will continue to look for films made by this group of people, and I am thrilled to have found what one day will probably be considered an underground classic.

It was very intriguing and fast paced with many shocking moments.  It is definitely a grade B horror movie and this is not meant as an insult.  It shows that the genre can put out good films.

The lead actress was very believable through out the film.  Other acting varied but none was terrible.  It did have me on the edge of my seat at times.  I really was rather impressed that this small, simple film could have so much impact.

People have mentioned the ending and it was the only disappointing part of the film for me.  I never get confused by films but this one did render me very confused.

8137108,4,B000H6SXUG,"From time to time a lesser known and low budget film can actually capture ones interest and they can find that that movie says so much to them personally in terms of simple imagination and ideas that are in some way relatable.  This was one of those movies that I discovered in one of those sets of multiple obscure horror movies.  From experience I have found that those movies seriously suck 9 times out of 10.  Once in a rare while there is one that actually makes for a good watch and Salvage is one of those movies.
Anyone who knows me knows that I generally speaking, completely despise horror movies and thriller movies that rely on plot twists and symbolism, but surprisingly this movie actually rose above that usual haze.

The movie focuses on a beautiful 19 year old girl named Claire Parker.  Claire goes to school, does the night shift at a convenient store, and hangs out with her boyfriend Jimmy and at times her also beautiful best friend Jennifer.  Claire also lives with her mother of whom doesn't seem to be around much.  Everything was as usual for Claire until one day after work as she waits for her boyfriend Jimmy she soon runs afoul with this mysterious serial killing psycho named Duke Desmond.  Duke has a way of showing up unexpectedly and Claire constantly goes from being victimized by the psycho to either waking up perfectly alive in either her job or in school.  Claire is nothing short of perplexed and frightened needing to find out the mystery of who or what Duke is and whether or not she truly is alive or just a ghost and not aware of it.  She also needs to be certain as to who to trust as well.

What makes this movie so watchable and stimulating as I see it is, the location is very isolated and out of the middle of nowhere primarily, making for a claustrophobic and nowhere to run sort of feel to it.  Another thing is that you never know quite what's going to happen next or when.  The whole mystery as to what going on is a big thing as well.  True it messes with your head but in a mentally stimulating way.  I find the characters to be both interesting and relatable.  I have actually gone to school with smalltown kids so these characters have a special familiarity to me.  The cast is quite attractive as well.  Claire and Jennifer are for sure two knockout beauties for example.  Without a mask, being silent, or looking weird, Duke actually proves quite intimidating.  He has that bullying prison cellmate thing going for him.

What keeps this movie fascinating and enjoyable to me is that I see the characters, the surroundings, and the events in this movie to be symbolic.  I see the character of Claire to be symbolic of a any person who takes everyday a day at a time, believes that things are going well enough in her life, and a person that doesn't ever think that anything bad is likely to happen to her.  To me Jimmy is symbolic of the kind of person that only believes what's right in front of him, who tries to be in control of any situation, that takes life for granted, and just lives in the moment.  I see Duke as the symbol of pure dread and a lack of security, a symbol of anything that could go terribly wrong if given a chance, a symbol of the kind of evil that is all over this world that can't be completely avoided, a complete antithesis of peace that brings about nothing but chaos.  Claire's mother to me is symbolic of someone who's just into her own thing and doesn't concern herself with anything major.  Finally Jennifer is symbolic of someone who knows that things can go wrong but is very optimistic about the best possible turn out.  As for the town and surroundings well they all symbolize that decidedly false sense of security as well as that ironic feeling of dread and isolation.

All in all, while this movie is not heavy on gore and has no actual sex scenes or nudity, what it does have is a masterfully crafted mystery, an attractive cast, an unpredictable ending, plenty of suspense and eerie scares, believable smalltown teens, an abrasive, frightening, and all too determined serial killer, the loss of feeling carefree and secure, relatable characters, and above all the whole element of not truly being able to tell how it will all end just makes it all worthwhile. The Blu ray transfer is great and besides it having  3-d like feel to it the look to it is effectively dream-like.
PS That creepy and eerie scene where you see Duke far in the background opening his mouth wide to let out a freaky scream will always give me the chills.",1475280000,,4528,4.481120584652863

8137112,5,B000H6SXUG,"After a disturbing title sequence establishing dread and foreboding in a salvage yard, the film proper begins with Claire closing out her graveyard shift at the convenience store. She is to be picked up by her boyfriend and driven home, but instead, someone else, who identifies himself as ""Duke"" is driving her boyfriend's truck. After an unsettling ride home during which Duke makes increasingly overt sexual comments about her, Claire closes herself into the safety of her house, but Duke shows up at her door again, claiming she has dropped an earring. Claire refuses to let him in, and he drops the earring on her front porch and apparently leaves. Claire spends several agonizing moments crouched in the doorway retrieving the earring, but upon successfully recapturing it and pulling the door closed, finds her back door has swung open. Duke has entered the house from the rear and proceeds to brutally murder Claire.

Claire awakens at the convenience store again, and all seems well. She decides that she has had a bad dream. She begins to repeat her day, except this time her boyfriend does come to pick her up, and she makes it home and to school. However, unsettling hints begin to appear. The sequence of events once again leads to a moment where Claire is being murdered, and she again awakens in the convenience store. As each sequence leads towards her death, she hears from time to time people who she trusts talking just out of earshot about how she is ""catching on."" Finally she puts together the clues and realizes that not only has Duke been killed by the local police, but that she herself is missing and presumed dead, as is her boyfriend Jimmy.

In the end, it is revealed, that Duke Desmond's spirit occupies Claire's physical body: And he is in hell reliving the brutal murder of Claire over and over again as eternal punishment. Just before the end credits, Claire again awakens in the convenience store.",1420848000,3,1931,4.813253012048193
