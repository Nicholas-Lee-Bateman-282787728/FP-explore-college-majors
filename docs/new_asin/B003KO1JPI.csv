8398811,5,B003KO1JPI,"So good I had to buy it twice. This is just the best time for drummers. When I started there was Stick Control, Syncopation and J. Burns Moore.",1410652800,,143,4.142857142857143
8398812,5,B003KO1JPI,"This DVD is great! I didn't know what to expect, given the Japanese backing band and relatively low production values, but ""Funk R&B Drumming"" is both delightful and informative. Gadson himself is completely charming in a down-home, unscripted way.  He is also utterly convincing. He has played the gamut of African-American music and has helped to pioneer several of its styles. His groove is deep and strong, eschewing flash and ""drumistics""... and the band is right there with him! If you're interested blues, R&B or funk drumming, this DVD will give you both a history lesson and a great lesson in how to groove. Highly recommended.",1290816000,6,636,5.0
