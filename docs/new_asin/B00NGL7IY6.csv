6649729,4,B00NGL7IY6,"4 stars only because of the really slow shipping time. Took almost a week before it was even prepared to ship.
The movie itself is nice. My son loves Blaze and we have all the episodes on DVR. This tape has 3-4 episodes put together as one continuous movie with some new fillers to bridge the gaps. I basically purchased it to have blaze handy in the car on long trips. This will serve that need just fine.",1424908800,4,406,4.217948717948718

6649739,5,B00NGL7IY6,"My 2 year old is obsessed with monster trucks lately.  That is all he wants to watch!  In fact, the only way I got him potty trained was by buying my monster truck underwear.

I  bought his movie for him to watch in the van and he LOVES it.  It is on repeat in our car.  I LOVE that it is interactive.  The movie has the kids yell out when they see things and also asks them questions like which is more 5 or 7.  Anything that incorporates monster trucks with learning gets na A+ in my book.  If you have a young monster truck fan then you should get this movie!

This DVD is unique because it contains 1 episode that has never aired on NickJr, Blaze of Glory. I suspect this is the very 1st ever episode. I think we caught a glimpse (clip) on YouTube Kids but we have definitely never seen it on tv. That in itself makes this DVD worth it. The other episode is a good one too.

Wished this included more than 2 episodes like others have already stated.  Otherwise, its exactly what we needed.  A total of approx 1 hour runtime, our boys would easily watch a couple times before needing to be swapped with another DVD :)",1440806400,2,330,4.377049180327869
6649791,5,B00NGL7IY6,"reading some of the reviews have me stumped. how can you possibly think 1 dvd (which can hold only 1.5-2 hours) will have an entire season of a tv show? at most it can have 4(30 minute) episodes

find your personal favorite tv show and see how many dvds come with a complete season of it. besides that, this doesnt even advertise as a season of the tv series.

i cant remember how many episodes are on it, but its at least an hour. with my son watching it while im doing things its plenty long enough.

the quality both video and sound are great

i will say it would have been nice to have at least 1.5 hours of show and it really should but without doing research i think this was probably one of the first they made for blaze. they might not have known how well it would sell",1440374400,,777,4.092105263157895

6649801,5,B00NGL7IY6,"I bought this on a whim looking for something new to give me a break from Bob the Builder, Handy Manny, and Curious George. We had never seen it before, but after reading other reviews I decided to give it a try. I waited for the price to come down and paid $9.96 for it because a few reviews gave low ratings due to the DVD only having 2 episodes, it is totally worth it. I have never seen my toddler so happy and half way through the first episode he was clapping and yelling ""Let's Blaze"" which is the catch phrase for the monster truck Blaze to go faster. I actually enjoyed it as well and was pleased that it is a DVD that he will continue to learn things from as he grows older.
THIS IS A GREAT BUY!!!
