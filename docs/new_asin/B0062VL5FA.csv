4933986,5,B0062VL5FA,This show really brings back memories. I would recooomned it to anyone who loves music and doesn't mind some unrealistic resolutions to problems.

4933989,4,B0062VL5FA,"...for anyone owning the Rhino Box Set!

The problem here is that NINETEEN of the 26 episodes included in this set are totally redundant for anyone like myself who has already purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jem-Season-3-Part-1/dp/B0002M5TP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jem - Season 3, Part 1</a>&nbsp;by Rhino Home Video ( 2004 ).  This is NOT to fault this set or its producers, SHOUT Factory, who seem to have done a good job with the material at hand, well-described in reviews for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jem-and-the-Holograms-The-Truly-Outrageous-Complete-Series/dp/B005BUA1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series</a>&nbsp;which contains all three so-called ""seasons"" of the original 65-episode series.  Good as the previous Rhino set is, this one will render it pointless!

The inherent problem comes from the way predecessor Rhino decided to divide their sets, then running out of money and/or thereby losing the rights to Jem ( likely a combination of both ) prior to releasing it complete.  Rhino's incomplete release ends with the episode Mardi Gras, which is the penultimate episode on disc 3 of SHOUT's four-disc set.  Unfortunately, the seven episodes ""in limbo"" include three of the most important in the development of major characters: Out of the Past, wherein we learn the story of Jerrica and Kimber's parents and the beginnings of both Starlight Music and the Starlight House for girls, the first of which are Aja and Shana; and the two-part Hollywood Jem which deals with a double proposal from BOTH Kimber's longtime admirers, Jeff and Shawn! Completionists like me are thereby forced to buy this set in addition to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jem-And-The-Holograms-Season-Three/dp/B007RMQ4RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jem And The Holograms: Season Three</a>&nbsp;in order to FINALLY have all these classic episodes!

However, a caveat to ANYONE attempting like myself to achieve that particular goal is that the ""extras"" - the CD-ROM Jem Production Bible, interviews with Jem's creators, voice cast, and fans, etc. - seem ONLY to be available in the complete 65-episode box set mentioned above; the sole extra on this and the last set is the ""Video Jukebox"" feature that allows you to play the songs separately.  It should go without saying that anyone completely lacking any DVD version of Jem will ultimately do themselves a favor by ignoring this and the other separate sets of Seasons 1 and 3 and invest in the Complete Series in the first place!",1342396800,12,2674,6.018421052631579
4934000,3,B0062VL5FA,The only problem with this is. I didn't get the 3rd disc. I ended up getting 2 disc of disc 1.,1412467200,,94,3.5238095238095237
4934001,5,B0062VL5FA,My children are as excited about this purchase as I am... and they are grown... Can't wait to watch..,1409443200,,101,4.368421052631579

We may have to put it in the safe........ it is priceless!",1402272000,,161,4.0625
4934004,5,B0062VL5FA,"Seriously, if I had known all these shows would come out when I was adult, I would have had much more productive Saturdays as a child.  Anyway, the quality is good and it is the same old Soap Opera-esque Jem you know and love.  It gave me the great opportunity to introduce my daughter to such an awesome show.  Just don't let your kids know about Integrity collection that recently released high end dolls from Jem that are beautiful but-ever-so expensive.  Go back to your chidhood and enjoy a Jem marathon today!",1394496000,,515,4.565217391304348
4934005,4,B0062VL5FA,"We already had season one, but we could never find season two anywhere else. So we finally decided to order it. It got here right away and we didn't have to wait long. The second season is so exciting, this is one of our favorite old cartoons.",1388016000,,243,4.191489361702128
4934006,5,B0062VL5FA,"Bought this for my niece, I do remember my sister watching it in the 80's and she still had some old VHS episodes that my nieces watched and liked so I bought this for her/them.

I can't comment much on the show itself as I'm not exactly the target audience, I can however say that like most 80's kids shows it's pretty ""wholesome"" which I enjoy, Other than that the DVD quality is good, clear picture, sound is good, the artwork on the case is just as in the picture, if you have little nieces or daughters this is something I think they will like.",1385942400,,549,4.228571428571429
4934007,5,B0062VL5FA,"I am so glad that despite Rhino canceling it's original contract to rerelease the classic Jem TV show, someone else picked up the ball. With renewed cult status, and comic cons presenting a new line of figures, there is no better time. I always liked the gutsy idea to use female as opposed to male rockers. Helmed by creator Christy Marx who wrote also for Transformers and GI Joe, this series I found fun for kids regardless of gender, and as an adult, I still enjoy watching it.",1359849600,,481,4.4772727272727275

I used to watch Jem as a child with my cousin and younger sister and this transported me backed to the 80's and my 4-5year old self wanting to be a Jem girl. Yes as an adult parts of this is corny, but its the nostalgic element attached that has me loving it. Jem was to us back then what Miami Vice was to the older persons in this era.",1430006400,,401,3.7857142857142856
