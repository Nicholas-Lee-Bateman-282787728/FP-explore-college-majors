I contacted the vendor and they replied quickly in assisting me with how to adjust the region.  I first saw this film in the theater in 1965 while studying Judo.  This very controversial film was a remake of the 1941 version of Judo Saga and it took me 4 years to locate the 1965 version under a this name which was released in 1999 in France.  On a side note the Toho Production Company and a Mifune family member indicated that this film did not exist.  Yet it was listed in the movie books for Kurosawa films.
