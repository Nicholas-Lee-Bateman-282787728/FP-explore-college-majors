4187765,3,B003S897MI,"This DVD has a five short films.  Think British-Indie-B-horror-movies.  A group of friends each tell a different horror story, each declaring their tale of gore is even worse.

Less is More was particularly gruesome at the end as a woman who was always obsessed with being an amputee gets her wish.  It made my stomach a bit queasy.

Wolf Cry was my favorite.  A 19 year old wannabe filmmaker who lives in his head and sees everyone and everything around him as monsters and other scary creatures is forced by his single mother to do better in school and get a job.  As this short story progresses he can't seem to control his imagination and everywhere he looks there are ghouls after him.  In the end it has some deadly results!  Since I tend to have a very vivid imagination I could really identify with this young man in some ways.

In the final part of the film, Cromwell's Curse, the group talks about a local haunted house and the curse centered on it.  Is it all just fiction?  Or could it be real?  The group soon finds out...",1285027200,,1035,4.412698412698413
4187766,3,B003S897MI,"""Tales from the Dead"" is a trilogy of supernatural tales narrated by a mysterious female psychic Tamika when she picks up a female hitchhiker. The stories all revolve around the premise of greed and what happens to humans when they give in to greed. There is also a plot revolving around the hitchhiker herself, and she learns too late that it is not mere coincidence that led Tamika to give her a lift.

The stories are actually quite interesting, though there is an element of predictability in them. The production is obviously low-budget and the movie itself seems like a home-made production with rather grainy pictures and less than credible special effects/make-up. I would have given it two stars if not for the interesting stories. There are many other J-horror anthologies out there, and this is a rental at best. The dialogue is in Japanese with English subtitles. For those who'd like to watch some J-horror anthologies, check out:

4187767,5,B003S897MI,"""Tales from the Dead"" is more in the line of ""The Twilight Zone.""  It is suspenful, leading reader to consider his/her own values and priorities. The acting, music and plots hold viewer's attention leaving one with the desire to see it more than once.",1269648000,2,251,4.704545454545454
4187768,3,B003S897MI,"This movie is in the style of current Japanese horror movies, and consists of a series of tales told by psychic as she drives a woman hitchhiker.  The production is low-budget, but the stories are entertaining.  The movie is in Japanese with English subtitles, and was shot on location - in California!  This is most obvious in a cemetery scene - no typical Japanese cemetery looks like that. Most of the actors have typical Japanese names but don't look typically Japanese.  More telling is their Japanese: Native Japanese speakers will immediately recognize that these actors do not speak phonetically the Japanese of native speakers, and may be sansei or other asians reasonably fluent in Japanese.",1269648000,3,701,5.069565217391304

8404081,1,B003S897MI,"This is a 75 minute film with four stories, of which one briefly has to do with ""the dead"" and none have a dead looking girl with a chainsaw. This is low budget indie horror, the type where one surname fills almost all the credit spots. Indeed, it appeared credits were added just so they could add the same name over and over.

The stories themselves didn't go anywhere. No clever twists or decent acting. Expected substandard effects, and writing that was horrible in both dialogue and plot. The writer simply didn't know how to tell and end a story to keep the viewer engaged.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief nudity?",1410134400,,618,4.609090909090909

8404086,4,B003S897MI,"Horror fans will revel in the five tales ghoulishly featured in this film ""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore.""  The five friends who gather to exchange horror stories do a hauntingly good job of scaring one another while keeping the viewer gripped to their seats waiting for the next grim story. Halloween fans will definitely see this film as more of a treat. The only drawback is the noticeably poor budget, which becomes apparent in some of the peak moments of fright, but it is more of a B horror film. Regardless of production pitfalls the film is entertaining and thrilling at the same time.",1286409600,,622,4.654545454545454
8404087,3,B003S897MI,"This is a nifty little horror film that consists of several shorter films framed by a group of British young adults getting together on Halloween night to party and scare each other with DVDs they've brought--sort of a Canterbury Tales of blood, gore and fear.  There's a great deal of energy and inventiveness here, but nobody will confuse these shorts with the slick Hollywood variety.  On the other hand, the filmmakers have obviously seen a lot of films, and aren't shy about borrowing.  If you're a big horror buff, you'll appreciate the references; if not, you may just have the vague feeling you've seen this before.  The tales don't exactly have conclusions sometimes, just endings, which was an interesting, non-traditional choice, I think.  I recommend this as an example of what you can do on a limited budget with an ensemble group of actors and filmmakers and a ton of effort and imagination.",1286236800,,905,4.888888888888889
8404088,4,B003S897MI,"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects.",1285718400,,1271,5.125603864734299
