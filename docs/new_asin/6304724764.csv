922450,5,6304724764,"I've seen this movie on VHS, and I will soon buy the DVD, beacause it ROCKS! Jackie plays a misbehaver at a kung-fu shool, always tormented by teachers. With the help of the five freaky ghosts, he learns incredible  kung-fu, needed to destroy a theif who stole the school's most precious  book. The comedy stuff is really corny, but thats what makes it so funny.  The fighting is really good. Check this movie out, it's a kung-fu classic  (and it's cheap!).",913852800,,457,4.604938271604938
922563,5,6304724764,"I love this film!!! Excellent!!! Maybe some of you want to watch a kung fu film to see nothing but pointless fight scenes, but I for one like to see some other things in my kung fu flicks.  Styles for one, check.  A little kung fu humor, check.  A little more developed plot then just the regular ol' ""you killed my family member now i must get revenge"", check.  This film is extremely well done and I recommend it to anyone who considers themselves to be a Jackie Chan fan. This is a must have!!!",1128729600,5,497,4.2
922564,4,6304724764,"I said what the heck and rented this movie because I like kung fu movies. well This movie had a good story line like most old school kung fu movies. And great fight scenes. Also I like that jackie chan emphasized less comedy in this movie and foucuses on kung fu unlike now. The only draw back is that its old, poor quality , and the special effects are ridiculous or it would have gotten 5 stars.",1094860800,2,397,4.1688311688311686
922565,1,6304724764,"If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen this movie and wants to, be warned: Spiritual Kung Fu is NOT a flick that should be taken seriously. If however, you are one who likes DUMB humor as one reviwer put it, then you may actually enjoy this. As for me, I have seen some good Jackie Chan action comedies (Rush Hour, Mr. Nice Guy) but this one tops the charts on the level of pathetic.",1076803200,,389,4.131578947368421
922566,3,6304724764,"Sure, the panning and the transfer of this movie may not of been so great, but I enjoyed the movie anyway.  I certainly don't get these movies for Hollywood style or quality.  The 5 clown like ghost threw me off, since I would not of expected to see that in a Kung Fu movie.  I liked some of the close ups as it allows you to see how to do the strike better.  The Five Animal Style is classic Shao-Lin and this movie gives you a good idea of how it looks and how to execute it.  Corny, yet funny, I give this move 3 stars. And learning Shao-Lin Kung Fu myself, I find Spiritual Kung Fu educational.",1049241600,5,598,4.033898305084746
922567,3,6304724764,"This film is very vulgar. A meteor crashes to Earth, releasing 5 spirits who teach Jackie Spiritual Kung Fu also known as Five Fists Style. Jackie uses these otherworldly techniques to retrieve a stolen kung fu manual for the Seven Fists Style.",1037059200,,244,4.833333333333333
922568,5,6304724764,"This movie showcases the finest points of Jackie Chan's ... kicking, almost ninjistic abilities.  For the first half hour, you WILL be confused and wondering what the hell those ghosts are supposed to be.  But from tehn on, the martial artistry and action packed kung fu never ends!  The styles of the snake, dragon, tiger, crane and leopard combine to form an awesome fighting force capable of an obscene degree of ... whooping destruction.  This movie is the coolest thing ever... so cool I want to head butt my dog so hard that we both pass out, and then kick my mom right in the face!  Watch it NOW!",1026172800,2,603,4.495412844036697
922569,1,6304724764,"I'm a huge Jackie fan, but this movie was insufferable. I don't mind the weak story; I'm here for the fighting. But the problem is that this transfer was incompetantly done. The movie crops most of the fight scenes, and the inexplicable camera work is hightened by the miserable panning. The colors are washed-out, the audio is terrible, and the source film is badly blemished and scratched.
If, someday, there is a retouched, remastered release, I'll covet it for my collection. Meanwhile, don't waste your time on this one.",1011657600,2,525,4.910112359550562
922570,5,6304724764,If you are a Jackie chan fan or if you just are on a mission to see every kung fu movie ever (those people do exist) then you have to see this film. It features Jackie Chan as a ..... THE PLOT DOESN'T MATTER!SEE THE FILM!!,998006400,,222,3.847826086956522
922571,3,6304724764,"I like the movie despite its mediocre acting and fight scenes.  ""Spiritual Kung Fu"" does have its moments (not that many of them though).  I doubt most people would like this film, and I would only recommend it to the most die hard Jackie Chan fans.",995760000,,249,4.391304347826087

7877036,4,6304724764,A Wonderful movie. Everything I remember it to be. I have enjoyed it from the first time I saw it VHS,1392336000,,101,3.857142857142857
7877037,5,6304724764,"I've only seen a part of this film, which I accidentally found on tv in S. Korea where I'm currently living. (I don't understand either Chinese or the Korean subtitles, but I couldn't surf on.) It's hard not to immediately like Jackie's physicality and comedy. Forget that it doesn't have all the camera tricks of today--look at the skill of Chan, and even the comic interplay with the five ridiculous ghosts (who seem to know they're ridiculous, which is also part of the subtle humor of the movie). I'm leaving for Hong Kong in a few days, and I definitely have on my shopping list to find the best copies of early Chan movies. Anyone who either enjoys good comedy (yes, it's screwball, but it's not totally stupid)or can appreciate Chan's physical skill will enjoy seeing this film over and over, especially whenever the world begins to seem a bit overwhelming. Chan's the little man unafraid to take on big problems.",1299369600,,920,4.720496894409938
7877038,4,6304724764,"This is a classic film in Jackie's early career and a personal favorite. Love this film bit this dvd, albeit manufacturer or seller, is a bit choppy and some original screen shots are cut off leaving it seem like a pirated copy. I originally saw this film from a friend who owned it in a three vhs pack so i know its off. Other than that delivery was prompt and hassle free.",1294012800,,374,4.208333333333333
7877039,3,6304724764,"this is about what I expected from a definite B- movie of Jackie's early career, so the nonsensical plot didn't bother me. however, this is a full screen DVD, and it is very obvious when in many scenes the characters with dialogue are cut out of frame. so the transfer and image quality leaves a lot to be desired.",1278115200,2,314,4.338983050847458
7877040,3,6304724764,"This format is not widescreen and therefore, you lose 30% of the movie because you cant see the sides! It would have been a great vintage Jackie Chan movie, but the formatting ruined it for me.",1229904000,,193,4.388888888888889
7877041,3,6304724764,"I watched this movie with my sons (ages 9 and 7) and could only handle about 30 minutes of it because it was just so hokey, but my boys really enjoyed it, and had fun making up their own Shaolin moves for the rest of the night.  They called me back in for the fight scenes later in the movie, and those are certainly worth watching because they are not bloody messes but are instead really intricately choreographed displays of martial arts technique.  One other thing worth noting: it seemed as though the camera had zoomed in too far because it cut out important parts of the scenes.  I didn't see an option to change it from full screen to wide screen, but if there is a way to do that, it would make a big difference.",1168646400,,721,4.248175182481752
