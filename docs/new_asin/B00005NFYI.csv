1634039,5,B00005NFYI,Another addition to my collection of Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett. Best of all Sherlock Holmes actors.,1265500800,,107,5.352941176470588
1634040,2,B00005NFYI,"I was surprised when I saw how high the avarage customer rating was for this DVD.  Then I thought, maybe it is a cult favorite among people who like campy, bad acting.  But, after reading the reviews, I see that a lot of people really like it.

So, why didn't I like it?  I thought the way Jeremy Brett plays Sherlock Homes was too strange.  I know Holmes is meant to be eccentric, but the way Brett speaks is too choppy, kind of angry, and annoying to me.  It seemed very affected and unnatural.  Dr. Watwon comes off as really dopey.

The scenery and sets were good, most of the other actors were good, but this was not my idea of how Sherlock Holmes should be done.",1216252800,,668,4.2047244094488185
1634041,3,B00005NFYI,"Here are two episodes from the better part of the series.
The Speckled Band is considered by both Doyle himself and by most fans to be the best of the Holmes stories. I have read it a couple of times, with the original illustrations by Paget, and have watched the excellent Granada production.
Great care was taken to get this one right, and the actor who plays Roylott looks uncannily like the Paget drawing. Everything is as it should be for the pickiest Holmes fan.
I myself do not understand why this story is anyone's favorite. It is so full of holes that simply can't be ignored. Snakes can not be trained like dogs, and certainly don't come calling after a whistle. And any fatal fang marks would be instantly visible against the alabaster skin of the victim. Also, I find it impossible to believe that neither of the girls knew that the rope that hung from the ceiling and right over the pillow of the bed had no purpose, and that in the two years that they had access to the room one of them would not have tugged at it once or twice.
The rest of it works well enough, and the scene where Sherlock whacks the snake is memorable. This is undoubtedly a great story regardless of its faults, and seems to have an extra element of creepiness not present in most of the other stories.
As for the Creeping Man, I thought it was a boring tale, but very well done production-wise. I have viewed it once, but don't remember much except for the longish flashback scenes, and a wandering around in the storyline of the type that would come to plague the later entries of this series.",1214870400,,1581,4.417808219178082
1634042,3,B00005NFYI,"Comfortable stereotypes.  The detective genius, always perfectly sure of himself and always right.  The fuddy duddy Dr Watson, foil for humor.  There is no reality in this tv series, only stereotypes, but the stories are fairly entertaining.

Episode 1 is about a murder that takes place in a confined area surrounded by a moat.  Holmes determines the truth of the matter shortly before the one hour time limit for the episode is up.  Congratulations, old boy.

Episode 2 features a pretty girl for a change.  She is a stereotype American cowgirl from Texas, Annie Oakley played for comedy.  Someone was murdered, and the body was left in her room along with the tomahawk she uses in her wild west show touring Europe.  It goes without saying that she is innocent of the murder, and Holmes figures out who the guilty party is shortly before the hour is up.  Pip pip, old chap.

Episode 3 has a ghost punching Dr Watson in the eye, then coming back to tweak his nose.  Holmes uses his ESP (or his foreknowledge of the script) to determine that a specific painting has been stolen from a museum, and sure enough, just as the hour is about to end, he has solved the crime.

A good detective story depends on realism and detail.  This series has neither.  The turns of the plot usually make no sense at all.  This series is just a vehicle to give us the two stereotyped characters in some sort of action or other.  It is a good example of the silly mediocrity of mid 1950s television.  Not that current tv is better.

Since none of the shows was particularly good, my favorite episode was the second one, in contrast with the other review on this site.  That's because the girl was cute to look at.  The plots of all three were pretty sad.  The silly stereotyped characters weren't bad to watch.  It was okay.",1122508800,,1805,4.5170278637770895
1634043,5,B00005NFYI,"+++++

This DVD presents two of the 55 minute Sherlock Holmes' episodes that had Jeremy Brett as Sherlock and David Burke as Dr. Watson.  Each episode is based on a story written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930) who wrote 56 short stories and 4 novels about Sherlock Holmes.

(1) ""The Crooked Man"" (13 scenes; based on the 1893 story).

A distinguished colonel is found dead in a room of his villa with his unconscious wife beside him.  Sherlock is asked to investigate.  His sleuthing leads him to a ""crooked man,"" who is ""an old acquaintance"" of the colonel's wife.  Be sure to see the fantastic acting by Norman Jones who plays the crooked man.

(2) ""The Speckled Band"" (10 scenes; based on the 1892 story).

A woman asks Sherlock to investigate the mysterious past death of her sister.  ""Holmes the meddler"" discovers that the woman's life may be in jeopardy.  The quotation by Sherlock that titles this review is found in this episode.

Brett (who made 41 Sherlock Holmes' dramas between 1984 and 1994) is in top-form in these two episodes since they were made before the time of his health problems.  He captures the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performances.

The costumes, background music, and cinematography are quite well done.  In my case, I found the picture quality and acoustic quality of this DVD to be practically perfect.

Finally, this DVD has 3 extras.  I found these interesting.  Newcomers to the series should especially enjoy them.

In conclusion, be sure to view this DVD and see why it won a 1988 Swedish Academy of Detection Award!!

(1983;  110 min;  British drama;  made for TV;  full screen)

1634044,3,B00005NFYI,"They'll let just about anybody write and produce a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and that has led to some very bad pastiches, films, and TV series.  I'm not saying The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1954-55) was a bad television series, but I'm certainly not saying it was a good one, either.  There is just something very wrong with filming Sherlock Holmes episodes in France, for one thing.  The real weakness of the show (at least insofar as I can tell from the three episodes collected here on this DVD), though, has to be the writing.  The three cases featured here are far from worthy of the Great Detective, and one of them in particular is the worst Sherlock Holmes mystery I have ever come across in any form.  Ronald Howard (the son of Leslie Howard, by the way) isn't all that bad in the role, but Howard Marion Crawford's Dr. Watson seemed a little too befuddled (and grouchy) for my liking.  It is important to note, however, that The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is, as far as I know, the only truly American Holmes series ever produced.  That may explain why too much time is wasted on attempts at humor rather than the construction of strong plots.

The Case of the Pennsylvania Gun does at least have a few hallmarks of a good Holmesian story - a dead body inside a moat-encircled, all but impregnable, island fortress.  Since it would be all but impossible for anyone to get in to the place at the time of the murder, Inspector McCloud assumes that one of the two other people in the castle at the time must be the murderer.  Holmes is even less than forthcoming than usual, infuriating Watson and the Inspector by going fishing in the moat.  Naturally, there is much more to this murder mystery than Scotland Yard can see.

The third episode is The Case of the Belligerent Ghost, and it is the most entertaining entry on the DVD.  Watson encounters a heart attack victim on the street, helps him home, but can do nothing to prevent his death.  A short while later, the ""ghost"" of the dead man turns up and punches him in the eye.  As you might expect, Watson is completely flummoxed by the whole situation, especially when he meets the ghost again the next night and suffers a nose-tweaking from him.  There is no doubt that the man Watson assisted did die, but Holmes noses out a scheme of art theft behind all of the shenanigans.  The kicker comes in the episode's final revelation, which I have to say is extremely funny.

I skipped the second episode, The Case of the Texas Cowgirl, for a reason - would that I had skipped the episode itself when viewing this DVD.  This episode is absolutely horrible.  A young American rodeo lass from Texas finds a man killed with her tomahawk in her hotel room, seeks the help of Holmes (whom she continually addresses as ""Sherlock""), and subjects us to all sorts of Western stereotypes and embarrassingly bad action (the ""fun"" is just starting when she lassoes poor Watson in the study).  There is absolutely nothing good I can say about this episode.

In the final summation, this DVD just barely manages to earn three stars from me.  Just keep in mind that this is far removed from the true Sherlock Holmes, and producer Sheldon Reynolds is no Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  It's not very hard to see why the series only lasted through 39 episodes.",1116633600,,3309,4.569491525423729
1634045,5,B00005NFYI,"Volume 2 of MPI's great series of mysteries from Granada TV/PBS is as enjoyable as its predecessor.  In ""The Crooked Man"", a distinguished army colonel is found dead, and his unconscious wife is the primary suspect.  His regiment is unaware of the colonel's treachery in his younger days and that a man he left for dead due to it is back for revenge.  But is the man with the crooked back guilty?  In ""The Speckled Band"" the stepdaughter of a renowned but cruel doctor is about to be married and escape her unhappy home fears for her life when history repeats itself and the events that lead to her sister's death occur again.  Jeremy Brett and David Burke as Holmes and Watson are on the case!",1018483200,,694,4.476190476190476
1634046,5,B00005NFYI,"This, the second volume of the adventures of Sherlock Holmes the television series, is a welcome addition to the shelves of DVD sellers.
As the number of television shows increases at very high rates it is comforting to know that shows such as this as preserved for posterity on DVD.
AS the number of DVDs increases now that DVD player ownership has expanded to cover over 25% of US households and the number is poised to double by the end of the 2002 holiday season, the range of quality and reproduction of DVDs is also growing.
This does mean that less profitable ventures such as the Sherlock Holmes series seem doomed to limited treatments during transfer rather than get the full scale upgrading purists would prefer. For myself I would certainly prefer more but I am happy to be able to own these DVDs and watch them repeatedly.
Jeremy Brett, throught his years of portraying Holmes certainly carved out his reputation as being the ultimate Holmes. In these two early episodes one sees the stirrings of a determination by the actor to make the character his own.
There are so many aspects to these shows that it is difficult to know where to start. One of the reasons why the show developed it's avid following in my view is the attention paid to the original stories not only in the detail of portrayal but in observing the spirit of them. David Burke does excellent service in portraying Watson as an intelligent though somewhat limited colleague and pupil of the genius master and an individual in his own right who tries not to be overshadowed. This is a welcome rebuttal to the image of Watson as the buffoon who graced our screens for many years.
The two stories contained in this volume, Crooked Man and Speckled Band are both concerned with familial killings. In the first a husband's betrayal of his wife's true love many years ago results in his death and in the second a stepfather's greed for a legacy turns to murder. Both solid stories their depiction in 55 minute episodes highlights the superb editing skills used to bring them to the screen. Unlike many other period dramas the Homes series cuts across English class barrier lines while at the same time highlights the clear division between and within those classes.
All in all a little treasure which leads the viewer waiting on the edge of their seat for the next volume to arrive.",1017878400,,2358,4.68433734939759
1634047,5,B00005NFYI,Jeremy Brett is superb has Holmes. I think even Basil Rathbone would have to admit this (if he were still with us). The Crooked Man is a little slow with not must mystery but the acting is excellent. The Speckled Band is true to form.

1634048,4,B00005NFYI,"This TV serie is terrific. This is the ultimate Sherlock Holmes adaptation. Lush sets, perfect acting... Jeremy Brett will make you forgot all the previous Holmes actors.
Unfortunately the DVD edition is far from to be of the same quality. In Volume 2 most of the problem of picture & sound of Vol1 are solved. But we still miss any making-off or commmentary.",1008374400,,359,4.714285714285714
1634049,5,B00005NFYI,"I remember fondly watching this series when it was aired on PBS some years ago.  The quality of the production as well as the stories made me go and read all the Sherlock Holmes stories.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the episodes were faithful to the stories.  Even the original illustrations from the Strand magazine (where the Sherlock Holmes stories first appeared) were apparently used in setting up scenes in the episodes.  Since getting volumes 1 and 2 and eagerly awaiting volume 3, I've fallen in love with these excellent adaptations all over again.  They get better with repeat viewings.  You pick out little details you missed the first time.  I recommend these to anyone who appreciates good mysteries first of all, and those who appreciate dramatizations that are faithful to the author's vision of the story and characters.",1005696000,,848,4.971631205673759

1634051,4,B00005NFYI,"Brett was the definitive Holmes, in my opinion, and the DVDs of his performances are essential to all Holmes fans. That said, these DVDs are lacking in any sort of special features and -- worst of all -- while there were four episodes included on the first volume, there are only two on the second volume - at virtually the same price as volume one. Booooooooo! Hiss!",1005264000,,367,4.492537313432836
1634052,4,B00005NFYI,"If you read my review of the first edition of this DVD series, you would know I consider Jeremy Brett's Holmes to be superior to all other interpretations. If you didn't, now you do! After reviewing the DVD I read a review which itemized several technical flaws which I have since noted myself. This disc is no exception, as it includes one quite obvious flaw wherein Brett's face seems to spasm or jiggle unintentionally.
  Lord knows why this series hasn't garnered more attention, but if it had I can guarantee a bit more money and time would have been spent on the DVD's. The content is the most critical element (especially since there are NO special features save a few biographical screens) and again, it never fails to entertain.
  The Crooked Man is a rather heart-wrenching episode, showing the cruel machinations of an ambitious soldier and their deadly consequences. Although many episodes of this program are quite funny thanks to Brett's intensely mannered performance, this one relied on emotional content and dramatic irony to keep the viewer engaged. The Speckled Band was the first episode I was lucky enough to see when my mother introduced me to the series, and it too tells a striking and tragic story.

  Both episodes are generally humorless but continued the tradition of simple, loyal reproduction of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales. Brett is always fantastic and will be missed. (If you are like me, and you usually find something Holmes does or says very funny in each episode, listen for the British military jargon in The Crooked Man. It sounds as strange and silly to me as US army terminology must sound to them.)",1002758400,,1643,4.8464285714285715
1634053,3,B00005NFYI,Though a little better in quality than the first volume in this series it still lackes the beautiful sounds and film that you'd expect from a DVD. Once more the same things i said in my review for the 1st volume apply.,1002672000,,218,4.214285714285714
1634054,5,B00005NFYI,"Being a big fan of British television in general, the fact that I had never seen an episode of this series was remedied when I purchased the first disc. The four episodes on it made their way onto my screen in less than 2 days so enthralled was I in the acting and production values.  The second disc, although it has only two episodes, is still highly recommended. The first episode, The Crooked Man, features Norman Jones (who Doctor Who fans will recognize for his role in The Masque of Mandragora) as a soldier wronged in the past in Afghanistan by his superior officer. Amazing how I watched this episode while news of impending conflict with that same nation appeared immenant.  The second episode, The Speckled Band, held my interest more, if only for the wonderful location filming in one of those large houses of which there seem to be so many in the UK. Jeremy Kemp's wild-looking doctor had me enthralled. Calling Holmes an interfering busy-body, indeed! Jeremy Brett simply shines as Sherlock Holmes, always giving the impression that he knows far more than us mere mortals, including an almost constantly bemused David Burke as Dr. Watson.  Here's to the next release! Hopefully MPI will eventually release them all...",1000944000,,1231,4.852380952380952
1634055,3,B00005NFYI,"As a big fan of Sherlock Holmes, and Jeremy Brett I was delighted to see the release of the first series on DVD by MPI.The overall quality of the DVD's has been good, the standard of the picture is high, and the sound quality is acceptable. The second DVD in the series is an improvement on the first, however the quality of the sound could be improved, as bad lip synchronization is distracting, particularly in the Speckled band. I have already placed an order for the 3 vol in the series, and I look forward to the future release of the second series.",999993600,,554,4.388349514563107
1634056,3,B00005NFYI,"Volume two contains THE CROOKED MAN and THE SPECKLED BAND, two of the very best adaptations in the series.
The quality of transfer from 16mm on this DVD is superior to the first volume (although still slightly grainy), but there are some problems.
THE CROOKED MAN does have some image stability problems, which causes the image to jump very slightly up and down at times (and actually roll on one of my DVD players). There is also a slight greenish tint to the fist few minutes of the episode. THE SPECKLED BAND also has some image stability problems, especially in chapter five (the train sequence) where the right side of the screen shifts slightly, causing the image to ""float"". There are also sound synchronicity issues in both episodes, very brief, but noticeable nonetheless. Both episodes do have lint (at the top of the frames), scratches and holes intermittently, which could have been cleaned up digitally. The sound is good throughout the DVD--none of the warbling that marred the first DVD in the series occurs here.
Jeremy Brett and David Burke are at their best in well-scripted adaptations of the original stories. The supporting players are wonderful as well.
There are also a photo gallery, biographies and filmographies, and a list of Sherlockian and Jeremy Brett Societies.
In all, a much better quality DVD than Volume One, and, despite the problems, I'd recommend this DVD, especially if your VHS tapes have started to degrade. One hopes that the quality will continue to improve, and I eagerly await the next volume.",999043200,,1538,4.942084942084942

Later Mr. Hope finds the letter in his dispatch box! How did this happen? We too have our diplomatic secrets says Holmes. [Was this Doyles comment on the personal lives of the aristocracy?]
