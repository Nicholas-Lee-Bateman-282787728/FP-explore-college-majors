2654091,3,B000I931E0,"Plot is pretty obvious, but ending is sort of unexpected.  Acting is ho-hum.  Horrific sound track.",1414108800,,99,5.125

2654093,1,B000I931E0,"This is 100% pure schlock. 80's B roll film impersonation of a police drama with the cop couple after the bad guy. Bad story, bad acting, worse costumes, thoroughly depressing locations, and directed by Tony Lobianco who should have stuck to playing mobsters. Don't waste your time. Watch ""The 7 Ups"" instead.",1400025600,,309,4.961538461538462
2654094,2,B000I931E0,If you lived/watched TV in the 1970s - you will recognize this.  It seemed like an episode of an old detective story.  Gotta love Mike Connors,1394409600,,142,4.423076923076923
2654095,2,B000I931E0,"The picture was subpar, with the letterboxing non-amorphic so everyone looked short and fat.  I know....expecting WAY too much out of an old 80s B movie.",1386979200,,153,4.884615384615385
2654096,3,B000I931E0,"Fairly obscure sorta slasher movie from the early 1980's starring Mike Connors (Mannix) as a very old looking police detective investigating a series of murders in an apartment building, assisted by a female undercover cop who appears to both report to him and be his girlfriend played by Anne Archer.  The chief suspect in the murders is an effete doorman played by the great Ian McShane, who makes the most of his scenes but should have been given a lot more screen time.  Any self-respecting fans of 80's slasher pics will know that McShane is a red herring straight off--the killer is never anyone that obvious in these films, but even if you figure out who the real killer is (I did) you aren't likely to figure out the extra twist that the movie throws in for good measure.  The violence in Too Scared To Scream is a bit too tame to qualify this as a real slasher movie even though all of the other elements are there but if you are in the mood for some 80's camp this is reasonably entertaining.",1368403200,2,1002,4.46448087431694
2654097,5,B000I931E0,"Does anyone know of a dvd release of this movie in NTSC, All region or region 1 format? Please let me know!",1348617600,,107,3.909090909090909
2654098,5,B000I931E0,"I watched this movie some years ago and found it interesting.  The story is about tenants murdered in one of New York's high rise buildings.  Mike Connors and Ann Archer were great together.  They play the detectives trying to solve the murders.  I thought they were a great looking couple with great chemistry between them.

The best part of this film is at the beginning with Charles Aznavour singing the title song, ""I'll Be There.""  This song is one of my favorites, and it is hard to choose a favorite song from Charlie.",1214524800,7,525,4.591397849462366

2654100,5,B000I931E0,Kept you on the edge of your seat until the end!,1440633600,,48,3.4545454545454546
2654101,4,B000I931E0,"Not terrible but not great. At times it feels like a made-for-tv movie but then they throw in nudity and cursing and you know it's not. Ian McShane is wonderful, and I wish he had more screen time. Mike Connors and Anne Archer are good but their acting rarely elevates it above that made-for-tv genre and I'm still not sure why Maureen O'Sullivan bothered to participate. What I did love were the NYC street scenes - NYC before it became so sanitized! When it was still edgy and gritty. I will say I did enjoy the storyline and I thought I had it figured out - but to my surprise I didn't. When they finally did reveal the killer I was quite surprised as I had thought for sure it was someone else. Of course, there are the usual red herrings, but they do keep up the suspense. For that I would give it 4 stars. I'd definitely give it a watch when there's nothing else on ... it's not that bad.",1437609600,2,894,4.203488372093023
2654102,4,B000I931E0,Great movie,1431820800,,11,5.0
2654103,4,B000I931E0,It's real old fashioned movie that has you guessing right up to the end with several red herrings thrown. Loved it,1429315200,,114,4.476190476190476
2654104,4,B000I931E0,"Not the highest quality film, looks like a made-for-TV movie or a pilot that was never picked up. Ian McShane is brilliant.  Its a slasher film with an actual plot.  I was so sure I knew who the killer was, (I was wrong), although my husband figured it out (as always) and interesting plot twist at the end.  Its a fun movie for entertainment.",1426032000,2,343,4.328125
2654105,3,B000I931E0,Pretty good movie. It kept my interest.,1424649600,,39,4.714285714285714
2654106,5,B000I931E0,"One of the best 'thrasher' films of the 80's but IT'S NOT! It's a really good cop action horror movie! Mike Connors [Mannix] plays a detective
with the gorgeous and talent Anne Archer looking HOT! and the great Ian McShane giving a great performance as the suspect who works
at the building where people are being murdered and takes care of his sick mother! Very well written directed and acted by all and a rare
movie from the 80's was more than just a slasher film. too bad it's not on dvd! but my vhs plays good enough to watch 100's more times!",1422144000,,548,4.330097087378641
2654107,5,B000I931E0,"OMG - I've been watching this film for about 30 minutes, and it had me from the opening sequence.  What's not to love when it's Ian McShane, slowly and seductively applying black eyeliner pencil while gazing rapturously at his reflection in a mirror?  And the next sequence, when a guy in a black limo cracks a herpes joke to his female companion, who doesn't find it amusing?  This thing has legs.  Mike Connors is great, McShane is dynamite (he always has been) and still young enough to have those fantastic good looks that made him such a hit in Masterpiece Theatre's production of 'Disraeli' decades ago.  Really amazing liberal use of nudity, sexual perversion, poetry-quoting, and the capture of the era's cultural superficiality.  Really takes me back to my early teens.  Decent script, great characters, strong performances...what more could you want?  Title quote for review taken directly from a scene featuring ""Vincent"" the doorman (McShane) in a dive bar.",1418860800,,969,5.050314465408805
2654108,1,B000I931E0,Campy and worth it if you want to remember the 80's.  Otherwise not worth the time.,1418688000,,83,4.1875

8144514,3,B000I931E0,"I said this is ""OK""  but will be honest, I did not finish watching it... I kept waiting for the pieces to fit and the story to move

8144519,3,B000I931E0,"I watched the whole thing, so that's something, at least. I like these dated,
illogical thrillers.

Anne Archer is at the house of a suspected killer. Does she have a gun ? No.
And she's a cop. Yeah, okay.",1464739200,,205,4.256410256410256
