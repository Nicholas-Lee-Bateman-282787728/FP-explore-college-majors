5681072,5,B00BXTH44C,I really enjoyed watching this DVD of Queen Victoria's 9 - COUNT EM' 9 Children! It was interesting to find out the dirt behind the crown. Who knew that Victoria had a voracious appetite - not just blood or figgy pudding guys ;) or that she was a near tyrant in controlling her children's lives. If any of you are interested in history and all sorts of tidbits - I'd recommend you pick this up. Its about 180 mins and broken down into 3 sections; but worth every minute and penny. I love history so if you do too - this one is for you. :),1390003200,52,538,4.084905660377358
5681073,5,B00BXTH44C,This video presented a little known glimpse Into the lives of Victoria's royal children--quite surprising and extremely interesting!  A worthwhile purchase.,1379808000,14,156,6.428571428571429

5681075,5,B00BXTH44C,I have been fascinated with Queen Victoria since I was a little boy.  I never knew how many children there were ... and was pleased to have been so well informed.,1376352000,3,162,4.225806451612903

5681077,3,B00BXTH44C,thought it could have had more in-depth info on each child.  info on the boys was very sketchy.not enough on edward who was next in line for the throne.,1373587200,6,152,4.241379310344827
5681078,4,B00BXTH44C,"I always wondered about the children of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.  The nine children, born over a period of seventeen
years,could be best described as victims.  The more well known were Bertie the heir to the throne who became King Edward VII
after the death of Queen Victoria and the oldest daughter Victoria who was the unfortunate mother of Kaiser Willhem who
was responsible for WWI.  This documentary by historians of Queen Victoria and her children, five daughter and four sons,
presents  a horror story of physical and emotional abuse that is shocking.  It is sad that Prince Albert died for many reasons but
especially that he was not there to protect their children from the Queen. The five daughters are praiseworthy for the fact
that they overcame the abuse  that Victoria heaped on them and became independent personalties.  This account of the
relations between Victoria and her nine children should be called Women who should never be mothers.",1373587200,73,965,4.99375

5681091,4,B00BXTH44C,"I've read much about Victoria but most of it was cut and dried history without an attempt at her personality.  What a nightmare of a mother!  That her children survived her and, to a lesser degree, their father is a triumph of the human spirit.  In this age they'd probably all be in rehabs for drugs and alcohol or suicides.  Even though both Victoria and Albert had less than ideal childhoods, the misery they inflicted on their children was inexcusable.
This was a well done and interesting program.",1471478400,3,502,4.670454545454546

5681097,4,B00BXTH44C,"Parenting in that age is not like parenting in our time, plus royalty is a wholly different world, so  it doesn't seem fair to overly judge Victoria's parenting skills.  She didn't grow up with good parenting herself, so it's not hard to see how she might have been challenged in that regard.
  What was especially interesting in this film was adding this information to the picture of the era leading up to WWI...which of course leads to WWII, etc.  The lives and marriages of Victoria's children had a tremendous impact upon our world.  I'd love to read all of the history books and biographies for this era.  Since I don't have enough time, I find documentaries like this help me focus in on the ones I most want to explore.",1451692800,2,727,4.546153846153846
5681098,3,B00BXTH44C,"Very interesting tidbits, especially Queen Victoria's deep physical obsession for her beloved Prince Albert and how German was the daily language of discourse for the family.  I have viewed better documentaries on British royalty, however, and believe that is one rates more a 2 1/2 star - but since that wasn't available, I had to give it 3.  Ok, but omit from your collection.",1447804800,,378,4.890625

5681103,1,B00BXTH44C,"Queen Victoria's Children is the poorest documentary I have ever seen about British History. The same facts were given over and over, there
were few actual photos of the family, no bibliography of any members of her children was given. I expected details, photos, facts regarding
the children's lives, whom they married, and was ready to view a historical, exciting account of the Queen's children.

None of my expectations were met. I viewed this DVD one time. It will be donated to charity.",1440633600,2,492,4.927710843373494

I thought it would follow her children a bit more into their adulthood/marriages but , although it touched on them it was mainly about Victoria and her reactions to her children.  WOW! Talk about ""needy""!
 Its too bad her children felt that it was their duty to give their lives over to her needs, which by the way, were never met by anyone. Just goes to show you that one should never put too much into what people display as their real lives.  No one really knows what goes on behind closed doors.",1434499200,,576,4.40566037735849

5681128,4,B00BXTH44C,"Sad story of parental abuse that probably contributed to the intrafamily rivalries that started World War I.
Also told about the high incidence of hemophilia in Queen Victoria's children and grandchildren. One of her four sons was afflicted and three of her five daughters carried the trait. One daughter passed the hemophilia trait to the Czarovich of Russia. This is what you'd expect in an X linked trait, but sad to see the theory demonstrated.
Despite the turmoil of their childhood, Victoria's eldest son became a good king, and her daughters worked hard for women's rights.",1425340800,,580,5.052083333333333

5681132,4,B00BXTH44C,Yes I have watched this DVD and I must say I was not surprised that she loved sex but hated Babies. I am so glad I was not one of her poor children. They were both so harsh on their Kids. AS for Prince Albert he was harsh on his Bertie too. Bertie well he had a wow of a time in his life and why not.!!! His Mother was always harsh not allowing him preparation for the time he would become King which happened in 1901. He reigned for 9 years. It turned out he was a natural diplomat the opposite of his cold Mother. I am interested in the History of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha later to become the House of Windsor by King George V whilst WW1 was active. The name was changed because the Royals were concerned about a back lash against a very German Monarchy including Queen Mary who has been depicted in history as a ICE QUEEN.. They George V even denied the CZAR Nicholas & his family sanction even though PM David Lloyd George was happy to give them protection. We all know the story in 1918 the entire Czar and his family and servants were all executed by the new incoming Red Russians. Well would you like to have that on your conscience. It was blamed on the Govt. until the truth was revealed some time ago now. The current Queen gets her looks from Queen Mary that is obvious to see from DVDS and Photos. This is not a surprise as I have read a book about the Princess who never married to devote her life to Queen Victoria at her insistence of course so a lot was covered on all her children.,1419724800,,1504,4.154109589041096
5681133,5,B00BXTH44C,"I was very impressed with this documentary.  It presented quite a bit of material which was new to me.  I don't think I appreciated the degree to which Queen Victoria was a 'Mommy Dearest'.  This documentary works very effectively in conjunction with 'Royal Cousins at War', this offering covering Queen Victoria's children, the other her grandchildren.  With the centennial of World War One upon us, these two films offer valuable insight into the personalities and politics which determined the age.  Note:  They ARE documentaries, not films designed purely for entertainment, though that does by no means diminish their value.",1419292800,14,629,5.303030303030303

5681135,4,B00BXTH44C,Found it very interesting but had no idea how controlling she was with her family. And hated babies but had nine? Not by her choice but that's how it was in those days.

5681137,4,B00BXTH44C,Queen Victoria's Children was interesting and enjoyable...maybe too many flashbacks to the families footwear as other reviewers mentioned.  For those who have an interest in British Royals and history it would be worth watching. I liked it!,1415318400,2,240,5.486486486486487

5681149,5,B00BXTH44C,This was a well done three-part documentary on the children of Queen Victoria.  She was a difficult woman and none of them had a good childhood.

5681155,2,B00BXTH44C,"The snarky commentary in this ""documentary"" takes the unfortunate viewpoint of judging historical persons and incidents by today's ""standards."" If you equate the Victorian age with family values, modesty, and wisdom, you will see your understanding twisted and forced into a mold forged by today's warped view of family, children's ""rights,"" and wimpy humanism.

8575168,2,B00BXTH44C,"I was expecting something different, perhaps more entertaining.  The account presented here is a series of expose's detailing everything negative or critical about the family.  Victoria herself is demonized as an egotistical, selfish and uncaring mother as well as something of a nymphomaniac!  They even go so far to say that her breasts were essentially a sexual organ!  Bits and pieces of evidence, including snatches from the couples letters, are selectively introduced to buttress this narrative, along with negative interpretations of events by the commentators.  Every little fault of any member of the royal family is revealed in salacious detail -- every problem, disability, quirk or foible is covered.  One gets the impression that this is probably the worst family on earth.  This is over-the-top tabloid journalism on film and a disappointment to me.

This is a straight documentary, albeit a flawed one in my opinion.  The production is mostly stills combined with chatty, gossiping commentary by a number of people.  The movie runs slowly, is not at all entertaining and toward the end you wind up feeling a bit depressed about why someone would do such a film.  Money is one reason, of course, and career advancement is another.",1493251200,,1244,5.17
