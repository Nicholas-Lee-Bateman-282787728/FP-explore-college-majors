7844874,2,6303332447,"This movie was a birthday tradition from age 8-15 and a source of unknown (to all those around me) tag lines. Excessively repeated plot line, bad audio dubbing, terrible special effects, and a bunch of crossbow-launched explosives make this movie enjoyable at a different level than most cheesy films. If you enjoyed Six String Samurai, you'll love this flick for it's cheese factor alone. Miles O'Keefe's stoic hero keeps this story going with outnumbered victories, terrific one-liners, and a little tai-chi-in-the-sunset-with-no-shirt, just for sex appeal. The heroine's unfaltering ability to come into harm's way keeps the Lone Runner guessing in this D-movie (for desert) classic.",1245542400,,686,5.542857142857143
7844875,2,6303332447,"The basic storyline behind this movie is simple girl gets in trouble,  Miles O'keefe saves girl. This is done over and over again until it numbs  the mind and dulls the senses.",968284800,,176,4.46875
