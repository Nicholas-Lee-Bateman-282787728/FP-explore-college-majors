723663,4,6303912737,"not bad not good, but quite a workout. it really burns your muscles and i think i'm starting to see some muscles build.",991094400,,119,4.217391304347826
723664,5,6303912737,"This is the first exercise video where I haven't been able to complete all the repitions of moves- my legs were simply not strong enough to keep up with Claudia which gave me a goal to work towards. Because it is such a challenge it definetly will reshape your legs and it seems to me it elongated my legs as well  (may be that's Claudia's secret) There is standing and floor work in this workout and with consistency you will be hearing ""Nice Legs!"" from hot guys!",980899200,7,465,4.344827586206897
723665,5,6303912737,"I bought this video in 1996 because of the rave reviews I read in various fitness magazines.  It was an incredible winter work-out, and by that summer I wasn't embarrassed to remove my towel to get in the pool.  Two moves (and 25 pounds!) ... I am so exicted to be able to do these exercises again, and I want you to know that this tape is fabulous.  Trust me, as a woman who spends most of her time sitting at a desk I am really looking forward to getting back into this routine.  I know I will be seeing results in a few short weeks!",979516800,4,535,4.018867924528302
723776,5,6303912737,"I love reviews becuase it is real people talking about their experiences and I find them very helpful.  Over the winter I put on a few pounds, especially in the hip and thigh area.  I tried everything and got very frustrated.  I started this tape and saw great results in only 2 weeks.  My jeans started to hang on me and I felt great.  It is easy to follow, not boring, and you have no annoying person trying to motivate you.  Some of the reviews say Claudia looks awkward in some of the moves.  I agree, but believe it is because she is tall, with long legs.  I love the location and music.  Try this one and I don't think you will be dissappointed.",1118102400,9,651,4.185483870967742
723777,5,6303912737,"This series of tapes is great.  I wish they would put all 4 tapes (arms, legs, buns, abs) onto one dvd.  For the arm tape, I only use 3lb. weights, but you work them to exhaustion.  You don't need a lot of space or a lot of equipmant to do any of the tapes (a mat, a chair, and one set of weights is all you need for any of the tapes).  The leg video can even get your heart rate up.  I started using these tapes when I was in college and I still pull them out 8 years later!",1107216000,11,475,3.6633663366336635
723778,5,6303912737,"I have all four Claudia Schiffer videos, but I found this one the most intense for me because of the intensive outer thigh and hip portion of the video. For that portion, all the outer legs exercises are done before switching to the other side, which fatigues your muscles more than if you kept switching back and forth. The only problem I have is that the inner thigh exercise wasn't intense enough for me, but I would still give this 5 stars.

I wish these videos could be released on DVD. These videos are really the only reasons why I still own a VCR.",1104192000,12,555,4.336538461538462
723779,5,6303912737,I thought this was a Great leg work-out. I use to work in a gym and we use to tell our members to work each leg until it hurt (No pain No gain)as they say. Well it works each leg very hard and you feel the burn and feel great when your done. For anyone who thinks it's too hard to do you need to just stick with it and you will build up the strength in your legs and it will get easier. Stick with it. But order them all from Amazon you get them much faster then anyone else. I ordered Legs and Arms on a Wednesday and recieved them on the following Monday. I am still waiting on my Abs that I ordered from a different source. Amazon is the BEST and Quickest. Thanks,1054598400,8,666,3.8686131386861313
723780,2,6303912737,"The exercises in this video would be effective if done properly. Although Kathy Kaehler (Schiffer's trainer) demonstrates the proper form, Schiffer doesn't follow through when she's exercising. She seems very awkward and not into the moves at all. This workout may be good for a beginner, but for anyone at an intermediate or advanced level, it wouldn't be worth the purchase.",1054252800,,376,5.180327868852459
723781,5,6303912737,"I like the video because it is short, effective, and not too boring.  I have yet to tire of the video and feel that it is not too stressful on the joints etc (although I only recommend one repetition of the video for beginners - I was very sore after 2 reps).  I also like the way the video is focused on one part of the body - the legs.
It doesn't take a long time to do the video and I think it is definitely one of the best on the market.",1043193600,3,441,3.7311827956989245
723782,3,6303912737,"I bought this tape and the buns tape in early 2000 when I was teaching aerobics.  Overall, I am pleased with the workout, but my biggest complaint is the cooldown/stretch at the end.  She does just a couple minutes of stretching after an intense toning workout.  The first time I did this tape, I did her cooldown and stretching only.  The next day, I was so sore I could hardly walk.  Since then, I add my own 10-minute stretching session after the video and feel great.
As other reviewers have also said, this workout targets muscles you don't usually work.  You see results very fast and build strong muscles.  I think it's great that she has her personal trainer there to help demonstrate correct form so you don't damage your muscles.  The exercises can be pretty difficult since you aren't used to them, but man do they work!  Expect some shape after only a few sessions.  You will feel better and stronger after each time you do the video.
I don't exactly like the music, but it is relaxing.  Claudia doesn't keep rhythm so well, so it's a bit hard to stick with her if you choose to play your own music, as I do for a change in pace.  I agree with another reviewer that she does look too thin.
The exercises are great and you can do them just about anywhere.  I recommend this video as long as you stretch a lot once you are through with it.  A lot of the exercises are repeated in the buns video.  Both are worthwhile and not that expensive so it's not bad having both.  But they both begin the same way.  I would actually recommend rotating videos so you get a wide-range workout.
PS. Don't do this video in front of a mirror or anyone else unless you have Claudia Schiffer thighs---gravity is not very kind in these exercises!",1025568000,3,1737,4.394984326018808
723783,4,6303912737,"I really like this tape. About 30 minutes long, the tape starts with a warm-up, proceeds with the work out and finishes with stretches for the muscles that you just exercised. The main part of the work out cosists of about 5-6 different excersize series. Each of them is some variation of the old but proven lunges, squats, and leg lifts. What is really helpful for me is that while there are not any ""revolutionary"" new exerices, I am forced to do all the repetitions--something that I do not have the discipline to do by looking at a magazine or going to the gym.  And judging by the areas where I am sore after I do this series, the routine works out not only the legs but the but as well.
My only issue with the tape is that Claudia does not have the controlled movements we are led to believe are safest and most effective.",1015372800,2,828,4.3076923076923075
723784,5,6303912737,this was a great beginer/intermediate workout. i have been doing this workout for about a year now and thanks to an improved diet and doing this tape 5 days a week i have lost 2 inches in my thighs and hips. I would say this is a great workout but after awhile i would add weights to make it challenging.,1011052800,4,304,4.083333333333333
723785,5,6303912737,"Having never done a supermodel workout video before, I was unsure of what to expect.  However, I felt comfortable right away- it was like working out with a good friend.  Claudia doesn't have the annoying cheerleader persona, but rather indirectly lets you know that she's feeling your pain!  And that puts you at ease right away.  In my opinion, the workout takes the best moves from all the other videos that I've tried and puts them together into one fluid routine.  After you've done a few sets you can literally feel your muscles tightening.  The results are that immediate, and are a great motivation to keep you coming back again and doing the video on a regular basis.  Most of the exercises focus on the outer thighs and hips.  The inner thigh workout is a bit skimpy but the intensity of the moves make up for it.  The music is fresh and soft and the scenery breathtaking.  If you purchase this video, I think you'll be glad that you did.",1003449600,8,948,4.523529411764706

7854597,5,6303912737,I love the entire series Claudia Schiffer has put together with trainer Cathy Kahler.,1417737600,,85,5.142857142857143

7854599,5,6303912737,A very good video especially when done back to back with Claudia's Perfectly Fit Buns. The mat exercises are the best-worst; you never get used to them but they're very effective.,1386201600,,179,4.806451612903226

7854601,5,6303912737,"I own three of these tapes, and they don't disappoint. I wish they were on DVD, but I still have a VCR in my gym. They're beautifully filmed with great music, and since they're presented in segments, you can do as many as you wish. The leg tape has a particularly killer segment that pays particular attention to the inner thigh. Great tape.",1241395200,,341,4.428571428571429
7854602,5,6303912737,"I finished doing this video for the first time exactly one minute ago, so I can't testify yet for long-term results. However, I have to say that I found it amazing. I have knee problems, and I liked to see that Kathy Kaehler not only made sure that each exercise (especially lunges, squats, hamstring stretches) was done in a way safe for the knees, but she repeatedly reminded me of the proper ankle-knee alignment.

I love floor leg work, and this is the most intensive I've ever experienced. It might not be as good for flexibility as Pilates, but it's also not jerky or bouncy -- just a steady variety of leg lifts that get your thighs and [...] burning in no time. (Yes, I was also frustrated with Claudia for not feeling the pain the way I was. Then again, she probably feels that pain every day.) Even the inner thigh lifts, if you really try to lift your leg high, produce an immediate effect.

The video is odd because you hear mostly Kaehler's lower, softer voice giving instructions, counts, and tips, with a few of the main instructions and encouragements from Schiffer. I kind of liked it though.",1165968000,,1109,4.54
7854603,5,6303912737,"I have owned this tape for 10 years - bought it from a Newport News catalogfor $10 at the time. MAN do I wish I had been doing it for the past 10 years!! Now 38, I am really feeling the ""approaching 40"" expansion of my hips & thighs; and was devastated when I measured and found that my THIGHS were the size my WAIST was when I was 23. Boy does that suck.

So, I dragged this tape out with not very high expectations. I have been doing it roughly twice a week for about a month and a half. Lo & behold I have taken about an inch off of my hips & thighs, and my calves are quickly retoning themselves. I have much more energy as a result.

While following the tape, you may find yourself cursing out Ms Schiffer and Ms Kaehler (particularly when you realize neither of them are sweating, huffing or puffing one quarter the amount you are), but stick with it - you will not be sorry. I recently added the suggested ankle weights - completely worth the extra effort!

I really wish that all 4 of her workouts were on one DVD. I'd really like to give the others a try.",1148947200,6,1064,4.08133971291866
7854604,4,6303912737,"This workout burns the side thighs and hips very nicely! The rhythm of the counting was off way too frequently, and that was distracting, but I now just turn down the volume so I follow the visual and count on my own. Three sets of ten for most exercises, easy enough. Doing the hamstring lifts are so much more efficient with added ankle weights, as they suggest. And I am sorry the stretching is so brief. I pause the tape to do a deeper stretch while I'm heated up so I can keep my muscles long.

I do like the exercises in this program, and they are effective. Though the tape isn't perfect, the burn is worth my time.",1138752000,4,622,4.226890756302521
7854605,4,6303912737,"I am a big fan of this tape. The moves are simple but effective and you will feel the burn. Doing these exercises along with cardio will get you results. My previously chunky legs are so beautiful. There is no chatty instructor.  Kathy Kaehler, the trainer, will briefly show you how to do the exercises, and then you just hear counting, brief tips from Kathy and Claudia is shown in several different frames doing the exercise. The style of the video is kind of artsy, but nothing is too distracting not even the music.

 You start out with a brief warm-up with includes plies and a few standing lunges along with stretches. Then the first segment includes squats and lunges. You do 3 sets with 10 repetitions of each. I could stand for a few more reps of lunges, hence the four stars instead of five.

The next segment entails hamstring curls and calf raises. (You use a chair for balance and leg weights are optional. You will still feel the burn without them.) In total you actually do 6 sets of calf raises with, three sets are slow and the other three are pulsing with 15 reps each. You change the position of your feet with each set (toes pointed out, in and then neutral.) Then you do three sets of hamstring curls. To end this segment you stretch the muscles you just worked.

The final segment is done on the floor and you can use optional leg weights and a mat. You do leg lifts and kicks to work your inner and outer thighs. You alternate between a set of slow repetitions and pulses for 3 sets each. This segment really burns. Ouch! But your legs will look so nice. You finish with a nice soothing stretch.

Overall this is very effective workout which I highly recommend! :)",1138665600,12,1688,4.429032258064516
