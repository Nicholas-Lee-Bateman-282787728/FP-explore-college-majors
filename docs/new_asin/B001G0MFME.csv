3590680,5,B001G0MFME,"I have loved the Numb3rs programs since it started on the air back in 2005 and have every one of the seasons on DVD. I never missed the show, and think it is one of the best on television these days. I sincerely hope it has a nice long run.
The mix of math,science and crime fighting is wonderful. The family and personal relationships are unique to tv procedurals without being sappy or overbearing. The on going growth of the relationship between the brothers has been strong without hampering the crime investigations.",1258588800,,521,4.673913043478261
3590681,5,B001G0MFME,"To say that I was pleased with Numb3rs Season 5 DVD is putting
it mildly.

It is by far the best collection of extras since maybe the
first season.  The bloopers are lots of fun and you'll enjoy
watching them over and over.  Thankfully the characters who
""bloop"" take it all in stride and never lose their sense of
humor.

The episode commentaries we all enjoy so much are on the DVD too and that's always a big plus for me when I buy a DVD.

I'm definitely glad I bought Numb3rs Season 5 and recommend
you give it to someone you love for Christmas.  All ages will enjoy it.

One reason I've always enjoyed Numb3rs is that the episodes
can be watched by all ages.  There's no profanity and that's a
rarity on television these days.",1258416000,,731,4.2846715328467155
3590682,5,B001G0MFME,"Numb3rs season 5 is fantastic, it has so much action and it keeps u guessing, i would give it 10 stars. it shocked me a fair bit with the story lines, i can't wait now for season 6!",1256601600,,181,3.789473684210526
3590683,5,B001G0MFME,Enjoying the season. Don't have cable. So this is how we view things. Much better with no commercials.,1256169600,,102,4.722222222222222
3590684,5,B001G0MFME,"I like this series: characters are good,development too,the problem is this program don't has captions o subtitles and my English is not the best,so sometimes I lost dialogues o words and the mean is not always clear,otherwise,I love it!!!",1249430400,5,239,5.153846153846154
3590685,5,B001G0MFME,"I've only seen 12:01 AM of the new season. But I got to say that I'm really anticipating this show. This show, though not a comedy, is one of the greats along with That 70's show seasons 1-7. I own all other seasons of numb3rs and if you've never seen them before definetly recommend you watch. Here are the episodes of season five.

#15 Guilt Trip-When Robin Brooks loses a case involving the murder of an informant, the team takes it very personally. Launching an investigation to get around double jeopardy, and bring justice down on an international arms dealer.

#17 First Law-When an AI kills the scientist who created her it opens a career door for Charlies, but first he and Amita must determine what happened, putting Amita's life in jeopardy.

#18 12:01 AM-Charlie is distracted from applying math to his first basketball-coaching job when a doctor claims to have evidence that clears a death-row inmate, leaving him and the team very little time to be sure real justice occurs.
(My favourite of the season. Especially the part with larry.)

#19 Animal rightes-Charlie takes a very personal interest when one of CalSci's professors is murdered during a raid by animal rights advocates, and once the murderer is found, Nikki's actions put the operation and civilians at risk.

#20 The Fifth Man-Charlie once again questions his involvement with the FBI when a miscalculation leaves Don in the hospital and his team searching for the reason behind atypical home invasion robberies.

3590688,5,B001G0MFME,"In this episode, stage magic and math shake hands and (sometimes) square off. A guest appearance by Penn Gillette was an extra bonus for me; I've always been a Penn & Teller fan. Charlie is in character as the bah-humbug member of the team; he takes almost as dim a view of magic as he does of psychics, but he does learn a little about the fun and beauty of a good trick.

The mystery begins when a stage magician disappears, but doesn't reappear on cue. Is it a publicity stunt? Is it a kidnapping? A murder? Watch and see!",1227312000,,525,4.25

3590880,5,B001G0MFME,I'm really enjoying this series.  The characters continue to develop depth and persona and each episode's plot is unique and entertaining.

3590881,5,B001G0MFME,A little far fetched...but it is fiction. Would not have watched the series on standard TV. With commercials would have lost interest. But was a good binge show.,1473120000,,161,4.785714285714286

3590981,4,B001G0MFME,"Fun to watch. Not realistic for those of us who know anything about math, but really do enjoy many of the examples or visualizations, while being entertained by the human dynamics. The chemistry between the actors was a key ingredient in making this series worthwhile to watch, although sometimes it seemed that the writers manhandled the characters to keep them from growing in a normal way. (Thankfully that changed in later seasons before I pulled the plug on it.)",1469577600,,467,4.924050632911392
3590982,5,B001G0MFME,"Numb3rs is by FAR the very best show I have ever watched.

It has all the good parts from Criminal Minds, CSI, NCIS, but this show is not only much more interesting, but it also very unique.
I love CSI & Criminal Minds, but after a while they become too repetitive, but this show is very different and brings fresh ideas, unique takes on solving crime.

Highly Recommended!!!",1469318400,,375,4.5
3590983,3,B001G0MFME,"good episodes.  Engrossing stories most of which seem realistic.  Sometimes story can be a bit unbelievable that FBI would conduct themselves the way the story depicts.  You can predict that they will come to every suspects place with engines roaring and sirens blaring....go figure.  Yelling FBI when they are a block away from a suspect...always results in a chase.  Characters are interesting and believable....Larry is a bit much.
Not so subtle messaging on social issues of today...green, nutrition, political correctness",1469318400,,526,5.525

3591087,5,B001G0MFME,"This TV show is one that has quickly become a favorite in our household. It is overall clean enough for the family to watch, has some occasional language but we can sit down as a family and watch most episodes. Rob Morrow does an excellent job playing the protective older brother who has issues of his own, often sheltering Charlie, his younger brother. Charlie, played by David Krumholtz, is the perfect mathematician. Sometimes bumbling in his explanations, wanting the rest of the team to understand his illustrations. I love the examples he gives as it brings the science stuff down to our level. And you can't forget the rest of the cast, Judd Hirsch, Alimi Ballard, Dylan Bruno, Peter MacNicol, Sophina Brown and Navi Rawat. They all play off each other perfectly! This is almost the end of the show, only one final season and I wish it had continued much longer. Miss this wonderful team!!",1465171200,2,897,4.756410256410256

The series has a great cast all the way down,  David Krumhlotz and Rob Morrow filling out two leading characters brilliantly.  Then there is the veteran and ever professional Judd Hirsch.  I don't think I've ever seen this man deliver a bad performance.  The rest of the regulars in the cast are at the top of their game too.

3591447,4,B001G0MFME,"This is an interesting series, but some of the math is far fetched.  At one point, a simple math error is made when 1% of 16 million is stated as 240000.  Oooops.

It is good to see science and math highlighted in programming, rather than the usual pablum.  However, the bias towards leftist issues is still apparent here and very irritating, since CO2 is plant food and we have more energy than we know what to do with, now.",1447804800,,425,4.341772151898734

It ended on a good note.",1446249600,,372,4.7384615384615385

3591536,5,B001G0MFME,"This is just a great show.  It works great on a number of levels, for anyone who like whodunnits, action without huge amounts of violence, drama with morality.  I consider this a ""nerds"" mystery with heart. I would think anyone who liked the old Columbo mysteries or Monk would also like this, although it does have more action and violence.  I saw the pilot initially, and was turned off - serial killer - a little too violent for me - but after that, it seemed to hit its stride.  I love the metaphysical mindset brought in by Dr. Larry, even though he's a bit of a whackjob.  Love the strong family relationships, and brothers working together finding their way even though they are so different, the searching for faith from a Jewish standpoint.  That's very different.  And there is action, just not over the top with bits of body parts squelching everywhere, like in CSI.  After 6 seasons they ended it, I guess it wasn't bloody enough for today's R-rated audience, but for a nerd like me I loved it.  Whenever I saw them talking about something I learned in physics, I was, ""Yes!"".  Is it real?  No.  But neither is House, or CSI.  (Those labs in CSI?  I mean, Mine were always like sick green or white tile, not filled with cool black and UV blue lights...)",1444176000,2,1265,4.491228070175438

3591980,5,B001G0MFME,"For more than five years, ""Numb3rs"" was a fixture on CBS on Friday nights.  Two brothers, FBI agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow) and his mathematician brother Charlie (David Krumholtz) joined forces to solve crimes in and around Los Angeles.  This DVD set contains the all 23 episodes of the fifth season of the series, originally broadcast from October 2008 to May 2009.

A few intriguing plotlines involving Don, Charlie, and their family were introduced this season, and Charlie again provided mathematical knowledge to the FBI to help Don and his team of agents solve crimes such as murder, blackmail, fraud, theft, marijuana farming, a train crash, a bombing, a hostage situation, home invasions, a bank robbery, and a kidnapping.  Pau Gasol and Henry Winkler made guest appearances in these episodes.

Some of the mathematical concepts broached over the course of this season included game theory, probability, artificial intelligence, and voice analysis.  Facebook exploded in popularity in 2009, and its algorithms got a mention in an episode during the season.  One episode was set in the nearby Channel Islands, and this season saw the series delve into the worlds of surfing, basketball, sneaker collecting, and animal rights extremism.

Special features on this DVD set include commentary on the making of the series and a celebration of ""Numb3rs"" reaching the coveted 100-episode milestone.

This season also had an especially dramatic finale.  There is some foul language in the show, but the violence necessary for a police drama like this one is not gratuitous in ""Numb3rs.""  The show features likable characters with great chemistry, and the writing for the show is superb.  The show's devotees likely didn't want to see the series end, but after this season there was still one great season left.",1420416000,,1808,5.175257731958763

By this season though Charlie was getting a good idea of how the REAL world and reality actually works outside the liberal secular progressive fantasy and  academia.

But the funny thing is, I understood much more now that I've embraced my creative side (fine art graduate degree)!  Honestly, I had never heard of Fibronacci or the Golden Ratio until I became an art student!  It tickled me PINK to hear them talk about these concepts AND apply them!!  Loved the entire series.  When I finished watching it, I had Numb3rs withdrawals!  I didn't watch the series when it ran because I promised I wouldn't get caught up in any more television shows that pushed the envelop.

And losing Larry (or have we?) was definitely a shocker.  There were other things that happened way at the end, but the last episode was again, enough to make me watch season 6, which is what I'm doing now.

3592207,5,B001G0MFME,"I have loved every season of Numb3rs so far.  It is easy to say that it's a crime drama at heart, but really it's so much more.  There is the math aspect, that brings a different way of looking at crime-solving.  It is done in such a way that doesn't feel like a math lesson; and I have every confidence that law enforcement makes use of such special consultants as they are available.  The internal conflict of each character, and the relationships between them all is really what makes the show, and makes the show great.  The different crimes just provide the backdrop to bring them all together.  David Krumholtz as Charlie is excellent, as ever, in his portrayal of a mathematical genius who can become completely absorbed in his academic endeavors, and yet has found a growing sense of satisfaction and purpose in his work consulting with his brother for the FBI.  Rob Morrow as Agent Don Eppes is believable, and his character goes through some changes in this particular season that seem to round him out more.  It's nice to see the series growing and branching out from some of the familiar patterns, and yet maintaining the crux of what made it such a successful show.  I have always had a soft spot for Judd Hirsch (who plays Alan, Don & Charlie's father) ever since I used to watch him in Taxi years ago, so I am happy to see his character become more prominent.  He really has a way of making his on-screen moments count.  Peter MacNicol (Professer Fleinhardt) and Navi Rawat (Amita Ramanujan) also perform brilliantly and add nice depth to the series, as well as the other characters.  I love that Amita's character is a strong, confident and intelligent young woman, and yet she still has struggles with dating and decision making as many young women do.  It feels real.  Not one-dimensional, as if she's got the whole world figured out, or is just completely clueless.  Fleinhardt is a great bridge character.  He fits both in the analytical, academic world, and at the same time he is equally invested in the spiritual side of things.  It is nice to see a character that straddles both sides of things, and does so believably.  He brings a bit of whimsy to the show, and portrays how one can be invested in academia and science but still have faith and spirituality at the same time.  It is nice for me particularly because I came to this series not expecting to like his character.  Not for any other reason than I had not liked other characters I'd seen MacNicol portray previously.  Alimi Ballard and Dylan Bruno as Agents David Sinclair and Colby Granger respectively have an easy time holding their own among this incredible cast.  Their relationship as partners has gone through some changes, had some ups and downs, over the seasons and it's nice to see it settle into stable ground even as the characters themselves deal with their own individual issues.  This season allows us to see a bit more of Sinclair, while the past has focused more on what is going on with Granger.  Aya Sumika as Liz Warner and Sophina Brown as Nikki Betancourt add a nice touch of hard femininity to the show.  They provide strong female characters that hold their own among this male dominated cast.  While some of the characters may have less screen time, it is hard to imagine the show without any of them.  They all do their part to add to the ""believabilty"" of the reality that is the show.  Not one character feels expendable, and they all feel like real people and not caricatures of a particular trait.  At this point in the series I am genuinely invested in each character, and knowing that there is only one more season gives me a small pang of sadness.  I hope that the actors all enjoyed making this show as much as I have enjoyed watching them in it.",1400112000,,3766,4.585949177877429
3592208,5,B001G0MFME,"This series has fresh material each episode with lots of action and suspense intermingled with science. I really appreciated the fact that Numb3rs does not find the need for foul language. The character interaction of the family and team members gives this series a depth and leads one to feel that one knows each person: the brothers, the father, the love interests.  Then there was the time when Megan resigned  she left a hole for the rest of the series. When Colby was in trouble  No, not Colby!  I could go on and on but that would not be good.

While a formula police/FBI procedural show, i find it to be entertaining enough to watch the entire series. Thus it gets 3.5 stars as being above average in terms of entertainment.

I particularly like to connection to real world concepts [math, physics, etc] to help solve complex issues. The writers do [did] and incredible job interweaving the particular math concepts and while the cutaways to illustrate the examples often got annoying [visuals], I think they did a great job showing that there are a lot of real world practical applications of complex mathematics. The only question I have is why we do not see this applied in more real world settings. My guess is that what is shown on this show [Charlie creating and running some algorithm] seems like it takes him a few hours and with no real obstacles [computers, manpower] actually would take a year with 100 people working on it.

3592433,4,B001G0MFME,"I suppose I've always been a fan of ""NUMB3RS"", but maybe not for the same reasons that some of my friends have.  I am not an expert on police (or FBI) procedure, but I do know excellent interaction with characters, and this show has that hands down.  Perhaps the most critical aspect of ""NUMB3RS"" is the family tie-in, with the incomparable Judd Hirsch anchoring that family.
  To say that the family of Professor Charles Epps (David Krumholtz) is not affected by the actions of the day would not be correct -- but that they are able to gain from the interaction of the police and math-science work.  Slowly revealing the backgrounds of the main  characters gives us a continual story-line full of small -- and sometimes large -- surprises.  That the brothers may have actually had typical sibling rivalries makes this all the more interesting, and brings out the best in Charlie's brother Don -- well filled out by Rob Morrow -- showing the stress of managing in the FBI environment.
  Characters come and go, but the one constant in how well they fit in with the whole complexity of plots and sub-plots.  The ""supporting"" actors are very important in a show that features such strong family ties, with Navi Rawat in a very demanding role as Charles' love interest/former student protege Amita Ramanjuan and Dylan Bruno (Agent Granger) plus Alimi Ballard (Agent Sinclair), along with the somewhat esoteric Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNichol) are a worthy entourage!
  The environment is in full view as well, as Charles' appetite for ""greening"" the family home is an ongoing project.  The ideas bring in some more interesting characters, and though they never seem to be a mainstay, their presence is welcome indeed...
  I would rate this series amongst the best on network television, mainly held up by the well written portrayals of a family in a constant state of flux regarding each of their individual life leanings.  If I could compare this series with another, it would be ""NCIS"", another program well watched for it's excellent character portrayals and character building -- where comings and goings are a natural state of affairs.
  I have to admit being a long-time fan of the brothers Scott (as well as that of Belasarius), mainly for their excellent directorial abilities.  I guess they knew a hot property when they saw one, and this is evidenced by the ""extras intro"" in which the creators are given a sort of last-ditch grasp at finding someone to produce their idea.  Thank goodness it was Tony and Ridley Scott!

3592462,5,B001G0MFME,"...describes the overall tone of Numb3rs, a unique attribute for a mature series.  Although the basic formula hasn't altered since Season 1--FBI Special Agent Don Eppes recruits his mathematical genius brother, Professor Charles Eppes, to help solve crime--the human element of the series has evolved as characters have developed and become more complex.  Season 5 featured several pivotal character events--Charlie's security clearance is restored, the process of which prompts a journey of self-examination for Don, a  journey which bravely includes an exploration of his Jewish faith (a facet to his character which helps set him apart from other TV cops); David receives a promotion to Don's second-in-command, which fleshes out the differences in professional approach between him and Don, and creates tension between him and partner Colby; Don suffers a near-fatal stab wound as a result, in part, of a miscalcuation of Charlie's, which leads Charlie to question his own purpose in life; and Amita is kidnapped, which ultimately deepens her romance with Charlie and prompts a season-ending marriage proposal.

The interpersonal relationships of the characters remain at the core of the storytelling, with character and plot each informing the other, particularly that of the Eppes family.  The continuing influence of executive producers Tony and Ridley Scott can be seen throughout this season, from the dramatic and visual intensity of episodes like ""Thirty-Six Hours"", in which the team races to save lives following the collision of two trains, and ""Jacked"", in which a tour bus is hijacked, leading the FBI team through a series of surprising plot twists which, even after repeated viewings, catches the audience by surprise, to the cinematic and romantic feel of ""Angels and Devils"".  The series continues to be enhanced by a great score and soundtrack as well.

To the writers' credit, Numb3rs doesn't need to resort to high-tech bells and whistles to tell a compelling story.  Lower-key episodes such as ""Frienemies"", ""Arrow of Time"", ""Chinatown"", and ""First Law"" provide insight into character and pose evocative philosophical questions, while ""Disturbed""--the series 100th episode--recalls the pilot episode and treats the show's loyal fanbase to a goody bag of trivia (including a Michael Rooker mention, a nod to the original unaired pilot in which Rooker played an FBI agent).  The supporting cast are given moments to shine, and even take a lead role, in episodes like ""Thirty Six Hours"", ""Cover Me"", and ""First Law"", underscoring the strength of the ensemble cast.  The quality of guest stars remains high, with names such as Lou Diamond Phillips, Keith Carradine, Henry Winkler, and Colin Hanks making recurring appearances (and it was fun for me to see a childhood favorite, Emergency's Kevin Tighe, in ""Charlie Don't Surf"").

The extras are the best since the Season 3 disc, and include the popular Crunching Numb3rs segment, the hysterical blooper reel, and footage of the 100 episode celebrations.  Also included are deleted scenes from ""Thirty-Six Hours"" and a handful of episode commentaries featuring actors, directors, writers, and guest stars, all of which provide informative behind-the-scenes glimpses into what seems to be a surprisingly cohesive and close-knit family of creators.  This series seems to be evolving itself, creating story as it goes along, and I hope it continues for many seasons to come.",1260403200,,3440,5.383612662942272
3592463,5,B001G0MFME,"Season 5 may be the most in depth of any of the seasons.  After a shortened season 4 (for the same price), this full season is worth the money.  Between the off the wall, but always helpful remarks of Larry, and the interactions between Colby and David, this season is at the top.  If you are a Numbers fan, pick this season up, you won't be disappointed.  The one change that some fans may not like is Meagan left the show, and is replaced by a somewhat irritating (in my opinion) former LAPD officer.  The transition works.  It allows the LAPD to become a slightly more important (and different) aspect than it once was.",1258675200,9,622,4.412280701754386

8303403,5,B001G0MFME,"Enjoyed this series whe it was on prime time.  Now that it is off the air, had to have the dvds.  Play these dvds a lot and as a practicing engineer, I enjoy the use of mathematics to assist in solving the crimes.  Well written stories and characters that I can get behind.",1516060800,,273,4.113207547169812

8303405,2,B001G0MFME,"As the season went on the stories changed from the mathematical to sex. I also didn't like the way it was filmed moving in a constant rapid
circleing. And the outside shots moving rapidly and flashing backbones forth; I found it very annoying and it caused motion sickness if it went on too long. I found Don's character annoying/rude, and he slept with too many people. And the hair cuts styles were terrible and some looked like very greasy hair. It deteriorated as the seasons went on including the plots and story lines.",1509321600,,524,4.645161290322581
8303406,5,B001G0MFME,Another importance point that I would like to raise is that this show has demonstrated a well balanced diversity in both race and gender. Women are not stereotyped and the cast of the actors covers many different races. I have to say this is the show that we should have more of because that reflects how the real life scenario is in the metropolitan cities. Definitely thumbs up to Scott brothers!!,1504742400,,399,4.633802816901408
8303407,5,B001G0MFME,I saw all four seasons but was not able to see the final two seasons. I ordered the final two seasons (5 and 6) not necessarily to see the final two seasons. I used these episodes as teaching tools in an advance math class. We would watch these episodes so students could see and use the applications in real life.,1497225600,,314,4.25
