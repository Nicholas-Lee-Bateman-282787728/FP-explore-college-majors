5773247,3,B00D3XMNUQ,"The CIA has an accident at a secret facility in Rojznov, Romania. The town has turned into zombies and are effectively quarantined. Their plan is not to use drones or tanks to kill the residents, but rather utilize 3 mercenaries and a jailed military man (all from the Steven Seagal School of Fine Acting) to plant a small nuclear device near the nuclear power plant. This is supposed to wipe out the zombies while making their killing look like an accident irregardless of the fact power plants don't explode and make mushroom clouds.

On the plus side, the zombie make-up was great. They used some metal music to make it into a grindhouse style. Besides plot holes you could drive a tank through, the acting was extremely sad. Why did the US president (Uwe Boll) sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger? Was that an insider's joke? Outside of the make-up, the film was less than Asylum grade. As bad as our foursome were in acting, I must give a shout out to Carl Wharton (General Carter) who made them all look good. He was worse than emotionless.

The film might have some camp value and perhaps worth the rental price to hardcore zombie fans. Not a keeper. 3 stars because I did enjoyed some of the stupidity of the plot, bad acting, and Uwe Boll as POTUS.

5773248,2,B00D3XMNUQ,"It was bad very bad - the acting was utterly ridiculous it was almost like a comedy and the lines ""so many wars , so many women"" they truly have to be heard to be believed  almost every scene there was a monstrously bad piece of dialogue ""You know what a big pile of s***e with flies around it looks like , I'm going to create a big pile of s***e"" - That was one of the more witty lines of dialogue! I am not joking you really really really have to see this for the dialogue - virtually every line was cringeworthy.

The main actor was about as dull as Mr Dull McDull from the town of Drab On The Island Of Very Very Tedious.
Great name ""Jack Stone"" - I wonder how many movies have used this combo of hard nut naming convention?
I can only presume he was hired not due to his miniscule acting talent but massive manly frame to go with the equally manly hard-nut name!

As for the female sword wielding ninja mute - oh words evade me just watch it and you will see what i mean!

To be fair the Scottish guy was actually quite funny with lines like ""gonna slow it down chief I'm getting old"" said in that pithy Glaswegian drawl - I am still not sure whether this was by design or pure fluke or perhaps because I empathise with a fellow Glaswegian forced to take part in this carousel of calamity?

Zombie make-up was actually quite good but the whole thing was a disaster and more of a comedy than a serious Zombie flick - view it as a comedy and you might make it through the 1 and a half odd hours of torture!!!

I am giving it two stars just because of the funny scots mercenary!!!
He deserves a badge for making it through this movie as do I!!!",1377302400,,1646,4.080495356037152

I bought this movie for my already 120 piece dvd collection and I wasn't disappointed.

The small errors (two car door-opening sound effects when one of the two doors was already open for example) to insane WTF moments (the tacked on ending that screams some distributors notes of ""ya gotta add some boobies"".... you can shake your head all through this flick. Make it a game with some friends if you have like minded buds but don't expect anything more than a below average attempt to capitalize on the zombie swell of movies.",1396742400,,624,4.73394495412844
5773251,1,B00D3XMNUQ,"Zombie Massacre (Luca Boni and Marco Ristori, 2013)

Be warned (or, perhaps, be heartened): as of this writing, Netflix has Zombie Massacre listed as being directed by Uwe Boll. IMDB informs me that this is not the case, and it was in fact directed by Eaters co-helmers Luca Boni and Marco Ristori. (Boll makes a cameo playing the President of the United States.) Not that this makes the end product any better. In factand you can be assured that I have never said this sentence before, and I would be willing to bet large sums that I will never say it againthis movie might well have been improved by having Boll at the helm. It's that awful.

Plot: Carter (Wrath of the Crows' Carl Wharton), a sleazy general who, it is hinted at one point, is supposed to be the son of a former President (and we've only had one President named Carter, so...), puts together a team of mercenaries to go eradicate a remote village in the Ukraine where the American government has been conducting tests. You see, whatever it was they were testing got out of hand, and the town is now overrun with zombies. At the head of the troop is Jack Stone (Batman and Robin's Christian Boeving), not a mercenary, but Carter is willing to clear his name from a recent nasty court-martial. Under him are Mad Dog McKellen (Revenge's Mike Mitchell), a Scottish demolitions expert who dreams of opening a restaurant; McKellen's best friend Dragan Ilic (The Seasoning House's Daniel Vivian), a Ukrainian sniper; and Eden Shizuka (Delivery's Tara Cardinal), a martial arts expert. Their mission: destroy the town by bombing the nuclear power plant that was the front for the experiments and, as a bonus, find Sam Neumann (Eden Lodge's Ivy Corbin in her first screen appearance), the daughter of the doctor who was at the head of the project before his untimely demise.

Mercenaries? Check. Zombies? Check. Hot chick with swords? Check. I could go on, and that's the problem with this movieit's a paint-by-numbers recreation of a string of scenes you've seen in dozens, maybe hundreds, of better movies (and when I'm looking at something like The Zombie Diaries 2 and thinking it's better than this, man, you've really hit the bottom of the barrel). Well, that's the main problem with this movie. The acting ranges form the barely competent (Corbin is the highlight here; assuming she's not just being elevated by those around her, we should be hearing more from her very soon) to the truly atrocious (Boll), the camerawork is apprentice-level most of the time, the script, written by the directors, should have been, in the words of Herman Melville, published to the flames. When the best thing I can say about a movie is well, I finished it, and it wasn't terribly offensive, well, that should be enough. Avoid like the (zombie) plague. ",1387324800,,2804,4.787190082644628
5773252,3,B00D3XMNUQ,Zombie Massacre is a foreign made zombie film. But it really doesn't add anything new zombie genre. This flick is for zombie fanatics only.,1387238400,,139,4.833333333333333
5773253,1,B00D3XMNUQ,One star is an overstatement for this movie.  I am a big zombie movie fan and I realize that many zombie movies are low budget and never destined to be classical works of art but this is the worst Zombie movie that I have ever seen. It is actually one of the worst movies in general that I ever attempted to watch. The plot is non-existent and the actors are untalented and boring to say the least.  I could not even finish the movie.  I chucked it in the trash.,1386633600,,462,4.111111111111111
5773254,3,B00D3XMNUQ,"Friends, how could a zombie movie have so much right with so much wrong?  Make-up effects were pretty good.  These zombies are of a bacterialogical warfare variety. (no head shots needed)  We have a nuclear plant that is slated to be nuked to rid the area of the zombies and some mercenaries are to set the bomb and get out of there.  Merc's are a hard lot, muscle guy leader, bad a$$ sword woman, bomb guy and his backup that had a name, but to it will always be dead meat.  This is Romania, yet all of the characters speak English.  The redneck that arrives later in the show sounds almost totally authentic except for the small tendacy to end his sentences with Queens English.  Parts had me laughing and I am sure it was not intentional.  They are supposed to be in this big dang hurry, yet they stop every chance they get to talk about little.  Post production seemed to me to piece some parts of the movie out of sequence.  They start out with little ammo (?)  Later near the end-they take out some bad soldiers and leave their full weapons.  I forgot to mention how the over-the-top  boss that hired the mercs betrays them instantly.  Not really a spoiler as that is predictable.
  Check out the cool rides the mercs use to escape in.  At the very end-there are nakid women-so if you don't like the movie-just ff to the end.  ENJOY!",1385251200,,1339,4.373983739837398
5773255,5,B00D3XMNUQ,Gory zombie fun.  It's spooky and reminiscent of old school greats.  Had a great time.  Oh--it will make you jump.,1383177600,,114,4.6
5773256,4,B00D3XMNUQ,"Total zombie gore, nonstop creepy goodness.  Who ISN'T into zombies these days? Movies like these are what started it all.  We wouldn't have The Walking Dead without great zombie movies just like this.",1383177600,,201,5.0606060606060606
5773257,1,B00D3XMNUQ,"I usually judge low budget movies on their own scale.  As compared to a A list movie they are all one or two stars. After all how else can you give these movies a chance? For instance Oasis of the zombies"" from 1982. it's a one star flick , but a three star on the low budget scale of rating. But I couldn't give this one anything but a one star on any level. It's so bad that it's on a video game level. And this came from a video game. Only I don't think it had the absolutely crap idea that the u.s would blow up Romania with a nuke an dthat with all the islands the U.S has that they would do expirements in Romania?  . Nor did the game have a Romanian play a American president who is rotten as the one in this film. In the past Italians made zombie movies that featured Italians and or americans like the great 'zombi' or 'nightmare city' but this is just a nasty film that does nothing right. It takes Hollywood's endless bad u.s. conspiracies and makes them look like masterpieces instead. The head general wears a stupid beard that looks silly even.  The  characters don't act like military people, instead this is just a rotten film that is badly shot and just is about making everyone who is American to be the villain, it's a cartoon movie , only in a bad way.  The actors are not to blame , they needed the work, but man this is bad. And at the end a monster from resident evil suddenly appears, the soldiers stand there and let it kill them. It's just there. IN had this is watchable , but it looks like it was shot on cheap film , which is ok. as they had no money. The zombies run in this one. Which never really works in any zombie movie, lurching maybe , spurts. but it's a bad idea. My last zombie film, 'zombie kill' at least had a lot of humor in it. This one , has none.  It's one thing when cynical u.s. filmmakers make a movie in which all americans are scum,  but when Italians do it , they don't get  it all. I have many really bad movies that have some quality that makes them stay in my collection, this will not be staying.",1379808000,,2052,4.0997506234413965
5773258,1,B00D3XMNUQ,"This is a prime example of wasted acting talents.
With my review,I hope to save some people some money by advising them against this s***ty movie.

Its a story about an American 2 Scots and an Arab (sounds like the start of a bad joke) who have to set a bomb in a nuclear facility and get out so Jack Stone (main character) can be reunited with his daughter.  One of the Scots is a female Ninja that wears way too much makeup (Scottish Ninja......REALLY?!) and  they......yada yada yada......Don't waste your time. But about the worst is the ending scene where bit tit women come out of the swimming pool that turned into zombies and attack the guys at the pool. Did I miss something there? That scene didn't fit with the rest of the so-called plot and script. And speaking of something that didn't fit, the hillbillies on vacation with their hippie van.

I do like the actors in this movie but the 2 guys whom wrote this crap needs to find other work because this obviously isn't the best thing ever. In fact,its in my top 10 worst movies I've ever seen.",1377907200,,1055,4.422680412371134
8589261,3,B00D3XMNUQ,"Ok i wanted to love this film i really did but the cast talks more then the action and the zombies seem to be well held in background, when film came out the trailer had me siting on edge of seat going omg gota get that film lol

its a good film but well ok i did like it lol but man the price is reasonable and the two directors Luca Boni, Marco Ristori. who also did eaters i think made it and well the cameo with Uwe Boll as the (President of the US) makes it wroth watching it,

all and all a ok zombie film to see i guess , the 3 stars is cause well it just didn't have a pace i liked and the actors talked more then i did in this review lol.

P.S they have a sequel coming on dvd in jan 2017 hope its improved cause well it son my list to buy :)",1481155200,,751,3.652173913043478
