8133585,5,B000GNRAYK,"I practically died after watching this! I can't believe I got another chance to watch all my favorite cartoon on 1 dvd! Can you blame me? We're talking about Jem and the Holograms, Rainbow Brite and Lady LoveyLocks (yes that same Lady LovelyLocks) all on one disc. The dvd has a total of 6 episodes. Each show has 2 respective episodes. If were a fan of any or all of these shows back in the day, then you cannot pass on this DVD. Why? Because GIRLS RULE, silly :)
