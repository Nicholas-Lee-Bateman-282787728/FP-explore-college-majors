8600460,5,B00E34A996,"Note : I reviewed this Blu Ray in 2014, but I am writing a review from memory only now :
What great memories I have of this Disk ! Absolutely the best of the best of what lossless 5.1 audio could offer on blu ray. top picture quality, top sound quality. I enjoyed this incredible blu ray concert on my home theater 1080p projector, 7.1 sound ssytem (1700w rated cambridge audio 7.1 amplifier coupled with amazing Triangle speakers and velodyne powerful subwoofer). Emile voice is crisp and detailed, and the music is well recorded and snthesized with some smart 3D sound tricks. It is as if you are at the concert itself. So many great songs by Emile, so many enjoyed hours ! I used this Disk a lot as a showcase material for my system. My guests ended up always so impressed. Highly recommended.",1484352000,,796,4.496551724137931
