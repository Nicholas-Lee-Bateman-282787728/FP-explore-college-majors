7793154,5,084995942X,"Jacob's Gift tells the story of a young Jewish boy who lives at the time of Christ's birth.  Our family loves how it brings the story of the birth of Jesus to life through the eyes of a young boy, the innkeeper's son.

Alabaster's Song shows the night of Christ's birth through the eyes of the angels who announced the birth of Christ to the shepherds in the fields.  Though different from Jacob's gift, the two movies go well together.  I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough for any family with young children.",1391817600,2,515,4.505376344086022
