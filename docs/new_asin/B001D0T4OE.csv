8290766,5,B001D0T4OE,This is the second time I am buying this dvd because my 6yr old and 8 yr old sons have watched it so many times theyve  worn  scratches into it.  Its a well done presentation of these fascinating creatures with an underlying message of conservation.,1509148800,,249,4.488888888888889

8290770,5,B001D0T4OE,I watched this with my wife and 8 year old son and 6 year old son. This is great film work. The photography and narration are fantastic!,1393804800,,136,4.074074074074074
8290771,5,B001D0T4OE,"I am an active saltwater fisherman.  I also regularly read about saltwater fishing (""Marlin"" magazine), and I am a scuba diver.  Billfish (sailfish, marlin, etc.) move great distances at great speed--I am simply amazed at the footage Rick was able to capture for this show/DVD!  I liked the DVD so much, that after the first viewing, I immediately played it again, the second time with my wife and children watching.  It has a great conservation message also.  My only complaint is that I wish the DVD was longer!",1254528000,,513,4.784090909090909
