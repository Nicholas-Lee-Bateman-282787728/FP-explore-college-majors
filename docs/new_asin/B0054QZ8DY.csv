8456929,5,B0054QZ8DY,"I certainly didn't like this production the first time around.  I was expecting a more obvious satire, as R-K intended, of the foolishness of the Russian attack on Japan circa 1907 (?).  Thinking it over, and on second viewing, I realized I had been too closed-minded, and now feel this is an exemplary production.  Orchestra, conducting and singers are excellent.  Barry Banks is an absolute standout as the Astrologer; take a listen to the ones you can find on YouTube and elsewhere and you'll see immediately what I mean.  This DVD is a must-purchase for all opera lovers.  Just sit back and marvel at how the director solved all sorts of production staging problems -- notably the usually unwieldy chorus -- brilliant.  Furthermore, the director has respected both the libretto and the score, my standard for production excellence.  No eurotrash ego here: just directorial brilliance.",1485648000,3,888,5.075862068965518
8456930,5,B0054QZ8DY,"as has been said i too didn't know exactly what to expect.  the only music i was  familiar with was the overture.  that said i was very surprised and pleased to hear many of the themes in the overture beautifully woven into this opera.  it was almost like i already knew this opera very well, even tho this was my very first  contact with it.  if you like rimsky-korsakov's music and  are familiar with the overture to le coq dor  then i heartily recommend this dvd.  you won't be disappointed.",1453161600,2,494,4.4
8456931,5,B0054QZ8DY,"I'm always a little apprehensive of styalized productions of operas, but this one worked.  Overall, I found the production to be throughly enchanting.  I'm glad that I bought it.",1417392000,,178,5.103448275862069
8456932,5,B0054QZ8DY,"Excellent versi&oacute;n, in all ways. Difficult to explain sensations, better see!",1404172800,,83,6.636363636363637
8456933,4,B0054QZ8DY,"I was quite surprised by this charming little opera that actually has deep meaning (people in power being fools among other messages). I did not know what to expect. I knew it was an opera that was popular in the 30s and maybe 40s (before WW II), but I had never seen a production or even video of it. I bought it, because I like Russian opera, and I love Russian ballet.

What a nice surprise! Very interesting opera! It is fringe repertoire, but I think most people will enjoy it.",1315440000,15,482,4.2967032967032965
