8607557,2,B00EON8QPK,"I actually haven't finished this. I watched about 1.5 hours.  It has some interesting information, but the filming is so annoying, it's difficult to watch.  The only way I can describe it is as ""film on top of film"", like having an overlay of one film over another such that neither one is easy to see.  I kept waiting for this to stop, but there were very few parts of what I watched that weren't filmed in this way. The music is also too loud.  I couldn't easily hear the narration or dialogue. There's no use providing information if the filming or music make it too distracting to watch.",1438819200,,591,4.394495412844036
