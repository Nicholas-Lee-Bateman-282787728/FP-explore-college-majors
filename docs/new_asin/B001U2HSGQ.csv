8342632,5,B001U2HSGQ,"Highly recommended.  AIG provides the DVD as well as the MP3s for this 8-part series of PPT-assisted presentations, delivered somewhere in S. California.  Of course, Ken Hamm always lives up to delivering the message.  Snelling hammers out the geologic/antibiblical bias of conventional geology/theology with great fervor.  David Menton's lectures (Menton is retired full professor from U. Washington Med. School) should be listened to by every high school teacher in the country, especially regarding Intelligent Design.  His lecture on ""ape man"" will blow you away. I've listened to/watched these a number of times.  To boot, they are all very entertaining as well.  As a caveat, I highly recommend this series, despite the calvinistic allusions.",1325289600,,748,5.566371681415929
8342633,5,B001U2HSGQ,"This set includes 9 messages given.  Three by Dr. Ken Ham, three by Dr. Andrew Snelling, and three by Dr. David Menton.  All messages are included on DVD, as well as in MP3 audio format so you can just listen on an ipod or from your computer.  The slides and video clips that were shown when their presentations were given are on the DVDs as well.  If you are an atheist and you would like to hear some of the best guys in the field of science who don't hold to evolution, then please consider watching these.  They give a lot of hard evidence, and they refute some major principles that are often overlooked in the evolutionary theory.  This is worth checking out my friends.",1237939200,7,676,4.368
8342634,5,B001U2HSGQ,"This is a fantastic resource for those who want to hear the ""other side"" after so many years of hearing that evolution is fact. This DVD will clear up many questions, give scientific evidence, and give a biblical perspective about the beginning of man.",1237420800,5,252,4.75
8342635,5,B001U2HSGQ,"Answers for Darwin by Ken Ham, Dr. Andrew Snelling and Dr. David Menton is an essential resource for anyone wanting to really know the truth about evolution.  Whatever you believe, you owe it to yourself to listen to what these men have to say.",1237161600,5,244,4.545454545454546
