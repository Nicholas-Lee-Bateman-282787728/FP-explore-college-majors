2457064,1,B000CCD25Q,"""Holocaust"" documentaries are not known for their devotion to accuracy, but few of them reach the extremes of incompetence of this film.  Another reviewer has noted the false claim that Adolf Eichmann was commandant of Auschwitz, but that laughable error occurs a full five minutes into the film.  A mere one minute in, the narrator claims that the Reichstag fire was set by the SS, and that it was merely Nazi propaganda that it was set by a communist.  This lie is still widely believed, but ever since the publication of Fritz Tobias' book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reichstag-Fire/dp/B000KIRU8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reichstag Fire</a>&nbsp;a Nazi role in setting the fire has been a fringe idea at best.

Six minutes in we see the famous tree hanging photo, a staple of holocaust lore, which appeared at the Dachau museum as late as 2001.  Allegedly taken at Buchenwald, it appears to show prisoners hanging by their arms from trees, while a German guard looks on.  In reality, this photo was created in 1958 for an East German (i.e. communist) propaganda film. [Reference: Obenaus, Herbert. ""Das Foto vom Baumh&auml;ngen - ein Bild geht um die Welt,"" Gedenkst&auml;tten-Rundbrief, no. 68, October 1995, pp. 3-8.]

These examples should suffice to illustrate the nature of this fraudulent ""documentary.""",1359849600,,1361,5.577669902912621
2457065,1,B000CCD25Q,"This DVD is terrible, especially given the rich subject matter.  I had the chance to visit the Dachau memorial a few years ago, and this DVD doesn't even begin to scratch the surface in offering insight into what took place there.  Some of the buildings still remain today, and these are fascinating in a terrifying way.  I had hoped for current footage of these buildings, the guard towers, and the fences, much in the way that ""Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State"" offered a look at that camp.  I had also hoped for insght into daily camp life, the treatment of prisoners and the mindset of the SS.  Instead, the DVD offers footage of various Nazi rallies and a meandering account of the expansion of the Third Reich, always concluding by stating that dissidents of the occupied country ended up in Dachau.  There is some footage of the camp, then and now, but no real explanation of what is being seen.  Worst of all, the DVD is riddled with historical inaccuracies.  For example, Adolf Eichman is said to have been commandant at Auschwitz, something which everyone would agree is clearly false.  And the gas chamber at Dachau is said to have been used to murder prisoners using ""pressurized"" cyanide gas.  First of all, most historians agree that the gas chamber at Dachau was never used.  At Auschwitz-Birkinau, where cyanide gas was used, the SS dumped the chemical into the chambers in crystal form and allowed the gas to simply evaporate from the crystals; again, I think all historians would agree that pressurized gas was never used.  The portion on Sachsenhausen is just as bad.  I'm going to try and re-sell this stinker as soon as I can.",1351036800,2,1647,4.716783216783217
2457066,2,B000CCD25Q,"I worked my way through these series of DVDs focusing on the infamous camps operated by the Nazis during WW II. In ""Holocaust - Dachau and Sachsenhausen"", the narrator states that Adolf Eichmann was the Commandant at Auschwitz! This is not true - Eichmann was never the Commandant at Auschwitz, he was the architect of the Final Solution, managing the herculean task of facilitating the transportation of millions of Jews to ghettoes and extermination/concentration camps throughout Europe. The most famous commandant of Auschwitz was Rudolf Hoss, who was eventually hanged for his crimes against humanity in 1947. The footage did not reflect anything new, as most of it has already been covered in other documentaries covering the Holocaust. The focus is more on the rise of the Third Reich and not as much on the camps themselves. Disappointing, rent if you must.",1267920000,15,865,5.098591549295775
