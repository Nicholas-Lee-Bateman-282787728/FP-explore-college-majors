898157,5,6304523912,"As a long-time fan of the old motion picture serials, I've had the pleasure of seeing (and now, thanks to video, owning) many of the greats from the ""golden age"" of movie serials.
From Batman to Zorro, the Lone Ranger to Flash Gordon, or Dick Tracy to Captain Marvel, they all had their own special appeal and allure, although all too often there were signficant differences in quality and production values.  Every fan had a favorite.  However, for me and millions of other fans, no serial ever made was more exciting, entertaining, or intense as the action-packed thrills and perils found in ""Jungle Girl.""
Loosely based upon the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name and released in 1941 by Republic Pictures, the film starred beautiful Frances Gifford as Nyoka, the Jungle Girl.  Unusal for the period, this was the first attempt (since the silent days of Pearl White) to feature a female as the lead in a movie serial.
Doubled by stunt ace David Sharpe, Nyoka swung through the trees with an acrobatic skill unseen in the much higher budgeted Tarzan films.  Fighting diamond hunting gangsters and savage natives, she successfully endures 15-chapters of perils from lethal fire traps, avalanches, drownings, poison gas, falls from cliffs, and quicksand, to name a few.
Opposed by Shamba, the Witch Doctor, one of the scariest villains in serial history, Nyoka barely survives to defeat her enemies and save the day.  Considered one of the best serials ever made (and definitely the best jungle serial ever made), Jungle Girl was directed by the cream of action directors, William Witney and John English.  It was so successful, the following year it spawned an even more popular sequel, ""Perils of Nyoka.""
For an example of the motion picture serial at its best, you can't do much better than ""Jungle Girl"" or its sequel.  It's influence is felt to this day by modern serial fans like Steven Speilberg and George Lucas and many of their films, particularly the Indiana Jones series, owes a debt of gratitude to this long gone, but not forgotten, American art form.

898357,4,6304523912,"Starring the lovely Francis Gifford as the indomitable Nyoka, this classic serial displays all the low-budget delights of the movie cliffhanger, complete with deadly traps, unconvincing gorillas, evil witch doctors & natives of dubious ethnicity, and a rugged, stalwart male lead to aid the Jungle Girl in her many struggles on the way to a cheerfully corny conclusion.

I'm not phrasing it that way out of mockery. Anyone knows going in that this sort of thing was shot on the fly, as cheaply as possible, without any artistic pretensions. What matters is how well it was done within those considerable limitations. And in this case, they did very well indeed. The serial is charged with energy & excitement, and Frances Gifford is sexy, plucky, and absolutely delightful to watch. You just have to fall into its small-scale ambience & become an eager kid once more, hungry for adventure & thrills.

898359,5,6304523912,"Amazon has not only linked reviews of VCI's release of ""Jungle Girl"" to an ""import"" edition, but also placed both DVD versions under the same heading in their product listings.  Sorting the reviews is difficult, with both described as ""format: DVD"" on the line that should indicate the product.  Since the two are not the same, I have updated (26 June 2017) my review to include both.  VCI's is decidedly preferable.  See details below, after my long-winded description of the serial.

As for the serial, ""Jungle Girl"" was released by Republic in 1941, directed by their ""golden age"" team of William Witney and John English.  The story is loosely based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel of the same name, with screenplay by Ronald Davidson, Norman S. Hall, William Lively, Joseph O'Donnell, Joseph F. Poland and Alfred Batson, which ought to be enough writers to keep the action stirred up.

The story has Nyoka (Frances Gifford) and her father, Doctor John Meredith (Trevor Bardette) providing medical aid to an African tribe.  His medicine has proven superior to the voodoo of tribal witch doctor Shamba (Frank Lackteen) and after having cured Chief Lutembi (Al Kikume) of jungle fever Meredith was given custody of the Lion Amulet, a symbol of authority that allows access to the tribe's cache of diamonds, used by the doctor to obtain needed medical supplies.  A pilot, Jack Stanton (Tom Neal) unwittingly brings to the tribe's village a crook, Slick Latimer (Gerald Mohr) who is plotting to get the diamonds with help from Meredith's evil twin brother Bradley, whose existence is unknown to Nyoka.  The Doctor is murdered, and impersonated by Bradley, but meanwhile Shamba gets possession of The Amulet.

The rest of the serial involves a three-way battle for The Amulet and the diamonds.  Stanton has to rescue Nyoka, and vice-versa many times, and it takes quite a while for them to discover the evil doings of Latimer and the identity of the supposed Dr. Meredith, giving Republic's technical effects team plenty of work in creating elaborate death traps.  It's hard to believe that this tribe came up with the hardware guarding the diamonds, with gates to flood the tunnels and trap doors operated by stone levers, when they otherwise use rope-and-log technology, and Shamba can't seem to get his Rube Goldberg inspired execution devices to work.  While the tribe doesn't look very ""African,"" Stanton tells Latimer that ""they drifted down here from the Sahara Desert centuries ago"" and in any case it was filmed not far from the jungle with similar natives used by Columbia for ""The Phantom.""

Tom Neal is athletic-looking and an adequate hero, even if he has a moustache and brought that nasty Slick Latimer to the village in the first place.  Gerald Mohr's ability to maintain an evil smirk through fifteen chapters, with the salesman suit and tie for jungle attire makes him a terrific villain, sometimes aided, other times opposed by veteran ""foreign"" bad guy Frank Lackteen.  And we really want to believe Frances Gifford can do all those stunts, even if we know it is Helen Thurston and David Sharpe swinging on the vines.  Helping Stanton and Nyoka are sidekick Curley (Eddie Acuff) who keeps the comedy under control, and native child Kimbu, played by Tommy Cook, who was Little Beaver in ""Adventures of Red Ryder"" a year earlier.

Republic had a reputation for making the best serials, but their strength was in the action, costumes and special effects, while other aspects were less than they might have been.  Much of each chapter is used to set up the cliffhanger, showing how the trap is going to work, so there isn't much time for plot development.  This was accepted at the time for the remarkable thrills provided by those cliffhangers, and the same is true for most viewers today, though keeping all that action from looking redundant is one of the main reasons that serials should be watched with a day or more between chapters.

VCI's edition, #8265 (ASIN: B000051S39) is on two discs and uses a print identified as being from the National Film and Television Archive.  VCI includes a note on the package insert, ""Special thanks goes to Fred Shay who was
instrumental in making this classic available once again.""  Under the Republic logo in the opening title is  ""Distributed Throughout Great Britain and Ireland by British Lion Film Corporation Ltd.""  There is minor flicker and some distortion in the sound during this title, but both problems go away during the chapters.  The image is sharp, corner to corner, with good gray scale, properly framed, and the sound up to expectations for 1941 without need of significant ""noise reduction.""  A couple chapters have the wrong MPPDA certificate number, but this would have little meaning outside the U.S., and the chapters are all headed by the correct approval notices from the British Board of Film Censors.  The ""extras"" on Disc 1 are a ""gallery"" with 25 still pictures and posters for the serial, and ""biographies"" of Frances Gifford, Tom Neal, Eddie Acuff, Trevor Bardette and directors William Witney and John English.  The ""biographies"" have a very slow-scrolling text that can't be hastened by scan or fast play controls, though it is possible to pause them. The main menu itself has a long response time, and requires a page change to get to the last four chapters.  The second disc has the same pictures and ""biographies"" plus 24 serial movie trailers, indexed but not individually shown in the menu, for ""Tim Tyler's Luck,"" ""The Master Key,"" ""The Mysterious Mr. M,"" ""Mystery of the Riverboat,"" ""Riders of Death Valley,"" ""The Royal Mounted Rides Again,"" ""Jungle Queen,"" ""Raiders of Ghost City,"" ""Lost City of the Jungle,"" ""The Phantom Creeps,"" ""The Great Alaskan Mystery,"" ""Winners of the West,"" ""The Fighting Marines,"" ""Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island,"" ""Junior G-Men of the Air,"" ""Adventures of Frank Merriwell,"" ""Radio Patrol,"" ""Don Winslow of the Navy,"" ""Gang Busters,"" ""Tailspin Tommy,"" ""Scouts to the Rescue,"" ""Adventures of Red Ryder,"" ""Zorro Rides Again"" and ""Radar Men from the Moon.""  Whew!

Since I wrote this review five years ago, ""burned"" media has become more common especially with DVDs of lower demand.  By now most people probably know if their players are compatible with double-layer ""burned"" discs, but some reviews have noted special problems with this release.  I have found a couple players that work fine with disc 1, but can't read disc 2.  The second layer of disc 2 has only three trailers on it, about seven minutes, and the large amount of unused space can affect compatibility, especially with older players.

The ""import"" edition (ASIN: B005MQ586I) is from Rocket DVD of Australia, and its best feature is that it is on three single-layer discs of the conventional ""pressed"" variety, which should work on any DVD player.  The menu is less complicated and responds faster than VCI's, though the background music is quite loud, and it returns to the menu after each chapter.  There are no ""extra"" features on the DVDs, but the 14mm thick triple-disc case is made of clear plastic, so it possible to read notes about the actors printed on the back of the insert having the cover art by Graeme Dickenson, ""noted underground Australian illustrator"" according to Rocket's website.  The bad news is the video transfer quality.  Like VCI's, it has the opening Republic logo with the distribution notice from British Lion Films Incorporated, and while it doesn't have the notices preceding that title, nor any information about how the copy was obtained, it could easily be from the same source.  The sound is similar in quality, distorted in the opening Republic title and good for the era elsewhere.  The image isn't as sharp as VCI's, but still fairly tolerable in that respect.  What isn't very tolerable is the limited number of video levels, which cause odd patterns and blotchy areas especially in the darker parts of the picture and when the scene fades to black.  At some scene changes there is a ""venetian blind"" effect, momentary horizontal lines.  Even worse is the jerky motion present throughout, likely from poor frame-rate conversions.  Not hard to guess how this edition was sourced.

Despite the issue with the ""burned"" media, VCI's release is highly recommended to fans of serials.  The print source is better than what was used for the old edition on VHS, and the serial itself good enough that if problems are encounterd playing VCI's discs, it would be worth searching for a machine that works with them.  But unless the cover art is a major attraction, I'd suggest skipping the Rocket edition.",1341792000,5,8626,4.972841225626741
898360,1,6304523912,"The Johnny Weissmuller ""Tarzan"" films are 5-stars. I also liked the Ron Ely ""Tarzan"" series.

""Jungle-Girl"" is not believable, and not interesting.

The natives are noticeably white-guys wearing afro wigs. That was enough to kill my interest at the start.

One of the explorers is wearing a heavy suit and tie, supposedly in the jungle and heat of Africa.

I did not like the good-guys. None of the characters have any personality. The explorers steal the diamonds from the natives, so we cheer for the natives.

There is no story; just the natives chasing jungle-girl around, again and again on the same set.

Republic got away with low-budget, hasty-script, one-week-shoots, in westerns, because they had Roy Rogers singing and bantering with Dale Evans, and a formula of chases on horseback, fist-fights, shoot-outs, and a pretty girl. ""Jungle-Girl"" is only a low-budget, hasty-script, one-week shoot on the L.A. back-lot without any creativity or effort.

898361,5,6304523912,"This has to be in the top three of my favorite old films. Of course, as it is a Serial presentation, there's plenty of action in every episode and it never drags. And, even better, as you watch it on a rainy Saturday afternoon, you can doze off and on and each time you wake up, you're pretty much right back up to speed on what has happened -- that's the way they wrote these great episodes.

Here we have a 1941, high-quality print, Black-and-White film from Republic Pictures, broken down into 15 episodes on two discs, running 267 minutes all total! Here are the episode titles:

1. Death by Voodoo
2. Queen of the Beasts
3. River of Fire
4. Treachery
5. Jungle Vengeance
6. Tribal fury
7. The Poison Dart
8. Man Trap
9. Treasure Tomb
10. Jungle Killer
11. Dangerous Secret
12. Trapper
13. Ambush
14. Diamond Trail
15. Flight to Freedom

Frances Gifford plays the lead as, Nyoka, the female version of Tarzan. She can pretty much do anything from swinging on grapevines through the jungle to riding elephants. She gets along great with the natives (except for one noxious medicine man who's jealous of Nyoka and her doctor father) and the animals in the jungle are, for the most part, just wild about her.

The story, (based upon a book by Edgar Rice Burroughs), is essentially this: An isolated African tribe maintains watch over millions of dollars worth of diamonds in a nearby, secret and sacred cave. Nyoka and her father (a doctor), watch over the natives, helping them make due from day to day. As for the cave, it requires the use of a sacred amulet to enter and, therefore, becomes much in demand as the story evolves. Some good guys, as well as some really nefarious bad guys, fly into this secluded region and, over the course of 15 episodes, it's Nyoka and her meager crew fighting against a pack of scoundrels who just want the diamonds for personal wealth. The confused natives switch sides, back and forth, numerous times during the film.

There's lots of shooting, stabbing, getting thrown over cliffs, gorilla attacks, crude bamboo weapons that mash and grind.... on and on. Just great stuff!

There IS one other Nyoka Serial, (with Kay Aldridge as Nyoka), which I like just slightly better than ""Jungle Girl"":

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nyoka-and-the-Tigermen/dp/B000003NZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nyoka and the Tigermen</a>

However, this preference is just my personal opinion -- you may, in fact, enjoy the Frances Gifford Nyoka better. You will also notice that the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nyoka-and-the-Tigermen/dp/B000003NZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nyoka and the Tigermen</a>&nbsp;is only available in VHS tape. Folks with DVD recorders will be interested to know that this two-tape set is NOT copy-protected so you can draw whatever conclusions that you wish from that fact.

Anyway, ""Jungle Girl"" is a superb entry and I give it my highest recommendation to appropriate fans of such nostalgic films.",1212105600,4,3030,5.2181069958847734
898362,5,6304523912,"To my surprise I did not enjoy this serial among serials the second time aaround as much as when I was a kid. I thought the Perils of Nyoka was more mobile and exotic and helped by one of the three greatest soundtrack scores of all time. I still thrill to Glickman's great music.(king of the Royal Mounted and Zorro's Fighting Legion are the others) Jungle Girl is, nevertheless, a bit of history, well acted and filmed. It helped plant seeds in my generation that grew to today's different and better idea of

898365,5,6304523912,"The great director William Witney felt that this was his best serial.  It was the first serial to star a woman in the featured role.  Unfortunately, both leads had tragic ends.  As did the elephant who graces the opening credits,  a movie veteran who burned to death in a truck fire years later.

Frances Gifford, the younger sister of NFL great Frank Gifford, was beautiful and an excellent actress.  A terrible auto accident in 1949 wrecked her career.  She tried a comeback in the early 1950's, but her health was so bad she couldn't make it, and spent quite a lot of time in a mental hospital.  She recovered sufficiently  in later life to devote herself to charitable causes.  Frances Gifford died in 1994 at age 73.

Tom Neal was the quintessential low-budget film noir hero.  He had achieved notoriety at an early age when his father kept him from eloping with Inez Martin, a buxom former Follies girl and mistress of slain mobster Arnold Rothsrein.  By the early '50s, Neal was well-known for his off-screen escapades.  He famously brawled with Franchot Tone over starlet Barbara Payton, breaking Tone's cheekbone and giving him a brain concussion.  Tom Neal was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the shooting death of his third wife, Gale Bennett, and served six years in prison.  He died of a heart attack in 1972 at age 58.

Incidentally, their buddy in this picture, Eddie Acuff, was the brother of Roy Acuff, and played this kind of role in pictures for years.  He's best known as the postman that Dagwood constantly runs into when late for work in the ""Blondie"" movies.

The great stuntman Davy Sharpe did much of the doubling in this picture, including the vine-swinging scenes for Frances Gifford.  Gifford was also doubled by Helen Thurston.

This two-disk set has 10 chapters on Disk One and 5 chapters on Disk Two.  The second disk is filled up with prevues of 24 other serials, lasting about an hour.",1136678400,11,1933,4.759036144578313

Of course don't forget the vilains : Latimer (Gerald Mohr, great actor of B-movies) and Shamba (Frank Lackteen). What would have been serials without such figures ? Even, I'm a newcomer in this genre, it's obvious for everyone that serials described the eternal fight between good and evil. Another point is very interesting : Serials have sometimes female heros (think about Linda Stirling in the very masculine part of Zorro !).
The DVD quality is really good. The picture looks sharp most of the time and the sound is also OK. The trailers of other serials (in the bonus area) are very entertaining and of course interesting for someone like me who discovers this little gems from another time !

From Batman to Zorro, the Lone Ranger to Flash Gordon, or Dick Tracy to Captain Marvel, they all had their own special appeal and allure.  Granted, although all too often there were signficant differences in quality and production values, every fan had a favorite. And, for me and millions of other fans, no serial ever made was more exciting, entertaining, or intense as the action-packed thrills and perils found in ""Jungle Girl.""
Loosely based upon the Edgar Rice Burroughs novel of the same name and released in 1941 by Republic Pictures, the film starred beautiful Frances Gifford as Nyoka, the Jungle Girl. Unusal for the period, this was the first attempt (since the silent days of Pearl White) to feature a female as the lead in a movie serial.
Doubled equally by Helen Thurston and stunt ace David Sharpe, Nyoka swung through the trees with an acrobatic skill unseen in the much higher budgeted Tarzan films. Fighting diamond hunting gangsters and savage natives, she successfully endures 15-chapters of some of the best cliffhanger perils ever filmed . . . from lethal fire traps, avalanches, drownings, poison gas, falls from cliffs, and quicksand, just to name a few.
Opposed by ""Slick"" Latimer and Shamba, the Witch Doctor, (for me, one of the scariest villains in serial history) Nyoka barely survives to defeat her enemies and save the day. Universally considered one of the best serials ever made (and definitely the best jungle serial ever made), Jungle Girl was directed by the cream of action directors, William Witney and John English. It was so successful, the following year it spawned an even more popular sequel, ""Perils of Nyoka.""
For an example of the motion picture serial at its best, you can't do much better than ""Jungle Girl"" or its sequel. It's influence is felt to this day by modern serial fans like Steven Speilberg and George Lucas and many of their films, particularly the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series, owes a debt of gratitude to this long gone, but not forgotten, American art form.",985651200,38,2287,4.849104859335038
898443,5,6304523912,"I came to this serial in backward fashion. First, as a kid, I discovered the Nyoka comic books. Later, I got to see the excellent ""Perils of  Nyoka"" which was a semi-sequel to this one (even though the Nyoka in  the second serial was not only a different actress but a different  character; only the name preserved the tradition). Finally, I got to see  the original source for Nyoka (well, not counting the Edgar Rice Burroughs  book which inspired the first serial). Gerald Mohr, whose varied career  included playing Phillip Marlowe on the radio detective series, and being  the voice of the masked Scorpion in ""The Adventures of Captain  Marvel"" serial, turned in many fine villainous performances of which  this was one. But Frances Gifford (who visited the jungle once more, in a  later Johnny Weissmuller picture, ""Tarzan Triumphs,"" in 1943)  made a beautiful and athletic-looking Nyoka. And some of the stunt  sequences, including one in which she SOMERSALTS from one vine to another,  make Tarzan's vine-swinging seem anemic. Incidentally, Gifford had a female  stunt double mostly, although it is true that stuntman David Sharpe did  double Kay Aldridge in the second Nyoka serial.",967248000,9,1191,5.06701030927835
898444,4,6304523912,"In the mid-1940s, when my friend Stewart and I were in grammar school, we saw this memorable serial during the Saturday matinees at the Fairfax Theater in Jacksonville, Florida. Each week there was a cowboy movie, a  feature movie, a cartoon, a newsreel, sometimes a short subject, a preview  and of course the adventure serial. We always looked forward with great  anticipation to the serial, especially this one. We loved Nyoka , the  jungle girl. Frances Gifford was a dish, but that aspect was not the reason  for our affection, at least we didn't think it was, regardless of the  mini-skirt. Well, maybe there was a little bit of sex appeal, but we were  just kids and didn't recognize what it may have been. Remember, this was in  those days long ago when it was not deemed necessary to teach sex to little  children in the schools and we were indeed quite innocent. We would go home  and play that we were saving Nyoka from imagined peril in our fantasy games  of adventure. A little later we would also be going home and playing Batman  and Robin when that serial showed up. Anyway, Nyoka the jungle girl was a  heroine and we admired her and her friend Jack. We enjoyed Nyoka's friend  Curley and disliked Shamba the evil witch doctor. Now, Slick Latimer we  despised. I was not aware that he even had a first name until recently; we  just called him Latimer. Anyway, he and Shamba were always getting our  three friends into mortal trouble, especially Nyoka. But, that was to be  expected because he was one of the bad guys. What made him special was not  what he did; it was the way he did it. He was a sneaky louse and after he  did the dastadly deed du jour, Latimer would drop his head and give us this  sidelong, twisted little smirk. Boy, that got us mad enough to chew-up the  theater seat cushions. In this part, Gerald Mohr played one of the best  screen villains I have seen. It was that infuriating little sneer that had  so much to do with it. Oh, how we looked forward to the fifteenth episode  when we knew that he would finally pay for it. Gerald Mohr had an actors  gift of being able to make little boys mad at him. Well, that may not seem  like much, but look at it this way, I still remember it after over  fifty-five years. There wasn't a sneer that good until Richard Widmark  showed up some years later with his sadistic thug's snigger. But Richard  had to make a noise with his.",948585600,7,2411,4.413636363636364

I agree that Jungle Girl is the best jungle serial yet. The transfer was made from a recently found master print. It appears that the print was one that was sent to England to be shown in British and Irish movie theaters. The DVD copy is crystal clear as is the sound track. Its as though the serial was filmed just a year or so ago. If you are a lover of old movies, including black and white and a lover of the serials then this is a definite must for viewing and your movie library. I would give it ten stars if I could",1495843200,,656,4.1328125
