993224,5,6305223386,"A brilliant production of a notoriously difficult play. This is a theatre production adapted for television, which means you get no horses and windswept landscapes; what you get is a compelling story told by a director  with a contemporary vision, and some incredibly powerful acting. Ian Holm's  hard-edged Lear is a victim of his own violent passions, the fool, old and  fat, is both funny and heartbreaking, the usually wimpy Cordelia in this  version emerges as a strong-willed, compassionate young woman, and her evil  sisters are real human beings, not fairy tale characters. Some of the  soliloquies are missing, but otherwise the text is only slightly abridged  and rearranged. A performance of 'King Lear' worthy of Shakespeare's play.  The Bard is back - with a vengeance!",949622400,12,782,5.150793650793651
993225,3,6305223386,"Beautiful red sets that conjure a sense of foreboding.  Actors, particularly Helm, rush through their lines as though they're in a hurry.  The soundtrack is inaudible and the text is mumbled.",943920000,3,191,5.129032258064516
993226,4,6305223386,"Ian Holm and cast are in top form as the tale of the collapse of two families is examined.  This version is rich in nuance and texture and is not afraid to take chances with the set and it's modern-abstract  setting.
The only short coming to my taste was the actor who played the  Fool.  Being totally subjective, I found his diction hard to understand at  times and that makes things doubly difficult considering the Fool is  difficult to understand even with the best diction.
This version gave me  a new appreciation for the roles of Edmund and Edgar, as well.
Very well  done!",930528000,7,580,4.509615384615385
993412,2,6305223386,"This is a production totally without nuance and its owes that to the bellowing of Ian Holm. Holm as Lear bellows at the beginning. he bellows in the middle. And he belows at the end. Lear bellows when he is dividing teh kingdom. he bellows then he rejects Cordelia. he bellows when he realises that he has been betrayed by Goneriel and Regan. The character presented as Lear is entirely one dimensional. Any change of circumstance or emotion is presented as more bellowing. There is no tragedy in this production because there is no change in Lear from beginning to end.

This DVD is not worth buying.",1176595200,5,601,4.616822429906542
993473,2,6305223386,The play was well done by Ian Holm. Their were a few inconsistencies such as:Though they were played very well Goneril and Regan seem a bit old for their respective parts. Barbara Flynn seemed old enough to be Lear's wife and Regan seems to grab the attention away from the other sisters since she is a blonde. The clothing was out of date and other discrepancies such as LAND MINES!?!,1132012800,,385,4.514285714285714
993474,2,6305223386,I really liked the actress who played Cordellia. She brouhgt that sense of innocence that i pictured her having. She played the emotions really well. I did not like the actors performance of King Lear. He made King Lear seem a lot more crazy then he really was. The actor playing Edmund i thought played him well.,1132012800,,313,4.508771929824562
993475,3,6305223386,"It was a decent production with good acting but was obviously budget judging from the boring stage and costume. The acting was decent despite several yelling and mumbling problems and King Lear seemed crazy long before the play called for it. It had decent acting and if you're familiar with the play keeping up won't be a problem. Otherwise, go read it.",1132012800,2,354,4.725806451612903
993476,3,6305223386,"I thought that the acting was over all pretty good. There is deffinately room for critism though. I thought that there was way too much unnecessary screaming and mumbling throughout the play. At the beginning of the play when King Lear is speaking to his daughters, he becomes overwhelmingly angry and jumps up on the table. This event confussed me because I wasn't sure if he was already insane or not. I did like the idea of having all of the walls red. That was a good idea so that the viewer could pay attention to what was going on in the play. Overall I did not enjoy the movie though. I guess I was able to learn somethings from the film and benefited from watching it...Hopefully if someone remakes the play in a movie again, it will be more interesting and exciting...",1132012800,2,777,4.440559440559441
993477,2,6305223386,"This movie did not attract my attention as much as I thought it would. The movie didn't have good stage setting, acting, dressing, and actors to fit the description of the people in the play. The movie lost my attention at the beginning when it showed how slack the movie set-up was. Next time they make a King Lear movie they need to fix all of the things above so that I won't fall asleep in the middle of class.",1132012800,,414,4.1875
993478,2,6305223386,"I didn't really like this film, but I guess it got the point across. I was surprised as to how well the actors played the parts, and how well they remembered the Shakesperean lines. The setting however way to cheap and would have never made it to Hollywood, but it would have made it to the producers of the Goodwill films. There was way to much screaming in the play which made it hard for me to stay focused on. I found Victoria Hamlet, or Codelia, to be less prettier than her sisters, which was ironic. Edgar was not aggressive enough with Edmund, which made him look like a big queer. So if you haven't watched it don't waste your time.",1132012800,,641,4.305785123966942
993479,3,6305223386,"The movie overall was not very good. The actors either mumbled or screamed so it was hard to understand what they were saying. The setting was cheap, which would not have made it to Hollywood and I didn't like the one main color of red although it did fit the tone of the movie. The actors and actresses did a good job at acting and making their emotions present, it was just that they were close when when talking to each other. The costumes could have been from the same time or could have been created a ceratin theme. David Burke did a very well job at disguising Kent. Also, Barbara Flynn and Amanda Redman did a very well job at showing how evil Goneril and Regan were. My portrayal of Cordelia did not fit the movie, because I thought she would have been prettier even though she was young. The ages of Goneril and Regan could have been younger. Edgar was suppose to be a beggar, but everytime he was in a new scene he was in a new costume. Lear's character would have been more believable if he didn't start acting crazy at the beginning. Some scenes such as the storm was staged poorly. Therefore, I believe this movie would have been better if character fit my potrayal of the play.",1132012800,,1192,4.349775784753363
993480,2,6305223386,"This movie was acceptable lighting and staging wise, but the costumes seemed to be a strange mixture of different time periods.  At the beginning, Lear's attendants looked like a S.W.A.T. team, and at the end of the play Edger, who'd already had far too many costume changes, was dressed as an executioner.  The actors screamed and mumbled their lines, which may have distracted them for focusing on more important things, like being believable characters and staying true to the play.  All the actors had their moments when they seemed to show the appropriate level of accuracy to the characters, but that was usually when they weren't speaking.  All in all, if it were a real movie, I would have waited for it to come out on HBO, and even then, I might have only viewed it while something more interesting was on a commercial break.",1132012800,,834,4.731034482758621
993560,2,6305223386,"Holm does a fine job portraying ""King Lear."" I do believe that it would be a very hard part to portray. As I have only seen this production of ""King Lear"" I do not believe this would be the very best possible production(at least I hope not). The movie contained to much screaming, too much mumbling and not enough clear tone to comprehend. The set was obviously low budget and did not take much time to set up and film. Overall I probably would not like to see this production again.",1132012800,,483,4.318681318681318
993561,2,6305223386,"When I first learned that I would be watching King Lear in my English class I was greatly over-joyed. Firstly because we never get to watch videos in class, and secondly because I was curious to visually see the play. However, upon watching the first minutes of the play I felt like watching the movie was more like punishment than pleasure. The costumes made the characters look like they were on spaceship flying towards another planet. The simple sets didn't fit the extravagant lifstyle I thought a King would lead. The actors, though they were talented, did not fit what I visualized the characters to look like. I must say that with the simple costumes and sets it did help me focus on the dialogue of the play. Visually seeing the dialogue come to life gave me a better understanding of the play. I would not recommend this video for entertainment but for learning purposes only.",1132012800,,886,4.685897435897436
993562,2,6305223386,"The BBC production of king Lear was a good portal of Shakespeare's original except that historically inaccurate throughout the production and the lack of good actors took away from the production itself. However, I will say that David Burke as Kent and Timothy West as Gloucester fit there roles well as well as done very good acting in this production, even though surrounded be some horrible acting. Sometimes the actors couldn't be understood because they were so focused on mumblings and screaming. Then the inaccurate data such as the rubber tires on the cart, Gloucester's filling in his teeth, and the Fool's custom which was not of the period. Therefore, I didn't like this production because I myself couldn't ignore the inaccurate data, and the bad acting however the storyline itself is a good one.",1132012800,,809,5.0
993563,3,6305223386,"The play was very exciting to watch.  I think everyone played their role very good except, I really didn't like the weakness in Edgar's role.  The fool was very interesting, but nothing I would have imagined.  There was mumbling going on in some parts of the play that I couldn't understand.  All in all it was very good and I wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.",1132012800,,363,4.454545454545454
993564,2,6305223386,"King Lear was fine, but I don't want to see it again. The acting was okay, nobody stood out or struck me as having great talent; the weren't terrible. I think the set and costume were a little to boring, I would expect a little more extravagence, being that he was a king. Maybe they did it to keep the focus on the dialogue because they were speaking in the shakespearian language. However, the dialogue was still hard to follow. The diction of the actors wasn't to great. Either they were yelling making it hard to understand, or they were mumbling. Kent was probablly the best casted actor in the movie, and the easiest to understand. I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie, and I don't want to see it again.",1132012800,,721,4.428571428571429
993565,3,6305223386,"I thought the movie of King Lear was an okay film. Though the play's production and set seemed cheaped,the acting caught my attention.  However, my perception of some of the characters appearances within the book completely surprised me. I would have preferred King Lear to be muchmore taller. Cordelia could have been more attractive(Cordelia resembled Micheal Jackson). Edgar seemed like he should have been the better looking than Edmund and much more stronger. The productionwasn't superb at all! Yet considering it was a play, the setting worked.  Overall, the movie got Shakespeare's point across well, but I wouldn't have paid anything to watch this film in a local theatre.",1132012800,,681,5.238532110091743
993566,5,6305223386,The best version of Lear anyone could ever hope to see!  I especially liked the loudness of the lines and the lighting during the storm.  I also liked the packaging.  The casting was outstanding except for the fool.  The fool should have been younger and more colorful so that he could have been played by the same actress who played Cordelia.,1132012800,,343,4.573770491803279
993567,3,6305223386,"I did not really enjoy this version of King Lear.  It bothered me that the set stayed the same for almost the entire movie.  Though this may have contributed to the audience focusing more on the action, it disturbed me that when it started raining, the actors looked like they were still inside.  I thought the actors screamed all too much, and when they were not screaming, they were mumbling.  This made it hard for me to take the characters seriously because it was hard to understand them.  Also, the actors who played Edgar and Cordelia came off as a little too dramatic and soft.  Edgar acted like a pansy throughout the play, and Cordelia did not act as strong as I pictured her when I first read the play.  Overall, I believe that BBC could have done a better job with what they had.",1132012800,,791,4.413793103448276
993568,3,6305223386,"I believe the overall play's attention was diverted to the cheap low ,budget production cost, even though the actors themself made it a watchable production.  The dull scenery of lifeless, assorted paints, with no detail, provided to any set was a bore and really killed it for me.  With the acception of Edgar's armor, there was no real outstandish wardrobe either.  On a good note I liked Ian Holm as Lear, because it made it more interesting and funnier.  Seeing a guy five feet tall, ordering everyone around, with a humorous temper suited the character well.  Goneril and Regan played well in there part, and were the conniving, evil sisters they were sought out to be.  As for Cordelia, I thought she could have been more vibrant and beautiful as to standout, and seperate her more from her sisters.  The overall play was cut short by the dull scenery, but was gradually recovered by the acting, and actors chosen.  If it came on t.v. and there was nothing else on I might take a glance at it.",1132012800,,999,4.604519774011299
993569,3,6305223386,"Having seen no other production of the play, I thought it was a pretty good movie.  However, I had no basis for comparison.  I did expect the sisters to be younger, closer to Cordelia in age, but their old-hag look did help to portray their wickedness.  Edmund was very well portrayed.  Edgar, however, seemed a bit too frail to be the avenging bother.  Lear was portrayed quite well I thought, but he could've been taller.  He struck me as a little ball of fury.  The fool was easily my favorite character, and played his role well.  You could tell by the settings that this was a low-budget production, but they helped to divert the attention to the action, as did the plain costumes.  Overall, I enjoyed it and thought it was worth watching.",1132012800,,744,4.533834586466165
993660,2,6305223386,"From the appearance of this movie I can conclude that this is a first time experience for the director and most of the actors. The acting was either too much to stand or not enough to be able to understand. The actor that played King Lear was overplaying being insane. Edgar was very overdone. He was too much into his own world to make the audience understand his character. But I did like the performance of Goneril and Regan. I thought they were quite eviland exactly like i pictured. I did picture Cordelia to be prettier and not so ""Thriller"" like. As far as set design I thought it was incredibly poorly done. Costumes didn't seem realistic to the time period the play was supposed to take place in. Overall I thought it was i poor performance and a waste of time.",1132012800,,770,4.429577464788732
993661,2,6305223386,"This production can be summed up in one word: cheap. The sets were cheap, the costumes were cheap, and the acting was cheap. The setting was so overly simple as to cause distraction. It looked like someone had spilled a can of Tara Cota red paint all over everything. The costumes were no better. Some looked like they were just buttoned up robes while others looked straight out of Star Wars. All of the actors were so melodramatic that one could not focus on the lines, and some close-ups were so close it was disturbing. Overall, I did not enjoy the production.",1132012800,,564,4.53921568627451
993662,1,6305223386,"This movie really didn't interest me. The actors and actresses seem too dramatic and seem to be over-acting. They also did not appear how I imagined them to be after reading the book. I thought of them to be younger. The screaming and mumbling also distracted me. It made me want to pull out my book and follow along. The setting was dull and very cheap. The death scene at the end of the was kind of ackward. The evil sisters were in the room,ironically on a cart that had just enough room for two more bodies, and it rolled away easily. For the most part I did not like the movie.",1132012800,,582,4.205357142857143
993663,5,6305223386,"In an earlier edition of this review, I pleaded for a DVD release of this wonderful ""Lear"" ...and here it is! THANKS to PBS for this! It's one of my favorites!!",1128816000,,160,4.193548387096774
993664,2,6305223386,"The casting director should have spared us the bow to diversity and political correctness when a hispanic was cast as France and a negro as Burgundy. Set design and costume sacrificed tradition and historical representation to economy and off-beat originality. The costumes resemble those of Star Wars. The Fool, instead of being youthful, agile and entertaining, is fat, old and dumpy. The most entertaining thing about the fool is Lear referring to the grizzled 70 year-old as ""boy"". Holms as Lear can't hold a candle to Lawrence Oliver. Holms plays every scene with the same, monotonous, high level of intensity, like a manic Lear. He is unable to play Lear as a likeable, sympathetic character, in any scene. During the scene in which Lear's heart is supposed to break when Cordelia fails to declare her love with sufficient eloquence, Holms' Lear only comes accross as manic, obsessed and neurotic. Even with its poor film quality, Sir Lawrence Oliver's production is the best.",1123113600,18,982,5.067901234567901
993665,5,6305223386,"Lear is a play, one of several by Shakespeare, always completely owned and dominated by its lead. Ian Holm is one of those extraordinary actors who can bring tremendous depth and texture to even the shallowest things: witness his work in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and, from an acting standpoint, the tremendously underrated science fiction film ""The Fifth Element."" I can safely say that Holm's presence in any film is enough to get me to see it and I can't say that about any other contemporary actor. He is always a total joy and after many years it's wonderful to see him finally achieving the stature over here that he deserves.

Needless to say, the mere idea of Holm doing Lear is brilliant. Good news is this production scores high marks across the board and lacks the at-times labored self-consciousness of the highly regarded Lear production featuring Olivier (The play can only bear the weight of one old King). Holm's portrayal of Lear's possible senility is not as overt and inevitable, he is more shown as a man who, at the peak of his power, uses that power to deny his responsibility for anything. He wants to be treated like a king without being burdened as a king. Making him out to simply be a senile old fool makes too much of a victim of him, especially to modern audiences. This king is old enough to have reached the end of his ambitions but not the end of his responsibilities--I believe that may be the core point of the play. Shakespeare needed Lear to be an old man because the idea of a younger man surrendering power probably would have seemed improbable, almost laughable, to his audiences without the introduction of a complexifying plot device, an external reason for the king to give up the throne. He'd also be handing power over to inappropriately younger heirs. It would then be an entirely different play.

The Bard may also be saying that senility is sometimes the result of abrogation or denial (to us--broadly--even from an external source) of responsibilities: old age shouldn't imply  second childhood but if responsibility is taken away that's all that is left to any adult. In many ways, given our careless and insensitive treatment of age and experience in this culture--a culture sadly lacking in respect for our own wise old men and women--many of Lear's true messages may, in fact, be more than a bit alien for us if the play is presented wrongly. It could be why we tend to--incorrectly perhaps--overplay the senility card.

It's a subtle balancing act for any actor and Holm does a near perfect job of it. What some portray as senility, Holm shows rightly as the confusion of an individual accustomed to having his own way who no longer gets his own way and cannot for the life of him grasp why. Taken this way, the play has spectacular relevance for contemporary audiences, and may actually be about the most currently relevant of Shakespeare's plays. Think of the juvenile antics of the Tyco executives, of Donald Trump, of most of Hollywood, of the last several Presidential administrations. Will there someday be a Lear in the Oval Office wondering why the world has marginalized his or her nation and economy; why simply waving a flag and being the USA in name only ultimately means absolutely nothing?",1118966400,27,3255,4.755752212389381
993666,5,6305223386,"Though I love the plays of William Shakespeare, I have never been a fan of King Lear. Watching has always been too depressing for me. Even when it is well acted, it leaves me feeling progressively worse. This production has made me revise my opinion.

The story of King Lear is the story of an aging king. He decides to go into a sort of retirement and divide his kingdom between his three daughers. The catch is that first, he wants each of the girls to explain how much she loves him. The two older daughters are fullsome in their praise even if their motives are purely mercenary. The youngest daughter, however is different. SHe refuses to play the game. She is genuine in her love but refuses to engage in the one upmanship. As a result, her infuriated father disinherits her completely. All that follows results from this first act. The king becomes a figure of contempt and the older daughters squabble for a bigger and bigger prize. The result is a civil war and tragedy for all.

As in of of the Bard's plays, there are numerous substories. Most of them here invo;ve backstabbing and the alienation of friends and family. King Lear acts in anything but a regal fashion and his actions get progressively worse. You want to storm out onto the stage and beat some sense into him.

The title character is played here in a very refreshing and energetic fashion. This only serves to accentuate the slide into senility and childish behavior. The other roles are well done too.

This is a Masterpiece Theater adaptation for television. It does not have all of the lavish production values of a Kenneth Branagh film but that in no way detracts from a first class performance.

This Lear is a must for Shakespeare fans and is quite good enough for a general audience as well.",1116633600,35,1774,4.583596214511041
993667,5,6305223386,"Ian Holm is a great actor who really hasn't had a chance to really shine for American audiences.  Until now.  He's been a busy actor (most recently and notably in THE LORD OF THE RINGS films), and he may have other great roles I just haven't seen yet, but this has become my favorite performance from him.

After seeing his coolness in ALIEN, his Polonius in the Mel Gibson HAMLET, and his deep grief in THE SWEET HEREAFTER, I was blown away by Holm's KING LEAR.

The rest of the cast is really first-rate and their actions and expressions, along with effective direction, really bring the play to life.

Thank God these successful stage versions find their way onto video and DVD.  It would be a shame to have only great reviews left for the ages!

I haven't seen Olivier's LEAR but now I will seek it out, just to see how that version plays.

But I may already have my favorite.",1105574400,7,880,4.388888888888889
993668,5,6305223386,"Now a celebrity, courtesy of Bilbo Baggins (the keepcase to this King Lear DVD bills him as ""of the Lord of the Rings""), Ian Holm was a great actor long before he was Bilbo.  On this DVD he delivers a Lear on a par with the twentieth century's greatest, including Olivier's.  But the excellence of this version results not just from one bravura performance, but from an intelligently conceived approach to the play, seamlessly executed by a competent, superbly chosen cast.  Of innovative productions there is no end, but what a rarity, and what a joy, when innovation comes across as deeply authentic, rooted in the text and the humanity of the play, as if the new take had always been there, concealed in the text, waiting for centuries to be discovered.  One can argue whether Lear should be presented as a ""psychological"" drama of broken family relationships, and I have mixed feelings about the approach; but if, as our leading Shakespeare critic maintains, Shakespeare ""invented"" our understanding of human nature, then surely this approach should be tried.  And it works to perfection here.  Goneril and Regan, the ""bad daughters,"" evolve into monsters of pure evil, but along the way we see, via some remarkable facial expressions that play particularly well on the small screen, flashes of the agonizing pain and hurt that their overbearing father has inflicted on them.  This is true also of Cordelia, the ""good"" daughter; all these daughters are visibly tormented in the presence of their father, though Cordelia overcomes her past through love and forgiveness.  What keeps this from being the greatest Lear on video is that the text is heavily abridged.  Those who know the play will have trouble escaping the occasional feeling that they are trapped in a ""60 Second Lear"" from Tom Stoppard or the Reduced Shakespeare Company. The greatest of Shakespeare's lines remain, but how much greater they are when they emerge from his larger linguistic context.  At points the cutting even confuses the plot.  One gets no hint from this version that the ""bedlam"" Edgar is only feigning madness; for awhile you would think he's actually gone bonkers.",1096588800,65,2153,4.9860335195530725
993669,5,6305223386,"Considering the fact that the characters in this 'King Lear' are played by some very well-known actors and actresses in England, I was a little worried at first that it would be spoilt as I had seen them playing several  other roles on television. However, the acting, especially Ian Holm as Lear  and Barbara Flynn and Amanda Redman as Goneril and Regan respectively, is  superb, and you can really allow yourself to be 'swept away' with this  production. The only real criticism is that Edgar may be viewed as a little  too 'soppy' and gullible, and Edmund as being almost 'caricature-like'. The  red sets reflect the general tone of the play very accurately, and the fact  that it is adapted for television means that there is the bonus of having  the storm scenes outside, as opposed to still being inside as is the case  with a few productions. Certain parts of the original dialogue are cut, but  although this may be confusing if you don't know the play well, the  omissions do not affect the overall power of the play. This, along with the  Paul Scofield and Laurence Olivier versions, and Jonathan Miller's 1980  film, is one of the best 'King Lear' adaptations around. Each has it's own  individual strengths, but this version is definitely worth watching.",961804800,17,1266,4.774193548387097

I was able to grasp the television remote in my nearly nerveless hands and lifted my heavy, heavy arm up, struggling to press the STOP button with my thumb. And hallelujah, it was a miracle!

  The acting in this movie isn't dreadful, but it isn't all that great either. The biggest problem lies in the boredom that sets in as the viewers are subjected to the minimalist stagecraft and costuming. I'm all for directors to present Shakespeare's plays in innovative ways, but oh my word, what I wouldn't have given for a traditional ruff! A doublet! A stomacher, a codpiece or a petticoat! Anything to relieve the boredom of plain grey costumes (some of which looked like belted chenille bathrobes) and that orangey room. It looked like the entire film was shot from the inside of a cantaloupe.
  I know that the minimal scenery and costumes were meant to force the viewers' attention onto the characters, but it just didn't work. First of all, the scenery can do so much to provide context for the story line. Eventually, we did get to go outside in the storm, which was fairly well done, and then at some point we switched from the orange room to a grey room, but it wasn't enough. And obviously, the problem with costuming the actors so similarly is that it's hard to tell them apart, especially when the majority of them are older men with beards. I kept getting Albany and Cornwall mixed up. Gloucester and Kent were also hard to tell apart. Edgar (good guy) and Edmund (bad guy) were thoughtfully identified in white and black, respectively. Oswald and Edmund, however, were both in black and kept morphing into one another in a manner more reminiscent of The Matrix than the Bard.
  And then we get to the part where the actors could be terribly hard to understand. The fool, in particular, was unintelligible. Occasionally, the actors either barked out their lines or mewled them like tiny kittens, both of which made comprehension difficult.
  So, my friends, I turned off the movie. My students and I had a wonderfully animated class discussion on why costuming and stagecraft are so important -- they help us see the characters and they provide context to the play. We talked about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grigori-Kozintsev-s-King-Lear/dp/B000K2Q7H8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grigori Kozintsev's King Lear</a>&nbsp;and why it was so much better, despite the fact that it was shot in black and white AND in Russian (we read the subtitles). It ended up being a really wonderful session, despite the fact that this film is a terrible dog that I will never make my future students watch. After all, it nearly killed this set.

7885613,5,6305223386,"Since I am not an expert but a student of the works of Shakespeare I will only address the subject of the fool. The allowed fool and King Lear's dialouge shows the difference between the ""Allowed Fool"" and a ""Natural Fool"" very well. For example-I recently had the opportunity to see a theater production of ""King Lear"" at a Minnesota University and King Lear's fool was depicted as deformed and had a serious stutter which in Shakespeare's era would indicate a ""Natural Fool"" and the banter between Lear and his fool was itself ""deformed."" Back in Elizabethan times people enjoyed ""bear baiting, amusement at the expense of the dissabled which included using the developmentally dissabled as ""Natural Fools,"" while the deaf and the blind who were not treated well at all and were used as entertainement. An ""Allowed Fool"" was usually an advisor to the King and was schooled in latin and Greek as well as the sciences which is why this addaptation is one of my top ""King Lear"" productions- . The fool is brilliant and quick. To sum up my stance I must write that the Fool is crucial to King Lear as a character and also as his advisor which this production demonstrates.",1341532800,,1170,4.684466019417476

7885616,4,6305223386,"When I read that Lear would be played by Ian Holm, I was shocked.

Ian Holm???????????  That tiny man who always plays mousy nebbishes?

Bilbo Baggins????

Well, I am happy to report I was wrong.

Somehow, Holm manages to appear 7 feet tall and has ferocity and bluster to burn.

He is wonderful: he has fury, terrifying rage, delicacy, mordancy, sadness, waiflike pitifulness.  All the things Lear should have.

The other actors are good-to-great, too.

The only bad thing about this production is the sets.  It is essentially a filmed play, so the sets are usually a red-draped room with a table.

After all the lavish sets for Shakespeare by Branagh et al., I guess I got spoiled.

However, the acting and direction are thrilling.",1201132800,2,733,4.776
