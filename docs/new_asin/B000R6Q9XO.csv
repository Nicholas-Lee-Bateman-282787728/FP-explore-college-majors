He does not realize movies need more than just a pretty face. Yes, the girls are young and beautiful however he jumps around so quickly that one is not allowed to really enjoy their beauty. The movie itself is just a collection of senseless vignettes presented in rapid fire. I will say the best part of this DVD is the picture on the DVD jacket.",1364601600,,517,4.56989247311828
