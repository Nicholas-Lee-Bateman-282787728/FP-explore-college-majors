3796710,5,B001U5JNFC,This DVD is a must read for every American citizen.  It truely shows the foundation on which this country was founded.  It also shows the so-called historians' who dare teach there isn't any reason for God in politics.,1344297600,3,218,4.7105263157894735
3796711,5,B001U5JNFC,"A great video but the exposed corruption is but ""the tip of the iceberg."" The downgrade exposed in this documentary didn't happen because ""Christians"" failed to get into politics and/or become more militant(as the video partly implies). The lack of involvement is a symptom, not the root cause.

The root problem is the average American ""Christian"" has not been ""Christian"" for a very long time. The world got a strong foothold in our churches a long time ago and by the 1960's the fruit of this infiltration began to ripen. The Bible makes it perfectly clear how a nation is to be changed for the better (2 Chronicles 7:14). Once 2 Chronicles 7:14 is obeyed then we may start talking about being involved in government for the purpose of turning the nation back to sound thinking.

But in the final analysis, God is the One Who heals a nation. The one criticism I have of this film is that it seems to place too much emphasis on the assumed abilities of mere man (saved persons). This is a topical problem seen many times in our so-called ""Christian"" movies. The emphasis is usually on human emotions and human effort. When professing believers take this stance, they are no better than the lost (often much worse).

I'm thankful for this work but the root issue really is the lack of godliness in the professing Church
(2 Timothy 3:1-5). God's absolutely hates mere religious form. He hates it even more than outright wickedness.",1314921600,,1431,4.716
3796712,1,B001U5JNFC,"This was actually PAINFUL to watch! It's billed as a historical documentary, but it strays far away from actual documented history and engages in historic revisionism and outright LIES about George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and other founding fathers of the United States of America.

Upon further research it turns out the director does not have any background in history. David Barton CLAIMS to be a historian, however his ""higher education"" consists only of a Bachelor of Arts degree in religious education from Oral Roberts University. He has no academic qualifications in history whatsoever.

Barton has been described, by Arlen Specter (among others), as being a pseudohistorian, and his work has been criticised by REAL historians including Richard V. Pierard.",1312761600,10,770,5.46218487394958

3796723,5,B001U5JNFC,"David Barton's ""America's Godly heritage"" is an excellent exposition of the founding fathers faith in God and the founding of the country on their faith in God.

Quite rightly, the DVD focuses on obvious and incontrovertible proof that the founders were Christians and founded the country on Christian principles. It is an excellent counter to the out-and-out lies peddled by cultural-Marxists and atheists. Have you ever wondered why the ""secular"" government which demanded a ""separation of church and state"" would create the post of CHAPLAIN for both houses of Congress as their first order of official business? Isn't that strange?

The lies promulgated by the evil, cultural-Marxist left are successfully slapped down in this DVD. This is the true history of America, not the one fabricated out of whole cloth by the lying, leftist academia and infotainment media. This is an excellent DVD and should be viewed by anyone wanting to know the TRUE history of the founders and the founding.",1396137600,,991,5.149068322981367
3796724,5,B001U5JNFC,"Thank you, Mr. Barton, for bringing to light this very pressing issue in our society today.  Mr. Barton presents his material in an insightful way with meekness and gentleness.  After watching this video, you will find yourself talking with others at the coffee shop or other places where people gather regarding the topics on this video.",1391212800,,338,5.017857142857143
3796725,5,B001U5JNFC,"This DVD, ""America's Godly Heritage"", is an excellent counterpoint to prevailing dogma proclaiming a non-existent ""separation of church and state"" and shows that Christianity, the Bible and Christian beliefs and principles were foundational to both American government and culture.

David Barton takes the viewer on a guided tour of many of the physical places of American liberty and the spiritual underpinnings of both our Founding Fathers and the political system they bequeathed to their posterity. Mr. Barton displays his familiarity with not only the attitudes and beliefs of the founders, but also the documents, speeches, acts and legal decisions over a period of centuries. He conclusively shows that America is indeed a Christian nation and that court decisions of the last fifty or so years stand the original intent of the Founders on it's head.

Mr. Barton quotes directly from the early documents, and the public and private correspondence of our Founders. He shows conclusively that every court decision up to the post-WWII courts laden with ultra-leftists consistently upheld the concept of America as a Christian nation and that the US government was founded on Christian morality.

The video shows so many opinions, writings, speeches and actions of the US government and courts that universally state that America is a Christian nation that the last several generations stand in stark contrast to most of the nation's history. there is no doubt that contemporary attitudes of both government and courts is the work of leftist activists without even the thinnest shred of legal precedence to fall back on.

This is an excellent and well-argued production for the right-thinking American and equips the viewer to contend with the fallacious ""separation of church and state"" argument. I recommend this DVD with five stars.",1389657600,,1838,5.327586206896552

3796728,1,B001U5JNFC,"Barton's book Jefferson lies was Voted ""the least credible history book in print and cancelled by one publisher. Here is another book lacking.

David Barton (born 1954) is an American evangelical Christian minister, conservative activist, and author. He founded WallBuilders, a Texas-based organization which promotes the view that it is a ""myth"" that the US Constitution insists on separation of church and state. Barton is the former vice chair of the Republican Party of Texas. He has been described as a Christian nationalist and ""one of the foremost Christian revisionist historians""; much of his work is devoted to advancing the idea, based upon research that many historians describe as flawed, that the United States was founded as an explicitly Christian nation.
 Barton collects early American documents, and his official biography describes him as ""an expert in historical and constitutional issues"". Barton holds no formal credentials in history or law, and scholars dispute the accuracy and integrity of his assertions about history, accusing him of practicing misleading historical revisionism, ""pseudoscholarship"" and spreading ""outright falsehoods"".according to the New York Times, ""many professional historians dismiss Mr. Barton, whose academic degree is in Christian Education from Oral Roberts University, as a biased amateur who cherry-picks quotes from history and the Bible.""[ Barton's 2012 book The Jefferson Lies was voted ""the least credible history book in print"" by the users of the History News Network website. The book's publisher, the Christian publishing house Thomas Nelson, disavowed the book and withdrew it from sale. A senior executive said that Thomas Nelson could not stand by the book because ""basic truths just were not there.""
A 2005 Time magazine article entitled ""The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals"" called Barton ""a major voice in the debate over church-state separation"" who, despite the fact that ""many historians dismiss his thinking... [is] a hero to millions--including some powerful politicians."" Barton has appeared on television and radio programs, including those of former Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and Glenn Beck. Beck has praised Barton as ""the Library of Congress in shoes"". In September 2013, POLITICO reported that he has returned to the political arena and is advising state legislators on how to fight the Common Core academic standards promoted by the Obama administration.
Barton is a former Vice Chairman of the Texas Republican Party and has acted as a political consultant to the Republican National Committee on outreach to evangelicals.
 He serves on the Board of Advisors of the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools. This curriculum contains direct quotations from Barton's books, recommends the resources published by WallBuilders, and advocates showing that group's video, Foundations of American Government, at the beginning of the course.
Barton serves on the Board of Advisors of the Providence Foundation. In an article discussing Barton, The Nation described the Providence Foundation as ""a Christian Reconstructionist group that promotes the idea that biblical law should be instituted in America.""
Barton, in his book The Myth of Separation, states his belief that Christians were the ones who were intended to hold public office and that Jews and members of other sects were not. According to Skipp Porteous of the Massachusetts-based Institute for First Amendment Studies, Barton was listed in promotional literature as a ""new and special speaker"" at a 1991 summer retreat in Colorado sponsored by Scriptures for America, a far-right Christian Identity ministry headed by Pastor Pete Peters, which has been linked to neo-Nazi groups. Barton's assistant Kit Marshall said in 1993 that Barton was previously unaware of the anti-Semitic and racist views of these groups. In September 2011, Barton sued two former Texas State Board of Education candidates for posting a video on YouTube that stated that he was ""known for speaking at white supremacist rallies"".
Barton is a lecturer for Glenn Beck's online Beck University.
The Jefferson Lies withdrawn from publication
In 2012, Barton's New York Times best-seller[  The Jefferson Lies was voted ""the least credible history book in print"" by the users of the History News Network website.[ A group of ten conservative Christian professors reviewed the work and formed a negative view of its claims, reporting that Barton has misstated facts about Jefferson.  In August 2012, Christian publisher
The Texas Monthly noted in 2006  that Barton has denied saying that in his famous letter to Danbury Baptists ""Jefferson referred to the wall of separation between church and state as 'one-directional'--that is, it was meant to restrain government from infringing on the church's domain but not the other way around. There is no such language in the letter."" The article goes on to say that this denial is contradicted by a 1990 version of Barton's video America's Godly Heritage in which Barton states:
On January 1, 1802, Jefferson wrote to that group of Danbury Baptists, and in this letter, he assured them--he said the First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between church and state, he said, but that wall is a one-directional wall. It keeps the government from running the church, but it makes sure that Christian principles will always stay in government.
Barton's legitimacy was reported to be growing in 2006, due largely to his first non-self-published work, a 2003 article in the Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics and Public Policy, (Volume XVII Issue No. 2, 2003, p. 399), a ""rather tame survey"" on Jefferson's writings about the First Amendment.[1]
Thomas Nelson withdrew the book from publication and stopped production, announcing that they had ""lost confidence in the book's details"" and ""learned that there were some historical details included in the book that were not adequately supported."" Glenn Beck announced that his Mercury Ink imprint would issue a new edition of the book,[ for issuing once the 17,000 remaining copies that Barton bought of the Thomas Nelson edition had been soldwork and formed a negative view of its claims, reporting that Barton has misstated facts about Jefferson.
