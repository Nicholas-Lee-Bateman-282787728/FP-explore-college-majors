502372,5,6302730015,"This is the second time I bought this movie -- the first one was borrowed and never returned.  It tells you how much I enjoyed the story to purchase it again.  The contrast between two sisters -- one who has been in America since she was very young and the other sister who survived being in a concentration camp during WWII is very poignant.  Their values seem quite different at first because their experiences were so different, but they both had to deal with anti-Semitism, and in the end, they become real family members.",1358553600,,526,4.574468085106383
502373,5,6302730015,"I have never been able to understand why this wonderful movie is not offered on DVD--it is an astonishing story that dramatizes a seldom covered subject in films, that of the aftermath of World War II and its impact on survivors and their families.  It would be worth seeing alone for the performances of Kyra Sedgewick and Amanda Plummer, two of my favorite actresses and the fact that the teleplay of the film is a vast improvement over the play that it is based on in my opinion.  It also, if I remember correctly, won quite a few awards the year it was released.  Given the current (and long overdue) popularity of the fabulous Ms. Sedgewick in TNT's ""The Closer"", it surprises me that Hallmark has made no move to release this on dvd at long last.  I have carefully preserved my video copy for years and if you have to watch it that way, it is well worth tracking one down rather than miss this tremendous drama.  Accolades all around.",1351296000,,940,4.473684210526316

502375,3,6302730015,"No one really survives the Holocaust;in some way or another a person,nomatter how they escaped that onslaught are altered forever in their relationships to themselves and others;that is the central theme of this 1992 EMMY AWARD WINNER for outstanding movie of the year. A young Kyra Sedgwick is shown to already be the fine actress that fifteen years later will earn her GOLDEN GLOBES.The story is definitely light fare as far as Holocaust related movies go. Good companion films to MISS ROSE WHITE would be A CALL TO REMEMBER and AN AMERICAN RHAPSODY which both explore the post-war dilemna of family and assimilation. For a foreign film that is similar I suggest MENDEL (Norway).",1173312000,5,681,4.982456140350878
502376,4,6302730015,I really enjoyed this film because it showed the other side of a holocaust survivor and her family.  There aren't many films made about what happened after the war to survivors of the holocaust.  This film tells a good story about how a family deals with the issue. Hallmark always makes warm and touching movies that everyone can enjoy.,996278400,14,337,4.694915254237288

Viktor Frankl's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-s-Search-for-Meaning/dp/080701429X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man's Search for Meaning</a>&nbsp;around the age of 9 or 10, I have had a very deep interest (some family members have called it ""an obsession"") in the Holocaust. I've read tons of books about the Holocaust, and seen tons of Holocaust-related films. But very few (if any!) of them were about (or included) the impact of that genocide, years or decades later, on those who lived through the Holocaust, and/or the families of those who didn't -- which is the aspect that interests me the most about the Holocaust, how the survivors (especially all those who lost their ENTIRE families) managed, especially in the immediate aftermath, but also years or decades later.

Unfortunately, there aren't very many good books or movies (or at least that I've been able to find) on THAT topic, though the 1997 TV movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Call-to-Remember/dp/0783223366/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Call to Remember</a>&nbsp;is a GREAT one, and one of my favorites.

From the blurb on the back of the box:

Rayzel Weiss (Kyra Sedgwick) and her father (Maximillian Schell) fled Poland before Hitler invaded, but her mother and sister were less fortunate. Fifteen years later, Rayzel has left her past behind. She has a new life and a new name -- Rose White. Happy and successful in her Manhattan apartment and her upscale department store job, Rose keeps her tragic past hidden from her friends -- and her own heart. But Rose's carefully constructed world begins to crumble when her long-lost sister, (Amanda Plummer in an Emmy-winning performance) a concentration camp survivor, comes to America to stay with her. With Lucia's arrival comes painful memories that haunt their reunion........and a shocking revelation that will challenge everything Rose believes and all that she hopes to be. Now Rose must face the ghosts of the past to find her dreams for the future in this unforgettable Emmy-winning Best Drama about acceptance, forgiveness and family ties.

 POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!! 

Basically,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Rose-White/dp/6302730015/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Rose White</a>&nbsp;is about Rayzel Weiss, who outside of her family (or at least her father who does not initially know) she goes by the name Rose White, a young woman who, as a young 3 or 4 year old child, was separated (literally torn from her arms!) from her mother and elder sister, and taken to the United States by her father sometime in the mid-to-late 1930s. Rayzel's mother and sister had been planning to join them in America -- unfortunately after Hitler's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 and the subsequent outbreak of World War II, they got trapped in Europe and as observant Jews (though, even Jewish people who were NOT observant -- and rather, totally assimilated, were targeted as well) were persecuted by the Nazis.

Meanwhile, Rayzel was growing up in New York City, as an almost totally assimilated American, without even a trace of a European accent. As a young woman she has a job as a buyer for an upscale department store, and has her own spacious apartment in Manhattan. The only real wrinkle in her life is her relationship with her distant and very traditional/old-fashioned father, who doesn't know who she really is -- including (as I mentioned above) the name that she goes by everywhere outside of her family home. There is a lot of tension between Rayzel and her father that is simmering just below the surface -- the source of which is not immediately/initially clear to the viewer. Moreover, even that tenuous relationship with Rayzel and her father is put to the test, when the family gets word that Rayzel's older sister, Lucia (though, if I recall correctly, the TV captions spelled it as Lusia) survived the Holocaust, and is emigrating to the United States -- and Rayzel's father decides basically unilaterally, that when Lusia arrives, that it will be Rayzel who picks her up from ship's port, and that Lusia will move into Rayzel's apartment. To say that Rayzel is reluctant to take in her long-lost sister, a concentration-camp survivor, would probably be an understatement. Although Rayzel objects, saying that she is too busy, that its been so many years since she's seen Lusia and other excuses, her father is adamant that Lusia will live with Rayzel for the forseeable future. When Lusia arrives from war-ravaged Europe, she very traumatized (naturally!) suffering from nightmares that leave her screaming & crying at night. She is also harboring an explosive secret that could completely tear apart the ""relationship"" between Rayzel and their father for good. After that bombshell comes out, everything is thrown into a tailspin and like the blurb on the back this VHS video box says, ""Rose must face the ghosts of the past to find her dreams for the future"".

Although I usually like most Holocaust films I've seen and even though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Rose-White/dp/6302730015/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Rose White</a>&nbsp;is an Emmy-winning film, I didn't really like it. Aside from the fact that it didn't really ""grab me"", like other films (especially those dealing with the Holocaust -- like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miracle-At-Midnight/dp/B0000DZTIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miracle At Midnight</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-Is-Beautiful/dp/B0033AI48Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life Is Beautiful</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Frank-The-Whole-Story/dp/B00005LC5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Frank - The Whole Story</a>&nbsp;and many others) do, I also didn't really like Kyra Sedgwick's character of Rayzel Weiss/Rose White, except towards the end of the film. I could NOT stand the way that Rayzel treats (acts towards) her sister, who literally survived HELL in the Nazi concentration camps/death camps. Maybe its just me, but Rayzel seems to be very insensitive to Lusia's pain, and the continuing trauma (maybe even PTSD) she's going through -- and in my opinion, Rayzel just comes across as a very selfish & self-centered person throughout much of the movie, concerned more about her own career and ambitions climbing up the retail/corporate ladder than her sister's suffering..

Basically I didn't care that much for this movie. I don't know why, because its NOT a badly-made movie, per s (the Emmy win for Best Drama is an example of that) but there was just something about this movie, for me. Maybe its that I don't really like Kyra Sedgwick's acting, at least in this movie, and whatever else I remember seeing her in so far (which is why I've never seen more than one episode -- maybe not even an ENTIRE episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Closer/dp/B000ENC6QY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Closer</a>&nbsp;the TV series she starred in, even though I usually like police & legal dramas)

Based on the other reviewers good ratings of this movie, I may be (and probably am) in the minority of those who didn't really enjoy it. But I didn't. Like I've said, its NOT a bad movie, I just think that there are better movies out there about the Holocaust -- maybe not necessarily about the aftermath/impact of the Holocaust years or decades later which seem to be few & far-between, though&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Call-to-Remember/dp/0783223366/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Call to Remember</a>&nbsp;is definitely a GREAT movie on that subject.

As for THIS movie, its just okay!

7830220,5,6302730015,"This Hallmark Hall of Fame movie dealt with a difficult subject very well, and gave good insight into what refugees often suffer through in coming to a new country.  We appreciated the good acting and honest portrayal of the struggles the characters experienced, not only in the new country but within the family.  This story brings forth understanding and compassion from its viewers.",1376265600,,385,5.095238095238095
7830221,5,6302730015,"The way this movie blossoms onscreen it simply takes you by the nose, awakening many memories of family flavors past and present. Though its unthinkable to compare the challenges the holocaust put on surviving families, in this engaging movie you see the familiar faces of family dealing with shame and guilt, anger and forgiveness.  The heavier the burden the stronger the will to resolve, and in ""Miss Rose White"" it seems everyone is strongly forced to reolve issues they've carried inside so long.

The acting is incredible.  As I always mention about great movies, the real juicy parts are hidden in the silent pauses in between character exchanges.  Amanda Plummer and Maxmillian Schell are as believable in their hurt and anger as any, and Kyra Sedgwick gives a very convincing performance discovering family secrets. And we are there with her every step of the way.  This is a movie of transformation, so be ready to confront any family issues you might be carrying around. Again, I don't think any of our family issues today can compare to a jewish family's reuniting after the holocaust, but as families we all share in what it means to confront the pains a family shares within its own circle. Shame never takes a holiday!",1364428800,2,1233,4.852380952380952
