6916626,5,B00R8N1BTG,I love it! Some nights I have difficulty relaxing.  I reclined in bed just listening to the rain and before I knew it I was sound asleep.,1425254400,3,137,4.074074074074074

6916690,4,B00R8N1BTG,"Four RAINY Stars. From the Window Channel, this video of a Midnight Thunderstorm is from their Sleep Channel. It is 9 hours of a video showing an unchanging scene of wind-blown leaves and rain drops, with the sound of falling rain, rolling thunder, and lightning. The intensity of the steady rain increases and decreases. The scene is ultra dark to help falling to sleep, and the leaves are in focus. Very Definitely Recommended. Four HELPFUL Stars. (The Window Channel. Not Rated but G-level. Color. HD. CC. Time-9 hours/43 seconds.)",1500076800,,534,5.01123595505618
6916691,2,B00R8N1BTG,The rain part was good but the thunder was waking me up.  I think the Binaural beats off Youtube and repeat works better for sleeping since it is all a gradual up and down level that seems to block out noises and quiet your mind better.,1491436800,,236,4.130434782608695
6916692,4,B00R8N1BTG,This video is in my top 3 for sleeping. I love that it is over. Is very visually appealing with the rain falling on the leaves. I'm also glad that it last 9 hours instead of 8. For me there's only one drawback and that is the difference in volume between the rainfall and thunder. When I place the volume at a level where I can hear the rain fall the thunder startles me and wakes me. So I turn the volume down to where the Thunder doesn't wake me but then I can't hear the rainfall.  If there was a such a difference in volume this would be my go to for sleep.,1488412800,,561,3.9210526315789473
6916693,5,B00R8N1BTG,I like it. So soothing and calming. You will sleep like a baby. I do close the top on my case and rotate the speaker toward the bed.,1486857600,,132,3.75

6916724,5,B00R8N1BTG,"I sometimes have difficulty falling asleep and found that listening to thunderstorm recordings allows the ruminating to quiet down enough for me to fall asleep. This product is perfect! The sound recording is 9 hours which enables me to fall back asleep should I wake up in the middle of the night. It blocks out any background noise (i.e. noises outside, dogs chewing on toys, etc) and puts me in a relaxed state. I appreciate that the picture is dark and removes blue light as to not interfere with melatonin production. It's the best recording I've found to promote deep and restful sleep!",1486166400,,592,4.757281553398058

6916791,5,B00R8N1BTG,"I've tried a few of these relaxation videos to try to fall asleep and this one is my favorite. I really like how dark the screen is with this one, because I often sleep with facing the television, and don't want a bright screen shining in my face. I find the rain and the light thunder very relaxing. I usually turn it on and then read until I get sleepy and it usually doesn't take long to make me sleepy. It's also 9 hours so you don't have to worry about it running out overnight. The Sleepwell Channel also has some other nice videos if rain isn't your thing, but this one works best for me.",1485129600,,595,4.137931034482759

6916796,4,B00R8N1BTG,"I love to fall asleep to this video.  The ultra dark feature is wonderful because I can't sleep unless my room is really dark.  And the fact that it lasts 9 hours is perfect because it will run all night.  Other videos that only last for a few hours tend to wake me up when they shut off.  My only criticism (and it's a very minor complaint) is that I wish the volume level was a little more consistent.  There are times when the sound gets louder and other times when it's so quiet I can barely hear it.  Other than that, it's a great sleep app.",1484870400,,546,4.05607476635514

Living somewhere where it rains often, leaves would be my last choice to record rain over. Something that doesn't have such a (for lack of a better term atm) splat, not my prime choice, but of all the rain options this would be my first choice.

Evening rain is great if you need white noise in the background or something to focus on to help you fall asleep.  If this captured the sounds from my home during a loud thunderstorm I would have given it a 5 star rating.  But, that's a project for me some day in the future.

One recommendation I""d offer is to have more thunder...  The combination of the repeated thunder and heavy rain are a fantastic combination to end your day and ease you into a restful night...

I took off one star because I was trying to use it for sleep and did not find the rainstorm very relaxing; in fact, I ended up turning it off within minutes.  The rainstorm was so strong it kept me awake rather than getting me drowsy.  For me, a more gentle rainstorm works better.  I'm sure it comes down to personal taste.  I did like the low light aspect.",1454889600,4,438,4.228915662650603

The rains rotare back and forth between soft to hard, mixed w a little thunder from time to time, and seems to lull me to sleep.

The video length is about an hour and I honestly don't think I've ever made it to the end.  I'm usually out in 15 to 30 minutes.

His wife my sister has cancer and does not rest great at all, so when he got the free trial I played these thunderstorms for her. She is more relaxed when it rains so she is loving these. Thank you so very much for these great shows, It allows her at least some peace thru the nite hours for a relaxed body.",1526342400,,415,3.8941176470588235

8694599,3,B00R8N1BTG,"The rain sounds are very good, and the steady increase in rain volume is great. And i like the roof/metallic sounds too. However, many times the decrease in rain intensity sounds more like someone simply turned down the volume knob, not a decrease in the amount or size of rain drops. Who knows, maybe it's a real full 9-hour rain storm, but I think it must be due to some track splicing methods or they just got lazy and didn't put as much effort into the volume decreases. For whatever reason, that wakes me up. I started noticing it at about 5:30 into the playback, so I re-listened and noted at 5:30:20 through 5:30:35 is one volume drop, and that's too fast but still relatively slow compared to the ones at 5:36:55, 5:42:15, 5:47:35, 5:52:54, and others. Way too much interruption. Two nights I couldn't get close to 8 hours of sleep.",1520380800,,840,4.532894736842105

8694602,5,B00R8N1BTG,This has become my new go to routine if I want to get at least a few hours of solid sleep.  I love the rise and fall of the storms intensity.  It's very soothing and the ultra dark screen doesn't distract you from being lulled to sleep by the rainfall.,1519689600,,252,4.02
8694603,5,B00R8N1BTG,"Perfect. I had such an amazing night's rest. It's excellent.
It mimics a real storm, and as far as I can tell it's unpredictable (just like real rain)

Please try and ignore these picky critics who are complaining about the pace and variable intensity of the rain. Really?",1513987200,,272,4.666666666666667
