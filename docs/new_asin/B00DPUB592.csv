5846775,5,B00DPUB592,A very funny British TV show. If you work in IT especially dealing with end users you will enjoy this show. Each season has six episodes for a total of twenty four episodes plus a final one hour episode that aired a few years after the series ended. This new complete series DVD set will be released on November 1st 2016. Enjoy!,1472083200,10,328,4.306451612903226
5846776,3,B00DPUB592,"Keep in mind that this is from the UK. And if you are from the US it won't work in your dvd player/Xbox one/PS4. Dvd's from Europe and the UK have a different region code that stops them from playing in any dvd player sold in the US. Now, your pc can still play them, but pretty much just your dvd player.

If you don't know what I'm talking about and maybe your thinking that your dvd player is made in china and it will work. The answer is most likely not, there are some blu-ray/dvd players that can play any region code out there, but its pretty rare. The whole point of the region codes is to prevent people from buying US movies over in Europe or else where before it comes over to Europe and vice versa.

So, if you are a US buyer just remember that this will only work on your computer.

Other than that the dvd's were great, shipped fast and were cheap no other problems so far.",1432166400,5,887,4.115606936416185

5846778,5,B00DPUB592,"Take two hopeless I.T. nerds (one a slob and one a bespectacled social misfit), and add a lying people expert. That's the setup for ""The IT Crowd,"" a fun little workplace sitcom that sits on the other end of the comedy spectrum from ""The Office"" -- in particular, hardcore farce. The series is crammed full of pure weirdness and mild surreality, starting with simple workplace comedies and then piling on the weird.

As the story begins, Jen (Katherine Parkinson) is hired by the deranged CEO Denholm, whom she has told that she knows plenty about computers. Unfortunately, he doesn't plan to have her working on the levels that are full of ""lots of sexy people, not doing much work, and having affairs."" So he sends her down to the I.T. department, a filthy basement occupied only with ""standard nerds"" -- an embittered slob named Roy (Chris O'Dowd) and socially oblivious Moss (Richard Ayoade).

Despite the fact that they keep the company from imploding, nobody appreciates them (""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""). Initially the guys loathe Jen and vice versa, but gradually they start to appreciate one another. And as the series goes on, the trio of awkward weirdos has to deal with countless strange occurrences, problems, disasters and the occasional criminal undertaking.

""The IT Crowd: Complete Series"" has a few bumps in the road (""The Haunting of Bill Crouse"" way overextends some of its jokes) but is overall a pretty solid sitcom -- think a more farcical version of ""The Office"" with a dash of ""The Mighty Boosh."" It even has Noel Fielding as the supremely freaky goth that lives down in the basement like a vampire (mostly in the first two seasons).

And it's got some great running jokes like Douglas Reynholm's idiocy (""I don't think I've ever looked in this drawer... WOW, a gun!"") and the idiots who call IT because their computers are unplugged. But each episode has its own running gags: toe-deforming shoes, iPhones, bottom-kissing, ""manly"" behavior, flaming bras, erotic calendars and Douglas offending the top five major world religions. And the dialogue is a big oozing bundle of hilarity (""My trouser hams are not for sale sir!"").

The core three actors are all brilliant at their very different characters -- Parkinson (who looks like a slapstickier version of Gillian Anderson) is wonderful as a pathological liar and girly-girl with the worst office on Earth. O'Dowd is deliciously sloppy and resentful about the way the rest of the employees treat him (a necessary evil), and Ayoade is gloriously weird (""Weird is all I've got! That and my sweet style!"") and clueless about real life.

It has a couple weak episodes, but ""The IT Crowd: Complete Series"" is one of the funniest shows in many a year -- especially if you walk on the dork side. Ich bin ein nerd!",1374019200,3,2801,4.861635220125786

We hate that it doesn't have more episodes, but applaud the producer saying ""We've done as much as we can do with this idea, so we're stopping while we're ahead.""

Recently buying and seeing the wrap up/finale episode made me think of the series again.  As soon as I did I told my wife ""We're getting that!"".

This is typical British humor but we North Americans can easily enjoy it as well.  It situational humor about a couple outcast guys, Roy and Moss, and Jen, their clueless IT boss.  Great laughs abound.

5846834,5,B00DPUB592,"Back in the Eighties, I was working on a story for the morning edition when my computer froze up.
I asked a couple of other reporters if they had any idea what I should do to get it working again but they had no clue. Their only advice: Call the IT department.
I did, stressing the fact that because I was on deadline speed was of the essence.
Right.
Waste of breath, really, that bit about being in a hurry.
About 30 minutes later a chubby young man wearing glasses and a Starfleet Academy T-shirt wandered over, sat down at my desk, fiddled with the keyboard a bit, and got my computer working. He stood, gave me a pitying glance, and then wandered off without ever saying anything to me.
That was my first encounter with IT but over the course of my career as a journalist I had many others with the men and women who work in information technology. With rare exception, they followed the same pattern: Something would go wrong with my computer, usually when I was on deadline. I'd call IT and, eventually, someone would show up and get it working again. The pitying glance was always a feature of these encounters.
As a result, although I wondered just who they were, I never really got to know anyone who worked in information technology. When, therefore, I saw ""The IT Crowd"" I bought it because I was - I suppose - curious about the odd life forms that spend their days fixing computers.
So glad I did because this British comedy is genuinely funny with sharp writing, very fine acting, and some very pointed comments about life in a giant corporation.
The series revolves around two men who are hidden away in the basement of the mega-corporation they work for and their new boss, a woman who actually knows nothing about computers and how to fix them. Chris O'Dowd and Richard Ayoade are brilliant as the IT crew and Katherine Parkinson  is hilarious as their ambitious boss who really doesn't know the difference between a keyboard and a mouse. Matt Berry as the mentally unstable, sexually adventurous head of the corporation is equally funny.
What makes the show so interesting to me, however, is the fact that beneath the broad humor are some underlying truths about life in the corporate world. Sexual harassment, bosses who know little or nothing about their departments, toxic work environments, and general incompetence are all dealt with in this series, albeit with sharply worded humor.
This DVD pack also includes some very clever animations and featurettes that give viewers some insight into the making of the series.
I highly recommend it.",1482451200,7,2562,4.693333333333333

The cast is excellent, great casting of the really quirky characters. It is the story of an IT department at a large firm in London. The writers and ensemble cast have a way of making every little detail of daily life hilarious.

5846841,4,B00DPUB592,"The IT Crowd: The Complete Series is a British TV series that takes place at Reynholm Industries, a hugely profitable company whose exact function is never made clear. The companys Information Technology Department, located in the basement, is staffed by bitter slacker Roy (Chris ODowd, Bridesmaids), super-nerd Moss (Richard Ayoade, The Watch), and technologically clueless middle manager Jen (Katherine Parkinson, Pirate Radio).

Among the bizarre situations the IT crew find themselves in are befriending a cannibal, designing the ultimate bra, and creating a charity calendar of topless nerds. As they toil to solve the most mundane technical issues and navigate the corporate landscape, they must also troubleshoot their unusual personal lives.

The IT Crowd has well developed central characters and doesnt go after wisecracks and rapid-fire jokes. The humor builds with situations set up for their eventual comic pay-off. Not joke-y in terms of gags-per-minute, it  satisfies in how the comedy derives from oddball situations and the personalities of the main characters. Though the setting is a tech company, those who have worked in any type of office environment will recognize many of the foibles and situations.

The characters are funny and likable. The first episode  which should grab us immediately  is not that sharp, but subsequent episodes hit their stride and set the tone as a clever deadpan geek-centered comedy.

The 5-disc DVD set contains all four seasons of the series. Special features include commentary with writer/director Graham Lineman on select episodes, deleted scenes, featurettes, outtakes, interview with Graham Lineman, original titles sequence, and the music video Kalypso by Sweet Billy Pilgrim, featuring Katherine Parkinson.",1478304000,10,1767,5.620300751879699

I have looked for this for years and SHOULD HAVE looked at Amazon in the first place. Live and learn I guess! As with British television and films, not everything is neatly tied- up conveniently at the end of the show nor is it the over the top American style of comedy but the fun part is that in the bonuses included, many people not only identify with the characters, they actually know friends, family, co-workers. or identify themselves just like the characters in real life and have been through similar mishaps and been treated the same way in real life.

As the show progresses from season 1, the characters pulled me in and I couldn't help but like the character's growth progress and realization that they need each other and have more in common than they first thought along with the bonding that goes with long-term or life-long friends (very rare).
