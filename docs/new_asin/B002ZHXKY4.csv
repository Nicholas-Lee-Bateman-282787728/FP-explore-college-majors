8385076,5,B002ZHXKY4,"I am intending to buy a RED One and specifically bought this in order to check out the camera and do some research.

I need to watch it again in detail, but even from a brief viewing, I can tell that it is very well structured in it's approach, both for potential owners and advanced users.

The parts that I found really useful were the coverage of the key features of the camera and seeing whether or not it was capable of doing what I wanted (it is).  Being a low budget filmmaker, I also wanted to find out what equipment I could ""skimp"" on.  For instance, if I could get away with buying a small cheapo hi-def TV to use as a monitor instead of the expensive RED monitors - at this shooting level, $3,000 bucks saved on not buying the RED monitor can be put to excellent use in other areas:  for instance, purchasing a quality mixer to route your mic's through, which you will need if you want good sound on the RED, which is geared more to professional line-level inputs (a good thing, but could catch out the people who are used to the mic-direct-to-camcorder route and setting levels on camera).  You'll get superb sound from RED if you follow the professional route and make sure that those 4 channels of 48Khz, 24 bit uncompressed audio have a quality feed to start with.  Don't skimp on your sound equipment.

Jay's DVD showed me that I could use the cheapo TV for framing, monitoring etc. yet still maintain good control over exposure through the RGB level graphs which form part of the display setup.  Best of all, I now know that I can use the HDMI output from the RED to the ""cheapo"" HD tv, via a $10 HDMI connector.  More savings that can be spent on other areas of production.  This is all stuff that you need to know in advance and the DVD is extremely helpful in this respect.

Possibly one of the biggest issues that Jay raised is the problem of infra-red light contamination (and Jay's DVD is the first time I had ever heard about it, so hat's off for the heads up Jay!).  This occurs when you are shooting in bright sunlit conditions and don't stop down the lens, but use ND filters instead (so you can continue to use wide open apertures to maintain shallow depth of field).  Normal ND filters will cut visible light but not infra-red.  The RED sensor is also sensitive to infra-red, so some weird colour shifts start happening when your ND filtration is very high.  The simple solution of course is infra-red cutting ND filters.  Jay shows all the work-arounds for a variety of niggles.  But it's nice to know about these upfront and not be caught unawares.  As an aside and to be fair, it's not only the RED camera that suffers with this problem.  When Clint Eastwood was shooting ""Invictus"" in South Africa, they had problems with certain film stocks shifting colour thanks to infra-red contamination because of overly bright sunlit scenes and ND filtration.

I guess this is one of the things that gave me a lot of respect for Jay's DVD.  He has a great deal of respect and ""love"" for the RED camera, but is also not afraid of warning you of the minor problem areas.  2 thumbs up and highly recommended",1267228800,,3128,4.439579684763573

8385078,5,B002ZHXKY4,"I found Jay's RED101 DVD extremely helpful before my first hands-on experience with the RED ONE.  The menu run through was excellent, and I have gone back to the DVD for reference many times.

Jay is a great presenter who makes the DVD not just informative, but entertaining as well!  Highly recommended!",1265760000,,304,4.8076923076923075
8385079,5,B002ZHXKY4,"I purchased this product and walked away from it knowing, not only more about the Red camera, but about other third party products that I can use with the camera that I didn't know existed (i.e vector scopes, element technica products, Cool lights products, and many many more).  You won't regret owning this DVD.",1265760000,,313,4.796296296296297
8385080,5,B002ZHXKY4,"This video is a great and comprehensive resource for the Red owner or future owner, who needs to get a handle on the many configurations and capabilities of the camera.  It is especially useful for students, who are learning the Red system for the first time.",1265760000,,259,4.630434782608695
8385081,5,B002ZHXKY4,"RED101 DVD is well executed, and very informative, not only on the use of the camera it self, but in the various accessories, some of which absolutely indispensable, Jay did a great job on putting together this DVD, and it is a pleasure to watch, not the usual boring and repetitive nonsense, really something that in my honest opinion no one that uses and or intend to use a RED ONE camera system should go with out, Highly Recommended!!

8385082,5,B002ZHXKY4,"I recommend this DVD highly for anyone seeking an overview of the RED One camera, how it works, ideas for camera setups, styles of use, etc. In my opinion this DVD is much better than getting a book about RED. The DVD is entertaining, informative, and has good production values. Whether you're a longtime pro seeking to get up to speed on RED One, or a a new working in the industry, this DVD will fast-track your learning curve.
