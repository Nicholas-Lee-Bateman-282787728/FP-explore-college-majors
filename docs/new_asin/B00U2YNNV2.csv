7028342,5,B00U2YNNV2,"Dylan and the folk uprising

By

Rob Jones

Bob Dylan needs no introduction and his place as one of the primary players in the pantheon of pop is assured. However, when it comes to the tale of this immense icon: Where and when did it all start? Who were the influences that sparked the man born Robert Allen Zimmerman in to action? What was the path that the young folk artist followed?
These integral questions and many more come to light on the well-researched and diligently-presented DVD entitled Bob Dylan: Roads Rapidly Changing (In and out of the folk revival 1961-1965).  The viewer is taken right back to well before Dylan made his monumental stamp upon contemporary culture-and, we are then transported in the era where his star is rising to a level where he is now a source of change.
Dylan took his early love of the likes of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger from his Minneapolis roots and sought to soak up the bright lights and lively arts of New York City. Dylan ate up music, literature and the atmosphere around him and he gradually started to form his own style that over a course of time became a shape-shifting stance that caused a lot of furore when he decided to develop the acoustic scene and electrify this tradition to give his words and ways a more contemporary aural feel.
The recording is awash with expert analysis and archive footage to add to which there is an overwhelming feeling of a yesteryear transition period coming back to life. This product is well worth a punt whether you are a Dylan devotee, folk fan or just an aural aficionado.",1468108800,,1569,4.5928571428571425

7028346,5,B00U2YNNV2,"This is a really great DVD, it tells the story through footage and photographs of Dylan, the folkies and NY city itself from the time of the folk boom of the early 60s. Getting Village Voices Robert Chritagu as one of the speakers was a inspired move as was including so many musicians; Maria Mulduar and John Cohen take us right back to where it all happened. But there are lots of other important people to the story included here, too .
There are lots of great lines about Dylan. Christagus astonishingly better than anyone elseand a great singera great singer is a dozen different modes is probably my favourite. Oh, and the story it tells, I never explained  it is of Dylans meteoric rise to the top of the folk and protest worlds that he was to quickly leave and move on to fresher, even deeper pastures. As he was to sing more than a decade later, in another context, it all went by so fast; it really did  roads rapidly changed indeed and this DVD takes you through that journey in fine style.",1441843200,6,1001,4.405405405405405

7028348,5,B00U2YNNV2,"I was amazed by this documentary.  I am a longtime Dylan fan and have been disappointed more than once by one of those ""Independent Review"" DVD's, and not just concerning Dylan.  But I had a bunch of Amazon points just burning a hole in my pocket so I put some chips down and picked it up.  I was stunned at how good this is....excellent interviews, hi fidelity clips from early Dylan albums, and great historical context.  If you are a Dylan fan, this is a must buy.  A comprehensive and balanced examination of Dylan's folk years, trust me when I tell you you will not regret purchasing it.",1434758400,11,592,4.444444444444445

7028350,5,B00U2YNNV2,"This is one a large series of documentaries that the British DVD company Chrome Dreams has been issuing on all the facets of Bob Dylans career. There must be almost 10 of these, each covering a different period in his 60+ year career. They are not in chronological order and this one goes back to the beginning of his time in New York City. Like the others in this series, there are some quirky things you need to deal with  lots of performance footage whose sound has been deleted (rights issue?) and new acoustic guitar instrumentals are used for the sound track. Thats not to say that you won't hear Dylan singing. There are excerpts from TV shows and quite a bit from the Newport Folk Festival by Murray Lerner. (Lerner is credited for those).

Like the other films in the series there is a narration which provides the general facts and then its up to the interviewees to fill in the pieces. Many are the same music journalists (British authors and critics, Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis and the Village Voices Robert Christgau) but there are significant new comments from singers Maria Muldaur, Eric Andersen, Martin Carthy, and former Fugs member Peter Stampfel. Tom Paxton appears here but that was taken (hopefully licensed) from the great Greenwich Village documentary by Laura Archibald.

To put things in perspective we have a new interview with Izzy Young (founder of The Folklore Center) who produced Dylans first major concert  in Charter Hall at Carnegie Hall where only 53 people filled the 300 available seats.) And the critics also discuss Peter Paul & Mary, Phil Ochs and Joan Baez. As the subtitle says this is about In & Out of the Folk Rev8ival 1961-1965 and stops just before Dylan went electric at Newport.

Im a Dylan fan but not a completest and I found the 121-minute film worth watching. In fact  because of my interest in his folk years, I liked this better than others.

The DVD does have a few bonuses. There is a four-minute deleted interview with Eric Anders plus text bios of the Interviewees.

I think most Dylan and those interested in the New York City scene will find this worth watching. Yes, it's got it's quirky moments of matching images to the soundtrack, but it is one of the few in-depth analyses of Dylan's career at that point in time.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

This movie had about 4 commentators who were there with Dylan during 1961-1965,,,,and add some expertise commentary.  Personally, I remember exactly when Dylan went ""electric""....and it was great !!  The snobby Folk purists wanted to put their little ""Bobby Dylan"" into a neat little compartment, and tried to make sure he NEVER changed !  But Dylan had other thoughts...(thank God !)  - - - - All and all, this was a GREAT 2-hour movie/ documentary about Robert Zimmerman, who started off playing the role of the Great Depression Woody Guthrie, and ended up becoming a world-wide Pop Culture icon !  - - - Great piece !

8704260,5,B00U2YNNV2,"This is an excellent critical and historical walk through Dylan's early career.  Those who prefer light narration and mostly music performance would be advised to look elsewhere (for example the Newport Folk Festival DVD set).  For those of us who love an in-depth discussion and celebration of the contributions he made to music and songwriting during this period, this is a great gift, with insightful commentary by some of the best music reviewers and documentarians in the business.  The series is continued by three other DVD sets: After The Crash (1966-1978), Both Ends of the Rainbow (1978-1989), and The Never Ending Narrative (1990-2006), all of which are well worth the time, depending on the part of Dylan's career you are most interested in.  I love it all, and have seen all of them.  My only beef is that the two most famous albums of his career, Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, are not covered by this or any of the other DVD sets.  How could they leave out that crucial period of post-Newport '65 through the '66 World Tour???  Anyone know of a documentary by this set of reviewers/commentators that covers that?",1473552000,4,1139,4.84020618556701
