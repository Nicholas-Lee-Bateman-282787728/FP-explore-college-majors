1858086,1,B00008QSAV,"After watching this DVD disk I found that it was difficult to study man's part. The man on disk dressed on so that the color of his dress and background almost same. You have to pay much attention to separate where his legs are and how he moves. On the other hand, the lady's part has good contrast.",1112227200,27,299,4.172413793103448
1858087,3,B00008QSAV,"There are no frills with this DVD, but Teresa takes a simple, easy to follow approach.  This DVD is EXTREMELY WELL INDEXED!  Whether you think her approach is best or not, it is so easy to go back and forth between the lessons, since everything is indexed as a separate chapter.  Contrast this to DVDs that make you go to the beginning of the Tango chapter, then forward through 12 minutes of dancing...  Sometimes I found the DVD too simple and would have liked more depth.  Overall, easy to follow, easy to use.  ...just gotta work on that music...",1085011200,47,550,4.505050505050505
1858088,3,B00008QSAV,"Video tapes are good source for learning, especially if live instruction is not available. Ms Mason and her partner Randolph are excellent smooth dancers. The problem for those wishing to learn is that the man's steps are shown separately in detail, but not the woman's. Also the man is usually filmed from front or side and not from the back making it difficult to follow. We did learn to dance, and quite well, but only after numerous stops and rewinds. The Webb's tapes are a classier production and much easier to follow but their dancing is not as polished. Except perhaps in their swing series which appears to be more of Webb's style.",987897600,93,641,4.68141592920354

1858117,5,B00008QSAV,"This step by step dance DVD guides you through all the phases of a particular dance, then combines the moves so you see how the finished product should look.

1858123,4,B00008QSAV,"We were quite satisfied with this video.  The verbals are clear and it is easy to follow the steps.  The music is not the best, but that isn't what we bought it for.  There are a few issues with camera angles and the woman's steps aren't laid out quite as clearly as the mens.

We watched the whole thing twice and came away from it with an all new ability and confidence on the dance floor.  I would recommend this video to my friends.",1295395200,3,436,4.142857142857143

1858126,3,B00008QSAV,"This work offers the bare basic patterns(box step, underarm turn..rock step)instruction in an interchangeable styling-free approach to the listed dances.

Costume and set background colors (black on black) make it difficult, if not impossible for the visual learner to discern the man's (leg and footwork patterns)parts easily.

Auditory learners will find The Verbal cues are well articulated and easy to hear.

This production might offer a suplemental social dance resource (practice companion)for the student enrolled in a community social dance class.",1209772800,12,556,5.839506172839506

1858128,3,B00008QSAV,"As a rank beginner in ballroom dancer, I found this DVD to be instructive and clear.  The narration is concise and the demonstrations are well done. The instructional level is very basic, but that is ok for someone just starting.  This DVD could serve as useful supplement to ""real"" dancing lessons, and it would make a good review reference for the sometime dancer.",1117065600,35,366,4.7936507936507935

7986309,5,B00008QSAV,"This DVD introduces ballroom dancing to complete beginners. The DVD has about 30 tracks on the main menu. The early lessons teach basic steps common to all ballroom dances. They show steps for both dance partners. Other introductory topics include listening to the dance music.
The later lessons cover six of the most popular dances in detail. I found the instructions easy to follow, but naturally, mastering the dances requires practice. I think that most people who are reasonably well coordinated can learn ballroom dancing basics from this DVD.",1494115200,,549,5.179775280898877

Checked this DVD out from the library,  with the intention to order from Amazon,  if we liked it.  Absolutely not.  While the man's part is shown,  the woman's part is most often not.  This  is supposed to be beginning lessons.  How  is the woman supposed to learn, if her part is not illustrated?  If you want to learn Ballroom,  look elsewhere.",1487980800,,441,4.571428571428571
