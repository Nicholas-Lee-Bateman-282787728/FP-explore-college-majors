This lady is an original act that sits in a category of one and does not pander to scenes and trends. Her aural admirers consist of diverse artists such as John Lydon, Tricky, David Gilmour and Peter Gabriel. Enigmatic, extraordinary and otherworldly-the plaudits justifiably roll on and on
The worthy recipient of this praise is Kate Bush who still defies the odds with her unique and uncompromising stance. A recipe of aural, visual, theatrical and choreographic ingredients has made this English eccentric an inspiring and influential force.
Her arrival forged the way for individuality and s 70s and 80s back catalogue can still stand the test of time. Kate Bush: A life of Surprises is a fine 2 DVD set that explores the life and times of a phenomenal female force. The 180 minute package takes the viewer from a start as an aspiring songstress onward to a post millennium juncture. The product places a heavy concentration on the period between The Kick Inside and Aerial before the Hounds of Love album is also dissected. There are archive interviews, interesting contributions plus rare footage-and, in a world where Bush material is less rather than more this treat is an essential purchase.",1457308800,,1238,4.9423076923076925
8446579,2,B004XAKO90,"As previously stated in other comments,this is a re-issue of 2 previous documentaries. I didn't know this when I pre-ordered it. I feel ripped off a bit. Though, the DVD's are great, if you don't own them already. The "" Hounds of Love"" analysis is especially well-done. I agree with the other reviewer...that in the wake of the slight re-emergence of Kate Bush, I expected something extra than a re-hash...however, this is not authorized by Kate Bush...so it is what it is. Oh well....",1311897600,7,485,4.785714285714286
8446580,3,B004XAKO90,"Judge Brett Cullum, DVDVerdict.com--MVD brings us a documentary they call Kate Bush: A Life Of Surprises which is a two DVD set which explores the singer through the eyes of people who barely know her yet have studied her work intensely. The talking head panel is made up of well read if unrecognizable faces from the world of music. Contributors to the documentary include radio personality Paul Gambaccini, magazine contributor Lucy O'Brien, composer Morris Pert, music journalist Phil Sutcliffe, writer Nigel Williamson, and various members of Kate's band and studio musicians. None of this is authorized by Kate Bush who only appears via old interview clips and in snippets they show of her videos. The two discs feature 90 minute programs, yet this is essentially the same story just cut in two different ways. The narration is the same and we just get different bits of interviews with the same panelists and some odds and ends from performances and music videos. The frustrating bit in all of this comes from realizing you will never see a full performance or a video in its entirety. You just get a taste of everything, a tease of what should be the focus.

8446581,2,B004XAKO90,"To be quick, this 2-DVD set is a new packaging of the previously released unauthorized documentaries ""Kate Bush: Under review"" and ""Hounds of LOve: A Classsic Album under Review"".  If you have those discs, you don't need this one, unless it's for the attractive cover photo.  (Kate's always had a lovely ""Irish girl next door"" quality.) While the Hounds of Love  disc is the more interesting of the two, the first disc I found tiresome and plodding.  What both discs offer is a lot of talking heads and  static pictures interspersed with some nice stills and brief clips from official videos and vintage TV interviews (often in substandard quality -- not taken from master sources, I suspect).  At least the Hounds disc brings in a musicologist and one of Kate's drummers to enliven things and examines the old films that inspired some of that album's songs and imagery.

It's a shame this repackaging doesn't offer anything new; I had hoped for better things in the wake of Kate's sudden surge of activity, but this DVD set looks only to be an attempt to make more new money from old product.",1309910400,27,1093,4.721052631578948
