2613194,5,B000GI3RWO,"This is one of the better HotLicks videos (I own over 20). Tommy speaks into the camera, engages the 'audience', and really makes it seem like a private lesson.

The best part about this lesson is getting Tommy's perspective/philosophy on playing bass and being part of a band. This is a guy who could easily fill 45 minutes with bass-lines and say 'This is stuff I did with Stevie Ray' and wrap it up. Instead he talks about his influences, his gear, and what being a great bass player means to him.

If you want to play guitar, bass, or drums, and aspire to be part of a 'band' (and not just an individual musician), then this DVD has something to offer.",1214179200,13,656,4.368852459016393
2613195,5,B000GI3RWO,"If you are interested in learning blues bass this is the DVD for you hands down! Tommy shows you the the most commonly used blues bass lines. He also covers walking bass lines and provides some great info on bass playing theory. In this DVD he also show and explains some of the bass lines he played with Stevie, such as Mary had a little lamb, Pride and joy and Texas flood. when you watch this you will come to realize Tommy's bass playing goes much deeper than what he played with Stevie, and he is undoubtedly one of the best blues bassist's since Willie Dixon.",1171670400,17,565,4.339622641509434

8132448,2,B000GI3RWO,"If you want to just watch a very sleepy Tommy play 20 exercises with almost no explanation of what he's doing, this is the CD for you. If you want to learn how to construct a bass line, what lead tones are, what the blues progression is and how to move around it, you're out of luck. In short, if you already know how to play blues and just want to learn some of Tommy's patterns, I guess this might come in handy.",1397001600,3,414,4.0
8132449,4,B000GI3RWO,"I rented this on Netflix but of course it didn't have the tab booklet. I liked it enough to buy the dvd so I could get the tab and work at my own pace. This dvd is good for my level of knowledge and experience, maybe beginning intermediate. I recommend it but it depends on what style you like.",1390867200,,294,4.0

8132451,5,B000GI3RWO,"Tommy Shannon is one of the great bass players of our time.  He doesn't just play a bassline, he is playing the songs.  Although he doesn't get in the way of the guitar or the rest of the band, he is definitely playing more than most bass players.  I love the way he also makes sure to thank the other musicians that came before us.",1355356800,,332,4.076923076923077
