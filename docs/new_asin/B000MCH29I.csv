Synopsis:

Take an opinion poll today in Andhra Pradesh (a southern state of india) to name the most selfless freedom fighter from the state, a significant number would recall the name Alluri Seetha Rama Raju instantly. But it's a shame that not many of us knew how ASR inspired the marginalized people in the Northern Circar region to fight for their basic rights untill we watched this eponymously titled movie.

This movie is produced by the hero of this film. His name is Krishna. He used to be considered as the 'Super Star' of the Telugu film Industry. He acted more than 325 movies as hero in Telugu language. Produced by Superstar Krishna himself on his flagship Padmalaya, this high budget movie chronicles the events that led to the Rampa rebellion. Inspired by the ideologies of the ""extremists"" or ""radicals"" in the freedom movement like 'Lal, Bal, Pal', Ajith Singh, Balagangadhara Pillay and others, Alluri Seetha Rama Raju (Superstar) unites the meak and forms a rebellion that eventually fights the feared Assam Riffles wing of the British military for over a year in what has now come to be known as the ""Rampa Rebellion"".

Since all wars usually turn out to be number games, the rebellion is of no match to the might of the British Army and to minimize the casualties at this end, ASR surrenders himself to the enemy. The movie ends with Rutherford (Jaggayya) executing the noble warrior without the procedural military trial.

Artists performances: Qualified critics have written a lot about Superstar Krishna's performance in this movie. Despite these raving reviews, it is interesting to note that his acting was not appreciated by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. Those were the days when the jury opined that commercial success and formal recongitions were two mutually exclusive elements.

Considering the fact that the jury has started recognizing performances in commercially successful movies also, Superstar Krishna would surely have been a leading contender for one, had this movie released in present times. Jagayya, in another author backed role, closely matches the histrionics of Superstar in the movie. While Krishna rendered gravitas to the title role, Jagayya, with his suave enunciation of the English lines ""No Major Gudal, We must kill to rule and not rule to kill"", "" Mr. Gudal, You better talk less and work more"" brought in the necessary sophistication required for his role. Never before and never after him not even the illustrious Praan as Bussi in Taandrapaaparayudu has anyone performed these kinds of roles so consummately. It is also an absolute delight to watch so many distinguished actors and actresses trying to out perform each other in the movie. Interestingly, each of them gets a chance to show their credentials somewhere.

Songs: As the founding president of the Civil Liberties Union and an active member of ""Viplava Rachayathala Sangham"" (VIRASAM), Telugu poet Sri Sri played a prominent role in the evolution of leftist ideology in India. Hence, the song ""Telugu Veera Leevaraa"" which has lines like ""Tirugubaatu Cheyyaraaa, tharimi tharimi kottaraaa"" came naturally to him. Apart from this National award winning song, ASR also has another melodious song called ""Vasthaadu Naa Raaju ee rooju"" that testifies the wordsworthiness of Dr. C.Narayana Reddy.

Maharathi's dialogues: Tripurannei Maharadhi's dilogues are the best for this movie. with english sub titles, eventhough you can not enjoy the full essence of the dilogues, the dilogues in Telugu are the best.",1209427200,,4037,5.354889589905363
