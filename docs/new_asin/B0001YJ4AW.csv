2043209,5,B0001YJ4AW,"More of a pitching drill video, ""Pitching Drills & Techniques"" is long on the drills and a little short on the techniques.  However, this valuable tool for 7-12 year olds is a ""must have"" item for Little League parents and coaches who have kids that aspire to pitch and pitch well.  The producer of this video takes the approach that there are way too many theories on pitching, especially for young players, and that you are better off teaching them the basic fundamentals and instill different drills to make players aware of the different parts of their body that make up the pitching motion.  Some advanced drills like the ""Concentration Drill"" with one lefty and one righty batter standing in the batter's box together, is a sight to behold.  Tried it already and can see the potential positive results.  The program goes at a terrific pace and there is no boring parts to it.  Pitching analysis is addressed and done so in a clear consise manner.  I would have liked to see a bit more with this.  The producer also gives some very valuable tips toward the end about how to recognize if your pitcher is tired plus other bonuses. He is right on the money when he states: ""With Pitching, It Is Better To Have Youth Players Master 4 or 5 Techniques Than Be Confused By 20"".
Words most leagues and parents should live by.  All in all this is a real winner and leagues should make this part of their library.",1077235200,7,1408,4.533596837944664
2043210,1,B0001YJ4AW,"I have purchased somewhere between 10 to 15 different baseball video's and this one is really not worth the time or the money.

I guess if you knew nothing about pitching this video would give you some drills to work on, but you can get the same information for free on You Tube.

The kids they utilize for their drills have really bad form, which is not helpful to watch.  My 10 year old came in and started watching the video with me and asked if it was a joke.

There are some good video's out there, but this one is not it.",1257379200,,527,4.087378640776699

Youth players will be pitching ""downhill"" on the road to success!
A very good program!",1250985600,,156,5.28
2043213,5,B0001YJ4AW,One of the better pitching tutorials I've seen after purchasing numerous books and videos. Captures the importance of teaching youth players the proper techniques supplemented with some very good drills.,1246320000,,203,5.8
2043214,5,B0001YJ4AW,"This simple pitching program is perfect for Little League coaches covering the 8-12 year old kids. Dynamic drills with good explanations. Simply put, pitching is not just the throwing arm but the complete body and this video proves it!",1243728000,,235,5.051282051282051
2043215,5,B0001YJ4AW,"The essence of this program are the drills demonstrated to get youth players who want to be pitchers a full sense of the mechanics involved.  Most of the drills are relevant! Use of the legs and hips are addressed as far as the pitching motion. Many youth players refuse to recognize that complete body mechanics are just as important as arm mechanics. This program gives an excellent overview!  Like Marty Schupak's other sports videos, the production values are excellent! This video is a welcome addition for parents, coaches and Little Leagues. Ages 7-12 will get the most from this program.",1242691200,,595,4.94

Very good drills.  For first year coaches, this is a must!",1082160000,6,245,4.444444444444445
2043218,5,B0001YJ4AW,"This guy seems to get it right.  Most pitching pitching videos
I've seen have way too much talking and complicate an already complicated subject.  Heck, my son is 9 and I don't think he'll sign with the Padres.  So I'm not interested in a lot of the technical jargon.  This video has relative easy, simple pitching drills for players ages 8-12. Most of the  pitching drills can be used for older players with some adjustmnts.  He gives the drills names such as , ""Multiple Home Plate Drill"", ""Knee Drill"" and more. Paying close attention to the narrator, there are excellent subtle hints (""practice pitching against a wall with your eyes closed"") that youth coaches and parents will find useful.  He goes into a pitching anyalsis which is very good but could have used some more info.  My son and I have watched this a few times and it is enjoyable.  We went outside to do some of these drills and look forward to trying them with the team. The written hints at the end of the video should be mounted on every Little League dugout in America.",1077321600,11,1042,4.529411764705882
2043219,5,B0001YJ4AW,"Excellent teaching methods for youth baseball players who not only want to be pitchers but also helps develop the correct throwing motion for the whole team.

8018258,3,B0001YJ4AW,"A little dated video but has some of the very general and basic drills for a beginning coach... The drills are explained decently but some could use some more information on to what they correct and so on... For a more advanced coach - this video is not for you. There are multiple things that are wrong with the video... The kids in the video have tons of pitching/throwing flaws that appear to not be fixed or worked on - short arming, low arm positions, etc. They are not very athletic kids with poor mechanics. The long toss drill - don't do it this way - these kids are short arming and not stepping into their throws. There are many other flaws like low arm positions, feet together during the stretch position and so on... I wouldn't recommended this video to anyone that has some coaching experience. To a brand new person to baseball just looking for some drills - you can find just as much and better by using Google and You Tube and doing a little research.",1427241600,,968,4.41340782122905

8018261,1,B0001YJ4AW,"This was the most boring baseball instructional video i ever seen......the drill'S that they use,makes no sense to me at all,pitcher pitching with one foot on a chair,pitching with his feet crossed,etc. ARE YOU KIDDING ME.if you want to see how baseball should be played and instructed,watch the Tom Emanski video's or Cal and Billy Ripken video's these are the best video's i've seen. Believe me,i'm not Tommy Lasorda by all means,but dam i know some stuff about baseball,this video sucks,buy something else,this video put me to sleep. HONESTLY.",1316995200,2,546,5.146067415730337

8018263,4,B0001YJ4AW,"I never really paid attention to warm-ups but after viewing this program, the importance for
even young youth players to loosen up is convincing. The drills are easy to follow with good explanations.
Not as much technical stuff as I would like but over coaching in youth baseball is a problem.
This program excels in certain pitching theories. For instance, I agree that youth players should almost
exclusively pitch from the ""stretch"".  Coaches & baseball parents looking for useful pitching tips should
make this DVD part of their baseball library.",1288569600,,550,5.111111111111111

There is information in this program I have not seen anywhere else, including YouTube.

The kids utilized for the drills have really good form. My 12 year old came in and started watching the video with me and loved it!

There are some great video's out there, this is one of them!

8018265,4,B0001YJ4AW,"I've spend time and money purchasing pitching books and videos.
This ranks being in the top three along with pitching videos by Tom Emanski and Tom House.
This is by no means an in depth technique driven product for high school players and beyond.
It is however, for young players ages 8-12 who want to pitch, one of the most basic well explained drill
orientated products I have seen.  The producer is correct in his assumption that giving youth players too much
instruction is counterproductive. The basic wind up and delivery are explained and the drills giving players
practical knowledge using the whole body is important and detailed.
A good program that Little League coaches and parents need to make part of their resource catalog.
Recommended!

a typical parent coaching Little League will not understand them.
PITCHING DRILLS & TECHNIQUES make more sense than you realize once you try the drills.
We had two 11 year old pitchers and one 12 year old pitcher work on many of the drills
resulting in a lot success. If you are looking for a pitching video to teach
your son or player the knuckle curve or slider, then pass on this video.
If you are looking for some simple explanations and common sense approach,
this should be part of your resource library. A great program!",1258588800,,584,4.518867924528302
