3558520,5,B001EX9Z2Q,"Super Dave...a blast from the past.  He is a perfect blend of inane arrogance, stupidity, insulting slurs and hilarious stunts...none of which are taken to a vulgar extreme...except for the stunts.  It's impossible not to laugh...especially at his under-the-breath insults.  Just writing this has me laughing again!",1391990400,,315,5.659574468085107

3558522,5,B001EX9Z2Q,"I have not seen these in many years and was glad to find this. I was not even looking for this and came across this and said holy cow I forgot about super dave. I got this and have had many laughs at the silly stunts he pulls off. I am glad that we have this and then went and found best of bizarre vol 1 - 10. I remember how funny he was and now can watch it over and over. I like to watch funny stuff after working and having a bad day, these tend to make me forget how bad things are.",1383004800,,487,3.6476190476190475

3558527,5,B001EX9Z2Q,"Super Dave Osborne is, to me, the funniest character on film -- and it is not just because of his ridiculous stunt failures.  The humor is in his never-ending optimism about the outcome of his stunts, the qualifications of his setup men, his absolute and unmerited trust in their judgement, his constant faith that his stunt will truly be the single greatest stunt that YOU have ever seen, his voice -- a flat, dull monotone that conveys absolute (while probably misinformed) honesty and his pride in such things as his ""compound"" and his absurd uniform. I think Super Dave is a genius. Well, at least a genius at making me laugh -- over and over again as I watch this ridiculous DVD.  Maybe this will convince you to get this DVD:  I love it and my wife HATES it.",1334102400,6,764,4.482014388489208

8299901,3,B001EX9Z2Q,"I love Bob Einstein (aka Super Dave) and usually laugh out loud at this character. Here is a great collection of some of his best ""catastrophes.""
.
However, I believe that the very heart of this character's bits are best viewed once in a while rather than as a basket  filled to the brim with eventual mishaps. Mishaps that happen rarely are funny. Mishaps that happen over and over all at the same time is sort of like watching a great comic, slip on different banana peels over and over. This great character's high-octane stumbling needs a little bit of time between performances. You want to believe that he's finally figured out how to do it right.
.
If you have the discipline to watch only one or two at any sitting, you will be rewarded with some truly great and classic comic moments.",1417392000,2,793,4.506944444444445
