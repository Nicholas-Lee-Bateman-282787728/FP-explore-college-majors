5037715,4,B006Z510Y4,"I watched this miniseries and then bought the book and read it. I found the whole story a powerful exploration of love and war. I have one question though, does anyone know if this is the version that aired on BBC? Honestly, I want to buy it, but the PBS version cut some stuff out and I want the original version.",1335312000,5,314,4.163934426229508
5037716,5,B006Z510Y4,"I watched it on PBS I love any movies in this time era or earlier, their decent to watch, you don't have to worry about the language. I though it was a very good movie.

5037717,5,B006Z510Y4,"This WWI movie, with lush flashbacks to pre-war France, is alternately beautiful and horrifying.  The trenches in the France in 1916 are ghastly.  Intermingled are haunting and evocative images of a romance from before the war.  Acting is excellent.  Beautifully crafted movie.",1335139200,16,277,5.523809523809524
5037718,2,B006Z510Y4,"This was released in Europe in it's original widescreen format on Blu-Ray. It is going to be released here in a fullscreen format (1:33). Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because a lot of PBS watchers in the US still watch on their old format (4x3) TVs? Whatever the reason, it is crazy to release a Blu-Ray widescreen movie in a Blu-Ray fullscreen format in this day and age. But hey, we are backward in a lot of things. The Europeans had widescreen TV long before we did. So, don't waste your money on this one until they release it properly, if you want to watch it properly.",1334707200,17,575,4.333333333333333
5037719,5,B006Z510Y4,I love PBS Masterpiece movies...and this is by far one of the best. The acting was superb and the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. They should make more movies like this one!,1330732800,39,177,4.741935483870968
5037720,5,B006Z510Y4,"I just finished the book yesterday and can't get it out of my head. Was delighted to discover this adaptation. It's the first I've seen Eddie Redmayne in anything because apparently I live under a rock. Anyway, he was fantastic as Stephen, and I'll definitely go explore his other work now. Nice to see familiar faces among the supporting cast (namely, Clmence Posy, Richard Madden, and Matthew Goode). The book is achingly poignant and a haunting read. This adaptation absolutely does it justice. (I was actually quite pleased with the changes from the source material, to be honest.)",1516665600,2,585,4.979591836734694

I often wince at anachronisms in period dramas, but Birdsong is free of them. Or at least I haven't spotted any. I'm always engrossed in the story, and I've watched it several times.",1483488000,,419,4.5131578947368425

5037760,3,B006Z510Y4,"I should have paid better attention to the rating, but I guess I should have known that ""TV-MA"" meant that it would have some pretty graphic love scenes and nudity. To be honest, I really didn't get very far into it and finally turned it off after 2 sex scenes and then it began to show a character's breasts for a prolonged length of time. (not sure how long cause it was during that prolonged nudity that I turned it off.) I know that there are movies with nudity and  sex scenes, that is why we have ratings, I just should have known better, so that was my bad.
If the Mature rating doesn't bother you, I suppose I could recommend it. It seemed to have an interesting story line that I would have liked to continue.
For me personally, if I would have to turn it off when my kids walk into  the room, then I generally don't watch it; and this is definitely one that fits into that category.",1464912000,,892,4.2105263157894735
5037761,3,B006Z510Y4,"This series is not for the faint of heart when it comes to scenes of life in the trenches of war or graphic sexual themes and scenes. If the audience for this series is primarily well-read men who are interested in history with a side of romance, it hit the mark. For wider audiences, the in-your-face violence of the war scenes and dismal overall color palette (which reflects the mood very well) is probably much too dreary. The lead actors (Clemence Poesy and Eddie Redmayne) are easy on the eyes and both give stellar performances but this is not something I would ever wish to watch again.",1464825600,5,594,4.5607476635514015

It was very sad in places.
It showed what life was like in the trenches in W.W.1.

I have watched Birdsong when it first aired and a few times more. Redmayne is brilliant in this role, like every part he plays, and just breaks my heart throughout the series. Highly recommended.",1463184000,,343,4.931034482758621
5037777,5,B006Z510Y4,"I thought this was worthy of the ""Masterpiece"" brand.  Sure, if the typical Hollywood blockbuster is more your thing, you're going to find this slow going, but I for one did not mind the pacing at all, and liked the period ""feel"" of the piece.  Give me something like this over yet another stupid superhero sequel any day.  It conveys very well the human tragedy and futile stupidity that was World War I.  And I thought Joseph Mawle's portrayal of Jack Firebrace made for one of the most sympathetic and lovable supporting characters since Pat Morita played Mister Miyagi in the original ""Karate Kid"" movie.",1463097600,2,608,4.761904761904762

I can hardly wait for the next series of this well-written love story. This is a tissue alert so have a real big box of them. The actor Eddie Redmayne has such expressive eyes he doesn't have to say a thing for you  to know what he's thinking or feeling. He has had two oscar nominations for the movie about Stephen Hawkins and the lead in  the movie the Danish Girl. Please watch this on Amazon Prime.

Some people may be distracted by the vacillation between romance and war, but that was how it was done in the book.  I thought I would care more about the romance than the tales of war, but they are of a piece.  The romance informs the protagonist's emotional make up and therefore his approach to war.

5037844,5,B006Z510Y4,"Incredible short series. Just finished watching via amazon prime. Reddie Redmayne is (as always) brilliant. Clemence Poesy is lovely. The woman playing her sister was strong.
The plot lines were well told. Conflicts between characters felt real.
The romance was ardent beyond breath-taking.
 I was most fond of the character Jack (Joseph Mawle), a down-in-the dirt trench/tunnel digger. His beautiful eyes & the love he had for his son.....won't do spoilers but the series is worth watching to see this fine actor do an amazing job.
The flashbacks worked so well, a relief from the horrors of WWI, which resulted in over 17 million deaths. It was an horrific time. England lost most of its aristocratic young men, who had joined up so jubilantly, thinking it would be ""over by Christmas.""
I continue to be baffled that films like this, which are So intensely realistic, continue to be made & viewed yet still we march off to war, such a futile undertaking.
Jack's last words are so true: all that matters is to love & be loved.
I am a woman, a pacifist, my father served in WWII, my brother in Desert Storm, Iraq & Afghanistan. I wrote a paper on George S. Patton for a college history course, went to West Point, studied his letters. Even he thought that war (as of WWII) was becoming absolutely futile. He thought that the heads of state should have to fight in hand-to-hand combat, with the survivors being the leaders; leave all the young people alive & out of battlefields.

5037846,5,B006Z510Y4,"I first became aware of Eddie Redmayne in his role in 'The Theory if Everything'.  He was as magnificent in that as he was in this endeavor.  Another wartime story, it kept me riveted as I compared this couple to a modern-day Romeo and Juliet, of sorts.  Their characters  discover each other in peacetime, and  are thrown together by chance as the war plays out.  Injured numerous times, he keeps being reunited with Isabella, only to be torn from her again and again.  Finally it is too late for their romance to survive, even after the discovery of the one thing that would have bonded them forever.  The backdrop of the war was the perfect setting for this tragedy as the world struggled to survive as well.  Will there be a season 3?",1454716800,3,738,4.488721804511278

The main characters do not get developed so we don't care about them -- despite all the terrible things that happen to them.

5037904,2,B006Z510Y4,"Worth seeing once, but don't expect much.  It is disappointing to see opportunity squandered in this adaptation.  Characters were undeveloped caricatures exchanging smitten glances and silly, whispered clichs which fall flat.  I wanted to care about them, and I wanted to understand what caused her to ""be the only woman"" he had ever loved.  The relationships were hollow and superficial, the actors seem very self-aware, as if earnestness can overcome weak material.  However, the scenes of pre-war France, the costumes, the Western Front with the soldiers trying to stay alive...these were all very well done and fulfilling.  For history buffs, I think this series is worth watching once just to experience the battlefield scenes.  It very effectively depicts the wastefulness of war.

Poesy is good in a limited role, likewise Matthew Goode, whose role is unfortunately too limited. Not nearly as strong a story as Parade's End, which covers much of the same ground though the latter is more interested in English society and its peculiar traditions.",1435276800,2,440,4.802631578947368

5038061,3,B006Z510Y4,"This could have landed better than 3 stars if I were in a different mood, perhaps. As it was, it felt too slow and too empty to be anything more than a pretty picture. It feels as though the producer wanted to impress upon the viewer various moods and stark contrasts: the fullness of a scene vs. the emptiness inside, the aching of a heart vs. the horror of what's happening in war, life vs. death. Unfortunately, it was too subtle to work most of the time... or I just didn't care to work that hard.

The movie is long, yet it doesn't take the time to develop the people fully. It appears as though the main characters were wrapped up in youthful impulse fed by boredom rather than a lifelong love affair. The relationships between men in the trenches *could* have been very fulfilling, but we only get cursory glances at who they are. I am all for minimalism, but when you take too much away, you remove the structure that gives the space its meaning.

The film is visually lovely. It is well acted. It just doesn't fall together in a satisfying way. It's not because it didn't end the way I wanted it to (it was actually quite predictable). I think it was a matter of pacing. It's okay, but don't expect that it will become a favorite.",1426550400,,1239,4.359307359307359

The love scenes are less successful.  Clmence Posy makes exactly the same expression in all her scenes.  It's as if they shot 30 seconds of her face looking open and vaguely surprised and then just inserted that footage whenever they needed her character to appear throughout the rest of the movie.

I suspect Eddie Redmayne was given the same poor direction, but somehow, his character still shines through.  If the love scenes were removed from this, I would definitely watch it again.",1425513600,2,621,5.03921568627451

5038123,4,B006Z510Y4,"A powerful story.  Graphic (though not pornographic), passionate love-making, juxtaposed with graphic, gruesome wounds to British soldiers caught in the stupidity of World War I.  The flash-back technique of story-telling is very effective in (a) contrasting the lush and truly gorgeous countryside of pre-World War I France (the cinematography is breathtaking) with the surreal, horizon-to-horizon destruction of the land wrought by the belligerents during the First World War, and (b) revealing the evolution of Eddie Redmayne's character from a callow adulterer to hardened British infantry line officer.  Redmayne's character seems to have been afflicted with the ""1,000-yard stare"" from the moment of his initial encounter with Ms. Poesy's character as a guest in her husband's home (who could blame him?) and long before his first taste of trench warfare.  Clemence Poesy is unusually gorgeous in this film and is a natural for her role.  Special praises are due for the actors who played the British soldiers under Redmayne's command who were drafted to tunnel under the German lines.",1418947200,2,1091,5.470238095238095

Birdsong is 2 ""episodes"" which are two hours each.  With stunning cinematography, the bucolic French landscapes and the graphic brutality of WW1 battlefields  captured my attention even though the script dragged somewhat.  Historically interesting is the setting of the  underground tunnels which ""sewer rat"" soldiers dug under enemy lines. This is a  visually beautiful film and period piece.

The story is largely unoriginal and the dialogue sluggish or flat in many places.  This plot has been better served  and better acted in ""English Patient"", ""Atonement"",  Lusty young lovers , Stephan and Isabelle, enter into an illicit romance and struggle to keep love alive through the pressures of  immaturity, mis-communication, separation, and war.  I felt that the actual outcome of the lovers' affair was of less importance than how Stephan would use his memories to survive five years of  horror .

Perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of this production is the peculiar direction to the actors to stare for far too long at one another.  Also, not having read the novel from which it was adapted, I found the sequencing fairly confusing to follow and the ending scenes jagged and unclear.  One should not have to have read the primary source to encounter an adaptation...it should stand on its own as a cohesive entity.  This said, I found the battle scenes to be moving and very powerful, thanks in great part to the fine actors who surrounded the main character.  Had this not been a Masterpiece production, I would surely have given it more ""stars.""

I thought that the production conveyed a strange, dreamlike quality through the entire story, but I feel that is because it is being told from the viewpoint and memory of Stephen, who has suffered greatly during the war.

Its one of those movies that marches you slowly along, pausing, peaking, then pausing again to the ever present rhythm of soft, single piano notes. The filming is wonderful, full of sharp contrasting colors. period dress and jewelry and gritty trench warfare.

5038297,3,B006Z510Y4,"I was looking forward to watching this two-part film.  I like the book's author and I am a great fan of the actor Eddie Redmayne.

This movie is well-cast and beautifully filmed but it doesn't hold together very well and it needs to, to fill the two-episode format.  The back-and-forth flashbacks between the trenches of WW I and the scenes of the main character's pre-war love affair in idyllic and beautiful France were not always well-timed and did not serve the story well.  The main actors are attractive, many of the secondary characters are memorable, and most of the roles are well-acted but the relationship between the lovers doesn't seem well-developed or compelling enough to support their actions. A few very grim/graphic scenes in the trenches are wrenchingly realistic and the one explicit love scene is affecting but all of these could have come from a different movie.

Movie fans who love this period, as I do, will be interested in the historical aspects and will enjoy the performances but the film needed a strong directorial hand and a good editor.  I will definitely read the book.",1389657600,,1104,4.877005347593583

5038300,3,B006Z510Y4,"I am, for some unknown reasons, drawn to war films. Most big budget movies have a tendency to exploit certain parts of audience's emotion, and often try to glorify an aspect of the war of the participants. This movie was not about heroism, nor politics. Just how ordinary, natural humanness gets trumpled by the war machine and how uman heart still keeps on hoping, living and loving, I think those are the ingredients that make this movie great. For some reasons, acting was NOT that great, but the power of the story itself moved the movie forward. PBS movies are kind of odd in comparison with big studio productions and being an American audience, they create some unusual contrast with our normative expectation about a war film. But the credit of the movie is that it succeeded in depicting horror, anxiety, recklessness, commodity-like treatment of human lives, amidst greatest of uncertainty the touching effort of simple soldiers to stay human, and it did so with minimum of special effects.
I have not read the book, and some areas of the movie seemed incomplete or discontinuous or lacking flow/transitions. Director and the scriptwriter should have done a better job. I plan to read the book. Anyway, give it a go. I particularly liked the character of the main tunnel digger. For some reasons, to me, he seemed to be the protagonist, only I had to wait till the end of the movie to find out.",1389312000,2,1404,4.758196721311475

I didn't like that Isabelle left Stephen and went back to her husband she left in the first place because she got pregnant.

However, most of the other characters are not well developed, especially his love interest. Their romance begins slowly, but then they are suddenly, passionately in love with very little development. Some of her decisions make very little sense, leaving the audience confused about why we should care about her. Another character to watch is Firebrace, in whom the main character finds an unlikely kindred spirit. The scenes that feature the bond among the soldiers were the most moving in the film.

It is rare for me to enjoy a new novel so much, I tend to lean more towards the classics. This novel was amazing, realistic, and moving. I did not know how it could be translated to film. How they would capture the beauty and pain that is present within the novel.

Yet, they some how managed to do it. Of course it moved away from the novel at points, making scenes that were not present, but simply alluded to. Despite this, it was a lovely adaptation. The acting was spot on and the depictions throughout were lovely. I would highly suggest this to anyone! If you are looking for a typical feel good film and want everything to be daisies this is not the film for you. If, on the other hand, you can enjoy the beauty in pain and still see the humanity in the piece then you will love this!

His acting wasn't at fault - so where was the problem?  I don't know.  Maybe it needed a different actress - or maybe it was just the writing.  But it fell far short of what it should have been.  It does not engage you.  It does not make you care.  I didn't really care whether I saw the end or not.  That is very very rare.,1379376000,3,475,3.989247311827957

While the relationship was central to what story line I could find (and that in itself was a challenge) I think it completely unnecessary to film the scenes in such graphic ways.  I watch LOTS of British TV and drama but just had to turn this one off!,1371686400,14,387,4.676470588235294
5038352,4,B006Z510Y4,"First of all, BIRDSONG is beautifully filmed and acted. Joseph Mawle is especially memorable as Jack Firebrace--who I quote in my title here--a friend and sort of foil-character to the protagonist (Stephen Wraysford) played by Eddie Redmayne. Agree: American audiences may find all the British brogues a bit hard to follow without the subtitles.

While there is a palpable storyline and a good surprise at the end, BIRDSONG appeals more to the heart than to the head. It's quite a sad story, of course, but it avoids going too far in the direction of melodrama. It successfully incorporates some really huge themes: Love, forgiveness, loyalty, and others. There is also a great deal of WWI battle footage: BIRDSONG will probably appeal to most war film aficionados. Warning: Some really graphic scenes of carnage at the Somme and various other battles.

Part I shifts every few minutes from Wraysford's illicit 1910 love affair with the wife of a French business partner to his service in the British army between 1916-18. The two time settings are extremely well-synchronized: The directors and producers did a fine job of making the two stories into one. Part II, though it follows the same general pattern, is a little more of a straightforward, solidified story.

I haven't read Sebastian Faulks's original novel, but I've heard nothing but good things about it. It's probably a hard book to cinematize, but Masterpiece Theater did about the best job possible here.",1371513600,6,1469,5.06198347107438

When Almighty God told us not to break the Commandments,  He Meant It. A wink and nod has been given to the Movie studios and now we live with the consequences  and spiritual cost of all of it.  Must I explain the difference between love and lust or do most of you get it?  The acting was horrible, the story line was chopped up and the unredeeming end was a poor excuse for a movie. My Uncle fought in the Great War so believe me when I tell you that the men did not sit around the trenchs WHNING.

I honestly hate war films, but I started watching and could not stop. The man who played the main character Stephen, is quite brilliant.  I felt like the story needed to show more of the relationship between Stephen and Isabel, however the war scenes fill that need for more tangible feeling, and there is an ok balance of the parallel story building.

I recommend this to anyone whether interested in love and war or not.  It's beautifully filmed and directed. The score is fitting, and the settings rich. I cried at the end and thought about the tragedy that war is. It left me feeling quite bereft.

5038390,2,B006Z510Y4,"I enjoyed the love story, but felt that the rating should be higher than what it currently is. Granted the episode descriptions state that there will be graphic scenes and sexual situations, I was caught off guard at how much one actually sees of the main female character and others as well.

The story was slow and could have been told in one episode instead of two. I also did not enjoy going back and forth between the past and present day in the movie. It always took me a moment to figure out that time had passed when we would go back and forth. But this is a personal preference. If you are like me than you probably won't enjoy this show.

I would have liked the ending to be different. It seems unrealistic to me, but I won't say why for fear of spoiling it.

Overall, it was a descent story, I just wish it was rated better. Should be TV-MA instead of TV-PG. I wouldn't want my 7 year old to think that because it has the same rating as things like Star Wars: Clone Wars that he can watch this overly graphic show.",1362182400,7,1025,4.192893401015229

The novel was something I found myself really wanting to like as I read it (a few months before I watched the film), but the main character, Stephen Wraysford, kept me at a distance for much of the story. The film feels quite the same. I was not happy with the casting of Eddie Redmayne at first, as he did not physically match my and most people's idea of Stephen, but by the end of this two-part TV movie he had won me over (the war scenes are where he really shines), just as Stephen did in the book. The novel now stands as one of my favorites, despite its flaws.

This is not a perfect adaptation (it tends to reveal the book's flaws rather than patch them up - the seemingly instant yet deep romance, for example), but I think for the most part the changes and omissions it made were for the better (those who have read the book will know what I mean). I wish there was a bit more screen time devoted to Jack Firebrace's part of the story, but the ending still made me cry, and not just because the book did.

The honest treatment of sex and masculine emotion are probably why some viewers can't handle this film, its too real for them.  I'm a lifetime viewer/fan of MPT and I thought the producers made a daring, fresh choice presenting this film.  It made an emotionally complex statement and took viewers out of their comfort zones.  It was well deserving of presentation on MPT.  Eddie Redmayne!

5038432,3,B006Z510Y4,"Maybe it was a mistake to view this right after being immersed in ""Downton Abbey"". Same time period. Same Masterpiece Classic presentation. Same Battle of the Somme. But the comparisons end there. As the plot explains, Steven, a young man working for a callous factory owner in France falls in love with Isabelle, the owner's wife. The story jumps back and forth between their illicit tryst in 1910 to the horrors of trench warfare in 1916 where Steven is now a junior officer in the British Army.

The initial sequences are what lag the most. Despite the obvious attractiveness of the couple, Steven and Isabelle both seem oddly allergic to words. Instead, there are long loving gazes, long anguished gazes, long questioning gazes. They exchange about ten words between them, half of them inaudible. It is here that one misses the rich conversational wit, compassion and swordplay of ""Downton Abbey"". Isabelle abruptly disappears (we later find out why), Steven is left in torment despite having Isabelle's willing sister, Jeanne at his disposal.

The actions picks up during the World War I segments as it is obvious the Brits are still haunted by July 1, 1916, the day they lost 20,000 men in one day during the catastrophic Battle of the Somme. The blasted expanse of No-Man's Land is an exact replica of the one used in both ""Downton Abbey"" and ""War Horse"" which makes you wonder if it is a space specifically rented out for WWI movies. But the scenes of battle are unsparing and horribly graphic. Steven is assigned to a tunneling outfit, the ""Sewer Rats"" and forms a friendship of sorts with Jack Firebrace, a solid workingman who is suffering from the loss of his young son. Jack's poignancy helps mitigate Steven's wallowing self-pity as well as reminding him that love is the only thing that matters, a lesson that Steven will need to utilize to become a full man.

Steven and Isabelle reunite briefly during a lull in the fighting but I found myself not caring. I had enough of their doe-eyed gazes which lack chemistry and tension. I was more intrigued if Steven would man up and take responsibility for those others who have come into his life (I am avoiding spoilers here!).

You can't really relate to any of these characters, nor feel sorry for them and you certainly can't admire any one of them - except maybe for those poor soldiers who bought the bullets needlessly.  It would probably have been better to hear their stories than the shallow one of the French romance theme.  The lead is an empty headed soul with no moral compass and no leadership skills - how an orphan manages to appear to have the money he has and the ability to schmooze with the rich wasn't made clear.  The young cad cheats with the wife of the man supposedly his mentor in France.  There really seems no reason for their romance other than sex which the cameras kept on showing without any ""real love"" between any of the characters.  The French wife herself has no redeeming features and appears so vaccuous it was almost funny(except they try to humanize her by having her feed the poor while meanwhile cheating on her husband!). The husband is the classical ""cruel master"" so of course it makes the cheating acceptable.  The grunt soldiers are the only ones worth watching and we are never made privy into their stories very much at all.

Well, they didn't say much with their faces either.  There were graphic sex scenes that put me off--they were completely unnecessary.  I enjoy love scenes much more when it's left to my own imagination and not when I'm made a voyeur into someone else's bedroom (or behind their tree).  The only character I cared about was Firebrace.  Part II picked up speed somewhat and more happened but if you are looking for something worthy of the 2-1/2 hours, you will be disappointed.  And what does ""Birdsong"" even mean?

5038440,3,B006Z510Y4,"England is at war, and Stephen Wraysford (Eddie Redmayne) is on the front lines. In command of a group of enterprising young men digging tunnels in order to get nearer foreign forces, Stephen spends most of his time above ground... until a superior officer (Matthew Goode) tells him to take to the tunnels. His timing could not be worse. Gunfire penetrates the underground shaft, leaving him badly wounded...

But conscious to remember a much happier time... when he was employed at a textile factory in France. His employer is the wealthy, older Ren&eacute; Azaire but it is his lovely young wife Isabelle (Cl&eacute;mence Po&eacute;sy) who most attracts Stephen's attention. Quiet and self-contained, she can often be heard weeping at night. Her stepdaughter is not much younger than she is, and is romantically interested in Stephen... but he has eyes only for the beautiful young woman who suffers so much in silence. As their affair unfolds and carries them both into desperate times, the audience travels back and forth between earlier simplicity and later turmoil during wartime. Many films employ this tactic but few accomplish it with as gentle of grace as Birdsong.

Though I have not read the book, I understand that certain things, including the style of the narrative, have been changed. Fans debate heatedly over whether or not the cast is appropriate... I found them a lovely couple to watch with natural chemistry that sparks through lingering glances more than passionate love scenes. One could argue that some of these glances are too long, that eyes meeting over dinner or on the river with music dramatically swelling in the background can at times be a bit dull... and yes, it is true that it prolongs things considerably. The photography is glorious and the costuming exquisite. Too bad it misses the point of the novel, by making it seem as if they are in love. The book is about lust. The miniseries transforms it into forbidden love. There is a distinction between the two.

From a purely entertainment perspective, the first episode is terrific, and the second is considerably less so, in part because the wartime scenes are tedious and the abrupt nature of how the relationship ends is emotionally unsatisfying (we learn later the reason for her flight, but there is little build-up). Much of the last hour is downright depressing as we watch his friends die in battle, some of them brutally. The first half of this story was solid but in the second half it stumbled and lost its way, most of the tension going right along with it. Stephen cannot carry the story on his own without Isabelle, and she is absent for the most part in the last hour and a half. It needed a stronger narrative style to go with its beautiful costumes and exquisite period setting. But perhaps the most troubling is that neither character learns anything from their misbehavior or feels remorse for their actions. For me, that left the story feeling empty since when stripped of any redeeming value or moral messages, any adulterous love affair just becomes a story of extreme selfishness.

Parental Concerns: I presume this is the original, uncut British release that contains graphic sexual content (including oral), and nudity. Some war-related gore (including a man whose insides have been blown out). At least one f-word, a couple of abuses of Jesus' name, and scattered profanities.",1336435200,45,3391,4.954305799648506

5038442,5,B006Z510Y4,"Almost always, the Masterpiece folks produce a product which puts most Hollywood efforts to shame; ""Birdsong"" is such an example.  Expertly acted--Eddie Redmayne will soon become an internationally recognized actor of exceptional talent--beautifully filmed--the cinematography is nearly perfect--skillfully edited, ""Birdsong"" leaves the viewer with the feeling of having been part of something special.  It is not a movie to be watched while chatting with others, washing dishes, reading the paper, etc.; rather, it is a carefully constructed work which deserves attention to the development of the characters--pay attention to the ""silences"" while the camera focuses on the actors; their faces, eyes, movemets, are telling us something about themselves. There's plenty of action, graphic war scenes, and a bit of sex--all of which are included to enhace the development of the characters and to move the plot to its conclusion.  If you're a fan of car chase/crash movies, this is not for you. If you want to see a moving experience which clearly demonstrates a team effort(actors, director, music, camera work, editing, sound, writers, etc.)to produce a quality final product, then I recommend you take the time and watch this movie.",1335744000,10,1234,5.484210526315789
5038443,5,B006Z510Y4,"This review is of the BBC series not the book.

An orphan boy traumatized by absent parents searches for adult connection without being willing to commit to being present for the needs of others. He has an affair with a married woman and continues unwilling to honor her need to love through parenting.

Through World War I the boy experiences the challenges of adulthood, accepting responsibility for making decisions which impact others. The intensity of the combat scenes and his moments of choice are compelling illustrations of the rigors of battle, a telescoped and exaggerated trajectory of maturation not everyone survives. His team is a group of tunnelers who repeatedly experience blast trauma TBI as well as personal loss PTSD. His paramour also suffers blast trauma PTSD from a German bomb to her home.

The boy tries to protect and mentor a younger tunnel digger, introducing him to a brothel, and assigning him the task of lookout so the younger never enters the carbon monoxide filled tunnels. Eventually he learns no one can control another's life or death.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day-Special-15th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B000Z8GZYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day (Special 15th Anniversary Edition)</a>

The boy is befriended by an older miner who advises him that love is all there is ""to love and to be loved in return."" This advice provides the motivation the boy needs to survive long enough to contemplate his own coming of age and meaning in life.

The boy's immaturity due to being without role models for appropriate parenting seems prolonged, as he resists any suggestion that parenting is an honorable state. My own parents loved each other deeply and loved me as well. I was allowed curiosity about unfamiliar cultures religions geographies because of the strong grounding of knowing I was treasured. The orphan protagonist in this movie adaptation seems untethered and as a consequence sows the seeds of his own suffering with harmful choices.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Departures/dp/B002SF9YNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Departures</a>

5038444,5,B006Z510Y4,"I expected this to be good, but it was far above what I had anticipated.  Moving and thought provoking.  In particular, Joseph Mawle's performance was wonderful - subtle and powerful. Richard Madden was fantastic as well.  The only minor flaw I could post was the slow build up in the beginning, but even that was brief and lent itself to the overall tone of the film.

I highly recommend this.",1335744000,6,394,4.585714285714285
5038445,1,B006Z510Y4,"The person who wrote the description of this movie, that is on the case and also is what enticed me purchase this, must have read the book.  Because none of the plot described in print is contained in the movie.  The move has long sequences of silent stares into the camera, some gore, and some (oh I am glad the kids are not in the room sequences).  Sadly the movie is so bad I am not even enticed to see if the book actually contains plot. This is my first wrong movie purchase of the year.",1335398400,15,492,4.104166666666667
5038446,5,B006Z510Y4,"I watched the first half of this two part series on television on Sunday night in HD (it was beautiful) and the second half after I rented the dvd.  The first part is now available through 5/22 on the PBS website.
I also watched all 3 short extra feature documentaries.
This is a wonderful film, however it should be noted that there are several fairly graphic war scenes and several scenes with sexuality.

The three short documentary featurettes are also worth watching.  One addresses the love story, one addresses the war story and the third featurette discusses the behind the scenes filming.  The movie was filmed in part in Budapest, Hungary.  The actors, director, producer and costume designer all speak warmly and intensely of their involvement in the production.

This film is a not-to-be-missed Masterpiece theatre two-part series.  If you have read the book, you will find some differences.  I won't go into detail, since I have not read the book as of yet (I have skimmed through it), but one major difference is that the 1970's part of the novel is not included in the film.  That is probably no great loss, since many readers felt that this part of the book was not necessary.

Clemence Poesy (Isabelle Azaire) is stunning and Eddie Redmayne (Stephen) is also captivating.  The juxtaposition of a love story and the historically realistic gut-wrenching story of the loyalty and comraderie among soldiers in the tunnels of France in WWI makes for a very solid plot.

The second half of this series will be presented on many PBS Stations on Sunday evening, April 29th.  It's well worth a look!

I will add more to this review at a later date.",1335312000,43,1656,4.764912280701754
