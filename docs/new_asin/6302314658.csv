453148,5,6302314658,"C'mon along and join Doris Day and a top supporting cast in a high-stepping musical feast - the infectious LULLABY OF BROADWAY!

Melinda Howard (Doris Day) a young up-and-coming musical star, has just arrived back in New York, totally unaware that her mother Jessica (Gladys George), once the biggest star on Broadway, is now singing in a dingy tavern.  The mansion which Jessica used to  own has now been taken over by a rich brewery magnate and his wife (S.Z. Sakall and Florence Bates).

Old-time vaudevilians Lefty and Gloria (Billy DeWolfe and Anne Triola), now the butler and maid of the house, take Melinda under their wing and uphold the ruse that Jessica is just 'out of town'...

Complications arise when Melinda finds herself on the cusp of Broadway fame, just as Jessica's cover is blown!  Gene Nelson co-stars as the brash and confident dancer who falls in love with Melinda.

Doris Day as usual gives her all in the lead role.  Gladys George was a perfect casting choice for Melinda's washed-up alcoholic mother and Florence Bates is fun in one of her trademark 'society matron' roles.  Billy DeWolfe, S.Z. Sakall and Gene Nelson would go on to co-star with Doris Day again in the successful TEA FOR TWO (both movies were made and released in the same year and were big box office drawcards for Warners).

A top Hollywood musical.",1112313600,13,1344,4.779220779220779
453149,4,6302314658,"She's a singer and a tap-dancer.  Doris Day does it all.  She is an entertainer aboard  a cruise ship.  She's come back to the United States to visit her mother.  Her mother is also a singer, but in a nightclub.  What Doris does not know, her mother no longer has the New York house and she is no longer a well-known Broadway star.  She is too ashamed to see her daughter the way her life has turned.  Very nice musical!  Tunes include: ""Lullaby of Broadway"", ""In a Shanty In Old Shanty Town"", ""Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart"", ""Somebody Loves Me"", ""I Love The Way You Say Goodnight"".
  Also in the cast: Billy DeWolfe (one of Doris' closest friends), Gladys George, Florence Bates and Anne Triola.
  Best line: Doris gives Gene Nelson a gift.  She says that there is a message on there for you.  It's a 1949 penny that says atop, ""In God We Trust"".

I've just bought this video, and I would recommend it to anyone. Doris Day is my favourite actress of all time, and she teams well with Gene Nelson (who is a fantastic dancer).",1021248000,15,320,4.440677966101695
453152,4,6302314658,"The 1951 Warner Brothers release, ""Lullaby of Broadway"" was a big success at the box-office. Warners had taken the hit song from one of their big 1930's extravaganzas, dressed it all in pretty technicolor, given it a typical back-stage storyline and filled it with a lot of talented and gifted performers.  It was a surefire recipe for success and it succeeded admirably.
From the opening frames when star Doris Day, donned in a tux, ala Eleanor Powell, sings and dances her way delightfully through Cole Porter's ""Just One of Those Things"", the audience is whisked away on a melodic journey. The songs come fast and furious thereby capably keeping the audience from realizing they'd seen the story done before and that the chemistry between Miss Day and co-star Gene Nelson is more like that between a brother and a sister than two sweethearts.
Doris Day arrives in America to visit her mother who she has been led to believe is a great American star. The plot deals with the efforts of those around her in preventing her from realizing the truth.  In the meantime Doris meets talented dancer Nelson, they fall in love, and by the end of the picture Day is rendering the ultimate version of the title tune in a lavish number that'll leave a smile on everyones' face.
After only three years of making films, Doris Day easily proves why her rise to superstardom was accompished so quickly. While there is little to challenge her thespian skills, she makes the most of the opportunities presented and is completely winning and natural. It's during the musical sequences that she shows why she was Warner Brothers best musical asset in the late 40's and early 50's.  No one else could come close.
Gene Nelson is a very talented and athletic dancer.  His ""Zing Went the Strings of My Heart"" is a kockout. He and Miss Day make a great dancing pair, in particular doing ""You're Getting To Be a Habit With Me"" and a new song composed for the picture, ""I Love The Way You Say Goodnight"". As previously noted however, the chemistry Day had with other Warner co-stars such as Gordon MacRae and even Jack Carson, seems to be missing. It throws the picture ever so slightly off balance.
S.Z. Sakall and Florence Bates are a delight in supporting roles, as are Billy DeWolfe and Anne Triola, as musical ""staff"" to Sakall and Bates. Gladys George, a notable dramatic actress in the 1930's, provides a moving and powerful portrayal as Day's mother and they have a scene together that is extremely effective.
While I don't think it quite measures up to some of Day's other Warners pictures, ""Lullaby of Broadway"" is nevertheless a tuneful formula picture, blessed with some fine talent and if you're not tapping your feet during Day's snappy rendition of the title tune, then you need to check for a pulse. This is one lullaby that won't put you to sleep.",1010102400,58,2839,4.717741935483871
453153,5,6302314658,"I've watched the video about 4 or 5 times and I have come to the conclusion that the film is about one of the best early Doris Day films in existence.  The dancing, the singing and the cute story are but a few of  the wonderful things the film has to offer.  The supporting cast,  especially S.Z. Sakall, who was a great Viennese actor in early 1930s,  provides one of the best examples of character acting in movie musical  history.  Florence Bates and Anne Triola, who teams with Billy DeWolfe, are  excellent in their roles, too.  You would be foolish to pass this one up!",959299200,14,575,4.4

453182,4,6302314658,"- Adolph Hubbell: ""Ferndel was right, you have no eye for beautiful women.""
- Lefty Mack: ""You shouldn't judge me by my wife.""

I'm not so well-versed with her film catalogue that I can say for sure that this is the most accomplished Doris Day has ever hoofed it onscreen, but, dang, she's really good here. In some parallel universe, Doris Day, who started out as a dancer, didn't have that debilitating car collision that planted her in a wheelchair for months and so didn't have the time in which all she did was listen to the radio and sing along with the on-air band singers. Back in our real world, today, she's remembered in pictures predominantly as a singer. There weren't a lot of movies in which she regularly cut a rug.

1951's LULLABY OF BROADWAY opens with her all gigged out in top hat and tails, and she's dancing and belting out a rollicking shipboard rendition of ""Just One of Those Things."" Doris plays Melinda Howard, who is broke and enroute back to America after years of song & dancing it overseas. Melinda is over the moon to meet up with her mom, that famous Broadway star Jessica Howard, whom she hadn't seen in ages. She maybe should've given her mom a heads up.

The plot revolves a bit around that ""Let's put on a show"" theme and mostly around that ""Let's put on a pretense"" theme. Jessica Howard (Gladys George), unbeknownst to her daughter, had fallen on hard times. She'd long ago sold her luxurious Manhattan home to a beer magnate and is today a down-and-out has-been and a shabby lush. She's mortified when she learns that her daughter is back in town and means to reconnect. Her ex-vaudeville pals - Lefty Mack (Billy DeWolfe from DEAR RUTH) and Gloria (Anne Triola) - happen to be servants at her old home where her daughter's just showed up. They're willing to collude and filibuster and just plain out pretend that the ""great Broadway legend"" is away on tour but please, Melinda, make yourself at home. Even that beer magnate Adolph Hubbell (played by that adorable gent S.Z. Sakall) - who prefers other beer to his own product - goes along with the masquerade. The beer magnate's wife, though, is left in the dark, and this omission bites the conspiracy in the butt later on.

I say 4 out of 5 stars for LULLABY OF BROADWAY, not so much for the barely-there plotline but for the film's inherent goodnaturedness and because Doris Day's patented the adjectives ""warm"" and ""accessible"" and because these are familiar songs of Americana given righteous treatment and, also, the dance numbers are aces. Besides Doris Day's, er, putting her best foot forward, her love interest Gene Nelson steps in more than adequately as that tap dancing showman Tom Farnham. I'd never seen Nelson in much of anything. But my eyes got a bit big when he promptly demonstrated not only a sharp dancing style but virtuoso athleticism as well (check out what he gets up to in ""Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart""). Maybe my favorite number here is Doris' dance duet with Nelson during ""Somebody Loves Me."" I loved their mirror bit in that number. We'll just never mind that little trivia about Gene Nelson's singing voice being dubbed. When you can do mad acrobatics with a piano like Gene Nelson, much can be forgiven. There's also a marionette specialty number here which, when I found out how it was done, made my jaw drop. But maybe you'll be more blas about it, you worldly old soul, you.",1380326400,,3408,4.628099173553719

453188,4,6302314658,"This Technicolor musical from 1951 (Warner) has the effervescent Doris Day and the equally energetic Gene Nelson in the starring roles. To my mind, Gene Nelson is in the same class as Astaire as a singer and dancer and he gets to display his talents in this movie. The fun moments are provided by Billy De Wolfe and S.Z. Sakall.

The story concerns a stage musical star (Doris Day) who comes to see her mother in New York, who was formerly a star but is now reduced to performing in a sleazy nightclub, a demise that has also driven her to drink. The supporting cast keep this from her daughter until a final happy reunion. There is a sub-plot concerning show producer Sakall and his wife which adds to the humour. In fact, the plot is more substantial than in many a Hollywood musical but the main attraction of course is the music and dancing.

There are a host of familiar numbers including the title song by Harry Warren (mus.) and Al Dubin (lyr.), together with their `You're getting to be a habit with me', Porter's `Just one of those things', an early Gershwin melody, `Somebody loves me' with lyrics by Ballard MacDonald and Buddy De Sylva (before he teamed up with Brown and Henderson and went on to help found Capitol Records), James Hanley's `Zing went the strings of my heart', and still more.

453189,5,6302314658,"... one of my all time favorite musical songs sung by Doris Day.

Never seen before this movie but I had been curious about. Not bad. Doris Days sings the songs more with swing, Gene Nelson Tap-Dancing isn't bad... but when I'm comparing the tap-dances of the Song ""Lullaby of Broadway"" with this Movie and ""Gold Diggers of 1935"" then definitive I prefer the 1935 version. There it was a much bigger scene, more innovativ.

This movie isn't bad. No, its funny. Specially S.Z.Sakall is funny with his nervous gestic / acting and accent.
Doris Days singing also is great like all the time and Gene Nelson tap dancing very good too.

A specially dancing scene: the dancing doll!!!

The DVD:

The picture quality is incredible good, no damages or something. The sound is in MONO and good too.

Bonus: only a few Doris Day movie trailer.

The final sequence in the movie is a beautiful wonder. A little known fact about the sequence that must be noted is that Doris had been in a serious accident where a car she was in had damaged her legs and left a weakness in them. In that final dance, she was required to dance up and down a tall series of  very narrow stairs. It was a dangerous thing for her to do and would have been ill advised and because of the weakness of her legs it was more dangerous for her. Asked how they got her to perform this dangerous dance, the director was asked how they got her to take this great risk. The answer was that they had simply decided not to tell her how dangerous it was and she performed it perfectly.
  I had the opportunity to attend a lecture by her co-star Gene Nelson. Gene, an incredibly talented gymnast ( never seen in any of his movies, unfortunately) and dancer, he said that of all the women he had worked with, Doris day was the most talented partner ever.
