6452507,5,B00KW85MNK,I got a steel guitar for a gift. It was my first musical instrument and a little intimidating. I found the Joe Dochtermann series online and with a quick watch of his video I bought the disc 1. He made the playing process really easy to understand and the camera angle was a great benefit to see the instrument being played. He also includes a great eBook and other materials to help you learn the concepts. He teaches very well and I would recommend this item to anyone wanting to learn the lap steel.,1422576000,10,502,4.351063829787234
6452508,5,B00KW85MNK,"Ok, so I have had a lap steel for about 12 years and have played it about 12 times.  I love the sound of it when others play it, but I had no idea where to begin learning the basics.  I found this DVD on amazon and thought that I would give it a try.  This dvd has is all...everything from tuning to how to play a tune!  There are closeups of the hands so you can really see whats being played.  (Thanks for that)  And get this...the GUITAR TAB is right on screen.  The video kept me interested and made me want to play more.  Enough typing, I got to go play!!!  Thanks",1408579200,6,569,3.9210526315789473
6452509,5,B00KW85MNK,I ordered from joedocmusic.com amd the dvd came promptly. This is a wonderful way for a beginner to learn the sometimes tricky C6 tuning on the nonpedal lap steel. Joe takes you through the basics and includes a handy ebook on the dvd. All the instructions are organized in a way that you can refer back to them  many times as you progress. The c6 tuning is familar to most as the playing of Don Helms with Hank Williams. A must have if you persue the sublime sound of the lap steel.,1404000000,6,483,4.25
6452510,5,B00KW85MNK,Very well presented lessons that's easy to follow.,1461715200,2,50,5.375
6452511,3,B00KW85MNK,It is okay,1453766400,,10,2.6666666666666665
6452512,4,B00KW85MNK,"I found the material presented in a logical and straightforward way.  It is presented as if you know nothing about steel guitar or music or chords etc.  Starts out with tuning the instrument, then on to some basic music theory.  It would appear that steel guitar requires a little more understanding of music theory than say regular guitar or ukulele.  I like the ""TAB"" and music score superimposed above the instruction.  It really helps me follow along and keep pace with the instruction.  Learning to play the lap steel is going to be a real challenge.  There is so much going on at the same time.  I like this DVD a lot and feel it will teach me to actually play steel guitar.",1453593600,8,680,4.471544715447155
6452513,5,B00KW85MNK,This book is very thoughtfully written. It will take you from  not knowing anything about music/chords to learning the lap steel. I highly recommend this book for the beginners.,1445126400,,177,5.103448275862069
6452514,5,B00KW85MNK,"This instructional DVD is superb! Joe's teaching method is clear and easy to understand and he's a real pro. If you want learn lap steel guitar, then look no further. This is what you need.",1440374400,3,189,4.428571428571429
6452515,5,B00KW85MNK,"Have you ever heard a piece of music played and wished you could play it just as well. I watched the YouTube video 'Sleep Walk' played by Joe Doc and instantly knew I was going to be able to play it. Why? The video explained in great detail step by step how to play the number, I just couldn't fail. I'm not quite as good as Joe yet, but I'm getting there and quickly. Being so easy this spurred me on to buy Joe's DVD 'Learn to play C6 lap steel guitar' which takes you by the hand explaining so many things you need to know in order to play the lap steel guitar correctly, but what I found most interesting and compelling  was that the DVD enables you to progress quickly using Joe's unique technique. I particularly liked the track 'Slow blues in G' which I've already started. I'm a great believer in if you have the correct basics then you can progress at your own speed to achieve great things. The DVD is excellent and I would highly recommend it.",1424908800,6,954,4.241758241758242
6452516,4,B00KW85MNK,"I am a somewhat experienced guitar and bass guitar player, but C6 lapsteel is completely new to me. So far I have found this DVD and the accompanying guide very useful. I'm on the tenth lesson, have learned quite a bit and can now play some. For me, the pace seems just about perfect. I might give it five stars, but the menu system is a tad clunky, and seems to be more for MS-Windows, and I'm using a MacBook. But it certainly plays, and I can move around when really needed.",1423872000,5,477,4.195652173913044
6452517,5,B00KW85MNK,"I, like others, have seen Joe play & explain/play ""Sleep Walk"" on YouTube...the clear verbal instruction, camera angle & super-imposed notation made me think that playing lap steel would be, for me, possible? I am an old bass player, fretted & fretless J's & P's...the strange thing on my lap got a few fruitless attempts, then a lot of neglect...I decided to make it a goal for '15 and chose this as my 'guide'. Got it last week, watched it all the way through, just enjoying how clearly & thoughtfully the student is led through steps to success: Tuning, hand positions, slide techniques, (The DREADED) theory, exercises & some nice tunes & improvs. Camera angle is like sitting on his shoulders & even screen-in-screen when something intricate is going on with finger work...this is a GREAT series of lessons! Add to this the amazing buncha extras: play-along tracks & an ebook; 139 .pdf pages of reference, additional info (Wanna know which PEDALS to use with Lap Steel?), and lessons to refer to...load this into your iPad & drill anywhere you want! Again, one great resource for the beginner to intermediate player! I have to spend some time training my big ol' meathooks, but this thing is getting me there! Mahalo nui loa, Joe!",1423612800,5,1235,4.802816901408451

6452519,5,B00KW85MNK,"I have had a lap steel sitting gathering dust for the past 3 years, because I just couldn't get started.  I tried learning from two different CD's that were offered, but found them too confusing to continue, therefore the dust gathering began.  By chance I happened to come across Joe playing on You Tube teaching notation and tabs for Santo and Johnny's ""Sleep Walk"".  I nearly fell out of my chair because he makes it so easy to understand, and it seemed as though I could finally put my desire to play in motion.  I was right!  Joe carefully goes through the process a non performing musician, (like me), can understand and practice with.  I hope to post my own You Tube video soon in tribute to Joe who encouraged me to dust that instrument!",1422921600,21,745,4.481481481481482
8662160,5,B00KW85MNK,"The guy is the perfect teacher -- you will be playing some pretty good licks in a short time, and get an understanding of basic theory.",1524528000,,135,4.230769230769231

8662166,5,B00KW85MNK,"This is the best tutorial of any kind I have seen for lap steel guitar. I have played guitar and other stringed instruments for over 50 years, but am new to lap steel. I had a question about accessing the e-book that was included with the DVD and I e-mailed Joe who responded almost immediately to address my question.
I will certainly purchase the 2nd DVD after getting through all the material in the first.",1494720000,,409,4.466666666666667
