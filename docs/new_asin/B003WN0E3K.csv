8651564,2,B003WN0E3K,"I recently purchased this DVD and took a gamble since there were no reviews. The DVD is informative but its very general and only addresses basic issues. The 180 degree rule and shot type, for example. Before I knew it, the credits were rolling. I'm disappointed that it didn't go into more depth. Also, I found it very strange that the directing ""teacher"" had to keep looking off screen for what I imagined were his talking points. Fairly ironic, after he just went on a spiel about being prepared at all times. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone who has a solid grasp on the fundamentals of directing and wants to get into more detail.",1324944000,7,642,4.543103448275862
