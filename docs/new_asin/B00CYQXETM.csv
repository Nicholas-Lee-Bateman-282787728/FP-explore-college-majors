5755005,5,B00CYQXETM,Munich-Angie's review was spot-on! I too consider 5-O my favorite show but Season 4 seemed to belong to Michelle  Borth (Catherine)........I'm not at all a fan of Borth. Wish the writers would stick with the core four.,1411171200,3,218,4.891891891891892
5755006,5,B00CYQXETM,"I love this show. I like the deleted scenes and wish there were in the show seen on tv. The gag reel is so funny it is always a keeper. It lets you see the actors messing up and having fun. I love all my DVD s of Hawaii Five-0 old and new shows. I think Alex, Scott,Daniel, Grace do an excellent job of acting.",1411171200,2,310,3.7846153846153845
5755007,1,B00CYQXETM,I've been a fan of the show since the beginning and I have the first three seasons on Blu-ray. I was expecting to get season four on Blu-ray but lo and behold it's only available on DVD. Where is the Blu-ray? Does anyone know when it will be available?  I don't understand why the DVD and Blu-ray are released at the same time most of us want to watch the show in 1080 HD.,1411084800,27,372,4.027027027027027
5755008,5,B00CYQXETM,"When it comes to the DVD or Blu-Ray season sets,  what many are curious about are the exclusive extras that are included so that is the focus of this review.  I really enjoyed the deleted scenes featured and appreciated that they are packaged to follow each episode rather than being bunched together at the end. The expanded Pearl Harbor show feature is itself worth the price of admission.

Of special interest to me were the added scenes from the just completed Season Four Halloween themed episode since I was an extra on that show.  I even found myself included again in the deleted scenes feature. More significant though was seeing how the added scenes expanded on the story line.  So if you enjoyed the shows when they aired you have a special treat in store when you rewatch them with the added deleted scenes.

If you have read this far and are curious as to my role I was one of the costumed party guests who stepped out of the Party Bus when Steve and Danno pulled up to the parking area in Danno's new black Camaro.  My character's silver Mercedes was parked next to the black BMW, the vehicle that caught the attention of the detective duo as being the victim's car.  I then appear at the costumed Halloween Party as background when Steve and Danno head toward the party's host,  as well as while they are interrogating him,  and then again as they depart. The above referenced deleted scene expands upon their entrance to the mansion where the Halloween part is being held and includes interior shots of the mansion that were cut from the broadcast show.  It was fun seeing many of my fellow ""background actors""  dressed in their Halloween costumes, individuals whom I had become acquainted with during the shooting of the show. I was even reminded of the trays of weird Halloween treats that were being passed around for us to eat as we were being filmed when a plate of black bat wings prominently showed up in the deleted scene. My favorite though were the cream cheese filled fig eyeballs.

Watching the Season Four DVD or Blu-Ray will bring back many fond memories for all.  Apart from the Halloween themed episode titled ""Broken,""  the Pearl Harbor and the bombed building episodes are unique to Season Four.  For the latter two,  elaborate sets were created and there is a feature in the Season Four DVD and Blue-ray sets related to the Pearl Harbor episode that is not to be missed.  The bombed building was constructed right on the parking lot of the Hawaii Film Studios in the shadow of Dimond Head where the original series was filmed  (along with Magnum P.I. and LOST among others.)  This was the episode where Steve and Danno are trapped in the rubble for almost the entire  show.

Adding a personal note, when I had a chance to rewatch the above referenced Party Bus scene I was reminded of how well the entire Hawaii Five-0 ohana from costuming - to crew -  to the main actors themselves treated those of us with minor roles.  We had at least four takes as the Party Bus circled around, stopped, and then we stepped out.  When we left the Party Bus after it looked like our scene was a wrap, Steve and Danno, both of whom had been standing out in the rain, climbed aboard.  Then the director decided he wanted one more take so were ushered back onto the Party Bus.  As we climbed back on, Alex who plays Steve McGarrett, was in my seat.  He and Danno stood up immediately and told us they were getting off.  I told them they were welcome to stay and then added, ""It's nice to meet you guys.""  Alex immediately responded, ""Nice to meet you too.""

Finally had a chance to take a look at the Gag Reel feature on the DVD for last season's  Hawaii Five-0.  Was surprised to see my shared Party Bus scene featured as the opening gag.  You see the Party Bus driver using some deleted words in his one line.

When that scene was shot I was standing there in the rain at 4:00 AM in the morning.  Along side me was Alex o'loughlin (character Steve McGarrett) and the Steadicam operator hand holding the camera as Alex kept prompting the driver to ham it up by adding expletives. That was the final scene to be shot, as all of the rest of the shooting had wrapped by that point, and those few of us still on set were sharing in Alex's comedic relief.  I knew those takes would never make it onto the show but little did I expect to see one of them surface in a Gag Reel.",1410825600,6,4389,4.448060075093867
5755009,5,B00CYQXETM,"I've followed this show from the start and think it's got the perfect mix of several ""ingredients"" that make it the best show on TV to me - and it's been getting even better in season 4 although the previous three seasons were fantastic, too.
The cast (incl. famous guest-stars such as the legendary Carol Burnett) is very talented. The characters are super-likeable. There is a lot of humour, character-based storylines, as well as action and, of course, crime - all of these make this show extremely entertaining and worth watching. And, last but not least, the show is based in Hawaii so you often get to enjoy very beautiful scenery with beaches, surfers etc.
Despite the many funny and enjoyable features of the show, however, its writers are also brave enough to tackle very serious, delicate subjects, as could be seen in episode 4.10 which dealt with the Pearl Harbor attack and the internment camps for Japanese Americans in Hawaii. This episode received a lot of well-deserved praise from fans and in the media.
The Season 4 DVDs are definitely a must-buy for fans - and if you aren't a fan yet, you should get the previous DVDs, too, and catch up on what you missed!",1403913600,15,1177,4.690821256038648
5755010,5,B00CYQXETM,"Being a faithful fan for three seasons, owning DVDs AND Blu Rays for all three, and anticipating an exciting new season, I see no reason not to plan ahead for S4's DVD!

One little bit of advice, Amazon! Hawaii Five-0 (2010) is written with a zero, not the letter O. That is how it is differentiated from the Classic 5-O, which does use the zero. Trust me fans of both series' do know the difference!",1374019200,17,400,4.333333333333333

5755102,5,B00CYQXETM,"This excellent remake of the original CBS crime drama ""Hawaii Five-O"" features Alex O'Loughlin as Commander Steve McGarrett, the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O, along with Scott Caan portraying his loyal sidekick, Detective Danny Williams. This fourth season of ""Hawaii Five-O"" continues its depiction of the exploits of Commander Steve McGarrett, Detective Danny Williams, and the other members of the Special Task Force, as they valiantly battle the criminal element in the state of Hawaii. ""Hawaii Five-O"" is characterized by superb writing, acting, and development of its story lines, and the various crime capers are interesting and engaging. In addition, the beautiful Hawaiian scenery is absolutely spectacular. There is a strong camaraderie among the members of the Hawaii Five-O Special Task Force, and the conclusion of each episode with a team dinner on the beach serves to highlight their dedication to the overall mission, and to each other. This remake of ""Hawaii Five-O"" is a supremely entertaining crime drama, and I enthusiastically give it a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485648000,,1160,5.45

The show is great, but if you watched the firsts season on blu-ray I ain't gonna lie to you, visually you are going to feel a little disappointed since there is a big difference.

The show itself is great. I just wished CBS would hace invested on continue with the blu-ray format of this series.

5755802,4,B00CYQXETM,"Like in the prior seasons there is a lot going on in season 4.  This season put some storylines on the back burner (namely the whole Doris/Wo Fat story), that while it was referenced throughout the season, it was done largely without Christine Lahti and Mark Dacascos appearing.  Dacascos does appear in a handful of episodes, but Lahti is mainly absent, as is Terry O'Quinn as Joe White.  The show did a good job of advancing the story a bit this season however without getting too bogged down in it, or giving too much away.  The Kono/Adam storyline was also sporadic this season mainly because of Grace Park's real life pregnancy.  She was basically a recurring character for the first part of the season, and came back toward the end.

Two new recurring characters were added to the cast this season, Chi McBride (playing swat commander Lou Grover) and Lost alum Jorge Garcia, playing a local conspiracy theorist and high school class mate of Chin Ho, Jerry Ortega.  This season also saw the phasing out of Michelle Borth's character Catherine, after Borth announced that she was not returning for the 5th season.  All the changes made this season much more case-of-the week than even the prior seasons had been.  While some of the prior season's story arcs are referred to in this season, they do not really get revisited as much.  The major family related drama this season involves Danny's mother, who is played by Melanie Griffith who has a multi-episode arc about 2/3 of the way into the season.

As for extras, it pretty much follows prior seasons.  A gag reel, some behind the scenes materials, a feature on the big action/stunt sequences of the season, and a small feature on Chi McBride and his character.  There are also deleted scenes and commentary tracks on select episodes.  The only real drawback is that the studio decided to cheap out and after releasing the first 3 seasons on blu ray, only released this one on DVD much like occurred with shows like The Americans, Modern Family and Bones.  That may be a deal breaker for some but not for others.",1423958400,6,2069,4.708333333333333

5755962,3,B00CYQXETM,"Love this series! The dvd quality is ok, but this series in particular with its vivid colors really screams for a high definition offering. I am truly amazed they don't offer this on blu ray. If they did I would rate this product a 5. But as is, it is frankly not nearly as good as it could be.",1421366400,,294,4.0
5756073,1,B00CYQXETM,"First off this one star review is for how this season was released, not for the show.  I love Hawaii Five-0 and season four is no exception.  I am not happy how Paramount decided to release this season of the show.  I own the first three seasons of Hawaii Five-0 on Blu ray and I love them, and I was expecting to buy season 4 on Blu ray as well.  However, for some reason Paramount decided not to release this season on Blu ray.  This is a beautiful show and seeing it on DVD does not do it justice, and after reading some of the other reviews, it looks like others feel the same way.  I hope that more people complain to Paramount and they decide fix their error, and release this season and following seasons on Blu ray.  Thank you for listening to this Montanan who needs to get her fix of Hawaii in full HD.",1421366400,34,812,4.13375796178344
5756074,4,B00CYQXETM,"I was looking forward to season 4 of this excellent series. I watched the previous seasons in HD blu ray. Therefore I was extremely disappointed when this season was available in DVD format only. The video quality is fair to poor, even by DVD standards. A great show and cast set in the beautiful Hawaain islands is spoiled by the video presentation. If any show deserves blu ray treatment it is this one. I would have given it 5 stars except for the DVD format. I hope the studio reconsiders offering this and future seasons in blu  ray.",1421193600,9,538,4.489795918367347

I love the scenery and the characters are good.  I could do without quite so much bickering between Steve and Dano but other than that they are good.,1519776000,,290,4.142857142857143
