Please do not give your money to this dvd",1209081600,4,290,3.9322033898305087

8204749,5,B000S8CLU6,Cheaters do get caught and dealtwith . Lots of action .Highly recommended.,1446681600,,74,5.25

8204752,3,B000S8CLU6,"I thought that it would be like vol. 1 but, come to find out it wasn't half of what I thought it would be. Yes, they had a lot of cussing in it but I was expecting a lot more nudity than the occasionally shot here and a shot there and most of the stories didn't even have nudity or cussing just a regular episode. If your searching for more action and nudity and cussing I would stick with the first volume it was way better.",1389225600,3,425,3.953488372093023
8204753,3,B000S8CLU6,"I purchased this after viewing The Best of Cheaters, Vol. 1: Uncensored  A lot of the episodes on this one were on Volume 1.

There really wasn't anything that hot, except a little cursing. It also seemed to be a little shorter than the advertised running time. There were a few episodes on here that I hadn't seen, and being Cheaters, it was still entertaining. However, for the price I paid it was a disappointment. I would skip this one, but I highly recommend Vol. 1",1361491200,2,470,4.453488372093023
8204754,5,B000S8CLU6,"The Best of CHEATERS, Vol. 2:  Too Hot For TV is really intense.  Watching this set uncut made the show way better than it already is.  Scenes were intense and showed everything and I do mean everything.  I especially loved the bonus material at the end of disk 4 which went straight to the client briefing and then to the confrontation.  The bonus material must have been clips from the first volume because none of the extra footage came from volume 2.  I would recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of cheaters and those who are occasional viewers; you would really enjoy watching this set.  WOW!!  What A Great BUY!!!",1315872000,,625,4.469026548672566
8204755,5,B000S8CLU6,"I loved this entire purchase, the price was great and I laughed. I bought this as a week night DVD relaxation for my wife and I; and we both loved it. Watching ""Cheaters"" always makes us laugh; and it always makes my wife realize that she loves me (at least she isn't married to a cheating redneck from the ATL).",1242000000,5,312,4.216666666666667
