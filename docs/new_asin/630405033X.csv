768410,5,630405033X,"Anyone not already acquainted with Guy Maddin's work can't possibly know what to expect when viewing this film for the first time.  I had never heard of Maddin before, but I first saw it screened at a small art house,  and I found it both fascinating and hilarious.  Anyone with an affinity for  old (ca. 1920s and 1930s) German  expressionist films like Nosferatu and  The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari should like the cinematography.  It beautifully  replicates the cramped, claustrophobic, deeply-shadowed,  artificial-looking, distorted and surreal settings of expressionist films  (in color, yet).  The soundtrack even has a fake layer of noise added, to  bolster the illusion of an old film.  It is also inspired by the so-called  ""mountain films"" from Germany (see Riefensthal's ""Blue  Light,"" for example).  The acting is also purposely stilted,  artificial and stylized, to hilarious effect.  The plot is a quagmire of  tortuous, pseudo-Freudian hang-ups that seem to doom everyone to a tragic  end.  This may sound grim, but it's not meant to be taken seriously.  This  is definitely something different, if that's what you're looking for, and  as I've said, anyone who likes expressionist films should love this, as  familiarity with the old films makes this one even more funny.  I do wish  the tape would come down in price though.  More people could then get to  know this rare treat.  While a DVD would be wonderful, I suppose it's  unlikely.",912470400,8,1451,5.072649572649572

768524,4,630405033X,"Here is the near genius of this film: you could read the script or someone could describe each shot, scene, sequence in detail and not come close to the power, the amazing humor of watching what happens when people are so careful that they are overtaken by the desires they desperately want to repress.

The film takes place in a mountain village where people live in such fear of an avalanche that they repress most of their speech and even more of their desires.  Of course, the repressed and sublimated emotions come roaring back with a vengeance and all hell breaks loose.

Yes, the tinted look  and scratchy sound track add to the dreaminess.  But, it could have been shot with straight B&W or color and with flawless sound and it would still come across as one of most original things you've ever experienced because the script and directing are so saturnalian. Every shot is utterly and perfectly composed as well.",1367798400,,921,4.695652173913044
768525,5,630405033X,"This film is an exquisite work of art. Every frame of film seems to have been composed with as much attention to detail as any painting hanging in your local art museum. The story is admittedly bizarre, and the presentment may be even more bizarre, but there is no doubt that this film is a masterpiece. The colors, the colors! They seem to be attuned to the mood of the scene, very subtly but very effectively. If you're reading this review, you NEED to see this film... now that it's FINALLY been re-released!

For the uninitiated, I like to describe Guy Maddin's films thusly:

Imagine sitting in your living room in the middle of the night.  You are suffering from a cold/fever that doesn't cause you excessive discomfort but slightly affects your cognitive abilities.  You have also taken a dose of Nyquil larger than Vicks recommends.

Now imagine that you are watching a bad print of an old film on television.  The pictures swoon, fading and reappearing.  The sound pops and crackles, causing rampant audio hallucinations (Was that sound in the story or just on the film print? HINT: It's BOTH!!!).

The next morning, you awake on your couch drenched in sweat, completely incapable of determining if the movie you watched was real or if you dreamt the whole thing...",1260835200,4,1274,4.759090909090909
768526,4,630405033X,"Easily one of the most distinctive and remarkable talents of the past two decades is the criminally little known Guy Maddin, a man obsessed with silent movies, early talkies, black and white images, twisted early memories and much more. He's made a string of utterly original films, ranging from operatic shorts that use Russian silent cinema as a touchstone to pseudo-documentaries about his own childhood. You simply can't go wrong with this guy if you're any sort of film buff. The Guy Maddin Collection ($34.99; Zeitgeist) contains two films -- Twilight of the Ice Nymphs and Archangel -- and that brilliant short, The Heart Of The World.) His most recent film My Winnipeg (2008) reenacts supposed scenes from his childhood like a fever dream. Dracula: Pages From A Virgin's Diary ($29.99; Zeitgeist) takes the Royal Winnipeg Ballet's production of the classic horror novel down the rabbit hole. I haven't mentioned several gems but perhaps the best introduction is Careful ($29.99; Zeitgeist) a ""remastered and repressed"" new edition of this movie about a village in the mountains in the 1800s. Everyone -- men, women, children and even creatures -- have to be utterly quiet for fear of starting an avalanche. With this absurd premise, Maddin revels in silent film techniques, beautiful tinting and sexual frenzy barely tamped down by society. It's devilishly clever and absorbing and comes with loads of extras like a new commentary by Maddin, a 1997 documentary about his career narrated by Tom Waits, a short film and more. Essential viewing.",1245369600,9,1550,5.130434782608695
768527,4,630405033X,"If you love early George Arliss films (EARLY George Arliss films), you'll love Guy Maddin's works. He revels in chemical fades, Vitaphone surface noise and the limits of Orthochrome - even though his films are in a sort-of hand-tinted-postcard-color. His is a dry wit-like nitrate stock turning to powder...",1237939200,12,307,5.285714285714286

768529,5,630405033X,"I'll never forget the first time I saw a Guy Maddin film--it was ""Tales from Gimli Hospital."" When it ended I sat quietly for a few moments and just muttered ""Holy Cow"" over and over. ""Gimli"" is an early and very low budget effort. ""Careful"" shows Guy nearing a peak that hopefully will go on for a few more decades.
Guy somehow (and miraculously) manages to sum up the entire history of cinema in his work. While there's much chatter about his obvious retro style, few have noticed his nods to Godard and more recent filmmakers. He may seem to mimic early films with missing frames and soundtrack problems but these ""affectations"" are ultimately as expressive as the equivalent jump cuts and soundtrack dropouts in Godard's ""Alphaville."" They're richer too because of the inevitable multiple associations. His amazing short, ""Heart of the World"" (one of the best shorts I've ever seen) owes as much to modern MTV editing styles as it does to early Soviet cinema (and creates a bridge and dialogue between two seemingly unrelated creative eras). Guy's not an artsy filmmaker, he's just a ""guy"" who loves movies passionately and works, unselfconsciously, with film's full lexicon.

""Careful"" is a beautiful (often breathtakingly gorgeous), complex, unique, and very funny film. He's made a disturbing comedy about tragic and sensitive issues or maybe a tragedy about comic issues--there's something almost Shakespearean about his output. He also has a knack for getting memorable performances from his actors.

No this film isn't for everyone--right now at least--but I'm convinced we are currently witnessing the appearance of one of film's truly great creative geniuses. His films make one realize how stunningly shallow so many modern movies are, overburdened with flashy technologies like CGI, mandatory pop-cultural references, pretty people, and consumerism. His output is also a challenge to the equally bankrupt ""underground"" or ""counter-culture."" By avoiding every modern clich&eacute;, trend, anti-trend, technology, anti-technology, and pretense in his work he's giving us, in this film and others, timeless and (a rare thing these days) sublime works that are, even after all this lofty commentary, still pretty damned funny!",1081814400,23,2236,5.331444759206799
768578,2,630405033X,"Interesting looking, but mostly dull art film. What I gather that the filmmakers are trying to convey - from the title and the movie - is that incest runs rampant - and if it were brought into the open - would cause a metaphorical societal avalanch.

But its not easy to sit though this very slow moving, harebrained film for that message. I found this expensive looking purposely choppy film's acting, color photography, story, characters, dialogue dubbing and sound effects to be grossly arty, annoying and not to compelling or funny (goofy does not equal funny)...although I will say there were a few Lynchian style jokes that were mildly amusing.

As for an original art film? - Pop psychology, extensive symbolism, intentional camp,  and sets that imitate German expressionism have already been done ...ad-nauseum. What is original here is that the director chose to parody the style and mood of European mountain climbing films. Frankly I've never watched an entire one of these but let it be clear that European mountain climbing films are extremely esoteric.

There have been number of professional filmmakers in the last ten years or so who go to great lengths to make expensive films look like student art and amateur productions.  This is one of those films.

I don't think I'd recommend Careful for film students - because this is the type of film you hope they'ed grow past.

Without being able to recommend Careful to the average Joe film goer - Id still give Careful four stars in that - the technical people such as set designers, photographers, film and sound editors were obviously talented and meticulous about their craft. Also that the producers and the director had the nerve, talent, gall or perseverance to capture their vision on celluloid. But I take away two stars in that Careful really is just another example of an deliberate attempt to recreate and blow up a ten minute student art film into an hour and a half feature.

By the way - did I read the end credits right? Is this the kind of thing Canadians are spending their tax dollars on?  Silly use of your hard earned money.

The quality of the film stock, sound and extras provided by Kino Video are excellent.",1072396800,5,2194,4.78042328042328
768579,4,630405033X,"One of Guy Maddin's best-known films, Careful is naturally, extremely bizarre.  The inhabitants of a mountain village must be careful not to make a noise loud enough to trigger an avalanche, which would bury them all.  Naturally ther are all repressed, sexually as well as literally.
The film is often very funny, with great lines of dialogue such as ""here is all the hair I've lost in the past few weeks.""  Even the Oedipal elements are so melodramatic they're pretty chuckly.  The colour scheme is pretty painful on the eyes, and often irritating, but it does make the film what it is.",1050019200,3,587,4.7254901960784315
768580,3,630405033X,"Great sets & costumes, like a beautifully odd dream.  But it is slow and there's no reason to care for any of these characters, so I lost interest.

768581,5,630405033X,"I didn't know what to expect when I saw this film for the first time at an obsure Indy Film night at a small movie house. Upon first glance I thought it was quirky...but a little slow. For some reason I wasn't able to pull myself away. I was mezmerized as if in a quiet trance...my eyes glued to the screen, my heart racing with each disturbing scene as they unfolded to paint one of the most beautifully bizarre films I've seen.
I'm reluctant to recommend this film to too many people...not for the weak stomached...definately for the fan of the obscure.",1019001600,4,555,4.450980392156863
768582,4,630405033X,"When I first saw this film at a special screening at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the host described Guy Maddin as ""Winnipeg's answer to David Lynch... that is, if David Lynch were as good as Guy Maddin."" The praise might be just: there are lovely dreamlike effects in Maddin's film (especially this, one of his best) which are like nothing David Lynch ever achieved.
CAREFUL is a tribute to the great bergenfilms of the Weimar Republic, and is filmed with the same kinds of filmic effects and film stock as those lovely little hallucinations of the silent era. The film is largely about the joys of repression, and what disasters can be brought about without it. If you think I'm being facetious, you're wrong: in Maddin's deliriously offkilter Expressionist universe, every act of curiosity is sure to kill a cat, and everyone else besides.(the film's prologue, which explains all this, is one of the funniest things I've ever seen: ""Careful, don't touch that pot!"") Maddin's muse, the very gifted Kyle McCulloch, is on-hand as usual. This film can't be explained, but it also shouldn't be missed.",1014508800,15,1108,4.898936170212766
768583,3,630405033X,"If you're a cult cinema nut or a film student, you'll probably get all the jokes.  I did.  But this cross of incest and German mountain-climber movies of the twenties and thirties, while it certainly carries a unique visual style, just doesn't hold your interest.
I get the feeling that Maddin, unlike, say, fellow Canadian David Cronenberg, is straining to be weird and obscure.  This was worth the three bucks I paid to see it, in my opinion, it was fun.  But a classic?  No, and I wouldn't pay a lot for it either.  Kino has Jan Svankmajer's ""Conspirators of Pleasure"", as well, and THAT is most definitely a classic!",998352000,7,620,4.590909090909091
768584,5,630405033X,"This is a visually gorgeous movie that seriously altered the way in which I think of cinema and my expectations for future films.
Narrative:
Maddin starts the film off with a Narrator-figure that relates moralistic warnings from a stage while the film switches back and forth to quick stories of what happens to those that fail to heed these societal norms. The movie has a folklorist atmosphere during this beginning and the viewer may feel like they are witnessing a documentary of an earlier time unfolding before their eyes. I noticed some borrowings from the surrealists and German Expressionism--while my friend Adam pointed out to me how Eisenstein's theory of montage was also (ab)used.
History:
As with many experimental films, ""Careful"" causes us to question how societal narratives are constructed. The early moral warnings, the familial relations, class structures and societal conventions are completely naturalized for the characters of the film (and also the viewer)--but we keep noticing cracks in these naturalized relations/customs even before the ""second part"" enfolds a series of trials/absurdities.
Temporality:
Maddin also does a wonderful job of creating a film that seems to be a product of a much earlier period--I remember at one point during the movie leaning over and asking when the film was made. I was shocked to find out that it was indeed a contemporary film.  -----------------  Of course this is a very simplistic analysis of this film--I must view it again before ever hoping to fully appreciate it.  I highly recommend this film and look forward to accessing his other works.

768585,4,630405033X,"Will wonders never cease? Here is a DVD that I never thought I'd see. Guy Maddin's brilliant and hilarious (particularly for early film buffs) `Careful.' The plot and style of this film have been well explained by other commentaries on this page and elsewhere, so there's no need to go over it again. My favorite comment about it is that it is like a Ricola ad gone horribly, horribly wrong. Suffice it to say that the DVD is an improvement in image quality. While many of the images are intentionally vague, grainy or indistinct by the choice of the filmmakers, I get the impression that these effects are more clearly conveyed in the DVD. In a spoken commentary track with Maddin and screenwriter George Toles (new to this DVD, and obviously not possible on the VHS edition), Maddin admits that he wanted to add an effect through use of the color controls during the digital transfer, but resisted that temptation in order to let this DVD stand as a faithful representation of the film. While the effect he had in mind might have been interesting, I'm still grateful to him for his restraint.
Maddin claims in his commentary that people often obliquely criticize the performances of the actors in this film while, at the same time, telling him how much they like it, placing him in the position of defending those performances. Maddin states that he absolutely stands by the performances in this film, and that the actors gave him precisely what he asked for. This should dispel any doubts among people who see this film about the unusual, stiff delivery of lines, which might lead people who know nothing about the cast to suspect they are amateurs, which they are definitely not. This sort of line reading can be seen in some of the very earliest talkies. The antiquated sound of this film, along with its look, is all of a piece, and completely intentional, right down to the fake patina of noise added to the mono soundtrack. Maddin does regret some of the props and effects which had to be done on the cheap, due to budget restraints. Who knows how much more bizarre and fantastic it might have looked with a larger budget? On the other hand, it might have lost some of its unique charm. As it is, it's a wonderful piece of work that I find unforgettable, and that has remained vivid in my memory years after first seeing it. Copies of this DVD aren't to be found in abundance, and I don't know how long it will stay in print. If you like this film, do get this DVD now, and tell anyone you know who likes unusual films about it.
Near the end of the film, which hints at a continuation of the story, Maddin says that he may make that sequel some day. I don't know if he was serious about it or not, but I'd sure love to see it.",972259200,12,2734,4.480961923847695
768586,5,630405033X,"Once in a long while, moviegoers are treated to a wholly new style of film making... directorially, cinematographically, etc.  In the 1940s, it was  Welles and Toland teaming up to make Kane, a film packed with more  innovations than any before or since.  In the 1950s and 60s, it was  Kubrick, evolving from the noir to surrealistic, and his unique eye.  The  newest great celluloid genius is Guy Maddin, and ""Careful"", while  largely derivative of early directors' work (e.g., Wiene, Murnau, etc.), is  the most brilliant of his masterpieces.  With cardboard and billowing  sheets, Maddin creates the 19th century village of Tolzbad, where steep  mountains loom as large as repressed sexual urges.  The villagers live in  constant fear of triggering avalanches; everyone speaks in hushed tones,  babies are taught not to cry and the larynxes of animals are severed.  Yet  the mania for caution goes far deeper than sounds.  A surrealistic,  otherworldly melodrama, ""Careful"" is a story of ill-fated lovers,  taboos, obsession, inhibition and the explosion in which this volatile  mixture erupts.  Not since David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"" have we  seen such unique vision and technical prowess in experimental cinema.",966297600,3,1214,5.306878306878307
