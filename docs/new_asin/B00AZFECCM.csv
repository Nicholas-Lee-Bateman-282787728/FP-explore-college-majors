5529092,5,B00AZFECCM,"No Way Out But One is by far the best documentary I've ever seen. In fact, I've watched it three times and can't wait to see it two more times at the April 27 conference ""National Scandal: Family Courts Give Children to Identified Pedophiles"" in Davis, CA  [...] and at the May 10-12 Battered Mothers Custody Conference in Washington DC [...].

No Way Out But One describes the impossible Catch 22 confronted by mothers trying to protect their children in family (divorce) courts across the nation. The system fails children who report parental abuse in a way that defies belief.  Garland Waller captured the nearly impossible conundrum of the Collins family and wove it into a beautifully filmed story of hope and triumph.",1364428800,15,723,4.861788617886178
5529093,5,B00AZFECCM,"""No Way Out But One"" completely opened my eyes to an issue within the American courts systems that I had no idea existed. After viewing the film at Boston University, I was not only stunned, but angered and saddened with Holly's story. How could our courts and judges be so unjust and unfair, that they would drive a mother to kidnap her own children? How can a court that is designed to protect children, turn them over to their abusers? These are only a few of the questions that this film poses to its viewers.  We are told time and time again that America is the best nation is the world, but this film exposes the harsh reality of the flaws within our judicial system. Waller beautifully tells Holly's story, but more importantly she unearths the root of the issue that leaves viewers with a desire to take a stand. This is not a film that you can walk away from unchanged, it will haunt you in the best of ways.",1364428800,5,917,4.362573099415204
5529094,5,B00AZFECCM,"The United States has saved thousands of people by providing assylum for people from countries where it would be unsafe for them to return.  So why would an American woman and her children need asylum?  In the case of Holly Collins in an award winning film by Garland Waller and Barry Nolan it was because of a broken custody system where the safety of children was and is far from the first priority of the court.  The court knew that the father was so abusive he had fractured the skull of the young son, Zachary.  The judge gave the father custody anyway believing the allegations of alienation, which is a standard abuser tactic all too successful in our broken court system was more important than the father's well documented domestic violence and child abuse.  As often happens in what a recent research study released by the US Department of Justice refers to as cases with harmful outcomes, the safe protective mother was limited to supervised visitation.  During the visitation, the daughter, Jennifer would lift up her shirt to show the bruises from her father's beatings.  The supervisors told her that she could no longer talk about this and if she did not stop she would not be allowed to see her mother.  This part of the story is all too common in the broken custody court system.  If you are not familiar with these common tragedies it is because the courts are silencing its victims and the media has failed with a few exceptions to cover the scandal.

This film is a must see for anyone who cares about children and loves this country. You will be glued to the screen.  You will laugh and you will cry and then I hope you will go out and support the work of Holly, Jennifer, Zachary and all the protective mothers and their supporters seeking to make our family courts safe for children.",1364428800,8,1806,4.595015576323988
5529095,5,B00AZFECCM,"As a parent, have you ever considered what you would do if you found out your child was being abused and the Court didn""t believe you. Have you ever imagined just what steps you would take and how far you would go to protect your child ? Well, Holly Collins had to consider, imagine and act on her own to protect her kids.

Today, her story is being told by two award winning journalists, Barry Nolan and Garland Waller. This husband and wife team go behind the newspaper headlines into the heart of one of the most remarkable cases in American Jurisprudence. You will see in riveting detail the heroism of a protective mother, the chaos of children's lives as they are pursued by police and FBI agents. You will experience the heart of a warrior woman lawyer who takes on systemic court abuse and prevails. Most importantly you will be amazed by Holly Collins and the ferocity of her instincts to protect her children.

""No Way Out But One"" is not only a masterpiece because of it's story, but also it is a masterpiece in it's telling.",1364428800,4,1036,4.50531914893617
5529096,5,B00AZFECCM,"It was very informative, and unfortunately it is exactly what is happening in the Palmer, Alaska court system.  But not only there, it is really happening all over the country.  The courts in Palmer, Alaska are returning children to their abusers just like in this film.  They will prosecute a mother for keeping her children safe!  Thank you for this movie.",1367280000,3,358,4.819672131147541
5529097,5,B00AZFECCM,"This is a powerful and important story.  Holly Collins has all sorts of medical and eye witness evidence that the children's father and step mother are physically abusive and even cracked the boy's skull.  The children are terrified, but no one in the family court cares about that, and they don't even bother to look at the evidence.  There are no consequences for the family court appointees who lie and/or refuse to look at the evidence.

Thank goodness this mom manages to escape to the Netherlands with her children, where officials take the time to look at the evidence, and even take a new MRI of the boy's skull, which corroborates the abuse, and motivates the Dutch people to grant asylum to the family.

This is a story not just of Holly and her children's courage, but is also the story of the broken Family Court system, which is putting children into the hands of their identified abusers every day.  Hopefully this film and others like it will make people understand that the family court system needs to be changed, and that this is URGENT.",1367107200,6,1055,4.675675675675675
5529098,4,B00AZFECCM,"""No Way Out But One"" (2011 release; 89 min.) originally came out about 18 months ago, pretty much having been financed through Kickstarter and then self-released by the writers-directors-producers Barry Nolan and Garland Waller. It recently has been re-released by the folks at Passion River.

The documentary brings the story of how Holly Ann Collins and her two young children are living in the early 1990s in abuse from the husband/father. For reasons that are being explained painstakingly in the movie, it is apparently the case in the US justice system that when one parent alleges abusive behavior against the other, the abusing parent will usually counter-allege with ""Parental Alienation Syndrom"" (in lay-man terms: that the mother is coaching her kids to not want to spend time with the abusive father), and that abusing parent usually will win. So too in this case, and the Minnesota family court, despite ample evidence of physical abuse, awards full custody of the kids to the abusing father. Holly Ann does not see an end to this, and decides to flee with her young kids, eventually ending up in the Netherlands. To tell you more of the story would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, as is the case with these types of documentaries, you will be disgusted and enraged with this miscarriage of justice in our court system (other such recent documentaries: West of Memphis; The Central Park Five; Crime After Crime). The best part of the documentary is when Holly Ann and her kids are on the run, and she brings us the hair-raising tales of their underground run. Holly Ann and her now-grown up kids (17 years after they fled the US) are interviewed extensively, as are family and friends. Not surprisingly, the abusive father refused to cooperate. I must also say that the documentary is made on a nickel and a dime (through Kickstarter) and it feels and looks like a B documentary (compare this for example with the A grade feel of West of Memphis or The Central Park Five). Thad said, the documentary brings a compelling story that deserves to be heard by a wide audience.",1366761600,8,2180,4.841823056300268
5529099,5,B00AZFECCM,"Like Holly Collins, I sought to protect my children from abuse. Unlike Holly, I remained in the United States and I followed all of the court's orders. My abusive ex-husband was awarded full custody of our two minor children in November 1998. My children never came home again. What happened to me and my children substantiates that Holly truly had no way out but one. For anyone who might wonder if Holly could have stayed in the U.S. and protected her children somehow, I'm living proof she could not. What Holly did took enormous strength and courage. She had perseverance against all odds. In my opinion, every person who views this documentary will realize once and for all that something is terribly wrong in America's family court system. Barry Nolan and Garland Waller managed to capture a very lucid 'snapshot' of an injustice that's unthinkable. Even though I've lived without my children for the past 15 years and know firsthand that there is no way out but one, I soaked up this film as if I'd never heard of anything like Holly's story or my story. Beyond excellent! I wish I could rate it 10 stars.",1366070400,13,1112,4.678571428571429
5529100,5,B00AZFECCM,"Garland Waller and Barry Nolan have done a wonderful job telling a story that too few people know. Not only the story of Holly Collins and her children, but the story of countless families where biased Family Court judges have failed to give credence to the testimony of abused women and their children. Ms. Waller tells the story with compassion, insight and a commitment to seeking the truth that illuminates a major social problem. Prof. Michael Avery, Suffolk Law School",1365292800,6,474,4.9375
5529101,5,B00AZFECCM,"No Way Out But One is an incredible look into our reality that 53,000 children a year face, and nobody else wants to look at, children being taken away from a protective parent and placed with an abuser.  This number is more than twice that of children being stricken with cancer each year.

This film beautiful encapsulates the journey of a protective mother who would do anything for her children when the system that was designed to protect children not only turned their backs to them, but blamed the voice of truth to ignore the ugly truth of abuse.

At a screening last year in Marin, we heard from the director and producer about this crisis across America.  This is the current civil rights pandemic and NWOBO is bringing this issue to the forefront.  Watch this, share this and be a part of a change for children and families to find a safe way out!  See why we should all believe the child!",1364860800,6,900,4.49079754601227
5529102,5,B00AZFECCM,"I watched No Way Out But One for the first time at a screening at Boston University two years ago. The film's story of compassion, persistance, and maternal love has stuck with me since. The film is extremely well done, and Holly's story is told beautifully and poetically.

5529105,5,B00AZFECCM,"This true story holds the same pattern worldwide with secret family courts awarding custody to known abusers and domestic terrorists.

This story is almost identical to my own and millions of protective mothers worldwide.

The pattern is always the same, so much so that one can pre write the script for any DV and child abuse divorce case.

In Ireland we have solicitors warning protective mothers not to dare mention DV and child abuse to the judge lest they loose custody because judges do not want to hear about DV and child abuse.

I salute all involved in exposing this truth at this time.",1364515200,4,595,4.6923076923076925
8559598,5,B00AZFECCM,"The American family court system is a medieval institution whose one and only priority is a father's dominion over his wife and children, no matter how horrifically he abuses them. Mothers and children who dare to attempt to escape their abusers are hunted down and imprisoned.

The United States is truly the worst country in the world for women and children. Notably, it is one of the only countries on the planet that has not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child or the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

This account of a protective mother thwarted at every turn while trying to save her children from a dangerous father is alarming and informative. With only one possibility to save the very lives of her children and to return them to childhood she escaped the U.S. and sought asylum in Europe till her children were of age. This DVD should be bought in mass and given out to as many as possible. The system is in serious need of change.",1369267200,2,537,4.489795918367347
8559607,5,B00AZFECCM,"This documentary went straight to the core of the problems in our judicial branch of government for family law.  Unfortunately, many judges do not consider domestic violence to be a deciding factor in child visitation. This documentary shows the realistic problems when the judicial system fails the children.  This Mother's courage is demonstrated daily in America.  When a Mother has to deliver their children to an abuser it takes a super human amount of courage to do so, knowing that some other person decided for you the care of your children; whom doesn't know the family and doesn't care.  I recommend this documentary for every Domestic Violence Agency, for every Mother considering a custody hearing, and  for every Conciliatory Court in America to view as strongly as I would a research article.  This is America's dirty little secret.................how badly we treat women and children in our country.",1367280000,3,915,5.190476190476191
