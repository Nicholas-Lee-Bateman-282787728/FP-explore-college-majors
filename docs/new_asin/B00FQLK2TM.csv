6020180,2,B00FQLK2TM,"I was expecting to really like this but I was pretty disappointed.  It was a good idea, I liked the actors and the acting, and some of the scenes and lines, but the script just didn't hold together overall.  I just didn't find any real chemistry where there was supposed to be and the relationship just didn't really seem plausible to me.  The main male characters didn't really make sense to me...",1422144000,6,398,4.5
6020181,3,B00FQLK2TM,"Overall an okay Indie movie. I watched it because I saw it had Karen Gillan from Doctor Who and surprisingly wasn't all that impressed with her performance (although that could be due to poor script). As previous reviews have mentioned it was hard to feel  any sympathy or connection with the characters, mainly because they rushed the first 30 min of the movie, and the story line was at times unbelievable. I debated stopping about 20 min in, but I kept going and I'll say the second half is definitely better than the first. There is just enough chemistry between the two leads to make it watchable.",1421452800,5,602,4.626168224299065
6020182,5,B00FQLK2TM,"*light spoilers*
I got my first taste of the quirky, adorable, and funny Karen Gillian via the TV show, Selfie. She is a breath of fresh air for young actresses and that is the primary reason I chose to watch this movie. The second reason was because it is about a young novelist/writer and love any type of movie about writing. She is haunted by the absence of her parents and has worked through it to create something she hopes to share with the world. The underlying love plot gives the story more 'meat' as the two first work together to put out her first novel. The movie is clever, doesn't simply circle around the love story and delves into how an artistic soul, like a writer, will use their writing to mend their wounds, seeking a way to heal. I very much enjoyed this and will be watching again.",1421193600,19,805,4.373333333333333
6020183,2,B00FQLK2TM,"I forgot how this movie came to my attention, but I was anticipating its release for a very long time.
Now that I've seen it...
Is there a conspiracy?
Did the movie creators pay a whole bunch of people to write good reviews here and on IMDB?
Or am I fundamentally misunderstanding something?
On what level is this a good movie?
It looks like a  high schooler's project.
Albeit with a good budget, that is.. They even got a B-list actor (Henry Ian Cusick of the Lost fame) to play a supporting role.
But that's where the good part ends.
Now with the bad:
The characters are flat and undeveloped.
The acting is ... ugh.
All the way through the end of the movie I was wondering why it is that I should care about any of the characters.
The script and its execution are both awful.
The plot holes and omissions are many.. A struggling writer has a nice apartment in Glasgow and a country house?
And even though she eventually writes her first breakthrough book, the whole story of her eventual success is very unconvincing.

I am quoting excerpts from an IMDB review by rosiemary2009, who expressed my thoughts almost word for word:
"" [...]
2. [T]he infuriating woman dressed as a 60s prostitute who does nothing to contribute to the film but sits in on every scene exposing her boobs
[...]
4. [T]he male protagonist cannot seem to decide his origin - have difficulty deciding if he is of Scottish, Indian or French descent due to his appalling acting
5. [T]he background music sounds like its been composed by a Scottish 10 year old boy band
[...]
10. A tragic attempt at comedy at the end fails miserably when it appears our hero has keeled over from a tragic case of 3 minute pneumonia""

Two stars for trying, seeing as it's an indie movie. If it were a Hollywood flick, I'd give it zero stars..",1420848000,12,1794,4.463414634146342
6020184,5,B00FQLK2TM,Loved this Movie! Light and airy no hidden agenda. Great character interaction! Want be disappointed!,1420675200,,101,5.8
6020185,5,B00FQLK2TM,"Although it took me about 15 minutes to really get into it, I ended up loving it.  Jane and Tom, both obviously emotionally stunted, were wonderful.  I found myself laughing even in the darkest parts.

The surrounding cast of characters provided support in a way that made me smile.  Roddy, the English teacher, served as Tom's conscience.  Often questioning Tom's actions, but inevitably going along with the plan.  Darcy, spurring Jane on to the truth, was alway there when Jane needed her (even if she wasn't wanted).

All in all, this movie deals with the pain that so many people live with every day in a way that leaves you feeling that you will get through it.  Whether it's feelings of abandonment or rejection, there is always the chance for a happy ending.",1419120000,,766,4.706766917293233

Movie was delivered in 10 days instead of the 4-6 weeks Amazon said it would take.  I Love Shopping on Amazon.com",1408060800,6,279,4.226415094339623

6020196,3,B00FQLK2TM,"This movie was quirky, at times sweet, and sometimes just cringeworthy. (Talking to you, screenwriter schmuck character, who seems way too old and creepy for the romantic pairing to make any sense.) Though the premise was cute, the script was kind of emotionally all over the place and lacked commitment to any real depth. The ""sidekick"" character, a high school English teacher who routinely gives his students preposterous and historically impossible factoids, provided some good comic moments. I don't care about predictability, I knew what I was signing up for, however, I could do with fewer holes in the plot. I have no want to rewatch this movie, but it was an alright piece of Tuesday night entertainment.",1520899200,,713,5.0508474576271185

6020198,3,B00FQLK2TM,"Cute movie, not over the top!  Don't over think it, just enjoy.  Light romantic comedy that didn't drag on.  Fun to see several actors who have all performed in OUTLANDER, the Starz series, but not together as in this movie.  Acting lifts the script!",1520640000,,250,4.613636363636363
6020199,4,B00FQLK2TM,"Funny, charming, more depth than your average rom-com. I liked it a lot! There is, in fact, another happy ending, but I'll overlook that. The acting is great, and the story flows effortlessly.",1520035200,,192,4.848484848484849
6020200,1,B00FQLK2TM,"The real star of this movie was the hair.  Honestly, is there a man alive who has better hair than Stanley Weber?  And those bangs on Karen Gillan were a non-stop distraction.

The main premise of the story was terrible.  The hero had a terrible temper, went out of his way to be cruel to the heroine, and displayed some pretty terrible stalker behavior.  No matter how handsome he was there was no getting past these red flags, and she should have ended up with the competition.

Also, I'm not sure why they made the decision to occasionally have Stanley Weber speak with a bad Scots accent?  He's 100% French and it would have been just fine for the story line to keep him French, instead of having a confusing thrown in back story of college in France.  He's a very good actor, but I think he's too dark and intense for a romantic comedy.",1516147200,,841,4.380645161290323
6020201,4,B00FQLK2TM,"It's cute and enjoyable, but the Scottish and French accents are difficult to understand.  I watch Masterpiece Theatre on PBS, but these accents are not those of the actors on BBC and PBS productions. Thank goodness for closed captions.

I wish Amazon did a better job at movie descriptions and noting if they are foreign or not, the genre, etc.  I found this using a streaming device, through the Amazon app.

One fun item - there's an actor in this who is in Marvel's ""Agents of Shield.""",1514764800,,489,4.586206896551724

6020206,1,B00FQLK2TM,"Acting is cheesy, ending predictable and overall isn't even funny. The male lead is a mean-spirited and emotionally juvenile boss and and sadly, he turns to out to be the swoon-over lover boy. The male woman is a push over who can't get her life together. Honestly, this movie was a waste of time. Acting is mediocre at best.",1501891200,5,325,4.52542372881356

6020210,5,B00FQLK2TM,"This was a totally fun movie about the magic and sheer torture of falling in love. Being a writer, I loved the hilarious writer's block sub-plot and how the author's real life drama played into her ability to writer or not. A refreshing love story. (For those who care, there is a little bit of nudity, which is completely non-sexual. There's also some cursing. But it's minimal.)",1497916800,,380,4.686567164179104
6020211,5,B00FQLK2TM,"Everything about this film was top-notch, in my estimation. I found the plot flowed so perfectly from the characters that I felt I was being carried along while looking into their their personal lives. This is a great girls' night in flick, but there's nothing too overly sentimental to send the guys running out of the room. For me, this is a Five Star film, and I'll most definitely be back to watch it again. (Good music, acting, and I adored the costuming!)",1497830400,,461,4.566265060240964
6020212,5,B00FQLK2TM,we absolutely enjoyed this.  Honest and funny without taking itself too seriously.. Fast paced and with many unexpected moments and turns.,1496966400,,138,5.571428571428571

6020214,3,B00FQLK2TM,"Like the angsty pre-teen playlist the film was scored with, ""Not Another Happy Ending"" is weighed down with too many emotions and a noticeable identity complex.",1494806400,,160,5.1923076923076925
6020215,5,B00FQLK2TM,I loved this movie. It was refreshing and though low key hit a few high notes in the process. It was well written and the movie flowed well from plot point to plot point. I think my favorite part was the acting and actors. There were a lot of real moments in this movie and moments that draw you through a maze of emotions. I especially loved the ending. I've loved Karen Gillan since I was first introduced to her in doctor who. The other players in this movie were we'll matched... and truthfully probably just as famous in the European scene and I'm just not familiar with them. Either way it was a fantastic movie and I highly recommend it.,1494633600,,644,4.330578512396694

6020217,5,B00FQLK2TM,So nicely understated acted. This exactly what a movie without premonitions should work like.,1493596800,,93,5.714285714285714
6020218,1,B00FQLK2TM,"Where do I even start? The beginning of the film is so rushed. You never get to emotionally connect with any of the characters because all the important character development is thrown away in a big montage way too early in the movie. And some of the major characters are introduced so poorly, that you can't really even invest in them or the relationships either.

And this movie also struggles with an identity crisis. It can't settle between a romantic comedy or a quirky independent film about writing, so it fails to nail on either. This makes things like sappy rom-com hijynx feel out of place, and glosses over everything about writer's block and the creative process.

And curiously, why is this product description written about the pusblisher's character when the main character of this movie is clearly the author?",1492905600,6,825,4.885714285714286
6020219,2,B00FQLK2TM,"This movie was really hard to watch. I really liked Karen Gillan from Selfie, but she is wasted here. Stanley Weber is a painful romantic love interest. I can see how in certain light he is ruggedly handsome, but his performance was cringeworthy. The chemistry between the two leads was forced and contrived. I have a sense of what the director was TRYING to achieve with this movie, but it repeatedly fell short of endearing, charming, witty, playful . . . I normally find Amazon reviews to be accurate, but this movie definitely did not deserve 4 stars. I only recommend if you need to have something on in the background.",1492473600,3,624,4.63063063063063
6020220,4,B00FQLK2TM,"I wanted to watch something easy to follow, saw the trailer for this, and thought I'd give it a try. It is actually a good movie! Not light, but definitely not overdramatic like other films. Great to watch at home alone, significant other, or family. It was nice to see a Scottish film in modern times (no kilts  or Braveheart type involved), the scenery was great. The time passed by quickly when watching it. If you're a parent: I would say PG-13 because of 2 specific scenes (very short) although some American TV series for teens show more than this film.

I experienced all emotions I can think of in the first half hour. I was happy, sad, angry. It was amazing.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who has a love for movies that seem real.

You know it just reminds me of one of those movies that the idea was good and sparks your interest, just didn't go QUITE far enough....just on the boarder line.  Some may like that...makes it more real life and less Hollywood.  I personally like the over the to Hollywood.  Basic bottomline:  You won't get bored and you will enjoy the characters and you will be touched once or twice.  It's ok for a rainy afternoon when you just want to veg out with a movie, but it's nothing you will fall in love with or will fill the need to see again.",1487376000,,574,4.367924528301887

6020268,5,B00FQLK2TM,"As a teacher of literature and writing, I tend to have standards that are rarely satisfied by contemporary films. This little gem is lovely.  It offers excellent comedy as well as perceptive examination of human motivations. I loved the clever exploration of the art of novel-writing.  Yes, to an extent it's a rom-com, but it's at the top of the genre.  Well worth watching.  In fact, I first saw it a year ago, and it was equally good upon a second viewing.",1484438400,3,459,4.560975609756097

6020270,5,B00FQLK2TM,"I adore this film. I found the characters lovable and the story warm and delightful. It is a fun one to watch...because while much of it is not plausible if you are sassy and a romantic you will find it to be like comfort food. The story pokes fun at the writer's struggle in a very cute way that I found quite entertaining. There is just the right amount of tension between characters. Yes, ending is kind of surreal, but it is not a documentary...this is a story. This story is based on the idea that the writer and the romantic (even those trying not to be) are always wrestling match over that magical thing called the ""happy ending."" If you get that then you may enjoy this.",1484352000,9,679,4.3125
6020271,5,B00FQLK2TM,"Wonderfully acted with a bittersweet plot line that was laugh out loud funny at times.

I liked all the characters but her and her dad really stood out above the rest in reaching into my heart and grabbing it.

This movie was a sudsy representation of writers and publishing that was embarrassingly unreal.  One line, ""Does 'deprivation' have one p or two?""

6020376,5,B00FQLK2TM,"This the first film that I watched with Karen Gillian, who the main star of the film and who portrays Jane Lockhart. Karen Gillian has the it star quality, her charisma just bubbles over drowning you with delightful glee. Oh those big expressive eyes and that charming personality. Ok, I admit it I fell for her, I just love everything about her. Her smile, her voice, her wonderful giggle. I don't know if it's the Jane Lockhart character or the way that Gillian portrays her. Gillian plays a successful novelist who has writer's block for her second novel. She has a love affair with a screenplay writer and a interesting humorous relationship with her handsome male publisher. The story is endearing and Gillian's sparkling effervesce lights the screen up every scene she appears in. She certainly has the  essence of star power, I hope to see more of her on the big silver screen.",1426464000,,884,4.740259740259741

6020384,5,B00FQLK2TM,I enjoyed this movie bunches. Even stayed up until 3 am to finish watching it and i didn't mention that i have little kids~ so staying up late is a big deal in my house. The main characters and the story line is just beautiful.  I did enjoy the Scottish accents by the way...reminded me of Braveheart and Disney's The Brave. I laughed. I cried. Laughed again. And now my throat hurts from choking back tears. Rent this movie because you won't be disappointed. This is not another cheap predictable romance comedy story lines either. I'll rank This movie up with some of My other Romance favorites.,1424563200,3,597,4.579439252336448

6020389,4,B00FQLK2TM,"I'd say the best thing about this movie is the exploration of the girl's issues with her father. The pub quiz scene made the movie for me. Very poignant, and it's hard not to love a film that is quirky and more original than the typical romantic comedies that come out of Hollywood. Pretty good music, also!",1423958400,8,307,4.4035087719298245

6020393,1,B00FQLK2TM,"boring.  With in first 10 minutes the movies does a lil montage of the two main characters skipping around town, teasing each other w hAppy music in the background.  When that stops you are to believe they have fallen in love.  What really?  Stupid. Lost my interst immediately.  I did finish it only because I was occupied playing on my phone.",1423440000,,344,4.573770491803279

6020395,2,B00FQLK2TM,Not many dimensions to Karen Gillan's portrayal and her costumer had a tedious sense of what might be thought of as quirky author's clothing.  Easy to think that this writer couldn't write her way out of a paper sack.,1422748800,7,217,4.564102564102564
8617992,5,B00FQLK2TM,"Quirky, off-beat but delightfully believable romantic tale of how love and loss affect us, skew our thinking and make finding happy a challenge.  Enjoyed seeing the charming French actor Stanley Weber as a comedic lead holding his own when toe to toe with Karen Gillan.  Once again, as with ""Billy Elliott"", Gary Lewis portrays a father who has to step outside his comfort zone to redeem himself in the eyes of his child.",1531785600,,421,4.7534246575342465
8617993,4,B00FQLK2TM,"This romance is witty and funny. In the lead role, Karen Gillan is perfect from the beginning to the end.  The humor is ""adult-ish"" (not tittering), solid dialog and screenplay, and very entertaining.  Its well worth watching.",1529971200,,226,5.081081081081081

The dialog was so stiff and the characters just weren't endearing. Granted, the leading actor is a crazy, crazy beautiful man, and Karen Gillan is lovely, but even with the aid of two stunning leads, I could not make it through this movie. Yikes.",1528761600,,390,4.507042253521127

8617997,3,B00FQLK2TM,I am really annoyed that they changed the cover art. The first one with the full length shot of Karen gave it a feel of a girl looking for something and finding herself instead. The whole movie is about her writers block and a big part of it is fixing the broken relationship with her father. This new cover just turns it into a cliche Hollywood Rom-com which this isn't. I am disappointed in whoever decided upon this change.,1527465600,,426,4.405063291139241
