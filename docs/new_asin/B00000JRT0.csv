The sound and video quality is a total insult to any DVD owner that expects good quality for his/her investment. In this day and age of digital video and sound there is no excuse for over-marketing this trash. I have never watched it after my initial trial run.",1078358400,15,407,4.298701298701299
1238248,4,B00000JRT0,"First... All three of these shows  are wonderful, and should serve as a good lesson to aspiring musicians and singers just what it means to SOUND fantastic in concert, and leave the cheesy, flashy junk to the teenies.
Merle's voice is unreal, and his band is tight and right on the mark.
The camera angles, etc. really pull you in to the 'essence' of each show, and the audio is, in my opinion, CD quality and worthy of praise for a live recording..  very well done
.
A MUST HAVE FOR MERLE/COUNTRY FANS!!! PERIOD!
If you're looking for a Garth Brooks or Shania Twain glitz and glimmer Vegas-style concert.. look elsewhere. This is a songwriter and poet at work here, and the SONGS and the SINGER are the show.
Disappointing, however was the fact that the songlist on the back cover shows 'My Favorite Memory', which is not present...  Willie appears for ""Sing Me Back Home"", but the cover indicates that he also appears on 'Just Stay Here and Drink'.. which does not appear at all until the second episode/show (and, no Willie). I've viewed this on and off for a couple days.. and I either blinked, looked away, etc. but I did not see Mr. Paycheck at all.
There are other inconsistencies with what the back indicates, and what's really there, but it does NOT take away from what IS there. I was really looking forward to seeing what the cover SAYS is there, so a small bit of frustration was initially present.
I believe some editing took place after the packaging had already been finished.
If you're even CONSIDERING this item (which you obviously are, or you wouldn't be reading this).. JUST CLICK ""BUY"".. You'll love it!

1238249,5,B00000JRT0,"Don't know what the previous reviewer was looking for, but I LOVE this video. You get a glimpse of Merle in 3 different stages of his career. The first back in the '70's when Merle was the premier country act, evident by the fact Willie Nelson and Johnny Paycheck were opening acts and appear briefly on stage. The second is early/mid 80's and Merle has aged, but still sounds great singing ballad after ballad, and the third is a TNN concert special Merle did in the late 80's, still sounding great wether it be singing, playing his guitar, or playing the fiddle. I enjoyed it so much I'm considering buying a second copy as a backup.",1016409600,15,635,4.482758620689655
1238250,4,B00000JRT0,"i wasn't a merle haggard fan,my mother is, so i bought this dvd to make a tape for her, guess what?, i am now a merle haggard fan.the first two concerts are the best in my humble opinion, the first is a daylight concert in a stadium and the fans are jumping so hard in the upper section that the stadium got worried and asked the fans to please stop for their own safety! merle is younger at this concert.the second concert is great! close up camera work shows alot of feeling in his ballads!
remember,tapes will eventually wear out, dvd""s dont!! i collect rock,and rock and roll,but this dvd has become a permanent part of my collection.if you really like merle you are gonna like this!
only negative thing i can say is there doesn""t seem to be any johnny paycheck performance? this doesn""t bother me because i don't know anything about him anyway. danny.",989971200,11,856,4.493589743589744
1238251,5,B00000JRT0,I BOUGHT THIS DVD MONTHS AGO AND FIND IT TO BE VERY GOOD . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANY REAL HAG FAN . THOUGH THERE IS NOTHING FANCY ON HERE VISUALLY IT MAKES UP FOR IT WITH THE BEST COUNTRY SONGS EVER WRITTEN . IT'S  A GOOD ADDITION TO ANYBODYS COLLECTION OF REAL COUNTRY MUSIC .,955843200,7,282,3.9473684210526314

7913366,1,B00000JRT0,"i broke it coming out of the box, what can I say.  merle haggard is excellent to listen to.  My fault that i can't watch it",1401840000,,123,3.6923076923076925
7913367,4,B00000JRT0,"I don't know where anyone got the idea that this is a 3 DVD package, I ordered this and it came sealed and is a one (1) DVD concert and documentary.  The concert is a one hour concert at Church Street Station in Florida and the documentary is about an hour, which includes mostly information and photos seen before.  You can't possibly cover the history of Country Music in a one hour documentary.

As far as the quality of the concert, it is certainly not high definition, but about as good as you could get in the 80's, when this was recorded, nor is the sound stereo.",1387756800,,570,4.308411214953271
7913368,5,B00000JRT0,"I've watched this a hundred times easily. Sure the video/audio isn't perfect, it's pretty generic. The shows are stellar. Especially the Concord pavillion. When was this 1985 or so? Merle's voice was in full maturity and on the slow tunes like: ""Mama's Hungry Eyes"" ""Kern River"" and ""If I Could Only Fly"" his singing will send shivers down your spine.",1383868800,,351,4.866666666666666

7913370,2,B00000JRT0,Many of Mr. Haggard's DVD's bless my lybrary. The decision to order this NEW Merle Haggard DVD set and to find it contained the identical sessions that have been in my DVD lybrary for years was shocking.  Retuning this DVD set to Amazon for credit was dissappointing as the credit allowed was less than twenty five percent of the original Amazon billing.,1306022400,3,354,4.709677419354839
7913371,4,B00000JRT0,"First of all, I don't have any other releases to compare this DVD to, so I can't say what's ""missing"" compared to other releases, or how the sound quality compares, etc etc etc.
All I can say is, as a longtime Merle Haggard fan, he has NEVER disappointed me and this DVD is no exception. Three concerts, recorded over the span of about 15 years, showcasing nearly all of Merle's best known songs as well as his takes on the standards (Bob Wills, Jimmie Rodgers, etc). His band kicks and smokes and swings, same as ever... and Merle is in fine voice on all three sets.
Saying there might be ""better"" Haggard concert discs out there, to me, is like saying there might be ""better"" Van Goghs or Picassos than the ones on show at your nearest museum or gallery. Maybe so, but when you're dealing with that level of talent, it's all relative. Three Merle concerts on one DVD... why quibble??",1262217600,,885,4.469135802469136
7913372,2,B00000JRT0,Is it just my copy that has the picture quality so horrible?  I could not believe it.  The sound is great but the picture is not clear.  Please let me know if that is the way your copies are!,1220659200,5,191,3.8461538461538463
7913373,2,B00000JRT0,"If you are expecting Merle Haggard to sing his hit songs in the same tempo and lyrics of the original releases then this DVD is not for you. The songs on this DVD, which contains 3 concerts in one, are are at a much slower tempo. Further, many of the songs are not sung to the same words as the originals and not complete versions.

Very disappointing overall. Only buy if you are a ardent Hagard fan. Only worth 2 stars.",1109980800,3,421,4.197530864197531
