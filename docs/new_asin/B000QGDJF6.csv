2838826,3,B000QGDJF6,"This film is a cross between ""Monk"" and ""The X Files"". Fiennes is intense and quirky, but Ryder can't decide whether to be caustic or attracted to her partner, and her character has little depth. Truly, the movie comes off as a collection of episodes from a TV show ( a promising TV show).

The technical premise of the film, that of discovering predictive attributes for people who die from stupidity, is largely left ignored, despite offering the only dramatic continuity to the plot. What's left is the characters from the deaths being investigated, and the characters of the investigators. Potential dramatic opportunities of tension with the insurance company, or meaningful interactions with the survivors, are simply absent. There is no attempt to tie the actual Darwin Awards to the deaths.

The result is cute, and, thanks to Fiennes, amusing. But it doesn't feel like a feature film.",1186272000,3,893,5.027027027027027
2838827,4,B000QGDJF6,"This was a very underpromoted movie that could have done quite well in the box office, but will likely do well as a cult classic.  An ex police investigator and an insurance investigator are paired together after a series of misfortunes, and they are sent on a mission to investigate ""Suspicious Claims"", aka, Darwin Award candidates.  Through the whole thing, their trials and tribulations are documented by a masters student recording them for a documentary.
  Very funny re-enactments, great ones that they chose, and a load of cameos by Metallica, The Myth Busters, amongst others,  Definately worth renting, or buying.",1186272000,,623,5.19
2838828,4,B000QGDJF6,"I did have the hopes that this movie would be a reinactment of the best Darwin Awards, but it wasn't.  Still, it was decent.  It's characters have been used before, but the storyline was new.  The main character is a ""play it safe"" guy who has a huge facination with the Darwin Awards.  He doesn't want to turn into one. In trying to avoid any troubles in his life, he has isolated himself from everybody.  Then he looses his job as a police profiler, and change is needed.  He decides to sell his skill and knowledge of the Darwin awards to an Insurance company, who he thinks he can save millions of dollars a year by profiling people that are high risk for the next Darwin Award.  Well, little does he know he's about to get a partner on his journey that will end up teaching him as much about life as he can give her.  Bottom line, It's entertaining, but no award winner.  And David Arquette is only in it briefly...so i have no idea why he's highlighted on this movie...oh yeah, he's the biggest name.  Anyway, check it out, worth a laugh or two.",1186185600,,1051,4.316326530612245
2838829,4,B000QGDJF6,"""The Darwin Awards"" is not a defense of evolutionary biology, but a tongue-in-cheek honor given to those whose foolish bravado and dumb choices do a service to the gene pool--by removing themselves from it.  The yuppie who attempts to demonstrate the supposedely bulletproof windows in his high-rise apartment by running right into them.  The guy who goes ice fishing using dynamite.  The freeloader whose attempt to steal from a vending machine results in his being crushed by it.  These and other such stories have done wonders for our collective sense of schadenfreude and have spawned numerous websites (the most popular bearing the name ""darwinawards""), books and now this movie.  While it's far less silly than some of the characters who populate it, ""The Darwin Awards"" is a generally funny, though not entirely successful, attempt to bring this brand of dark humor to the masses.

Joseph Fiennes plays a forensic detective whose risk-averse nature and hemataphobia (he faints at the sight of blood) has caused his departure from the force.  However, his skills convince an insurance company to go cross-country investigating strange cases, which could save them untold millions if the claims turn out to be the result of foolish choices and downright stupidity.  He is teamed with a free-spirited insurance investator played by Winona Ryder (her first major role in a number of years) and, needless to say, zaniness ensues.  The cases they encounter on their travels are drawn from real life, or at least real urban legends, which are shown in flashback using an inspired cast of recognizable actors including David Arquette, Juliana Marguiles and the late Chris Penn (his last movie role) as well as cameos by the hosts of the TV show ""Mythbusters"" and heavy metal stalwarts Metallica.

These vignettes are often hilarious, even if you're already familiar with them from the web site or books, and the performances from the leads are just quirky enough to be interesting, even if the attempted romantic pairing never really works.  It's particularly nice to see Ryder back in action again, and in fine form as well (her involvement also allows her to name check Wilco, one of her favorite bands, and give a cameo to beat legend and family friend Lawrence Ferlinghetti).  Writer/director Finn Taylor keeps things moving at a good clip and does a good job balancing the ""main"" story of the investigators with the backstories of the characters they encounter.  What doesn't work is the sub-plot of a documentary film maker who tags along, suppodedely doing a profile of Fiennes' character.  It's only point seems to be to implicate the viewer for taking enjoyment in the mishaps and death of others, and it comes off as distracting and even a bit insulting.  It's also unnecessary, since Taylor manages to simultaneously mock and celebrate the Darwin cases.  he sees them as beautiful losers and misguided dreamers, so we see how anyone, even us, can meet an embarrassing end.  Also, by movie's end it plays almost as the pilot for some strange television show--maybe a cross between ""The X-Files,"" ""Moonlighting"" and ""Jackass.""  Therefore, as a movie, it seems incomplete.

The disc extras are, you would expect, rather sparse.  The usual info-mercial for the film is joined by short interview clips of the cast.  I would have preferred to see more of Ryder (okay, I admit it, I'm a fan--BTW, Winona, if you're reading this, please marry me!) and given the circumstances, Chris Penn's segment is far too brief.  Still, if you long for movies in the spirit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heathers/dp/B00000IBRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heathers</a>, and you don't set your expectations too high, ""The Darwin Awards"" is worth the prize of your attention.",1186012800,4,3808,5.2081967213114755
2838830,3,B000QGDJF6,"Althought the premise is good, the cast fabulous (chuck full of cameo performances), and the production values above average, this film doesn't know whether it wants to be a Rom-Com, straight comedy, or mystery.  So it's all three.  The staging of the various ""Darwin Awards"" is usually VERY funny, and Fiennes does a great job as the lead (he's genuinely funny doing both slapstick and some more 'high-brow' stuff);but Ryder's 'tough-girl' is just too cliched, and you never really get to feel that she is capable of becoming involved with Fiennes.  If you are looking for a little mindless fun(and I do mean mindless, as in people doing some really absurd stunts)then you will like this film.",1179273600,14,694,4.914529914529915

2838845,4,B000QGDJF6,"Goofy. Tragic.  But why am I laughing?  Joseph Fiennes is a Sherlock/ genius in his own world that can't fit into ours.  He can't handle the sight of blood, afraid of women, guilty over a botched police collar of a serial killer, and fastidious about safety.  Winona Ryder is his foible picking Watson.  Two depressed misfits on a journey trying to solve stupid and often fatal insurance claims.

  If you like dark, quirky comedies, e.g., The Big Lebowski, or if you like road trip movies, you'll like this.  The leads work wonderfully together.  Both Ryder and Fiennes need more comedy and less drama in their lives, and they're good at it. The 'cases' are hilarious, but I really enjoyed the 'Odd Couple' leads duking it out as their personalities grate on each other in a tortured, sex-tensed, romantic sort of way.

  The other story involving the search for a serial killer is put in there  to promote the big climax, and the Peeping-Tom, worthless, documentary student is silly but provides humorous asides.
  It's a night of escapism at other people's, who are not at our level of evolutionary development, expense.",1204070400,5,1123,4.831578947368421

It was a lot funnier than I expected, with plenty of slapstick comedy, but most of it was anchored with more intelligent humor behind it. Which is a little ironic when you consider what The Darwin Awards are actually about. There's a cursory love story as well, which manages to feel kind of natural, not outrageously forced.

The jokes are brash and sometimes very black but funny.
If you like features that are unfamiliar but have something to them. Darwin Awards is for you. Also if you ever had a dream to go fast, this is a must see.",1198195200,,463,4.202247191011236
2838848,3,B000QGDJF6,"As you know, the film's title ""The Darwin Awards"" refers to the ""awards"" that really exist, for the people who died in the most bizarre (and you may say, stupid) way. I believe some, or many of the reported cases on this website should actually belong to urban legend genre, but anyway, though some may find them offensive, to me these episodes are not only silly but also amusing often in a very dark way.

The problem of the film inspired by the actual Darwin Awards is this: How can we tell a story that is as amusing as these source materials? The film, ""The Darwin Awards,"" tries hard to solve it by using two familiar narrative strategies: one is the road movie format where the film's hero and disgraced SFPD profiler Michael Burrows (Joseph Fiennes) travels across the country with a surly insurance investigator Siri (Winona Ryder). The other is the pseudo-documentary narrative, an interviewer who mostly stays behind the camera, following the two leads and occasionally interrupting them. Plus, the film has to tell us a sub-plot about a killer

However, despite the capable leads and funny cameos including late Chris Penn, the weak romance and underdeveloped characters (especially Ryder's) need more improvement. Fake documentary idea is simply unnecessary and even annoying. The latter idea does not make much sense after all as what most people want to see is ""The Darwin Awards"" and why some people are often driven to behave in a very ridiculous way.

While watching this, I thought there must be a terrific film buried deep under the confusing script. At least the film's ""award"" part and how these people ""win"" are amusing even though you have heard about them, but the film is a little disappointing, considering the cast and the source material.",1198022400,,1767,4.883333333333334

The premise of weeding out the gene pool by finding the people who commit the dumbest ""suicides"" (as it were) seemed really fresh and appealing. The execution, though, of this film is repetitive and ultimately monotonous as Fiennes and Ryder simply go from crime scene to crime scene with little interesting connective material. It is an interesting idea for a film, but it simply goes no where and is ultimately dull and lifeless.

Given the subject matter, this could have been a lot funnier even before La Ryder showed up. Maybe a documentary on the Darwin winners would do the job. This sure doesn't.",1194998400,5,487,4.48314606741573

Michael (Joseph Fiennes) saves the insurance company lots of $$$ traveling cross country investigating strangely stupid deaths. His partner, played by Wynona Ryder is a veteran adjustor & doesn't really get him or his theories. It's very funny is spots.  You know what's going to happen but it's funny anyway. When they try to get back to the plot for too long, it gets tedious. This could very well be a sit-com. You know: one stupid fatality every week.

A unique investigator who faints at the sight of blood actually sees himself in the shoes of the killer/or accident victim, and so do we, adding to the humorous look at serious human failings.  I love the 'excuse' for people trying dumb things, and happen to agree with it. Little 'insults' do take their toll on ordinary people.  They saved the best for the end with the two young rock and roll fans involved in a freakish accident.  Very different from mainstream comedy and highly entertaining.

Michael happens to be obsessed with following events that deserve ""The Darwin Award"", the kind of stupid things that people do that get themselves killed. Michael has devised a profile for the type of person that is most likely to commit these type of stupid acts, which would merit these ""Darwin Awards"".

2838855,4,B000QGDJF6,"The Darwin Awards is about an eccentric investigator obsessed with the Darwin Award deaths - awards for those who die in such stupid ways their death raises humanity's IQ.

This movie is not a traditional comedy and will not appeal to everybody.  However, if you enjoy dark humor, sharp wit and reading between the lines, you will find a LOT to enjoy in this movie.  The script is expertly written, and the cast will make you wonder why you never heard of this movie.

Joe Feinnes plays the detective, and he switches to being an insurance claims investigator when he loses his job at the San Francisco Police Department.  He is paired with Winona Ryder, a cynical claims agent slow to accept his psychological theories.  In time they grow closer, and eventually she helps him catch the one crook who escaped him as a cop.

The story is filmed from the perspective of a documentary film maker played by Wilmer Valderama.  There are also cameo appearances by John Doe (from the L.A. punk band X), beat poet Lawrence Ferlingetti, writer Josh Kornbluth, and Metallica.  Add to that an all-star cast that includes:
David Arquette, Juliette Lewis, Julianna Margulies, Robin Tunney, Nora Dunn, Tom Hollander, Alessandro Nivola and the late Chris Penn in his final role.  The list goes on.

The dialogue is subtle so I can understand why some might not find this to be their cup of tea.  Some of the death stories could have been executed better.  The romantic climax of the film also seems forced.  Still, the good far outweighs the bad here.  If you give this movie a second chance you might be surprised.

Overall, this is a fun movie that will make you laugh.  If you are a fan of ""Six Feet Under,"" you will find yourself wondering why there wasn't a mass market for this film.  Enjoy!",1193356800,18,1782,4.638977635782748

During screenings, the audiences roared with laughter, especially when they could ""see it coming,"" like the lawyer bragging about his panoramic corner office, and its supposedly unbreakable windows.  Perhaps the laughter was influenced by the bleak nature of most other Sundance films--a comedy was a rare treat!

I wasn't necessarily expecting to enjoy the film, because the Darwin Awards website was peripheral.  To Wendy's chagrin, not a single suggestion she made was incorporated.  But... I loved it!  It was quirky, and jammed with silly bits!  The Metallica concert scenes were tremendous; the last line in the movie is a quip by Metallica's James Hatfield.  The MythBusters' appearance as junkstore owners of a JATO is fall out of your seat funny.

And the mylar balloon...

Minor points that I disliked: Some of the winners are portrayed as rednecks, but DarwinAwards.com avoids sterotyping.  Not all of the scenes show self-inflicted injury, such as the dentist and patient.  And a laugh is taken at the expense of a duck hunter trying to rescue his buddy.  IMO it is heroic to risk personal danger in order to save another.

However, I still laughed all the way through the movie, and I think you will too.

The film's rocky path through the distribution channel was due to politics, not the quality of the movie.  Happily, several independent theaters have screened The Darwin Awards to full audiences.

2838860,3,B000QGDJF6,"I'd read that THE DARWIN AWARDS test-screened so poorly at a film festival that people were walking out.  In any event, this film obtained no theatrical distribution and sat on a shelf for over a year before being ""dumped"" on DVD.

However, it's not such a bad film.  The problem may lie in that comedy is the most subjective of genres.  If you love horror, chances are you'll enjoy most every horror film.  Not so with comedy.  Ten people may each love comedy, yet have very different ideas as to ""what's funny.""

I didn't think THE DARWIN AWARDS was too funny, but it was amusing and entertaining, although it became repetitive toward the end.  One reviewer noted that it felt like a TV show, and that's true.  It's like watching several episodes all at once.  The film did try and tie-in some larger ""film themes"" into the story.  It ends trying to impose respect upon Darwin fatalities, showing that these people died because they had imagination and daring.

THE DARWIN AWARDS felt similar to another Winona Ryder film, MR. DEEDS (which I also found to be mildly amusing, not hilarious).  She essentially played the same character: a hard, cynical woman who sleeps around a lot, until she meet a more ""innocent"" man who draws out the soft-hearted romantic within her.  (Both films even had a similar frozen lake scene, which increased that deja vu feeling.)

Joseph Fiennes did a good job as the comedic innocent who's afraid to live, although he's too tall and strong-looking to make for an entirely believable wimp.

Lots of nice cameos in this film.  It's a pleasant film, but not hilarious, nor a classic.  I even doubt it will become a cult classic.  It's amusing, but not as dark or edgy as it might have been.",1187740800,5,1721,4.657807308970099
