6075479,5,B00GHH9IDA,"The bullet collectors are forensic teams whose data goes nowhere since 97% of Juarez' 3,000+ annual murders will never be solved.  Before we shame narco groupies and singers and hangers'-on, we must first examine our own glorification of, defense of and entertainment by powerful crime figures like John Gotti, John Dillinger, Jesse James, gangsta rappers; the list goes on and on and on.

Though women are murdered in cartel wars, one aspect not addressed are the fact that it's mostly men murdering men.  When thousands of men are murdered in a single city every year, surely the impact on surviving women, children, society and the economy is devastating.  It's rather like a male genocide that will take generations to recover and restore gender and family balance.

As far as narco-corridos music itself, what we're shown has no bass, no funk and all is umbilically attached to a 3/3-timed oom-pa-pa, oom-pa-pa beat.  Accordions can be made get down and get funky, but until that happens in this genre, it simply cannot go mainstream in America.  The lyrics about murder, guns and dope are not much different than American rap top-40 hits.  The singers imitate the gestures they see in American rap vidoes, but appear absurdly out of place with a polka beat.

Narco Cultura shows us narco cops, narco groupies, narco entertainers, narco workers and of course narco victims.  One particular mother, instead of sobbing in a crumpled heap, screams with rage to the world the question of why Mexico is resigned to helplessness and fear and doing nothing.  One of the most powerful scenes is Juarez' City of the Dead; a cemetery bizarrely lavish with multi-story mansions for the dead as far as the eye can see.

Powerful film.",1393372800,9,1727,4.937716262975779
6075480,5,B00GHH9IDA,"To a growing number of Mexicans and Latinos in the Americas, narco-traffickers have become iconic outlaws, glorified by musicians who praise their new models of fame and success. They represent a pathway out of the ghetto, nurturing a new American dream fueled by an addiction to money, drugs, and violence. From war photographer Shaul Schwarz comes NARCO CULTURA, an explosive look at the drug cartels' pop culture influence on both sides of the border as experienced by an LA narcocorrido singer dreaming of stardom and a Juarez crime scene investigator on the front line of Mexico's Drug War",1393286400,4,594,5.071428571428571

6075497,4,B00GHH9IDA,"This documentary is one of the most disturbing I've ever seen.  It is truly sad that so many people have to live in such violence, and fall victim to it.  The Narco music culture is not only disturbing but strange; you have a bunch of men dressed in Mexican cowboy garb, with AK-47's on the back.  The fact that the perpetrators of the violence look so much like everyday people is the reason why it's perplexing to see a bunch of men wearing cowboy costumes talking about chopping up bodies.  Glorifying deviant subcultures is nothing new, but the level of gruesome violence and the happy tone of the music is an example of extreme sociopathy at it's worst.",1413244800,4,658,4.5508474576271185

6075500,5,B00GHH9IDA,"If you ever wanted to have an inside look as to why people leave their countries. Narco Cultura is a good start in the multitude of reasons why people flee to America. Notice I said, ""flee"" not ""flock"" for there is a difference.

Narco Cultura is a documentary that shows you the brutal life the people of Jurez suffer through on a daily basis. It gives you just a small, brutal taste as to why you see so many illegal immigrants in America. It shows you that most of the hispanic people from Central America actually have no interest to move to America.

As one of the main characters in this movie tells you. ""When I'm in Mexico, I feel more comfortable, more at peace, more like myself. I can speak my language, go wherever I please, and not worry that I'm breaking some laws."" This isn't an exact quote, but the gist is obviously that he never wants to leave his home country.

However, the gang violence and the atrocities committed by the drug cartels are extinguishing him and his colleagues one by one. To make matters worse, the Mexican people have started to idolize these drug dealers who carry assault rifles and ""stick it to the man.""

There is a lot of death in this movie, a lot of real life death with gruesome depictions of dead bodies, burnt corpses, and a mother screaming over the death of her decapitated son.

Yes. Decapitated.

You'll also get to see in this film, the other side of the fence. You'll see a Mexican-American trying to make it big as a Narco Cultura singer. Let me just tell you that right off the bat, you're not going to like this guy. He idolizes the violence and is just a punk kid who doesn't know any better. He's a part of the group that's creating this ""Narco Cultura"" where they want Mexicans to love the music about drug dealers killing the cops and shooting people with AK-47's.

What he stands for is despicable and this movie is certainly sad to watch, yet morbidly fascinating. The pacing is good, the cinematography is excellent, the content is gripping, and you may feel your world unexpectedly expanded after watching this.

I highly recommend this movie if you can stomach the violence and depression it may inflict upon you.",1406419200,7,2181,4.531806615776081

Compelling narrative follows two separate individuals and through them we get a glimpse of stark reality how drug and its business is affecting the lives.. one who glamourize and another whose sense of duty guides him to do the right but has to perform duties in fear..
I'd say it's totally worth it to google the directoor 'Shaul Schwarz' and check out his photography and short film works on his website. Amazing works.",1405296000,,581,4.650485436893204

It was shallow.and paint by numbers.  I could not wait for it to be over.  Who was the pretty dead girl in the opening scene?  I honestly didn't care about a single person.  I felt for the bullet collectors, I guess.  What about all the crusaders that have been killed?  What about border crossing and killings in America?",1403308800,,477,4.5058823529411764

6075532,5,B00GHH9IDA,"Disregard the cover art, this is in no way the gangster drama that the image might suggest. This movie adeptly weaves together the story of an esoteric ""art form"" (I use this term loosely, as I find the genre of ""narcocorridos"" to be repulsive for the most part) that most Americans likely know nothing about with the story of a horrific years-long crime against humanity committed by the drug cartels (with assistance from the Mexican gov't, whether wittingly or not) against the defenseless citizens of Mexico, namely the border town of Juarez. At first it seems that the storyline is one that pits the heroic public servants of the criminal forensics division of the city of Juarez versus that of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who choose to glorify cartel violence for their own entertainment and profit. The reality turns out to be far more complex. The humanity and suffering of the families in Juarez is what really comes through in the film- this is a story that should be much more widely known than it is in the U.S..

6075534,5,B00GHH9IDA,"This is a must see documentary.
One world that people that we hear about in the news but we do not really pay attention to it,
through the eyes of a Mexican CSI that gets more victims to process in Juarez than in the all seasons of
the CSI series.  A brutal documentary that goes as deep as it is allowed.
The secondary story in the documentary is from the side of an upcoming signer (he doesn't actually signs
all that great) that writes and sings about the narco wars but from the side of the ""bad"" guys that he respects.
It is amazing to watch people singing, dancing and having fun when the guys sings about killings and assassins,
not only in Mexico but in the USA too.",1396051200,3,674,4.224806201550388

8623089,1,B00GHH9IDA,"Narco Cultura is a sensationalist depiction of the War on Drugs. It misrepresents the narcocorrido bands by focusing on the Movimiento Alterado, which is the equivalent of the Gangsta Rap. Schwarz only shows fascinated people with drug culture. He does not contextualize the drug war within the political intervention of State violence and corruption. The director could have presented the many people who are grieving the dead and who are protesting against their government contribution to the violence. Again, this documentary does not present the two sides of the issues in the War on Drugs. The documentary is propagandistic, so it wouldn't surprise me that government money has been the engine to bring a professional photographer of war (usually working in the Middle East) to go to Mexico and document the narcocorrido. The Bukanas of Culiac&aacute;n have no direct knowledge of the war and it shows how disconnected all this is. Yet Schwarz wants to convince us that Narco Cultura is rampant and clearly winning the hearts of the people. This is just not accurate and a clear misrepresentation.",1446768000,2,1103,5.167597765363128
