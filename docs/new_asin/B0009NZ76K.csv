2305645,1,B0009NZ76K,this is nothing but a old fart telling the story of the first movie. DVD makes a good coaster.,1167350400,4,94,4.0
2305646,4,B0009NZ76K,"This movie is alot of fun. It's Bigfoot down south again scaring cute girls with their 1980's apparel on and basically just being a cool monster.  In many ways this is superior to ""Legend of Boggy Creek"". It's better directed and has characters that are interesting.  Also, the scene a night with the sonar blips is actually kind of scary. It's not as bad as alot of viewers say.

Check it out.",1137369600,11,394,4.444444444444445
2305647,3,B0009NZ76K,"If you're a bigfoot movie fan, this is a must-see; but you may want to check out the version on the DVD set 'Mystery Science Theater 3000 Collection - Volume 5', who summarizes the movie as ""When you major in boggy creek studies, you can pretty much write your own ticket"".",1128211200,15,273,4.372549019607843
2305648,2,B0009NZ76K,"You can't blame Charles Pierce for wanting to go back to that Boggy Creek well again after the first movie, but this time he pulls up a bucket full of fetid water.  This movie is all sorts of wrong!  From casting himself in the role of ""Doc"" to putting his own son in a large supporting role, sans shirt for a majority of the running time, Pierce misfires on almost every level.  The flashback stories almost brought back the flavor of the original Boggy Creek (the outhouse scene alone is a hoot), but then he offsets that with the hilarious ""mad dog!"" scene.  By the time Old Man Crenshaw shows up, the wheels totally fly off this shaky cart and promptly bursts into flames!  Being a bigfoot sub-genre fanatic, I feel justified buying this title, but do not see spinning the DVD as often as the far superior The Legend of Boggy Creek.  Where's Travis Crabtree when you really need him?!",1127433600,19,888,4.484472049689441

2305689,5,B0009NZ76K,"I liked it, I though it was suspenseful and exciting, but I'm a big bigfoot and monster/ myth believer. I like the story line and for me it was a great movie",1416700800,,157,3.9375
2305690,5,B0009NZ76K,"Possibly the most ridiculous film ever made.  I highly recommend it.  The MST3K treatment is great, but Boggy 2 really stands on its own.  Great for amateur riffers to improve their skills on.  I want to be Old Man Crenshaw when I grow up.",1412380800,,239,4.363636363636363

2305692,2,B0009NZ76K,I remember the original 'Boggy Creak. It was kind of a cult flick. I guess I was expecting more chills & thrills like that original. I tought the story was week,1403740800,,160,4.193548387096774
2305693,3,B0009NZ76K,I very much enjoyed this movie. However you must understand what you are getting into when you watch it. It is very cheesy with the good kind of bad acting!!,1379980800,,157,4.266666666666667
2305694,1,B0009NZ76K,"""Boggy Creek 2: And the legend continues"" is a purported sequel to the cult classic ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"". It seems that Charles B Pierce was bogged down in his own legend, spewing forth new Bigfoot-related B-movies on a semi-regular basis. He even stars in this one! ""Boggy Creek 2"" is pure fiction, and comes across as a hybrid between Bigfoot pseudo-documentary, horror movie and sweet morality tale. Nothing wrong with that, per say, but despite a few plot twists, it never gets off the ground. A classical turkey rather than a new cult classic. One star, period.",1379721600,2,573,4.797979797979798

2305697,3,B0009NZ76K,To truly enjoy this movie you MUST and i repeat MUST see the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) version of this movie....it eliminates the whole mad dog part altogether.....but its HILARIOUS to watch on MST3K,1339372800,3,210,5.0285714285714285
2305698,5,B0009NZ76K,This film was even better than Charles B. Peirces' original movie. The story is interesting and the acting is good. Great Movie!,1301097600,,128,4.863636363636363
2305699,1,B0009NZ76K,What more can I say?  MST just does it all.  I don't think I could have watched this movie without them!,1280707200,2,104,3.9047619047619047
2305700,4,B0009NZ76K,"Ten times out of ten you just can not go wrong by cuing up any episode of Mystery Science Theater. Since we've always watched terrible movies while thoroughly making fun, the MST3K series has exactly what we're looking for. The only gripe we have is the fact that this series isn't still being made. For us the B market has only picked up steam over the years and needs and outlet like this or a weekly dose of Joe Bob's MonsterVision. For some reason or other the mainstream doesn't feel the need to recognize B the way it should, but we certainly do. That is why we continue on our lifetime mission of watching and reviewing B to contribute to it thriving in the years to come.

Boggy Creek 2 starts off with a Doctor on his quest to find the elusive ape creature wandering the swamp land. In his journey he brings 2 chicks (1 being really hot for the mid 80's) and some skinny kid that constantly gets torn apart by our MST crew. As they search they do make contact with the ape and discover he's on some type of war path, but not sure what for. Once they meet a fat shirtless hick across the lake they discover the reason for the recent ape-man attacks. See the giant redneck captured the ape-man's kid and has been keeping it hostage for a week or so. Once Doctor finds this out he offers the ape a truce, the stickiest of the icky, and gives him back his youngin to wander back off peacefully into the woods.

Outside of the non-stop laughs from all the comments this one was pretty hilarious in it's own right. It's shot in a documentary style at an attempt to make it appear real only adding to the charm of it's B-ness. The ape creature looks very similar to something you'd see a trick-or-treater wearing while perusing the streets for nutrageous bars on October 31st. The ape suits are just hilarious. The acting also right on track for a great low budget feature packed with a great practiced Southern accent courtesy of Dr. Van Nostran. We can absolutely recommend this for the B lovers out there but would suggest the MST3K version for a heavy dose of laughs.",1267660800,,2073,4.395833333333333
2305701,5,B0009NZ76K,I go this movie for a present for someone who had been looking for it everywhere and I found it on Amazon. I got the movie really fast and in perfect condition! Thank you so much! My friend thanks you too!,1236124800,2,205,4.024390243902439

2305704,3,B0009NZ76K,"Look, it's easy to be critical of this sequel to the cult classic "" The Legend of Boggy Creek"", both were the artistic love childs of film maker Charles Pierce and are done in a documentary style that begs to be believed as authentic story telling. It is at all times entertaining and for the most part, not a bad re-dux. To get in the proper mood watch the original first and then the second as a double feature and you may like it more. Sadly this film fails to satisfy the fear we all want to feel at night in the woods when we hear a unknown sound in the dark and run screaming "" Bigfoot!!!"".",1213833600,5,596,4.102564102564102

This 7-foot tall primate, noted for it's pungent aroma (sometimes called the ""Skunk Ape""), has been seen by more than 1,000 people, photographed by dozens, and directly contacted with at least five credible witnesses.

2305706,1,B0009NZ76K,I do not recommend this DVD to buy. if you want to see it RENT it. The original Legend of Boggy Creek is totally different from this movie. The original was pretty scary. A lot of the information is pretty accurate I feel.,1198368000,4,222,4.186046511627907
2305707,1,B0009NZ76K,This is one of those movies where you invite your friends over to make jokes about each scene. Just like with mystery science theatre. In fact I think this was one of the movies they roasted. If you can find it in a pawn shop for a buck then get it otherwise its not even worth renting.,1191369600,2,286,4.035087719298246

8063912,2,B0009NZ76K,"BOGGY CREEK 2: AND THE LEGEND CONTINUES, begins w/ the notorious ""deer slaughter"" scene. It seems that the Boggy Creek Monster is up to its old tricks again! This causes Dr. Lockhart (Director, Charles B. Pierce- THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK, THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN, THE EVICTORS) and his team of college student helpers (Two beautiful coeds, and a guy who only wears shirts when absolutely necessary), to head for the swamps of Texarcana to investigate, and hopefully locate the creature. They experience several adventures along the way, including a mad dog encounter, the horrors of 1985 PC technology, and some actual run-ins w/ the big, hairy lug. BC2 is a less entertaining film than the original, although it does have just as many hillbillies in it. Pierce's stilted voice-over narration adds little to the overall quality of the production. Neither do the stories told in flashback form. The bottom line is that this movie is pretty dull. Lonnnng stretches of nothing take up most of the running time.
