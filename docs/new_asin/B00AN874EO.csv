5458739,1,B00AN874EO,this is suppose to be a pandemic movie which turns into some sort of free your brain movie. no action at all. can we stop with the weird guy with a camera bit already.,1386547200,,167,3.9411764705882355
5458740,1,B00AN874EO,"This movie was about as entertaining as watching a goldfish swim in a bowl for 90 minutes. Everything was wrong about this movie, the script was flat, the premise was never really developed, the characters were wooden, the camera work was cheesey, the plot kept going down rabbit trails that led to nothing, and despite all that I stayed with it hoping it would end with a flourish. Nope, the ending was just as dissapointing as the rest of the movie. None of the characters are particularly human or likeable, and in the end you won't really care what happens.",1385856000,64,561,4.62

5458750,1,B00AN874EO,"I sincerely apologize to the 1 star reviewers because I was stupid enough to watch this pretentious piece of garbage to the end...or actually stupid enough to even click start.  I don't know who the actors, director, screenwriter(surely there can't have been more than 1) or producers were, and I am sure I will never know just as I am sure none of these will make it to the Oscars, ever, because they will forever be tarred by having participated in this disaster. It is a shame the virus didn't get all of them immediately and thus saved us all from even being tempted to watch.  Only one plot, a bunch of undeveloped storylines, zero continuity anywhere, dialog (and acting) that is the sorriest I have witnessed, probably ever.

5458753,2,B00AN874EO,"I have to say that I agree with pretty much every review previously done for this movie......it struck me as having substance, or at least just about to reveal it at any moment. And I confess that I am still waiting, long after it finally (thankfully) ended. So I am assuming that what I saw was pretty much it. Apparently this film was done pure as a tribute to the person it was dedicated to at the end, and that person had interesting concepts about the afterlife and the Universe. But any such like content was poorly transferred into the movie in a coherent manner. On the positive side, I do highly recommend this film for aspiring film maker as a cautionary tale in what not to do while film making.",1408838400,,706,4.396946564885496

Not that it isn't always fun to combine depthless stupidity with spectacular pretentiousness, but there isn't a character in this film who doesn't speak as though trying to manipulate this funny new thing... a tongue... and learn the hopeless complexities of English syntax in sentences consisting of five words... because, really, every scientist I know pronounces ""escape"" as ""ekscape"" and pauses for six seconds between consecutive words, getting the inflection of the next one as wrong as humanly possible.

The actors are hopelessly, hopelessly bad.  The script appears to have been cobbled together by a dysfunctional gibbon.  The narrative... um, there isn't one.  There isn't anything.  Just forget it and go watch grass grow.",1406592000,,813,5.354330708661418

So, I stopped by anyways since it didn't cost me anything I'm a Amazon prime member it was free. I was hoping the first episode was slow because it gave the audience some background into what happen, so I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting, nothing . Who ever filmed this was a terrible camera person, I hate those ""Blair witch project films"" no one ever has a steady hand when filming the movie.

The whole thing was a waste of energy, money, effort and anything else that went into the making or viewing of this film.  They named it New Order but it should have been named New Age because much of the ideas in the film were just that........ or maybe New Age Boredom because that's exactly how I felt while watching it.  I kept expecting it to somehow get better, thinking it couldn't get much worse.  I was wrong.  I wish there was a zero star rating but I had to give it at least one star.

I have an inkling, but the actuality is that it's not worth the thought of it. This was truly a waste of film. There was no development, no plot, no answers to anything. Like a lot of other bad movies, you have to wonder, what in the world made them think this had any value to anyone else, at all.

5458781,5,B00AN874EO,"... if you think that movies like Cloud Atlas are not up to your higher intellect. I mention this other movie just as a more recent reference since I don't really like comparisons and as a matter of personal taste I try to watch unbiased in order to enjoy and understand every material on it's own merit without rising expectations about what it's going to happen a priori.

  This type of movies are not for everyone especially if you expect to be amazed in a linear progression and get a  fulfilling sense of accomplishment and growth at the end, this is not your average trill ride.

  Honestly until about half of the movie I thought : "" low budget movie with an average end of the world story, half decent acting, sound could been better (especially the end credits song), etc..""

  But then about 3/4 of the journey, I got hooked up, it's very interesting what they did with the twist, that I won't spoil for those interested in this genre, like I mentioned along the lines of Cloud Atlas less epic, less grandiose but similar message and within the constraints of low budget.

  This movie is no fun,  action packed or stunning, it's just possibilities and it does require you to think by yourself, if this does not appeal to you just skip it you'll be doing yourself a favor. For those in the minority you won't regret it if you're intrigued by what really lies below, open to possibilities , are we really here? or are we just a forgotten thought in eternity?

  I can understand as to why most reviews are bad, thankfully I didn't read them before watching. The title at first make it look like if the film had something to do with the world of conspiracy theorist, the description tries to reel you in but obviously is not going to reveal the ending (no plot because there is none, just assumptions) and what comes in the middle is what most viewers judge as character development, in true that never happens because it's not your average summer movie.

  But if you stick long enough paying attention to the subtleties you'll get a surprise at the end (which it's not exactly one if you follow the context of the movie) instead it's one of those that let you philosophically wonder ""what if...?""",1400630400,3,2207,4.525252525252525

The characters are very very confused about what is going on and there is no narrator to give us the story line.  We are as puzzled about what is happening as the characters are.  When all is revealed at the end, it makes sense, at least to me.

5458796,2,B00AN874EO,"What I like about this movie:

- I don't watch much movies but this movie was shot in new way to me. There are few parts that I loved how they shot the scenes in. Because of the fact that shown at the end I can understand why it got shot or filmed that way.

What I didn't like about this movie:

- I got it at the end what it is..and when I did I found that it might not be in the right genre after all (science fiction).
-There is one character that I didn't get its reactions at all but the rest in overall were fine if we are talking about acting but reactions were little bit not satisfying for the viewer.
- This movie is little bit moves in slow pace.
- Some scenes are not necessary if  what is presented at the end of the movie is true.
- Explanations at the end is not satisfying as well as presenting the explanation.

I find in overall that this movie is enjoyable for the way it got shot or filmed and not necessary for the story or other factors.

5458809,1,B00AN874EO,"I've been watching a lot of movies lately with no plot, bad acting, low budgets, and a script written for lobotomized chimpanzees.  This movie is no exception.  I don't review all the bad movies I watch.  I feel I've suffered enough by viewing them.  Let alone, re-living the experience in a review.  I kept thinking the film maker had a choice between taking the change in his pocket and buying a pack of gum or making a movie.  I could've gone for a stick of gum.  Few locations added to the monotony of the dialog.  And be prepared.  Bad dialog is all you'll get from this film.  My moment of disappointment peaked when two of the characters were going into town to get supplies.  You see them fight over taking a gun.  Then the action cuts back to them in the compound and leaves you wondering, ""When did they go to town?  I might've wanted to see that.""  The only excitement I experienced was waiting for one of those cheap looking micro-chips to fall off their heads.  That at least would have been something.",1393459200,21,1015,4.440217391304348

But this had a great story idea that they made the most of, with great pacing that picks up incrementally with each scene. The ending is also a nice payoff, it wraps up the unusual narrative pieces well and offsets the handful of truly scary scenes.
If you're going to slag off a small-budget, earnest film like this, then stick to the mainstream stuff. This isn't an elaborate post-apocalyptic movie. If you want that, go watch Book of Eli or The Road again.",1393372800,3,602,4.742857142857143

5458819,2,B00AN874EO,"Started it, the idea was trite and yet these things can sometimes be done well. End of the world, disease, apocalypse type stories but this one was just boring. Nothing grabbed the viewer to begin with and one was left indifferent to the characters and their plight at first meeting. Also, what was with all the plastic sheeting in the home? They left the windows and doors open but hung plastic sheeting on walls? I hope New Order disassociates themselves with this movie quickly and also returns to their original name, Joy Division.

5458824,1,B00AN874EO,I was expecting more drama and intrigue. The movie seemed confusing just for the sake of being confusing. A very boring film.,1389830400,2,125,4.7272727272727275

5458828,2,B00AN874EO,"With another attempt to show people destroying their own future, film makers have taken it to another place.  The attempt to study life and people are put above living life.  With a beautiful home and countryside, the interior of the home is put under ""sterile"" conditions until the sterility of life isolates those with each other the same as sterile conditions isolate study specimens.  Instead of finding new life, they hunt for what is wrong and make more wrong in their lives. More killing and death result. This could have become so much more.",1388102400,,549,4.819148936170213

5458831,1,B00AN874EO,"Maybe I missed something.  Like plot.  Or character development.  Or plot.
This has the feel of a student film if the student was studying shop and not film.
I tried to care.  Really.  But the witty repartee neither propelled the story forward or revealed any depth to any character.
I fast forwarded through a lot of it just to see if the set changed.  I just couldn't get past the plastic sheeting hanging everywhere which I supposed was meant to convey a sense of biohazard danger but apparently the characters think it a decorating accessroty because they clearly walk in and out with windows open like spring is just around the corner.  And someone gets to chop wood.  Ooooh arent't they survivalists.

Sometimes you just have to look at rentals like this as charity to film students everywhere.
If a plague had already killed 98% of the world's population what would motivate the surviving 2pct to spend any time looking for a cure?  Who would they be curing?  They're immune.  Obviously.  Unless you're a shop student who took a film elective and made this.  Some nonsense about implants that provide GPS location and medical sensing.  When your world is your backyard I'm not sure that matters.  Maybe something intangible and deep happened while I was fast forwarding but not one image made me want to stop the fast forward to see what was happening.  And suddenly it was over.

Thank god for fast forward, it saved me an evening.",1386892800,26,1439,4.710843373493976
