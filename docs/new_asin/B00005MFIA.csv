1625550,1,B00005MFIA,"I knew people would give this five stars simply because it's Bergman and Bergman can do no wrong.  I too love Bergman but this one goes beyond the pale and is sick, not to mention boring.  There are no redeeming qualities about this film and the characters are simply the most unappetizing characters I can remember seeing on film.  The only ""good"" person in the film was the poor child, Isabelle.  The acting was great; that's about it.

It's a case of where the emperor has no clothes.  Bergman lovers refuse to recognize this where Bergman is concerned.  If this were his first film, I would never have seen another Bergman film.",1223078400,,632,4.589285714285714
1625551,5,B00005MFIA,"Throughout his career, Bergman resisted ending his films with pat resolutions that tied up all loose ends.  They almost always end ambiguously, darkly but with a hint of fragile hope.

In ""Faithless,"" written by Bergman and directed by Liv Ullmann, this pattern continues.  Confessional as are all his movies, ""Faithless"" is a merciless self-examination on Bergman's part of his numerous past infidelities and the pain they caused to both himself and others.  In an astoundingly insightful move, Bergman structures the film as a memory.  The aged dramatist (Erland Josephson) invokes his ""muse,"" the memory of a past lover named Marianne (played by Lena Endre), and she retells the story of her adulterous involvement with the young dramatist (played by Krister Herriksson).  The scenes switch between Lena speaking directly to the old dramatist in his study and dramatizations of the story Lena is telling--perhaps the play the old dramatist himself is writing (that's just how wonderfully multi-layered the script is).

Both the script and the acting are so powerful that the film--really more theatrical than cinema, one of Bergman's famous ""chamber pieces""--at times is almost too painful to watch.  Endre's range of emotions is astounding--giddy love, crushing guilt, maternal despair.  Erland Josephson, the veteran Bergman ensemble actor, actually has very few lines.  But his facial expressions as he listens to his muse communicate perfectly the character's guilt, nostalgia, and need to find some kind of closure on his past.  Herriksson as the young dramatist is a pathetic neurotic who preys on women--as damning a self-portrait as Bergman ever wrote.

Ullmann's directing style is in the classic Bergman mode:  focus on faces, long silences, spartan sets.  And the film ends as it must:  the old dramatist, after remembering and reliving the details of the past infidelity, is shown walking by himself on a solitary beach.  Has he reached closure, or is he still haunted by the past?  There's really no indication one way or the other, probably because the question offers too simple an either-or.  Life is ambiguous.",1220227200,3,2130,5.288690476190476
1625552,5,B00005MFIA,"A masterwork !!!, Liv Ullman has reached the level of the Master Bergman (and maybe suppered him...)",1216425600,,100,4.9411764705882355
1625553,4,B00005MFIA,"This movie is a bit boring and a bit hard to follow, but the actual plot is what makes it worth it.  Sure, it's self-indulgent, almost to the point of being annoying, and the characters' real positions in the story are not obvious enough (Bergman most of all), but the movie is worth watching a few times, and enjoying for the honesty of the plot; the point is, what Bergman is portraying in this movie happens, happens often, and is not so difficult to relate to.  A woman who has an affair, loses her husband, then loses her ""affair-ee"", ends up with almost nothing in the end but the sadness and guilt of losing everything and being confused and trying to cover up by lying and making choices that she thought she was making for the best: these things happen every day, to many people, and the brutal truth of the story makes it worth it.  The acting is quite good, and for a movie in general, 'Faithless' is good, but for Bergman standards, it's definitely not up to potential.  If you have an interest in Bergman, get 'Cries and Whispers' or if you want something strange, check out some of his older stuff, even 'Fanny and Alexander' is not quite as boring and confusing as 'Faithless,' but again, this is definitely a movie worth seeing.",1073260800,5,1244,4.491150442477876
1625554,5,B00005MFIA,"""Faithless"" is a film that explores love, infidelity, guilt, pain, and humanity. The film was written by world-renowned director, Ingmar Bergman, and directed by Liv Ullman, an accomplished Swedish actress who is also Bergman's former wife.
The film begins with an old, retired film director named Bergman (Erland Josephson) who summons his muse in order to write a screenplay. At first invisible and reluctant to show herself, Bergman's muse eventually appears as Marianne (Lena Endre) his former wife. Marianne slowly discusses her previous marriage to a famous composer, Markus (Thomas Hanzon), and the subsequent events that resulted in her leaving him for his friend and artistic collaborator, David (Krister Hendriksson) who is also the younger Bergman. The conversation takes place over several days in Bergman's seaside house and assumes the form of flashbacks. The story is not a happy one, and exploring it is clearly a painful experience for Marianne, and for Bergman who for, perhaps the first time, is able to empathize with her and is able to view his own role from the perspective of detached wisdom and sorrow.
Faithless remains a penetrating and honest psychological exploration from start to finish and closely resembles Bergman's earlier films in style and temperament (although this one is directed by Liv Ullman). This film contains its share of difficulties, but if viewers, especially American viewers can get past them they will find it enormously rewarding. Some of the difficulties of this film are:
LENGTH
""Faithless is ""142"" minutes of largely dialog with subtitles. Even if you're into idea-oriented films, it takes a lot of commitment and stamina to pay close attention to this one.
STYLE
This film is almost like a cinematic play. The plot unfolds almost completely through dialog. While it has its share of symbols and devices, they are very restrained. There is no slick action, or special affects, and there are no obvious heroes or villains.
SUBTLETY
Bergman and Ullman are not trying to pound blunt ideas into our heads with obvious characters and a simple plot. Many of the ideas in this film are subtle and even paradoxical. It raises many disturbing questions and provides practically no obvious answers. One thing that might help is to think of this film as an exploration, or an important conversation that we get to overhear, but not as a product designed to gratify and amuse us (that's what ""Star Wars"" is for).
The powerful and rewarding thing about ""Faithless"" is that it relentlessly explores universal emotional and psychological truths that apply to all of us. Many of the terrible things we do in life have no concrete material or circumstantial justification but they do have a powerful emotional one that is almost impossible to explain. Marianne has no immediate justification for leaving Markus, who is a good husband and who pleases her in bed. Yet at the same time she feels no choice but to succumb to the emotional change that slowly and inexorably draws her to David. One day she simply sees him as a different person altogether, and her life takes on a drastic new momentum.
If you can accept the lengthy, conversational nature of this film and are not phased by the parts of it that may seem incomprehensible or alienating, you will recognize yourself in much of it. It is unlikely that the characters, all leading members of Swedish artistic circles, resemble any of us. But we will see bits of ourselves in their emotions, their actions, and in their struggle to explain the incompressible workings of the human soul. Stick it out and see it twice if you can. It's worth it.",1039910400,56,3637,4.99341021416804
7945458,3,B00005MFIA,"This was a rental, not a amazon purchase.
A somber film. Certainly well acted but no really sympathetic characters. Domestic relationships that are claustrophobic. A Bergman script directed by Ullman, but not really a film with film grammar,  more of a play. Like much of Bergman. It was interesting for me as I have seen lots of Bergman but nothing by Ullman as director. I won't be adding this to my film library anytime soon.

7945461,3,B00005MFIA,"Faithless was simply too long and had a very beautiful symetric point where it could have ended when the husband died. Also, it is flawed in that the old man who the story is told to never surprises us by having a role where he himself was involved in those events when he was younger. The narrative points where the actress comes back to the room to describe the next part of her story gets monotonous and very difficult to finish. Sleep talking and wide eyes are over used too often, subtracting from the most dramatic points in the film. Am curious if it will ever be dubbed into English.",1404691200,,591,4.381818181818182

7945464,5,B00005MFIA,"The authoring of this DVD is infuriating, and the entire purpose of this ""review"" is to warn you ahead of time so you don't end up losing your equanimity, as I did.

The DVD boots to the Main Menu, which consists of ""Play Movie"", ""Scene Selection"", ""Trailers"", and ""Filmographies"".

If you click to play the movie you get the usual studio credits, followed by, of all things, the trailers; the first of which is for the movie you are about to watch. I can imagine only a few things more irritating than sitting down to immerse oneself in a movie and having it be like those awful couple of seasons of Columbo (and a few other TV shows that used the same brilliant idea) where you are first subjected to highlights of the upcoming episode in order to totally ruin your enjoyment of it.

At first, not expecting anything like this at all, I was thinking ""Wow, this is a bit staccato. I'm having a really hard time keeping up, here!"" I quickly surmised that probably what we were experiencing was a series of flashbacks of the events leading up to the beginning of the film, by way of prelude, and that I'd have to start it over and pay more rapt attention if I was to have any chance of following any of it. But then I suddenly realised that the voice-over was in English. What? That can't be right! Then, of course, the breathless action segued into more breathless action extracted from some other movie entirely, and I realised what was happening.

After some fumbling with the remote control, in the dark, I managed to get back to the Main Menu. Assuming I'd somehow accidentally clicked on the wrong option, I tried again. But the same thing happened. I tried clicking ""next"" to skip the trailers, but doing this dropped me about thirty minutes into the actual movie.

I tried to click the ""fast rewind"" button but instead hit the ""Previous"" button, taking me back to the beginning of the credits, which lead inexorably into the trailer.

At this point I confess that I started pushing buttons on my remote pretty much at random, whilst cussing up a blue streak. For some reason my player buffers keystrokes, so even after I'd tossed the remote safely out of harm's way, the player opened and closed the DVD tray about five times before finally reloading the DVD and presenting me with the ""Resuming from saved position"" legend. I grabbed the remote back, but couldn't find the STOP button fast enough, and ended up doing more random button punching and cussing until my DVD player went into standby mode and the screen went blank.

Eventually, after calming down, turning on the lights, and muting the sound on my receiver, I got back to where I'd first started, at the Main Menu. This time I tried clicking on ""Scene Selections"" and chose the first one, entitled ""Opening Credits.""

Yup. You guessed it. Back to the trailers. But this time I was expecting it and was the model of calm propriety.

So. The trailers are authored to be the first part of the movie. You can't avoid them, and you can't jump directly to the beginning of the movie. The only thing you can do is fast forward through the trailers, with your eyes averted, to the seven minute mark when the movie actually starts.

Is ""Faithless"" good enough that all this irritation fades into insignificance once the movie starts?

I have no idea. Liv Ullmann; Ingmar Bergman. One can't imagine it could be anything but a sheer delight (despite a couple of the other reviews here). Unfortunately, by the time I had all this garbage figured out, my mood was completely shattered. All I wanted to do was step back and let things lie for a few weeks until I had forgotten having watched any of the scenes in that horrible, horrible trailer.

So instead of enjoying the movie as I'd planned, I decided to spend the time writing this ""Note to Self"", that I can fold up and stick in the DVD case, before putting the DVD further down in my stack of unwatched movies so that later, when it surfaces again, I can avoid the heartbreak I just experienced and instead just enjoy the show.

With my awesome memory, no doubt I'll read this six months from now and be thinking ""Ha! Thank goodness for Amazon reviews. Good thing I printed it out, or I bet I'd have been just like that poor guy!""

This cautionary tale, then, is here so that perhaps you can have the opportunity to do the same, and avoid being just like this poor guy.

[Why did I give a movie I've not yet seen 5 stars? I'm still looking forward to it. That's worth a tentative 5 stars right there.]",1352937600,5,4514,4.514705882352941
7945465,5,B00005MFIA,"If you are not a film buff who is familiar with Bergman, you will probably not make it through the first twenty minutes of this film.

7945466,5,B00005MFIA,"""Faithless"" brings back a type of film regrettably not made much any more:
An intimate, character-driven study of love, sex and regret.
What makes this sublime is the Bergman script, Ullman's direction and the probing acting, especially by Lena Endre.

Over 2-1/2 hours we get sucked into a story that is both deeply personal and completely universal: marriage, cheating and the aftermath.

The film is quiet, intense, and utterly spellbinding. It proves again that one of the greatest horrors you can portray on-screen is the simple act of two people trying to talk to each other.",1262217600,2,581,5.041666666666667
7945467,5,B00005MFIA,"Some viewers complained that the movie is boring. I was so mesmerized by it that although I caught it on one of my Fio channels at 1:00 a.m., I had to watch it to the end, at 3:30 a.m. This is one of the most compelling of Bergman's scripts. Although he had often dealt with remorse before, I don't remember him focusing with such intensity on a young girl--Marianne's daughter--the innocent victim of her mother's faithlessness. Whenever Marianne remembers how she wrecked her daughter's life through her reckless affair with the director Bergman, her anguish is so searing and visceral that it seems the world has just stopped breathing. It is here that Lena Endre's riveting performance transcends even its excellent self, reaching a spiritual depth (or is it height?) that holds us captive in her and our own humanity. The wages of sin is a cliche that doesn't begin to unpack the poignancy of the mother's regret, always mixed with a devilish sense of irresponsibility which sweeps her along to further exploits of adultery. She is helplessly trapped in her affair while her daughter is left alone and irreparably damaged.  It is the painful rift between mother and daughter that gives this drama its profound tragic sense, akin to the relentless familial devastations of Greek tragedy.
Bergman's script surprises not only in its insight into a mother-daughter relationship, but also in its articulation of a woman's emotional world. As far as I can remember, no other work of his puts the woman's inner world front and center and explores it with lucidity, detail, and eloquence. The only question I have for Bergman--wherever he is now--concerns his view of infidelity as human fate, sealed within our human DNA. There is no Bergman without betrayal. Moreover, his betraying husbands and wives commit their betrayals almost thoughtlessly. Yes, they are often portrayed in anguished and tragic conflicts, but these conflicts kick in after the betrayal, not before. Although in our cynical culture many view adultery as trivial, I do not and neither does Bergman, but he doesn't explain it. Was she unhappy with her husband? Was she ""addicted"" to her lover? Was she attracted to ""sin"" and the inevitable suffering it brings? Betraying a husband or a wife seems to me the mother of all betrayals, and I usually want to know why people deceive their loved ones. However, I am certainly not going to get the answer from Bergman who sees betrayal as a given, an essential human element, inseparable from love.
Ullman's direction is wonderful! It illuminates this script from within and adds warmth and color to the typically bare Bergman's setting. It furthermore rounds Bergman's harsh corners without sacrificing depth or intensity.  The wind-shaped trees are so fine! And so is every piece of furniture in that room, especially the window sill where Marianne starts her astonishing story. The old director's mostly wordless reactions to Marianne's story are as artistically accomplished and moving as her shimmering verbal waterfalls. The two are  thirstily drinking each other's utterances, whether in silence or in speech, for the intimate understanding and reckoning which had heretofore escaped them.
This is a masterpiece, any way you look at it.",1240790400,4,3255,5.091760299625468
