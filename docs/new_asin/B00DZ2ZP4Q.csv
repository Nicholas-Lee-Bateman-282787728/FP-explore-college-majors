5879817,4,B00DZ2ZP4Q,"OK, the acting is bad.  I have to agree with that. But the movie was fun and I actually enjoyed it. The ladies in the film reminded me of women I have met and known. The instigating girlfriends and the ones that have your back along with the ones that just can't keep their hands off of each other.  So much drama.  It was as if the poor acting in this actually made it more real or as real as reality TV.",1390003200,,405,3.9146341463414633

I wasn't to thrill with the plot as well. I was hoping that the main character will realize how important it is to have a man in her life versus a woman, that's another subject all together.

5880000,3,B00DZ2ZP4Q,"The actors and actresses seemed a little stiff.  Dialogue seemed forced, didn't flow naturally.  Woul like to see part 2 to see the out come.",1394841600,,141,4.6
5880001,1,B00DZ2ZP4Q,"I applaud the the writer's goal of creating art and entertainment for the intended audience. However, most of the acting was awful. Notably, the worst scene was the ""police intervention"" scene. Also, the lack of research of the actors in their roles reveals a laziness that causes the movie to lag. Independent actors aren't exempt from mastering their arts, are they? The AJ character and his wife gave believable performances.",1394150400,3,428,5.128571428571429

8599361,5,B00DZ2ZP4Q,"I loved this part 1. I did however feel that Keisha's sister AJ was being way too aggressive.  That character needs to tone it down. I didn't like how she was made that her sister turned out to be into women as well. It's like what a hypocrit. The heart wants what the heart wants. You can't live for everyone else. You just gotta live for yourself, and your own happiness. Overall the movie was good, and the sexual scenes were well done.",1497484800,,439,4.289156626506024
