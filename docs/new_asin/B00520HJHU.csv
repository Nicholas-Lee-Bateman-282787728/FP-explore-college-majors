Just great Ashtanga flow yoga.
Video is in a nice setting, and relys on 9 excellent students from her class as the models, which feels more like a real yoga class than most yoga videos.
Most videos just have one model or the instructor shown.
Explanations make sense and she has suggestions for advanced students who need a bit more.

Video moves at a good pace to get you warmed up and limber.

If I can't make it to a real Yoga class, this is an excellent alternative.

I also enjoyed ""Yoga for Surfers"" but those are tougher and longer. This one is more often what I need and have time for.

Another good thing- the DVD is just a simple video.  No annoying intros or safety boilerplate from lawyers.",1336003200,,731,4.385185185185185

Her soothing voice is wonderful to listen to and the practice itself is challenging and inspiring.  I enjoyed it so much I've shared it with many friends!",1316476800,,307,4.5636363636363635
