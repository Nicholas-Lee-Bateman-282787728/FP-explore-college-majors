8123468,1,B000FILUJ2,WTF!!! What a CRAPPY waste of time. Poor Todd Bridges. Again.....CRAP!!! I cant believe they even call this a movie. This is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. What a TURD!!!,1337731200,2,181,4.352941176470588
8123469,1,B000FILUJ2,I have seen a lot of stupid vampire movies. After this one I will not purchase any more that's not from this century. It totally sucked.,1253404800,,136,4.269230769230769
8123470,1,B000FILUJ2,I bought this movie knowning it was going be bad. When I looked at the dvd it said Todd Bridges stars in this film and I knew it was going suck. Well I never got that far. I bought far better movies to watch then this crapfest. The movie was bad but did not really interst me.,1240617600,2,276,3.8596491228070176
8123471,1,B000FILUJ2,i know it's bad. I the blood looks too red like strawberry syrup instead of fx blood. But you have to give the vampires credit for least picking ghetto neighborhoods to munch on people.,1195430400,3,185,4.470588235294118
8123472,3,B000FILUJ2,"By all means this a real ""B"" movie, I mean the actors can't act,the story is so-so,however that being said the music or ton of it is not bad and it's kind of a fun movie to watch,there's some good gore in it and the movie flows along at a good pace.

So if your looking for a brainless vampire movie to watch than you may have a good time with this picture.",1157241600,,357,3.8904109589041096
8123473,2,B000FILUJ2,"I have to agree with the other reveiwer that this was done by people who seemed bored and thought 'let's make a horror film'. I give one more star though, because it's not as bad as other such shot on video movies.

The acting is poor. The story, over-all is okay, but there's some major flaws logically... a young dude sees vampires attacking people in a car-park at night. He has to convince his friends, and the vampires want to stop them.

There's the problem. These vampires feast so often, and in such public places that they're not going to remain 'unknown' for very long.

Even when the vampires dump a body in the water, it floats. They see it floats, and just drive off! One might think that they'd at least weigh it down.

The FX weren't that great, but I've seen worse. It's not as sexy a low-budget vampire film like ""Night Fangs"" or ""Dark Town"" (which have equally poor acting and script), which is why I gave it less stars than those films. It's not scary, either.

Of some interest to trivia buffs, this has Todd Bridges from the 80s tv series ""Diff'rent Strokes""",1153353600,4,1079,4.456852791878172
8123474,1,B000FILUJ2,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Actually, it was so horrible I didn't watch the whole thing. This movie looks like it was made by a bunch of people who were bored. You can totally tell it's homemade, the ""transitions"" into vampires are performed terribly (when their eyes change color, the people hold their hands up to their eyes and you can tell they are putting in contacts), and the story doesn't even fit the description given at this site. A group of vampires rent a house and kill people. That's about how complicated this movie gets. It's beyond being funny in a stupid way. I can't believe this movie was made. Unless you want to pay to see something you could have made better yourself, don't get this movie.",1152748800,8,739,4.4411764705882355
