1414,4,0005123968,"My 18 month old loves this video. She dances, marches, and ""sings"" along.  She wants to watch it every day, and I don't even mind because the songs are catchy, classic and its fun to see her having fun. She'll literally turn the TV off during Barney, Wiggles and other music videos for kids...she doesn't really care for TV at all but the ""Cedarmont Kids"" is the one thing she will watch! (We like ""Toddler Tunes"" and ""Silly Songs"" though, by the same singing, dancing kids just a tad better but I had to buy this for some variety on the tube!)",1042329600,12,544,4.333333333333333
1415,5,0005123968,We bought this dvd for viewing on a road trip but it has become a staple in our 2 year old's life.  Not all of the songs have actual motions but there are children laughing and singing and moving around and she is enthralled.  She sings along with the show but also sings them on her own throughout the day.  We have more of the Cedarmont videos and I love the fact that they do not repeat songs on different videos.,1015113600,22,416,4.111111111111111

1422,5,0005123968,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my one year old niece, so I have not actually seen the cd yet. (I will watch it with her and probably enjoy it as much as she will however.) My niece loves music and likes to watch little children on tv or videos, so I am sure this will be a big hit.",1480982400,,291,3.7096774193548385

1430,3,0005123968,"Actually, the CD has great actions and songs.  Unfortunately, cannot alter the order in which they play on a play list, or incorporate it with other songs, so it is of limited value to us in our Sunday School ministry.",1453766400,,218,4.45
1431,3,0005123968,Songs are good but need a bit more diversity.  I would like my kids to see other kids that look like them in more than just a random passing image.,1448150400,2,147,3.9

1446,4,0005123968,"Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  The content is great, however for the money it needs a few more songs.  Some just repeated themselves too much.  Should have added a couple more.  Still, it is worth the four stars if you want good Christian content for your kids.",1393286400,,279,4.63265306122449
1447,5,0005123968,My granddaughter wore one of these out already. It's fun to watch and sing along to. Much better than some of the junk for children.,1392681600,,132,4.32
1448,1,0005123968,This is not a sing along dvd and it was difficult to understand some of the words being sung. I would not recommend it.,1386633600,,119,4.0

1450,5,0005123968,My one year old grandson watches this over and over and over and over. It always brings a smile to his face when I put it on for him. It was well worth the money just to see that smile and watch him dance to his favorite songs.,1377734400,,227,3.75

1453,5,0005123968,"I bought this to use in my Sunday School class and the kids love it.  I was hoping for my hand movements to go with the songs and that's not what this DVD is, but the kids were still mesmerized by it!",1367452800,,200,3.761904761904762
1454,4,0005123968,Bought it for my grandchildren.  I had it for my daughter when she was young but gave it away after she out grew it.  Now I had to have it for my grandchildren to enjoy.  My daughter and I still sing the songs from it and she is 17 yrs old now.,1364947200,,244,3.6538461538461537
1455,5,0005123968,"My daughter (2 years) absolutely loves this dvd!  She asks to watch almost daily.  She loves her ""Bible Songs"" as she calls them.  Highly recommended!",1348790400,,150,4.92
1456,5,0005123968,"My 4 year old loves this video. He knew 3 or 4 of the 17 songs on the video, and I was unsure how he'd take to the whole 17 song video...  Many times these videos are not produced well... But my fears were washed away after my son sat through the first viewing happily, and then wanted to watch the video AGAIN right away.  He watched it a second time (30 mins is the perfect legnth) and was content. Good choice on my part, this is a GREAT video.

It's interesting to see the kids in the video, who are all great performers, by the way... while the clothes are clearly from 1995 (i guessed 1994), the production, song choices and approach are 100% timeless. This video does not show its age. It's that good.

I recommend it for older toddlers and preschoolers...Kindergartners would also enjoy it.. ages 2 to 6 would be a perfect target audience. They are all Christian songs that Christian kids will love. Even my wife and I enjoyed the joy in the songs.

Highly recommended!",1322956800,4,977,4.375690607734807
1457,5,0005123968,My 2-yr old daughter loves these videos and excitedly sings along.  Well done!  It's real kids doing what kids like to do.,1322179200,,122,4.5
1458,5,0005123968,My two 17 month old babies LOVE this DVD and recently they are starting to immitate the moves and sing a long a few words in the song. One of them now likes to start our nighttime prayer with a song (Jesus love the little one like me)The only thing they can say from it til now is me me me and you you you you:-),1316995200,,312,3.742424242424242
1459,3,0005123968,The singing and actions are ok. Was a little disappointed that the singing and the lip movement does not always match.,1314662400,,118,4.666666666666667
1460,4,0005123968,"I needed something Christian to keep my 1 year old daughter occupied while I worked, and this DVD has worked like a charm. She sits through the whole thing. She loves it when we sing the songs back to her when on a long drive or even when she's just generally cranky. Basically, the DVD has served the purpose for which it was chosen. We are very happy with the purchase. We recently bought another collection in the Cedarmont series that has 100 songs in it. Waiting to try it out.",1311465600,,482,4.3076923076923075
1461,5,0005123968,"The song selections are pretty good - they seem to stick in your head for better or worse.  Truth be told, I remember most of the songs from Sunday School and bible camp when I was a kid (e.g., This Little Light of Mine, Father Abraham, I'm in the Lord's Army, etc.) In all, it's good ""wholesome"" Christian music sung by colorful, busy kids doing busy kid stuff which captures any toddler/pre-schooler's attention.  And I'd much rather my kids be memorizing the lyrics on this dvd than the stuff they might hear on the radio. We've already worn out one dvd, and we're on our second.  This is definitely a favorite in our house.",1293840000,10,627,4.482456140350878

1464,5,0005123968,"My 2 year old granddaughter and I have watched this DVD for a while now and she simply loves it! The purchase was for a relative who just turned 1 year old. He loves it, too! Lots of fun and we enjoy singing along with the kids in the video. (action packed)",1236384000,7,257,3.9615384615384617
1465,4,0005123968,"Our 20-month-old and 4.5-year-old love this video that contains many of the favorite Bible songs I remember from my childhood.  The music and singing is good quality, and the scenes behind the music are interesting -- children playing, acting out some of the words, like rock climbing during ""Climb up Sunshine Mountain"" -- even a farm full of animals during the Noah song.

Unfortunately, only a few of the songs feature all of the actions (hand motions and body movement) that make these songs favorites for children.  It's such a shame, because the primary reason I bought this DVD was to encourage full-body participation and movement instead of passive viewing.

Still, the production is good-quality (not overproduced and grating like the DVD of the same name by Golden Books).  When our kids leave it on and walk away, it actually makes decent background music, as children's music goes.

To be sure, this is the best children's music DVD we own (yes, even more popular with our kids than the Wiggles) -- that is, until we find a DVD of action Bible songs that actually features the actions.",1114819200,27,1098,4.8449197860962565

I know that he'll love it just as much as the other children did.  There's a whole series to get, and while they can be very corny, the little ones love them and don't care in the least.
