8683343,5,B00OE9NISO,"Excellent coming of age type movie where most of the passion is implied and felt by the viewer, but not explicitly seen. Filmed primarily along the European beach, a young man must reckon with the ecstasy and calamity of having 3 relationships at the same time. His ultimate solution comes as a complete surprise and leaves you wishing for a sequel.",1481587200,,349,4.737704918032787
