8533584,2,B0090ZOMNW,"The Video quality is very poor, the camera is always fixed without zooming. G Govan in most of the video is not displayed on the scene because the camera is static and distant.
It's a shame that this kind of videos are included in a boxset. However the quality of the musicians is very good ..... As a fan of GPS and AFJP is a shame to have this video.",1363737600,2,352,4.042857142857143
