29767,5,0769721036,"This 1983 Butterfly production of the Italian Radio and Television from Arena Di Verona is excellent. The DVD transfer from the original material is seamless - the video is vivid and clear, the audio (although only 2 channel) is dynamic and balanced. I also listened through my surround sound receiver's 5-channel stereo mode and felt like being in the middle of the Arena.
Now for the real treat: do not believe Amazon's editorial review that there are no opera superstars in this production. On the contrary this recording features the fantastic bulgarian singer Raina Kabaivanska, who is undeniably the best Butterfly performer in recent history and one of the greatest Puccini singers overall. It is a pity that she is not recognized as a diva in the US. But thanks to this wonderful DVD the american opera fans will be able to enjoy her magnificent singing and be emotionally dazzled by her brilliant acting. Her captivating performance in the final scene will leave you mesmerized.
Highly recommended!",1077840000,28,1007,5.0359281437125745
29768,5,0769721036,"Whatever other performances of ""Butterfly"" you might have in whatever medium they might have been preserved, this performance is simply one that you must have.  To a person, the performances are fabulous both in the richness of the voices and in the quality of the characterizations.  The venue allows for a large and inventive production, the sets are tastefully lush, the sound is vibrant, and the videography is superb.  As has been said in other reviews, it does require a degree of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" for one to imagine Ms. Kabaivanska as a fifteen year old girl but it doesn't take long for her to charm the viewer so that it is hardly noticed.  She truly wins one's heart as the loving, faithful, brave--but tragic--heroine. Again, if you miss having this recording, you will have missed a captivating and memorable experience.",1075507200,15,849,4.957746478873239

Esta versin es sin lugar a dudas la mejor Butterfly que jams he visto en versiones tanto en DVD como en Videos. Un solo pequeo detalle me llam la atencin respecto al tenor; a veces quita la vista de donde debe tenerla, en especial en el duo nupcial, parece que mira al director de lado sin girar la cabez; este es un detalle insignificante pues su actuacin y canto es impecable. La Butterfly es por otro lado perfecta, muy convincente y de gran calidad tanto vocal como teatral. Recomiento altamente este DVD.

29770,5,0769721036,"Dear fellow music lover! I am so happy Amazon is bringing this title to us!
This video is filmed in the Arena di Verona, with the MAGNIFICENT singer and actress Raina Kabaivanska!
This Madama Butterfly has  everything you could ask for: Excelent singers (Kabaivanska and Nazzareno  Antinori as Pinkerton plus the cast), it is wonderfully directed by  Maurizio Arena, and the film  is so well done, that you can actually  appreciate all the ""flavors"" of the orquestration, while at the  same time, hear very clearly every detail of the what's being sung...
The  regie is FANTASTIC! Costumes and sets are impecable, and EVERY movement has  a reason for being there... it is SO wonderful (I hope my enthusiasm can  inspire you to see it!),
If you are someone who enjoys opera, you will be  flabergasted with this version...
If you are into opera, the close ups  are so wonderful that, let me tell you, it is like getting your own private  lesson from Kabaivanska and Antinori!
This version is by far my  favourite of all the Butterfly's that I have seen. Will delight very  knowleageable people, opera amateurs, as well as people who know nothing  about opera (but this one will ""hook them up""!  :-)
I do not  get tired of watching it... every note, every movement is rich and deeply  full of meaning.
Hope you enjoy it (and learn from it) as much as I  do!

29777,5,0769721036,I friend on mine recommended me this DVD as I was looking for a great performance of Madama Butterfly. His praise for this presentation is short of the impression I got after enjoying the DVD. It is not hiperbolic to express the thrill and emotion conveyed by Kaibaivansk. What a great soprano and what a spotless performance. Tenor Antonori also plays a fine role though sometimes his constant look at the director sort of disperse one's attention. In those days he was still young and perhaps it was his first Butterfly. The rest of the cast also very good. A 1983 performace to be enjoyed by many generations. A delight. I am open to similar recommendations in this same quality line.,1316390400,2,687,4.68595041322314
29778,3,0769721036,"I ordered this performance of Madama Butterfly based on another reviewer's positive comments, because I was looking for a version that has acceptable qualities visually, musically, and dramatically to make available to students in my Intro to Opera course.  The production is visually nice in terms of the sets and costumes; however, I found the large number of singers on stage in the first act during the wedding to be chaotic and distracting.  Every movement of feet on the stage can be heard.  Musically, I feel the performance is adequate -- not great, but not bad either.  I was most disappointed in the acting and dramatic delivery of the singers.  I found the acting to be very one-dimensional (especially Kaibaivanska as Butterfly), flat, and lacking in emotion.  The prinicipal singers had their eyes on the conductor so much that very little came across as natural or believable.",1275955200,,890,5.020408163265306

29781,4,0769721036,"I had once seen this opera a good while ago, checking it out from a library, wanting to learn the Madama Butterfly story -- and found that I really loved Raina Kabaivanska's performance as ""Cio-Cio-San""/""Butterfly"" to be spectacular.

Eventually returned the video, wanting my own copy, so I eventually (later) bought it by going on Amazon.

This opera by Puccini is a classic in operatic tragedies, and Raina K's incredible acting (she's just as delicate and vulnerable as the young woman she played!) makes this an incredible video.

(I also liked the optional subtitling, and the other features that come with it being in the DVD format.)

The story is a great story, the acting and singing are great, and the DVD is in good shape, a worthy recording medium for a classic opera done by excellent performers.  Four stars, as usual for an opera (*tempted* to rate it five stars, though -- four are enough), or maybe I should actually give it five stars, hard to tell, really good stuff.",1236211200,,987,4.748538011695906
29782,4,0769721036,"This is a very well sung and very well presented Madama Butterfly. However, in agreement with others, I believe this Madama Butterfly should not be a first or only Butterfly.  As well done as it is, it clearly does not represent what Puccini had in mind; instead it reflects the thinking of director Robert Wilson who tightly limits and controls the movements, actions, and appearance of all the players.

As he helpfully explains in the Extras part of the DVD, Wilson believes the kaleidoscope of colors and movements in a typical opera production distracts attention from the music.  His abstract, serious, static, and strictly stylized approach here is intended to focus the audience on the music and away from busy presentation.  Interestingly, Wilson also says he does not start from the music but wraps the music around his vision of light and movement, sometimes demanding that characters move counter to the rhythm of the music.  As others explain, the audience cannot passively follow the story but has to impute what the characters are thinking from their very subtle and limited movements.  Indeed, Wilson seems much more concerned with affecting the thought processes of his audience than actually telling Butterfly's story.  His way certainly causes an audience to think and is creative if only because it is so different.  Nevertheless, I suspect that this unusual Butterfly works well mainly, perhaps only, because of its high level of execution, both musically and on stage.

There is a subtext to Wilson's approach that is not explained.  It is a ""widely known secret"" that Wilson is gay, and some of that interest affects this Butterfly.  The most obvious manifestation is a heavy focus on male characters in what is a quintessentially female story.  For example, Wilson follows Butterfly's son in the Dream sequence, not Butterfly herself.  Even at the final climax, Wilson focuses more on the son and Pinkerton reaching out to each other over a dying Butterfly than Butterfly's death.  While the gay subtext is obvious, at least to me, it is merely a subtext.  This is not a gay Madama Butterfly.  Homophobes need not be concerned about corrupting themselves or others by watching it anymore than one would be corrupted by watching a Benjamin Britten opera. Art is art.

Having praised this DVD, I must admit that it is not my favorite Madama Butterfly on DVD.  My favorite is a recently released, 1997 Opera Australia production, also starring Cheryl Barker (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madama-Butterfly-Opera-Australia-Cheryl-Barker-Jay-Hunter-Morris/dp/B0015NR2F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madama Butterfly / Opera Australia, Cheryl Barker, Jay Hunter Morris</a>).  It too is very well done, both musically and on stage.  The Opera Australia production also has imaginative lighting effects, and the acting in it is so good that when the music is muted, the second and third acts actually hold interest as a stage play with subtitles alone.  (Puccini forbid!)  Ironically, what I personally prefer in Wilson's 2003 Butterfly over the 1997 version are two auditory features, not some aspect of staging.  The acoustics of the Muziektheater in Amsterdam, are better than those of the Sydney Opera House and Cheryl Barker's voice, which has continued to improve over her career, has yet more power than before.",1227052800,8,3372,5.34469696969697
29783,5,0769721036,This production is in Verona Italy and seeing the stadium there is really something. The leads are very well sung and acted.,1226448000,2,124,4.681818181818182
29784,4,0769721036,"This 1983 open-air performance is a thoroughly professional, traditionally staged Madama Butterfly likely to please most admirers of this opera. Tenor Nazzareno Antinori is a real surprise - he does some wonderful singing, especially in the third Act. His 'Addio, fiorito asil' is quite something! Beautiful phrasing and a confident, melting expressiveness once he gets warmed up. Kaibaivanska not so much - I don't understand some opera fans' devotedness to this singer. And not only fans, she's a singer greatly respected by her colleagues around the world. I've seen her Tosca and Butterfly. She gets the job done, explicitly at times, but her singing lacks character. Plenty of rubenesque tone, not a lot of color; yet, when she turns it on, the colors she creates with her singing can be captivating. Her singing is inconsistent - one moment quite beautiful, the next pretty boring. There are occasional intonation problems in the top notes. It is hard, however, to fault her Butterfly, at least in this recorded performance, but for a peculiar wooden quality to her singing at times, overtly careful, technically assured, but somewhat colorless. Maurizio Arena's conducting is staid and predictable, but not without merit. The Verona orchestra responds lithely, always conscious of the actors on stage, to Arena's credit. The staging is what we've seen before, middle-of-the-road agreeable but nothing defining. Sound is excellent throughout, thanks I'm sure in large part to Brian Large's expert direction of a film project which never fails to impress with its purposefulness. I agree with the reviews remarking on the excellent closeup shots - the wonders of the video age! Scotto's Butterfly breaks your heart, and Price had tremendous vocal reserves to endow her version with immortality - Raina Kaibaivanska falls short on both counts, but gives a reliable performance overall of a notoriously vocally dangerous role. The physical demands alone of the role caused L. Price to quit it early on. If a truly fine filmed version of Butterfly exists, I haven't found it. Still, lovers of Puccini's enduring masterpiece will find some good moments to champion in this DVD version. Tenor Nazzareno Antinori and director Brian Large commit impeccable work and deserve kudos. Subtitles included.",1163808000,7,2298,5.298630136986302
29785,4,0769721036,"Criticisms about this ""Butterfly"" are foolisheness. What a marvellous night when all the vocal performers was nothing less than shinning. Antinori,a very diligent singer here,just watching all conductor's markings,at no time losing sight of the character's poetry and spontaneity. His performance is a overpowering one. Saccomani sings an exemplary Sharpless as well. To my personal taste,Jankovic has a stiff voice but was a very proper Suzuki on this Dvd. Raina Kabaivanska!(let me warn you;she's tall,like a basketball player geisha)I was completely fixed on,from her entrance on ""Quanto cielo!""(if you have a fine TV,just watch Antinori's drop eyes in this moment),then audience to get enthusiastic about her sweetness and brightness top notes above all female chorus.""Bimba dagli occhi"" was a touching experience even to me,always suspicious on Puccini's musical indulgences. Act II,one more break in ""Scuota quela fronda?"",'cause Raina just holds so passionated ""He's returned and he loves me!"",that people on Verona really go to mad. Besides,she proves herself a great actress on final scene. The only problem about that night was mistakes and tuneless horns,harps,too much noisy percussion,...What about shades,dynamics,...?I would like that players was been a bit more scrupulous all in all. Well...That's alive,anyway.",1104278400,19,1328,5.815384615384615
29786,2,0769721036,"Todava no he encontrado una versin de Butterfly que me resulte satisfactoria. Al adquirir sta esperaba, por las estrellas que luca, que pudiera ser la versin que hace falta. Sin embargo, con excepcin del bellsimo jardn japons que logra ambientar plenamente la accin, el resto de ella es muy insatisfactorio. El sonido es deficiente, dependiendo de la posicin de los micrfonos ambientales a veces las voces se pierden. Por otra parte, en general, tambin resulta demasiado metlico. El desempeo de Kabaivanska, altamente profesional, es tambin muy inadecuado. Se supone que Butterfly tiene 15 aos y K. representa tres veces ms. Todos los esfuerzos del maquillador resultan insuficientes para ocultar su excesiva madurez. Tampoco la acompaa el fsico por lo alta y maciza que resulta para representar una adolecente japonesa. Su emisin, trabajada con mucha tcnica, tampoco es concordante con la edad de la protagonista. Sus desplazamientos por el bello escenario, por todas las inadecuaciones ya anotadas,a pesar de sus esfuerzos, parecen ms un remedo de una geisha. En todo caso, hay que destacar su dominio de escena y su seguridad para coordinarse con el director. En este ltimo aspecto, el desempeo del tenor y el bartono resultan muy pobres, preocupndose tanto de lograrlo que se olvidan que la pera tambin requiere actuacin. La voz de Antinori, con un timbre demasiado metlico en los agudos, tambin resulta insuficiente para el papel, especialmente cuando debe enfrentar el registro medio y bajo. La direccin de Arena, quiz por el requerimiento de un conjunto demasiado numeroso por tratarse de una presentacin en espacio abierto, pasa por momentos en que pareciera no lograr una adecuada concertacin. En definitiva, los amantes de Madama Butterfly debemos seguir esperando una versin satisfactoria en DVD.",1093824000,7,1807,5.321678321678322
29787,4,0769721036,"Esta es una muy bella version de la opera de Puccini. Primero por la bella puesta en escena que plantea la Arena de Verona, con ese jardin natural omnipresente. Luego, por la grandisima creacion (en lo vocal y en lo fisico) que hace del papel principal RAINA KABAIVANSKA, de vision obligada. Ademas aparece muy bien secundada por JANKOVIC (Suzuki) y FERRARA (Sharpless), que estan muy interesantes en sus personajes, y por el mas discreto, aunque suficiente, ANTINORI (B.F. Pinkerton) La orquesta y el coro responden a gran nivel, y solo un cierto sonido enlatado (provocado seguramente por el hecho de que el espectculo sea en un gran recinto al aire libre) parece ser e unico punto discutible de este dvd. Muy recomendable desde cualquier punto de vista.",1086825600,4,756,4.960629921259843
29788,4,0769721036,"Okay, so although there are a few DVD recordings of butterfly, none of them are all that great. According to me, this one is one of the better picks.
Big kudos to Kabaivanska... she sings and acts a tremendous butterfly. She doesn't quite pull of some of the high notes, especially at the end of butterfly's entrance and the first act duet, but for the most part she sings really well, and she's in character more than any other butterfly I have seen on screen. Un bel di is her best moment.... she's wonderfully emotive and sings her heart out.
Antinori can sing Pinkerton well enough, but his stage presence is wooden, and he keeps looking at the camera nervously which is terribly annoying, especially during the first act duet, when kabaivanska is doing a wonderful job of it. Both suzuki and sharpless are good.
Although this recording cannot even come close to the CD recordings by Scotto/Barbirolli (what a magnificent butterfly she was!!) or Callas/Karajan, I consider it the best we have so far on DVD.",1082332800,17,1011,4.7175141242937855
29789,1,0769721036,"This Butterfly got me completely dissapointed when I watched on video some years ago. The only thing I really liked (and I mean really) was the orchestral sound. An open-air stage like Arena de Verona needs a bigger orchestra than usual and the sound of that big mass of sound was really well and carefully carried out by Maurizio Arena.
For the rest, the only thing I can say is that I don't understand how italian audiences have so little respect for Puccini and his masterwork, 'Butterfly'. Not only in this DVD recording, but also in the equally horrible 'Butterfly' in La Scala by Hayashi/Maazel, you have to deal with a noisy public and the feeling that no one is listening to the music. Nor I understand their satisfaction applauses at the end (did they really enjoy?).
Raina Kavaibanska can probably be a great soprano, despite her harsh tone, but always looks arrogant, unsensitive, overacted and disagreeable on stage. The only place I liked her was in a 'Trovatore' in a Domingo/Karajan production in Vienna, but in general she tends to act like an old-fashioned prima donna who wants to gain prominence everywhere. And that attitude is specially unfortunate in a role like Butterfly, so a delicate woman. It's really horrible to watch Kabaivanska behaving like a sergeant in Act I .
The other singers can do nothing to better it up, but in most cases they even don't seem to want to do it. Antinori has nothing of a romantic character and does his acting job plainly and unexpressively. Saccomani is also plain and dull.
I love this opera and do not want to watch it acted like this, so I ask to the other reviewers: Did you really think that a better 'Butterfly' couldn't be done when you gave it FIVE stars?
Rafael, Madrid.",1080950400,19,1737,4.6797385620915035
29790,5,0769721036,"In Act I, Pinkerton describes Butterfly as ""bewitching with her innocent arts.  Delicate and fragile as blown glass, in stature, in bearing she resembles a figure on a painted screen, but, as from her background of glossy lacquer with a sudden movement she frees herself like a butterfly, she flutters and settles with quiet grace . . ..""
  Critics from Euroope agree those attributes are expressed to perfection by Bulgarian soprano, Raina Kabaivanska.  ""Incomparable,"" is the word most often used to describe her interpretation.  Far from ""unknown,"" she has been acclaimed for her over 400 performances of this role.  For Butterfly and other operas, the beautiful Kabaivanska has been titled, ""Queen of opera melodrama.""
  It is our great loss that the cast filmed in the DVD is unknown in the U.S.  We must look to Europe to know that they are all artists of the first magnitude.  Mezzo=soprano, Eleanora Jankovic, appears in many operas, and her performance as Suzuki is among her most famous roles.  Her voice is as rich and true as is her evident devotion to Cio Cio Can:  Butterfly.  Lorenzo Saccomani, Sharpless here, has had many years as one of the most sought after baritones in opera.  The same is true of tenor Nazzareno Antinari.  Do not overlook Maestro Maurizio Arena!  He is very sensitive to the musical nuances of Puccini.
  Although this tragic heroine is age 15 years in Act I, and no more than 19 years in Act III, the viewer MUST know that Puccini was well aware this role could never be sung by any young girl.  If the listener expects to hear a teen singing Butterfly, or that none but Japanese should sing any but the three Caucasian roles, this recording is not for you.  If you seek the live performance nearest to perfection, this is your recording.
  The lyrical beauty of Madama Butterfly can be misleading.  Its melodic flow is stunning.  Even the recitatives seem melodic.  It is deceptive in that the role of Butterfly is exceedingly difficult.  The former Geisha must evolve from an innocent young girl, adoring of her betrothed, Lt. Pinkerton, in the first act, to a stubbornly believing young mother, certain her beloved will return ""when the robins finally nest in America.""  In these acts, Butterfly is pressed to changing emotions as sung in her nearly constant presence on stage.
  The third act is the most demanding of all.  While the great Kabaivanska is superb in Acts I and II, it is in the third act she accomplishes her own magic.  From a deep well of vocal reserve and character portrayal, she leads the audience through the most heart breaking series of realizations.  Her first fear is that Pinkerton is dead.  We share her fear.  But, Pinkerton lives, and we share the enormous relief Butterfly knows.  The relief is short lived when she realizes he will not return.  There is a brief moment of respite, and suddenly she knows the lady in the garden is Pinkerton's wife.  With Butterfly, we believe all is over for her.  There is no time for a breath of relief when the final agony seizes Butterfly, and us, and she knows the entire answer:  they want to take everything away from her, even her son.  There is no vocal relief for the artist.  Until the end, and we hear her final aria, ""Tu, Tu, Tu, . . . "" we must wonder where this artist has kept such a reserve of vocal and emotional power.  We are as emotionally spent as Butterfly, and all because of the incomparable performance of Raina Kabaivanska, who becomes, before our very eyes and ears, Cil Cio San, Butterfly.
  Technicians marvel at the glorious dynamic ranges of this artist.  Lovers of opera marvel at the glorious voice as well as her ability to interpret a role.  As one critic from Italy wrote of La Kabaivanska, ""One never knows where the sublime singer ends and the great actress begins.  They are as one.""
