3829339,4,B001XW7IDQ,"The original American Gladiators still eclipses the ""reboot"" version by leaps and bounds.

Whereas the original was difficult, but not impossible, the reboot seemed more intent on flashiness than actual competition, making events near impossible to complete.

Fans of the original American Gladiators, and the International Gladiators fondly remember the colourful personalities of both contender and Gladiator alike.  The show gained instant credibility with mainstream sports announcers in the broadcast booth.

Of course, fans of professional body building and the Weider magazines would already be familiar with the Gladiators, this just offers fans a chance to see the personalities of these fine athletes.  While the first season focused more on the ""gimmick"" personalities of their code-names, later seasons would allow the Gladiators to show their real personalities.

While the over the top nature of the show brought criticism from some, the legitimate competition from whistle to whistle cannot be denied.

The unusual nature of the events challenged even some of the best athletes, pulled from nationwide open try-outs.

Although not the complete first season of the show, fans of this show hope that the popularity of this set will lead to more sets.

The American Gladiators has always been a cult favourite, and Shout! Factory has released other far more obscure sets to DVD, starting with smaller sets, but later releasing more and more as demand grows.

There is no other physical televised sports event on the air today that matches what The American Gladiators offered.",1326153600,3,1588,5.41869918699187

3829342,5,B001XW7IDQ,"I believe most of us are simply surprised it took this long for them to release this series. It would be an understatement to say that I was totally thrilled at finding out it finally was immortalized in the pristine quality that is the DVD format. Wow! Been checking Amazon for a few years now. Gotta say I am a little disappointed it was not the complete 1st season and truly hope that they don't handle the subsequent seasons with the same reasoning. Every episode had some really cool matches. In particular in tribute to my favorite female gladiator ""SIREN"" who met an untimely death...so young. But I am thankful this company realized what a following this series had and how many people were affected by it's airing. Thanks to Turbo for posting his notes on the features and honestly hope other gladiators will follow suite and post their feelings on this great chapter in each of their lives.
And again here's to ""SIREN"" may you find peace my sweet ""Siren"" you were a great inspiration to us all.
Sincerely, Manny in Tampa, Fl.",1264982400,2,1035,4.630434782608695
3829343,5,B001XW7IDQ,"I managed to get my hands on this DVD set and watched it the other night.  It was such a throwback to being in front of the TV watching the show as a kid.

First, it's amazing how much changed over the seasons, yet how much stayed the same.  The first 13 episode recap was a good way to get past the early medieval look to the show.  I thought the production values of those first episodes was pretty cheap, and I'm glad they decided to spend more money for the second half.  Once you do get to the last half of the first season, things pick up.

The video quality is actually pretty good too considering how it was filmed.  I was impressed with how ""new"" it looked.  I don't know if any restoration was done, but the second half looked pretty darn good for it's age.

The one thing I really loved about this set though were the audio commentaries by the 3 gladiators.  Dan ""Nitro"" Clark, Jim ""Laser"" Starr, and Raye ""Zap"" Hollitt.  I have to say that they are better than a lot of other commentaries I've listened to, just because they are so natural and casual.  The gladiators go into specific details on how the show was in it's first year, the different personalities of the other gladiators, and what some of them are up to now.  Also, giving some inside info on the contestants and the backstage decisions.  What I liked the most was just the interaction between the 3 of them, it was like sitting on the couch with them and just chit-chatting with friends.  Sometimes I would forget to pay attention to the show, because I was listening to one of their stories.  It's kind of a ""fly on the wall"" feeling...like you shouldn't be listening, but it's good stuff, and they are really funny.  I'm also glad the production company didn't censor them...there are some pretty frank topics, and cursing, which I thought was great.

Some things I learned from them:

That ""Assault"" was the gladiator's least favorite event...because they didn't get to do much, and the only punishment for being shot at was messed up hair!

The rules for ""Powerball"" and other full contact events were changed back and forth frequently from being allowed to tackle contestants to only being allowed to push them.

The amount of injuries to the gladiators...which makes sense since they really had no padding.

So, I would recommend this DVD set on both the nostalgia, and the audio commentaries...totally worth it!",1251417600,5,2395,4.572769953051643
3829344,5,B001XW7IDQ,"The battle begins!  I am so excited that they have finally released ""American Gladiators"" season one on DVD.  The quality of this DVD is great and the sound is awesome.  It was so awesome to put in the DVD and see my favorite show from the 90's back in action.  The DVD lacks some cool special features, but the action makes up for it. Even the booklet that comes with the DVDs is well written and informative.  Great work Shout!  and I hope that you will release season 2 really, REALLY soon!",1247529600,,493,4.304347826086956
3829345,4,B001XW7IDQ,"Premiering in 1989, this precursor to today's reality show phenomenon pitted athletic contestants against the muscle-bound, spandex-clad American Gladiators in games for cash and prizes culminating in a tournament at the season's end.  Boasting a heroic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/theme-music/dp/B000008CUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">theme music</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B000ICM5O4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>&nbsp;composer Bill Conti, this was more than just a spectator sport, this was a show that challenged couch potatoes to prove themselves.  While the series was initially an enigma to everyone involved, including the Gladiators themselves, the competitive events and mass appeal of the Gladiators saved it from a premature demise.  Hosted by former NFL stars Joe Thiesmann (who was eventually replaced by Todd Christensen) and perennial host Mike Adamle, the first season (as with most shows) had its fair share of growing pains.  The games and props were not well designed, the Romanesque arena was dimly lit (perhaps to conceal the lack of audience members), the awarding of points was excessive, comical-looking hooded figures initially officiated the games, and the Gladiators were too often forced to stay in character (as opposed to the individual natural charisma exuded in subsequent seasons).  Although the show changed drastically throughout the first season, expect to see trademark events such as Breakthrough & Conquer, Joust, and Powerball.  The six original Gladiators who ushered in this inaugural season included;

Raye ""Zap"" Hollitt- This buxom, blonde beauty (who was unceremoniously cropped from the DVD cover image) packed femininity and brawn into a relatively small frame.  Hollitt was the only Gladiator to have a fan following prior to the show, having come off the John Ritter comedy film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skin-Deep/dp/B000063K2T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skin Deep</a>.

Michael ""Gemini"" Horton- The oldest Gladiator and considered by many as the father figure of the group, Gemini more than compensated for a lack of speed and flexibility with his unmatched intensity and brute strength.

Marisa ""Lace"" Pare- Although lacking the strength and muscularity of the other female Gladiators, the curly-haired Lace was nevertheless willing to test her mettle against any contestant willing to challenge her deceptively delicate looks.

Deron ""Malibu"" McBee- Seemingly perfectly cast as the chiseled, long-haired surfer type, Malibu failed to prove he had the athletic prowess necessary to be a true Gladiator and was gone from the show midway through the season.

Cheryl ""Sunny"" Barldinger- This statuesque stunner used her impressive size and agility to dominate contestants with relative ease while remaining true to her all-American appeal.  Unfortunately, an injury in one of the first season events sidelined her career after several episodes.

Dan ""Nitro"" Clark- Arguably the most popular Gladiator, Nitro was the tough talking braggart who always backed up his words while making the contestants earn his respect.  Clark recently wrote about his experiences on the series and his battles with personal demons in the autobiography entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/1416597328/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>.

While the first season had 26 episodes total, this 3-disc set is comprised of episodes 13 (the mid-season highlights show) through episode 26 (the Grand Championships) for a total of 14 episodes.  Shout Factory apparently wanted to keep costs down to attract a larger consumer base, thus the decision to omit the first 12 episodes.  Fortunately, the recap episode will suitably bring fans up to speed on the outcomes from the first half of the season.  Bonus features include commentaries on 4 episodes and an interview with actor and former contestant, Billy Wirth.  Hopefully, this set sells well enough to warrant further season releases featuring fan-favorite Gladiators such as Turbo, Diamond, Sabre, Tower, Ice, Hawk, and many more.  Fans who have been clamoring for DVDs of this innovative show have finally gotten their wish.  The only thing left to do now is let the games begin!",1238371200,11,4393,6.178981937602627
3829346,5,B001XW7IDQ,"Awesome set. Sad that the first half of season one is only a recap. Other than that, totally takes me back to that time.

3829349,5,B001XW7IDQ,"It's American Gladiators. The show rules, the commentary is hilarious. I just wish they'd release more seasons of the show.

Zimbob Schwartze was here.",1435536000,,151,5.291666666666667
3829350,3,B001XW7IDQ,"I was never a die hard fan of the original American Gladiators, and Im not completely sure why.  After all, I watched the remake regularly and it could be argued that American Ninja Warrior is a more extreme descendent of the show, and I love that.  Anyway, I do remember watching some episodes and enjoying them, so when I stumbled on American Gladiators - The Battle Begins for a cheap price, I grabbed it.

Right from the start, the name of the set is rather misleading.  It sounds like it has the very first episodes ever, but thats not true.  The first season consisted of two 13 episode halves, and only the second half episodes are here.  The recap episode of the first half does start things off, so we get 14 hour long episodes in this three disc set.

Each episode finds four contestants, two men and two women, facing off in a series of challenges.  Theres The Wall (a rock wall climb), Joust, Assault (contestants shooting at a target while avoiding balls shot from a Gladiator), Breakthrough and Conquer (football followed by wrestling), Power Ball (dropping balls in containers while avoiding Gladiators), and Human Cannonball (swinging to knock a Gladiator off a platform).  The contestants can win points along the way, but ultimately it all comes down to the Eliminator, in which the contestants race head to head through an obstacle course.  The points earned earlier give one of the contestants a time advantage as they try to make it through to the next round.

Yes, this is an on going contest with preliminaries, quarter finals, semi-finals, and then the winner of the half season being crowned in the finals.  But wait, for the season finale, they bring back the winners from the first half of the season and pit them against the second halfs winners in a battle of champions.

Thats the only reason to watch the recap episode  to see who those two contestants are.  Well, and to laugh at how low budget that first half season was.  Want proof?  Just look at the assault set then versus the one we are used to seeing.  They also really changed the configuration for Power Ball for the better.

Of course, the show was still a product of the late 80s with a very dated style set and hair on the Gladiators and contestants.  Why did anyone ever think that was cool?

What is fun is watching the contestants fighting these super fit gladiators.  I may be the oddball since I know the Gladiators had their fans, but I was always rooting for the contestant to score points and defeat the Gladiators they were facing.  It doesnt usually happen, so maybe its my desire to root for the underdog coming through.

In later seasons, additional events were added and a rotation of games was instituted.  Boy did this show need it.  In the 13 full episodes here, we get the same games over and over again.  It might have helped if Id spaced them out more, but I got tired of seeing the same things and longed for a little variety.  Not to say I didn't enjoy some of them.  Joust is always fun (at least to watch) and Assault is a great game.  The rock climb is interesting, and the Eliminator is thrilling.  For pure mayhem, you cant pass up Power Ball as five people are on the field with competing purposes.  Its just fun to watch.

My other issue with the set is a question of just how rewatchable it is.  With a competition show, wheres the fun in watching it again?  I cant see myself wanting to pull out these discs like I do others in my DVD collection.  Then again, in a year or two when the details are fuzzy, I might enjoy them again, just spread out more than I did this time around.  Really, I don't recommend binge watching.

The episodes are presented in their native full frame and stereo sound.  They look and sound good considering how old they are and how they were recorded, but this isn't anything that will blow your sound system away.  In the way of extras, there are commentaries on four of the episodes by gladiators Zap, Nitro, and Laser.  These are interesting at times, although they tend to ramble about their lives during the era the show was on and talk about what some of the other Gladiators are up to now.  Then again, how much can they really say about the action on the screen without being repetitive especially if they aren't the Gladiators on screen at the time?  You can certainly hear the camaraderie that formed between them when they were working on the show together.  And in an extra that makes little sense, there is a 10 minute interview with Billy Worth, an actor who was also a contestant on the show.  Why doesnt it make sense?  Because he was in the first half of the season  the part that is only presented in the recap.  However, it does make me wonder what a commentary track by contestants or an interview with more of the contestants would have sounded like.  I would have really enjoyed that.  Finally, theres a booklet with mini-biographies of all the Gladiators.

This set was certainly worth the $5 I paid for it, although Im glad I didn't pay more than that for it.  Even if I don't wind up watching it again, I enjoyed my time spent with American Gladiators - The Battle Begins.  I just should have spaced them out more so I didn't get so tired of the same elements.",1434412800,2,5237,4.4867724867724865
