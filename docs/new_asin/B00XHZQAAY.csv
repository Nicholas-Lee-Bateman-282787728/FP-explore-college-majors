7167691,2,B00XHZQAAY,"I consider this movie to be a failure. I think it could have been more successful if it followed in the shoes of other video game movies and was animated. I think they could have done more with that. They integrate certain aspects of the game series like characters, random weapons and modified weapons, but theres not much of a story here. Also, the casting wasn't very good. Some people weren't good at acting but moreover, some people just didn't fit the characters. The zombies look good and theres some decent bloodshed, but the movie is poorly directed and gets quite dull at times. Definitely not how I would have liked to have seen a Dead Rising movie come to fruition. 1.5/5",1442275200,2,683,4.60655737704918
7167692,5,B00XHZQAAY,"This movie is rather a surprise, a fantastic gem of a zombie movie that's smart and original and is faithful to the game in many ways, of course it holds it own too, there are many references to the game if you can spot them, the use of multiple weapons for one is great with some new ways of killing zombies, some of the shots are long and all in one take like as if you were in the game, very well directed with some great camera angles etc, the cast is great, Jesse Metcalfe plays the great male hero lead and Meghan Ory looks fantastic as the female lead, also great roles by Virginia Madsen and Keegan Connor Tracy, there is plenty of great bloody gory scenes, some great looking make-up work too, if your a big zombie movie fan its worth picking up, one of the best in a while along with (Wyrmwood) and fans of the game should love this too especially when spotting the references, the story is good and fun to follow, people trying to survive a zombie outbreak inside the quarantine zone is always a winner! The movie is a couple of hours long too which means you get more for your money compared to average cheap straight to DVD efforts.

7167693,5,B00XHZQAAY,"Chase (Jesse Metcalfe) is a reporter caught in a quarantine during a zombie outbreak. A drug keeps people from turning into zombies with a daily dose. Suddenly the drug has become defective and a free for all ensues as Chase teams up with Virginia Madsen and Meghan Ory as they attempt to survive zombies, gangs, and the government who want to fire bomb the zone.

This is a very funny film as Frank West (Rob Riggle) provided us with frank survivor commentary to the dismay of his host. The film showed no signs it was based on a video game. There was a nice personal touch when Madsen, who has lost a daughter ,makes a smiley face PB&J sandwich for Chase. If she had just cut the crusts off. 4 1/2 stars

I don't do video games so I had no idea what the game was so I just came at this as a movie and even though I've had it up to my neck with Zombies by now, this was pretty entertaining. I have to say that I loved Jesse Metcalfe and I really wasn't expecting too much from him at all. he looks to have had a lot of fun as the egomaniacal reporter caught behind zombie lines. The rest of the cast is pretty fun too and everyone did the job. Of course, we have a few twists that happen and I don't think we will get the resolution until ""Dead Rising: Endgame"" which comes out on 12-6-16. I am personally looking forward to it.

7167736,2,B00XHZQAAY,"Two stars to warn others. I got about three stars' worth out of the film by forcing myself to enjoy the frick out of the few scenes when the acting did actually come to, ahem, life, but mostly the time passed way-slow, or the viewer had to writhe in disgust that, again and again, character after character  reacted with such stupidity that they were deservedly outwitted by these very typical, dimwitted, mostly foot-dragging, easily killed, not-that-many, B minus zombies.  Gore was reasonable, but the bites were obviously fake from 100 feet away.  Zombie/biker ""leader"" broke the ""infection rules"" by having an intellect still running his mind after having turned.  Yeah, that's a spoiler, but you should go into this film with a lot of spoilers -- so that you can keep from feeling completely abused by this TV level production.  Lots of continuity issues; tons of poor chirography that neither human or zombie would ever be found doing outside of this film.  All kinds of moments when the characters dropped weapons for no reason, stood still for huge hunks of time as they watched the zombies come.  Not a surprise in the script.  Okay, I feel better now about the lost the time and rental fee.  Ahhhhhh.....nice to have a solid reason to write.  HA!",1446940800,,1257,4.804651162790698

7167740,3,B00XHZQAAY,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Even more than the famed scene in THE GODFATHER, Hollywood has been known for taking a dead horse and beating it to death. Once something becomes popular every major and minor studio takes that theme and runs with it. Witness the popularity of TWILIGHT and the deluge of vampire movies for a short time. Now the craze is zombies due to the popularity of THE WALKING DEAD. Most of the movies involving zombies can be terrible (see what Ive written about NAVY SEALS VS. ZOMBIES online), some aren't bad and for the most part they're kind of stuck in the middle.

DEAD RISING: WATCHTOWER falls into the middle of the pack when it comes to zombie flicks. Based on the hit game for whichever gaming system you use, the movie takes place after the initial zombie outbreak has happened. While this means we don't spend time on how and more on what to do it makes you feel as if you walked into the middle of a movie rather than the beginning. It works in some ways but doesnt in others.

Into the fray jumps Chase (Jesse Metcalf), an online reporter trying to make a name for himself and jump up to the big time. In East Mission, Oregon, with his trusted camerawoman Jordan (Keegan Connor Tracy) by his side, the duo witness an outbreak in the city. A medication to keep the zombie disease in remission is being administered to those who have been bitten but unlike the past it doesnt seem to be working. Soon patients are leaping from their beds and attacking the medical staff set up in an emergency post.

The pair take off alongside Crystal (Meghan Ory), a young woman who is infected but has her own street supply of the drug for the moment. As they escape the massacre of victims who then rise to eat the living, they come across Maggie (Virginia Madsen), a mother who was forced to kill her daughter when she turned into a zombie. Jordan gets separated from the rest and makes her way to the wall placed around the city to contain the zombies. Chase and crew head in to find the warehouse where the medication is stored.

Jordan finds the head of FEZA (Federal Emergency Zombie Agency) and tries to find out whats going on. If he cant get the situation under control it will soon fall into the hands of the military led by General Lyons (Dennis Haysbert). With only a few hours to contain the outbreak if it fails the General has orders to bomb the city.

On the inside Chase and his group find shelter and prepare to find a way to make their way to the warehouse and then to the wall. But it isn't just zombies they must contend with. A motorcycle gang that looks like they stepped out of a Mad Max movie is traveling the streets as well, looting and killing along the way. To get where they want theyll have to bypass this group while at the same time avoiding the flesh eating mass in the streets. With no clue as to the condition of the warehouse thats what they set out to do.

Betrayals and subplots involving the military, double crosses on the outside of the wall and one of the longest one take action sequences filmed the movie offers a decent nights entertainment for horror fans and zombie lovers. These are not the slow moving zombies but the runners so know that going in. Added to the movie for comic relief is coverage of the story on the local news station discusses whats happening with added commentary from Frank West (Rob Riggle), the sole survivor of the last major outbreak who tosses out advice that makes for some serious laughs.

As I said, the movie is based on the computer game and uses a number of point of view shots that make it seem as if you're in the game. The gore level is up there and the make-up varies from very good to mild. CGI blood is used throughout but not overdone. It does do a great job of showing how everyone is affected rather than just your standard zombie when you see things like police officers and clowns that have changed. Most movies don't acknowledge that uniformed workers might be a part of the zombies.

The film had that SyFy channel feel to it and in looking into it I found that it was on that channel. Im glad to report that it surpasses most of what their movies usually offer and isn't a bad movie. My one reservation is the length of the film. At 118 minutes it feels long, mostly due to the fact that they main story consists of running from spot to spot. The added features of secondary plots and new coverage don't ease the feeling of it being too long. But it does offer a nice horror flick, adds a few new things to the genre and leaves itself wide open for a sequel. But most horror films do these days. Its one worth watching for some fun but perhaps not one to revisit over and over again.",1445904000,4,4723,4.3701594533029615
7167741,4,B00XHZQAAY,"Okay, I went in expecting a terrible movie because of all the hate I saw on Amazon about it. So I used my free rental at Redbox and thought I'd give it a watch, because at least then I wouldn't have wasted money on it.
I thought the movie accurately portrayed what the games were about, Zombrex failure, don't trust the government, zombies, crazy people (which was only one group of them) but in the end I thought they did a fairly good job. They had the same memorabilia as in the game, like the little yellow Lego head. I don't understand why people hated the movie, because it's just like every other game... Zombie outbreak, make weapons, government gives a time limit before they kill everyone, group of people are crazy, survive and get out.",1445731200,9,747,4.5
7167742,1,B00XHZQAAY,"I played countless hours of Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2, Case Zero, Off the Record, and Dead Rising 3. And was very disappointed when I watched this. Even if you're a fan of zombie movies I still suggest to stay away from this film. Bland and boring

Pros: Sorry, there's none here.

Cons: Plot is messy, characters are boring, and was annoyed when Frank West had an exact opposite personality then the video game. Also the ending is really unsatisfying.

I recommend this movie for people that like to watch crappy movies with their friends. Or if you want to watch a zombie movie with zero expectations. The reason is that some people actually like this movie, when I was reading Facebook comments and amazon reviews. It seemed that the fans hate it and people who never played Dead Rising would like the movie. So overall don't watch if you're a fan or a possible Halloween flick if you already watched all the good ones.",1445731200,,923,4.581818181818182

7167744,3,B00XHZQAAY,Typical B Zombie flick.,1445558400,,23,5.0
7167745,4,B00XHZQAAY,"Its a solid movie.  Probably a bit outside of what lovers of Zombie films would be looking for.

Its not a big budget blockbuster but they seemed to get good use out of what they had.  The actors give a good enjoyable performance without going over the top and the writing doesn't make you want to roll your eyes. I never played the games myself but I know enough of the basics that they managed to stay pretty loyal to it.  Probably one of the best video game based films ever made....for whatever that is worth.

The only thing i could imagine people would be upset with is that this seems to lack that gritty fatalistic despair that people seem to think you need to have in these sorts of films.  I mean there are some good sad parts in there, Virginia Madsen's character is rather well written in that regard.  However the overall film doesn't seem to weighed down by it.

I'll probably end up buying this down the line to keep in my library for rainy days and when the announced sequel comes out I'll probably give it a watch as well.

I'd say this is a film to watch if your staying in for the night but there is nothing on TV....don't think you'd feel cheated.",1445472000,,1167,4.292237442922374

7167747,2,B00XHZQAAY,"Bought this locally. I should have it on the shelf. I don't know anything about the game and there is nothing in this movie that inspires me to find out about it. I have no complaints about the acting and this review should not reflect upon the actors--they did what they could with what they were given. SPOILER ALERT: The plot is weak at best (yes, even a zombie movie needs a plot in my book). There have been zombie outbreaks before. A daily injection keeps those bitten normal although shunned by society. A new outbreak occurs. People go to a stadium for evacuation. Ala Katrina, there is no food or water, and no buses for evacuation. There are doctors on hand to give the infected their daily doses of Zombex but the medications don't work and soon zombies are running amok. FEZA (FEMA for zombie outbreaks) is trying to contain the situation. They suspect the zombie virus is now airborne, so, no one is allowed to leave. Police shoot innocent people who refuse to turn back from the barricades. A reporter gets out just as the barricades are ordered to close. She is confined in a FEZA tent but the cops who have been in contact with her are left to walk around -great containment. The Army arrives to save the day. They are going to firebomb the city. The General does not want to but FEZA is in charge, not him. Once our intrepid reporter is rescued she helps the General sway opinions to give him control. He is supposed to rescue her fellow journalist and an infected woman who have proof that the drugs given at the arena were from a bad batch. Long story short, the makers of Zombex have a chip that can suppress the virus for a year but comes with the price that they can monitor anyone with it 24/7. The whole thing is a conspiracy by the manufacturer and the US Army to gain approval for the chip. The head of FEZA and the intrepid reporter become a problem and are 'disappeared' by the Army. The conspiracy works. Moving on. There are bad bikers who want the apocalypse so they can run wild and plan to blow the containment so the zombies will spread. Yes they get it in the end. Weapons are a problem for our heroes. In a country with firearms everywhere, all they can find is a single revolver with no bullets?  This leads to them ""making"" weapons that were just outright silly--who duct tapes a perfectly good sword to a shovel? Then there was the wielding-two-chainsaws-simultaneously scene. Lots of action with over-the-top gore that was neither frightening nor amusing. I found much of the movie boring and came close to nodding off a couple of times. I only gave this film two stars as the heroes' fight with the zombie cop and clown was amusing. Also the movie kept going back to a news program in which the anchor is interviewing their zombie expert who is the survivor of a previous zombie outbreak and an author. Their banter was amusing and the only thing that made the movie worth watching.",1445126400,2,2923,4.4943609022556394

Tons of zombies, vicious thugs, and LOTS of duct-taped weapons! Honestly, some of those weapons were so ridiculous. In the game, they work great, but in real life,..I'm not sure duct taping a shovel to the end of a sword is THE best course of action?! But I digress,...

Chase rushes off to get the story and when Tracy can't locate him she hurries off to make her way out.

I don't want to ruin it any further as it is fairly entertaining! It wouldn't have been nearly as good has Rob Riggle not done such awesome job as Frank West! Man, he had some really funny lines!

Final Verdict: If you like the game,..watch it!",1442448000,6,1330,4.487603305785124

8715903,3,B00XHZQAAY,"Ive never heard of the video game, I just happen to like zombie flicks.  On that basis, the story begins with that tired old cheat, throwing the viewer into the middle of some action only to have it halted abruptly fora few days earlier.  Back in time, a reporter of sorts (Jesse Metcalfe as Chase Carter), obnoxiously thrusts himself into what he hopes will be a good story.  As it turns out, it is a good story, if he survives to tell it.  What follows is a vague conspiracy that isn't much of an attention grabber.  The government, by way of the army, want a zombie outbreak for the sole purpose of injecting tracking chips into the infected.  Why?  Why not.  And who cares.  I don't watch zombie flicks for crazy conspiracy theories, I watch for the zombie carnage.  There is no other reason to make a movie featuring zombies.  Theyre not there to recite Shakespeare.

I will say I liked the clown zombie.  And for the most part, the zombie action was well played.  But.  The plot was stalemilitary coverups have been done before and better.  It didn't help that the main villain (Dennis Haysbert as General Lyons) was bland, with a boring monotone and no expression.  The so-called military menace was done offscreen and the general slept through most of it.",1516665600,,1263,4.591928251121076

It is a bit gamey, but I personally thought it was good, in fact some of it was funny as a result.",1512604800,,274,3.789473684210526
8715906,3,B00XHZQAAY,I like the Dead Rising games but this is lot better then the latest live action Resident Evil movies. Because there is more stuff that came from the games that was put into this movie. It's watchable but not the greatest game or zombie based movie.,1502582400,,248,4.413043478260869
