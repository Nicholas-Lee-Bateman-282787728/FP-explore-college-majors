7943244,3,B00005KHJK,"Rob Lowe did great in the film and it has some similarity of the Fugitive when Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison chasing an escaped convict prisoner. But this movie is different and a little less budget film. However, it shows several climaxes and actions with guns, explosions. An action movie goers would enjoy this film.",1179705600,,318,4.8
7943245,3,B00005KHJK,"PROXIMITY is almost a good movie, and even as it is, it kept me interested.  But be warned:  Rob Lowe is rather wooden as the lead, and he does some incredibly stupid things; the villains (all cops) also do incredibly stupid things.  However, amidst all this stupidity, are some tight action scenes and some good suspense.  The movie posits the question of justice for the victims' families.  James Coburn plays an outwardly saintly man who offers resolution to the families of murder/manslaughter victims, which of course includes Lowe, who was responsible for the death of one of his students in a car accident in which he was drunk.  Aside from ruining his marriage, it's also placed him in jail with more detestable killers, including David Flynn as a killer with no remorse or conscience, and who shamelessly chews up the scenery.  Coburn's method of instilling justice is to have Flynn kill prisoners in the same prison housing Lowe.  What's even worse is that the victims' families are paying large sums of money for Coburn to have this done.  When Lowe finds out what's going on, Coburn marks him for death, but an ill-conceived attempt results in a van crash and Lowe getting freed to try and expose the culprits.  The psychotic henchmen (Jonathan Banks, TC Carson) and the prison warden (Joe Santos) botch several attempts to catch Lowe, and Lowe uses a newspaper reporter (Scott Plate) to expose Coburn.  A lot that goes on is ludicrous, but for a B movie thriller, director Scott Ziehl keeps the story moving and as a reviewer says, Cleveland has never looked lovelier.  You could do worse.",1116374400,2,1602,4.827838827838828
7943246,3,B00005KHJK,"Okay, I'll be honest here.  I bought this movie mostly because Rob Lowe is in it.  Yet the plot is strange and it's rather disturbing to watch.  They kept going from scene to scene rather quickly in my opinion, not allowing the plots to fully unfold.",1061510400,,250,4.391304347826087
7943247,1,B00005KHJK,"...I am a huge movie fan and I will always give a movie a chance, but this movie never even had a chance!!! ...There are so many parts of this movie that were not well thought out at all ...I dare you to see this movie!!!...",1046131200,2,224,3.891304347826087
7943248,1,B00005KHJK,This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I take that back.  It definitely is the worst movie I've ever seen.  The good news is that I didn't pay a cent to see it.  The whole movie was comprised of really bad acting.  Rob Lowe must be hurting for money.  The plot was beyond ridiculous.  I feel sorry for anyone who was in this movie or had anything to do with it.  It really stunk up the place.,1019779200,7,403,4.012658227848101
7943249,2,B00005KHJK,"If you want to rent this video, don't waste your money. The story is so similar to the Fugitive that you might as well get that one instead. Lowe plays a teacher who is in prison on a vehicular homicide charge who begins to suspect a conspiracy to kill off prisoners. After a bus accident, he escapes and tries to figure out how to save his life with corrupt guards chasing after him. I only wanted to see it because it was filmed in Cleveland and it was weird seeing familiar streets on my TV. I have never been a big Rob Lowe fan-I always thought of him as a slick pretty boy-but he actually ACTED in this movie. James Coburn, one of my favorite actors, was wasted in his role of a victims advocate. All in all, the dialogue was terrible, the direction choppy and the storyline has been done to death.",1001808000,4,803,4.254901960784314
