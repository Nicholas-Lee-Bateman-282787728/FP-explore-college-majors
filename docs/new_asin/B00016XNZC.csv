1975367,4,B00016XNZC,"The Man Who Changed His Mind was a four star movie for all fans of Boris Karloff.  This film, made in Britain, might have been one of the Universal Mad Scientist series and was a really fine production. The premise was the ability to transfer the memories, thoughts, and the conscious mind from one human to another electrically, no surgery or brain transplant required!  Interesting and very entertaining.

The video transfer quality and an original fine print added up to a very good screen quality DVD.",1240704000,2,505,4.848837209302325
1975368,4,B00016XNZC,This 1 hour gem stars Boris Karloff as a mad scientist switching brains/thoughts of humans to accomplish his goals. He goes mad mainly due to him agreeing to run his experiments at a University that doesn't accept his ideas and everyone laughs at him. They threaten to shut him down and take all his work. There is a lot of suspense when he switches with his ex assistants boyfriend and has to save him. The acting and love interest is pretty good for its time. Really a great entertaining movie and its only 65 minutes long. Karloff is GREAT as usual. I highly recommend this to Karloff fans and classic horror and science fiction fans. I think this has been an overlooked movie that deserves more recognition.,1234915200,2,711,4.606299212598425
1975369,5,B00016XNZC,"AKA ""The Man Who Lived Again."" Well done Brit-made thriller, with a very subtle touch of humor, typical of the Brits.  This is sometimes grouped with the Karloff ""mad doctor"" flicks from Columbia, but this was released earlier--in 1936, the year after ""The Bride of Frankenstein,"" and Karloff doesn't hold back.  His Dr. Laurience is clearly nuts and loves it.  Great support from Frank Cellier as the Rupert Murdoch-type publisher whose betrayal pushes Karloff over the edge.  I won't spoil the plot, but see how long it takes you to figure out why Dr. Laurience is a chain smoker.  This DVD has no extras, but is worth the purchase.  Essential for Karloff fans.",1173484800,2,663,4.823008849557522
1975370,2,B00016XNZC,"Vintage Karloff, but not as memorable as some of the others. The chimp has some of the best lines. This will be of interest mainly to those who admired Boris for his ability to play these parts so well.",1142035200,3,202,4.205128205128205
1975371,5,B00016XNZC,"Rarely seen in America until its video release, ""The Man Who Changed His Mind"" (1936) is a Boris Karloff classic worth seeking out. Directed by a pre-Disney Robert Stevenson, this British production showcases one of Karloff's finest performances as a vengeful scientist. Chilling and unforgettable - infinitely superior to most Karloff vehicles from the late 1930s.",1131753600,9,365,5.535714285714286
1975372,5,B00016XNZC,"Simply put, this film is a wonderful way to spend 66 minutes.  For those who cherish classic cinema, this is a must.  Quality print, excellent sound, and a story that efficiently moves along makes this feature a treat.  Karloff the Great does it again!!",1131580800,11,253,4.704545454545454
1975373,5,B00016XNZC,"In the English production The Man Who Changed His Mind (1936) aka The Brainsnatcher aka Doctor Maniac Who Lived Again aka Dr. Maniac aka The Man Who Lived Again (whew!), directed by Robert Stevenson, who later went on to direct primarily for Disney on such features as Old Yeller (1957), The Absent Minded Professor (1961), Mary Poppins (1964), The Love Bug (1968) among many others, stars Boris Karloff as Dr. Laurience, a scientist who has perfected a means to remove the content of one's mind, store it, and transfer it to another host body.  The film also stars Anna Lee, whose film and television credits, spanning 65 years, are too numerous to mention here, as Dr. Clare Wyatt along with John Loder, another actor with an extensive history in film, as Dick Haslewood.
The film begins with a young couple, Dr. Clare Wyatt and Dick Haslewood, discussing Clare's imminent departure to go and work with the well known, but now reclusive, brain specialist Dr. Laurience.  It's a great opportunity for Clare, but Dick feels uneasy about it, and uses the chance to badger Clare with his endless proposals of marriage, which contain all the charm of asking one what'd they like for lunch.  He's a real smooth one, that Dick...oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention Dick is a news reporter, and the newspaper he writes for is also owned by his father, Lord Haslewood (I don't think Lord is his name but more like his title, as the English are apt to lavish such things on you if you got the dough).  A classic case of nepotism?  Sure looks that way to me...anyhow, Dick decides to follow (can you say stalker?) Clare out to the small village where Dr. Laurience is holed up on the pretense that maybe there's a story to be had, but we all know he's jonsin' for the Clare.  Clare arrives at a dilapidated old house, where she meets Dr. Laurience, along with his cranky, gimpy, wheelchair-confined psuedo manservant Clayton.  Clayton seems to suffer from any number of normally fatal maladies, but the doctor manages to keep him alive.  Why?  It couldn't be for the man's wit and personality, as he's a real crank and quite curmudgeonly.  We soon learn of what the doctor has been doing, his whole saving the contents of the mind deal.  At first the notion, while intriguing, doesn't seem to be very practical, but then we see the real application as Dr. Laurience transfers the minds of two chimpanzees (you see, one monkey was docile while the other hostile, and, after strapping electrified colanders to their heads, the once docile monkey was now hostile, and vice versa).  Isn't science a wonderful thing?  Anyway, after the success, the doctor now ponders another experiment, one with human subjects...
Dick, who isn't aware of any of this, writes a fluff piece to which his father, Lord Haslewood, a pompous goof and supposedly supporter of science, offers Dr. Lauirence an opportunity to work in his institute, and access to much better equipment and resources on the condition that Haslewood's newspaper gets exclusive rights to publish the results of the doctor's experiments, whatever they may concern.  The trouble really begins after Lord Haslewood calls together the scientific community so that Dr. Lauirence may announce his theories, which elicits much derision, and subsequently Lord Haslewood not only cuts off the doctor's funding, but then he claims all the work Dr. Lauirence has done is now his property, to do with as he wishes, based on the contracts signed.  This sends Dr. Lauirence over the edge, in a particularly great scene, and the mad scientist now becomes an evil mad scientist, declaring his intentions to use his machines and theories not for the betterment of mankind as he once hoped, but for his own, personal gain.  Just what exactly does this entail?  Well, you'll have to watch and see...
I really enjoyed this little known creepy classic.  Karloff plays the mad scientist wonderfully, managing to squeeze out a certain amount of pathos and dimension in a role others would have played in more traditional, straight up form.  Purely interested in the science of screwing around in realms not meant to be delved into my man, he soon finds himself betrayed by those who once seemed to support him, and now he reverts to the very callous base human attributes of greed, lust, and revenge.  The supporting actors, all accomplished within their own right, were wonderful and seemed to flourish within the context of good scripting, snappy and polished dialogue, and excellent direction.  I did love Karloff's mind snatching machine...it was kind of subdued, certainly not in the grand nature of that of Frankenstein, but certainly believable and adequate, despite the fantastical theories and possibilities behind it...the morality of Dr. Lauirence's experiments within the story were rarely focused upon, but it did seem to be an underlying aspect imbedded in the story, allowing for the viewer to come to his/her own conclusions, which I appreciated.  The film, which runs approximately 66 minutes, moves quickly, wasting little or no time on useless elements.  I did sort of question Clayton's relationship with the doctor, as he didn't seem capable of much anything given his state, and his presence seemed a bit contrived as the plot unfolded, but this was a minor issue.  I really loved the bits of humor injected within the script, which worked wonderfully to round out some of the characters.
The full screen (original aspect ratio) print provided on this disc looks remarkably good, despite its' age, and the audio is clear and crisp, much better than I would have expected, given the rarity (until now) of the film.  There are no special features available other than chapter stops, but that matter little to me given the excellent quality of the film available here.

8007420,4,B00016XNZC,"The acting is very good as is the picture and sound. The plot is a good one, but like all B movies of this time frame it is to short. Almost every good B movie I have seen could have been a very good A movie if the movie makers would have added only another 10 to 20 minutes keeping the same plot going. On their part I think it was just greed. What they forgot was how much more money would have been made had they listed the movie as an A movie. Yes they paid the actors less, but in the end the joke is on them. This process would never work on todays so called B movies because they almost never have a good plot, just a lot of action and even that is most often bad.",1412208000,,671,3.8

8007422,5,B00016XNZC,"The Man Who Changed His Mind is a magnificent early science-fiction movie featuring Boris Karloff as Dr. Laurience, a scientist who is obsessed with the idea to defeat the process of aging and dying by developing a scientific method to transfer the content of the mind to a different body. After successfully performing his procedure on primates, he is determined to take the next step and apply it to humans. The experiment leads to the desired results and Laurience's disabled assistant Clayton receives the healthy body of Laurience's prior sponsor Lord Hazelwood. Soon it is Laurience's own turn to exchange his mind with Hazelwood's son.

The pre-dominant theme of the mad scientist striving for immortality / rejuvenation takes up the Frankenstein-motif and relates the overall goal of the protagonist to hubris in a similar manner. The movie's increasing suspense results from the growing obsession of Dr. Laurience, especially with his intentions eventually leading him to murder and abuse which soon cause investigators to take up his trace. Finally, the movie reaches a dramatic peak ending in a catastrophe. Except for the underlying death-approving morality which leaves a slightly bitter taste, the movie makes for most exciting entertainment.",1327881600,,1256,5.375634517766497
8007423,5,B00016XNZC,"Boris Karloff!  Mind transplants! Headstrong female scientists! 30s sci-fi horror! A watchable yet seldom seen film! What's not to like?

The Man Who Changed His Mind (1936) is the second Robert Stevenson (later of Disney fame), Anna Lee, and John Loder feature I've seen -- the first, Non-Stop New York (1937) wasn't nearly as good -- I'll chalk that up to the absence of Boris Karloff!

Brief Plot Summary (limited spoilers)

A young brain surgeon Clare Wyatt (a feisty Anna Lee) sets off to work with the once respectable scientist Dr. Laurience (Boris Karloff).  Her journalist love interest Dick (John Loder) attempts to follower her but is strongly rebuffed.  The typical gender roles have been switched -- the headstrong woman is usually the journalist and the male love interest usually the scientist. Dr. Laurience lives in a crumbling manor with his chimpanzees and a wheelchair bound patient/assistant Clayton (Donald Calthrop).  Clayton is suspicious of female scientists and women in general (""all hysterics and can't keep a secret"") however Dr. Laurience picked her because she is brilliant in her field.

Dr. Laurience has achieved a scientific breakthrough -- he's able to extract the thought content of the brain and ""store it as one stores electricity.""  In a visually interesting sequence, Dr. Laurience removes the brain of a chimpanzee with a large mechanical contraption (queue electricity currents!) and stores it in a container.  In order to prove his theory he decides to transfer the chimpanzee's stored thought content into another animal.

Of course, the doctor eventually wants to switch human brains!  Human immortality!

Meanwhile, Dick's journalistic endeavors in regards to uncovering the true nature of the manor have brought him to the attention of his father, the Lord Haslewood who offers Dr. Laurience a top-quality laboratory to continue his work. Problems crop up when Dr. Laurience is scoffed at by the scientific community and is fired from the institute by Haslewood who feels humiliated.  The sinister Doctor suffers a breakdown and invites Lord Haslewood to the laboratory and... well... watch and find out!

Final Thoughts

This is vintage Boris Karloff in a seldom seen gem!  He's scary and he can act-for example, the mental breakdown sequence is top-notch as is his relatively stable beginning persona and of course the crazy man second half.

The Man Who Changed His Mind is fast-paced unadulterated British sci-fi horror fun.  The film never drags, in part because of Anna Lee's exuberance, and somewhat surprisingly, portrays female scientists in a mostly positive light.  The cinematography is competent and on occasion above average (for example, Dr. Laurience's lecture sequence to scientific community).

A must see for fans of 1930s sci-fi horror, the crazy rantings and ravings of Boris Karloff, and cinephiles in general....",1307404800,,2883,5.292307692307692
8007424,5,B00016XNZC,"Nice indeed! This is an excellent science fiction movie from 1936 starring Boris Karloff and Anna Lee. Boris is almost humane as the experimental neurologists who goes over the edge when his peers laugh him off the podium during a presentation. I know how he feels! His fabulous discovery is the ability to transfer the ""soul"" of a person, their thoughts and personality, to another body. He is working in a shabby house with his catty, wheelchair bound critic (lover?) whose primary purpose is to throw cold water all over the professor's bigger ideas including the notion of getting a woman in  the place to cook and clean! The prof had apparently been tossed out of his last gig in Zurich but not before he found his muse, a lovely young lady doctor (yes! how I enjoyed seeing a strong smart woman on the screen). He calls to her, she can't refuse. The catty wheelchair boyfriend bristles, the rich newspaper reporter boyfriend pursues, rich dad comes on in and the whole thing is set in motion. Rich dad sets up the professor in his Institute and expects him to produce! Such pressure! The talk goes bad, and personalities start flying in and out of bodies but in the end the girl scientist sets is all right. The monkeys make an effective cameo, and all this plays out in about an hour.

I totally loved this movie. It played like a house on fire. There were unexpected twists and turns to the plot both devious and unexpected. Speaking of fire, Mr Karloff smokes through the whole movie, lighting his cigarette on the bunsen burner in a gesture so graceful and nonchalant I wanted to take up smoking just to do that very thing. The production values were surprisingly good as was the acting. The print and the sound were great. I totally recommend it.",1304294400,,1757,4.610223642172524
8007425,4,B00016XNZC,"""The Man Who Changed His Mind"" is a UK production with Boris Karloff as the mad scientist.

At the start we have a female scientist (Anna Lee, plays it cute!) who gets razzed for not being married to the son of a newspaper magnate and who ever heard of a female scientist anyway *wink *wink.  But she shows them -- she goes to work for Boris (Dr. Laurience)!

Karloff's character picks her as an assistant to his experiments on brain theory.  The others in the community consider him a bit of a fraud.  But he successfully transfers the mind of two chimps.  Things are looking up.

They are, until the newspaper magnate, Lord Haselwood (a pompous dork who we have no mercy nor sympathy) takes over the slightly mad scientist, gives him a new lab and takes Karloff's character's wheelchaired friend along for laughs.

The big announcement of the ""Brain Genius"" having a great lecture sponsored by the newspaper is made.  And is it!  From kites flying celebrating the event to posters splashed all over England.  Brain genius!  And he gets laughed out of the auditorium.

This I don't get -- why not show his lab results and have the woman scientist be a witness to his success rather than laughing him out of the lab!

To make a long story short, we have Boris deciding to change a few minds of his own and use his technique for the good of himself!  Death ensues and only the woman can save the day!  Nice lesson.

The film does several things here:  the criticism of the English news media, the pompous arrogance of the media industry and pushing the envelope of women's' rights in the field of science.  The film ends with some chatter of the sanctity of the human mind.  OK, fine.  Karloff's smooth dramatic style, his intensity of belief in his theories, and his convincing slide into madness.

Karloff plays his role in a sinister manner, seriously and, bless him, does not laugh during the most cheesiest of moments.  Not a bad film for the completist, but there are better Karloff mad scientist films.  Alternate title:  ""The Man Who Lived Again"".

The DVD is not great!  Scene selections and that's about it.  The quality is OK, but not up to the level of clear black & white as enjoyed with Columbia films.

8007426,5,B00016XNZC,"Boris Karloff was one of the breed of distinguished actors who always gave a fine performance regardless of the material handed him. THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND is an example of performance and content being of high calibre, and it's a film that is, for the most part, unjustly overlooked.

Produced by the British Gaumont Studios in 1936, THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND is about a mad scientist ( Karloff ) who discovers a method of transfering minds from one person to another. When the scientific community ridicules his claims, he decides to use his invention for his own evil intentions.

At a compact running time of 65 minutes, this film manages to pack into its plot more twists and turns than many others twice that length, and yet none of it ever feels like it was shoehorned to fit. Well directed and atmospherically photographed, THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND ranks right up there with the classic Universal horror films from the same period. Karloff is a delight, pulling out all the stops in what has to be one of his most diabolical portrayals. It's also interesting to see pretty Lila Lee playing opposite Karloff here, since they were to star together again ten years later in Val Lewton's BEDLAM.

The picture and sound quality of this DVD is pristine; reminiscent of the fine disc of Karloff's other British horror classic, THE GHOUL ( 1933 ). If you saw that film, you know what I mean when I say THE MAN WHO CHANGED HIS MIND  is every bit as good. Don't pass this one up.",1298851200,,1490,4.548507462686567

Converting the mind into electricity, he can transfer it from one body to another. So far, he has only conducted experiments on apes, but rising pressures force him into trying his technique on a human being. Can Wyatt detect the Doctor's sinister plan and stop him before it's too late? The Man who Changed His Mind is a forward-thinking film for its portrayal of the soul as an entity that can be understood and manipulated scientifically, as well as for casting a woman in the role of the protagonist doctor. An often overlooked gem.",1290902400,,768,4.825757575757576
