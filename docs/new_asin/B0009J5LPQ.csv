2293797,3,B0009J5LPQ,"I chose this film simply because It looked like a good adventurous western with Glenn Ford, but I was in for a surpise when I discovered it was a low key story about a really good guy who is too good for is own good. Ford delivers a very believable performance as a very unusual humaitarian, but I was a little disappointed with his character's reaction to some of the situations he was faced with.",1353715200,,398,4.32
2293798,5,B0009J5LPQ,"STORY: Glenn Ford stars as the rancher Smith, who is driving his family to frustration with his gentle procrastinating ways that have kept the farm from doing well. The hay needs to be cut, and he is distracted with his ongoing friendships with a local Nez Perce Native American tribe. When a tribal member is wrongly accused of murder, Smith comes to his defense. As a sign of the tribe's gratitude, they help train a horse from the ranch, and they help get the hay crop in on time.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Live action Disney classic. Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson, and Chief Dan George also star in this movie, and a good song written by Bobby Russell for the movie is featured, ""The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy"". While production was started initially by James Algar, Bill Anderson took over as producer fairly early. One of the studios greatest producers, Anderson saw the fim as a chance to appeal to a more mature audience that a typical Disney film, vital to Disney's growth. Directed by Michael O'Herlihy. The story had been adapted by studio staff storyman Louis Pelletier from a book by Paul St. Pierre titled, ""Breaking Smith's Quarter Horse"". This movie was released to theaters on March 21, 1969, and was released on video in 1987. It never featured on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show. It is 102 minutes in length.

Released almost two years after Walt's death, this film was almost unseen by the public since a top studio executive hated the film based on only a few scenes. He cut all funding for promotion of the film so there was no audience waiting to see it. Even a good review in the LA Times did not help bring the viewers in and it was out of theaters before the word of mouth could send in the crowds. I recommend this hidden little film from the Disney vault.",1295827200,4,1799,4.56656346749226
2293799,4,B0009J5LPQ,"Glenn Ford shines in this almost unknown Disney film.  He plays Ed Smith, a small-scale rancher in 1960's Idaho known to one and all (including his wife Norah (Nancy Olson of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Absent-Minded-Professor-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00009Y3RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Absent-Minded Professor (Widescreen Edition)</a>) and 11-year-old son Albie (Christopher Shea)) as simply ""Smith.""  He enjoys an excellent relationship with the local Nez Perce Indians, of whom Ol' Antoine (Chief Dan George), a centenarian-plus who was with Chief Joseph on his famous march in 1877, is perhaps his best friend, as young Peterpaul (Ricky Cordell) is his son's.  When one of the younger men of the tribe, Gabriel Jimmyboy (Frank Ramirez), is accused of murder, his first choice of a hideout is Smith's land.  This brings Smith into conflict with a bigoted deputy (Keenan Wynn) who's solidly convinced of Jimmyboy's guilt and resolved to bring him in dead or alive.  And when Jimmyboy is finally sent to the county seat for trial, Smith's dislike of the official interpreter, a halfbreed named Walter Charlie (Warren Oates), leads him to leave his ranch in the lurch with the hay ready to be cut and the bank hovering like a vulture in order to serve as Antoine's voice in court and (he hopes) prove Jimmyboy's innocence.

At first look this movie is oddly unsatisfying; Antoine's testimony seems to have nothing at all to do with the case under consideration, and we never do find out who committed the murder.  But when you stand off and think about it, you realize that the story isn't about a murder or its trial; it's about a man's ethics, his sense of obligation to his friends, and theirs to him.  George, who burst upon the consciousness of the moviegoing public the following year when he played Old Lodge Skins in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Big-Man/dp/B00003CXB5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Big Man</a>, is completely convincing as a survival from a day gone by, Jay Silverheels (best known as Tonto in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lone-Ranger-75th-Anniversary-Seasons-1-and-2/dp/B001DJ7Q0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lone Ranger: 75th Anniversary - Seasons 1 and 2</a>) does a fine turn as McDonald Lashaway, Roger Ewing (who was briefly the male ingenue character Clayton Thaddeus Greenwood in the early 60-minute episodes of ""Gunsmoke"") appears as Jimmyboy's bemused and overwhelmed young public-defense attorney, and Eric Clavering plays the thoroughly original Young Alexander, who's almost as old as Antoine but still zooms around on an ancient sidecar motorcycle.  There's also a real sense of the Nez Perce character and idiom and an uplifting conclusion.  This is a family movie that should spark discussion and offend no one.",1263427200,8,2916,5.937947494033413

2293801,5,B0009J5LPQ,"Eddie Murphy's (48 Hrs,. Trading Places) superstar-making role has him playing crafty Detroit cop Axel Foley, who travels to Beverly Hills in order to try to uncover the reasons behind the professional hit placed on an old friend (Russo, The Postman).  His investigative tactics immediately draw the attention of the local law enforcement there, who put a tail on Foley to make sure that his story of being on vacation there holds up.

By-the-book detectives Taggart (Ashton, Midnight Run) and Rosewood (Reinhold, Roadhouse 66) are the cops assigned to staking out Foley, and Axel ends up dragging them both into the investigation through his charm, which ends up getting them into more and more hot water with the boss, Lt. Bogomil (Cox, RoboCop).  With the cops on his case, his boss back in Detroit threatening his livelihood, and armed henchmen at every turn, Foley has a hard time trying to maintain focus on his intended prey, the wealthy art dealer, Victor Maitland (Berkoff, Octopussy).

One of the most purely-entertaining action-comedies of its era, Beverly Hills Cop featured a dead-perfect mix of action and comedy, delivering a maximum amount of laughs and thrills in equal measure.  The casting is perfect all around, and actor's director Martin Brest (Going in Style, Meet Joe Black) kept the tempo loose and fun both in front of and behind the camera, and the camaraderie felt among the performers definitely shows on screen.  Eddie Murphy proves to be a revelation, bringing a fantastic improvisational style, a blend of street-smarts and core intelligence, and a good physical presence that makes for a perfect hero worth watching and listening to every word uttered just to see what he'll say or do next.

Bolstered by a killer soundtrack (""The Heat is On"", ""Neutron Dance"", and ""New Attitude' proved to be huge hits) and one of the best of the synthy 1980s scores by Harold Faltermeyer (many mainstream 80s scores are hard on the ears today, but not this one), Beverly Hills Cop gives you everything you could want in an action-comedy -- great stunts, fun characters, inventive situations, and an infectious energy.  It's also one of the few examples of comedic action flicks where the laughs don't end once the mayhem at the film's climax begins.  It would go on to become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, only eclipsed 20 years later by The Matrix Reloaded (The Passion of the Christ beat that just one year later).

Looking at Beverly Hills Cop in hindsight, it's hard to believe that Eddie Murphy had been plugged in just two weeks before production began (replacing Sly Stallone).  This is a perfect vehicle for Murphy, with the perfect kind of director in Brest to allow him to do his thing in a funny way, while also keeping him focused on always pushing the story forward.  It would set the trend for all future projects to cater to Murphy's enormous appeal, while also changing the landscape of the action movies of the 1980s into injecting more comedy and music than had been the norm in the hardboiled 1970s.  Though often imitated, Beverly Hills Cop was never quite replicated, even by its inevitable sequels.",1243382400,,3155,4.919020715630885

I found it dull and uninspiring. Some of the indians (includng Jay Silverheels, Tonto from the Lone Ranger) were true indians and therefore believable. Some ""indians"" were whites (Warren Oates) with either French or Italian accents as they attempted the native tongue. Chief Joseph's speech by ""Ol' Antoine"", played by Chief Dan George, was very moving. Overall, though, it was a waste of money.",1373068800,,573,4.74
