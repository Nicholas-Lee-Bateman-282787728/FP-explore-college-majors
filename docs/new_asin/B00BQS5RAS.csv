8572815,5,B00BQS5RAS,"This DVD/CD set was made by a woman in Montana who manages a farm, has 7 children, home schools 5 of them (the other two are babies), keeps up a house and keeps a meal plan.

Man, I'm a slacker.

The DVD video is made of her going over what helps her stay organized. The CD is filled with a large number of forms that she uses to help keep her house and home school running efficiently.

The 20some odd dollars may seem a bit steep, but it isn't considering the work she put into this. I am very happy with my purchase. I will be looking for anything else she has put out.",1370304000,2,572,4.0
