5834434,2,B00DN3U72W,"Dolph Lundgren leads an impressive (for this type of low budget film) cast that also includes Billy Zane, Robert Miano, Vinnie Jones and Robert Davi. It's nice to see all of them in the same movie, but ""Blood of Redemption"" doesn't have much else going for it. The story is rather convoluted and never really caught my interest. Although Lundgren's character, Axel, is the narrator and main protagonist, there's a lot of focus on the other characters so we never really get to know him. At times, the filmmakers seemed to try to go for a neo-noir feeling, with mixed results.

Not really recommended, unless you feel you need to watch it to see the actors.",1382572800,,656,4.655172413793103
5834435,5,B00DN3U72W,"I actually really enjoyed this film, its got a plot and an ending that you would not expect, the characters are interesting, and it is pact full of names, Dolph Lungren, Billy Zane, Vinnie Jones, Robert Davi, etc. I was actually surprised when I was watching the movie, not expecting all of the recognizable names. If you are a fan of Dolph, Billy or Vinnie, you got to see this! PS, some nice looking ladies as well",1379894400,6,416,4.415584415584416
5834436,2,B00DN3U72W,"""This is the story of a dead man."" Quinn Forte (Zane) is on top of the world. He has everything anyone could want but he also has enemies. One night he is betrayed  by someone close to him and winds up in jail. When he gets out he wants to find out who was behind it and hires The Swede (Lundgren) to help him do it. Little by little The Swede begins to unravel the mystery but that only leaves more questions. Once again I have to start by saying that this is a movie that you will either watch or not regardless of a review. Dolph Lundgren has a specific following. This is really just a typical Lundgren movie full of mindless action and dialog trying to cover up a overdused plot. It may sound like I'm unnecessarily harsh on this movie but it wasn't as bad as most of his movies. I do also have to say that Lundgren knows his limits and sticks to them for better or worse. The last twenty minutes, though very predictable, was not bad and if you make it to the end you will enjoy that part. Nothing really to rush out and see though. Overall, a typical Lundgren movie, if you like him you will like this one. I give it a C.",1379289600,5,1128,4.081081081081081
5834437,3,B00DN3U72W,"Axel (Dolph Lundgren) is the body guard for crime boss Sergio (Robert Miano) and his family. Sergio and Hayden (Robert Davi) are partners. They have Senator Roswald (Jim Storm) in their pocket. They are involved in identity theft and gambling, recently branching out into counterfeiting. They deal with Boris (Massi Furlan) a Russian and the Chinese (Scott Ly). Campbell (Vinnie Jones) is Hayden's English nephew who comes over to supply the film with an actor I like. Sergio has two sons, Quinn (Billy Zane) and Kurt (Gianni Capaldi). Loryn (Jelly Howie) seems to be everybody's girlfriend. I think I got it right.

Sergio gets the word from the senator he must end his activities as he can no longer protect him. Also 30 minutes into this feature we find out Kurt works for the FBI. When Sergio gets killed, this becomes a very bad and confusing who-dun-it, with Axel wanting to find his former boss's killer using a picture board and red lines.

This is a good guy vs. bad guy vs. bad guy vs bad guy vs bad guy film. (There's actually a couple of more bad guy factions to this as everyone is on their own side, but I think you get the point.) The scenes were interesting and well done while the over all plot has holes and was immaterial.

Please note that the FBI does back ground checks. They don't hire people with crime connections and certainly wouldn't allow them to work on their own family's case. Nor does the FBI have just paper file folders on people. They do have a computer.

Okay as a rental for fans of Billy Zane.

5834440,3,B00DN3U72W,"This was an ok movie.  I can't stand movies where there's so much back-stabbing, you forget how the movie started.  This is one of those.  Set in today's world, it features several rival families who blame each other for one of the patriarchs death.  No one knows who really kills him until the very end, when things become very clear all of a sudden.
Dolph Lundgren plays a body guard and trusted confidant to the family of the patriarch who's killed.  He tries the entire movie to figure out who did it, and discovers, to his disappointment, the perpetrator who he had trusted for years, and eventually was shot by.  But, no worries, he rights things with his old friend and new enemy, and comes out clean in the end.  I think the ending was the best part.  But, you might disagree.  Check it out...you might be more clever in figuring out who the bad guy is.",1410480000,,861,4.43312101910828
5834441,3,B00DN3U72W,"First thing you need to know is that this is a ""B"" movie. The second thing that most people know already is that you do NOT go to Dolph Lundgren movies for the quality of the acting. So now that the formalities are out of the way, Dolph makes action films and I have bias towards action movies. The storyline for this project is better than most and has a few twist and turns. The acting is far from Academy Award status but this is better than expected from this crew: Vinnie Jones, Billy Zane, Gianni Capaldi, and Robert Davi. Now about the action there is hand to hand and gun fighting. In all honesty the hand to hand could have been much better. The gun fighting was alright, but surprising as this may sound: the storyline saves this film.",1409011200,,745,4.328571428571428

5834443,4,B00DN3U72W,"Wow!  A Dolph Lundgren action flick with a decent plot.  He joins a former criminal (Billy Zane) who just gets out of jail to go after the people who were behind the betrayal of his former boss.  It doesn't matter that he is being used, Lundgren's character is more intelligent than his usual roles, he is just interested in taking down the people responsible.  Good twists and a strong supporting cast keep the film interesting.  Not a great film, but entertaining and better than his usual fare.",1400803200,,497,4.666666666666667
5834444,3,B00DN3U72W,"While it prominently shows Dolph Lundgren on the cover, this is not so much about his story as it is about a man that is out for revenge and uses Lundren's character to get it. He does narrate it and if you get beyond the fact he is not a major character, it's okay to pass the time",1397260800,,282,3.8793103448275863

5834446,2,B00DN3U72W,"Very poor, badly directed, such a huge lack of any character's development! Yes, it is not the Asylum, that is for sure, but, it is like a wanna be mainstream action flick that cannot just make it to be either thrilling nor convincing. A slick look is not enough, the need of better scripts and directors is a main problem here, and it dooms the whole thing making me regret the expense! Stay away!
