8637544,5,B00HZMZ290,"I moved away from Saint Louis---to Europe---in 1994. I was not familiar with three of these TV series.
Since buying this ""teaser-compilation"", I bought the one-season run of ""ACTION""; ""NED & STACY:
Season 1""; and the three available seasons of ""Just Shoot Me!""

Since you are more familiar with these programs than I am, I'll just say it's a great sampler, and I like
the '90s nostalgia! The video and audio was excellent.",1410480000,2,422,4.780821917808219
