The guy was a master at his work which this video tapes includes over 90 mins of his very funny stuff from his TV show. Hard to believe the guy's been gone from us for 22 years now, but at least his stuff still lives preserved on video tape in which this particuliar one released back in the mid 90s still hasn't seen the light of day on DVD yet.
