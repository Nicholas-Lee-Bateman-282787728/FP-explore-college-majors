I will say the recent seasons have dropped in quality, but the first 10 seasons are AMAZING. I had to buy the actual DVDs because I need to be able to watch this whenever, where ever. And I have actually used this so much. I have had South Park marathons, I have lent it to friends for South Park marathons. I have used it to inspire friends to love South Park as much as me.

2581167,4,B000FP2IZU,"Great season of South Park; no complaints there. And the price is great! So why not a perfect 5-star?

1) unskippable ads before you get to the main menu on a disc. God, that's annoying. And there's a lot. Did you know that Comedy Central had other DVD's for purchase? You definitely will after popping in any of these discs! Hope you loved That's My Bush, Reno 911, Chappelle's Show and more, because you are going to be sitting there for awhile watching lengthy ads for those shows' DVD Sets before ever getting to South Park.

2) the transfer quality is not great. Or maybe it's so great that you can see all the graininess in the construction paper texture? Either way, it doesn't look amazing. South Park is lucky it's a simple looking show, because if it were any more detailed it would be much, much worse. As it stands, it's still annoying. Just reminds ya that these DVD's are really, really old in 2015 - wish there were newer sets with better transfers available. These things look better on TV now, and looked better on Netflix (before South Park went exclusively to Hulu)

So y'know, minor quibbles ultimately. But enough to knock off a star. These episodes are great, but this isn't the ideal way to experience them.",1440979200,2,1230,4.581818181818182

2581182,5,B000FP2IZU,"As others have noted, this may be the very best season of the show. (And we're now into the series' 18th season, so that's saying something!) Nearly every other season of this fabulously funny, clever, crude but surprisingly smart and thought-provoking show has a few episodes that I'm apt to skip, but in this season every single episode is a keeper for me. There are a disproportionate number of my top favorites of the entire series: Good Times with Weapons, Passion of the Jew, You Got F---'d in the A--,  The Jeffersons, Douche and Turd and Cartman's Incredible Gift are probably my top six, but the joy of South Park is that different episodes resonate for different reasons, and during this season even the comparatively mediocre episodes have a few classic moments that make them well worth seeing.

I'd heard that this series is just nonstop dopey, gross out humor, but I'd urge you to give it a chance even if that's not your preferred type of comedy. Yes, South Park is proudly (and usually amusingly!) gross, but there's also incredibly sharp, insightful wit here and some of the most clever sociopolitical satire you'll ever see on screen. The characters are memorable and the dialogue is endlessly quotable. You'll find yourself rewatching these with ridiculous frequency. HIGHLY recommended!",1416355200,,1306,4.986238532110092

2581202,5,B000FP2IZU,"Nearly every season of South Park since it's inception has been great, I'd say all but Season 15 personally. Hysterically funny, politically insightful, and better at lambasting pop culture than pretty much anyone ever has.

Season 8 of South Park was so great, so hysterical, so memorable, that it is literally on a different level than every other season. Most other seasons of South Park have lots of great episodes, but also usually have a couple bad episodes or at the very least below average episodes. Not Season 8 though, every episode is excellent! There aren't even any episodes which are only ""Good"", every single episode of this season is an ""A+"" excellent, great, hilarious episode.

If your only gonna own one season of South Park this is the season you need to buy! It's flawless!

Disc 1:
Good Times with Weapons: The boys go to the fair and convince guy at weapons booth to sell them Japanese weapons. Parts of the episode have the animation done to look like anime, and look amazing!!! Has some really great super funny songs too! Oooh, plus great Professor Chaos storyline in this episode.

Up the Down Steroid: Do you remember the episode ""Butter's Very Own Episode"" where at the end Butter's Dad is yelling out ""LIAR"", ""MURDERER"" too Robert Blake, O.J Simpson and a few other people?? If you cracked up like I did at that, your gonna fall on the floor and ruin your pants with what they do with Bonds, Sosa, and McGwire.

The Passion of the Jew: Hilarious episode, Stan & Kenny going to Mel Gibson's house to get a refund for 'Passion of the Christ' is great! Plus love when Stan says ""It'll be just like when we got our money back for Baseketball'. P.S: Mel Gibson deserves the criticism!!

You Got F'd in the A: LOL, that movie 'You Got Served' has to have the worst, most brain dead, just dumb storyline / plot of any show in the history of television!! South Park's parody of it here is GOLD!

Awesom-o: Oh God!! This is the episode that took 'South Park' to the next level of hilarity! Really the first of the Butters / Cartman episodes that we all love nowadays, gotta love this show!

Disc 2:
The Jeffersons: Tons of shows & stand up comics have lambasted Michael Jackson, but here in ""The Jeffersons"" Trey Matt rise above all of them in hilarity.

Goobacks: Simply put, one of the best comments on illegal immigration I've ever seen in entertainment media.

Douche and Turd: Okay, this is, yeah, if you've never seen this episode you NEED to watch it!! This is the greatest, most politically insightful episode of South Park ever made, and is hysterical as well!! Is a parody of 2004 Presidential Election.

Something Wall Mart This Way Comes: I gotta say with Trey and Matt being basically Libertarian style conservatives I was surprised to see them take it at Wal-Mart, and they did great job of it!

Pre-School: Non stop hilarity from beginning to end, from Cartman taking Stan, Kyle and Kenny to the lake to Butters parents forcing him to go outside and ""play"" when a bully is right at the door waiting for him, LOL!

Disc 3:
Quest for Ratings: HILARIOUS!! LOL, especially if you've ever done CCC or other cough & cold pills to get high.

Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this episode!! Paris Hilton getting taken too by Trey & Matt plus you get Butter's parents being totally abusive to him in a hilarious way, great!!

Cartman's Incredible Gift: This isn't near the best episode of Season 8, now don't get me wrong it is great, but many of the others are ridiculously awesome. However, this episode is very funny & is one of those ""the boys just being boys"" episodes that are nice break from sometimes overly political / pop culture barrage.

Woodland Critter Christmas: This is one of those South Park episodes, well for me at least, that when I first saw it I thought it was just stupid and not really good or funny at all. The only thing I laughed at I think when first seeing it was the ending, which is OMG so hilarious!!! Well after seeing it a couple more times in re runs and on DVD, I gotta say this is one of my favorite episodes of South Park, it's really great, and unique style.

So, yeah, buy this!",1370476800,,4167,4.5494652406417115

2581215,5,B000FP2IZU,"This is quite probably the single best season of South Park ever produced.  With only one exception, every single episode in this season became an instant classic.  At least 4 episodes of season 8 are in the all time top 10 episodes in South Park history.  The season opener, ""Good Times With Weapons,"" is an absolutely uproarious and pitch-perfect encapsulation of little kids ""playing pretend,"" and what happens when something goes wrong while they do it.  Many of the best moments in South Park come when the boys are just being boys- no bizarre or crazy crap going on at all- and this episode is the quintessential example of that.  They also manage to get a few jabs in against Japanese anime, and the stupidity of the reaction surrounding the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction fiasco at the end of the episode.  Other than ""Good Times With Weapons,"" some of the best episodes this season, and indeed in the history of the show, include ""AWESOM-O,"" ""The Passion of the Jew,"" ""Goobacks,"" ""Douche and Turd,"" and ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset."" ""You Got F'd in the A"" gets my personal vote for best ending to an episode ever (though actually ""Stupid Spoiled Whore..."" comes very close), and also features the much welcome return of both the South Park Goth kids as well as the Raisins girls, and it is just a pure classic episode featuring almost everyone's favorite character: Butters.  Curiously, the one exception that I noted earlier to the greatness of this season is the episode ""Quest for Ratings,"" which may just be the very worst episode in the history of the show.  Matt and Trey explain that they did this episode immediately after finishing Team America and they admit that they were completely out of good material at that point.  But they made a very quick recovery after that one blemish on this otherwise completely flawless season.",1272326400,,1857,4.832807570977918

I highly recommend SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 8TH SEASON!!!",1236556800,,401,5.184615384615385
2581219,5,B000FP2IZU,This is one of the best South Park Seasons in my opinion. 95% of the episodes on this season are absolutely hilarious and many are considered South Park classics. I recommend this season if you're looking for a new season to buy.,1233619200,,229,4.476190476190476
2581220,5,B000FP2IZU,Of course its awesome Its South Park. A group of foul mouth 4th graders that are bombarded with some of the most rediculous and offensive shinanagins imaginable.,1226016000,,161,5.0
2581224,5,B000FP2IZU,it has many good episodes such as the one where the kids turn into ninja charecters and micheal jacksln comes to town. its the bomb baby!!!!!!!!,1218585600,,144,4.576923076923077
2581225,5,B000FP2IZU,"With season 8, the South Park creators achieved a feat of true originality and utilised their genius for topical comedy like never before. There is an episode dedicated wholly to Michael Jackson and what some may call his inappropriate behaviour. There is an episode which touches on the feelings of the entire thinking public in relation to Paris Hilton. There's even an episode that takes the handicap minority of America and says. ""You're not special, you're normal, so we're going to make fun of you"" This I applaud the creators for, as it's a feeling I hold in my own regards as well. If you're going to make fun of one group of people or minority, then everything has to be fair game.

Episode 1: Good Times With Weapons: At a fairground the boys come across a store selling weapons from the Far East. They can't buy them alone and they can't get their parents to buy the weapons for them, so they trick the salesman into selling the weapons to them anyway. The episode then warps into a Japanese style Anime cartoon and shows the boys as brave martial arts warriors. Whilst exploring they come across Professor Chaos and enter in a battle to the death. Professor Chaos ends up with a Ninja throwing star in his eye and the boys realise they need to kill him to prevent getting in trouble. The only problem is, Professor Chaos has disappeared.

Episode 2: Up The Down Steroids: The Special Olympics are coming to town and Cartman is enticed by the prize money and wants to take part. The only problem is that he isn't ""Special"" so he must put on a disguise and take on the personality of a special person. There's another problem with Cartman's plan and that is, he still hasn't got an athletic bone in his body. On the other side of the episode, Jimmy and Timmy are determined to take part in the Special Olympics too. Jimmy doesn't want to lose so he starts taking steroids which affects those around him. Timmy tries to be the ethical conscience of Jimmy, the problem is that Timmy can only speak one word. TIMMY!!!

Episode 3: The Passion of the Jew: Kyle starts to become sick of Cartman's anti-semitic comments and decides to go and see Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ for himself. After watching the horrific ""Passion"" Kyle comes to question his own Jewish faith and starts the believe that Cartman was right all along. Kenny & Stan on the other hand see how it's affected Kyle and go to see The Passion as well. They hate it and decide that they must go to visit Mel Gibson and try to get their money back, whilst giving him a piece of their minds.

Episode 4: You Got F'd In The A: One day while playing with toy cars, the boys are confronted by a dance troupe who served them good. Being thrown aback by this Stan starts putting together a troupe of his own. This comprises of a video game dancer who struggles to dance without instructions. A girl from the ""Raisins"" restaurant and a Duck. The troupe isn't complete and Stan needs to find one more member. After overhearing that Butters used to be a tap dancing champion, Stan asks him to join. This opens a book of tragic memories of death created by Butters tap dancing greatness.

Episode 5: AWESOME-O: Butters receives a mail order robot called AWESOME-O that becomes Butters best friend and slave. Little does Butters realise is that AWESOME-O is actually Cartman in disguise. Rather than just end it at the first Joke, Cartman finds out that Butters has an incriminating video of Cartman dressed up as Britney Spears, dancing with a cardboard cut out of Justin Timberlake. Cartman is forced to keep up the charade until he finds out where Butters keeps the tape. Butters takes AWESOME-O on a holiday with him to Hollywood while he stays with family. AWESOME-O is picked up by movie executives and starts pitching movie idea after movie idea.

Episode 6: The Jeffersons: A Mysterious and eccentric man and his son move into town. He's Mr. Inappropriate as when his son Blanket makes friends with the boys, Mr. Jefferson thinks he's their best friend too and takes part in sleep overs and plays games with the boys. The boys become concerned that Mr. Jefferson is more concerned with remaining a kid himself rather than being a father figure to blanket. Cartman doesn't help matters as he's too concerned with Mr. Jefferson staying his best friend, regardless of how insane it may be.

Episode 7: Goobacks: A mysterious time portal opens up in the middle of nowhere and mysterious people start coming through, looking for cheap work and living conditions. South Park learns that these people are a new human race from the future which their language and appearance is a blend of all languages and races from the boys time. These appearances of these mysterious people starts to take work from native South Park residence, sparking a debate as to whether these Goobacks should be allowed to just enter South Park without any checks or permission. Sound familiar?

Episode 8: Douche and Turd: South Park Elementary is forced by PETA to get rid of their cow mascot and are forced to choose something more animal friendly. As a joke the boys nominate that the school mascot should either be a giant douche or a giant turd sandwich. Stan, thinking it's a stupid idea to vote for such a thing decides that he's not going to vote at all. This makes him an outcast and he's eventually provoked by P.Diddy and his Vote or Die campaign. Stan, still not willing to vote is kicked out of South Park and forced to find refuge with PETA who, he finds out really love animals... Really love them... Really. Meanwhile back in South Park the debate rages on as to whether a giant douche or a turd sandwich should represent South Park Elementary.

Episode 9: Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes: A Wall-Mart superstore opens in South Park and the citizens become hypnotised by their low low prices. Although they love the low low prices of Wall-Mart, they're also torn by the fact that this mega mall is turning South Park into a ghost town. Over time the superstore starts to cripple the small South Park businesses and the boys start to investigate how they can take it down for good. They don't realise that taking down Wall-Mart is going to be a harder task than they first thought.

Episode 10: Pre-School: While the boys where in pre-school they play a game called fireman. This is a game where they light a fire and put it out by peeing on it. This goes wrong as the boys fail to put the fire out, the teacher tries and catches fire herself which doesn't kill her but it cripples her for life. The boys place the blame on a bully and he's sent to Juvenile hall for a number of years. Flash to the present and the bully is due to be released from ""Juvy,"" so the boys decide that in order to prevent any repercussions from the bully and to get protection, they must make amends with the teacher who's life they have ruined.

Episode 11: Quest for Ratings: The boys have their own school new show and find themselves in a battle for ratings against a show created by Craig. Yep, that's it.

Episode 12: Stupid Spoiled W**re Video Playset: Paris Hilton has become a phenomena in South Park and most girls all aspire to be as slutty as Paris is. Wendy is disgusted by this and seeks the help of Mr. Slave who she wants to teach her how to be as big a slut as Paris Hilton. Mr. Slave is disgusted by this and seeks to teach the girls that there's more to life than being a filthy slut. Meanwhile Paris Hilton comes to town and wants to buy Butters after her dog, Tinkerbell kills itself. Butters doesn't want to be bough by Hilton so the parents make him a deal that if he can make $200 Million on his own, then he can stay living with his parents.

Episode 13: Cartman's Incredible Gift: Cartman gets into an accident after trying to learn to fly. Waking up in hospital he finds out he has a psychic gift which he uses to help solve the crimes of a serial killer. This gift gets Cartman into more trouble than he can possibly imagine.

Episode 14: Woodland Critter Christmas: Stan comes across a group of Christmas critters who seek the help of Stan so they can give birth to their lord saviour the Anti-Christ.

A wonderfully original season that I think all South Park fans will love. Admittedly, this season has a few duds but mostly the season is perfect from start to finish.",1215302400,,8341,4.540252827677977
2581226,3,B000FP2IZU,"...since I wrote a review on a South Park DVD boxset, in fact it's almost been a couple of years.

Anyway, since I wrote my review on Season 7 back in April 2006, I've grown up a fair bit. So for those who read my previous reviews, it's all changed. I watched these episodes back in August/September 2006, when this set first came out, but never got around to reviewing the box back then for some reason.

Disc 1:
Good Times With Weapons: Personally, this episode didn't (and still doesn't) do much for me, as I grew out of anime a few years ago. 6/10

Up The Down Steroid: Better than GTWW, one of the better ones in this season. 7.5/10

Passion Of The Jew: Again, didn't do much for me, the whole Passion Of The Christ stuff simply didn't interest me. 5.5/10

You Got F-d in The A: Good storyline, but kinda weird at the same time (I don't know why, it seemed South Park changed a lot between Season 7 and Season 8, or it might just be me) 7/10

AWESOM-O: One of the better episodes of this season. God Cartman is evil sometimes! 9/10

Disc 2:
The Jeffersons: Michael Jackson was (and still is) a target for humour, again more classic Cartman, but still not as good as an average Season 3-7 episode. 8/10

Goobacks: Don't really like this episode for some reason, though the gay man pile is slightly funny. 5/10

Douche And Turd: Failed to meet my expectations, and that scene where Stan gets thrown out of town on a cow and gets a bucket put on his head? That is NOT funny! 4/10

Something This Wal-Mart Way Comes: Again, failed to meet expectations, okay for what it is, but it does make me want to go to Wal-Mart! 6/10

Pre-School: Another interesting (but mildly funny, no serious laughs like previous seasons), episode, nice piece of back history. 6.5/10

Disc 3:
Quest For Ratings: The whole 'Close Up Of Animals' concept is funny at first, but not enough to sustain a whole show. 6/10

Stupid Spoiled Whore Playset: Nowhere near as good as I thought it would be, and the Paris goes up Mr. Slave's butt scene is just a rip-off of the Lemmiwinks episode, which was both funnier and more disturbing. 5/10

Cartman's Incredible Gift: Ms. Crabtree dies for some reason, not that made much of a difference anyway, unlike a certain operation in the first episode of Season 9... Married with Children did a better psychic episode  back in 1992 anyway, worth checking that show out. 6.5/10

Woodland Critter Christmas: The best of this season by far, this was the last episode (although we didn't know about it at the time) that Mr. Garrison was still Mr. Garrison. VERY funny. 10/10

I'm not sure whether it's just me, but my advice to new South Park fans would be to watch all the seasons before this one first, and if you like this one (more than I did), then go on to Season 9 and 10. It's all downhill from this season on, I'm afraid...............",1204070400,,2853,4.445297504798464
2581227,5,B000FP2IZU,"This in my opinion is the best season of South Park.  This has the Osimo epsiode that is hilarious, frankly this whole season is very funny, I don't think there is a weak episode in this season, and I cant say that about any of the other seasons.

2581230,5,B000FP2IZU,"What can I say really, except that South Park's season 8 is probably one of their best yet. It includes memorable and hysterical episodes including ""Douche and Turd"", which poked fun at the last presidential election, ""Awesom-O"", where Cartman pretends to be a robot so he could learn all of Butters' secrets, and my favorite ""The Jeffersons"", a father and son who move to South Park to live with a bunch of hicks who don't know anything. There are many other episodes on here which you may enjoy, including ""Good Times With Weapons"", ""Up the Down Steroid"", ""The Passion of the Jew"", ""You Got F'd in the A"", ""Goobacks"", ""Something Wallmart this way Comes"", ""Pre-School"", ""Quest for Ratings"", ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"", ""Cartman's Incredible Gift"", and last but not least, ""Woodland Critter Christmas"".

To me, it is by far the best season, EVERY episode is laugh-out-loud hilarious, and makes some GREAT points in it's ingenious satire.  This would be my recommendation to anybody looking to buy their first season, or just getting into the show.  I can't pick a favorite DISK even, let alone favorite episode.  I think Season 9 is the only season that even gets close to season 8 in greatness, but Season 9 had a few ""good"" episodes, while all of 8's are ""GREAT.""  I've rambled on enough for now.  Buy it.

This was a great season, but the two following it have sucked in my opinion, with only a few good episodes. Hopefully this isn't a trend for them as I really like this show.",1172016000,2,397,4.2105263157894735

Trey Parker and Matt Stone really take the humor of their episodes to the next level during this season.  I honestly can't find an episode that really sucked during their 8th season.

2581255,5,B000FP2IZU,"It's easy to gush about South Park, with its astute satires and outrageous waaaay-over-the-line humor, but the 8th season has to be one of the best yet. And it's an especially good season for Butters fans (""Good Times with Weapons"", ""I Got F'd in the A"", and ""Awesom-o""). A few of the highlights:

* An inventive shift in animation style makes ""Good Times with Weapons"" unique (and a precursor to their more recent World of Warcraft parody), but the Butters subplot is so far over the line that even South Park's biggest fans will squirm. Now *that's* an accomplishment!

* ""Up the Down Steroid"" is an instant classic and a great showcase for Jimmy and Timmy fans. The Cartman montage sequence is hilarious!

* ""I Got F'd in the A"" -- All I have to say is: ""I've got something in my front pocket ... for you."" :)

* In ""Awesom-o"", Matt and Trey risked viewer wrath again (cf. the postponed revelation of Cartman's mom's identiy back in 1998) by having promised an episode on the return of Lemmiwinks only to deliver ""Awesome-o"" instead.

* ""The Jeffersons"" parodies Michael Jackson, and sure, there are the obvious jabs at his alleged molestation, etc., but the funniest stuff (in my opinion) is the stuff about his alleged plastic surgery.

* ""Goobacks"" -- Four words: ""They took yer job!"" ;)

* ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" is an absolutely twisted, absolutely brilliant Christmas episode. ""Hail Satan!"" ;)

* And the best of the best, ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"". What more could South Park aspire to than a whore-off between Paris Hilton and Mr. Slave? This is one of their best and most outrageous ever.",1167782400,,1617,4.75

South Park makes it happen. It just keeps getting better and better and is not afraid to push the limits. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are two geniuses who aren't afraid to speak their minds and do it in the most creative and funny way possible. I talk about this show in my daily life and anyone who doesn't understand this humor needs to wake up.",1162771200,4,516,4.329896907216495

As always the makers of Southpark succeed to brilliantly mock society, recent events and stereotype the American way of life.

""Beef"" between a south park dancing crew and the boys, the man-child Michael Jackson with a child on his own moves into Soutpark, people coming in from the future to work who somehow make you wonder what that reminds you of, the unevitable and hypnotising attraction of Wall-mart, the quest for ratings of rivalling TV shows , Paris Hilton with her own Stupid Spoiled whore product and al always many, many of Cartmans brilliant, ignorant, blunt, shameless, rude, spoiled , respectless behaviour.

To put it short : hilarious. But be careful! Don't watch this if a naked Cartman might upset you!",1162684800,,924,4.910256410256411

This season has its standouts, most notably the truly demented Christmas Critters episode, but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes.

To make matters worse, Matt and Trey put next to no effort into providing any extras for fans who pony up top dollar for the dvd collections.  A show like the Simpsons not only has more episodes per season and sells for the same price but the people involved in the Simpsons go the extra mile to satisfy fans:  full episode commentaries with writers, producers, directors, voice actors, etc as well as deleted scenes and other special features.  Matt and Trey provide generally uninteresting ""mini commentaries.""  No doubt about it, the boys are just generally ""phoning it in"" at this point, seemingly caring only about continuing their franchise and maximizing their profits for as little effort as possible.",1157414400,7,1020,4.970588235294118
2581264,5,B000FP2IZU,"Season 8 includes more amazing South Park episodes with topics that remain relevant and fresh.  Every time South Park comes out with an incredible episode, I think they have reached their zenith and every time I think that, they prove me wrong.  Their take on steroids using the Special Olympics as well as their coverage of Walmart and Michael Jackson are new highs.  Every season since season three (which, on a whole, I don't really care for) has gotten better and better.  Here are the episodes from Season 8:

""Good Times with Weapons""--The boys buy martial arts weapons at the county fair and dive into the world of anime.  In a showdown with Professor Chaos, Kenny gets carried away and throws a star blade into Butters' eye.  The boys are afraid they will get grounded.  In the end, the town is more concerned when Cartman's naked invisibility powers malfunction.

""Up the Down Steroid""--One of my favorites.  Cartman thinks if he pretends to be mentally challenged, he's a shoe-in to win the Special Olympics.  Meanwhile, Jimmy wants to win so badly he is willing to use steroids.  Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds, and Jason Giambi make an ""appearance"" to symbolize that kids should never cheat (yeah, right).  Classic, I love the part where Cartman ""trains"" to be mentally challenged and when he tries to complete in the events, but the Jimmy beating up his girlfriend bit was a little much.

""The Passion of the Jew""--Boy, is this all of a sudden relevant again.  Cartman convinces Kyle to watch The Passion of the Christ and Kyle is so traumatized, he begins to question his faith.  Cartman then organizes a movement reminiscent of something that happened in Germany 70 years ago.  Meanwhile, Stan and Kenny try to get their theatre ticket money back by confronting Mel Gibson.  The Gibson scenes are way over-the-top.

""I Got F'd in the A""--The boys get ""served"" by Orange County dancers and the adults seem to care more about the situation than the boys.  When Stan's dad teaches his son to dance, Stan serves up the other kids and ""it's on"" (whatever).

""Awesom-o""--Another one of my favorites.  Cartman pretends to be Butters' personal robot to get dirt on him, but when Butters lets it be known that he has video of Cartman in an embarrassing situation, Cartman has to play robot longer than he expected.  Soon ""Awesom-o"" will be used by movie producers to come up with film ideas and be the object the government wants to convert into a weapon. Great scene:  when the movie producer asks ""Awesom-o"" if he's been programmed to pleasure humans.

""The Jeffersons""--One of SP's all-time best!!  Michael, uh, Jefferson and his son Blanket move into South Park but Kyle is concerned Mr. Jefferson ""just seems like he wants to be a kid, not have one.""  Mr. Jefferson thinks everyone is just ""ignorant.""  Great scenes:  Stan's dream (yuck),and ""Got your nose.""  The music is good, too.

""Goobacks""--People from the over-populated future come to the past seeking employment and blue collar workers from the present protest that these ""goobacks"" are taking their jobs.  These workers have a solution: to turn gay so as to stop future generations.

""Douche and Turd""--PETA is forcing South Park Elementary to change their cow mascot.  Kyle and Cartman compete with two different write-in candidates.  Stan does not see the point in choosing between a giant douche and a turd sandwich; not even Puff Daddy's ""Vote or Die"" threats will persuade him.

""Something Wall*Mart This Way Comes""--What's up with that title?  Wall*Mart comes to South Park and everything changes, especially Stan's dad, who goes a bit mad.

""Pre-School""--A tough kid the boys betrayed back in pre-school and had sent to juvenile hall is out on parole.

""Quest for Ratings""--The boys' school news show is getting smoked in the ratings, so they need to jazz it up.

""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset""--All the girls want to be like Paris Hilton.  Wendy does not think Paris is a proper role model but, when she is ditched by her friends, she is about to give in.  Mr. Slave saves the day by competing with Paris in a whore-off.

""Cartman's Incredible Gift""--After being in a coma, police detectives believe Cartman has developed psychic powers to identify serial killers.  Of course, many innocent people are arrested as a result.

""Woodland Critter Christmas""--Now this story is twisted.  Stan helps a group of animals prepare for the birth of their savior only to find out they are devil worshippers.  The last line of the story is hilarious.",1157155200,44,4517,4.89064558629776
2581265,5,B000FP2IZU,"I am a relatively new South Park fan - haven't been watching since it debuted many years ago, but still love it nonetheless. Season 8 is just as hilarious, just as offensive, and just as wonderful! My favorite episode by far is ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset."" I'm not a Paris Hilton fan, and this episode says it all! Rejoice in 14 classic episodes, such as ""Good Times With Weapons"", ""Awesome-O"", and ""Woodland Critter Christmas."" Keep the laughs coming with South Park season 8. It is truly worth every cent.",1156896000,3,516,4.7444444444444445
2581266,5,B000FP2IZU,"i think south parkis like the best show in the world so is family guy but u cant beat s park with anything. 1 sad thing is that kenny does not die in seasons after 5 and in 6 my favorite character kenny what sadly only in the last episode of the season i own seasons 1-8 i know 8 didn't come out yet but at a place called cd island they have dvds before they come out. i think that the best episode of this show ever was on season 9 and the episode was about the kids playing baseball but they really haTED IT and they kept winning episode was hilarious.

i think anybody who likes south park must get season 8 you must .also the episode when the boys play with weapons is also a favorite so if you like south park comedy buy season 8

P.S. if youreally like south park buy seasons 1-7 witch r also hilarous",1156723200,3,807,3.9753086419753085
2581267,5,B000FP2IZU,"South Park Kick *ss 8th season is my 3rd best favorite season after season 3 and season 5. Ought to see this unbelievably-irreverent-yet-entertaining animated TV series. One of my favorite episodes are of course ""Good Times with weapon"" & ""Passion of the Jew""",1155859200,,259,5.046511627906977

2581269,5,B000FP2IZU,"Sometimes things just get better with age.  Take the eighth season of South Park for example, which somehow found creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker pushing the limits of of cable television even further in these fourteen episodes.  The season begins simple enough, spoofing anime and Dragonball Z in the first episode (""Good Times With Weapons"") and break dancing and the dim movie You Got Served (""You Got F'd in the A""), and then things take a very different (and even funnier) turn with the ""The Passion of the Jew"" as Cartman takes his love for Mel Gibson and the Passion of the Christ to a new level as Stan and Kenny try to get their money back after seeing the film.  Disabled Jimmy is willing to go to any lengths to win the special olympics in ""Up the Down Steroid"" (take that Barry Bonds!) while ""Goobacks"" became an instant classic taking on the illegal immigration issue with a hilarious sci-fi twist.  The second half of the season gets even better with ""The Jeffersons"" as a strange man with a fondness for children who bears a striking resemblance to the King of Pop moves into town, ""Douche and Turd"" which puts a spin on the election and the very, very little choice anyone has in the matter, ""Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes"" in which the mega store comes to town and the kids try to find a way to combat the evil within it, Paris Hilton gets unbelieavbly scathed in ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"", and the closing Christmas episode ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" may very well go down in history as one of the best episodes in the history of the series.  For the most part, season after season, the boys behind the mayhem of South Park manage to attack current issues and events with unabashed glee, and this season was no different.  All in all, the eighth season of South Park only furthers the notion that the show is still going strong, and here's hoping it never stops.",1153785600,66,1902,4.595870206489676

2581271,5,B000FP2IZU,"Everybody seems to think that, lately, South Park has gotten too preachy to be funny. I beg to differ. While, yes, the political satire can be irrtating at times, I like the metaphorical approach the show has been taking in some of the latter episodes. And to be honest, this season made me laugh harder than at any time since I started watching this show nine years ago. Of course, I said that about every season prior to this one. I do think that the creative minds behind this show are really good at topping themselves and have done a great job of staying fresh and funny for the last decade. I will definitely buy this box set and the ones that follow. I am also very happy that new episodes will follow for the next two years. My only is that they are just as funny.

Episode reviews;

1. Good times with weapons- I love the anime in this episode. The only time I have EVER enjoyed anime. Period. That and the whole Butters taking a ninja star in the eye thing. Classic.

2. You got F'd in the A- This episode serves to reinforce why I hate boy bands. That, and the pointlessness of the movie 'You got served'.

3. The Passion of the Jew- The single funniest episode of the season. Not my favorite, though. How could you not laugh at the sight of Cartman leading a bunch of unsuspecting idiots in an anti-semitic chant while dressed as Adolf Hitler?

4. Awesom-O- Just when you thought Cartman couldn't get any worse or weirder, this one proves he can. I love this episode, especially the part when Butters finally figures out that the robot is really Cartman.

5. Up the down steroid- I hate to say it, but they voiced my feelings about steroids in sports w/o saying it. I especially enjoyed the scene with Timmy going to Mr. Mackey's office. Classic stuff.

6. Goobacks- My favorite episode of the season. It voices my feelings about both illegal immigration and hippy liberal douchebags without incriminating me.

7. The Jeffersons- Dude, I knew that was Kenny. I frickin' knew it. Classic death scene.

8. Douche and Turd- Reinforcing my belief that the PETA losers need to go. And poking fun at the electoral process. Also proved that the only reason people want you to vote is so you'll support their cause. Which is why I don't vote.

9. Something Wall-Mart this way comes- As a victim of the events depicted here, to a lesser degree, I whole-heartedly endorse the message here. And I also can relate to pointless 2 a.m. shopping sprees in the Wal-Mart DVD section.

10. Pre-School- I just think the whole allusion to the original Star Trek pilot was the best.

11. Quest for ratings- Proof positive that Robi-tripping is useful. Simple, effective, funny.

12. Stupid spoiled whore video playset- I wish would some gay guy would banish Paris Hilton to the depths of their anus. And save room for Nicole Ritchie while they are at it.

13. Cartman's Incredible Gift- It's a shame about Mrs. Crabtree.

14. Woodland Critter Christmas- Satanic animals in a blood orgy equals comic gold.

I loved this season. And I can't wait for the DVD to come out. Or the new season, for that matter. South Park is a great show and I hope it continues until the boys are in high school.",1151798400,53,3181,4.525305410122164
2581272,5,B000FP2IZU,"season 8 is probably the best of the seasons. i've forgotten which episodes are on this season but pretty sure (from the cover) the south park anime episode is on here, the awesome- o one, erection day (i think) and all the other hilarious episodes that came with this season. for everyone saying that south park began to get bum after the 6th or 7th season obviously had their t.v.'s turned off during the later seasons. the writing on the later seasons seems to me that the staff didn't care anymore and just wrote about everything. and it was excellent. to not skip on this. i will own this the day it's released.",1150070400,10,616,4.460176991150442
