8649243,3,B00JAD6ERQ,"This is another collection of recycled films. There are three discs of Echo Bridge five films. It appears they simply mix and match these discs to create different multi-packs. By ""American"" they mean American made and not that the stories take place in American. About half the films are lame made for TV offerings. It also uses two shorts from the Ray Bradbury 1985/86 HBO series as part of the ""15.""

If I was on a budget, I would pass this by for different multi-pack.

Available at Walmart stores less expensive than the Amazon offering.",1404777600,5,542,4.6947368421052635
