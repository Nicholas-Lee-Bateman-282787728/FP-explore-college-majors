8036605,1,B00061UI2S,This was incredibly boring. Made with little to no budget--and it shows. More like having a history book read to you with a few one-dimentional pictures added.,1441238400,,159,4.925925925925926
8036606,4,B00061UI2S,"This is a one-woman play portraying Jonathan Edwards's wife writing to a daughter. The letter covers their courtship, babies, and relationship to the people of the parish. It includes happy events and tragedies, ending in the reason for the letter and the quote from Jonathan Edwards about his marriage, 'An Uncommon Union'.

This is a rather plain, unpolished and inexpensively produced DVD, but it gets the message across effectively and appropriately.

I got the DVD after recently reading a very intensive book about the scholarly work of Pastor Jonathan Edwards. His work doesn't show a personal side. I wanted to know more about the person who wrote so passionately about God, Heaven, and Hell.

I know Jonathan Edwards better now that I have watched this very simple but powerful presentation.",1329696000,2,800,5.138461538461539
8036607,5,B00061UI2S,"The title Uncommon Union refers to the relationship Jonathan Edwards had with his wife Sarah.

The movie is adapted form a one woman stage performance. It is mostly monologue. But instead of one woman on a stage this movie has her in various setting and various costumes. The movie story line is her writing remembrances to their eleven children of her husband, their marriage and their ministry.

She tells of their many hardships using the kind of language common to that era. She gracefully weaves biblical responses to the challenges that gave them hope and strength to endure. This long narrative is an eloquent testimony of the goodness and grace of God to take special care of His people during times of greatest difficulty.

This movie is highly recommended viewing to get an insider viewpoint of one person that greatly impacted church history. And it is evident that his wife played a huge role his success.",1191110400,3,917,4.865384615384615
