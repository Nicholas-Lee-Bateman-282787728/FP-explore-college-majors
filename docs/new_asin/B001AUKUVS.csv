3467360,4,B001AUKUVS,"To be honest this movie moves very slow.  It has its moments when it grabs your attention and moments when you yawn.  It is not exactly boring but it definitely is not Academy Award fare.

The love interests don't go far enough.  One kiss and holding hands--WOW! The acting is reasonably good.  The value of the film is elevated by the appearance of the legendary Mickey Rooney.  Without him it would be Dudsville.

So, with that, I wonder why at times I found tears running down my cheek.  I wonder why I felt like hugging the characters when certain emotional scenes played.  I wanted to pet the horses.  And the wolf scene!  That wolf was not ferocious.  I would not have been afraid to walk up and pat him on the head.  I think he would have run away, or licked my hand. It must have took some heavy training to get him to snarl the way he did.

So, in conclusion I rate the movie 4 stars because of the family connection.  It was definitely a G-rated movie.  It would definitely be suited for every member of the family. And that, we need more of.",1250208000,2,1052,4.290816326530612
3467361,5,B001AUKUVS,"As a parent, I love it when I can find a movie that I feel comfortable viewing with the whole family.  I find it extremely refreshing to see a movie portray strong family values and such a heart-felt message.  To see the legendary Mickey Rooney AND the beautiful scenery of rural North Carolina in this film were an added bonus!  I definitely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a Great Family Film!",1243900800,3,406,4.534246575342466
3467362,5,B001AUKUVS,"This is a very sweet movie.  For modern audiences who expect thrills and chills at every turn - well, it isn't going to happen.  It's a pretty old-fashioned story, with Mickey Rooney very nicely cast in the role that calls for a ""Mickey Rooney"" type.  Roger Willie does a great turn as well.  The kid who is at the center of the drama,(Jake), seems to have two emotions, and I think he could have been better cast, but otherwise the film seems to be nicely cast.  David Rotan is a young director and I expect to see good things from him in the future.  The movie was beautifully photographed and the scenery is part of what makes this a movie to embrace. It doesn't pretend to be anything except what it is, a very sweet movie. It's a movie that children can watch with grandparents, and the parents in the room won't be embarrassed for either to see it.  I hope there's a sequel, and they could show the story of the gang that the main character was a part of, or the ""Bullied Teen"" (who gets beaten up early on by the gang) with the focus on how his life was changed by what happened.  I think there could be a family oriented series here, whether Mr. Rooney is able to be involved or not.  This was filmed in NC.",1239494400,3,1215,4.225108225108225

3467364,5,B001AUKUVS,"This film is super.  It was filmed only a few minutes from where I live.  I actually got to meet my hero Mickey Rooney on the set of this film.  It's a beautiful family picture.  No bad language or themes. :)
I went to see it in the theatre and was not disappointed.
Mickey and his wife Jan both have great roles.  What a treat to see MY HERO in another horse film.  Mickey (even at 87) still has it!  What a legend, what a talent.  His wife Jan also is great.  She plays his wife.  What a treat.  The entire movie was enjoyable and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!!!  Buy it today!!!

3467365,1,B001AUKUVS,"I can't figure out who this movie is supposed to appeal to.  Despite the title, there aren't enough horses for the horse lovers.  It's too slow to hold the attention of little kids, too corny and predictable for older kids and adults.  And wolf advocates won't be happy with the ridiculous sequence of a vicious snarling wolf going after some kids.  Why do we keep seeing scenes like this in movies?  All it does is feed the fear and hatred of wolves so many uninformed people feel.  The fact is, there has never been a documented account of a healthy, unprovoked wild wolf attacking a human.  It just doesn't happen, folks!",1220832000,4,624,4.5675675675675675
3467366,4,B001AUKUVS,"No overpaid, under-worked Hollywood stars other than Mickey Rooney; no sex; no violence - just the thing for families looking for something they can watch together at home. True, there is no big production budget and the actors will never win an Oscar, but this movie proves that good entertainment can be filmed in the U.S. (in rural North Carolina); explosions and gunfire do not a movie make.

This is a simple story about the pain a teenaged boy feels at the loss of his father and how that pain led him astray. He finds the better path again when he and his widowed mother go to a kind of dude ranch where the boy learns to take care of horses and to be a mentor to a younger, goofier kid. There is even a love interest for the boy, but it goes no further than a kiss and holding hands.

Buy this and give it to families who have kids 8-15.",1219795200,7,845,4.209876543209877

8279732,1,B001AUKUVS,"With all due respect to those who found this such a wonderful family film-----all I can say is that I am very glad that I streamed it from Netflix and did not pay extra to see it.  The horses were in very few scenes.  Indeed, it really had nothing much, at all, to do with horses.  It had some of the worst acting  I have ever seen, some scenes were so predictable as to be ridiculous!  And that silly piano music--which was, obviously, supposed to be moving, got on my last nerve!!!  The woman who played  Jake's mother turned in one of the worst acting jobs I have ever had the misfortune to witness.  My advice, if you enjoy good films, is AVOID this one!!!!!",1308960000,,662,4.24
