8262129,5,B0016CDSUA,Ok...I know this guy may be the butt of some jokes..his workout dvds have been out there a while...If you want to work your upper body and not go to a gym..it's good workout.  I know there a lot of other workout dvds out there...some go overboard...say p90x that about kills you....this is just right.  I've had this dvd for years...while many other dvds have come and gone..I find myself coming back to this one.,1498262400,,413,4.493333333333333
8262130,4,B0016CDSUA,"I had, dare I say, this fitness video in VCR.  I decided to buy it in DVD for the simple fact I can fast forward to the next set.  It is great for beginners, whom may not know how to begin a weightlifting routine.  Good guidance, but he is wordy...chatty Cathy, so having it on DVD makes it more tailored to getting the workout done and over in less time without the narrative.",1439424000,,377,4.136986301369863
8262131,5,B0016CDSUA,"Basedow's Basics provides the tools to better fitness and health through innovative exercises that strenghten and tone from head-to-toe.  John's simple, motivational approach has taught me that I too can achieve my fitness goals through persistance and dedication.  I've been using this tape for nearly three months now, and not only do I look better but I feel better, too.  The results are amazing.",1143244800,,400,5.21875
8262132,5,B0016CDSUA,"John's Fitness made simple program is ""Simply the Best"". This video AWESOME HOUR UPPER BODY HOME WORKOUT (his dogs are evidence to the fact that he is at home not at the gym too) has an incredible workout that will leave you feeling pumped and ready to take on the world. John speaks to you in a very personal way and explains the proper technique as you go along set by set and rep by rep. I have lost 30 pounds and 5 inches off my waist. I am now at an amazing 11% body fat and I owe it all to Fitness Made Simple and John Basedow......!!! You cannot go wrong buying AWESOME HOUR UPPER BODY HOME WORKOUT or any video by John Basedow, I know first hand they work....!!",1110672000,,669,4.114503816793893
8262133,5,B0016CDSUA,"This is the first and the only tape that shows you how to get definition and strength working out at home.  All fitness regimines that teach you how to define your chest, arms, triceps, etc.... always show tons of gym equipment, or they have routines done at home that just do not produce results.  The Fitness Made Simple Upper Body Workout is the only one that can be done at home and produce better results than most gym equipment can.  John lays it all out for you and I loved that I understood what to do, how to do it, why I was doing it, and bottom line loved the results it gave me in just a few weeks!  This is the best upper body workout I have ever done, and even though I go to a gym now just to get out of the house, I still utilize all the concepts and the same exercises because they simply are the best ones I can do to get the results that I want to achieve.  I highly recommend this video!",1107820800,,907,4.016666666666667
8262134,5,B0016CDSUA,"People should invite John Basedow tapes into their homes and into their lives because he's all about results.
As a young woman who's training to be a fitness model, I can singlehandedly thank John Basedow for his encouragement to pursue my dreams. You can see me on some of his ads because I genuinely believe in his programs.
FMS: A practical approach for achieving results, routines/nutrition

Sixpack Abs: 3 different routines for the upper, obliques, and
  hard to build lower abs. This tape rocks
Awesome Hour: Men aren't the only ones trying to look cut!
  This tape is jam packed with routines for the
  delts, pecs, lats, triceps (french press!) and
  biceps. Plus you get to watch JB's dogs take a nap.
  You won't find that kind of at-home feel on any
  other tape. And, there's an Ab routine as well..
John always includes nutrition tips--and that's also a rarity
in the fitness video industry..normally it's only about exercise.
Buy these videos, you won't be disappointed but you have to work hard!",1041724800,3,1011,4.808139534883721

8262137,5,B0016CDSUA,I have just purchased this video about 1 month ago.  This video is a great workout!  In this video John talks you right through everything and you know exactly what to do.  The best thing about this is you can do the exercises right from HOME!  This video IS easy to follow.,1038873600,,274,4.211538461538462
8262138,1,B0016CDSUA,"I EXCERCISED MY ARM
I purchased this video and used it three (3) times.  First was to review it.  Second was to use it.  The Third Time - I got my excercise in the arms by throwing it out in the garbage.  This video was produced poorly and the sound quality reverberates and it is irritating to where you cannot take this serious.  It sounds like porno music.  If you have seen the commercials you can hear the music in the background although it is faint.  Borrow one from a friend first and you can judge for yourself.  Working out with that music and the speech echos is just too much for me to bear.  Sorry John Basedow but your performance was good but the video is just terrible.  Try again.
