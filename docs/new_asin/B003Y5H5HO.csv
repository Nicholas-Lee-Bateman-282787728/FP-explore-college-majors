4219455,4,B003Y5H5HO,"Having not read the novel, and only seeing the 2009 version from Sweden, David Fincher's The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo isn't all that different from the previous one. No surprises I mean (other than a different ending), but I did think the cast is better and the whole look of the film is much richer thanks to the director's vision. This is suspense mystery that feels more like a typical drama at times. Be ready to sit back and absorb a huge amount of dialogue with people just sitting around, especially in the first hour, but it does move rather fast after that point. It feels like the 2 hour and 40 minutes that it is, though it doesn't drag quite as much as the earlier version.

Noomi Rapace was excellent as Lisbeth Salander, but I like Rooney Mara's performance a little bit more. She somehow manages to make her gothic appearance look odd and attractive at the same time. Her line delivery is fantastic and whenever she is on the screen you simply can't look away. She has already received a Golden Globe nomination, but I think maybe an Oscar could be in her future. Daniel Craig is at his best here as Mikael Blomkvist and a big improvement over the previous rendition of the character. I actually believed his connection with Lisbeth this time around.

The brutal scenes that people who have read the book or have seen the 2009 movie know they are coming and are pushed even further here in terms of what is actually seen. If you don't know what is coming, prepare to brace yourself. The lady sitting behind me said ""disgusting"" more than once.

Special mention for the opening credits. A new cover of the ""Immigrant Song"" plays over black oil colliding and making various shapes and characters in the story. I thought I was watching the next Daniel Craig Bond movie.

I have had a trend over the last two years of seeing the most depressing movies right before Christmas. First Black Swan and now TGWTDT. It looks like next year will be The Hobbit, so maybe then I can redeem myself from becoming a total holiday Grinch.",1324598400,6,2038,4.544959128065395
4219456,3,B003Y5H5HO,"Having read all the books years ago, the story itself really never did anything for me. It's really all about Salander. Fincher did a competent if procedural job. The main complaint here is he rushes through the flat pages of dialog with no pause or rhythm at all. Many scenes involve the actors simply going through motions reciting their memorized lines with few touches of humanity.

Neither movie is more than a cheap Saturday scare and to sum it up, put the cast from the Swedish film in one directed by Fincher and you've got the real deal. The most telling contrast in both movies that show where they stand is in the scene where Salander and Blomkvist are lying in bed toward the end and the writer muses to his ass kicking hacker about what she has been through. In one movie, the scene is quiet and human and the other movie, it's simply filler to the next scene. I fault Steve Zaillian's simplistic screenplay more than anything else. The Swedish one wisely compresses and simplifies many of the novels blatant flaws, while the Gringo version keeps all the boring warts.  Let's not ignore a ""new"" ending that requires an extraordinary suspension of disbelief or complete incompetence on the part of everybody else in the plot.

Rooney Mara does a good, if robotic job playing Larsen's motorcycle driving Goth, hacker, sex pot, but I kept looking for the one and only Noomi Rapace at every turn. Hard act to follow. Either in writing or how she was directed, Mara's Salander plays more of a young girl in love with older man, than the distant cautious (and damaged) Salander of Rapace - which is rightly or wrongly, more in line with the book and frankly more realistic. i'm not taking anything away from Rooney Mara's work, she was brave and really good. I just prefer Noomi Rapace's interpretation.

Also WTF? with the James Bond intro? Wrong movie Fincher...",1324598400,10,1871,4.695121951219512
4219457,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Last year, the Swedish version of Stieg Larsson's novel of the same name was my favorite movie of the year.  I know, it was released in 2009, but in my area it hit theaters in 2010.  In any case, it was and is a great film.  How could it be improved and why would an American director want to try?  I was very skeptical.  American filmmakers don't usually improve on originals, but there are some exceptions.  Ironically, a recent re-do from Sweden is another example.  I loved ""Let the Right One In"", but thought ""Let Me In"" was a modest improvement.

Director David Fincher pulls it off here as well.  There are differences between the two films but they are not substantive.  What is different is the production value.  More on that in a minute.  The opening pushes you back in your seat with Led Zeppelin's ""The Immigrant Song"" covered by Karen O and Trent Reznor.  It plays over a series of fluid steel grey images.  It's hard to describe, but it gets your attention.  The plot differs little from the previous movie and presumably the novel (which I haven't read).  The editor of a Swedish magazine is found guilty of liable based on questionable journalism.  His finances are decimated and his magazine is in jeopardy of going under.  Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig at his best), needing income accepts the position of biographer for one of Sweden's wealthiest men and the head of a family that includes former Nazi's in its ranks.

Mikael's real job however is to find out what happened to the niece of the ranking family head (Christopher Plummer).  The niece who was 16 at the time of her disappearance in the mid-1960's, is believed to have been murdered and Henrik (Plummer) believes family members were responsible.  He wants Mikael to investigate.  Needing help he hires Lisbeth Salander (award-worthy Rooney Mara) who had been recommended by the family's attorney.  Mikael is unaware that she had been doing a background investigation on him as part of Henrik's vetting process.

Mara jumps into this role with both feet, as well as other body parts, and is remarkable.  She brings a smoldering fury to the character that has sociopathic tendencies, the result of abuse as a child.  We don't know the details (next movie) but it's there.  Lisbeth is a bi-sexual wisp of a young woman.  Body piercings are in seen and unseen places, she is covered in tattoos, has a spiked haircut, bleached eyebrows and dresses in black leather (goes with her motorcycle).  It's hard not to be distracted by this exterior, but later in the film Lisbeth takes on another identity, that of a beautiful blond rich socialite and Mara pulls that off too.

The reason the film is so noteworthy is the detail.  Set in Sweden using a mixture of European and American English speaking actors, it's hard to differentiate between native Swedes and others.  The photography is astounding.  The film jumps between urban Stockholm and a remote island, 4 hours away by train.  The film has some brutal violence, not the least of which is rape of Lisbeth by her ""guardian.""  This is tough to watch but if you appreciate revenge, just wait.  Another modification Fincher made involves the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth.  To put it bluntly they have more sex.  Their relationship is warming.  There is a real connection.  You can see Lisbeth changing.  She's feeling better about herself.  Mikael?  He's had a long romantic relationship with his publisher Erika (Robin Wright) and it appears that hasn't changed.  Lisbeth's long disappearance in the next film will make more sense.  Earlier I mentioned the opening song, I should add that Reznor and Atticus Ross wrote the music for this film and it fits the scenes perfectly.  This is a brilliant, well made movie with some outstanding performances and is at the top of my list for 2011.",1324512000,6,3828,4.802147239263804
4219458,5,B003Y5H5HO,"When American filmmakers decided to put forth a second adaptation of the Swedish vampire/drama/horror film, ""Let the Right One In"", a mere two years after the first one had been released in Sweden, I was pretty angry. Like many other geeks who'd seen the original adaptation of the Swedish novel, I thought that not enough time had passed(2 years)since the release of the first film, and that there was certainly no justification for the second adaptation. Additionally, the Swedish ""Let the Right One In"" adaptation was an unbelievably well made film(a classic in my opinion)and I believed that an attempt at an American adaptation so soon after the advent of the original film was somewhat disrespectful. ""At least allow the original film to occupy its place in the horror pantheon for at least a few years before some hack director is given permission to besmirch the legacy of the first film with his/her adaptation,"" is what I'd said to myself after becoming privy to the announcement of the new film.

After initially vowing never to see the American adaptation of ""Let the Right One In"", the relentless positive buzz that preceded the film's release date led to a change of heart. Immediately after watching the American adaptation I thought ""Wow. I am so glad that I decided to watch this movie."" The American adaptation was different from the Swedish adaptation in many ways.  In fact, the American film had some good qualities that did not exist in the Swedish version. That said, I enjoyed both movies immensely. Each movie appealed to a distinct part of my whole personality, thereby engendering a richer experience for me. Most of the professional critics would probably agree.

Fast forward to December 21, 2011, and the movie going public is faced with a similar phenomenon. In 2009, a Swedish adaptation of the Stieg Larson novel, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", was released to critical and box office acclaim in Sweden. It was then transferred to the United States for limited release.  The film became a critical and popular hit in the United States, made a star out of actress Noomi Rapace(who did a great job as the lead) and eventually made an American idol out of the novel's heroine, Lisbeth Salander. Again, a mere two years passes between the release of both films, and thankfully, the film's director is no Bret Ratner.  He is David Fincher, the brilliant auteur who has directed seminal films such as ""Seven"", ""Fight Club"", and the ""Social Network"". With Fincher's name attached to the American Adaptation, it gains instant credibility. However, lovers of the first film are still skeptical. They are afraid that the new version will not live up to the standards of the original adaptation. Well, I'm here to say that the hand wringers can rest easy.  David Fincher's version of  ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is just as good, if not better, than the Swedish original.

Many of you who are reading this review are familiar with Stieg Larson's novel. It features a character named Lisbeth Salander, a 24 year old genius computer hacker whose life has been made very difficult because of the psychological/sexual/physical abuse that has been put upon her by male authority figures. Because of this abuse, Lisbeth comes to despise men. That is until she comes into contact with disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, with whom she teams up with to solve the 40 year old ""murder"" of Harriet Vagner, a relative of wealthy businessman, Henrik Vagner. As they investigate the disappearance of Harriet, Lisbeth and Mikael become involved in a sexual relationship, where upon Lisbeth develops feelings for the rakish reporter.  They are able to solve the case together even as  the relationship between Mikael and Lisbeth becomes complicated.

All of the actors do well for themselves in this movie adaptation, especially actress Rooney Mara, who really gives her all as Lisbeth. Noomi Rapace was great as Lisbeth in the Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo"". However, Rooney Mara's physical and psychological interpretation of the damaged Lisbeth really grabs you. Anyone who has read the book will tell you that Rooney Mara's Lisbeth fits more with their idealized image of Lisbeth; an emaciated, pale, sexy, and sometimes androgynous girl/woman with a really nasty streak if provoked. Rooney has already been nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance, and is predicted to get more attention during the upcoming awards season.  Daniel Graig is solid as Mikael Blomkvist, and Stellen Skarsgard gives a scary, creepy performance as Martin Vanger. Oh, and special kudos to Yorick Van Waginengen, whose performance as Bjurman(Lisbeth's abusive social worker) really makes you despise his character. You will rejoice when he receives his comeuppance in a brutal scene.

David Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" moves much quicker than the Swedish version, even though the film runs almost 3 hours. Everything about Fincher's film is leaner/edgier than the previous version: the lead characters are younger and nastier, the editing is quicker, and the dialog is sharper.  Much more of Stieg Larson's story is told in David Fincher's movie than in the previous version; and this allows the director to really develop the relationship between Lisbeth and Mikael. I also like the tone of this movie. It's a dark, cold and gray movie. I don't think that the sun ever shines in one scene, and given the subject matter of the film(female rape and murder)it would be wrong for the movie to be filmed in any other way besides the dark and gray.

So go watch this movie. You'll be sufficiently transfixed by it. And if you haven't seen the Swedish version of the film, watch that too.  They are both wonderful movies, and the positive critical reception is nearly identical for both movies as well. A warning though. If you have not seen the first movie or read the books, prepare yourself for some disturbing content.",1324425600,694,5973,4.993963782696177
4219459,5,B003Y5H5HO,"A disgraced financial journalist, and a young antisocial computer hacker join forces to solve the 40 year old mystery of a teenage girl's disappearance.  As they do so, they get drawn into serious crime and corruption, deadly family secrets, and a string of unsolved murders of young women spanning fifty years, which puts their own lives at unbelievable risk.  Will they solve the mystery before they become history?

When I saw the original movie series about two years ago,  I was awestruck by mostly the awesome acting of Noomi rapace, and the movie's visual style, and it's inherent raunchiness, which is more common in stylish European thrillers than slick Hollywood movies.  When I heard there would be an English version,  I thought this would be a hard act to follow, and without Noomi Rapace as the female lead would not be the same, because she was so much an integral element of the original movies success.

In the meantime I listened to the audiobook version featuring Simon Vance, available on Amazon owned audible.com, which I also found quite enjoyable.  He does all the voices including Lisbeth with a slight Swedish accent that veers toward cockney. The story is much more detailed with many elements glossed over or left out of the original movie.

So, when I heard it was about to be released, and saw the trailer, and understood the pedigree behind this movie with David Fincher directing, and Daniel Craig as Blomquist,  I made a point of going to the evening show before its official opening today.

Inevitably, one cannot help but compare with the previous experience.  Definitely, the fact that this is in English is the greatest justification for the remake, so for many people who are distracted by subtitles this will automatically be a better experience.

Steven Zaillian, the screenwriter, previously won an Oscar for writing Schindlers List.  From a storytelling point of view, it stays close to the original story, with much more detail, in that respect exceeding the original.  In other respects too it exceeds the original. I particularly liked for example the soundtrack with its darker gothic metal tones by Trent Reznor, and the opening somewhat James Bond style imagery although darker, and I loved the storytelling.

This movie completes the full arc of the story, whereas I felt unclear in the original about the full circle story against Wennerstrom.  This movie introduces the cat, and Cecilia Vanger as a character.  We get to meet some of the characters we don't meet in the original.

David Fincher goes to great lengths not to have it be a remake, having each scene be somewhat different.  This movie is also raunchier, you'll know what I mean when you see it and focuses more on the relationship between Blomquist and Salander.  It also has occasional humor. The scene where Michael is hunted shocked me in my seat, and there are several shocking scenes in the movie, including the crime against Lisabeth by her guardian.  This is a harrowing scene as is the basement scene, although I felt that particular one was more harrowing in the original.

Perhaps the single best thing about this version is that it captures the intention of the original author.  Apparently, when Stieg Larson was a teenager he witnessed a gang rape of a teenage girl, and did not intervene to stop it.  He was always troubled by this,  second guessing his behavior, and worked as an independent investigative journalist, and this was partly his motivation for writing the Millenium Trilogy series which has now reportedly sold over 60 million copies, and the great visual art of 4 movies.  In fact, he gave the character Lisbeth the same first name as the original victim, so when Blomquist proposes to Lisbeth that she help him find a killer of women, one senses that Larson would be very pleased about this.

With Lisbeth Salander he has crafted one of the most memorable female characters I have experienced onscreen, and a type of character we don't see enough in Hollywood movies, the strong female protagonist.  This type of character you will see in European movies.  Recent examples worth checking out would be&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Debt/dp/B006INDMEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Debt</a>with Jessica Chastain and Helen Mirren,  and the miraculous survival abilities of Carice Van Houten in Verhoeven's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Book/dp/B000TGCR38/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Book</a>, which I own.

There is a revenge and justice theme that permeates the series, which gets more explored later in the trilogy. Lisbeth comes more into her own in the second movie, and even though the Academy does not usually look to the thriller genre for nominations, there may be an Oscar nomination for Rooney Mara in the The Girl who played with Fire.

I liked also seeing Robin Wright as Blomquists partner, and while I still give the original movie the cool points for style and the visuals, I think many people will without my preconceptions warm to Rooney Mara who does give a great performance, in her unique way as this antisocial yet extremely resourceful  and intelligent computer hacker.

I recommend it whether or not you have seen the original series.  I also recommend you do check out the original series.  If you are an Amazon Prime member, as I write you can watch the original series for free on Amazon video.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-With-the-Dragon-Tattoo-English-subtitled/dp/B003TTWJJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (English subtitled)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Played-With-Fire-English-subtitled/dp/B003Z9SYFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Played With Fire (English subtitled)</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-Who-Kicked-The-Hornet-s-Nest/dp/B0046H0HZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest</a>.

If they do complete the rest of the trilogy, there will be opportunities in those movies to vastly outshine the originals, certainly if they include more detail from the books as they do here.  I think you will love it, and I hope this review was helpful.",1324425600,6,6354,5.572320499479709
4219460,5,B003Y5H5HO,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has a rather large fan following and for good reason. The 2009 Swedish film is incredibly solid and well-acted with just the right amount of wrong. The two sequels that followed had their own uphill battles (switching directors, lower budget, etc) and weren't necessarily bad, but just failed to capture that raw emotional tenacity the original film offered. When news of a remake began making the usual rounds, there was a fairly large uproar amongst the internet community (isn't there always?), especially when it was announced Noomi Rapace wouldn't be returning as Lisbeth Salander. Most American remakes aren't directed by David Fincher though and while it isn't vastly different in comparison to its Swedish counterpart, Fincher has at least improved upon what was already a fantastic piece of cinema.

The opening of the film was a bit unexpected. ""The Immigrant Song"" cover by Trent Reznor and Karen O plays over these really fluid visuals that are a bit hard to describe. Imagine the T-1000 from Terminator 2 made of motor oil or tar instead of metal and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It was just very different from other film credits from the rest of the year while also being very sleek, very stylish, and very David Fincher.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is extremely dialogue driven, so be prepared for a lot of talking. It feels very similar to Zodiac in that sense yet more captivating. Even though I had seen the original film and knew most of the major plot points, I still found myself getting sucked into the story. Even if you hate this version of the film and your loyalty remains firmly with the Swedish film, you can probably at least agree that Fincher's version is visually the better of the two. The cinematography is just brilliant. You've gotten teases in the trailers, but the coldest winter in 20 years for Sweden looks so bloody fantastic on screen; the amazing scenery, those long drives through the snow, feeling like you're on the back of Lisbeth's motorcycle as she roars through a tunnel, and the inner shot of a plastic bag among many other things. The film is just a joy to look at from beginning to end.

The score is also just as brilliant as the one for The Social Network, if not slightly better. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seem to explore territory they didn't get to explore on The Social Network score. This one seems to feature more out of tune instruments, which is an interesting touch. The score hints at rising tension throughout the film always making you feel like there's always something else to the story lurking around the corner waiting for the right moment to strike. It's haunting, unnerving, and just spectacular overall.

Noomi Rapace was an exceptional Lisbeth Salander and with that said so is Rooney Mara. Just the amount of devotion she put into the role with the piercings being genuine, bleaching her eyebrows, cutting her hair, learning how to ride a motorcycle, using a very convincing Swedish accent, coming off as being just as messed up as her appearance lets on, and being completely nude is an incredible accomplishment. It's not out of the question to believe that a role this physical could get her nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards. The entire cast just seems like they fit their roles a bit better than they did in the Swedish film. This is one of the only performances of Daniel Craig's I can actually say I enjoyed while Stellan Skarsgrd is just wonderfully demented. Then there's Yorick van Wageningen that's just downright despicable as Nils Bjurman. It doesn't seem like it's something as simple as ""oh, you're showing favoritism towards a remake because it's in English now."" That isn't the case at all. Fincher's attention to detail to the source material is practically Kubrick-like. It shows in every frame of the film.

Fincher's version also seems to feature a lot more of Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander being together. They have more sex and they're featured together more on-screen in comparison to the Swedish version. It was a nice addition that made the slightly altered ending a lot more impactful. The whistling doors in Martin's house were also amazing. I can't recall if that was in the Swedish version or not, but it brought a smile to my face with how something so small meant so much.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is obviously not going to be for everybody. It relies on extremely long discussions to drive most of the two and a half hour duration of the film. In between though, it becomes difficult to watch mostly with how Nils Bjurman handles giving Lisbeth more money and her response. Lisbeth's response will more than likely have you tiptoeing out of the theater as delicately as possible since you'll still be feeling it. With a phenomenal cast, incredibly rich cinematography, a brilliant score, and Rooney Mara's best performance to date, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is not only an improvement over the original but easily one of the best films of the year.",1323734400,230,5054,4.790137614678899

I saw the original version 8 years ago and thought there was no way an American re-make could possibly be as good but amazingly it is. Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are fantastic and perfectly cast. It perfectly captures the chill of both the setting and the characters in it.

4219651,4,B003Y5H5HO,"It puzzles me at times how American filmmakers conceive their projects. Far too often these days the products bubbling out of Hollywood lots are totally devoid of originality, relying on comic books, old stories, and sequels to conveniently ride upon the coattails of the initial version. We might refer to this as The Rocky syndrome--one film does well, so let's make six. Steig Larson's amazing international best-selling Millennium trilogy was originally produced as an exceptional six-part mini-series. Noomi Rapace WAS Lisbeth Salander. No one could have portrayed The Girl better.

Why do I then give this remake/cover of a finer film four stars? I did, I must admit, hesitate and cogitate upon that rating and simply rounded up. Daniel Crag and Rooney Mara brought their characters together just well enough to warrant three and a half. The direction was excellent and the script well paced, building enough intensity to keep viewers engaged and guessing. The mind loves a mystery.

However, the American version felt to much like a Seiko watch made to resemble a Rolex. Looks okay, but everyone knows it's a knock-off.",1519948800,,1126,5.147540983606557

That's not the only reason I stopped watching it. I found that I cared more for the search of the missing girl in question in the David Fincher remake because of the set up and dialog used. There are some disturbing scenes in it like the original (the book was also lurid to I've heard) but the movie gets intense towards the end which makes it one of the best movies I've seen.

4219690,3,B003Y5H5HO,"I prefer the Swedish visual interpretations of Lisbeth Salander. Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig did the best with what they had and kept the movie from being a total flop imo. The bleached eyebrows are a negative for me because Lisbeth is pretty down to Earth. Bleached eyebrows are a little bourgeois for a true goth/grunge cyber hacker. I also feel the Trent Reznor soundtrack was trendy, although I like it. I am a NIN fan so that's obvious bias there. Even as a NIN fan I thought Plague wearing a NIN tee was a shameless plug that cheapened the vibe of the movie.

I have to blame the director for making Lisbeth 's character so unnatural and intentionally awkward. I can't stop watching the Swedish movies over and over again, edited and extended version wise. I caught myself totally ignoring this movie though. I think I forgot it was on and went to make dinner once.

I watched some behind the scenes footage about Rooney Mara creating Lisbeths character. Ultimately I feel like there was too much responsibility placed on her to do so. Lisbeth's character is open to various interpretations due to her upbringing. Rooney showed anger, where Noomi showed pain and both are fairly accurate IMO. Ultimately this director didn't add enough depth to either Mikael or Lisbeths characters and certain points wouldn't have been caught if someone hadn't read the book prior to watching the movie. It was very forced and nothing felt natural.

I don't like the casting of the supporting characters either. Miriam Wu, nor Erika have enough charm to add to the movie. It's hard to imagine that the eccentric main characters would have deep relationships with them. I think ultimately, that falls on the director again since it's the directors job to bring the spark out of people to the big screen.

Maybe we'll get another American version in the future. I hope so because this didn't do it for me, and I know that the actors and actresses are totally capable of delivering captivating performances in other movies.",1514592000,,2011,4.786743515850144

4219773,5,B003Y5H5HO,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a 2011 murder mystery and thriller from Columbia Pictures, which is the American film adaptation of the novel by the same name, that was written by the acclaimed Swedish journalist and author, the late Stieg Larsson. Its story line centers around the investigation of the mysterious disappearance of a sixteen-year-old Swedish girl over forty years earlier. Despite a lengthy and exhaustive search, the girl was never found, after having been discovered missing from the family estate, with no apparent explanation for her disappearance. This investigation is initiated by her great uncle, who is a prominent Swedish industrialist, and who is the patriarch of one of Swedens wealthiest and most influential families. He consults a renowned Swedish investigative journalist to lead the inquiry into this unsolved disappearance of his grandniece, whom he has always suspected was murdered by someone in their family. This veteran journalist subsequently partners with an eccentric punk computer genius and hacker, whose tremendous digital expertise greatly facilitates his investigation, and ultimately enables him to solve this very perplexing case. The performances of the lead actors, Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig, are absolutely outstanding, as are the performances of the members of the talented supporting cast. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a decidedly intriguing, suspenseful, and captivating murder mystery and thriller, and I found it to be extremely engaging and entertaining. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo features superb plot and character development, as well as great acting performances, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1506988800,7,1731,5.6106870229007635

I only gave it a four star rating because I felt the movie drag in only a few spots plus the supporting cast members, what saved the movie in my view was how powerful the acting job was for Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig.  I also thought was of the physical scenes where a bit much, so don't watch if you can't handle violent scenes towards women, but if you love a good mystery thriller movie that makes your mind go where is this leading to or toward then buy this movie.  In closing that was what made the movie for me was trying to figure out the mystery before the end of the movie plus fact big fan of the director and enjoy Craig in his 007 movies, so if you love that type of movie keeping you on the edge of seat mystery thriller then buy this and savor it for yourself but be warn of violence toward women scenes not for faint of heart.",1500595200,,1197,4.080851063829787

TITLE: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)  R  2:38:09
  Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Robin Wright
  David Fincher (Director)

  This is one of my favorites movies from among those that were made within the last ten years; and, it does fairly well on my all-time list, too. The reason I regard this film so highly, is because it is a THINKING person's movie! If you want a mindless plot, lots of explosions and plenty of gratuitous nudity (though, there are an isolated few naked bodies on display), then this movie is NOT (repeat, NOT) for you. However, if you want to be mentally stimulated, visually enthralled, and aurally caressed, then this is, very probably, a movie for you. Also, did I mention that it was directed by David Fincher? David Fincher is one of the four directors (Ridley Scott, James Cameron and Woody Allen [go figure], being the other three), that no matter what the subject is, and no matter who the stars are, if they make it, I want to see it (and, VERY probably, own it)! This movie is a VERY fine example of why that is so.

  One last note to the more sensitive souls among you: this movie DEFINITELY earns its R rating. Without, hopefully, giving away too much, this movie does contain a limited number of scenes (from both a violence and sexual aspect) that some may find VERY unsettling  there aren't many, but, they are INTENSE. Consider yourself forewarned.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 2.40:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (32.4 Mbps)

  The movie's image, from a purely aesthetic perspective, is absolutely GORGEOUS  even the treatment of the opening Columbia Studios logo is a wonder to behold. Now, from a much more technical perspective: it's still pretty darn good! It is very sharp (without any obvious edge-enhancement). It has very good contrast and very good shadow detail (as seen in the dark and shadowy areas, such as in all of the night scenes, and in the dark scenes located in the interior of the main Vanger house near the beginning of the movie, and in the alley outside of the magazine's offices close to the end of the movie). And, it has richly saturated, though muted, colors  that are, very much in keeping with the dark tone and feeling of the movie's plot. Also, fine detail is readily apparent throughout the movie; with the textures of faces, clothing and other surfaces being particularly good. Lastly, there are no obvious artifacts such as banding, specks, white dots, hair-lines or color fluctuations to be seen. Overall, this movie's presentation on blu-ray has AMAZING picture quality, and should satisfy all but the VERY pickiest viewers.

AUDIO: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1

  The sonic presentation of this movie is a LOT like its visual presentation: at first blush, not much going on. However, upon closer inspection, it is a richly rewarding, sonorous experience. The sound quality of the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack for this disc, doesn't overwhelm you with bluster (not mostly, anyway); rather, it seduces you with understated finely rendered details and delicately nuanced textures  in other words, while it doesn't necessarily scream at you, it still sounds REALLY good. The dialog is clear and well placed, and the rear and side channels (I used Dolby PLIIx while listening) are quite active and very directional; utilizing subtle environmental sounds and music to give me that deeply moving 'you-are-there' feeling that I frequently get when listening to movies with reference-quality soundtracks (but, without all of the explosions and much of the house rattling bass that they possess [which is why this movie gets 'only' a 4.5 for sound quality, and not a 5.0]). Don't get me wrong: this soundtrack is an excellent example of the craftsmanship that goes into top-flight sound design, but it is more of a tap on the shoulder, than a slap in the face! Still, all but the VERY pickiest listeners will be satisfied.

4220244,4,B003Y5H5HO,"Big fan of the trilogy.  I saw all the original Swedish films too.  While I truly appreciate how the original films stayed true to the story details, this American version did a great job of condensing without loosing key elements of the plot. IF you ignore how they minimize the lesbian relationship that is really a huge part of Lisbeth Sander's persona. I'm interested to see how they will handle it in the second film, as it becomes even more intertwined in the plot. (if they ever end up making a part two or three)",1479168000,,520,4.463157894736842

Hide their secrets, a brilliant journalist, a troubled hacker.

Out of these elements is made a beautiful film. You may call me perverse, certainly

4220505,5,B003Y5H5HO,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo

 The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo has people surging into theaters around the country.  I hope none of them are faint hearted.  There are some of the most intense, graphic scenes of human depravity ever put on film in this very fine movie.  The R rating is well and truly earned.  If realistic sex, brutal rape and foul murder are more than you can take, stay far far away.
 That warning over, this very long-two hours and 40 minutes-film is as good as we are likely to get in this flawed, fallen world.  We are taken through the twists and turns on the way to discovering the solution to a decades old mystery, the disappearance of a teen age girl from the midst of her extended family.  What might have been just a superbly told tale of horror and mystery is enlivened and elevated by the amazing characters invented by Swedish author, Stieg Larsson, now tragically for book and movie lovers, deceased.  The forces of good are represented by a magazine publisher, now disgraced, and his assistant, a tattooed and pierced 23 year old with a photographic memory who might really be insane.  She certainly is one of the most unconventional heroines in all of literature.  On the other side we have someone who has perhaps been successful in killing a string of young women.
 Daniel Craig, lately appearing as the most successful James Bond since the sainted Sean Connery, plays the magazine publisher.  He leaves his well muscled body in the closet and seems more realistically like a middle aged, not so fit desk jockey.  He is hired to investigate the very cold case of the missing teen ager.  Christopher Plummer very grandly plays the elderly Swedish magnate who hires the investigator.  But the amazing Rooney Mara steals the show as the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  Very rarely does an actress have the courage to throw herself into a role so completely.  I thought at first that she was a newbie, maybe from Latvia or something.  But no, she is American and not new, this is her seventh big screen appearance since 2009.  She is startling, at one moment tragically vulnerable at the next, composed and ruthless.  It is transformational acting.
 Writer/producer Steven Zaillian takes a terrific novel and translates to the screen successfully.  He is responsible for such other successful movies as Money Ball and American Gangster, both of which I reviewed favorably.  Director David Fincher filmed much of this bleak tale in the bleak winter of Sweden, making the whole enterprise even bleaker, quite appropriately.  He also directed the recent Social Network and the thrillers Fight Club and Seven.  This first rate movie had the benefit of a first rate script with excellent directing and good performances by fine actors.  This is how four saw blade movies get made.  It would be five saw blades, a rare bird indeed, except that I thought some trimming might have improved things.  It is two hours and forty minutes after all.
 They spent an astonishing $90 million to make the film, which seems a lot but is justified by its take thus far of $140 million in worldwide ticket sales.  Fans who can take the intense realism can look forward to at least two more films.  Larsson wrote three novels with the same characters before his untimely passing.",1471132800,2,3291,4.768141592920354

If you are odd like me, i prefer the English version for the simple fact that its A really well done,B the main girl is amazing looking and C i speak English. So i watch the first one from America and the second two from Sweden uncut.  Is it mixed up and confused, yes, but at least i get some of my cake and I somewhat get to eat it too.

The second problem with the movie is that it follows a little too closely to the book.  The ending should have been cut and i often stop watching it when they are laying on the bed together at the very end and not the epilogue of Eliza going to make all her money.  which is interesting but also boring.

The acting, lighting and general feel of the movie is spot on and looks simply better then the Swedish one.  but again who can argue with the completed work over the half finished one.",1470182400,,970,4.1005291005291005

I wouldn't try comparing book to movie as the movie always ends up trumping any cinema feature, but as far as adaptions go, this one is impressively accurate. A few details were mucked up, however it didn't take away from the plotline or come together in the end in a rough manner. You will be shocked by this movie, horrified, and potentially have a need to put on a leather jacket and solve a murder. Lisbeth Salander is 10/10, and this is an entirely new side of Daniel Craig's acting that is sadly swept under the Bond films. I encourage a trip into The Girl with the Dragon tattoo, but prepare yourself to set back on your heels and then put on the edge of your seat.

Seeing this getting a Hollywood remake definitely peaked my interest but the real reason I went to watch this on opening night and bought the blu ray as soon as it came out can be summed up in a name. David Fincher.

I definitely thought it was a weird follow up to ""The Social Network"", but this movie is actually more fitted to the style he's known for in ""Se7en"", ""Zodiac"", ""The Game"", and more recently ""Gone Girl."" As always this man delivers clinical precision in his direction. Whether you like the movie is always subjective but I can definitely recommend for fans of Fincher or thrillers in general.

The product itself follows the more premium sort of box packaging Fincher has been using for his releases since ""The Social Network."" The same packaging you can find in ""Gone Girl"" and the ""House of Cards"" series. It feels like a very premium product, which includes the movie on blu ray and dvd and a second blu ray disc with all the extras (a lot).",1468627200,3,1139,4.471153846153846

Although watching a film with subtitles is cumbersome, I must honestly say I consider the Swedish version superior. Both actresses that portray Lisbeth do an excellent job, but I think the Swedish actress is a bit better. Sorry, I forgot her name. The english version is a little bit slicker. Prettier actresses and actors, lusher sets and newer cars, but the Swedish version has a  more realistic look and feel  in the sense that actual everyday people don't have hollywood star looks. If anyone is interested I would highly recommend the Millennium trilogy extended edition. I've watch the short version and the extended edition and enjoyed them both. The extended edition gives you more information and helps explain a lot of things that I found confusing at first. Another  thing that annoyed me  about the American version was the musical sound track played almost constantly and made hard for my 71 year old ears to understand the dialog.",1466294400,,1016,4.923976608187134

All the horrible ""bits"" are here, but they were in the book, so they have to be here.  The horrid bits are impetus to the conclusion and I absolutely loved the conclusion.
The actors, including Craig, are great.  And if you have read the books you know who the bad guy is.  There are a few minor plot changes, but those are ok, I think it had more to do with time than anything else.

4220735,3,B003Y5H5HO,"Having first read the book, I was disappointed in this American production. Some major plot points are missing and others are completely made up by the American screenwriter. I was extremely impressed by actress Rooney Mara. I like Daniel Craig as an actor in other films but I thought he had no spark whatsoever in this movie. His performance is completely forgettable.

I'm buying the Swedish versions of all three films that have English subtitles. I hope I'll be more pleased with those; but I wonder who translated the Swedish into English. I loved reading all three of Stieg Larsson's books; each book is amazing, even translated into English by Steven Murray (aka Reg Keeland) who has gone on record saying that the British publishers (and thus the American publishers) deviated from his translation so much that he didn't want his real name on the books as the translator. Sigh!  I wish I could read Swedish.

If you have only seen the movie and have not read the book, you might think it was a great movie. I won't argue with anyone about that but I highly recommend the book rather than the movie.",1465948800,,1107,4.695876288659794

Performances like that don't occur often and they're things to be cherished. David Fincher's style and aesthetic replicate the tone of the film's source material better than the Swedish adaptation. I think this is also the more faithful adaptation. It's not a movie to be watched casually though. Most people I've shown it to are, rightly, disturbed and off put by its lengthy and graphic rape scene. People have called it over the top, and I don't disagree with them but, it is faithful to the source material and relevant to the point of the film. Watch it twice, you'll enjoy it that much more, and it's certainly worth it to.

4220863,3,B003Y5H5HO,"When I first heard that there would be an American remake of this film, I assumed that they would rewrite it so that it would take place in America. So I was rather surprised that it wasn't the case. Which begs the question, why remake it at all? Why not just make the original more available over here? Are American audiences really that stuck up and adverse to subtitled foreign films that we feel we have to remake every good movie from overseas? I was already starting to dread renting this as the rock music video style opening credits rolled, luckily it wasn't as bad as the first impression they left me with indicated. The major difference here lies in the tattoo itself. The dragon that once took up an entire back, has been shrunk down to fit a shoulder, and they shrunk down the character of Lisbeth right along with it. They made her softer, more likable, and attractive. which is not Lisbeth at all. For example the mugging scene, in the original, Lisbeth goes all bat-$#!* crazy on those guys, but not this time. In the original, Lisbeth was portrayed as cold, emotionally disconnected and unavailable, even with people she is having sexual relations with. Certainly not someone who would crush on an older man in a heartbeat as we see here. True film enthusiasts know where the real deal is at, and it is not with this version.",1462579200,,1342,4.572614107883817

4220892,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I have watched both the American and Swedish versions of this great work.  I highly recommend watching both.  First, I believe that this version, directed by David Fincher is superior.  What makes it better is that it is unflinching and it does not ""play down"" to the audience.  The things that happen to Lisbeth are real and evil.  What she decides to do about it are equally brutal.  However, they are key to understanding her.  I felt that the ""key event"" in the Swedish version was too hurried and superficial.  By contrast, David Fincher ""takes us there"" and the aftermath where Lisbeth tries to ""wash it all off"" is painful and excruciating to watch.  We don't have this kind of impact in the original version and this is important to note because these moments are central to the whole story line in the remaining two films.  These events tell us that Lisbeth accepts that evil happens and that she is resolute in not being a victim.  Lisbeth is a smart survivor and finds that her justice is a dish ""best served cold.""

I also prefer the atmosphere if this version over the original.  It is dark, misty and otherworldly. Yet, the cabin where Lisbeth and Mikael work is a white-washed, almost shabby chic refuge.  It's the perfect mood and setting for a mystery.  This is a very intelligent who-dunnit.  I really like the chemistry between Lisbeth's logical genius and Mikael's passion for the truth.  They are a very odd pair. But, it works brilliantly.

The performances in both versions are absolutely stellar.  I recommend watching Fincher's film first.  Then watch the original series.  A very smart, suspenseful and unpredictable work.",1460332800,,1648,4.814285714285714

The film consists in large part of difficult-to-dramatize scenes of smart people thinking and carrying out researching. Fincher's desaturated, omniscient camera make this enthralling. Craig and Mara are excellent. The depiction of the world is so engrossing, I actually find it encourages me toward productivity; cool characters doing work somehow makes me want to...work? Strange but true.

I would encourage sceptical lovers of Noomi Rapace to set aside their admiration and give this version a try. I think both versions can happily coexist, even if I happen to prefer this one.",1455235200,2,767,5.278688524590164

4221116,5,B003Y5H5HO,"DVD transfer is crisp and clean.  Excellent.

It's rare that we get a mystery film with such a multi-themed plot.  Not only is there a great secret to be uncovered but the characters must deal with their own demons.  Daniel Craig wonderfully underplays his part as a disgraced investigative journalist hired to pry into family secrets to uncover a murderer.  Rooney Mara is astonishing as the techie youth who must deal with not only her own sexual ambiguity but the sexual perversions and brutality of those who have power over her.  These two must come together and seek a mutual cooperation to solve the mystery.  It seems as if each of the two are trying to escape their own realities by finding this murderer.

It would be a shame to reveal plot details here.  Rather, I would want the viewers to feel the story for themselves.  It is an engrossing film with fine direction and excellent production values.  Naomi Rapace had the original career-launching role and Rooney Mara is just as good if not better in this version.

Recommended for those over 17 only.  This film has a very frank sexual tone and it is not appropriate for young viewers at all.  If you like mysteries, you will love 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'.  For adults, this is a must see movie.  Highly recommended to that audience.",1454889600,5,1306,4.662280701754386

4221352,4,B003Y5H5HO,This movie was quite the psychological thriller. Had some violent scenes that maybe showed a bit too much but had a great plot with lots of twists and turns.

4221435,5,B003Y5H5HO,I read the books and thought they were terrific. I thought the movie was very good.  It was a complicated plot so it was a difficult challenge putting together a movie that was worthy of the books.  Unless you read the books first the plot of the movie may have been difficult to follow.  I haven't heard anything about additional movies.  I hope to see book two and three in the movies.  It's a real shame the author died not too long after the books were published.,1448409600,,467,4.32183908045977

4221442,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I have read the trilogy and have seen the Swedish movie version several times. The books are excellent and the movie is very good. This version with Daniel Craig is also very good. The script and actors provide a bit different perspective on the main characters than the Swedish movie trilogy and I was curious how the writers would have extended this in their version of the next two books. Unfortunately, these movies are apparently not going to happen. However, a movie based on the most recent Lisbeth Salander is apparently in the works.

Both movie versions necessarily present a much shallower character development and background than the books. This American version seems to do a better job, but I highly recommend reading the books to get a more complete perspective..",1447718400,2,779,4.9465648854961835

In no way was the disc sent to me a genuine, legal copy (i.e. there was no label on the disc itself, someone had written in black magic marker on the disc the title and the cardboard folder it came in was bogus too---a pirated copy sold as a genuine new DVD of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I notified amazon.com's customer service immediately--it was reported and I was told amazon would launch an investigation immediately, that they would remove the listing of this DVD sold from amazon fulfillment services, and I was given a full refund.

The evil and darkness in this US (2011) version is relentless, yet life is not that way.  The humor in the Swedish version not only gives temporary  relief from evil, the evil becomes more impactful.  The viewer does not become numb to it.

Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer -- everyone's acting is so top notch; the direction is also incredibly cinematic and dramatizes even quiet moments for maximum emotional tension; the editing is paced so well, never a dull moment but with lots of variations from quiet, slow scenes to quick, action scenes.

And what did I dislike specifically? Mikael Blomkvist is played by Daniel Craig and Lisbeth Salander is played by Rooney Mara. I presume the director, David Fincher, requested that Mara act vulnerable. I doubt that Daniel Craig could conceivably play a feminist man like Blomkvist.  Basically this film is a typical Hollywood film -- manly men and feminine women interacting with each other.  Not so in the novels or the Swedish film: there Lisbeth is a wholly original character, a goth hacker girl who is afraid of nothing.  Changing this character to a girl who is vulnerable ruins what was great about the novels. Maybe some people will like this film.

4221932,4,B003Y5H5HO,"The story is good, but the screenplay seemed a lot like a radio drama: there were several instances where the dialogue was simply an explanation of what was going on onscreen as if the audience wasn't smart enough to understand what they were seeing.

All that said, it wasn't a bad movie, the actors were good, and the cenimatography was good.  It is just disappointing if you have seen the Swedish version of the film which seemed to be better on all counts, better acting, better cenimatography, better directing and a better screenplay.  Unless you cannot stand reading subtitles and don't know Swedish, you should watch that version, otherwise watch the American remake.

I am a fan of Daniel Craig and think he's a phenomenal actor and does a great job in this film, but compared to the Swedish movie he doesn't quite stand up.",1439596800,,833,4.724137931034483

I just received this DVD yesterday and it came in pretty rough condition. The case that holds the DVD is damaged and information printed on the back is just a piece of paper that is adhered in only one spot and is crooked.
As for the DVD itself, it had a ""sticker"" stuck to the side and bottom, which makes me worried it now won't play correctly because the sticky stuff is still attached.

I don't like Rooney Mara very much but I didn't like the character of Lisbeth in the book either.  The only thing I would say is I'm not sure she needed to be quite so unattractive.  And she's why I gave the movie four stars instead of five.  All in all, they did a fantastic job of translating the book to screen.

Sickening. I hate modern Hollywood where everything has either Dracular gloom or dust cloud envelope all-about, Hey this is 2015; 1970 westerns have better color than Hollywood movies today.

However, it was also very difficult to watch due to the level of violence/abuse shown in this movie. I was actually shocked at how much was shown. I am pretty sensitive to displays of violence so the images just kind of stuck with me. I would suggest skipping this movie if you are the sensitive type.",1428624000,,394,4.486111111111111

Great cast, great storytelling, great locations, great action. I'm a fan of Daniel Craig as James Bond and Christopher Plummer is always a fav.

The Swedish version did a few things better (kind of prefer Noomi Rapace over Rooney Mara for the role of Lisbeth Salander, but both do a great job).",1428105600,,443,4.67948717948718

4222565,4,B003Y5H5HO,I'm a big Daniel Craig fan so I really enjoyed this movie.  But what impressed me more was Amazon.  I rented the movie to stream but experience several interruptions while watching the movie.  I thought it was my wifi and gave it no thought.  A couple of days later I received an email from Amazon indicating that their records showed that my viewing experience was not acceptable to their standards and that they were issuing me a refund.  Service like that will have me renew my Prime subscription for another year.  Thank you Amazon.,1427932800,,536,4.648936170212766

I am shocked at the popularity of this movie and generally positive reviews. The rapist doctor should have lost his credentials and put in jail for the atrocious act he committed. Instead, his ""victim"" re-anally rapes him with a plastic penis, re-blackmails him but then prevents him from having any intimate contact with women in the future (even consensual) and then goes on to tattoo his chest which makes it impossible for him to ever take off his shirt or even go to a doctor for a medical issue. One evil act does not make a worse evil act not-evil, yet the audience is supposed to cheer? The movie is so over-the-top and unrealistic the only legs it has to stand on are shock-value and revenge.

I later read the author was a radical leftist communist, which I suppose explains his mindset somewhat but I would in no way recommend this film to anyone, let alone young adults.",1420416000,3,991,4.5363128491620115

Stellan Skarsgard seems to have been born for evil movie roles. Serious cast and acting. Most importantly, I love the mysteriously dark mood that David Fincher managed to create, which is a perfect reflection of the novel's mood. I haven't seen the 2009 version, but I'm not sure now I want to. This movie is rocking' cool. One of the best movies I've ever seen. Great job Mr. Fincher! As for Rooney Mara, this young actress transformed herself beyond recognition just for the role of Salander, such a devoted portrayal of the main character it's almost unreal. Wonderful acting.

4223263,5,B003Y5H5HO,"you can say what you want about the american version. There is always controversy when going from book to movie. It is true like many others this movie does not follow the book exactly, I think they played it safe knowing they would only make one movie so the studio decided to end things a little differently but it was a pre cursor that definitely got me interested enough to buy in sit through the Swedish version (saga) and all its subtitles. Great story to dive into and if you're like me, it left you hungry for more which leads you to search for the sequels, the girl who played with fire and the girl who shook the hornets nest. Fortunately if you wind up liking the franchise,  the Swedes give you a lot more footage as they didn't seem to have an agenda that wouldnt last any more than 120 min because that would mean ultimately you can't fill the 9:00 seat when you've already filled the one for the 7.",1419379200,,913,4.308139534883721

""The Wizard of Oz"", ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", ""Cat Ballou"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Mary Poppins"", ""Dr. Zhivago"", ""Patton"", ""The Godfather"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Jaws"", ""All the President's Men"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Shining"", ""Stand By Me"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", ""Out of Africa"", ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo"".

4223425,4,B003Y5H5HO,"This Anglicized version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is very well done.  The acting, script, photography, direction are excellent.  But--and here is the rub: why was it made?  The original was so well done that I just don't quite get it.  The acting, script, direction, photography, etc were absolutely top-notch in the original as well.  The answer, of course, must boil down to this:  people don't like to read subtitles or watch foreign films with English dubbed in.  Which is understandable, but a shame, really.  So I cannot fault this remake except to say that it seems so redundant anad almost pointless.  And for me, what it comes down to is this:  if I had to choose between the original and this clone, which would I choose?  I suppose my answer by now is obvious:  the original version simply has an edge in virtually every category.  Noomi Rapace perfectly created/interpreted the character of Lisbeth Salander as does Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist, the intrepid reporter.  Again, Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig also did excellent work in their corresponding roles as well. So it comes down to this for me: the remake seems utterly pointless in spite of the fact that it covers exactly the same ground in almost exactly the same way, etc with excellent acting as well.

This remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is not to scoffed at, however, unless, of course, you don't like the book or the basic script of the original source materials, etc, and it serves well those who despise reading subtitles (and there are many that do) and want to see their films in English.  Is it worth seeing?  Absolutely and I can highly recommend it.  It is very well done.  But, in my opinion, lacks a certain fire that the original Swedish version had.  The only thing is, if you've already seen the Swedish version and then watch the remake, all of the surprises of the original will have been eliminated, which is what most of the joy of this film was about in the first place.",1417910400,,1990,4.64756446991404

4223748,1,B003Y5H5HO,"I've been re-reading the 3 book series. What fantastic books!
Thought I'd check out the movie to see how they did.
They did bad.
I realize that movies often don't hold up to the book. But in this case there were some very important basics which were ignored.
The bad guy of the movie on one occasion has a date with a nice looking, normal woman. This is a guy who kidnaps women, abuses them and then kills them. This is his life, and he has a date?
At the end in the book, the bad guy drives his car into a logging truck, killing himself. In the movie he has an accident while trying to get away. Does not make sense.
Sally has no interest in looking attractive, but in the movie she always wears eye shadow and lipstick.",1410998400,3,721,4.1571428571428575

4223751,5,B003Y5H5HO,A brilliant literary adaptation that far outstrips the Swedish version in terms if production value. The score alone adds to the stifling atmosphere that only David Fincher could've delivered. One of my favorite movies in recent years.,1410912000,2,235,5.378378378378378

4223833,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Like to start off by saying that I haven't read the book yet.  It is on my ""to do"" list though.  It's waiting in my Kindle.  I started watching this series with the Swedish version of the movie.  I'd have to say I enjoyed both versions.  This  American version was better to me visually.  I can't decide which version of ""Lisbeth"" I like better the American version or the Swedish version.  I'm curious to know which one was more true to the book.  I won't know that until I finish reading it.  Miss Mara gave a great performance as ""Lisbeth"" I always enjoy Daniel Craig in movies.  I gave 5 stars because I'm a big fan of the Tattoo series.  It is worth a look and the cost of the instant stream.",1410480000,3,697,4.196969696969697

4223842,5,B003Y5H5HO,Love this book! Have seen the Swedish version of the film trilogy (both subtitled & English dubbed) which I really enjoyed but this was awesome in it's own right as well! That being said I KNEW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO & TOOK some STEPS to AVOID flashbacks or the like which anyone with a history of abuse should do before watching this movie. I have always loved Mikael & Lisbeth's characters from book to the screen & find it interesting to see how the actors portray the characters on screen. It's a brutal look at what happens to a girl who slips through the cracks in the system & is an innocent victim in a government cover-up involving her father who was a sadistic sociopath. There is graphic rape & torture as well as death (since the two main characters are tracking a serial killer through the majority of the movie) so it's not a film for everyone. I however am looking forward to the sequels and hoping against hope that they'll still be made at all!,1409184000,2,962,4.410112359550562

I was one of the fans of the book, and fans of the Swedish movies that was not impressed that there would be a Hollywood adaptation. I was such a fan of Noomi's portrayal of Lisbeth, but you guys have GOT to see Rooney Mara. She is phenomenal as Lisbeth, really encapsulating the role. And Daniel Craig is the perfect Mikael also. You've got this really dark, movie and characters, that is just so rich to watch on screen.

This movie, unlike the subtitled one was an edge of the seat drama.  Daniel Craig did a great job in his role but the ""girl with the dragon tatto"" really outdid him.

I haven't read the books in a while, but I was very able to follow this movie with ease, unlike the German version (and that has nothing to do with language).

Elizabeth is the most important character and in the American version she is 100% as described in the book. Also, the movie does not have as much gore and sex as in the book and the other version, still being faithful to the book, and not hiding any thing.

Craig, Plummer, and Skarsgard are their ususal highly competent.  Rooney Mara, of whom I'd never even heard, is just so good that you'd have to see this to believe it!

Most of the other reviewers have done far better than I ever could, so I'll not try a full effort.  But there's one thing I find curious about the story and the movie.  As a viewer, we know something in the first twenty or so minutes of a two and a half hour picture to figure out the mystery.  That said, I didn't figure it out, and obviously most people haven't, because I've not seen it mentioned.

Either I'm missing something, or we all did . . .  Ha!

4224406,4,B003Y5H5HO,"The reviews on this movie are a bit divided because its a remake of a novel thats a remake of a movie done in Swedish a few years ago but I found the director did a good job. I read the novel when it first came out, and while I thought it was good for the genre, I didn't get all the fuss about it. The novel is over 600 pages long, and like most mysteries, its a bit on the slow side. The director made a few changes to the story but overall kept to it. I thought the romance between Lisbeth and Mikael was a bit forced in the movie but its hard to portray the relationship when Lisbeth is such a quiet, passive character. While the novel can discuss the goings on in her mind, the movie has no outlet for that. Story in a nutshell: Mikael is a publisher who gets dinged because he published a story about a financier that he cant prove. He decides to take on a job figuring out a who dunnit from the 60s about a missing girl. Lisbeth was hired to do the background on him and gets tangled in to help him. Shes a ward of the state because she killed her dad as a kid and is considered to be a psychotic case. The family they are investigating are rich, filled with loonies, ex-nazis, and all around degenerates of their own. Turns out that Hilary isn't dead and Martin and their father raped her and she ran away with the help of a cousin who looks very like her. Martin tries to kill Mikael to keep his secret, but Lisbeth saves him. The head of the family gives Mikael info on the financier and he clears his name and Lisbeth robs him through hacking. For a dry mystery novel, the director did a good job of keeping to the story and making it suspenseful. Overall I enjoyed it.",1392595200,2,1680,4.093939393939394

From the moment it opens you will get sucked in like a vacuum. Watch it twice and you'll finally understand. This film was worth watching twice back to back and if you don't understand Lisbeth than it's worth investing time into her personality. If you don't like your outlook on life screwed with by just anybody, then by all means watch this movie so she can do it for you.

The second time I watched the American version, I like it better because it makes more sense since I could see the 2 lives of the characters played by Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig in parallel before they merged. The acting was excellent, in particular, the role of Lisbeth, played by Rooney Mara. I got a much better appreciation of her talent by watching the supplements to find out that she actually immersed herself in the role. For example, her piercings were real and she walked through Stockholm in the winter to get a real feel of settings. David Fincher is also a great director who is very detail oriented and brought out the best from the actors. Of course, Daniel Craig and the rest of the crew were also superb.

Also,Rooney Mara does a great job as the task-driven Ms. Salander in the story. These two play well off of each other and they keep the chemistry at a level that makes the viewer wonder the entire time as to their characters'real trust in each other.

THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION FROM AMAZON FOR WHY THEY THINK IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO SELL THIS RIP-OFF!!!

After finding this, I went back and read other buyers reviews and found that I am not the only one this has happened to; I haven't tried the DVD-R in my player, but those who have report that ""Both sound & picture were bad. Very disappointing............""

Since when is it acceptable to sell a DVD-R in retail package as being a legitimate product, anyways???

4224680,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I can't add anything to the positive reviews to this excellent film.

My focus in this review more of an observation of the Relationship between Mikael Blomkvist and Lisabeth Salander as presented in the movie.

As many has noted, Lisabeth's relationships with men ranges from nice/normal to hate/contempt (in all cases, she has her reasons)!

What struck me was the result of her first (physical) encounter with Mikael.

Why?

She fixed him breakfast!

Why?

She REALLY LIKED THIS (particular) MAN!

What struck me even more was the scene where (a)Lisabeth took her pleasure from him even as he was trying to have a discussion with her and (b)when it took a minute for her head to clear...I found that amusing...that is....SHE took HIM.  Earlier when Mikael first employed Lisabeth, we are treated to a scene where Lisabeth's in bed with another woman...

Where am I going with this?  Simple.

After all the domination by men (good or bad), she gets a chance to dominiate (and boy, does she) men!

But she really LIKES Mikael.  The significant scene was when she visited her former guardian (who apparently suffered a very serious stroke - as he can't talk or move) and tells him about Mikael as if they had some kind of ""normal"" future together.

Mikael obviously had a different view of their relationship.

Mikael went back to his married co-worker - and his former life.

I sat there and said to myself, what an idiot, I would've taken Lisabeth on the spot - yes, she had piercings and tattoos, but she was also very, very bright and loyal (note: loyal) and already had proven herself to him that she was there whenever he needed her.

And he walked away from her.

It made me cringe even more whenever I see that 'present' tossed into the trash...what a waste...but that's life?

Sometimes the best things are right in front of us...clich...but true.

Well, that's my take from this excellent film!

I (and many, many) others rate Girl with a Dragon Tattoo...Five stars!",1379721600,2,1976,4.75

4224682,3,B003Y5H5HO,"Yes, the hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was, for the most part, very well done and stayed fairly true to the story-line [whereas the european version was a sad and very inaccurate version].
However, the author, Stieg Larsson, made a major point in his book and the others in the series, to provide readers with some of the awful statistics about violence against women.  He wanted the reader to love the thriller [and we do] but he also wanted the reader to be appalled by our/society's continued countenance of the abuse, rape, and slavery of women all over the world - and America is a big offender.  So, for this movie to ignore one of the author's major points is nothing short of sad - very sad - and a gross injustice.",1379548800,7,746,4.477941176470588

I purchased and paid for a new DVD. Last night I opened it only to find that I too had received a Sony disk copy just like a previous reviewer. I was stunned. I've been ordering from Amazon for such a long time and have never gotten a pirated copy. It's too late now for me to change the feedback and I can't return it. But I will never buy from that seller again and I resent being dragged into something like this. I want nothing to do with illegal copies of movies. Frankly I'm surprised that someone would take such a risk and send them to unknown people through Amazon.

4224780,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I'm already a big David Fincher fan with both Fight Club and Se7en in my top ten list. As soon as I saw the gripping, unique, in-your-face trailer for ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" in theaters (and then repeatedly, over and over again, on YouTube), I knew that I had to see his latest entry. I had not yet read the book and had a mild interest in reading it, especially after a glowing review from my main man, Stephen King, but after seeing this preview, I quickly got to work, eager to see how well David Fincher worked with the source material.

I was not disappointed in the slightest. As with any other Fincher movie, we are treated to gorgeous and inventive cinematography, alternately blinding white in snowy locales or oppressively dark for interiors or night-time shots (with an expected lean toward the latter -- it is a Fincher flick, after all). We are also treated to yet another unique score spearheaded by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, perhaps one of the best pairings between a director and his composer(s) since Tim Burton began working with Danny Elfman. As hinted at in the trailer, the CGI-laden opening sequence is brilliant and sets the tone for the rest of the movie. It's evocative of the equally-innovative beginning of Fincher's earlier film, Fight Club, and marks the man as adept at creating memorable starts to his movies.

Even better, I found this adaptation to be superior to both the novel and the original Swedish film adaptation. The well-done novel contained both a taut murder mystery that kept me guessing the whole time in addition to a heartbreaking portrait of a female dominated and abused by the male-centric system that lords over her entire life, but I felt that it could have used a second look-through by another editor. It deviated from the main storyline at times, either with way too much information about Blomkvist's journalistic endeavors or a few too many scenes of romantic entanglements between Blomkvist and the many females of the story, ultimately bogging down the narrative. The screenplay instead streamlines much of the excess of the book, leaving behind a tighter, more focused story.

While the Swedish adaptation was a fine movie all its own, I found that it seemed way too rushed for my tastes, instead zipping along at a pace more suited to a typical thriller. Thanks to its two-and-a-half hour running time, Fincher's version has time to detail more of Lisbeth's everyday life and her interactions with Blomkvist, thus strengthening the core relationship that has stood as the most compelling element of the series. Noomi Rapace did a tremendous job as the first film version of Lisbeth, but she seemed older and more noticeably attractive than her depiction in the novel. Rooney Mara more closely fits my vision of Lisbeth -- in her twenties, often shabbily-dressed, and somewhat plain, appearing to match the ugliness that she frequently feels inside and more easily able to fly under the radar of casual observers. Daniel Craig is also a perfect choice for Blomkvist, wisely deviating from his stoic Bond demeanor. While he's certainly smooth with the ladies, he can prove here to be laughably unnerved after bullets have been shot in his direction, an excellent foil to Lisbeth's cool and measured response to danger.

The Blu-Ray version of this movie make a perfect package -- I can't tell you how excited I was to discover the ""pirated"" regular DVD copy in addition to the Blu-Ray main feature and extras discs. All are packed with great behind-the-scenes featurettes, interviews, commentary tracks, and appealing menu screens. If you're haven't seen this movie yet, you'll likely enjoy it if you're either a fan of the book or the movies of David Fincher. If you have, you'll be doing yourself a favor by picking up this excellent Blu-Ray treatment. (And it's easy on the wallet!)",1375142400,4,3861,4.89908256880734

We HAD to watch the film with subtitles, even with the volume up super high because we could hardly understand a word that Daniel Craig said.  BUT- Let me make myself clear, this is a good adaptation.  What the Swedish version left out from the book, this one added in.  So, between the two films you get a pretty good all-around adaptation.  I'm also not saying that the Swedish version is perfect- It's not.  However, I do feel as though it is ahead of this version because of the MUMBLING.

4224825,1,B003Y5H5HO,"I have not read the book so please realize that my opinion of this film is based on what I viewed.

My first thought after watching this film was, ""How could they have screwed up the movie this badly?"" The filmmakers had a fine mystery tale in their hands, yet they attempt to vamp it up with Swedish nihilistic ethically vapid characters combined with sexual violence--graphic rape and sodomy. It appeared to be a modern day tale yet the protagonists were the anti-hero types of the 60's/70's movie genre. The hero and heroine were more like dogs in heat than dogs on the trail to finding a murderer.

Lastly, the most improbable glaring inconsistency in the film was how a dysfunctional girl, who engages in sex for money, is able to steal 2,000,000,000 euros. She can steal from banks without being caught, but rather than do that, she first performs sexual acts in order to live. Simply unbelievable...",1372204800,6,906,4.727848101265823

4224872,2,B003Y5H5HO,"This movie has a good story to it, but there are some real problems.  The first is the length.  Too much time was wasted with scenes of the protagonists sitting on a train, crossing the bridge, and gratuitous sex scenes.  Cut these out, and the whole thing could have run in about 130 minutes.  We get the idea--the hero is traveling.  There is a bridge to cross to the island where the main action occurred.
D0o we need to see it every time the protagonist goes back and forth?  While I realize sex sells, these scenes added nothing to the plot, and how many times do we need to be shown the female protagonist's less than spectacular breasts bouncing around?  Let's get back to the plot--remember plot?
  Another problem is that this movie has the typical, European acting.  It is so under acted as to be dead.  A character may be saying ""I just won the lottery,"" or ""My dog died,"" but you cannot tell by tone of voice.  The only tone of voice available is terminal depression.  There is no joy, no excitement, no color at all, except dull, gray, flatline.
  Speaking of color,  that is something else lacking from this movie--at least I think it is lacking.  The lighting is so bad, so dark, that it is hard to tell.  I didn't care for film noir fifty years ago, and I don't cqare for it, now.  Even outdoor, daylight shots are dull, dreary, and gray.  There is no lightening of mood because there is no lighting.  Indoor scenes with Christopher Plummer made me wonder, ""if he's supposed to be so rich, how come he can't pay the light bill.""
  Finally, the plot was rather obvious.  If, by the time the final family member is interviewed, there is anyone who has not read the book, but does not know how this will play out, that person needs to go back to Blues Clues.",1371340800,4,1771,4.395061728395062

This certainly is no watered down version by any means and the opening credits start it all off with a bang. Wonderfully filmed, well acted, with Rooney Mara a total standout as the lead character. Dark, steely, cerebral, cold and almost clinical-sounds a lot like Seven or Zodiac. David Fincher has a very specific style and it shows throughout his filmography. Do be prepared for a LOT of dialogue and some fairly jolting ""under your skin"" violence. If you like your films sunny, fun, lightweight, and with a tidy ending, this is NOT the one for you. But if you like to be challenged and stimulated viscerally and this will be a film that you will enjoy.",1370304000,2,754,4.71969696969697
4224909,5,B003Y5H5HO,"The Millennium Trilogy by late Swedish author Steig Larsson proved to be a world-wide phenomenon. With the launch of the first novel in the international bestselling trilogy, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, readers fell in love with the misfit protagonist, Lisbeth Salander, and the novels gritty, dark content.

A Swedish film adaptation soon followed, and it was only a matter of time before American filmmaker David Fincher set out to leave his mark on the novel. Fincher, who directed the dark hits Seven, Fight Club, Zodiac, etc., was a perfect match for the difficult subject matter that the novel contained. In the film, Rooney Mara brings a vulnerable side to the dark character, Salander.

The film follows recently disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, played here by Daniel Craig, as he attempts to rebuild his life. He is called upon by Henrik Vanger to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, years ago. As Blomkvist begins to investigate, he discovers the gloomy past and unfortunate events that seem to have plagued the Vanger family. Essentially a locked room mystery, Blomkvist knows that Harriet's killer had to be a member of the family, as they were the only people on the family's island on that day.

This could have been a straight forward thriller, but the addition of the fascinating Lisbeth Salander elevates the story to another level. Salander is a ward of the state, who has a knack for anything technology related. On the outside, she appears as a kind of goth punk outcast, but her hacking skills have afforded her a comfortable career as an investigator. It is these skills that lead her to assist Blomkvist in his investigation.

The content of both the film and the novel is extremely dark and often uncomfortably graphic. There are scenes of great violence, including rape, and detailed portrayals of torture. Despite these disturbing moments, there is a heart to both Blomkvist and Salander that makes this a compulsively watchable movie. The adaptation stays true to the spirit of the novel while still standing alone as a commendable piece of filmmaking. This a a thrilling adult movie that brings the fantastic novel to life.",1370044800,3,2180,5.030470914127424

4224915,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I don't even know where to begin with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  For a movie with a 158 minute running time, I felt like I was just starting to get into it.  In a very good way.  A very deliberate film, there are no wasted moments.  David Fincher was born to direct mysteries/thrillers.

If story starts and ends with characters, then actors play a vital role in the success of a film.  If we accept that premise, then Dragon Tattoo is a huge success.  Rooney Mara deserves all the credit in the world for this performance.  I had previously thought that Michelle Williams in My Week with Marilyn was the only choice for the Best Actress Oscar, but Ms. Mara has made me realize that she is an actress to watch going forward.  Every choice she makes never betrays the character.  I also think that's why the film needs the violence and brutality it has.

At no point are any of the scenes gratuitous.  Yes, they may be uncomfortable for some, but in no way should they be done without.  In fact, without them, the character of Lisbeth Salander comes across as unrealistic and two-dimensional.  If movies are in fact to invoke the senses, which is in turn vital to any visceral experience with watching a movie, then the audience is in the best place to understand the character, which means they are in the best place for understanding the story.

As I said before, David Fincher is born to direct these kinds of films.  Every clue we the audience need is available (like in Se7en).  He plays no cheap tricks, yet he doesn't offer up the clues easily.  If ever there were a movie that required you to be an active audience member, this is it.

Don't even get me started with the technical aspects.  The cinematography is beautiful and the editing... let's just say there's a reason it won the Oscar.  Rarely have I been more confused, horrified, and moved by a movie, all the while loving every minute of it.

This is definitely David Fincher's best work since Zodiac or Fight Club. The Social Network may have gotten all the attention the year before, but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo deserved all it got and more.

4225000,4,B003Y5H5HO,"The Swedish version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the greatest foreign films in recent years, mostly due to the brilliant Noomi Rapace.

So an American remake sounds like an automatic fail, even one directed by David Fincher. But this remake is an unusually faithful one, especially for Hollywood -- not only is the film actually set in Sweden, but it preserves the bleak, icy atmosphere and violent undercurrents of the original. And while Rooney Mara is no Noomi, she and Daniel Craig do solid jobs as the leads.

Take-no-prisoners journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) has just lost his reputation, his savings and his freedom (hello, jail sentence!) after a nasty libel suit from a crooked executive.

Then he's unexpectedly contacted by aged industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), to discover what happened to the guy's grandniece, Harriet. She vanished years ago from the family's isolated island home, and her body -- alive or dead -- was never found. When Mikael agrees to take the case, he's cybershadowed by the abused goth hacker Lisbeth Salander (Mara).

Eventually Mikael ends up finding out about Lisbeth, and her very unique skills. Intrigued by this strange wounded woman, Mikael asks her to help him in his cold-case investigation, and the two begin unwinding a bizarre string of serial killings from long ago -- all tied to Bible quotes. And as Mikael unearths the clues to Harriet's disappearance, he also finds some skeletons long kept buried -- and a killer who might target him next.

""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" takes the typical murder mystery, and enfolds it in a ruthless look at modern Swedish society and the study of sexual aggression. It's a dark, dangerous, unfair world where the truth is quashed and women are treated horribly -- whether it's the long-missing Harriet or the eccentric, angry ""girl with the dragon tattoo.""

And Fincher gives it a surprisingly amount of loving care. No Americanized names, no switching the action to an American city, no soft-pedalling the gruesome sexual violence -- yep, that horrifying rape scene (and its gratifying payback) are here.

Fincher isn't quite able to capture the wild, raw beauty of Sweden, but he is able to give the movie a somber, icy quality -- even in warmer months, it feels chilly and lonely. He unfolds the story with a minimum of Hollywood pyrotechnics, instead focusing on a collage of photographs, coded messages and old crimes half-forgotten. It's only in the last act that things start building into a bloody, creepy thriller.

However, the wrap-up for the movie seems to drag. Yes, it's important to see what happens after the climax, especially if they're going to make a sequel -- but did we really need to SEE Lisbeth shopping for a wig?

Rooney Mara doesn't quite fill the screen with dark dynamism as Lisbeth Salander should, but she does give a compelling performance -- a cold, almost cyborg-like presence that can suddenly explode into jagged icy rage. Daniel Craig's Mikael can't quite compete with Lisbeth, but Craig gives an outstanding performance as a weary journalist whose life is threatened by his encounter with the Vangers, and given new vitality by Lisbeth.

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a bleakly beautiful piece of work -- the actors are excellent and Fincher shows great respect to the original movie. Here's hoping for the tale of a girl playing with fire.",1365120000,6,3417,4.978947368421053

4225008,3,B003Y5H5HO,"(Changed score from 4 to 3 after watching the foreign original on 2013Mar30.)

I started to watch the original foreign version once, but was sidetracked.  And I have never read the books, which may or may not be a good thing; it is often the case that people are biased to like the medium type they read or see first.  But I finally watched the English-language version today.

While I usually start with the positives during a review, I will start with the negatives, because I feel that the negatives outweigh the positives, even though ultimately I liked this film.  1.  Very difficult for an American to understand the dialog.  I felt like I still needed subtitles.  2.  The film is a little dark (in light), which adds to the mood, but also makes it difficult to follow some of the action.  3.  The film is too long, in my opinion, at about 2.5 hours.  Was this film actually two books condensed into one film?  It seemed that way to me, as I think that it would have been better to break this movie into two parts, as there was just too much going on.  4.  There are some minor torture scenes here, and I have a hard time watching those types of scenes, I will admit.

For the good?  Well, Rooney Mara is really good here, as you probably already know.  She seemed to be perfectly cast.  And Daniel Craig is almost always good; if you want to see him in a surprisingly well-cast role watch ""Infamous.""  And I'm a fan of Stellen Skarsgard as well; I thought that he was perfect in ""Good Will Hunting"" and he's very good here.  Heck, he was even good in ""Mama Mia,"" a very fun film that I really liked, almost as much as Lea Michelle on ""Glee.""  (That musical was her at-least fictional guilty pleasure on last week's episode.)

What's the theme of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo""?  Well, it might be that you-know-what never really changes.  Life goes on, and even if you acquire more money, old relationship issues just seem to keep hanging around.  At least that's what I got out of it.

I have to admit, these types of films are always tricky to follow, particularly when you don't know anything about the plot going in.  If you miss any scene -- even a part of a scene -- something later may refer back to what you missed and you might be lost.  But I'll give a minor recommendation on this film, despite its weaknesses.",1364342400,2,2330,4.378504672897196

Without trying to give away too much, the undercurrent of sexual brutality was a little too extreme for my tastes, but after reading all 3 of the ""Dragon Girl"" books, I can understand why. However, this movie version was a little too disjointed, too many things going on simultaneously. That's a little unavoidable with any complex story line, but I think the movie could have done a much better job of fleshing out more of the important scenes and themes while keeping the story coherent, and still convey the brutality of the story in less deliberately graphic ways.",1364169600,6,670,4.735042735042735

4225038,5,B003Y5H5HO,"This film is very striking and quality-made as is to be expected from director David Fincher.  The movie is an American adaptation of the novel by Steig Larsson not a remake of the 2009 Swedish film, I clarify, since some refer to the 2009 adaptation as ""the original""; this film is also an original and is a quite superior adaptation of the novel in my opinion (the 2009 version's only superiority being that it is Swedish like the novel). It is definitely better cast than the Swedish version with the actress portraying androgynous, hacker Lisbeth actually believable as a young woman in her early 20's; and the look of the character is more effortless, stylish and realistic, not cartoonish, cliche or forcibly put together like that of the swedish adaptation. The magnificent performances in addition to the superb cinematography, score and editing make a nearly three hour film flow with consistent interest for the viewer who is never bored, lost or disengaged(whether they have read the novel or not).  For those not familiar with the novel or it's content, be prepared, some of the violent sequences are quite graphic, but they are what make the film so effective.  The quality of the blu-ray meets the film's excellence and delivery by amazon and their pre-order discount are always beyond compare. That said, I couldn't help feel utter disappointment when I received the blu-ray combo. I was particularly excited to get a digital copy of the film to add to my iPod, but discovered that UltraViolet digital copies function in a very convoluted manner.  This 'digital copy' is merely license to online streaming and cannot be transferred or downloaded to iTunes, only to devices themselves; therefore this rules out getting use of the numerous gigabytes of an ipod classic or other non-wifi devices.  Now that I am familiar with ultraViolet digital copies I am never purchasing such a combo again, I'd rather download from iTunes than foment the sale of these 'digital copies'.

4225042,5,B003Y5H5HO,"David Fincher is one of the most visually stylistic filmmakers in the world today and his version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' is nothing short of what to expect from this acclaimed director.

I think everyone is pretty familiar with the plot of the story, but since these are called ""reviews"" I'll just give it to you in a nutshell. Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist for a Swedish magazine named Millennium. After getting into some hot water with a seemingly fabricated story involving a politician, Mikael is called upon by Henrik Vanger to investigate the disappearance of his grandniece Harriet forty years ago. According to police records she is assumed dead but Henrik believes she is still alive. Later Mikael teams up with Lisbeth Salander (played brilliantly by Rooney Mara), a computer hacker with a disturbing past who has a photographic memory and great interest for the case. From there onwards the mystery slowly unravels and the shocking truth is told.

Ok now the Blu-Ray comes to us from Sony Pictures and I must say they have done an excellent job with both the picture and the sound quality. The packaging inside is great with both pictures of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara as their characters amongst the snowy landscape. I highly recommend this Blu-Ray for anyone who loves David Fincher films and for anyone who doesn't mind a little black in their coffee.",1363305600,3,1401,4.882352941176471

The book may be amazing, and the original Swedish version of the film might be equally amazing, but David Fincher's adaptation of it is not. From the very beginning it seems as thou he's trying to turn this story into something it's not, a sequel to Seven. The story is fantastic, however, there are so many odd names and so many mumbled lines thrown at you so quickly, that you're easily confused. At many points in this film I was confused, and even when the killer was revealed, my reaction was ""which one is that?"" Besides being confusing, the film has about an hour of footage that has nothing to do with the main story and just adds to the overall confusion of the film. Like I said, the story is really good, the actors were really good also, but the film was just very long and confusing, and to be honest, I really wasn't all that impressed by it.",1361491200,,1015,4.375661375661376

4225070,4,B003Y5H5HO,"This movie leaves you exasperated.  The plot surrounding the toxic Vanger family is hard to digest, and the gloom, ultra-violence, and isolation that the two main characters experience are a downer.  Maybe that speaks to how good this film is; it brings you into its dark and twisted world, and you leave feeling dirty.  It did not give me nightmares, but I felt like I had been down in a dark hole for three hours.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is based upon an international best-selling trilogy that focuses on punkish cyber-sleuth Lisbeth Salander, played by an almost unrecognizable Rooney Mara (look her up after you see this movie to witness the transformation).  Lisbeth is waifish, pale, tattooed to the High Heavens, and a whiz with technology.  She also has a photographic memory and is supremely anti-social.  As a ward, she relies upon her custodian for funds to survive.  This becomes a problem when her lenient custodian suffers a debilitating stroke and she is re-assigned to a pervert that makes her perform disgusting acts for advances.  This is where her darkest and most violent side comes out, and some of the grizzliest violence in the film lies in two scenes involving Lisbeth and the deviant social worker that controls her purse strings.  You feel bad for Lisbeth because she has gone through a lot of difficulty in her life, but her retaliation is over-the-top and shows her taste for extreme revenge.

Daniel Craig's character is not someone you feel bad for.  He is a jerk, self-interested, and not a very clever or perceptive investigative journalist.  When he gets caught red-handed doing something he was not supposed to be doing about 2/3 of the way through, I thought it was about time he got what was coming to him.  Complete aside: notice the annoying habit of how he awkwardly hangs his glasses off his face.  If someone did that while I was talking to them I would be too distracted to pay attention to what they were saying.

I was expecting a lot from the score to this movie.  It was done by Trent Reznor and Atticus Finch, who scored the background music for The Social Network.  I felt like the score in The Social Network was a work of art in itself and effectively augmented the feel of the movie, so I anticipated big things here.  It did not not deliver in the same way.  There were still the beeps and boops and pounding bass of electronic music and some nice building sound drama, but it just did not deliver.

This movie makes it seem like Sweden is an extremely depressing place.  Everyone dresses in dark colors, looking like hip and modern yuppies, it is always snowing profusely, and all the people in the film despise each other.  The landscape is an important element of the story--all of the Vangers live on an island that is cut off by a bridge.  It made me wonder whether the island itself, and the isolation it supported, led to the weird behavior by the Vangers.  In any event, this movie will not make Sweden seem like an attractive vacation spot.

Overall, I liked this movie quite a bit.  I understand that the book was pretty complex, so putting it on film in a manageable (short enough) form is difficult.  As a stand-alone piece with no connection to the trilogy, this was not bad.  There was suspense and mystery, but some key links in the chain were not explained well enough to make me feel satisfied.  Rooney Mara's performance was impressive considering that she looks like a total freak and had to physically transform herself and go through some grueling abuse for the role.  Seeing that discipline alone was worth the price of admission.",1361491200,2,3614,4.67987321711569

I think all the actors  in both films were outstanding.  Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara both were fantastic although they each brought something different to the character neither slighted her in the least and the same can be said for the other actors/characters as well.

And that about sums it up for me too...it is a brutal story on a couple of levels. First, the brutality associated with the Vanger family of industrialists in Sweden, headed up by patriarch, Henric (Christopher Plummer) who may be the only sympathetic character in the bunch. Henric hires Mikael Blomkvist, (Daniel Craig) a down and out investigative journalist, ostensibly to write a biography of Henric; but actually to investigate the disappearance of his grandniece Harriet, some 40 years earlier. To assist in the investigation, Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) an unusual researcher and computer hacker. A secondary brutal aspect of the film involves the loutish treatment - including rape - of Lizbeth by her court appointed guardian. Martin (Skellan Skarsgard) the brother of the missing grandniece, is another primary character. While the overall casting is near perfect, the most powerful performance is by Rooney Mara as Lizbeth...if you have seen Mara in other films, you know how beautiful she is, and it is a shock seeing her for the first time in this film...a shock that never completely wears off. And her performance is phenomenal...she certainly deserved her Oscar nomination.",1359331200,3,1331,5.253521126760563

4225126,3,B003Y5H5HO,"Literary debuts don't get any bigger than the Millenium trilogy authored by Swedish journalist, Stieg Larrson.  With worldwide sales of over 53 million copies, it was only a matter of time before the books would inevitably be turned into American films.  And when that time came, it was almost equally inevitable that David Fincher, director of thrillers such as Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, and Zodiac, would be the auteur of choice to helm such nihilistically, dark material.

So does the film work?  Sadly, that question is not as easy to answer as one might expect.  On the one hand, Fincher's extensive experience honed over the past 26 years in the industry has taught him how to focus this story, which, in its original printed form, was a bit meandering at times.  Moreover, he knows how to frame a scene, and so, as one would expect, the film looks and sounds stunningly beautiful.  There is a raw elegance in the landscapes he captures that perfectly mirrors the hollow nature of the main characters' souls.  And likewise, the brief, but shockingly potent, bursts of extreme violence are captured in such a way as to actually advance the storyline as opposed to being voyeuristic outlets for those that fancy the emerging genre of ""torture-porn.""

So what's missing?  The heart of the novel.  Prior to making its way across the Atlantic, the novel was published in Sweden under the name Man som hatar kvinnor, which translated into English means: Men Who Hate Women.  At its core, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is about misogyny on scales writ both large and small.  While Fincher expertly captures the larger, grotesque acts of violence perpetrated against women, he misses the small acts found in his main character, Mikael Blomkvist.  For you see, in the book, Blomkvist's defining characteristic is his alarmingly, insatiable sexual appetite.  He regularly sleeps with every single major female character in the book, the likes of which include: a woman half his age (Salander), his married co-owner of the magazine he works for, as well as the married niece of the man who hired him to solve the 40-year old cold case.  But here, in Fincher's film, he is only ever shown sleeping with Salander, which completely alters the meaning of the closing scene.

*** MILD SPOILER ALERT ***

When Salander comes to give Blomkvist a gift at the end of the film, she sees him walking off into the night with his colleague.  And the rage she feels isn't merely the rage of jealousy, as it is in the film.  The rage she feels, in the book, is the rage of having once again been violated by a man who took advantage of her to satisfy his own sexual urges.  In other words, in the book, Blomkvist is among the misogynistic offenders who violate women by their casual willingness to sexually use and discard them.  But here, in the film, it simply comes across as Salander being jealous of a new lover, because Fincher never sees fit to show Blomkvist, the ostensible ""hero"" of the film, as guilty in his own way.

But this should not come as a surprise in American culture.  For ours is a culture that hypocritically glorifies the sexual promiscuity of men, even as it purports to uphold female dignity and empowerment as a national virtue.  So, in the end, Fincher's curious decision to white-wash his lead character is not surprising, and yet, it is absolutely fatal to the film because it effectively neuters Larrson's central message, and reduces the film to nothing more than a visually splashy who-dunnit shot in exotic locales.  And in a society that openly degrades women in the manner that ours does, this is a shame because Larrson's core theme is one that could really have challenged people to think.

We saw it at the theater first and decided that there were too many details that were hard to keep tract of, so decided to have our own copy.

Had I been alone I would have left the theater!!!  I won't bother watching the rest of the series when it hits the big screen.

This American version tries to condense all three books into one film.  In so doing, it loses much in content and changes other plot elements in an effort to achieve continuity within the abridged story lines.  Had I not read the books, I would have found the continuity even more problematic and the changes were sometimes actually bothersome.  Also, the actors in the Swedish version look more as I would have pictured them and seem more comfortable in their roles - this is particularly true of the female lead.

Of course, some of the things that I like may be things that other viewers dislike - that will be up to the individual. Hopefully, this will provide information for those of you reading it to make an accurate decision on whether or not to buy/watch the movie.

What I liked (please keep in mind that I have not read the book or seen alternate versions of the film):

- The story was complex: There was a detailed, complex and well developed plot to this movie. Much of the plot is expressed in the large amount of dialog in the film, so be prepared (I used subtitles just to make sure I didn't miss anything - but I almost always do that). If you are going to watch this movie, plan to play close attention so you don't miss important details.

- Great cast and characters: Characters were well developed and changed (for better or worse, depending) as the movie progressed. The actors, as well, put a lot of time and effort into ensuring that they portrayed characters well and they did fantastic jobs.

- Terrific score: While in many films, the score seems to be almost an afterthough - something you don't necessarily notice - it is extremely well done in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.

What some may not like:

- There are rape scenes in the movie: While quite disturbing, they were a small part that I felt the rest of the movie made up.

- Violent: There is a fair bit of violence in the movie. It didn't bother me, but it may potentially bother some viewers.

- Very dark: This is not a happy, feel-good movie. I thought it was a very good movie. But it is not somthing that I would recommend if you're looking for an uplifting film. This movie deals with mental illness, murder, rape and many of the darker sides of human nature. Again, I felt this potential downside was outweighed by the good plot and characters, but for some it may be a reason not to watch the film.

- Long movie: The movie is longer than many, which may just mean a bit more planning to ensure you have time to finish it.

Summary:

I completely realize that this movie is not for everyone, and I understand the reasons behind this. Personally, I really enjoyed the film - but I know many who absolutely hated it. I hope that this review will help others to determine which category they will fall into before either dismissing too soon, or watching something that they may potentially hate (or find upsetting).",1356739200,5,2619,4.412863070539419

4225278,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Stylish, gripping, engrossing, and gives you the thrill of being an in-the-know, sophisticated participant of victory of good over evil, without revealing to you the killer on a cold case, unless you figure it out about 4/5 ths of the way through. The cold case is the disappearance of a granddaughter of a Swedish millionaire. You are given a long litany of the family, but it's fast and confusing.

This movie projects the anti-fascist values of book author Stieg Larsson, yet it could have done more (and gone beyond the book). The ball was dropped on its full potential on that point, for one. (I have not read the book, but I have read about the prematurely-deceased Larsson.)

Though there was extensive use of older actors in the film, I did not like the fast cuts away from them (the sisters, mates, librarians). It was annoying on more than one level. The sister in London especially deserved more. Some humor there too. That said, the heroes, especially heroine portrayed by newcomer Rooney Mara, are fantastic.

Gratuitous sex, beware, parents.

As far as technology, very smart. As far as styling, bring it on. Love the music, especially Led Zeppelin starter, Immigrant Song.",1356566400,3,1187,4.890547263681592
4225279,5,B003Y5H5HO,"A well written script whose main quirky character Lisbeth Salander is brilliantly acted by Rooney Mara.  A dragon tattoo on her back, pierced body earrings just about everywhere, a punk hairdo, black lipstick, she certainly commands attention.  Abused as a child, endowed with off the chart analytical skills and a photographic memory and also one mean bitch she is someone you don't want to cross.  Raped by her parol officer the scene where she gets revenge is unforgettable.  Mikael Blomkvist, played by Roger Craig, in my opinion the co-star, is Roger Craig,  We know who he is and what he is capable of.  The plot concerns a 40 year old apparent murder of a wealthy Swedish Industrialist niece.  His dysfunctional family gives us plenty of suspects.  Mikael (Roger Craig) well respected journalist is hired to uncover who done it and soon, with the help of Lisbeth, uncovers a sadist serial killer.  This movie is not for kids, but if you enjoy an intricate plot, brilliant cast and well acted -- don't miss it.  By the way this movie is the first of a trilogy.  All three books have been made into movies in Swedish -- the authors native language -- and also brilliantly acted and cast.  If you don't mind subtitles I also recommend those movies.  Stieg Larsson wrote the books and left us with some real thrillers before his untimely passing.",1356566400,3,1349,4.762931034482759

The acting is fantastic and the great editing moves the story along perfectly. I was never bored or confused about what was happening on screen.

4225336,4,B003Y5H5HO,"MOVIE RATING:  4 stars (B+)

Being that I'm 50% Swedish and that I've visited Sweden 3 times in my life so far (with a 4th coming in 2015), I'm always interested in movies from the homeland. Whether it's movies set in Sweden, filmed in Sweden, about Swedes, starring Swedes, or made by Swedes. Combine that with one of my favorite directors of all time, David Fincher, and one could easily say I had ""MASSIVE"" expectations for The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011). As my #1 Most Anticipated Movie of Fall 2011, director David Fincher's english-language remake of the Swedish film had a lot to live up to. And it kind of didn't initially. When I first saw the movie in the theater late last year, I was a bit disappointed. It just wasn't exactly what I expected. I thought it lacked the extremely sharp and intelligent writing and feel of The Social Network (2010), Se7en (1995), and Fight Club (1999). Of course the acting, production design, cinematography, editing, sound, and music are all stellar and as good as any of Fincher's finest films. But the story just didn't grab me like those three masterpieces at first. I now see I was a bit too harsh on it. So I've upgraded my initial rating of 3.5 stars to 4 stars.

Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara, Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgrd and the rest of the supporting cast give absolutely wonderful performances. The casting was spot on. Yorick van Wageningen was an incredible discovery as the man that tortures and rapes Lisbeth Salander. As with every Fincher film, the production design is so perfectly detailed and brought to life that I felt completely like I was in Sweden (as I remember it from my trips), down to the details of the open-faced sandwiches. Donald Graham Burt is a master Production Designer, and that's evidenced by his incredible filmography. Of course Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' score is hypnotizing, surprisingly appropriate, and flat out original. I don't know how these guys come up with their music, and how Fincher and his editing team incorporate these pieces so well, but they did it again after nailing it on The Social Network (2010).

I really can't say enough about how beautiful and perfect the cinematography is by Jeff Cronenweth and his team. Shot entirely on Red digital cinema cameras, mostly the Red Epic, TGWTDT reminds us all why film is basically dead as the primary medium for making movies today. With the Red Epic and Arri Alexa digital cinema cameras, the imagery and dynamic range that can be captured in various lighting conditions is simply the best its ever been in the digital age. And Cronenweth really knows how to use his Red tools. You can take just about any and every frame from the movie (all 227,520 of them), and look at it as a piece of still art work.

The editing team of Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall provided a technically perfect edit that seamlessly marriages dialog, visuals, sound effects, music, and graphics, but I do think TGWTDT suffers from a pacing problem in its storytelling sometimes. It stalls and lags at times, causing me to lose interest. Whether that's an issue of writing within the screenplay from screenwriter Steven Zaillian, or an editing issue, I'm not totally sure. I haven't seen the original Swedish movie or read the original Stieg Larsson novel, so it's hard to say if it's in the translation from Swedish to English, or from book to film, or if it's just David Fincher's style. I do think the pacing is less of an issue on repeated viewings when one knows what's going to happen and where its going. But that's true of most movies. Regardless, I do think this was a very successful remake of a foreign language film that brought an original approach to the material and a new style and feel to it to appeal to an American audience. I actually hope they do remake the other 2 films in the trilogy.",1355616000,3,3848,4.694814814814815

Had I not read the books, I'm not sure I would have been able to follow and understand the movie.  The acting and photography are excellent.  The movie closely follows the first book which causes it to bounce around in time and place.  Will a second and third film be produced for the remaining two books?  I am doubtful, but I hope so, even if it is a difficult story to follow.

4225395,4,B003Y5H5HO,"There's no denying that the source material for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is brutally graphic and downright depressing. Don't expect a happy-go-lucky mystery film when you watch it as the themes and tones are extremely dark and there a couple of scenes that are very hard to stomach (if you've read the book, you know what scenes I'm talking about). However, the thing that makes this movie so good is that fact that, even with this dark and troubling plot, the film is still able to be captivating and enthralling.

Enough can't be said for Rooney Mara's performance as Lisbeth Salander, who shows total and utter dedication to the title role. Her on-screen presence can't be denied and I believe this is a part she was born to play. Daniel Craig is also terrific in the film as the investigative protagonist, bringing an intense yet charismatic feeling to the character. Equally impressive is David Fincher's directing, which is on full display here. Having seen everything he's been involved with from Alien 3 to Social Network, I believe this is one of, if not the best, film he's done to date.

This movie can't be recommended to everyone but if you enjoyed the book as much as I did, you'll more than likely enjoy watching this movie. I haven't seen the original Swedish version so I can't make any comparisons, but this U.S. version is quite a treat.",1354665600,5,1363,4.698744769874477

Craig is of course great in the film, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth doesn't seem like she was that Into the role at times. I found myself thinking certain scenes weren't up to par or as powerful as in the Swedish film, for instance: when Lisbeth is mugged near the beginning there is no sense of Danger at all involved, its just a Simple bag snatching scene with Her yelling distortedly at the single mugger. And another example would be at the end where the Car explodes. It really isn't as powerful or deep compaired to the Swedish version. And the same goes for the flashbacks. As i stated, the film isn't bad at all - i just feel Fincher could've done much more with the story. Hopefully the next one is better.

4225450,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I've seen this movie at least half a dozen times.  I just ordered the blu-ray version.  How many movies do you have in your collection that you can watch repeatedly and still enjoy as much as when you saw them in a theater for the first time?  There are so many great scenes to look forward to and so few scenes to fast-forward through.  This is movie-making at it's very best.  The story is a brilliant one, and the script, acting and directing are highly intelligent and thoroughly entertaining.

The Swedish version was a TV series that seemed rushed and mechanical to me.  I'm not a fan of acting wherein the emotions of the characters are absent or implausibly stoic.  I found the acting wooden and forgettable.  I much prefer Rooney's Lisbeth and Craig's Blomkvist.  Rooney's Lisbeth is a conflicted and vulnerable character whose anger and brutalities are more obviously borne of an emotionally brutalized past and a physically brutalized present.  She isn't anti-social without reason or justification.  Craig's Blomkvist is smart enough and unaffected enough to make Lisbeth's trust and attraction to him plausible.  I found no reason whatsoever for Rapace's Lisabeth to trust or be attracted to Nyqvist's Blomkvist.  There was nothing about his character or his acting choices that made sense to me.

Finally, Fincher is a great director.  He makes movies I want to watch over and over again.  His is a much more entertaining depiction of the book than the Swedish version is....in my opinion.

By the way, I thought Rapace was totally miscast in Prometheus.",1353628800,6,1568,4.942528735632184

It is, without doubt, and hard to disagree with, that the books are amazing ~ truly great reading...albeit a bit disturbing. I, however, do NOT agree with others who have rated this movie so badly because they liked the Swedish version more. It's true, that the Swedish movies are great. Noomi Rapace is an amazing actress and SHOULD have been cast in the English version. However, I found Rooney Mara quite convincing. One thing I can agree on is that Daniel Craig was miscast in this role - that or the guy should have put on a Swedish accent - Now THAT was unbelievable. But, I can put those things aside and enjoy the movie for what it was. Not everyone will like a foreign movie with subtitles (I never watch dubbed versions of foreign films - looses too much), so, this film DOES stand on it's own and is good entertainment. I also LOVE the fact that it keeps the Trilogy going....So, here's hoping they continue on with the next 2 installments - cause, I, for one, will be at the cinema to see them.",1353456000,4,1087,4.3861386138613865
4225452,5,B003Y5H5HO,"All of these comments are modulo IMO only, personal taste will come through. I'm not rehashing the synopsis - you already know it.
It was a faithful enough rendering of the Larsson story. I think Craig worked extremely well, I was pleasantly surprised by his subtle repertoire of gestures, movements and facial expressions that spoke volumes.  Mara was fantastic but not as perfect a fit for Salander. The crucial scene imo was her `Terminator Mode' when attacking Bjurman, Mara was simply not ferocious enough.
Way too much talking and techno-explanation, no need to follow the book, everyone knew there was a camera there, all she had to do was turn on the TV - done. On the other hand the fact that her laptop was broken is so easy to miss at the end of the subway shot. This, imo, was important in linking why she needed money.
The editing is absolutely top notch, it tells the story effortlessly, won the Academy I think. Photography and setting are perfect. Bits are changed from the book and some are borrowed from the second book, but no biggie. Great twist - and deviation from the book -about Harriet near the end.

Coolest Scene: Salander is asking Craig - 007 licensed to kill - Blomkvist ""May I kill him?"" What do you think he said? ;)
Hardest to watch: Salander trying to shower after the brutality. In that few seconds scene is her entire character and Mara nails it. You can feel the horror and agony. (As I recall it's also the first time we get to see the dragon)
Sweetest scene: Blomkvist runs his hand up her back as she is lying face down hacking away, when he removes it she says, ""Put your hand back on my back."" 100% feminine. And Craig - with the typical clueless duffus male look- does exactly as she instructs. Perfection.
Best technical moment: She is writing a query - not typical system/app code - to do a database search. That made me smile.
Most subtle: Everyone is using an Apple machine, except the killer, it looked like a PC monitor. (And no - I hate Apple and their - It's my way or the hiway. And yes - the wife (aka the master) *made* me buy two iMacs)

Side comment: Salander is - again IMO - one of my favorite Science Fiction characters of all time The Stainless Steel Rat - Jim DiGriz

Aside: The graphic novel - Vol I. OMG I was almost physically sick.",1353456000,14,2296,4.446555819477434

It's a syndrome that effects people cognitive abilities in a variety of ways some times even giving them something of an added intelligence. This was an aspect of the movie I quite enjoyed since I once knew a girl who had aspbergre's and that she too resembled the star of the movie in that she was diminutive in stature.

4225481,3,B003Y5H5HO,"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (American)

Let me start by saying this is a review of the American version after having read the book & seen the Swedish version. The storyline in the movies remains the same essentially with differences in casting, sets & closeness to the book. Some are small such as differences in closeness to the book some are larger as in sets & casting.

The American version was correct to use Swedish settings but where they lag is in the cleanliness of the sets. This is a personal preference but I prefer the more natural gritty look & feel on the Swedish version. A notable point in the American version's favor is that it is slightly closer to the story as told in the book. The American wins by a nose here, a good example is at the end where the antagonist is dealt with. Neither the Swedish or English gets it correct & it changes your final view of both characters involved but the American is closer to the book here.

The real difference is in casting, the Swedish version has it correct in both the case of Mikael Blomkvist & Erika Berger. They look older, like people that have had a long term relationship based on a slightly hedonistic sexual lifestyle. There's a little meat on them from their long years of late night work & odd hour meals plus their casual use of alcohol over the years. It fits the printed news industry. Mikael & Erika's relationship is not based on looks. It is based on their appetite & the fact that Mikael likes strong women that don't wait for a man to initiate sex. If his sexual relations had been based on looks then Lisbeth would never have had a chance with him. The American one is Hollywood American casting. They have a gym rat body as Mikael & a thin Erika which certainly doesn't fit her notable lifestyle. It seems that Hollywood would have us believe that only thin people have good sex & that doesn't fit reality at all. It's a common problem in movies from Tinsel Town. They polish the sets & polish the bodies if at all possible.

The part that Rooney Mara took on was a courageous move on her part & she does well with it but that role was owned by Noomi Rapace as well as any role in cinema has ever been owned before. Still, the acting in the American version is very good so I'm really complaining of American tendencies in casting as versus the job done by casting in Sweden.

I know that a lot of Americans dislike hearing a foreign language for an entire movie not to mention having to read subtitles & that would qualify as a personal preference. I believe those people are missing some of the world's best cinema & would urge them to view the Swedish version as I believe it is a better experience visually. It is certainly a more dynamic performance by Noomi as Lisbeth Salander.

I gave the American version 3.5 Amazon stars as opposed to 5 Amazon stars for the Swedish version for the above reasons. The American is surely worth seeing & is surprising, enjoyable & a wonderful mystery / social commentary on Sweden. The book is the best of the lot as it has the pages that detail the statistics on sexual assaults on women. The story after all is about Swedish societal & government lack of care about abuse of women in Sweden & not just Lisbeth Salander's life.

The book title was more appropriate being MEN WHO HATE WOMEN, not as dramatic as TGWTDT perhaps, but the movie titles sort of muddle the storyline since they focus our attention on this one woman. I can see where people that only watch American language movies are, in my opinion, better off to watch the American one than skip it & would even say that those who watched the Swedish version only, should see Fincher's remake. I am firmly of the opinion that the Swedish is the best though.",1352505600,2,3746,4.436046511627907

I don't want to dive much into plot so as not to spoil this gem for the 10 people left in the world who have neither read the book nor seen the movie. I'll just say watch the film. It is great!

4225534,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I didn't find it necessary to remake the Millennium series so quickly after it came out in Sweden, but I think David Fincher did a great job, as usual. I can't complain about the acting or the cinematography (as usual it looks great like all of Fincher's movies) or anything really except for the opening credits with the terrible Trent Reznor song that plays out like a bad opening for a James Bond movie that doesn't fit the look and feel of the movie at all. If you can manage to get through the terrible opening (which I almost didn't) then you will probably enjoy the movie just fine. Trent butchers Led Zeppelins ""Immigrant Song"" for the opening title sequence and then Bryan Ferry's ""Is Your Love Strong Enough"" at the ending credits (this song you may recognize from Tangerine Dream's score for the end credits of Ridley Scott's 1985 fantasy film, Legend). The music in the movie is fine, but the terrible opening and ending song started with me feeling annoyed and upon ending left me feeling annoyed. Trent Reznor made better music when he was on heroin and shouldn't be molesting other peoples songs and if he does, they certainly shouldn't be used in such a way. I know it seems like a stupid thing to complain about, but when the first thing you see and hear are flat out awful, it really takes you out of the film and does another wise  really great adaptation, a huge disservice. If you liked the original then you'll like this, if you like David Fincher movies like Seven or Fight Club, then you'll like this. This movie looks immaculate on Blu-Ray, has tons of special features and is well worth the money. Also, lots of good female nudity which is always a plus in my book.",1349049600,4,1691,4.526143790849673
4225535,5,B003Y5H5HO,"WARNING-SPOILER!!! I recently saw this film on my cable provider's V.O.D. service, in which you can 'rent' films for $4.99. As soon as it was over, I jumped in the car & ran to the 24 hour Wal-Mart & bought it for my collection! Collecting films (& music) is/has been a serious hobby for me since I was a kid & VHS was the main format! My DVD Collection spans over 2,400+ & growing daily.
  This particular film is, to me, a masterpiece. David Fincher (Se7en, Panic Room) outdid himself w/ the mood, angles, & general helming of the picture. The cast-terrific! Craig does so well as Blomkvist, that you forget that he ever was in a Bond/007 picture-let alone Bond himself! Tricia Rooney Mara in the role of Salander? I have no words. & I believe THAT alone speaks volumes! Stellan Skarsgard is wonderfully evil in the most elegant way & you can see that he enjoyed every minute of this role! The supporting cast was chosen perfectly. Christopher Plummer, Joley Richardson, Robin Wright, & a nice cameo by Alan Dale (Season 3 of ""24"")!
  I found there to be a touch of a film-noir feeling around the whole mystery & how Fincher chose to film it. Perhaps it wasn't intentional, but friends of mine (that know film) also sensed it as well! The feel of this film is quite unique. Suspense is abundant, as well. The DVD itself looks like a 'bootleg', as it's on a Sony DVD-R, & the title looks like it was written w/ a Sharpie, but it is NOT! This caused a bit of confusion upon the inital release! If you look closley @ the disc, you'll see the 'razor blade' printed-the same 1 that Lisbeth wears around her neck in the picture!
  The Bonus Feature that you get w/ the DVD is a Feature-Length Audio Commentary by Fincher, which I seriously suggest taking a listen to! The insight is very detailed! The 'cover-art' is really unique. The packaging is all cardboard & folds out to reveal different images from the film. Having the original 'cover-art' is very, very important to me. I will not add a film to my collection w/out it!
  This is a 4-star film-hands down & will be a classic, I'm sure. If you love mysteries, suspense, & great filmaking-don't rent it, just buy it!",1348963200,2,2169,4.473417721518987

I loved all the performances from Daniel, Stellan, Christopher, Robin along with the rest of the cast. But Rooney Mara really stands out for me and I am sure for alot of people who saw this in the theaters last year. She deserved all the recognition she got from this performance as Lisbeth Salander.

Noomi knows when to be expressionless and when to express a little.  And the bad guys in the original, you couldn't help but really despise them.

The worst mistake they made is including a Digital copy that looks like an illegitimate copy of the DVD that has ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" in what appears to be hand written on it. I myself thought that I had a Pirated disc, until I looked at it very closely, then placed it in my Studio Grade Samsung player and pulled up the information that tells me the disc has 5.1 DOLBY Digital sound and closed captioning which you can not include when you make a copy of a movie. I even went to the extent to call Sony Pictures and asked them why they made a disc like this, and was told that it was a marketing ploy to make the disc look more Gothic. Like it or not, don't get confused and think you have a Pirated copy of this movie even though the art work on the other two discs is terrible in my opinion.

I just had to stop watching this DVD at the point when (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) the investigative reporter beds the mysterious young Miss Salander.  Oh, GAWD, like we needed that to move the story?  To justify to moronic Americans how the reporter could possibly want to help her?

With way too much obvious and dull dialogue, this American version has no subtlety.

The writing of dialogue is not the only wooden object in this waste of money.  Hollywood's Rooney Mara delivers none of the charisma and fascination turned on by Noomi Rapace.  Daniel Craig's pseudo Swedish accent sometimes gives way to working class London at odd times.  It's incredibly distracting (far more distracting than dealing with English subtitles over the Swedish).

Sure, some of these scenes were not very well characterized but the book does not do much better. Too much sex in this without clear exposition of the relationship. To have it end as it did so quickly and with little dialogue as to why was just odd. I know the novels were written somewhat like this but I don't think the film, not sure about the Swedish ones, portrays these characters well enough to end something on such a terse and negative note.

You cannot just show two characters loving and making eyes at each other, no matter how demented, and then show the main lead off with his old ex again, eliciting a reaction from the former lady that kind of ruins the end of the picture in this context. We won't see or clear anything up for way too long and it may be too late if the other American versions are even made. I say just give it the old hollywood ending and be done with it if you are going to make it such a sexy romp. I really don't care to wait around for the sequels. I didn't care for the content of the written sequels either. They should have deviated from the book a bit but then of course you would have a mass of angry teens at your door.

Anyway, the direction and sound are top notch. Fincher and Reznor have made some great stuff here. I just think the love affairs in this film needed to be treated with more subtlety and explained more. Does Blom even care for Liz? In this film they seem to care about each other a lot. He could have at least situated the whole thing a bit better before going back to banging the Millenium chick. Again, a couple of flaws in the text as well, though it comes off much better there, that I don't care to get into. The ending with the hacking of billion was also kind of laughable. I pretty much ignore the last 10 minutes of this film. I liked it though and had some fun watching it.",1345334400,,1949,4.126315789473685

4225620,1,B003Y5H5HO,"The original Swedish-made Michael Nyqvist/Noomi Rapace version BLOWS AWAY this American-made Daniel Craig/Rooney Mara version.  Noomi Rapace is so far superior in the role of Lisbeth compared to Rooney Mara that it's a joke--NO comparison.  It seems like Rooney Mara is some 15-year-old girl playing dress-up and pretending to be Lisbeth in some high-school drama club version of this story.  Mara's supposed Swedish accent is comically bad and her acting is horrendously awful.  She's totally one-note and gives zero depth, emotion or humanity to the Lisbeth character.  Mara's performance made Lisbeth both boring and unlikable.  A terrible casting choice for the remake.  And Nyqvist owns the role of Blomkvist compared to Craig as well, again no comparison.  This American remake is far more plodding and boring, and less intriguing, less suspenseful and less intense than the original Swedish version.  Major, major let down.  Expected a far better remake from the usually outstanding director David Fincher, but Fincher seems to have sleptwalked through the directing of this one.  You can tell his heart just was not in this remake at all.  And the cinematography and editing are subpar as well.  Case in point, there are virtually NO meaningful close-ups of the Lisbeth character (Mara) that last more than a second, the DP and editor keep her at a distance from the viewer so no bond is ever formed between the Lisbeth character and the viewer.  But then again, Mara's acting is so bad and she's so wrong for the role, maybe it's a moot point.  Can't even recommend this poorly done remake as a rental.  Suggest watching the original Swedish version only... As far as the poor packaging, I must echo about a dozen other 1-star reviewers here who pointed out the subpar ""look"" of this DVD... it DOES NOT look like a professional quality-made DVD like a trusting buyer would reasonably expect to get, no, it appears to be a blank DVD-R that has apparently been ""burned"" on some apparently low-end duplication machine with the title (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) actually hand-written (scribbled) on the DVD-R in black magic marker.  At first I found it confusing that this low-end ""bootleg"" quality looking DVD was being sold by a major studio.  I pay for professionally-produced DVDs, not bootleg-level ones.  But now, after investigating the situation online, it appears Sony/Columbia intentionally made the DVD look like a ""pirated""-quality DVD for, well, who knows why...  Because Lisbeth is a hacker... ?  Bad idea.  Bottom line is the DVD looks bad and that bums me out.  I don't care why Sony/Fincher/whoever did it, I want a DVD I buy to look like a professional DVD and not pirated junk.  And on top of the bad looking DVD, the one I bought ""froze"" up twice while playing it.  So looks bad and plays bad.

PLOT:
  A journalist (Daniel Craig) is hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance of the man's niece forty years ago under the pretense of writing his biography. As the case unfolds, he decides to enlist the aid of a computer hacker (Rooney Mara) to assist in gathering more information.

4225629,2,B003Y5H5HO,"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 2011 film

The movie begins with a telephone call about a package in the mail. Then the credits roll with music and graphics. A journalist lost a libel suit. [Sloppy research?] Mikal smokes cigarettes [another flaw?] We see Salander the investigator for a businessman who does her research on the Internet. Lisbeth reports on Mikal. Blomkvist gets a telephone call from a lawyer representing Henrik Vanger, who wants to see him at Hedestad. He would research contemptible people - Vanger's family. Can he also solve the disappearance of Harriet Vanger from forty years ago? Vanger offers him proof of Wennerstrm's guilt. Mikal will write Vanger's biography, and learns about his relatives living on this island. There are some silent scenes.

There is a notebook with 5-digit telephone numbers. Salander is questioned about her work (she has a legal guardian because of her past). She must keep a budget and receipts. Mikal visits a couple for dinner and talks about the past. Elsewhere a thief in the subway tries to steal Lisbeth's bag. Cecilia talks to Mikal about the family. Lisbeth answers questions about her personal life - its regulations. She gets a check after this interview. Mikal flies to London to see Anita and talk about Harriet. Lisbeth visits her guardian at his home. She gets a surprise! [These scenes will not be shown on TV.] Vanger offers to support the `Millenium' magazine. [Do you know how many magazines operate like this?] Mikal looks at old photos. Lisbeth bought a stun gun (are they legal there?). She gets her revenge and a free hand from her lawyer-guardian. Is she insane?

Mikal finds something in those old negatives. A chance comment sends him to read Leviticus and its punishment for sinners. Mikal wants a background investigation and meets Lisbeth at her place. He wants help in finding a killer of women. She agrees and does her research. Mikal meets the Vanger family. Lisbeth tells Mikal of her solution to the murders. Is the dead cat a threat? Mikal talks to a widow about her old pictures. Someone takes a shot at Mikal when he is outside. Lisbeth comforts Mikal that night. Mikal wants to inspect old company records, Lisbeth also helps. [Why does a business keep old paper records?] Mikal talks to an old man. Lisbeth correlates a schedule to the murders. [The silent scenes are hard to follow.]

Mikal interviews Martin, and is lead to a basement room! The conversation reveals the guilty man, who talks freely about his crimes. Lisbeth arrives just in time to save Mikal. She chases the fleeing murderer who crashes his car. The leaking gasoline explodes, the driver is burned alive (like some medieval punishment). Lisbeth tells her past to Mikal. Martin denied killing Harriet; could she still be alive? They visit Anita in London, who tells them about her past. The mystery is solved, Harriet returns to speak to Henrik Vanger. Lisbeth tells Mikal the secrets of Wennerstrm's past; this time the charges will stick. Lisbeth borrows 50,000 for her work. She will repay it as she has the passwords to transfer funds from Wennerstrm's banking accounts. Wennerstrm is now a hunted man without the money to buy his way out. He is bumped off by his former business associates. Lisbeth returns to her past.

This film toned down the original story and improved the character of Lisbeth. It has repulsive characters and some X-rated scenes. This story echoes ""The Big Sleep"", ""Chinatown"", and ""Roseanna"". Can you believe a serial killer living in an isolated location? Most serial killers seek areas with a large transient population for victims.

So I was excited to share the movie with my boyfriend via Amazon Instant Watch....until I discovered that Amazon removed some content.  It isn't a lot of content, but enough to be noticeable.  Specifically, they've removed the sex scene after Lisbeth meets up with a woman at a bar and takes her home.  In the version I saw on the big screen, there is a fairly explicit sex scene between the two women.  This is completely edited out of the Amazon Instant Watch video.  Now, some could think I'm complaining simply because it's a sex scene, but I feel that the scene is important because it shows that Lisbeth is not always a difficult, anti-social woman.  It shows that she does have the capacity to make connections with people far before she makes one with Blomkvist.  I'm very disappointed that Amazon would edit out any content from movies or TV that they stream.

Hollywood is going to ruin another perfectly good story just to make a few bucks'. I couldn't see Daniel Craig as Blomvkiwtz frankly. I thought he did not make a good Bond so how in the world could he pull off Blomvkiwtz!!
Hollywood tends to take stories and change them to appeal to a targeted audience who likes to see the plot and its characters fit into a narrowly defined category.
I was wrong, wrong, wrong.
Daniel Craigs portrayal of Blomvkiwz was amazing, on Par with the Michael Nygvists portral and in many respects the script written for Craig was truer to the nature and personality of Blomkvist than the Swedish film.
Hollywood was also more faithful too the Novel. Staying very close to the book and responsibly makikng minor changes to the plot and characters to avoid having to film a mini series. Bravo
I need to mention only one minor exception that was easily overcome by the acting of Rooney Mara (Lizbeth). In the first novel and the second novel a great deal of attention is drawn to the size of Lizbeths breast, which were abnormally small. Rooney Mara has very nice breast, well shaped and natural looking. They did not fit the character of the withdrawn Lizbeth, but Rooney made up for it by nailing the portrayal of Lizbeth as if she was Lizbeth. Startlingly I thought she did a better job of it than Noomi Rapace who played Lizbeth in the Swedish version. Rapace's breast were unusually small and she had the stature and facial structure similar to the character described by Stieg Larson. But in the Girl that played with fire her breast did not change as they did in the Novel due to plastic surgery.
I would highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a fan of the novels and the Swedish films of the novel.",1341964800,,1927,4.540229885057471

Her transformation is astounding and she made that role her own.  I haven't read the books and I am still debating if I will or not, but  I did enjoy the film a lot, especially Rooney Mara's acting. I haven't seen the Swedish version yet but  judging from the  online comments I've read the film ( American version) was not so well received in Europe. It seems a lot of Europeans are angered by the emotional attachment portrayed in the film between Lisbeth and Daniel Craig's character.  This is one of the aspects that I liked about the film, the attachment she develops for Daniel Craig's character shows that underneath that harsh exterior and despite the very hard life this girl has had to endure she is not as mentally ""impaired""  as they claim  her to be and it's beyond me how some people say Mara's character was ""fluffed"" up  in the  American version.  It shows that she is vulnerable and most of all it shows that she is human and is still able to care for people despite all the odds and tribulations life has given her.  Rachel McAdams, Jennifer Aniston, Amanda Seyfried and the likes of them are truly bad actresses IMO that never reach beyond the silly melodrama that are Hollywood ""romantic"" comedies.  Mara proved in this film that she has range and  is able to transform herself for  any role. I can only hope she doesn't get type cast or worst begins to work in stupid mindless Hollywood movies. Only two scenes keep me from loving this film, the scene in the office with her disgusting pig of a  ""guardian"" and the very disturbing rape scene.

It is virtually scene for scene the same as the original, and the quality of the film used, sound, and lighting even feel the same, if not worse.  The only thing they did was bring in bigger actors, namely Daniel Craig, Stellan Skarsgard, Christopher Plummer to name a few, then made them speak English with an accent to make it sound Swedish to apparently make it more appealing for the US audience.  Also had a bigger budget, but all they spent it on was actors and trent rezonor to do the soundtrack, just superfluous spending that added nothing for me.  Really no need to do so.

Disgraced and broke, he accepts a private investigation job offered by Henrik Vanger, an elderly industrialist who would like to resolve the 40-year-old mystery of his murdered niece Harriet in the Swedish hinterlands up north. The list of suspects, Blomkvist is told, includes several members of Vanger's dysfunctional family, eccentric fascists and Nazis still living within walking distance from his manor.

Obviously, as Blomkvist gets closer to the truth, his life becomes more endangered. Juxtaposed with Blomkvist's investigation is Lisbeth's unenviable existence back in Stockholm. Having just compiled an extensive background check on Blomkvist for Vanger, she has just been appointed a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, due to her state-declared mental incompetency. Bjurman abuses his authority by forcibly raping her. Lisbeth eventually regains control of her life by blackmailing him in the most degrading manner possible, an act of revenge both horrifying and satisfying. Blomkvist decides to hire Lisbeth to help him uncover the connection between a cryptic message written in a notebook and a series of murders that occurred from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s. The labyrinth plot escalates into a series of increasingly revealing connections between Harriet's disappearance and the entire Vanger dynasty, in particular, Harriet's brother Martin, now the CEO of the Vanger Corporation, and their estranged sister Anita, living in London with no desire to reunite with what remains of her family in Sweden.

At the same time, Lisbeth and Blomkvist become romantically involved, which naturally brings its own set of complications but also provides the impetus for a final act of revenge. I assume screenwriter Steve Zaillian's adaptation of the source novel remains faithful, but just as important, he manages to present an elaborately plotted thriller with most of the necessary details presented intact. Fincher does an impressive job propelling this complicated story with dazzling cinematic technique and handles the more lurid moments with the same professional ease he displayed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Se7en/dp/B00464F19Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Se7en</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zodiac/dp/B000VK7KVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zodiac</a>. However, the meticulous emphasis on procedure sometimes disinfects the movie to the point of making the principals feel more like plot devices racing toward the resolution. At certain points, the plot developments feel as cold as the wintry Scandinavian setting. Despite this tonal discord, the cast works effectively within the story's convolutions and conventions. Even with a variable Swedish accent, Daniel Craig is able to submerge his cool Bond persona just enough to play the wry, middle-aged investigative reporter in a compellingly human manner.

Christopher Plummer as Vanger, Joely Richardson as Anita, and Robin Wright as Blomkvist's married editor Erika all play their roles with precise authority and surprisingly convincing Swedish accents. In more challenging roles, Yorick van Wageningen as Lisbeth's abusive guardian and Stellan Skarsgrd as Martin are even better. However, it's Rooney Mara (Mark Zuckerberg's scabrous girlfriend in the opening scene of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Social-Network/dp/B004HWT6DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Social Network</a>) who really gives the movie both its mystique and emotional wallop. With pale eyebrows, shapeless clothing, and awkward manner, Mara's Lisbeth concurrently craves attention and deflects it with almost every movement. The actress makes her character's savant skills and photographic memory perfectly believable and most of all, makes Lisbeth's seeming passivity quietly heartbreaking with a modicum of expression. It's a superb, star-making performance. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth deserves mention for capturing the severity of the chilled images needed to convey the story, while the original music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross provides an appropriately haunting undercurrent.",1341446400,3,5265,6.705710102489019

4225679,2,B003Y5H5HO,"For those of you who have been out of the loop re the Millennium series recently, it was announced as far back as January 2010 that Fincher would be attached to the American Dragon Tattoo film. This sparked a mixed reaction, from people who even love Fincher like there's no tomorrow. Well, it looks like people are still high off their wankery over The Social Network, another mediocre and spectacularly overrated movie. So it seems obvious the circle jerk would continue in the wake of the recent Dragon Tattoo adaptation.

Problem is, there seems to be Two David Finchers. The one who made amazing movies Like Se7en, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and The Zodiac. Then there's the Fincher who gave us the horrid Benjamin Button, the overrated above mentioned Social Network, and now this.

Thing is, I for one wasn't too opposed the idea of an English language adaptation. I mean, sure it wouldn't be as authentic as the original Swedish version, nor the book. But it could still work. Craig still had the face and Mara has very striking facial features. Reznor has a unique way of scoring a film, and Fincher has a great eye for a shot, hell, he practically made a whole career our of that kind of thing.

Unfortunately, the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the Swedish movie. And here's why.

The Swedish movie does a good job at staying close to the source material, however, it doesn't just mindlessly piggyback off of the source material- it perfectly balanced everything out. Those who haven't read the book would be able to follow it and find it entertaining. It took its time too- it had a nice, steady, easy going pace. It was 2.5 hours, but the movie was so interesting, it went by fast and you couldn't tell.

The Yank version is pretty much an exact adaptation of the book, yes. Pretty much 98% of the book was in the movie. That's NOT a good thing; to me it came off as nothing more than desperate to please the fans. It was like Zallian said ""Alright, we have to mindlessly piggyback the book. I'm super scared of pissing the fans off, and so let's not edit anything down. There is no such thing as 'What may work on page doesn't necessarily work on film.'"". Except... there is.

Let me explain why.

Niels' film showed RESTRAINT and SUBTLETY, the two things this film lacked. It focused more on the characters than every single tiny little plot device of the book. This film felt rushed and blew its way through everything. For example, the opening scene. In Niels' film, it's very powerful. The way he looks at the plant then breaks down is simply... stunning. Here? We got a half assed phone call and a shot of the plant.

The opening credits, however, are class. Pointless, overly flashy and a bit gimmicky? Yes, but class, and the images fit very nicely over the Immigrant Song. I loved the shout outs to the sequels too.

Unfortunately it stops there, the writer Zallian is so obsessed with capturing every event that he senselessly skips over CHARACTER DETAILS!!!!! We get no hint to the fact that Lisbeth is possibly autistic. Instead we get a scenery chewing girl who we want to punch in the face every time we see her. The whole libel thing goes over our heads completely too.

And that's just the beginning.

Several of the scenes are over before they even begin. It's frustrating. The rape scene was underwhelming even. In the book it was a disturbing and powerful scene. Here it's just a ""lol wut"" moment.

As for the acting. Noomi Rapace simply cannot be replaced. She played Lisbeth exactly how the books describe her. Tough as nails, arrogant, and dangerous to herself, but with an air of special childlike innocence. Mara? She confuses good acting for chewing the scenery. She always glares and says every line like someone asked her the square root of an insanely large number. Nyqvist not only played Blomkvist just like Larsson wrote him, but he also LOOKED like the book described. Here, Craig just seems to be stuck in his Bond phase. Nothing special whatsoever.

Also, for parts 2 and 3, someone needs to hire a better dialect coach. I lost count of all the times they went from American to British to a Europeanoid accent. What a joke.

I wish I could recommend this, but it's a big mess. Avoid if you haven't watched the Swedish and just watch that instead.

4225680,4,B003Y5H5HO,"Steven Zaillian wrote a superb screenplay and David Fincher did a great job of directing this improvement over the original English dubbed, Swedish film adaptation of the TV series.  Unlike the Swedish film, this was much easier to watch and understand as the story followed the book more closley and was allowed to flow more effortlessly. Daniel Criag looked comfortable and credible as Mikael Blomkvist and Rooney Mara gave a powerful and moving interpretation of Lisbeth Salander. Rooney had big shoes to fill after the incredible performance by Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version of this movie, but she certainly proved herself to be up to the task.  I have this uncomfortable feeling, after watching the Swedish film, that Noomi Rapace is, in fact, Lisbeth Salander.

If you love this story, and the book, as much as I do, you owe it to yourself to see both of the movie interpretations.

I only became intrigued when I saw the Daniel Craig version advertised on TV. I never had time to see it at the movies, so I have been waiting for it to come to pay-per-view or HBO. In the meantime, BluRay disc player and Netflix and Amazon happenned. I noticed it on Netflix first, thought it was the American version, and instead started watching the original Swedish movie. I was hooked. On Netflix I watched the three original extended movies, all 9 hours of them. Then I took the audio books out of the library, and listened so far to 35 of the 44 CD's. Then I watched this American version with Daniel Craig. Right from the credits, with extreme oily CGI graphics and ear-splitting Led Zeppelin music from 40 years ago I knew there was trouble. Almost nothing in this American version works. Somehow they drained the life out of this amazing story. All of the actors are miscast, the soundtrack is awful, the settings are wrong, and the story is re-written so confusingly that even I couldn't make sense of it, and I already know the story. Some of my immediate pet peeves are non-Swedish actors playing non-Swedish characters in a Swedish story set in Sweden. A soundtrack that employs annoying buzzing and droning sounds that obscure the dialogue. Photographs and scenes that aren't even nearly as beautiful as the Swedish version. Changing the ending so that it is not like the book, not like the Swedish film, and worse than both. Changing the main chemistry between the two main characters which is the focal point of the story. The Amazon instant-view video that I watched on my Vizio TV thru my Vizio BluRay disc player developed a glitch near the end, which looked like slight slo-motion. It ruined the experience. All 9 hours of the Swedish films played flawlessly thru Netflix. To sum up... I feel bad that some people will watch this American version and turn off to a great story. The original book is highly textured, and even though it is extremely detailed and wordy, the detail is interesting. I recommend seeing the Swedish film first ( even the whole 9 hours of the extended Swedish films), then read or listen to the book(s). Then watch the Swedish films again. There is detail within detail, even more and better than something like LordOfTheRings. The Swedish actors will help you picture the characters, places, and history. If you watch the subtitled movies, you get to hear the actors voices and the wonderful sound of the language.

4225716,3,B003Y5H5HO,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

On the surface, the American version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' directed by David Fincher, has a lot going for it. Despite the slow exposition, the story picks up when Daniel Craig as journalist-investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, is hired by Swedish magnate, Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the mystery of the disappearance of Vanger's beloved niece, Harriet, who vanished from the family compound forty years earlier in 1966.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the film is how Blomkvist, with the assistance of Goth-like computer hacker, Lisbeth Salander, partially solves the mystery, mainly by discovering clues buried in old photos taken at the time of Harriet's disappearance. One is reminded of Antonioni's 1966 film 'Blowup', which was released in the same year the murder mystery in 'Tattoo' is supposed to take place.

There are other well done scenes in 'Tattoo', particularly the harrowing rape scenes where Lisbeth is violated by her court appointed guardian and later when she turns the tables on him, an example of vigilante justice. Equally as gripping is when Blomkvist is imprisoned by Vanger's serial-killer nephew, Martin, who tortures the journalist but is saved by Salander, who arrives in the nick of time.

The acting is mostly excellent, including Rooney Mara, who plays the glum, rebellious 'damaged goods' ward of the state, with aplomb as well as the always solid Christopher Plummer. The bad guys are equally as menacing--only Daniel Craig, seems out of place, as he doesn't seem like he's from Scandinavia. To be fair to Craig, the script saddles him with a rather deadpan part, with Blomkvist the least interesting of the principal players. One unfortunate shortcoming in the Hollywood version is that there's mention of a number of characters with a 'Nazi' past, but the nature of that connection is never explored in any detail whatsoever.

Despite a thriller that keeps one's interest to the end, nagging questions remain which tend to lessen the film's overall impact. For starters, we find out little about the nature of the lawsuit, which Blomkvist loses at the beginning of the film. Why is the crooked businessmen, Wennerstr&ouml;m, so evil? Vanger seems to think so, and promises to give Blomkvist the evidence once he completes his assignment. But Blomkvist tells Vanger at film's end that the 'evidence' is meaningless and we never find out what it's about. I realize that in a film such as this, which is already quite long, the scenarists don't really have a lot of time to explain all the, but still, the reason why the whole story is put in motion is principally due to the main character losing this lawsuit. And when Lisbeth hacks into Wennerstr&ouml;m's computers and steals all his millions, do we really care? And do we really care when he's murdered? In reality, Wennerstr&ouml;m is really a cypher of a character.

I also wonder why Vanger hires Blomkvist in the first place. Wouldn't he have done better to have hired a private investigator or someone involved closer to law enforcement? I realize Blomkvist is an investigative reporter but he's also the co-owner of a hip magazine--hardly the type of person to take on such an assignment. Yes, of course, he's just lost his life savings and he's desperate but the entire arrangements seems a bit odd. There's also the issue of Blomkvist's competency--he's just lost that lawsuit and even though Vanger likes the idea that he opposed Wennerstr&ouml;m (who's a long term rival), the fact that he made accusations without proof, wouldn't have impressed a real life Vanger, who would have probably gone for someone whose past, in contrast, was squeaky clean.

Even if one is willing to suspend one's disbelief regarding Blomkvist taking on Vanger's proposal, the whole idea that the brilliant Lisbeth would allow herself to fall into her evil guardian's clutches more than once, seems pretty incredible. Just like Blomkvist, who stupidly ""miscalculated"" about the lawsuit, Lisbeth admits to misjudging just how sick (as she puts it) Guardian Bjurman really is. And what about Lisbeth running out of money? Wasn't she paid a fair amount by Vanger to investigate Blomkvist before he hires him? You would have thought she would have had some money left over to the buy that new computer. And since she's so clever, why couldn't she just go out and get another freelance assignment to pay the bills, instead of relying on her pervert guardian? If she's smart enough to steal three billion dollars from a mega-rich businessmen, couldn't she have hacked into a lesser fry criminal early on, put a few bucks into her account, and avoided being dependent on Bjurman?

Regarding Lisbeth, there were a couple of other things that seemed a little 'too easy'--for example, Martin forgetting to lock the doors behind him when he went downstairs to torture Blomkvist. Lisbeth just walks right into the house (no alarm is triggered to warn hi-tech guru, Martin) and she then all too easily slips into Martin's torture chamber and saves Blomkvist from a horrible death. And wasn't it sort of a little too easy for Lisbeth, to hack into Wennerstr&ouml;m's accounts? But this is Hollywood, so anything can happen, no?

Finally, I was curious about Vanger's assumption that Harriet had been murdered. He states that Harriet couldn't have gotten off the island since none of the boats had been used and the police had prevented everyone from leaving. But the next day, the police relented...SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD...and that's exactly how Harriet escaped--in the trunk of her cousin Anita's car, who had helped her. Why didn't this scenario occur to Vanger? Had he followed through on such an assumption, of course there would have been no movie!

If you're not too picky about Tattoo's contrivances, you may find yourself enjoying this tale of suspense. For more critical and/or discerning viewers, you may end up with the conclusion that this is by no means a masterpiece.",1339286400,,6029,5.050251256281407

4225745,3,B003Y5H5HO,I ordered this movie having seen it in the theater and wanted a copy to watch at home. I like the additional features and additional picture quality of Blu-Ray.

This must have been a returned product but sold to me as new. I did not return it since I really just wanted the Blu-Ray copy and didn't want the hassle.

4225746,5,B003Y5H5HO,"If you read the book this movie is based on, you might have wondered how they would capture the complexity of the story, the edgy, murky atmosphere and the villainy of the crime.  This movie accomplished all three to my sense.
It was as good as the book and brought the story and its extreme characters to life. I relished Rooney Mara as Salander and Craig as the journalist.  The pace suited the story and the frames captured the bleak tones and sense of foreboding.  Outstanding movie--it enhanced the book for me.

When our library mystery group read this mystery for its monthly selection we discussed the strengths of the book: original plot, crisp writing, contemporary issues, fabulous setting etc. but other mystery series have these.

What made this book and movie so popular?

Listening to the other participants talk it came back to one dynamic: Lisabeth Salander

She's a modern-day super-hero. Her acumen and facility with computers is so agile, it seems she can do anything, overcome any obstacle, and get back at the bad guys. She fascinates us. We root for her. She's emotionally vulnerable but invincible at the same time. Most of us have never met anyone like her, but you can't help but like her. And she is on a heroes journey of becoming whole again, learning to figure out where she fits in and what her purpose is. Her immediate purpose is to overcome a series of obstacles and help to solve a missing person mystery. This is a central conflict that is, as my writing-lit instructor Adam would say, is ""personal, concrete and specific"". Will she and the journalist be successful? This is one reason why you keep turning the pages and watching the movie, but the other reason is that you want to see Lisabeth work to the height of her potential as she is so unique.

She carries this plot--take her out and this is like many other outstanding, well-conceived mystery. With her in the story, it stands apart.

In this movie the violence and sex was overly-graphic for my taste, but I was willing to put up with it to see what Lisabeth would do next.",1338422400,2,2070,4.64931506849315

4225772,1,B003Y5H5HO,"As a huge fan of the Swedish version of this film and its sequels, I was reluctant to watch the American version.  I'm cynical about the business side of American entertainment and saw this as a common move to cash in on a proven product.  On the other hand, I have seen the Swedish trilogy several times and read the books, so I was curious about this version. That said, on the recommendation of my son, who is a film aficionado and enjoys Fincher's work, I decided to stream it from Amazon.  I knew I might be in trouble from the opening credits, which were flowing CGI objects moving to a Led Zeppelin song--I should say at this point that in general the music was totally inappropriate throughout the entire film.  My overall impression--and I did stick it out to the end--was that the screenwriters took the original screen play and went through it with a highlighter identifying the sections to keep, while deleting the enriching detail, the nuance, the story telling and character building that made the Swedish version so amazing.  This movie was so THIN that if I hadn't been  familiar with the story, I would have been lost.  Deep narrative arcs and links to the the overall story were replaced with 2 minutes of explanatory hand-holding  We are never asked to think, to immerse ourselves into the characters in order to understand their emotions, and thus why they are doing what they are doing--other than the most obvious.  The audience is assumed to need clearly enunciated bullet lists of events and a timeline to understand past events--at least that's how we are treated.  Imagine ""Mad Men"", ""Downton Abbey"" or ""Game of Thrones"" told in 12 minute episodes with conveniently placed charts and photos and you may get my meaning.  And finally it was so emotionally empty that there was really no reason why any of the characters should connect to each other--i.e. two dimensional figures have a hard time connecting in a 4 dimensional world.  None of the relationships seem REAL because the characters don't spend enough time on-screen together--the breadth of familial corruption and evil isn't developed, the depth of frustration and loss that Henrik must have felt isn't portrayed, the long standing bond between Blomkvist and Erika, and the motivation for the temporary bond between Lisbeth and Kalle.  So there you are--another American film where celebrities land big roles, get a lot of press in the entertainment media (to its financial gain too) and basically walk through the role.  If you haven't seed the Sweedish versions, do so, and then as an experiment, watch this one.

Most of the time I find the original first ones(european) better than the american ones....
But maybe the mainstream audience is not used to the different pace of european (or also asian)movies.
Of course that might also have to do with the foreign language and the subtitles.
It's just easier to see a movie in your own language....
The acting here was decent but not as good as from the swedish actors I thought.
Daniel Graig is not a Blomquist.
And the girl was also a bit flat in her dynamic I felt.

I think the main actress is better looking in the euro version. On the otherhand, daniel craig is better looking than Michael Nyqvist.

The story is ok, but I think a little more explanation would help the audience follow the plot. A few times the movie would show some clues and then the actor's face lit up like he/she noticed something. OK, what? Sometimes it is explained later and sometimes not.

4225817,4,B003Y5H5HO,"There are a lot of reviews here, much to read or consider.
If you think that watching a new level of graphicly-bloody,-sexual violence  against women, or any victim in this sort of crime,- is part of a great movie, then skip this, because ""its a SPOILER.""
After watching this movie I wish I saw a MUCH MORE CONCISE warning, any spoiler effect would have been greatly appreciated. I wish the warning said:
""This movie contains violent, bloody, life-threatening torturous rape. The scenes are at a level that will be shocking to most observers. (based on comments by those who did not read the book, and were asked if the movie was 'cool' or 'intense' or had parts that were disturbing, etc., etc.)
The screams alone are so difficult to hear. The most violent level of rape is enough to cause a physical revulsion not exactly common in R-rated movies to date.. I think I am not alone.  Gratuitous sex is a silly matter, after you see this horrid level of violence.
A warning of 'Rape and Murder"" means little, after you must observe torture like this.
Also I would like to have been offered,
-""If you wish to SKIP this 'segment' of the movie, the actual minutes of this murderous-level of rape run From __?_(minute-time) To __?__Minute-time, should be avoided.
I am sorry, but I did not write down which minutes are the horrid minutes involved. I could not go back to look again. As it began, I turned the volume off, tried to not look, letting silent tape run, and waited for it to end, and waited, for the ACTUAL MOVIE to continue.
(This murder by rape easily 'could' result in a horribly, drawn-out death).
For once, I think a squealer is not a bad thing, not here.
I realize, that I am probably asking someone who is doubltless paid only to SELL THE MOVIE. That is not relevant to their 'title' or job description. The ""R- Rating' is a watered-down rating here. This is alone in its own, NEW field of vile violence.
Angelina Jolie's incredible movie touched down on sex-crime violence, this one slams into it. I am pretty sure Dragon Tattoo, takes the 'gone way past what we need to see' {SICK PRIZE}.
The drawn-out scene takes viewers into the highly illegal sextrade level of cruelty, where MURDER BY RAPE is sold on dvd's, to sell to the few who want to see this, and the victim indeed does- die.
Is that what movie watchers expect or want? I think not.  I pray not.
I truly doubt any one signs on to see this crap, and recall, many have NOT read the book. Many read the hype and don't see this crap coming.
Maybe this type of torture is a 'common form of rape,'  but I have only heard of this level of violence.
Still the movie does a tremendous job of drawing out WHAT RAPE REALLY IS.  If anyone can allow themselves to recall the horror they 'get' to observe here. Yes, maybe, rape will be taken more seriously by the many sharp viewers, and someday the punishment will meet the horrors of such crime.
Stiil, I have a beyond-vivid imagination and know enough-without pictures, enactment. The whole drawn out rage and destruction enforced against a female, or any victim of violent sex crime. The victim is instantly an obvious survivor, from the start of the movie.  We know something really bad has happened to her. We care deeply for her, its immediate. But, this drawn-out nauseating offense is just not integral to the movie. Maybe the younger crowd will show their bravery by discussing it. That is what may be 'hip.'
But I hope all viewers are sickened and horrified, as we are humans, we have too much humanity to want to sit thru this. Its not an thrill ride for me. Its far beyond, and below, horrid.
50 million copies sold, in 48 countries.  How many loved reading it? Most, and I think I would.  How many looked forward to SEEING that scene?  Maybe some, in small doses.
I wonder how many wanted this sent to be SEEN,  by unknown viewers, all over the world?  - For ALL ages to 'stumble into.' - We know that Ratings don't protect young people.  We do, or we try to.  We don't succeed always.
Our votes for what is ok to include, still can be spoken out,-for, or against. Freedom (artistic, like this) can hurt our young people, and the rest of us too. Its a big world, many opionions.

4225892,1,B003Y5H5HO,"I am currently half way through the second book in this trilogy and decided to watch this movie because I liked what I have read so far.

I am not griping because this movie doesn't adhere well to the book. I KNOW that movies can't always follow the book and sometimes it's better to rewrite stuff to make it better for a movie.  I like to watch movies based on books as if they were not and judge them as stand-alone stories, ya know?  That said...

1) I think it spoiled the second book for me which I'm only half way done with. In the second book, ""all the evil that happened"" is a big mystery, and unfortunately, I think Lisbeth spilled the beans about what ""all the evil is"" at the end of this movie.  I was really upset that the makers of this movie did that.  She is supposed to be painfully private and she reveals a secret to Mikeal so willingly that it's like the writer's just gave up trying to capture the essence of who she is. She would have never talked about her past like that. Ever. Not even to Mikeal, and especially not so soon after knowing him. I understand movies have to be different than the books, but that was ridiculous. But the fact that I think this movie reveals something that is a mystery in the second book really pisses me off. After I finish the second book, I'll come back and tell you what I think.

2) Um, editing and sound quality suck. We watched HD and it still sucked. If we didn't already know what was supposed to be going on, we'd have been totally lost. We couldn't understand what they were saying half the time because they were mumbling and muffled and there was too much background noise/music.

3) Way too many montages where they are researching. I know that's a big deal in the story, but come on, I don't want to sit and watch 30 minutes straight of artsy-filmed research montages where it's not even clear what they are researching.",1336694400,4,1888,4.328611898016997
4225893,4,B003Y5H5HO,"His father was a drinker
And his mother cried in bed
Folding John Wayne's t-shirts
When the swingset hit his head

Based on Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is decidedly David Fincher's best film, and decidedly his most morally thematic. The story follows a disgraced journalist named Mikael (Daniel Craig) who is hired by an old Swedish patriarch to uncover an unsolved murder that has festered away for over 40 years. In over his head, Mikael brings aboard a computer specialist and muckraker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). Together, they begin to unravel a family tapestry of deceit, ambiguity and the nature of radical depravity.

The neighbors they adored him
For his humor and his conversation
Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things, rotting fast, in their sleep
Oh, the dead

Filled with gloomy shots that evoke living shadows and naked corridors, TGWTDT is both haunting and cold, not unlike most of Fincher's work. The constant tension of rain and snow and cold contributes to the overall gentle horror that the narrative conjures up. Dealing especially with sexuality and the abuse of it, Fincher and writer Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) spare no expense in showcasing extreme brutality. The much-talked about rape scene never cuts away through much of the act, but the subsequent fallout of physical degradation experienced by the character truly doesn't blink. While I'm not convinced that showcasing the entire forced sexual act was necessary, it does paint a painful and gut-wrenching aftermath of emotional and physical turmoil. Frankly, I'm not certain about if it was justified, so I will simply leave my concerns right where they lay.

Twenty-seven people
Even more, they were boys
With their cars, summer jobs
Oh my God
Are you one of them?

He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed
He kissed them all

Though bolstered by a solid performance by Daniel Craig, Rooney Mara inhabits Lisbeth like a second skin. This is her show, and she commands every scene she is in. She is a woman who is in tight control of herself, but when she slips, it is truly apocalyptic. Her retributive encounter with a rapist is as brutal as the rape scene itself, but is ambiguous in the sense of whether or not her vengeance fulfills. I'm inclined to see it not as a feminist retaliation, which is likely what the authors and filmmakers intended, but as a very human response and a desire for control. Of course, they could be the same thing. As those who control her did awful things, so must she do everything she can to regain said control. Like I said, Fincher thrives on ambiguity and the film feels slightly scattered because of it. This is more than likely a personal objection rather than an objective one, but I felt like noting it.

He'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand
Running far, running fast to the dead
He took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips
Quiet hands, quiet kiss on the mouth

It needn't be repeated that TGWTDT is not for the faint of heart. The film is darker than most of the film's I've sat through, and I would not recommend this to most of my friends. On a purely technical basis, this film is flawless. The storytelling is compact, with only scattered instances of exposition, and the imagery is simultaneously harsh and haunting. I'm predicting several nominations, among them Best Actress and Director.

The biggest flaw seems to be the ending, which is almost too quiet for it's own good. It seems as if Fincher wanted to keep the ambiguity, but in the end, it felt anti-climactic. This does not derail the film, but it feels forced. Perhaps this is simply realism. Perhaps this is in keeping with Fincher's worldview.

Perhaps this simply is what it is.

And in my best behavior
I am really just like him
Look beneath the floor boards
For the secrets I have hid

Maybe that is the best and worst thing about this film - in illuminating the darkest parts of humanity's soul, it never blinks. It continues to stare and gape and shiver along with the coldest settlements on humanity's depraved encampment. It never blinks.

And it dares us to do so.

4225894,5,B003Y5H5HO,I read this series last summer and it was one of those books you could not put down. If you saw the movie but have not read the book...read the book.  The books have so much more than the movie.  This is a thriller book. Lots of action.  You have to get through the first few chapters and get over all the names and locations (based in Sweden) to really get to the good stuff.,1336608000,,376,3.986666666666667
4225895,1,B003Y5H5HO,"All of the actors and actresses in this production are excellent, BUT the movie is a waste of time and money (yours and the producers).  The rewrite is not well thought-out.  I would recommend the European collection of all three books/movies (One may purchase it in a 4-disk set and the additional material is as well done as any additional production material I've seen on an accompanying disk).

I'd read all three books before seeing the three original films, and the compromises are small and not disconcerting (like the changes in the American version to Rooney Mara's personality and belief system. They are senseless and compromise the performance of a very talented actress). I also can't believe that Daniel Craig agreed to have his name associated with the American version.

Sorry for the rant, but I liked the books and Swedish movies a great deal.  A ""1"" rating is really harsh. I just read today that it means ""hate,"" but there's no one-and-a-half rating.  My opinion wouldn't have changed, but I personally would have felt a little better.  That's the American way, eh', ;}",1336608000,4,1089,4.885869565217392

It the Hollywood version he comes swaggering in like a cowboy, Salander would have hated him and the rest of the story would have never happened.  This is just the most obvious example.

4225932,5,B003Y5H5HO,"At first I was reluctant to see this adaptation of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, as I'd read many accounts stating that it did not live up to its Swedish predecessor (which I've never seen). Having preferred the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice over the recent film adaptation (starring Keira Knightley), I sympathize with those loyal to the Swedish version of Dragon, since oftentimes one favors whatever adaptation one has seen first. However, I greatly enjoyed David Fincher's version. As is usually the case in his films, the pacing was excellent, and of course the visuals were gorgeous, even in their grittiness. The film nicely summed up a lot of plot points which I felt dragged on needlessly in the book, and basically cut out a lot of the dead weight. I actually prefer the film over the book, which is a rarity for me. But what really won me over was Rooney Mara's portrayal of Lisbeth. She was the Lisbeth I'd envisioned when I read the book. While I can understand other viewers' loyalty to the Swedish version (particularly Swedes!), I personally found Fincher's version to be brilliant in its own right.

It was, simply put, brilliant. When I heard that there was to be an American version and Daniel Craig, with his incredible acting talent, was cast as the investigative reporter, Mikael Blomkvist, I thought I would naturally love the film. True to form, though I loved Michael Nyqvist's adaptation of this character, Mr. Craig did a wonderful job. In my opinion, the major stumbling block was attempting to replace Noomi Rapace in the part of Lisbeth Salander. While watching the American version, I simply could not get past the inability of Rooney Mara to ""eat up"" the role as Lisbeth as Noomi did. Noomi Rapace was meant for this role and it was a serious casting misstep in trying to replace her. As for the film as a whole it was good, but it didn't make me feel the intense emotions I felt with Director Niels Arden Oplev's vision.

All that being said, Daniel Craig was great in this version and the film was still utterly fascinating...even though, having seen all three other movies and read the books, I knew what was coming.

The changes made from the original version to this one actually tightened up the movie some and made it less slow in places.  Still, it retained the chilling edge and mystery, as well as the shock value, of the story as it is unraveled.  It is beautifully filmed, which makes the violence all the more shocking.

The actress who plays Lisbet in this version is good, but for some (including myself) the original actress is going to forever be the one and only ""girl with the dragon tattoo.""  The American version of Lisbet was slightly more readable and sympathetic than in the original movie, which made her more easy to like, but things sometimes seemed a touch too wrapped-up in this one as opposed to the rough edges of both the character and first movie.  Part of the allure of Lisbet is her sharp, prickly, and essentially unlikeable exterior and in this characterization that outer shell was much more shallow.

I will buy this version, however, because it is well-done(if very hard to watch in places, be warned this is in no way, shape, or form a happy American story), but will definitely be keeping the original trilogy.  I would also go see the second movie if they go ahead and make it.

4225976,3,B003Y5H5HO,"For DVD/Blu-rays, I generally break down the review into the following categories.
** - I will not summarize the film or provide spoilers - **

1. General Quality of the Film
2. Video Quality
3. Audio Quality
4. Special Features
5. Verdict

1. General Quality of the Film
  You're reading this review because you are considering purchasing this product. This is my personal of the film; it is 100% subjective. In this case, the US version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was incredibly disappointing. Having read all of the Millennium books, and seen all of the extended Swedish films, I am somewhat biased because I have a baseline for comparison. Allow me to qualify further; I am a fan of David Fincher's work and I feel that he did a relatively decent job of preserving the main plot elements, but nevertheless I feel as though he failed to capture the captivating, immersive plot that has made this series an international sensation. The characters feel shallow and undeveloped, and the main characters failed to achieve the complex, visceral relationship that I feel is what makes this film and series great. Despite my criticisms, the film is worth watching *For Adults Only, as it contains graphic content including language, rape, and violence.

2. Video Quality
  I saw this on Blu-ray, so I cannot comment on the DVD version. It is this area where this version of the film shines, and perhaps eclipses the Swedish films. In addition to superior visual effects, the colors are rich are the definition is excellent. Fincher, filming in the same locations and conditions as the original Swedish miniseries, managed to capture the scenery in a way that almost make it a character in its own. The Blu-ray transfer is top quality, and the copy that I viewed did not have any motion blur or artifact.

3. Audio Quality
  Not typically a huge deal, but the 5.1 Digital Audio is superb. With a score composed by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, the audio comes through clear and the channels are well balanced so that dialogue is not drowned out by other elements of the film. I'm not going to go into great detail about the audio other than to say that it is excellent quality.

4. Special Features
  This is the section that typically makes or breaks a sale for me. I'm admittedly a huge film nerd and love watching featurettes and listening to director/actor/crew commentary. The commentary by David Fincher is great, because he explains some subtle elements of the film that may not be obvious on first view. He also goes into detail into the making of the film and divulges some plot elements from the book that were left out of the final cut due to time. The Blu-ray version also contains several featurettes that are quite interesting, as well as some standard 'making-of' and deleted scenes.

5. Verdict
 I know that I'm going to get a ton of flack for this, but I have to give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a strong RENT. Despite the fact that it does not live up to the book or Swedish film, it is still a visually striking thrilling mystery that will likely only disappoint hardcore cine-ophiles like me.",1335916800,3,3122,4.6923076923076925
4225996,3,B003Y5H5HO,"David Fincher version's of ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is, from a cinematographic point of view, better than its Scandinavian counterpart: more sophisticated, better edited, visually stunning. You get a taste of the ""Scandinavian noir"".  As thrillers go, there's a lot of action and information packed in those 2 hr 40 minutes to keep you on the edge of your seat; just blink and you are lost.

Fincher takes some liberty with the book, and why not? Stieg Larsson's novel is dense, and to translate it into movie choices had to be made.  Besides, directors are often tempted when lifting a story from a book to stamp their own seal of originality onto it.

So... Where is the grief? Well, taking ownership of a story is fine as long as it does not betray the author's original intent; especially if a director keeps the same title for their movie as the novel it comes from. That brings me back to the novel, which original title in Swedish is ""The Men Who Hate Women"". The main thread Larsson develops in his trilogy is the violence women are still subjected to in our male dominated societies. The reason his novels are so popular, despite their gruesome violence, is because of Lisbeth Salander, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Otherwise it would be your average Scandinavian noir, and there are a bunch of them out there.

Lisbeth is the heart of this story. As a victim who refuses to be victimized she answers violence with violence. She has her own code of ethics outside of society's conventions, and will take revenge whenever she feels it is justified. She does not show any vulnerability and does not seek to be liked.

Fincher's version betrays Larsson's novel in subtle and no so subtle ways. Starting with the poster (it's Daniel Craig's face up front) vs. the Swedish one (Rapace is the sole character on it). Mara's Lisbeth does have her quirkiness, and her IQ; but she is also shown more vulnerable, and her violence has been dialed down a (big) notch. Her interaction/relationship with Craig's Mikael is rebalanced so that he comes through as less ""passive"", not as out staged as he (willingly) is in the book. One telling example takes place towards the end of the movie. In this version, before going after the serial killer, Mara asks a half dead Craig what she should do with him once she catches him up. Lisbeth would never have asked because she knows what revenge she will exact against this women killer; she does not need anybody's permission, or worse, approval.

In the end this version has been designed to appeal to the American (male) audience. A woman can have an edge just enough to stray from the conventional brain dead bimbos Hollywood plagues us with, but certainly not as to challenge the established order (even in a movie) of our male dominated societies. Exactly what Larsson's was fighting against.",1335830400,4,2848,4.7414141414141415

Well, I absolutely loved this film.  It drew me in right away, and I was instantaneously in my own little world in rapt attention throughout this long movie.

I thought this Hollywood version was - for the most part - faithful to the book given the time constraints.  There were a few minor deviations, but nothing worth whining about.  One thing I definitely thought was outstanding about Hollywood's version was Daniel Craig's portrayal of Mikael Blomkvist; much more entertaining than his Swedish counterpart.",1335744000,,652,5.362745098039215

We know Craig is first rate - but so is Roony, whom I had never seen before.  Indeed, she is pitch perfect:  a damaged, enigmatic woman full of rage, with a particular talent, perhaps even genius, and a streak of cruelty.  I will have to buy this when the price is right, as I will want to watch it many more times.  I will get the other versions as well.

A disgraced journalist, Craig, is given a task by an ailing industrial magnate, who recognizes his family is full of crazies.  Craig becomes absorbed in the task, eventually taking on Roony as his assistant.  She soon proves invaluable, fighting her own battles all the while and emerging as a stunning and dangerous beauty.  Somehow, he touches her heart, unlocking secrets but also sensitivity and pain.  What they find was a complete surprise to me in all of its facets.  I don't want to reveal the plot, as it has many quirky twists that add subtle tastes to a somewhat traditional film noire plot line.

4226004,5,B003Y5H5HO,"'The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo', is one of the most talked about book seires these past few years and after reading the first instalment I understand why. It is a captivating white knuckle thriller that really breaks all the rules with bold and sometimes disturbing moments that just keep reading. So when they announced that an American version of the already made Sweedish film was on the way of course I was ready to go.

The director David Fincher already was one of my favorite directors and I love his work and of course this time he directed another winner. While there were some differences from the transition of book to film it was a movie that was just as gripping and bold as the pages. The cast was great and I knew that Rooney Mara would do a great job portraying Lisbeth, even getting an academy award nomination. Daniel Craig can do no wrong and even Robin Wright supprised me a little in the role she played as well.

I am a bit upset that this film didn't get the box office notice that it truly deserves, but at the same time a film that deals with some very debated topics is not one that the collective film going public would agree upon. I was happy that certain moments as graphic as the pages mentioned did show up on the film. I really hope that the universal concensious will not prevent the next two chapters from hitting the big screen and I hope that Fincher stays on to direct along with the cast and hopefully Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross for the soundtrack.",1335571200,2,1492,4.421818181818182
4226005,4,B003Y5H5HO,"Stieg Larsson is known in Sweden for his contribution to sci-fi fandom but to the outside world, he is known posthumously for his ""Millennium"" trilogy especially with the novel ""M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor (Men who hate women)"" aka ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", the first novel of the trilogy and a novel based on manuscripts by Larsson written  but unpublished until after his death in 2004.

In 2008, Larsson became the second best-selling author in the world and the trilogy had sold 27 million copies in more than 40 countries.

In 2009, the film received its Swedish adaptation and the film which was created for $13 million would go on to earn $102 million worldwide and with the success of the novels and the Swedish film, it was no surprise that Hollywood would come knocking and create an English version of the popular storyline.

The 2011 version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" was directed by award-winning director David Fincher (""Fight Club"", ""Se7en"", ""The Social Network"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") with a screenplay by veteran writer Steven Zaillian (""Schindler's List"", ""American Gangster"", ""Gangs of New York"").

The film would feature the cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth (""Fight Club"", ""The Social Network"", ""One Hour Photo"") and music by Trent Reznor (""The Social Network, ""Se7en"", ""Lost Highway"") and Atticus Ross (""The Social Network, ""Twilight"", ""Limitless"").

Starring in the film are Daniel Craig (""Casino Royale"", ""Quantum of Solace"", ""Cowboys & Aliens""), Rooney Mara (""The Social Network"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""Youth in Revolt""), Christopher Plumber (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""Beginners""), Stellan Skarsgard (""Good Will Hunting"", ""Thor"", ""Mamma Mia"") and Robin Wright (""Beowulf"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Moneyball"").

The film was quite successful in the box office earning over $229 million and also winning and being nominated for a plethora of awards worldwide.  Including an Academy Award for ""Best Film Editing"" (Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is presented in 2:40:1 anamorphic widescreen and presented in English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Dolby Surround plus an English audio descriptive track.  It's important to note that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" will be released on Blu-ray and this is one of those films that are shot in a variety of locations, beautiful cinematography that would look absolutely fantastic on Blu!

I didn't notice any compression artifacts or any major PQ problems.  Personally, I was impressed by the cinematography that I actually am looking forward in picking this film up on Blu-ray and watching it via HD.  It's a stunning film that the David Fincher and David Cronenweth really did a wonderful job in bringing Stieg Larsson's novel to life.

As for audio, once again, this is where audiophiles would opt for Blu-ray for its lossless soundtrack.  On DVD, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's music sounds clear and there are moments of action scenes such as a rifle shot and explosion, but it's a film where ambiance plays a big role in the film and what you hear the most through the surround channels.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" comes with the following special feature:

  Commentary by Director David Fincher - Featuring an in-depth audio commentary by director David Fincher.  From discussions of the cast, the characters, locations, stunts and overall making of the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

My first foray into ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" came from my wife.  Her family members have loved the novels and my wife was going crazy reading all three novels and then watching the film.  She has told me many times to read the novels in the trilogy but with so many books in my reading queue, I figured, why not see what the hype is all about and watch this film for myself.

When I watched the Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", I was drawn in by the performances of Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace.  Their performance was magnificent, as was the cinematography by Jens Fishcer and Eric Kress.  Just the amount of footage shot in various weather conditions and locations was quite impressive but most of all, bringing the novel to life (as my wife would say).

I also knew there would be a David Fincher version of the film but I was skeptical at first because I enjoyed the Swedish version so much.  When it was revealed that veteran Steven Zaillian would be writing the screenplay version and that Daniel Craig was hired to play Mikael Blomkvist, I figured, let's see how things go.

Similar to the Swedish version of the film, I absolutely enjoyed Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".

This film was not only suspenseful but it literally sent chills down my spine.  The film is not for the weak at heart when it comes to violence and torture.  The film has many graphic moments of people who have been murdered, people who have been raped and I'm not going to sugarcoat things... this film is violent.

But the film is also a suspenseful, haunting thriller that not only grabs your attention, you literally root for these characters that are completely opposite but they take you on an amazing ride with quite a bit of twists and turns along the way.  I have no problems saying that ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is one of the best modern suspense films that I have watched in long while.  And I'm talking about overall acting, cinematography, pacing and how well the story is conceived.  It's a fantastic film!

Personally, these characters are what I loved about the film.  The character of Mikael Blomkvist is an experienced writer who is taking on a billionaire and now having to face a serious libel charge that he libeled him due to false information he was given.  While I was skeptical of Daniel Craig at first, he managed to do a fantastic job playing the character. But the character I was the most skeptical is Lisbeth.  Noomi Rapace was fantastic and when I saw pictures of Rooney Mara prior to her playing Lisbeth, I was not sure how this would play out, but she instantly transformed herself into a new breed of Lisbeth.  Different from Rapace's version but still effective.  As for the character of Lisbeth Salander,  to see her as an anti-social, goth-like computer hacker brought another dimension to this film.

But what works is the slight changes that were made to this 2011 American version of the film from the original Swedish version of the film.  The American version actually incorporates more of the book to its storyline than the Swedish version.  For one, Blomkvist is not a character that has to be worried of going to prison.  This impacts Blomkvist in the Swedish version of the film, in the American version, he does not have to worry about prison time at all.

Another major difference is that the book focused more on the relationship between Mikael's Millennium Magazine partner Erika Berger and this is more evident in the American version.  Also, in the book, Mikael's daughter had importance and in the Swedish version, she was barely mentioned. In the U.S. version, Mikael's daughter is a major key to the discovery of deciphering the code made by Harriet.

There are also quite a bit of differences involving Lisbeth Salander, such as the Swedish version has her mugged by a gang of men, not the case of the US version.  Also, the introduction between Mikael and Lisbeth are very different between the two films.  But most importantly, the relationship of both Mikael having to work with Lisbeth and how it affects the characters to the final scene of the film.  Which I actually enjoyed from the American version over the Swedish version of the film.

While I enjoyed the Swedish version a lot, in many ways I also enjoyed the American version even more.  Mainly for its attention to details from the book that was incorporated into the film, although I enjoyed Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth Salander even more, Rooney Mara's version actually works much better.  But I do enjoy both films a lot, it's just that the 2011 version, they were able to incorporate more of the book and tweak the storyline a bit more.

I suppose it's a bit more subjective to the viewer familiar with the Swedish film and the book but if I wished there was two things that weren't changed in the American version, it would revolve around Blomkvist's problems with prison time and a scene revolving Lisbeth and the assailant, which I enjoyed from the Swedish version even more.

If there was one subject that I feel may touch a nerve with viewers is a rape scene (well, actually there are others who have been raped and tortured) but there is one graphic scene that may turn people off.  I for one, dislike disturbing scenes like this in a film especially if was done for shock value.  In the case of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", although a film that contains a lot of violence, I felt that the violence was not gratuitous and was appropriate to the story but again, this is subjective as I've read those who felt it was appropriate and others who felt it was bit too much for their taste.

As for the DVD, the DVD doesn't come with a lot of special features but an audio commentary by David Fincher.  As mentioned, if you want the best version of the films, go for the HD release as I'm sure the film will look and sound incredible on Blu-ray.  A movie this good, demands to be seen on Blu!

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a fantastic film featuring an awesome performance by the talent, a chilling screenplay adaptation and wonderful cinematography and music.  It's a film that will no doubt send shivers towards your spine but you will feel that you are captured by the film by the solid performances courtesy of Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.  These two were absolutely wonderful and felt that Steven Zaillian and David Fincher did a magnificent job in including more of the book to this adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".  And I can only hope the two work together again for the second film and see if they can fix some of the problems that the Swedish version of the film was criticized for.

Overall, I absolutely loved this film and if you have not watched this film yet, I absolutely recommend one putting this on their must-buy list for 2012.

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is highly recommended!",1335571200,,10466,4.800223214285714

4226008,4,B003Y5H5HO,"What's it about?

A journalist is helped by a highly intelligent female computer hacker (who will do ANYTHING for a dollar), to find a girl, missing for 40 years.

Is it any good?

I saw the original Swedish version when it was first released in 2007 and remember coming away feeling it was very good film. But, having seen the American adaption or remake (which ever it is), I came away feeling what a great film. Why? The success of the film is a result of David Fincher. His style, using his signature darkness, matches the tone and subject of the film to the ground. The music by Trevor Reznor is fantastic, mixed with some inspired choices, such as the pulsating opening sequence. James Bond himself, Daniel Craig, is very good in the lead role, but it's Rooney Mara, in her Oscar nominated performance, who is undoubtedly one of the highlights, in a film full of them.

Best bit?

Bond's capture and torture...set to the music of Enya, no less!

Did you know?

According to David Fincher the opening title sequence of the movie is a ""sort of primordial sort of tar and ooze of the subconscious... sort of her nightmare.""",1335484800,,1126,4.5721393034825875

Still, I appreciated Fincher making his point of view brilliantly clear, in chrome, and his use of sound particularly with the dinner scene in Martin Vanger's home.  Also loved Daniel Craig's humor. I rented to see the opening credits and the Hollywood gloss over of architectural eye candy. Also hoped the home viewing would help me appreciate Rooney Mara's portrayal enough to see the next Fincher installment for the price of a theater ticket. Much more satisfying with a remote control in hand.",1335484800,,905,5.073825503355705

4226012,5,B003Y5H5HO,"This is a fantastic film - the story very interesting with dramatic honesty about what abuse can do to a person in childhood.  Lisbeth's actions are very understandable in light of her childhood - every action has a cause.  The quality of acting is of course excellent, with the exception of Robin Wright whose makes only a lazy attempt at a European accent.  The ending is heart breaking - the backhand of the bourgeoise.  The American version is actually a little clipped when compared with the Swedish original, which unfolds with more detail and explanation.  The Swedish version is really terrific as well, with a different tone, and I have to say more loyalty between the two main characters.  Both are excellent films - definitely worth purchasing.",1335398400,,755,4.905511811023622
4226013,5,B003Y5H5HO,"If one would recall back to my review of the 2009 Swedish film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I expressed my worry of the upcoming American rendition of the film. My worry was for good reason. The Swedish film had a profound effect on me, and its star Noomi Rapace left an everlasting impression. How was I to handle the idea of a new cast and possible new take on the story?

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. What first stood out was that there were quite a few differences in this rendition. One of my worries was that it would be a shot-for-shot remake of the Swedish film, sort of like Let Me In (also based on a Swedish novel and film, Let the Right One In). This was not the case, and made me very excited once I started noticing this.

The second thing that took me by surprise was the Rooney Mara was quite impressive as Lisbeth Salander, the complex techie misfit. While Noomi Rapace and her portrayal of Lisbeth will always have a special place with me, Mara's take on the challenging role earned huge points in my book. Even the Swedish accent she had to take on for this film was consistent and sounded convincing.

When I saw the Swedish film, I was enthralled in the story and its heroine. I just had to have more of it, so part of me was looking forward to a new rendition just to be able to relive the story once again. The differences with the story gave me many reasons to enjoy this film and still feel the spirit and mystery with the tale.

In regards to the story itself, it follows Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a journalist set out to expose the corrupted, who is sentenced for libel. He's propositioned by an elder of a rich family to solve the mystery of a missing niece. Blomkvist gets deep into the family's dark secrets. Meanwhile Lisbeth Salander, a leather-clad computer geek turned  badass, is through unusual circumstances brought together with Blomkvist and the two form an unlikely team.

It's a story of men who hate women (which happens to be the Swedish title of the book and film), and two unique individuals with very different personalities who are also alike in so many ways. It is a dark and mysterious adventure that has the viewer feeling intrigued, excited, scared, and disgusted. On that note, one of my only complaints about the film was there may be a few exploitative and unnecessarily graphic scenes which do indeed get very emotional responses from the audience. While they may be accurate to the source material, seeing it is different than imagining it...but I'll refrain from ranting.

I thought by seeing the film once, it was over, but David Fincher's vision managed to give me a fresh new look at the same characters and story from a few different angles. The film is cool and stylish, and carries over the dark and bleakness of the snowy Swedish countryside that was so effective in the Swedish film. Now if they do what they did with this film on the two sequels, than I think we're in for yet another fun retelling of the story that has been taking over the world by storm.

Here is my beef:
The movie looks horrible. It was shot on a high tech digital camcorder, a Red 4k using Zeiss lenses. You would think this would mean something, and it does, a washed out lifeless, colorless, contrastless blah. This made the movie so hard to watch. This is such a well made film, whoops, I mean ""video"" that it is such a waste that it was shot on this immature medium. If this video had been shot on ""real film"" it would have been wonderful and rich with every scene complimenting in luxurious richness the power of the performances. But this was not to be.

I have seen the Red digi cams on other movies and the same problems abound. However I have seen movies and programs shot with the Arri digital cameras and they are astoundingly rich and lovely. So what is wrong with the Reds and why do they suck? It is just such a shame that directors are jumping on the digital bandwagon before the medium has solved all its dynamic range issues.

Lisbeth had a RUTHLESS ""GUARDIAN"" and this One was not as Brutal making You Feel even more for Her and Less for Him even Hating Him in the Swedish Version. In this Film He was much more ""Humanized"" and Far less of a Sociopath as in Swedish Film.

4226052,3,B003Y5H5HO,"I'm new to the Millennium trilogy, both the books and Swedish film adaptations. So many people raved about the first book, in particular, that I was very much looking forward to watching the video.

As the header to this review says I believe those expectations let me down.

But let's look at the positives. Rooney Mara is outstanding in her role as Lisbeth. Daniel Craig once again shows that he is far more than just James Bond and does a good job. The cinematography was excellent. It was great seeing the move set in Sweden and it was very well shot.

The beginning titles are superb but also reveal the strong evil undercurrent that pervades the movie. And it's that evil that I struggled with the most. The rape scenes are terrible and I wasn't at all prepared for those. It took me back to days of watching horror movies hiding behind the couch.

The first third of the movie is quite slow and doesn't really get moving nor all that interesting until the two main characters get working together. At that point it moves along at good pace. It's a dialogue-rich movie that requires attention to track the investigation for a serial killer.

It's not something I'd watch again and I'm not sure I will watch the second instalment except that I'm curious to know how it joins up with the first as there appeared to be closure at the end.",1335139200,,1341,4.524793388429752

Amazed at all the hoops you have to fly through in order to have the digital copy on your computer.  Still wondering if it will still be there in a year or so.  First you have to register and come up with an ID and passwords on 2 sites, or was it 3?  I lost track late in the day.  And one site kept logging me off, and after I input the small code after help from my magnifying glass, the code did not work, but then all of the sudden the video was on my site anyway, maybe it was the praying?  But still, I could not get the digital copy where I wanted it most, to my iTunes digital file.  I did figure out how to download the download manager and I think it did actually download to my computer instead of just the Sony cloud, but I will not bet my life on it.  And had the same problem with Universal too.  No, I do not care for the promo emails so why bother?  I am not a 12 year old kid that wants the magic rings or emails telling me the videos to get since I often sit through the 20 minutes of movie reviews when I do rarely see a video at the theater.  I just miss the days not long ago when you could just stick the dvd in your dvd drive and voila' the digital file downloads to your iTunes file with no hassle or work to do.

4226112,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I've read the Millennium Trilogy and have seen the extended versions of the Swedish films with Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace. First of all, I highly recommend that you read the books before watching any of the film versions (btw, watch all the Swedish films in original subtitles not dubbed).  That said, I want to highly recommend David Fincher's new film version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" which I have seen four times.  I know people love to compare which film version of the book is better and which actor does the better job in his or her role.  I have to say that Noomi Rapace and Mara Rooney both do admirable jobs with the fantastic Lisbeth Salander character.  Likewise, so does Nyqvist and Craig with the Blomkvist character.  Rapace's Salander does seem to be a more mature interpretation. Her Salander is tougher, and more directly in control; whereas Rooney's toughness surprises because she's obviously much younger (and closer to Salander's age in the book) and therefore seems a touch more vulnerable because of it.  Both film versions interpret the book well, but there are some differences.  It's important to note that Fincher's film is an interpretation of the book, and not the Swedish film. If I had to pick which film followed the book's details more closely, I would have to pick Fincher's, even though what happens to a key character at the end of the mystery was changed. But not significantly enough to effect the final outcome.  He does manage to keep the last poignant scene of the book intact, though, which I liked very much.  Basically, Fincher's version is more cinematic, better filmed, edited and scored. It is appropriately dark and chillingly cold, like the subject matter.  The Swedish film has more daylight and sunshine in it, it seems.  However, again, both films are great, both beautifully acted, and I highly recommended you watch both of them.  I just hope Fincher gets to the do the other two books and complete his film version of the trilogy.",1334707200,,2004,4.8274853801169595

4226149,5,B003Y5H5HO,"The Swedish film was good and nothing has been changed in the drama nor the thriller. It is made more explicit on things Scandinavians practice a lot but do not show, sex and emotions. So the sex scenes are more developed though they remain within Parental Guidance and the emotions are of course essentially present at the end and of course again in the negative way, the disappointment is for Lizbeth, the poor girl who thought she could be loved by a real respectable man on a permanent basis.

The film does not bring one iota more on the exploitation of the young people who are made dependent on the state and under guidance, control and even at times more from some kind of bureaucrat who takes advantage of the situation for his own perversions. Be sure if it were a woman the situation would be the same. The bureaucrat always thinks his authority gives him the privilege of exploiting those who are under his or her control.

In the same way a family business has become an impossible quagmire because the members of such a family consider that their name gives them the privilege of exploiting the business to their own benefit, to exploit the workers with the same objective, and of course to cover up their worst impulses under the virginity of the power of money. It is true at the same time the Swedish family business that is used as a screen to hide criminal activities is redoubled with the case of another international business, this time not family at all, that is a blanket covering the recycling and laundering of all kinds of drug and criminal money. This extension is quite funny in a way since it will serve the vengeance of the raped and humiliated and exploited dependent girl who gets rich by just hacking a whole set of accounts in the Caiman Islands. No complaint possible since it is criminal money in a tax and financial haven.

What's left is the denunciation of the deep hypocrisy of the Swedish society about its past. Sweden was one of the first countries in the western world to introduce eugenic laws against all kinds of people who were a burden to society, more than thirty of forty years before Hitler in Germany and quite in line with what the British author H.G. Wells advocated at the end of the 19th century that will also produce social Darwinism and behaviorism in the USA.

Then in the past and still in the present the people who are classified in those categories, Swedish or foreign, are silent preys to the predators who are in the positions where they cannot be asked any question. The police will do its job but without the means they need, nor the will they need, to get to the rock bottom of the problem and the criminals will walk free and proud, respected and even loved in society.

That film should make us think and think again and we should keep in mind that politicians are too often doing the same and a prostitution ring can operate in one of the most important hotels of a big city, across from its opera and nothing is done till finally some scandal comes up generally from outside the country or from a marginal complaint and political interests are finally giving the police the power they need to do their job. Everyone knows about it, and first of all the mayor or mayoress of the city but everyone pretends nothing is happening, including the press that is so blind at times.

If you don't believe it is possible just go to Lille in France, New York in the USA and presently a city in Shanghai had the same problem with the mayor being demoted;, including from all his national and regional jobs and his wife is in custody under the charge of having killed a British journalist who was too nosy.

What is the world coming to? Go see that film and you'll understand just 10% of what it really is.

I also love crime/serial killer thrillers; Silence of the Lambs and Zodiac are favorites. I have to say he did a fabulous job on his adaptation. The film is distinctly Fincher; dark, ominous, moody, detailed, and long-time collaborator Jeff Cronenweth's cinematography is incredible as usual. Rooney Mara really made this film for me. She was amazing and looked badass. Two things that I didn't care for: the British actors's lack of Swedish accents (took away from the continuity), and the overdrawn bank heist ending.

The blu-ray set itself is amazing; the packaging design is cool, there are a massive amount of extra features, and the blu-ray looks amazing in 1080p. I, unlike the ridiculously obnoxious 1-star UV hating Apple fanboy reviewers here, have to give this 5 stars: it's a good film and the blu-ray set itself was a great deal when I bought it on sale. The UV works nicely and not anywhere near the hassle it's made out to be, but UV is a massively insignificant extra feature for me to begin with (and that IS what it IS, an extra.

4226156,5,B003Y5H5HO,"A tormented woman's passion and courage - to reclaim her freedom & stature and bring to justice a misogynistic serial killer while befriending, aiding, rescuing, and making love to an investigative reporter in his own exhaustive hunt for the deadly truth - reigns supreme in the English language film version ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo."" Directed by David Fincher; Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig) and Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara); screenplay adaptation by Steven Zaillian; film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall (won Academy Award); original three novels written by the late Swedish mystery novelist Stieg Larsson and superbly edited by Eva Gabrielsson. We are easily swept up in the complex, hyper-intriguing hunt by our heroine Lisbeth for a serial killer presented in a stunning sequential order of unfolding events and plot twists - that hold one almost in amazement at times.

So much has been written about these tightly-woven films and their positive impact upon women and girls around the world, their influence on the romance-thriller genre in novel writing & screenwriting, their ferocity to tell a high-end story about a pair of fiercely intelligent serial killers and still keep it reigned into a powerful but digestible film storyline, and their tenacity to reel in the sub-plots and multiple plot endings into a precise denouement along a superior crescendo or ascending mode of action with an original wildly-filmed plot. Depth of character, sustained plot tension, and powerful, realistic acting performances dominate each film in such a way - that we want to see them again.

Once in awhile we see these brilliant, pro-women, pro-active film trilogies take off and make their way into multiple languages - as if all along they were meant to be translated at breadneck speed throughout the world - so one and all - women and men - can drive a long distance to catch one or two of these films in sequence at a single movie theatre. And we are talking about movie goers going out in perhaps severe weather condition to see any one of these cinematic masterpieces. Realism, honesty, thorough journalistic practices, true mystery & suspense scriptwriting & storyboarding, sado-masochistic & erotic side-plots that tightly weave like electrifying eels returning to their comfort lair - back into the original storyline - all create an experiential type of cinema - that becomes exhilarating, challenging to the senses, sensual, and intensely played out for our enjoyment and enrichment.",1333670400,,2527,5.1911764705882355
4226157,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I have seen both the Swedish and American versions of the book and I have to say the American version is the best, but both versions are good.

First off, Rooney Mara's performance is nuanced and the American version seems to give her story more weight. The Swedish version concentrates a little more heavily on other characters. She is after all supposed to be the center of attention. I don't think the Swedish version even quite gave her equal time. Anyway, Naomi does a good job, but she doesn't give you the sense that the character has any mental problems. Rooney totally captures the characters, cold, almost autistic state. You know there is something wrong with her. She deserved the oscar nomination. Infact, all the acting is stellar.

Secondly, the way the director devides the story is unique. It's interesting the way the characters come together and it keeps you interested.

Lastly, the cinematography of the American version is excellent. Sweden is a beautiful but cold country. It looks pretty on film but I'm glad I don't live there.

I would have loved to see more time spent on Lisbeth's first guardian, Holger Palmgren and more about Lisbeth's past. Much of the plot unfolds via the actions of the characters and there is little narration during a few crucial chapters so if you haven't read the books then you may miss a thing or two if you're not paying close attention.

Supporting cast is excellent.
But the film itself is a work of art. It is gorgeous to watch, the detail, the movement, the flow from scene to scene. This is a film that should be shown in film school on how to direct a film. And how to act in a film.
Yeah, there are a few scenes hard to watch. I don't know about anyone else SPOILERS but I find the scene were Lisbeth is tied up and raped to be one of the most disturbing I have ever seen. But it is important in understanding the character and the world in which she lives. The book, of course, is able to explore this much more thoroughly but I do admire how much they put into this film.

I'd also watched all three Swedish movies on my Kindle Fire before I'd even heard of the American remake.  After reading the other reviews, I rented the American version to get another take on Elizabeth.  I was disappointed.  To be honest, I can't quite put my finger on the reasons for it, but to me Elizabeth lost her sharp edginess in this version.  One thing was that in her first appearance in this film, she wore the ""in-your-face"" Goth outfit  that didn't show up until the culminating court scene in the Swedish film.  It seemed that her radical appearance was the high point, and her ability to fascinate ebbed  downward from there.  End result?

I couldn't guess who the ""bad guy"" was until I was shown and I thought it had some clever writing that brought the 2 stories together. The beginning credits are kinda bizarre but hey, you might like it. One last thing, I feel that alot of the reviews on Amazon.com are over-analizing the movies or albums they're reviewing. Personally I don't care if the movie ""strayed from the book writer's original intent"" or your $10,000 Bang & Olufsen stereo showed a ""flat spot at 7,500 mhz"" during a guitar solo, I just want to know if the movie's worth watching or the album's worth listening to...",1333324800,,875,4.440993788819876

Within the movie itself viewers of the original are most apt to be put off by other differences such as the  exaggerated tats, piercings and makeup as well as the exaggerated robotic emotional portrayals. The difference is analogous to seeing entertainment oriented fake wrestling vs. the real wrestling. The editing was disjointed as our characters seemed to jump from scene to scene despite the distances. The acting was a little too stiff. Lisbeth's and Mikael's computer skills seemed like what an older, computer illiterate person might engage in while doing a goog search. The sex scenes seemed to be added solely to gain market share and just didn't add to the story. Lisbeth's and Mikael's problem solving research were a far-fetched not believable. Their physical actions seemed dumb e.g. Lisbeth sneaking up on someone in loud clunking shoes on marble floors was just a ""sure you are"" or Mikael sneaking around and out of the house only to get caught. A ""dummy"" of a supposedly smart investigator. You didn't feel as if she was the one riding the motorcycle. Just a roller coaster, uneven ride of a movie.",1333324800,8,1314,5.027522935779817

First, the good.  The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Rooney Mara is amazing as Lisbeth Salander, as is Daniel Craig playing Mikael Blomkvist.  All the actors do justice to their characters.  The scenery was also very close to what I'd pictured when reading the book.

Unfortunately, the story itself was poorly paced.  It moved too fast in some parts, and too slow in others.  There were points in the movie where I found myself thinking, ""that's not now I remember that happening"" and times when I'd feel like things were either out of order or a little confusing.

I can't decide whether it's better to read the book before seeing this movie, or watch the movie first and then read the book.  It's a good movie, but for fans of the book and the Swedish movie it'll throw you off a bit.",1333324800,,928,4.431952662721893

  I just wanted to remove the disc from DVD player and watch the Swedish version again....
  I thought Rooney Mara was horrible as Salander(And everyone has their own opinion). The locations were nice in this film. As they were in the Swedish version also.

And the film has its share of mood, intrigue/suspense and of course sex & violence.  It's a very explosive movie (figuratively and literally).  The only problem I have is its almost like 3 different movies.  The ""girl"" (with the dragon tattoo) is cooperating with a journalist to solve a 40 year old mystery surrounding a missing person at the behest of a kind wealthy man.  This comes after said journalist comes under fire for niavely(sp???) reporting a story that has little to no truth based on a rumor he overheard.  This sounds like a fairly decent story and it is, like I said it's very entertaining.  But then the mystery is solved and we go back to the journalist's woes & how he attempts to get even with some guy who set him up to report a story that he should have known better to report...that goes on for about half an hour and it's not clear why the script focused on that so heavily.  As for the 3rd ""story"", I guess it was a form of character development but, to put it vaguely as to not spoil anything, it deals with gov't corruption and how the GWDT, who is the victim of this corruption, gets rid of the problem.  Perhaps you could classify this as ""pulp"", but it's very well done.",1333324800,,1350,4.473469387755102

Really?  And a 23-year-old Goth druggie who has somehow learned a stunning array of investigative and banking skills that even the most seasoned cop wouldn't command?  Uh...no.  Basically, the story arc is ridiculous.

But Daniel Craig does a fine job and Rooney Mara is riveting.  She takes one of the most unbelievable characters ever written and makes it her own.  And, by the way, hats off to Robin Wright, who has aged beautifully and doesn't, unlike Julia Roberts, desperately try to disguise it.

I could have totally done without the anal rape scene, however.  Was there a point to that?",1333324800,,765,4.90625
4226221,3,B003Y5H5HO,"I purchased the BlueRay version.

First comment:  on my high end sound system - the audio wasn't simply bad, it was so garbled that we had to turn on English subtitles.

Second comment:  The director did not get the point of the books.  Missed it entirely.

On watching the special features, one sees why.  The director declared that ""all people are perverts"".  This leaves the director in with perverts, who are always convinced that everyone is just as perverted as they are, just afraid to act out.

And, strangely, that was a comment the villain in the book makes (and in the Swedish version), but has been edited out of this version of the movie.

In fact, most of the solution of the mystery, and clues leading to it, are glossed over so quickly in a rapid-fire single-conversation-piece as to leave the viewer out of the loop in the way the mystery was solved.  What isn't given short treatment are the rape and torture scenes, and revenge sequence.

Lisbeth is also transformed from the almost autistic (to an outsider) behavior that is a critical component of Lisbeth's character into a traumatized punker.  And a end-of-the-fireball conversation between Lisbeth and Bloomquist was a most serious omission.

In fact - it is very clear that, unlike the Swedish director - this director did not understand the books or the character.

GWDT is about abusers, abuse, and how authorities, bystanders, and family all react to abuse.  There are significant insights in the book.  This movie doesn't even approach them.

And the start of the movie shows why.  For the director, this was just an action movie that had sufficient material in the original to justify scenes of sadism.  The Bond like introduction and overall treatment miss any deep thought or serious consideration.  It is simply a search for excuses to be graphic.

Overall, the movie is watchable.  Rooney Mara did a fine job.  But her Lisbeth is not the one of the book.  Craig's Bloomquist is one dimensional.  For fans who want the character and themes of the book, watch the Swedish version.  It is well done, and it is better to read the subtitles than to attempt to make out the audio on this botched Blueray Disk.",1333238400,2,2187,4.762666666666667

4226225,4,B003Y5H5HO,"This movie keeps you engaged while purposefully unfolding the mysteries.  Slowly folding back piece by piece who is doing what, who knows what, and then allowing you to build conclusions you will later deem correct or off the mark.

As the movie starts there are 2 different story lines and it swaps between them, you follow Mikael for a bit to learn about his life, and see where he is going.  Then the scenes change back to Lisbeth and you learn about her and her life.  Both of the main lines carry on for a bit with only glimpses as to how they might merge.  As the stories come together, the magic of the movie comes to life, you really see the energy, the passion and the on screen chemistry unfold.

Be warned this is a dark movie, rape scenes, murder and other dark topics are covered.  As to be expected the movie is filmed in an overcase grey way to add to the feeling of darkness.  Cold and dark, mysterious, fast paced scene changes as events build and the tone accelerates through the movie.

The movie is unable to fill in many of the details the book includes.  It takes paying attention and often the words are covered with music or other audio making it hard to understand.  I needed to use my 10 second replay feature many times to make sure I understood exactly what was just said.  The understanding of some characters and their role in Lisbeth's life leads to some wondering as she becomes known to the audience, these are topics filled in with greater detail in the book, with the movie you must infer things.

The Film-

David Fincher has directed several of my favorite films of the last twenty years but he's had almost as many misses as he has hits. The Game, Panic Room, and The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button are technically impressive films that I wouldn't qualify as bad but I rarely feel the need to revisit. On the other hand Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac are films that I can watch repeatedly and take away something new on every viewing. Somehow I still haven't seen The Social Network so I can't speak to its successes or failures but I can unequivocally say that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo will be another Fincher film that I will visit often for years to come.

Investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) has just lost a libel case for an ""unflattering"" article he wrote which has put him in and his publisher in financial ruin. Mikael is summoned to a meeting with Henrik Vanger, a wealthy businessman. Henrik presents him with the opportunity to investigate the suspected murder of his niece Harriet almost forty years ago. It soon becomes clear that he is in over his head and needs a second pair of eyes to piece together the mystery. Mikael's employer puts him in contact with Lisbeth, a skilled investigator with a personality as unique as her dragon tattoo.

To describe this film as dark doesn't do it justice. The world that Mikael and Lisbeth inhabit is bleak, filled with unsavory characters in both the past and present. Mikael's investigation at first glance may look like the film's main focus but it's actually Lisbeth's story that drives The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Her story is weaved throughout Mikael's investigation and while that storyline is more of a procedural her story carries the emotional arc of the story. The film turns convention on its ear by making the strongest character the woman even though because of her circumstances is repeatedly victimized.

There are disturbing scenes that will make you squirm and feel uncomfortable; the flip side of that coin is that it's riveting and those scenes payoff in spades later. Fincher never glorifies the violence, but he doesn't shy away from it either. He lets it play out naturally and doesn't edit away the horror; he forces you to look away by just letting the camera roll.

While I haven't read the Stieg Larsson novels or seen the original Swedish film to compare to this film I was completely engulfed by Steve Zaillian's script. I purposely avoided the novel and films leading up to the release of the US version so I wouldn't be comparing and contrasting it against its other incarnations. Zaillain's script doesn't fall prey to the pitfalls that usually doom American adaptations such as ham-handedly explaining to the audience what the morale of the story is or tacking on a ""Hollywood"" ending to an otherwise good film.

David Fincher's team has created an enveloping world that made Sweden feel like its own character. Every shot looks stunning and continues to show why Fincher has one of the best set of eyes in the industry. Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross' moody score blur the line between a conventional film score and something more in tune with rock music. The score is like plugging a pair of headphones into Lisbeth's brain and listening to her internal struggle put to music.

All the performances are simply fantastic which isn't unexpected considering what he's been able to do with Brad Pitt (""What's in the box!?"") Even though Daniel Craig gets top billing Rooney Mara is the star and she's simply fantastic. As I mentioned earlier, some horrible things happen to Lisbeth's character and she completely sold me on her portrayal by going all out in her performance. As usual Daniel Craig was very good as well; his character isn't given as much to go through but his performance is still very good. The always great Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgrd also bring ""A"" game performances and an elder statesmen touch to the film. Christopher Plummer finally won an Academy Award this year for his role in Beginners but he could have easily won it for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo as well.

This is about as close to a perfect film as you're going to find in this day and age. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo isn't for the faint of heart. You may see things that you may not want to see but this qualifies as a film where the juice is definitely worth the squeeze.

The Disc-

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is housed inside a cardboard case inside of a cardboard sleeve. I found it difficult to pull the case from the sleeve which has caused the corners of the inside case to look dented and worn. Inside the cardboard case you'll find three discs; one Blu-ray featuring the film, a second Blu-ray with all the special features, and a third disc that is simply a DVD/UltraViolet Digital Copy. If you're a fan of disc art you'll love the artwork or lack thereof on the DVD copy; it simply looks like a standard Sony brand DVD-R with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo sloppily written across the front which feels quite appropriate for the film

In terms of video and audio quality Sony has turned in almost a perfect disc. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was shot digitally using a combination of the Red Epic and Red One cameras. The film presentation is flawless; there's not a trace of banding or edge enhancement and black levels are perfectly inky. None of this is a surprise since all of David Fincher films with the exception of The Game and Panic Room have received amazing transfers on Blu-ray.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA lossless soundtrack offers up an extremely engaging experience from the moment the film begins with the James Bond-esque opening sequence. While the film isn't overly action oriented that doesn't mean that the surrounds channels don't create an enveloping experience. Directionality isn't gimmicky but everything from the busy subways to the wind whipping through the frozen woods comes alive. Dialogue is well balanced and is always intelligible which is important because if you were to miss something you could find yourself rewinding. If the soundtrack falters in any way it's in terms of bass which I found to be overpowering. At one point I had to turn down the volume of my entire system because I was concerned about blowing my subwoofers.

Disc One's only special feature is the audio commentary by David Fincher. He is one of the few directors I'll listen to just for ""fun.""

Disc Two houses all the other special features which are all presented in HD and unless otherwise noted contain a mix of behind the scenes footage and interviews with the cast and crew.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was one of the best film's of 2011 and is an early front runner for one of the best Blu-ray's of 2012. This is a film that will take you down a very dark road but its still a trip worth making and is one of David Fincher's best films thus far. Rooney Mara's performance is quite frankly amazing but she is just one of many great performances in the picture. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a must see film on a near perfect Blu-ray.",1333065600,2,8255,4.795918367346939

The film was very slow, fragmented and could barely hear the lines. In summary: boring. I rather watch reruns of Andy Griffith Show.",1332979200,,295,4.9
4226261,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Kept me on edge the whole time, actors were true to character, especially Lisbeth. Some sex scenes were too violent for me to watch. I wish I had not read the book first.",1332979200,2,170,4.181818181818182
4226262,2,B003Y5H5HO,"What so say?  These beloved books were carefully crafted into a beautiful Swedish movie and the American remake falls short in so many areas--characterization, story, societal commentary, acting...so much has been changed or is incompetent, it really is, at best, a 1.5 star film.  The Swedish is a 4 or 5 star film.  [We Americans, in general, are just too stupid or arrogant to watch a movie in another language.]  Here is how Fincher and the producers got it wrong.

First, and foremost, this version makes Lisbeth subjugated to Mikael.  In the books and the Swedish film, Lisbeth is on crusade against misogynistic men and does whatever it takes to get the bad guys.  She always is proactive or reacts immediately to the situation she finds herself in.  She is the reason the killer is identified.  She finds the first clue to the murder, she chases the bad guys, she is on top in the love scenes.  In the American version, of course, Daniel Craig has to find the first clue [although Lisbeth finds the rest], he is on top, and she asks permission, the stupidest thing of all, to go after the killer.  This character would never do this; she would just act.  And just so you know, I am a man and this change in the nuances of the story shows the ""war on women"" that is taking place in this country.

Second, the buzz around the film was its rawness and explicitness.  Nonsense, many of the hard edges have been smoothed away for our sensitive American audiences.  Lisbeth is raw because Swedish society has treated women badly, especially her.  The Swedish film made major statements about how the establishment deals with women and while some of that is still in this version, I am sure the producers had to tone it down so as to not offend their Swedish hosts.

Third, the acting is awful.  Daniel Craig has shown himself to be the stick he really is.  He shows nothing in this, no emotion, no caring, nothing beyond his chiseled features.  He is not human as is Michael Nyqvist in the original.  Nyqvist shows a nice arc through the film, coming to grips with his own concerns about Lisbeth and finally warming to her.  Noomi Rapace [the Swedish female lead] is brilliant in the lead.  Dangerous but appropriately motivated.  Ultra competent in many areas.  Exceptionally intelligent and strong willled.  Strong but, occasionally soft.  Rooney Mara, like Daniel Craig, is wooden and shows no dimension.  [Here is another case where the female character's competency had to be changed in favor of male domination.  In the American version, the final solution is handed to Mikael by the Swedish patriarch.  In the book and the Swedish movie, Lisbeth does it all on her own and gives it to Mikael.  Amazing how these subtle changes are so patterned throughout this production.] Even venerable Christopher Plummer pales in comparison to his Swedish counterpart in creating a multi-layered, believable character.

For the life of me, I cannot understand all the buzz around this weak remake.  Do yourself a favor, buy or rent the original, yes, read the subtitles, and be ready for a roller coaster ride of the first order.",1332979200,4,3125,4.759776536312849
4226263,4,B003Y5H5HO,"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is an example of Hollywood's finest delving you headlong into a vat of icy cold stew and promptly pummeling you in ways you would rather not imagine. The plot is pure Agatha Christie with a little techno S&M tinge that colors most of the environments a seedy saturated tone (browns, blacks, everything industrial gloom) with smatters of red here and there, pooling around, say, a graphically eviscerated animal. The film is high-powered grotesque, with a rape scene so savage one wonders how the MPAA didn't fall from their chairs to burn the film strip as it unspooled before them. Perhaps the film was saved due to the immaculate care injected into every frame. David Fincher is no stranger to such off-putting territory, cajoling audiences to enter sweat-smeared, homoerotic basements in the cult classic Fight Club or serial killer labyrinths in Seven. Fincher's production values are unsettlingly adept, despite a credit sequence that would look more at home in Ryan Murphy's far-less-unnerving show American Horror Story. At the foreboding estate (or estates--they are all around, encroaching sinisterly!) where Daniel Craig's blacklisted Blumquist is received to solve an ancient murder, there is no end to the terror of the landscape. The ground itself seems to ooze suspense. Unlike Fincher's plodding police procedural Zodiac--which lulled between the murder sequences--G.W.T.D.T. is captivating and eerie from start to finish.
 Elsewhere, Rooney Mara kills it--a knockout as the beautiful ghoul, the electric woman scorned...and scorned...and scorned. As the titular character, she owns the screen, demanding our attention as she hacks computers or continues sex until she is completely satisfied even if her partner has other things on their mind. Her performance is extra shocking given the fact that she was also so believable as the disgruntled co-ed dumped by Mark Zuckerberg in Fincher's Social Network. Revelatory acting work! In fact, Daniel Craig is the only player here who seems slightly out-of-place. There is even word that he regarded one of the aforementioned rape scenes with a hand over his mouth, reporting, ""Dear God"" to Fincher. He reacts to the increasing dread with similar unease--this is no Bond--but a man shattered by what he uncovers in the forgotten killing grounds where ex-Nazis likely dwell. You may hesitate on joining him for this vicious, technically-superb venture, especially if this is territory you've already braved with subtitles.",1332979200,3,2513,5.378172588832487
4226264,5,B003Y5H5HO,I have seen many many movies in 2011 and By far the best movie I have seen. The acting is phenomenal the whole movie is suspenseful.

4226265,2,B003Y5H5HO,"I don't know if watching the Swedish version first ruined this movie for me, but something did.  The female lead, Rooney Mara, didn't stand a chance in reinterpreting Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth Salander. Daniel Craig was adequate but Michael Nyqvist owned the male lead character as well.  The Swedish version is rawer, grittier, and the tense mood is retained throughout the movie.  I don't know if it was just my connection but I also had trouble hearing some of the mumbled dialog in the American version.  Maybe it was just me.  I felt like I needed subtitles for this version too.  If you get the chance, check out some of the Swedish films.  Sometimes I think Hollywood has a lot to learn.  I see lots of foreign films for $7.95/mo on N$tflix.",1332892800,6,790,4.673913043478261

What I don't get in the American version is the twist with Harriet Vanger. It was sort of missing here. I was confused. I was expecting a trip to Australia not a return trip to London. What happened to Anita Vanger who helped Harriet escape to Australia???

Also I think Lisbeth got her revenge better in the Swedish version. I had to squint to read what was written on the guy in the American version.

My vote goes for the Swedish version as being better overall.",1332892800,3,705,4.4921875

4226281,2,B003Y5H5HO,"Like most people, I already knew about the story before having watched this version of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I had watched the Swedish version and was looking forward to the American one to compare, especially after having heard all of the rave reviews for it.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.

There are two reasons why I am disappointed:  Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.  Daniel Craig's version has none of the conscience or heart of Nyqvist's version, which I had thought made him a perfect character in a story where those feelings are few and far between.  I liked the idea that Blomkvist had a sense of empathy, which made him a great foil to Salander who is all calculating vengeance.

Next to deadpan Craig is deadpan Mara, who seems to have a ""been-there-done-that"" attitude to everything that happens to or around her.  She's almost boring to look at, no matter how shocking the scene is.  There's no inner fragility and no sense that she is having to endure a lot like Rapace's version does.  I found myself losing interest by the end of the American version, mostly because there seemed little interest in Craig's and Mara's expressions.  If they didn't care what they were doing, why should I?

But kudos to the supporting actors and actresses, especially Joely Richardson and Christopher Plummer.  And the dreary, cold setting for the movie was well done; it lent a foreboding atmosphere to the tragic story.

Sorry to all the fans of the movie, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy this version of the Dragon Tattoo.",1332806400,6,1546,4.741573033707865

The actual film surprised me initially.  Daniel Craig was of course excellent.  Rooney Mara vastly exceeded my expectations but did not captivate me as did Noomi Rapace.

Although the cinematography & the set details were excellent overall, the lighting, the flatness of it, disturbed me as it did not contribute appropriately.

Not the failure I expected but not an overall excellent film.  Although this was a good film, the original still excels.",1332720000,,690,4.829059829059829

The acting is also amazing too with Rooney Mara receiving a well deserved Oscar nomination for her work as Lisbeth Salander. She really created more of a three dimensional character than how she was portrayed in the Swedish films, which came across to me as little more than a one dimensional punk chick with the same angry expression and the same haircut. It didn't feel as real to me as this portrayal of Lisbeth Salander did.",1332720000,2,506,4.696629213483146

""Were they trying to prove that Hollywood could do it better than Swedish Cinema?"".  ""Did they want to reach the audience that simply refuses to read subtitles?"".

If they wanted to make an Americanized version, they should have at least changed the story and characters to take place in the US of A.  The Swedish ""accents"" were annoying and everything felt out of place.

Yes, I know I feel this way because I watched the original trilogy first, and I would probably feel the same if I watched an Italian version of ""Gone with the Wind"", it just would not feel right.  (With all due respect to Italian Cinema, one of my favorites).

4226312,3,B003Y5H5HO,"So we all know that this was originally a Sweedish movie with English subtitles, right? And we all know that Director David Fincher simply re-did this American version of the film albeit with a completely different cast, right? And we all know that the movie(s) is based on the first of three books in a trilogy by Sweedish Author Stieg Larsson (RiP), right? And we all know that the original title of the book and movie were changed from Men Who Hate Women to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo so that it would be well received marketingwise in the US and not perceived as a bash against men by antisexism groups, right? And finally, we all know that two more films in the trilogy have already been released with the Sweedish cast (with less than positive reviews) and that Sony says the American cast has signed on for re-dos of the two sequels here in the US...right?

Whew. With all that out of the way, I thought The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was very good. Two story lines woven together nicely. The first story line follows Journalist Mikael Blomkvist after being convicted of libel for accusing a high powered businessman of unethical and illegal activity. The widely publicized trial brings Blomkvist to the attention of another high powered businessman named Vanger who is looking for a long lost niece; Vanger thinks Blomkvist would be the perfect person to solve the mystery of his 40 years missing niece.

Enter storyline 2: Vanger has hired a Goth lady named Lisbeth to determine if Blomkvist is the right man to hunt for his niece. And the story arcs from there to the struggles of Lisbeth's everyday life of trying to make ends meet while on probation for some crimes committed in her relatively distant past. Be warned, like the Swedish version, there are some scenes of rape and torture that are very unsettling and difficult to sit through in this film.

Ultimately, both story lines are brilliantly connected with each other in a thriller tale of intrigue, deception, mystery, murder and revenge. It's a very good movie that stands on its own with no cliffhanger ending that requires seeing the upcoming sequels. Highly recommended but not for the squeamish.

Having seen the original film I found myself involuntarily comparing Fincher's US version to the Sweedish version a few times during the film. And there was something about the original Sweedish version that made everything so much more real...especially Lisbeth, the character played by Rooney Mara. Fincher made Lisbeth somewhat of a, how should I say this?...""anti-superhero???"" While Noomi Rapace played Lisbeth in the Sweedish version with a seriousness that made you think she was a real person out there somewhere, and that a camera followed her like a fly on the wall. Mara was good, but Rapace was great.",1332720000,,2793,4.836820083682008
4226313,4,B003Y5H5HO,"I haven't seen the original Swedish film on which this English version is based, so my review is based purely on David Fincher's movie.
The movie is beautifully photographed, its snowy setting underscoring the chilling storyline.  Its intricate plot demands close attention, as does its deliberate, slow-paced first half.  The second half picks up once the titular character joins forces with the journalist to track down an elusive serial killer.  Rooney Mara shoots to stardom as the unconventional leading lady--a multi-pierced, tattooed, antisociable computer hacker--a role that garnered her a Best Actress Oscar nod.  Mara certainly dominates the film in her edgy, complex performance.  Daniel Craig is a competent, if unexciting, actor who suffers the James Bond curse---its hard to separate his 007 persona from his other roles.  I found it hard to be impressed with this performance as I did in his recent films like DREAM HOUSE and COWBOYS AND ALIENS.  Oscar winner Christopher Plummer, the always imposing Stellan Skarsgardm and the elegant Joely Richardson round out the supporting cast.  Yorick van Wanginingen as Mara's repulsive money manager is especially convincing.  The rape scenes are some of the most disturbing in recent cinema.

She was incredible adds a loud dynamic to a story that is bathed in a moody grey atmosphere.  This is a thriller with great suspense almost like an Agatha Christie novel.  There are two scenes that are difficult to watch and they happen in the first 45 mins, but other than that this is a straight forward mystery.  Daniel Craig is a journalist who is asked to write a book, but uncovers much more that involves possible murder.

The characters are pretty close to their original literary counterparts and even though the ending was changed up a bit, it stuck much closer to the source material than the previous adaptation. This Blu-ray release has top-notch video and audio, and has hours of bonus features that I can't wait to watch. Personally, I like this film better than the Swedish adaptation, but to each his/her own. I am a little bummed that we're getting an Ultra Violet copy instead of a normal digital copy, but I think I'll manage just fine without it. And for those who were confused about how the DVD looks like a DVD-R, that's kind of the whole point (it's in the film and the subsequent novels), and plus it's easily recognizable that it's an actual DVD (just look on the right-hand side where it says it's a DVD, is rated R, etc.).

The original goes into so much more depth than the time alloted for the U.S. version that it lets the story unfold.  If we hadn't seen the original we would have been lost for the story was so chopped up that it barely made any sense.  If you have the time see the original trilogy - - if not don't waste your time.

4226332,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Now, just a few years ago, the world was taken by storm by the Swedish-language film adaptation of this incredibly successful book (which I have not read yet), and the world was taken similarly by storm by Noomi Rapace, playing the intense, fierce and wholly independent Lisbeth Salander. It's a good film with a great performance by Rapace, and that has translated to high profile roles in English-Speaking cinema now, with a major role in the most recent SHERLOCK HOLMES film and the main character in this summer's upcoming PROMETHEUS.

Now, aside from a few films (PANIC ROOM and THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON), David Fincher has always hit the mark (SE7EN, THE GAME, THE SOCIAL NETWORK, FIGHT CLUB), or came as close as he could (ALIEN 3). Like all of his great films, this is a film packed with amazing performances, and like all of his great films, there's one performance that over-shadows all the others, and with this film, it's Rooney Mara, again as Salander. However, the major difference between the Swedish film and the English film (other than the different languages) is the power of the film. Where I was left feeling somewhat empty after viewing the Swedish version, I felt totally fulfilled by Fincher's film, adapted by Steven Zaillian, one of Hollywood's premier wordsmiths, and performed with versatility and power by its cast, again with Mara at the forefront, but other than the rather forgettable supporting performances by the Swedish film's cast, such as Michael Nyquist playing a too-stilted Mikael Blomkvist, here for the part of Blomkvist, we have Daniel Craig, who is a far superior actor to Nyquist, and shows the versatility, charm and intelligence of the role. I feel that Craig was pretty short-changed as far as any of the acclaim of the film is concerned, as was Stellan Skarsgaard, playing Martin Vanger with great skill. Also short-changed is Fincher's skill as a director. While I didn't really care for ALIEN 3 as a whole, I felt that Fincher had an interesting enough vision, and he more than exceeded my expectations for that vision with SE7EN, which is strangely kind of a companion piece to this film. But if anything, Fincher's skill behind the camera has only grown since then, and this film shows him possibly as his height as he manages to make this a whole and complete film that can stand alone, despite the two other parts of Larsson's MILLENIUM trilogy. Hopefully, Sony Pictures will look at the eventual returns of this film that include home video sales and will conclude that Fincher, Mara and Craig should return for the sequels.",1332633600,,2592,4.890909090909091

4226335,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Trying to adapt a novel after it's already been done by someone else (and done well I might add) can be a challenge; do you make the same artistic choices? If not, what do you change in your approach to the film? David Fincher's version of Stieg Larrson's novel The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is a rarity in Hollywood--it's a film that adapts the same source and is every bit as good (if not better) than the first version done.

I'm not going to summarize the plot here--enough people have done that quite well. Instead, I'm going to focus on the image quality and special features for the Blu-ray set.

This is a dark and foreboding film filled with a sense of dread early on (which isn't a surprise given that it's from the director of ""Se7en"" and ""Fight Club""--I wouldn't count on Fincher ever tackling a light comedy).

The transfer to Blu-ray is demo quality--blacks are inky and rich looking (particularly noticeable during the opening titles for the film)and detail remarkably sharp with unusually good depth as well.

The sound is spectacular with a rich lossless presentation.

We get an intelligent commentary track from Fincher discussing everything from the nuts and bolts of making the film to his approach to the material. Interestingly, Fincher was given the novel by producer Kathleen Kennedy before the original film version and Fincher (Kennedy gave it to him because she felt it fit his strengths as a film director) didn't read it at the time believing it would never be bought or opitoned by Hollywood nor that it would become a bestseller in the U.S.

The bulk of the special features are on the second disc for the Blu-ray set.

We also get exhaustive special features on the production of the film. ""Characters"" focuses on the three key characters of the film focusing on the casting with Lisbeth and Martin getting the Lion's share of featurettes (six)vs. a measely four for Blomkvist.

We also get a variety of featurettes on shooting on location in Sweden and shooting in the U.S.--these run roughly 100 minutes on the disc. A four part documentary also highlights the post-production and ADR process for the film. There is also a very good featurette on the creation of the disturbing main titles (which reminded me of a very vivid, disturbing Bond-like opening sequence interesting since Daniel Craig stars in the film).

The extras continue with a featurette on the promotional aspect of the film focusing on an ""Inside Edition"" styled TV program. It's both fascinating and hilarious as it manages to parody shows like ""Inside Edition"".

The third disc is a DVD copy of the film which has artwork to make it look like a homemade DVD-R with the title written in black marker across the top (as if Lisbeth had made this bootleg herself). It's a clever touch. The only extra on the DVD is Fincher's commentary track.

For those who hate Ultraviolet you can continue to hate it more as there is an Ultraviolet passcode included and that's the only ""digital"" copy available for this film to upload on your computer. My advice if you dislike Ultraviolet is (which has some severe limitations and issues for many people)is to carry around the DVD edition if you're going to watch it on your laptop (you're out of luck when it comes to an iPad or pad-like device as the Ultraviolet streaming edition is the only option and the coupon expires in 2013 on my copy).

""The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo"" remains a rarity; a film that adapts a foreign novel that was already made into a movie previously AND creates a dread-filled film that equals (and in my opinnion surpasses) the previous version of the film.

Highly recommended.",1332633600,,3650,4.756329113924051

4226368,2,B003Y5H5HO,"Could be spoilers in here... if anything could really ""spoil"" this non-plot movie. Two stars for the actors, even with the atrocious accents. None for the rest of it.

I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The movie should have been called, ""Guy who knows a girl with a tattoo."" Or maybe, ""Guy With Bad Judgement Skills."" I have not read the book, nor have I seen the Swedish version, so I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and I did not develop any connection with the characters as the movie progressed, other than protectiveness towards the girl, who's body language (but not really anything else she did) reminded me of my autistic brother. I think the director did a poor job of conveying any plot, character development, or mystery. And honestly, is Sweden really like that? A ward of the state at 23? No psychologist visits, therapists, something? If so, I am really, really glad I do not live there. I have tattoos and am fairly antisocial, I would hate to be put in an insane asylum for being slightly different from your average Jane. And just as glad I am not walking around with people who set people on fire for no reason. (They do not say in the movie there was any motivation other than insanity to her act).

The mystery in the movie was boring as well. I did not find myself drawn in at all. I had figured out what happened to the girl, (not who did it. they don't give enough information for that), before they even finished telling who was on the island. I never felt any sense of connection with the victims of the killer, they don't give you any information on them other than they died, and broke some biblical taboo. There is no sense of looking in the killer's head either. Why did he do it? Why was he so obsessed with that section of the bible. Was it because he was a Nazi? The rest of the family didn't seem to care they had Nazi officers in their family, seems rather proud of it to me, even though they did not seem antisemitic in any other way. Why did they all hate each other so much? There are so many unresolved plot points it's ridiculous.

The violent rape scenes are not edgy in any way, violence is easy, and the second one was over the top. While I realize they are in the books (from reading other reviews), their lack of context in the movie make the visual completely unnecessary. (Yeah, she's been victimized her whole life. However, you don't know this from the movie, you have to learn it from other sources.) Later on she says she set her father on fire. Never says why. It was very poorly done. The actual rape could have been alluded to with just sound (and no, they did not have to be that graphic. I left until they were over. I am rarely so enraged by a movie). I have no plans of ever watching this again, nor of seeing the next two.

I could go on and on... but I won't.

I'm sure there are a lot of people who will jump on here extolling the virtues of the book, the other version, etc. I am just not interested in reading them, or seeing it, though I usually like foreign movies. I read many good books, and I am sure there are many more I have missed. I just don't think this is one of them. If you want to read some good mysteries (real mysteries. you know, with a plot, motivations... evidence being revealed piece by piece) with female empowerment, and overcoming the horrors of a tragic past, the Eve Dallas books are wonderful. Or ""The Revenge of the Radioactive Lady"" which I found to be engrossing, and a good take on Asperger's, and Alzheimer's, as well as a very good mystery as to the main characters motivations.",1332633600,10,3648,4.343108504398827

Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a pretty good movie. I found it to be unique in its own way and never found myself bored at any point. Its one of the better movies I've seen in a while, but its not perfect either.

The movie has some interesting sex scenes so those that are easily offended should not bother watching the movie.

I enjoyed the opening cinematic with music from Trent Reznor. It had a slightly James Bond feel to it.

Rooney Mara did a great job playing the character Lisbeth. It was interesting to see her ability to look like a mostly unattractive goth chick in one part of the movie to being absolutely gorgeous in another part. I finished the movie wondering how crazy she really was and how much of it was just an act. She really had the standout role in this movie and easily overshadowed anything Daniel Craig did.

The overall storyline of the rich family was a little weak, but served its purpose. It did feel like the director was trying to jam as much as possible onto the screen at times as we flew back and forth between different parts of the plot though this wasn't done so much that it ruined the movie. There were no real surprises when it came to who the killer was in the end, but it was fun to watch the story lead up to the discovery.

The ending was a little sad. We may be left unsure how crazy Lisbeth really is, but you can see she is a sad, lonely girl. She finally finds a decent guy to open up to, and then it all falls apart for her right at the end. You are really left hoping she gets her fairy tale ending at some point in the future as the rest of the story plays out in future movies.

4226396,2,B003Y5H5HO,"I first caught a look at this story a few years ago when I chanced to watch the original Swedish feature.  It piqued my interest, so I took the opportunity to watch the two sequels and enjoyed them as well.  I will admit that I am a foreign film addict.  I enjoy listening to the language and don't mind subtitles at all, but mostly I enjoy them because they simply offer a fresher viewpoint than most of the crap that comes out of Hollywood. That being said, here are my thoughts on the American version:

I thought the opening titles were the worst part of the film. It was too long, too loud, and had little relevance to the film. While I found Noomi Rapace somewhat psychotically endearing in the Swedish version, Rooney Mara came off as nasty to me, nothing to like about her at all. Lisbeth was more than just strange, she had feelings as well.  Craig brought none of the subtle humor found in the Nyqvist charachter that was present in the other version.  Though it followed the book more closely for the most part, the ending seemed like it was a hasty endeavor, as if everyone was bored with the project and wanted a quick wrap on it.  That to me is the fatal flaw in my view.

A word about the rape scene that has repelled so many is in order.  Firstly, the real title of the story was ""Men Who Hate Women"" and that scene certainly reflects that.  Secondly, this story is part of a trilogy and that act by Lisbeth's guardian is central to all three parts of the whole story. Taking it out of the film would be like taking the concentration camps out of Schindler's List.

So, unless you like the typical Hollywood technical dazzle, I would recommend the extended Swedish version (and while you are at it, watch all three parts) for the complete evolution of Lisbeth Salander.  You will be much more satisfied.",1332547200,5,1819,4.413173652694611
4226397,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Despite any reservations a viewer might have about a prompt English version re-make of a very successful Swedish film still popular in this country - the first novel in author Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, namely GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO - this version of Larsson's story is immensely successful.  Much of that is due to the tightly woven screenplay by Steven Zaillian and the extraordinary direction by one of our most gifted directors, David Fincher (Fight Club, The Social Network, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Seven, etc). But also the gifts of the musical composers Trent Reznor and Atticus  Ross (with a bit of help from a very well placed Morten Lauridson's `Lux Aeterna') and the bitingly vivid cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth. Add to that one of the finest collection of actors ever to collaborate on a project and the result is a film that is so engrossing that its very long length doesn't seem long enough!

Everyone knows the story by now: disgraced journalist, Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), escapes to an island in Sweden at the request of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to investigate the 40 year absence of his niece Harriet. The Vanger family is as dysfunctional and bitterly cruel an ensemble as could be imagined and everyone on the island wants Mikael to leave.  The case fascinates Mikael and he gains access to the services of an associate, the very bizarre and brilliant pierced, tattooed, punk computer hacker named Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). As they work together in the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander uncover immense corruption beyond anything they have ever imagined. There are indelible characters along the way: the disgustingly sadistic Nils Bjurman (a brilliant role for Yorick van Wageningen) who mistakenly sexually abuses Lisbeth who in turn has her own manner of revenge), the wily Martin Vanger (Stellan Skarsgrd), a brief but impressive Dragan Armansky (Goran Visnjic), Anita Vanger (Joely Richardson), Inspector Morelli (Donald Sumpter) etc etc etc.  Every role is cast so carefully that there is never a missed beat in this huge ensemble.

For those who love the Swedish version of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO this English version will surely satisfy.  They are different but for this viewer the English version is far more memorable.  There is considerable frank sexual activity, torture, animal abuse, and there are some gruesome scenes: they add and must be there.  Kudos to all concerned. And yes, Rooney Mara really is that fine!

4226398,4,B003Y5H5HO,"I did not feel as much of a compulsion to see the American version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', as I did with the Swedish film. How could this newer version ever compare to the exquisite Swedish version? However, was there ever a more perfect Lisbeth than Rooney Mara, she completely won me over.

In the Swedish version, we were given the bleak, white/black doomed version of the Swedish countryside and the personalities of its inhabitants. It seems they were good or evil. In the American film, Rooney Mara brings the isolation and complete vulnerability of Lisbeth. Maybe it was that in this version, Lisbeth's story is told from a different standpoint, it is her version without the complication of Mikael Blomkvist's character. We could feel her distance, emotionally and physically. She is alone, she isolates herself from her sexual partners as well as those who she deals with. Lisbeth does not smile, not does she make much of an expression at any time. Rooney Mara was able to take this character and give us this added dimension. It is not until she starts working with Mikael, who likes her and trusts her, that she will finally reveal some emotion, but it is not complete trust, nor should it be. It is Lisbeth's story that interests us. Mikael Blomkvist is interesting, but it is an added attraction. Daniel Craig did a great job, but he was missing the vulnerability and lack of confidence that I knew Mikael from the novel.

This American version was so well done, that it had an edge in my book. What I did miss was the Swedish language and the sub titles, somehow they added to the mystery of these characters. Christopher Plummer was the perfect Henrik Vanger. Of course, Christopher Plummer is perfection in any of his roles. The other characters were well done and did not separate themselves in much fashion. I did not find Robin Wright as convincing as Erika Berger, she did not give off the sexuality that I felt from the Swedish version.

This film stands alone as a great film, but it is Rooney Mara who makes this film. She is all of the superlatives, and I felt a deep connection to her character. I hope we see her again in the second and third version of the trilogy.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-24-12

So, that said, let me compare apples to apples:  this version is actually quite well done and not that different from the Swedish edition.  Daniel Craig was the biggest surprise to me.  Unlike his neanderthal performances in, say, ""Elizabeth"" and the James Bond outings, here Mr. Craig exudes a more contrained, muted and refined version of the Blomkvist character.  I actually believe this to be his finest performance to date.  As for Roony Mara, well, she nails Lisbeth with a bit less grunge than Ms. Rapace conjured up.  Still, quite exciting to watch.  Overall, this version is not as atmospheric as the Swedish verson, in my opinion.

Over all I enjoyed this version over the Swedish version and hope they decided to remake The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest as well.",1332374400,20,919,4.539393939393939
4226442,3,B003Y5H5HO,"Okay, I really don't understand what the point of this was... I saw the original, and it was pretty good (4 stars)... This, is pretty much the exact same movie, just with famous Actors. __ Very little (if anything) was changed -- so again, I have to ask, why bother?... To re-do a movie, tit for tat, just to have it done in English... is Not a good enough reason to re-do a movie.

If you haven't seen the original, then yes, this would (otherwise) rate 4 Stars as well (because it's the same damn thing, just with different actors & a slightly more attractive ""Dragon Girl"", aka ""Lizbeth"") ___ But I would absolutely love to know who was stupid enough to PAY to have this movie produced... why a guy like David Fincher would waste his time making an English (language) Mirror-Copy... and who would actually pay money to buy this (or worse, buy theater tickets, if more than 1)... when you can see this, and the other 2 movies (of the trilogy), any time you want, 'Streaming' via Netflix, and so on (or even by free-download from various, nefarious, sites)!!?? ___ WHAT A WASTE, IN EVERY RESPECT.

The ONLY reason *Anyone* says, ""I liked it maybe a little more than the original""... is as I said above... because it's in English, Name/Famous Actors, and More Attractive ""Lizbeth""/""Dragon-Girl""..... those are literally the ONLY differences between the movies... and therefore, the only reason anyone would like it more than the original -- but again -- still doesn't justify making this movie.
-- Likewise, most people who would say, ""The original is more suspenseful""... Well, that's the drawback to 'Suspense' films... once you've seen it, it's never as suspenseful in later viewings (or in 'mirror-image', English versions).  By itself, this is just as suspenseful as the original... so long as you haven't seen the original, and don't know what's coming, and so on.

PS: Regarding my earlier statement, ""I would love to know why a guy like David Fincher would waste his time making this""... LOL... Well, he did make ""The Social Network"" (talk about waste of money & film)... but come on, an interpretation of an interpretation; or mirror-image w/ different cast... Seems to me he can't come up with anything remotely original & intriguing (like Se7en and Fight Club were), so he's taking ""jobs"" that he knows will be successful, as long as he turns in half decent work. _ I for one, miss the old, *Creative*, David Fincher. __ The most creative thing about this movie (and the only Different thing, vs. the original), was the ""Opening Credit Sequence""...

The performances by Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara save the film. But, the film spends too much time with talking heads; shocker exploitation moments; and travelog vistas  ...  and too little time with coherent plot development. The key elements of the story are present. But that is just what it looks like .... key moments stitched together, without coherent development; transitions: a series of broken segues.

Perhaps, if I hadn't seen the Swedish version, first; I would have expected less.

Never has a story captivated me as much as these books since The Lord of the Rings.

Instead (spoiler alert!), the bad guy clumsily gets himself killed during a (very) brief car chase, it turns out that Anita is Harriet (I still don't know what happened to Anita), and Lisbeth completely destroys Mikael's Ponzi-scheming nemesis with practically no effort (she just hacks his computer, and he flees the country). The whole conclusion is too easy, the bad guys are too weak.

4226473,3,B003Y5H5HO,"I thought the opening credit-imagery was FIRST CLASS and AWARD WINNING

The original had a jarring, edgy quality such that when Lisbeth [ SPOILER ALERT ]- in the original -  was first raped orally, you felt the violation. In this new version, the rape scenes are done well; technically superior to the old, but in the original the camera angle from near and behind the man's buttocks as he drags her head onto his front still makes the viewer gag. Rooney is great as she exposes little by little the horror in understanding what he wants, and is totally competent here.
It's the DIRECTION THAT FAILS: In the new one,  when a man is trapped burning in a car, Lisbeth is nearby, but the car  just ""blows up""! In the older version, Lisbeth has a chance to save him... and does not, allowing him to watch her watch him burn alive. So, why in this new one - even have the scene of the car exploding into fire? What was the purpose of her standing there? IMHO, Fincher missed the whole point of the scene, or  is he trying to foist a gentler Girl on us? . by making a non-statement? Same thing with the original showing Lisbeth murdering the father. How could a director pass up a scene in which a sexually abused girl drenches her drunken, rapist father in gasoline, he awakens, realizes, stares at her, a 9-year old holding a match, and she tosses it on him. Hello, David Fincher, where are you? and I had trouble following all those ""Vanger-rlationships."" He cud have had the girl put in animating Power-point type creative slides showing the relationships to bring the viewer to understand pretty complex who's who amongst that family.
In the original, after Blomvkist and the girl have sex, he appeals to her to stay and sleep with him; ""I want to be close to you,"" he tells her, and so Lisbeth faces this reversal of the man sincerely wanting the cuddling and she wanting to remain aloof. Where are you here, Fincher? He just blew these great dramatic situations off, and made a ""blandular"" remake. Why? I can only think to build up $team for 2 more sequels, such as are in the Trilogy. If so, I hope he gets some guts into the next one.

Minus one star for the changes/omissions that I believe took away from the story.  Plus, another one star for the rushed feeling that the movie had.

I admit I was expecting to have nightmares after I saw it, and to my shock I did not.  Though that doesn't mean I still could in the future.

I thought that Rooney Mara did a FANTASTIC JOB as Lisabeth Salander, though I won't pretend I fully understood her character.  Let's just say you probably have to read the books to learn more about her and  her past, though I'm afraid to read them.  If it's anything like that rape scene, I don't know how much I could take.  I barely made it through.  I hope that the Anerican's do make the other two so I can see more of the story, but like I said, after that rape scene I was on edge for the entire rest of the movie.

Both versions of the movie had their quirks. For example, in the Swedish version, Lisbeth seemed a bit too ""sociable."" The book described her as being socially awkward (to say the least), bordering on autistic. In this version, I liked that the director stuck closely to the book's description of her. If you haven't read the books prior to seeing this movie, you may be somewhat confused. I'd heard reviews from friends who'd seen the movie and they didn't like it; they found the plot difficult to follow. I can see how this can be.

SPOILER CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW
I love and I mean love this book. I love the Swedish version (both regular and extended versions). I literally watched all 9 hours in a row and then watched TGWTDT a second time. I can not express my love of these characters esp Lisbeth. So I was excited to have an American version even though I thought it was unneccesary. Boy was I wrong. I don't know what they were thinking with the script. As much as I want to blame that bratty actress Rooney Mara for a bad portrayal, she looked the part though her characterization was a flat as a coca cola on a hot summer day. She didn't spark, she didn't have the strength of character needed. It I don't know if it her or how awful the script was. They never even attempted to explain Lisbeth other than she was troubled. No background was given. She was more of a freak brat with violent tendencies than the strong willed, brilliantly flawed, damaged woman she is the books/movies. She is supposed to not care about what other think, have a strong moral (even though they are her rigid morals) code and fiercely loyal. She is none of those things in this version. She actually asks permission to kill a man! WTF? She was actually told not to kill him in the book and she would damn well do I if she felt like it. I wanted to throw up when that happened. I cried at how bastardizated this version of her was and how unlike able she was portrayed.
Anyway, Daniel Craig was ok. He was no Michael Nyqvist but he was alright. Also flat and one note. Couldn't have cared less about him if I had tried.
The whole turning point in the book and Swedish movie is the rape scenes. This is supposed to be brutal and violent. Both the oral and later full on rape. It is suppose to help explain how Lisbeth is constantly victimized (esp earlier in her life) and how strong she is when she turns the tables. That should even be more shocking that her being raped. But in this movie it seems to be thrown it because it has to be included and it is not shocking or much of anything because we dot know or care much for Lisbeth because the writers/director hasn't made us care. Rooney is too stoic. Lisbeth was like a quiet storm. Even when she is not saying a word, she speaks volumes and yells it without a word.
To be honest besides the screwy plot and crap added from the second book that was weirdly thrown it and made no sense, this movie failed horribly. If you didn't know the story, then it is confusing. Heck I read the whole series and didn't understand this movie. But hands down the part that creeped me out the most was watching Lisbeth and Blomkvist together. It was weird. It made me feel dirty and I even threw up a little. It was nasty. There was no chemistry. It felt more like what I should have felt when she was raped but I felt violated for her.
This was not acceptable. These were not my beloved characters. This was a sell out and I am begging them to leave it alone and do not make anymore of the series. I beg you to walk away.
If you truly love the book, I encourage you to watch the Swedish version (regular or extended) and then you will see what this movie should have been. While it doesn't flow the book exactly, it also doesn't butcher the characters like this one.",1332288000,19,3485,4.273827534039334

Noomi Rapace came exceedingly close. Rooney Mara is a completely different Lisbeth but is equally as compelling. The contrast in performance is as varied, multi-faceted, and perplexing as the character they portray. Noomi Rapace was more the restrained violent, angsty side of Lisbeth. Rooney Mara better captures the hidden vulnerability and need to be seen as a person aspect. I liked the rest of the cast, particularly Robin Wright Penn as Erika Berger.

4226550,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Let's face it: David Fincher's at his best when he's trying to creep us out.  He can give us a character-study drama about building an online empire (THE SOCIAL NETWORK), or a fantasy about Brad Pitt aging backwards for some reason (BENJAMIN BUTTON), but Fincher works best in the real of the thriller: SE7EN still remains (in this reviewer's opinion) his strongest, most fully-conceived film, with FIGHT CLUB and ZODIAC ranking pretty high up there.  THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO falls into this mind-freak category, with genuine thrills (even for those who've read the book and seen the original film), some solid performances, a fantastic script, incredible visuals and sound--basically, everything you've come to expect from a Fincher thriller.

The plot is far from simple; as with the first film, this movie bogs down in the novel's convoluted story (following two protagonists, going back and forth in time, lingering on subplots that could easily have been trimmed).  It's basically the story of disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (a subtle and engaging Daniel Craig), who is hired by billionaire Henrik Vanger (a regal Christopher Plummer, in the midst of a late-career resurgence) to solve the decades' old murder of his niece.  Along the way, Blomkvist recruits tough-but-vulnerable girl Lisabeth Salander (a very capable, occasionally surprising Rooney Mara) who has a knack for computer hacking and revenge.

DRAGON TATTOO, for you newcomers, is basically what THE GODFATHER would have been if it were a techno-thriller-mystery.  Which probably makes no sense.  That's okay; you'll either love this film for its pseudo-gothic vibes, or hate it for its forced overtones of darkness.  One thing everyone can agree on are the performances, from the two leads to the stellar supporting cast: Robin Wright, Stellan Skarsgard, Joely Richardson, even the grossly-overlooked Julian Sands in a wordless flashback role (talk about wasted talent, but he makes the most of it).  The script, too, is top-notch; Steve Zaillan's penned everything from MONEYBALL to GANGS OF NEW YORK, and he still keeps finding new tricks up his sleeve.  Kudos must also be heaped upon Fincher's ever-reliable cohort Trent Reznor, for providing a killer soundtrack.  (Oh, and at least watch the film for the opening credits sequence; think Bond in Hell.)

Stieg Larsson's original novel was a very well-written and engaging tome, if a bit overlong and meandering (it could have been half its length and still been okay); the American film version trims the fat a little (it's still over 2.5 hours long), but falls to many of the same inconsistencies.  Why, then, the five stars?  Because of the way Fincher and company overcome the challenges.  It's not a crime classic in the way that SE7EN is, and probably never will be.  But there's a lot here to love (or hate, as many will, for a wide variety of reasons, many of them legitimate), and for Fincher's growing legions of fans, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO will go down as a particular favorite.",1332201600,,3037,5.1030303030303035

4226600,4,B003Y5H5HO,"I remember the hype when Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy first became popular, so I was a bit surprised to see David Fincher's version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo perform somewhat badly in theaters. Did it underperform because the 2009 Swedish version satisfied people's desire to see the series on the big screen, or are people just tired of the whole thing?

Before I talk about the movie, I have to mention the opening title sequence. It's just stunning. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross adapt Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song and give it a more modern feel. It perfectly sets the mood for what is to come.

The story initially focuses on journalist Michael Blomkvist (Craig). We see him lose a libel case and most of his money in the process. He receives an offer from Henrik Vanger (Plummer) who offers to double his salary if he'll investigate who killed his granddaughter, Harriet. Blomkvist feels that he can't do the work alone and so he enlists the help of Lisbeth Salander (Mara), who was hired by one of Vanger's employees to investigate Blomkvist before the offer was made.

It's here that the movie differs from the usual offerings within the crime investigation genre. The reason is Salander. She's easily the most interesting character in the story and is highly unconventional. She's considered unstable and perhaps insane and is monitored by a legal guardian. She's covered in piercings and tattoos and refuses to display any social skills whatsoever. Salander is deeply troubled and extremely hard to like when we first meet her.

The movie isn't for everyone. It features a rape scene and another in which Salander is forced to perform sexual favors. Other scenes show torture, a dismembered animal and unpleasant photographs of murdered women.

The story itself is a fairly straightforward search for the person who killed Harriet. We quickly learn that she wasn't the only victim. Salander has an eidetic memory and a gift for hacking into people's computers, while Blomkvist investigates in a more conventional way. They actually make a good team.

The suspects are the other members of Henrik Vanger's extended family, so that's where the investigation begins. The running time is a little over two-and-a-half hours and it does lack momentum at times, but it was gripping enough to hold my interest throughout. Don't expect a huge amount of action, although the final act does include a few thrills.

Many will compare Fincher's version to the Swedish version released in 2009. I own both and the difference between the two is minimal. There's slightly more urgency to the original version and it seems raw in comparison to Fincher's polished version. It's tricky buying into certain characters when the actor is known for other roles, and Craig's presence will remind most viewers of his role as James Bond. Indeed, he takes some events in stride as though they happen to him every day.

The movie's appearance is somewhat bleak. The wintry scenes consist of a muted color palette with blacks, whites and grays dominating. The Blu-ray looks and sounds wonderful, and it's apparent that this version had a much bigger budget than the Swedish version.

If you are a fan of the books, you'll likely be very happy with Fincher's adaptation. Mara was convincing as Salander and it's good to see how her character develops throughout the movie. She's slow to trust anyone, and that's understandable given what we know about her life and recent experiences. When someone does earn her trust, she's loyal and is somebody that you would want to be on your side.

I enjoyed this first installment of the Millennium Trilogy, but it could have been better. Although box office numbers were mediocre at best, I think we'll eventually see the other two installments. Will Fincher direct? That remains to be seen.",1332115200,9,3827,4.965625

4226602,3,B003Y5H5HO,"A Hollywood remake of a Swedish movie made just two years ago, is the first part of the best selling trilogy Millennium, by the late Swedish author (and journalist) Stieg Larsson. The plot is mostly about how investigative journalist Michael Blomkvist (clearly an alter ego of Larsson) is asked by Henrik Vanger, an aging captain of industry to solve the murder of his favorite niece forty years ago. By some strange circumstances, he will be helped in the investigation by the pierced, troubled hacker Lisbeth Salander, with whom professional cooperation will soon turn into the personal as they discover the very dark secrets running under the very successful Vanger family. The Hollywood version is also set in Sweden, though here all the characters speak in English.

As much as I like the original movie (I haven't read the books) I must admit that its view of the world is a bit naive, equivalent to an earnest teenager shouting that the whole world is corrupt. In the US version, Blomkvist is played by Daniel Craig (a fine actor who has made a career playing macho guys) as a stronger and more attractive man than in the Swedish movie (where he was played by the older and somewhat chubby Michael Nyqvist). On the other hand, the Lisbeth Salander character is played in the remake by Rooney Mara as a weaker woman than in the original (she might be a fine actress, but she doesn't show it here, despite critical acclaim for her performance). Noomi Rapace made a far stronger impression as Lisbeth in the Swedish movie.

Though there are not major changes in the movie plot, the Hollywood version does make small variations, which I think are generally for the worse. For instance, when Craig tries to understand the meaning of certain numbers that might be a clue to the murder, his daughter, who is a fervent catholic going to a religious camp, alerts him that they are a biblical reference. This scene is unlikely, since there are very few Catholics in Sweden, or very religious people for that matter, as it is a very secular country. In the original version, the character of the daughter does not appear, and is Lisbeth, by surfing in the net, that finds the religious connections.

The director is David Fincher. He has occasionally made fine movies (for instance, Zodiac) but most of the time his work tend to the flashy and empty (Seven, Fight Club), the overrated (The Social Network) if not to the directly mediocre (Benjamin Button). This movie is not totally worthless, but it is disappointing, and it is considerably weaker than the original version.",1331856000,6,2571,4.8122171945701355
4226603,4,B003Y5H5HO,"""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a Hollywood adaptation of Swedish writer Stieg Larsson's mystery novel. The film, of which story is dark and often violent, is directed by David Fincher, who is known for such thriller as ""Se7en"" and ""Zodiac.""

The film is about a Swedish journalist and co-owner of the magazine ""Millennium"" Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), who, after losing a libel case brought against him, sets out to investigate what happened to Harriet Vanger, grandniece of Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), a retired CEO of a family industry, when she suddenly went missing about 40 years ago.

To do so, he enlists a help from a genius computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), who has gone through terrible experiences as you will see in the film. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is more about the luridness of the truths than the process of finding them out, and about the characters who can be very brutal without remorse.

Considering the subject matter, David Fincher is the right choice for making an English-speaking version, though it seems as if the director has lost interest in the film's final 20 minutes or so.

Some nay find the film's English-speaking characters (played by the international cast) in the Swedish setting a bit strange. But perhaps the film would have looked stranger had its story been set in somewhere in America. After all remaking a film is not copying the original, but changing it, so something must go.

With Jeff Cronenweth's effective photography, Fincher's version looks more polished than the Swedish counterpart, though I don't know if it is really a good thing. The 158 minute film is most notable for Rooney Mara's strong acting and director's skills that keep the sinister feeling going on in the film's world.",1331337600,4,1780,4.97979797979798

Let me speculate as to why:  Salander apparently has some version of Asperger's syndrome - high-functioning on the autistic spectrum with occasional genius traits in certain areas.  Mara delivers less susceptibility in interpersonal relationships in some areas and more in others.  Whatever the formula, it is convincingly persuasive.  There are many opportunities for comparison because both movies use many of the same scenes.

I have one big complaint - I disagree with the accolades given to the sound engineers.  No matter what the scene, they attempt to augment the emotion with music and/or background noise.  It's too loud and constant.  At times, these actors already mumble their lines for the sake of their portrayals.  I don't like to miss words of dialogue and it's a distraction.

As a whole the American version fit all of what made the book great into it while the Swedish version cut out mostly everything that didn't have anything to do with the search for Harriet Vanger which was a little disappointing.

4226611,3,B003Y5H5HO,"The major difference between the Swedish version and the American version, is the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.

First: If you read the novels, you know that Lisbeth Salander was only 5 feet tall and weighed 90 lbs.  In the Swedish original, Noomi Rapace is actually 5'3"" tall, and in the American remake Rooney Mara is 5'6"".  Folks, there was a reason author Stieg Larsson made his heroine 5 feet tall.  He wanted this little girl to be a gallon of nitroglycerine read to explode -- like she did when she kicked ass on two Hells Angel types.  This was an essential part of the plot -- that someone so small, could be so violent.  Making her 5'6"" loses this dramatic point.

Second: Facially, in the novels, Lisbeth is not pretty, or would even be considered attractive on any level.  She is described as having a boyish figure and facial piercings.  This is accomplished in the Swedish version with Noomi Rapace -- nude, she is flat chested and her body and face are just so-so.  In bed she is not truly sexy or sensual -- she gets on, gets off, and is finished.  She does not make love.  The Swedish director deliberately cast this actress to accomplish this faithfulness to the novel.  The American director made Rooney Mara look -- at times -- beautiful.  She does not have a boyish body; she has a very young womanly body with normal size breasts. In bed, she is very attractive.  Very sexual, very sensual.  She makes love.  This is not Larsson's Lisbeth.

Third: Psychologically, Lisbeth is an introvert who is filled with hostility.  In the Swedish version, the reporter slowly works his way into her confidence, and she (somewhat) lets her guard down for him.  The American version carries none of Lisbeth's borderline psychosis.  Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth, just ""acts"" like she is pissed off at the world.  It doesn't take much for the reporter to get her into bed.

Conclusion: Stieg Larsson in his triolgy set himself a monumental task:  He asked himself, can I make a small unattractive girl, who is extremely introverted and hostile, and continually acts antisocial and like a bitch -- have the reader (audience) come to like (maybe love) her? This is a girl that we would never sit next to on a crowded bus -- but by the end of the novels (movie) we'd have her over for dinner.  Make no mistake, probably 90% of everyone who saw the Swedish film disliked this obnoxious character from the opening scenes, but by the end of the movie we were rooting for her.  The American version loses this quality of character.  Rooney Mara is tall, attractive, and her Lisbeth is not really super obnoxious or completely introverted.  Once again, her version of the character just ""acts"" pissed off.  The director missed the point.

Sure, see both versions, and maybe read the books.  If you want Lisbeth Salander, you will only find her in the Swedish version.  The reviewers who thought the American version was as good or better than the Swedish version, did not understand the character of Lisbeth.",1330128000,24,3002,4.702495201535509
4226612,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Whether you call it a remake of the 2009 Swedish film or an American adaptation of the novel, this English-language version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has arrived. In the interest of simplicity, I'll refer to it as a remake hence forth. The books by Stieg Larsson are quite popular in America and the Swedish films have been seen by a pretty wide American audience given their foreign nature. I have never read Larsson's books, but I've seen all three of the Swedish films based on them. The films, particularly the first one, are so accessible to the average American moviegoer and are so widely available that an American version just seemed strange and unnecessary. When David Fincher, riding the wave of universal acclaim from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Social-Network/dp/B004HWT6DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Social Network</a>, signed on to direct and cast up-and-coming actress Rooney Mara as the iconic Lisbeth Salander, my doubts were lessened. The announcement that newly minted Oscar-winners Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross would collaborate with Fincher to again provide the score didn't hurt either. There is no use comparing Fincher's version with Niels Arden Oplev's. It's not exactly apples and oranges, but it accomplishes nothing. It's a more effective measure to analyze this on its own merit rather than nitpick and compare every aspect with the film that came before it. Fincher's style is so prevalent that it's easy to believe he didn't take any inspiration from the previous adaptation, having adopted a style and tone for the film that is all his own. If he goes on to direct the sequels, the overall atmosphere alone will make them easy to distinguish from the versions before it. Additionally, I won't say one is better than the other for several reasons. One is that this version is much fresher in my mind and another is my feeling that this version loses an edge because of my familiarity with the story. A lot of suspense or mystery that may have been handled more effectively here may have been lost on me. Regardless, I'll get on with it.

The film quickly sets the tone with Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) receiving a framed drawing of a flower at his home on Hedeby Island. The screen goes dark, Trent Reznor's atmospheric rendition of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song starts in, and the stylized, gritty opening credit sequence begins, hearkening back to Fincher's earlier career directing music videos. Enter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), writer and co-owner of Millennium Magazine, who fears he has ruined his reputation after losing a libel case to a wealthy businessman. Meanwhile, lawyer Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) has commissioned an extensive background check on Blomkvist from Lisbeth Salander, a computer hacker and researcher for a security firm. Her report convinces Frode to introduce Blomkvist to his client Henrik Vanger. Impressed with his investigative reporting skills, Henrik wants Blomkvist to help him solve the 40-year-old murder of his niece Harriet under the guise of helping him write his memoirs. Though a body has never been uncovered, Henrik is convinced that his niece was murdered by someone in his own family. Everyone on the island is suspect and Henrik makes Blomkvist an offer he can't refuse.

The film jumps back and forth between Blomkvist and Salander, who don't team up until quite late into the movie. With a runtime of 160 minutes, there's no real need to rush anything. There's a very memorable, graphic scene in the Swedish version that involves Salander, her guardian, and a tattoo gun. I recall watching this scene, knowing an American version was in the works, and being flabbergasted by it. There was no way I could fathom that scene being depicted in a mainstream American film. The American version of Let the Right One In was too afraid to recreate a single shot for American audiences (if you've seen both versions, you should know the shot), so how was Fincher going to get away with this? To my surprise, he did get away with it and this harrowing, graphic torture scene is just one example of his refusal to sanitize the violent and sexual nature of the film. He promised this would be a hard `R' and he delivered. Never before have I seen an R-rated film and thought `how is this not NC-17?' To see this content play on a movie screen in a large, corporate theatre is a validation of what driven, stubborn directors can do with total control over their vision. A lot of the graphic nudity and violence depicted here in unheard of in a mainstream American film. You'd be lucky if you could find some of this stuff at your local art house theater.

Since Fight Club, Fincher has adopted a unique style that becomes more developed with each passing film. There are several scenes here where he goes full-Kubrick, mastering his grip over the sinister and the ominous. I bring up Kubrick because Fincher has become adept at creating a disconnected atmosphere that casts a spell over the audience. Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth give The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a dark and grungy, yet sophisticated look that takes advantage of Sweden's weather to lend itself to the overall atmosphere. This atmosphere is most potent in flashback scenes, creating a whole separate mood. There are some incredible shots here that should bring Cronenweth richly deserved awards recognition, as this one of the most well shot movies of the year.

Reznor and Ross deliver a score that actually heightens the effect of the material, moving in such perfect sync with the film that they become codependent with one another. I was not as impressed as I was with their work on The Social Network, but it may just have been more subtle or lacked the same freshness. Whatever the case, these two have the potential to do great things for movie music. It comes as no surprise that Fincher has wrangled terrific performances from his cast. Craig makes a great Blomkvist, assured, but not too arrogant. It's a great example of his acting range, as he effortlessly transitions from the fearless James Bond to the confused Blomkvist. Stellan Skarsgrd as Martin Vanger...Damn. An actor with plenty of work under his belt in two countries, he deserves more roles of this sort.

Finally, there's the controversial casting of Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace's earlier performance became so closely associated with the character that people would have been up in arms if she had reprised the role herself. Mara made a big impression with her brief scenes in The Social Network, but this performance shows what she's really capable of. It's a remarkable transformation and she's in total command of the screen when she's on it. With her beauty completely obscured under the strange hair, piercings, and makeup; she's tough, troubled, and fascinating. She's occasionally sexy too, but this comes not from physical attributes, but the confidence in her performance. I'd have to watch the two performances in close proximity to say for sure, but Mara may give a more psychologically complex performance that Rapace. Her performance is brilliant.

Fincher knows of his talent and this film is a more assured directorial effort, especially in regards to his ability at handling drama, suspense, violence, mystery, etc. His talent has made The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo stand as its own film. That's not to say it's perfect, with an epilogue that seems to stretch a bit too long. However, the final scene, a new addition, wraps everything up and has more bite than the Swedish version, making this one pack a more emotional wallop. It's an enthralling film that has carved a place on my top ten for the year, a welcome and different breed from the typical film to find its way onto such a list. The story is a high-minded mystery yarn, tailor-made for this century that would not be the success it is without its memorable female protagonist and the talented filmmakers bringing the story to life. Unlike most of the year's best films, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is little more than supreme, well-made entertainment. I'll be surprised if it's nominated for any Academy Awards beyond acting, directing, photography, and music. Its status as a remake certainly won't help it receive additional accolades. Fortunately, I had high hopes for this and it totally delivered. I hope Fincher goes on to direct the next two installments so I can see what else he has to offer the series. It may not be a ""great movie"" in the traditional sense, but it has all the cinematic ingredients of one, coupled with great entertainment and potent atmosphere. It's nice to see a potential franchise unabashedly geared for adults. I hesitate to call it ""one of the best films of the year,"" but The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of my favorite films of the year and is more of an achievement on a cinematic level than many of the films superior to it.

4226656,4,B003Y5H5HO,"At the time of his death, Swedish author Stieg Larsson was sitting on a trilogy of unpublished novels called the ""Millenium Series"".  His life ended before he was able to see his trilogy about an unorthodox ward of the state surveillance agent named Lisbeth Salander, take off into an international sensation. His novels became best sellers, in 2009 the first of his trilogies was made into a Swedish film called ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and was consequently followed up with two more films, and now the movie has been adapted into an English language film, directed by David Fincher (Seven, Fight Club, The Social Network).

Salander, (Rooney Mara) otherwise, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, has led an abusive life and after her legal guardian suffers a stroke, she is legally assigned to a new guardian, who uses his position and her money as a tool to abuse her even more. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is hard hitting and offensive at times, but such is the beauty of Larsson's writings. We would all like to believe that violence and abuse doesn't exist, but the truth is we choose to ignore it, brush it under the rug and pretend it doesn't.  This is the very theme that resides throughout Larsson's ""Millenium Series"" and throughout ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".

The majority of the movie centers on a 40-year old murder mystery and a fourteen-year old girl who vanished from a prominent family without explanation. Mikael Blomkvist, (Daniel Craig) a magazine publisher, is hired to investigate the crime. Through a course of events, he and Salander become partners into a rich and complicated mystery.
As someone who has seen all of the Swedish films and can give an opinion about the English language version, based on the original, David Fincher has added much to the film. The movie appears to be more in depth and shows more of Lisbeth's character changing throughout. Her harshness softness as the movie goes along and Fincher has chosen to emphasis that more. The movie can feel wordy and long, but during that time, the information and investigation is thoroughly interesting and challenging.

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a breakout film for Rooney Mara, just as it was for Noomi Rapace (Sherlock Holmes 2), who played the title character in the original release. She fought hard for the part and she does it justice. She wears the scars of a troubled past like a glove and is able to shed those things when it is necessary.

I can't say that the new version is better than the original or worse. The truth is, they are both great films because of the subject matter, the richness of the characters and the writing. The new film will certainly bring a larger audience to an already popular series of movies worldwide. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" will most certainly be one that will be mentioned on Oscar night, if only for just Rooney Mara.",1329177600,5,2892,4.750996015936255
4226657,5,B003Y5H5HO,"There's a moment in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (TGWTDT) where hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) seems to ask disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) for permission to commit murder.  That simple phrase sums up the perfect synchronicity of David Fincher's direction, Steven Zaillian's screenplay, and Trent Reznor's score. What kind of a woman asks for permission to kill?

By now the plot of TGWTDT is well-known: When Blomkvsit, co-owner of Millennium magazine loses his libel case against corrupt CEO Hans-Erik Wennerstrom (Ulf Friberg), he is given an opportunity at redemption and revenge by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer). It's a good old fashioned murder mystery; Vanger is obsessed with solving the murder of his grandniece Harriet (Moa Garpendal).  And so, slinking out of the public eye, Blomkvist takes the job and moves onto the family's private island.

Running parallel to Blomkvist's investigation is the tale of Salander. She is a product of the Swedish system, a ward of the state and abused product of the foster system. It doesn't take long before it becomes clear that Lisbeth is as much a ward as a victim; disaffected, detached, practical, and yes violent, she does what any man would do when facing abuse - she punches it in the face.  But because Lisbeth is a thin, pale girl with piercings all over her body, she is demonized and ostracized.  Lisbeth's greatest nemesis is Nils Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), a corpulent, corrupt lawyer who manipulates Lisbeth into performing certain favors on him. And if you know Lisbeth you know this won't end well.

Eventually these two plotlines converge.  Lisbeth provides much needed technical wizardry to Blomkvist's old school investigation. They are united by the opportunity to stop a ""killer of women,"" a foe Lisbeth can certainly relate to.

The crux of TGWTDT is the story of Lisbeth, of Harriet, of all the women who are routinely intimidated and subjugated by men who wield their power without restraint.  Their victims are merely foils, projections for each man's sins, and Lisbeth can't resist the opportunity to help a ghost from 40 years past get redemption.

But back to that question.  It means so many things.  On one level, Lisbeth is still asking permission from men.  On the other, she doesn't need to ask anyone for permission for anything.  Lisbeth is certainly the most dangerous predator in the entire film. So why did she ask Blomkvist the question?

I like to think it was a sign of affection, in the way a lover might ask, ""Can I get you something to drink?"" Or maybe it's a turn-taking request: ""Were you planning on torturing him?"" in the same way you might ask ""Would you like to go first?"" Mara's nuanced performance makes all the difference, and the fact that simple phrase can cause so much controversy is just one example of why The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an excellent film.",1329091200,25,2910,4.95679012345679
4226658,5,B003Y5H5HO,"This is one of the rare cases where the film is actually BETTER than the book. I recommend seeing this even if you've read the book. I have and I've enjoyed it even knowing how it will end.
The movie adds a lot to the experience, but mainly it conveys very well the dark atmosphere of the hard cold winter of northern Sweden and specifically the isolation of the island where this movie main plot is located. The excellent soundtrack from Trent Reznor adds to this as well (the cover to Led Zeppelin's Immegrant Song is stunning!). Also, I think the screen version if much better and more focused on the main storyline, leaving out some details that I thought were a little tedious when reading this book.",1329091200,5,705,4.515625
4226659,5,B003Y5H5HO,"This is an exceptionally good movie.  I saw the Swedish version and liked it.  However, this American adaptation of Stieg Larsson's novel is even better.  It tells more of Larsson's story, and although it doesn't stick strictly to the book I think David Fincher's direction makes the story clearer and ties the various themes together better.  The photography and music greatly enhance the movie, and give a haunting, dark, threatening, yet realistic sense of winter in Sweden that adds to the story-telling and deeply illustrates the themes of psychological and physical/sexual abuse. The editing is fantastic, moving the film along strongly and artistically.  Not a moment is wasted, even though it is nearly 3 hours long. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara are excellent choices for the lead roles, and they interpret their characters with great precision and depth.  Craig's depiction of Blomqvist is really close to Larsson's as he exhibits the journalist's fire and dogged pursuit of his story, as well as the surprise and respect he has for Lisbeth's intellect and weirdness.  Rooney Mara deserves the Oscar nomination for her Lisbeth Salander. I have similar kudos for the rest of the main actors, particularly Christopher Plummer (Henrik Vanger), Stellan Skarsgaard (Martin Vanger), and Yorick Van Waginen (Bjurman).  The opening sequence with the credits is amazing, and some things weren't clear until I'd seen the movie a couple of times---It's not just an artistic introduction with fantastic music, it foretells some theme elements but you don't realize it until after it's over.",1328832000,5,1587,5.26984126984127

Besides, Noomi would kick Roony's you-know-what any day of the week! (I found Roony's performance relatively vacant and unconvincing).  And I could have done without the graphic mutilated cat scene of the American version (even though I assume that must have been in the book).

4226661,5,B003Y5H5HO,"An investigation where there are no clues left to find, little if any cooperation from those around you, any of whom could be the killer you are looking for. What's the plan? Is there one?

  Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig) is co-owner and writer for Millennium magazine and has recently suffered a professional setback that could bankrupt him and his publication. An unscrupulous man with alleged criminal dealings has won a libel suit that might end his career. Soon after, however, Henrik Vanger (played by Christopher Plummer) makes him an offer. Find out who is responsible for the disappearance and likely death of his niece Harriet 40 years earlier. He also believes that whoever's responsible is a member of his family. The family that lives on the same large estate they did during the disappearance and somehow manage to avoid speaking to each other. Blomkvist is promised a substantial salary in addition to evidence that will bring about the demise of the man who brought the libel suit against him. When he asks if he might employ a research assistant, Vanger's (Plummer's) lawyer recommends the woman who did the background check on Blomkvist before they hired him. A troubled loner with a peculiar appearance by the name of Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara).

  Now I have no doubt that the books on which this film and its 2009 Swedish language predecessor were based on are better than the movie. Not because I've read them. In actuality, I haven't read a book since high school. But since people who do read the books first ALWAYS say that the book is better, then it must be the case. It couldn't possibly be an effort on their part to sound and feel superior. Putting that aside, Craig as Blomkvist was a surprisingly wise choice and Plummer, along with others, make for an intriguing, albeit despicable Vanger family. But the real star is Rooney Mara as the brilliant, beautiful, and unstable Lisbeth. Despite a few small roles in other films and guest appearances in numerous television series, Mara's most recognized for her performance in The Social Network. That role was child's play compared to Lisbeth. This is truly a breakout performance that, one would hope, could bring a slew of bigger roles and a long successful career.",1328486400,3,2271,4.885714285714286

Just as amazing as it was the first time, this movie combines superb directing, art direction, musical score, and acting for a complete package that delivers.  When I heard that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were scoring this film, I became interested in the movie instantly. This spark was fueled insanely by the first teaser trailer that was released in the Summer of 2011. After seeing the trailer, I went out and got the book, read it, and was insanely excited to see how it would be brought to life. Months passed, and after reading the book and listening to the full 3 hour score multiple times, the movie came out. What I watched was nothing short of a mesmerizing, dark, immensely detailed story that captivated my imagination. The entire cast gives fantastic performances, but nobody delivered like Rooney Mara did in bringing Lisbeth Salander to life. Her portrayal displayed how I viewed Ms. Salander, as described by the book, with about 100% accuracy. In regards to comparing this film to the Swedish film, I will speak from an unbiased viewpoint whereas I have read the book and seen both movies. When it comes down to it, the American film is by far more accurate to the book.  There's a few minor changes and a decently major change that improved (in my opinion) the movie's resolution, but other than that, a very faithful representation of the original story.

4226664,4,B003Y5H5HO,"Tonight I went to see the American version of the movie ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", which is a remake of the excellent Swedish movie of the same name, which was based on the outstanding book of the same name written by Stieg Larsson.  I'm pretty certain that I was captivated by the story since I have the Larsson trilogy  in hard cover, Kindle edition, Audible edition as well as owning the Swedish movies (which I have watched in both the English dubbed version and the subtitled version).

I waited for weeks before going to see the American version, because we Americans tend to go for the heavy action and drama and sex and violence while forgetting the story.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Since this is a blog and not a movie review, I will talk about the story and characters first.

Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are two of the most interesting characters ever written.  There is something so compelling about each.

Lisbeth is a world class computer hacker with a photographic memory who may have some form of autism.  She has a complex past that is not unveiled in the first book, but we are given hints based upon her being a ward of the state, requiring a guardian to oversee her financial and personal life.  While many say she anti-social, I see her as asocial.  And she is a very strong, unique female who depends only upon herself for survival.

Mikael is a brilliant journalist who is fiercely dedicated to the moral fight against unscrupulous businesses.  He is incorruptible, and has many affairs without emotional attachment.  He is one of the few people to see Lisbeth for who she is, and not as she presents herself to the world.

About the movies.  Had I not read the books, or seen the Swedish films, I would like have rated the American version very highly.  It was an excellent thriller.  It just didn't have the bite of the original and the characters were missing the depth that make them so unique.

The American Remake
The Good:
Filmed in Sweden, which maintained the authenticity of the story.
Some of the actors were simply excellent.

The Bad:
The opening with the credits was just weird.
The score was so loud throughout the movie that it was often difficult to hear what the actors were saying.

The Strange:
The movie at times held tightly to the story as written by Larsson, while other aspects were changed completely with no value added to the film.  It felt that the makers of the American film wanted to change something, anything, to make it unique.

The Comparison:
Original Swedish film
* Noomi Rapace captured Lisbeth perfectly,showing both her strength and vulnerability - she is very much a mystery
* Focused more on Blomkvist, his personal relationships, the Wennerstrom affair, problems at Millennium
* The musical score was so right for the movie it is virtually unremarkable
* Michael Nyqvist portrays Blomkvist as an ethical and moral balance to Lisbeth's questionable hacker practices
* Harriet - story remains true to the book
* Lisbeth's history is unknown, making the character even more interesting
**** Outstanding

American remake

* Rooney Mara was too chatty for Lisbeth, and showed none of the vulnerability - more of a cold robotic figure who is a badass
* Ignored prison time for Blomkvist.  Like the legal system just forgot?
* The musical score was amazing, but too loud and better suited to a musical CD
* Daniel Craig looks gorgeous, but the character is somewhat bland and is secondary to Lisbeth in this film
* Harriet's story is not only left out, but rewritten in a way that loses the impact
* Chatty Lisbeth gives us her history, lessening the impact of the story

4226665,1,B003Y5H5HO,"Without the previous Swedish version I would probably be less critical.  Everything that this version does differently is to its detriment.  Subtleties are gone, the story is confused and give the impression that the director did not know himself what was happening.  While I was riveted watching the Swedish version, I kept looking on my watch to see when the movie would end.  Things that should be left to the viewer are spelled out--just how dumb does Hollywood think all viewers are!  For example, Lisbeth does not fail to point out right away that she videotaped the rape using a fiber optics camera!  The sappy ending is pathetic!  Mara does a decent job but is no match for the stunning Rapace!  Craig is completely out of place as a journalist.

I won't go into anymore detail than that because i don't want to ruin the movie for some people, so i'll simply say it was a decent remake and i can't wait for the other two movies to come out in theaters, but at this moment i feel that the Swedish verson of the first film is superior. 3.5 stars",1328140800,7,616,4.412280701754386

Obviously, I was aware of these versions.  However, I was perhaps wary that Hollywood was attempting to recreate something so soon after the original.

Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"".  I found it to be dark, brooding and totally engrossing.  Time flew by.  I find that this is often one of the best indicators of a film's worth.

The plot is probably well known to most.  I will not be repeating details nor, obviously, trying to compare it with the book or the original film.  Nonetheless, I can comment upon the cast and the broader screenplay.  In this regard, I found the lead actors to be excellent.  Rooney Mara as the rebellious and abused computer genius is a revelation.  She really does dominate the film.  Daniel Craig as the male lead, Mikael Blomkvist, is also good. This is not a James Bond role. He plays a real character with both strengths and weaknesses.

While the plot is arguably complex, it is easy for the viewer to follow. It has some wonderful twists.  All are explained without the viewer having to ask questions of others at the end of the production.

Finally, the settings are also right on the money.  Mainly set in Sweden, the viewer is shown dark landscapes with little colour, These tie in nicely with the overall plot.  Nothing is out of place.

it is a good film.  how much you like it will depend on whether you've seen the swedish film. the swedish film was the novel brought to life.  the american film isn't simply because it is american. however, if you hate subtitles, don't like foreign films much and in general like american remakes of foreign films, then this is the version for you.

here's the plot: a wealthy industrialist wants the murder of Harriet, a young relative missing for decades and presumed dead., finally solved.  he perceives a disgraced journalist as his best bet as a detective.  he makes him an offer too ample to refuse and we are off and running. as our amateur detective keeps digging, it appears that a serial killer is involved. joining him in this investigation is lisabeth salander.  she takes over the movie just as she took over the book and swedish film.  she is a very complex young woman with staggering computer abilities. she also has some staggering problems which begin to unfold. the young woman playing her in the film is outstanding,  i can't decide which actress i like best in her role.  we all know daniel craig is a great actor but he doesn't even come close to what this actress pulls off in this film. she even makes me believe she is swedish, which craig never does.

4226671,3,B003Y5H5HO,"Although David Fincher's English-speaking remake is a superior film as cinema,the original made-for-TV Swedish film was rougher,more ragged,closer to the bone,the characters more threatened. The remake in Sweden stays true to the source,but has the jarring note of all the characters apart from Craig(Blomkvist) speaking with a Swedish accent. Rooney Mara captures a complexity of character-vulnerable,unhinged,sexy, detached,steely and feminine,losing the spikey brittleness and demonic energy of the original. This tale of rape-revenge as well as political thriller exposing Sweden's hidden history of fascism is superbly directed, smoothing out kinks and convolutions in the plot, streamlining the narrative,reducing psychology to data. When Salander, in a scene very late in the film, tells Blomkvist about her early life,it registers neither as a ""revealing moment"" nor as a glimpse into her ""motivation,"" but as another datum. The opening credits a petrol-dripping kaleidoscope of bodies,flowers,keyboards,dragons to Led Zeppelin's `Immigrant Song', mimicing a James Bond opening,with Blomkvist played by the current Bond. But this new man is ultimately saved by Salander,who outclasses and dominates him.

At times the story seems on auto-pilot; the result is slick,funereally chilly:a movie about an investigativeprocess rather than a crime. In the Oplev version(2009),characters are uneasy,less confident, emotions are closer to the surface. Some heartfulness has been flushed out with the bathwater in Fincher's version despite Mara's fresh take on Salander. In Oplev's film we had the original(subtitled) Swedish and it captured the pulpy spirit of the bookbetter. In Fincher's film the cinematography and editing are excellent as are Trent Reznor's and Atticus Ros's score,a tissue of connective membrane for the dramatic information. We also get a superb cast of back-up actors: Plummer, Wright,Skarsgard,Berkoff,James and Richardson. In this film more than the original, the stories of Mikael and Lisbeth are kept separate for an extended period. We learn about the girl's state-appointed guardian (Yorick van Wageningen), who abused her, stole from her and terrorized her. Her attempts to avenge herself would make a movie of their own. When the two meet an hour in we are fully primed up as to their combined motivation,to identify the serial killer,as lovers.

Fincher and his team do a good job of setting out an intriguing story. Fincher has a distinct visual sensibility and a good sense of pacing, and the film derives much of its momentum from Mikael's sleuthing into the lives of the Vangers and Lisbeth's high-tech hacking, which passes the smell test more easily here than it did in Arden Oplev's version. We live vicariously through the two idealised central characters in a wish-fulfilment fantasy disguised as thriller. The irony is that of the two versions I prefer the awkward sincerity of the original. If you see subtitles, never ask for your money back! The original got there first.

Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) is a journalist and magazine co-owner who is disgraced by a dubious unfavourable court ruling, but despite negative headlines he is hired by Henrik Vanger, after a process of meticulous due diligence, to try and solve the disappearance of Henrik's niece Harriet whilst masquerading as writing Vanger memoirs.

Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) is presented as a highly troubled young adult, but is actually a talented investigator with special computer hacking and research skills. Her demeanour is icy cold and at times vicious, yet this is simply a shield of protection from the abuse she has suffered. At first Blomkvist learns of her as a faceless person who hacked into his life at the request of Henrik Vanger's security advisor, yet Salander and Blomkvist come together as research partners. The mystery of Harriet becomes their project and they uncover the shocking truth at the risk of their own safety.

Rooney Mara gives an explosive performance as Lisbeth Salander, and Daniel Craig is warm yet quite steely as Mikael Blomkvist. The entire cast present unique and convincing characters.

The film is at times graphic and contains themes which may dislodge some viewers from their seat, with a sensational narrative that engages the viewer in a search for the truth.

He enlists the help of investigative reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) who thinks he is on to something. He needs an assistant and employs the talents of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) in the title role. Lisabeth is a savvy psychotic bisexual computer hacker/investigator who provides us with a dark bizarre subplot.

During the investigation they uncover hints that point to a serial killer, who kills Jewish women based on quotes from Leviticus. The mystery isn't too hard to figure out with the numerous clues that they give you. The movie is best when Rooney Mara is on the screen.

4226674,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Most folk should be familiar with the story by now: disgraced left-wing journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired by a wealthy industrialist to find out who killed his beloved niece 40 years ago. Blomquist hires as a research assistant the titular character, Lisbeth Salander, and together the two uncover the hideous and frighening truth.

For my money this is a superior version of the rightly celebrated book than the original Swedish cinema version (though I've not seen the extended tv version). David Fincher, the director, places his trademark noirish stamp upon the movie. The result is a dark and exciting film with much to enjoy even for those familiar with the story. But like its fine Swedish predessor it is not an easy watch: as a movie about violence againt women it does not flinch from some harsh depiction of such violence.

The cast is stellar, with Daniel Craig doing his charimatic best as Blomkvist. However at its centre this movie has an electrifying performance from Rooney Mara as Lisbeth, catching every nuance of her complex personality from her prickliness to her vulnerablity and tenderness. Its an amazing piece of acting. One must hope that plans are already afoot to permit her to reprise the role in film versions of the rest of the trilogy.",1326585600,6,1270,4.929906542056075
4226675,4,B003Y5H5HO,"As far as I was concerned, my ticket to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was paid for as soon as the opening credits rolled. After an awkward cold open in which two old men share one line of dialog, Trent Reznor and Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song breaks the quiet mood. While Karen screams about those Scandinavians ""from the land of ice and snow,"" silvery images of breaking faces, bleeding technology, unfurling flowers, fire, and who knows what else rip across the screen.

Based on the first book in the Swedish Stieg Larsson's trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo follows journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) and computer hacker Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara). Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), the former head of the grand Vanger enterprises, lures Blomkvist to a small town on an island in order to solve the mystery of his long lost niece. Because she disappeared during a family reunion, at a time when an accident blocked off access to the island, Vanger is convinced a relative murdered her. Meanwhile, the audience also follows Salander, a punkish young woman who is under the care of the state for violent behavior. We witness her abuse, her ruthless, methodical reaction to said abuse, and her genius with a computer.

The film manages to overcome one of my biggest pet peeves: characters in a foreign country speak English with a foreign accent. (Why bother? They're supposed to be speaking another language anyway. The whole world doesn't revolve around English.) The mostly British and American cast tend to speak with a slight Swedish lilt. Another problem with the movie is a certain violent scene which lingers on the perpetrator's sadism, seemingly in order to justify retaliation.

Reznor and Atticus Ross's ambient soundtrack is sometimes self-conscious, as are the sharp editing and Jeff Cronenweth's striking cinematography. However, this approach works: it infuses the film with suspense, conveys the book's intensity, and turns moments which could have been difficult to translate from the page into resonant scenes.

Steven Zaillian's script has been very well edited, weaving subtle themes about greed, victimization, and xenophobia. In general, the few changes from the book clarify the plot. The screenplay is a surprisingly successful balance of character development, dramatic tension, and satisfying solutions.

Most of the characterizations are intriguing and true to their source. Craig's believable and sympathetic Blomkvist might be an improvement on the original. Mara depicts the wildly popular Salander's mixture of detachment, calculation, viciousness, and vulnerability. Plummer's friendly but cunning Vanger is especially close to Larsson's description. Other Vanger relatives are played by Stellen Skarsgaard (excellent as Henrik's amiable nephew), an appropriately cold Geraldine James, and a sensitive Joely Richardson.

Niels Arden Oplev's 2009 Swedish adaptation of the same novel had the disadvantage of a shorter length (it was cut down from a miniseries) and a smaller budget (I assume). The two stars Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace were fantastic, but the series lacked imagination. Overall Fincher's version better captures the feel of the book, and in some cases even improves upon it. I would love to see the sequels to this beautifully shot, gripping adaptation.",1326326400,5,3351,5.373333333333333

I know they wanted to establish character development for Daniel Craig's character, Mikael, and Lisbeth Salander but it took forever for something interesting to finally happen. The film is told by two story lines at first, then finally meet up at about 90 minutes in. First off, I thought Daniel Craig's storyline was a little boring. He's asked by a man named Henrik to solve the murder of his niece that happened 40 years earlier. (You can have a drinking game when Daniel Craig puts his glasses on and takes them off every time he finds another piece of the puzzle) Then we have Rooney Mara's hot awkward Gothic character, Lisbeth Salander. I loved her storyline and her character. She is the only good thing about this movie. She's a computer hacker that deals with mental issues and rape. Later in the movie, she becomes Mikael's assistant in finding a murderer. I probably wouldn't recommend THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO!!!",1325635200,2,1028,4.716666666666667
4226677,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Wrap a compelling murder mystery inside author Stieg Larsson's critique of the declining European welfare state and what we have is a dark horse for the Best Picture Oscar.
 The acting is superb - Daniel Craig peels off his Bond and is very compelling as a journalist given a lucrative assignment after having made the biggest blunder of his career. Craig's Mikael Blomkvist is perplexed by the recruitment and he drops us deep into that. Is Mikael being set up since we learn that the killer is clever enough to be hiding in plain sight?
 Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara) is a character of quite unusual force. Her quiet efficiency and rootlessness is a full-throated roar about the mixed impact of technology on Western societies. What she suffers at the hands of her social worker is a stark commentary on what government welfarism has degenerated into - a narcotic to the poor, a sop to a mass electorate too lazy to deal with the problems of poverty, a make-work scheme for middle-class bureaucrats. Lisbeth's revenge, tipping us to the libertarian anarchist sentiments that Larsson was increasingly drawn to, is a vision of what we'd like to do to corrupt statists in our heart of hearts.
 Heart is probably too nice a word. There's not much heart in ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" - no happy ending for Mikael and Lisbeth. As a work of art, it's as cold as the snowy Swedish landscape. When the wealthy industrialist Henrik, played ably by Christopher Plummer, is the warmest character then we know we're in ""Sin City."" Along these lines the best clue in finding the killer will be looking for people being helpful. It's this reversal of moral field that makes ""Tattoo"" icy hot.
 Interesting that Lisbeth's last name is very close to the great Rabbi Yisrael Salanter, father of the mussar (ethics) movement. Doubly interesting that things Jewish grow in importance throughout the movie. Whether intended or not, Lisbeth strikes a pose as a Jewish heroine, cooperating with the good goyim (non-Jews) and punishing the bad ones with all sorts of unusual weapons. Her orphan status is a moshul (parable) for the diaspora Jew. Despite all the hard knocks, Lisbeth keeps her royal demeanor. Mara plays this multi-layered ice princess to a Best Actress tee.",1325548800,5,2269,4.870466321243524
4226678,5,B003Y5H5HO,"As someone who has read and loved Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy and watched all the Swedish film adaptations of the novels, I was quite skeptical about the Hollywood treatment of the first book, fearing that it would take too many creative liberties and not stay faithful to the essence of the novel. Well, my fears were thankfully misplaced, as I love this film adaptation, rivaling the original Swedish remake (which I am a fan of).

The casting for the Swedish film adaptation was excellent, and I think the Hollywood remake gets it right too. Daniel Craig plays the role of besieged journalist Mikael Blomqvist, who has just lost a libel suit filed against him by Hans Wennerstrom, a billionaire industrialist. Mikael has to pay a hefty sum of money to Wennerstrom, and to add to his woes, the publication he works for is also in financial trouble. Robin Wright plays his married lover and editor/ owner of the publication. Respite comes in the form of an offer from Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), scion of a wealthy family, and retired CEO of Vanger Corporation. Ensconced on the hauntingly beautiful yet desolate Hevestad (which I believe is fictional), Henrik wants Mikael to investigate what happened to his beloved niece Harriet, who mysteriously disappeared several decades ago. Tempted by hefty financial compensation, Mikael is further lured by the promise of confidential information that Henrik possesses, information that could potentially help Mikael against Wennerstrom. Soon, Mikael finds himself holed up on Hevestad in the dead of winter, investigating a cold case, and facing a cool reception from the other members of the Vanger clan, including Harriet's mother, uncle, etc. though he does get some encouragement from one of Harriet's cousins, Martin (Stellan Skarsgaard), who is now the CEO of the company.

Rooney Mara plays Lisbeth Salander, a 23-year-old ward of the state, who has been deemed asocial and incompetent of making adult decisions. Her state-appointed guardian has recently suffered a severe health setback and is unable to perform his duties, so Lisbeth is assigned to a sadistic lawyer who uses his position of authority to sexually abuse her. Mara is credible in her portrayal of an obviously tormented soul who can hold her own and shows that her frail frame belies a steely determination which is at times tempered by emotional vulnerability as seen in her later interactions with Mikael (Lisbeth ends up assisting Mikael on the case).

The movie is about 2 hours and 40 minutes in length, yet I never felt the story lagged at any point. Each scene is important, and the setting and sense of place is as integral to the film as the acting. The cinematography is breathtaking, especially of Hevestad in the depths of winter - cold, brutal, and unforgiving. The procedural aspect of the story, with Mikael and Lisbeth investigating the case together and alongside each other is well-paced, with suspense being gradually built up until the climax. The use of technology is vital in this film, and viewers get to see Lisbeth flex her investigative muscles as she hacks her way to crucial information.

There are some very graphic scenes in this movie portraying violence in the form of rape, physical assault, and nudity. There are also some graphic images of crime scene photographs.

I read the novel several years ago, and it has been a while since I watched the Swedish adaptation but I loved this latest adaptation, and can't wait to see how the filmmakers adapt the other two stories in the series, and am especially interested in how they show the evolution of Lisbeth Salander's character.",1325548800,6,3648,5.0431177446102815
4226679,4,B003Y5H5HO,"After viewing the fairly well-produced and well-adapted ""Girl"" trilogy of films (based on the Millennium novels by the late Stieg Larrson) by director Niels Arden Oplev, the question, ""Why see yet another version of this same story?"" (even if it is done in English, Hollywood style) may just cross one's mind especially in a diminished economy where frugality renders duplication superfluous.  However close to the perfection of the author's vision Noomi Rapace's performance might have been, Rooney Mara's incarnation of Lisbeth Salander seems more nuanced; she smolders with anger and vengeance like her predecessor, but withdraws in pretty silhouettes with a psychological vulnerability that endows her with even more antisocial magnetism and hints at the underbelly personal history yet to be revealed.

Even though easy-on-the-eyes Daniel Craig, as the intrepid journalist Mikhal Blomkvist, more than adequately portrays the likeable character with a winning, almost unconscious self-consciousness, he conciliatorily fades into the background when Mara is on the screen.  As in the novel, Salander's edgy efficiency and genius works well against a backdrop of a seemingly well-oiled society equipped with high-speed trains and technology yet rotting from within with a moral corruptness that suggests repressed aggression.  Mara's face mirrors both Lisbeth's fierce rebellion and the forever scars she wears like a tattoo of resistant resilience.

Director David Fincher deviates a bit from the gospel of the Larsson text--his Lisbeth admits her past openly to Blomkvist in a TMI scene that isn't true to the sensibility of the written character.  Perhaps, Fincher, worried about the reception of this English version and concerned about executing its sequels, reveals too much to accentuate Lisbeth's misplaced sense of betrayal regarding Blomkvist's limited yet open promiscuity. Perhaps, his perception of her desire to please Blomkvist with her openness and her body even after brutal sexual subjugation underlines her role as woman and her place despite her genius and injured sensibility. This is, after all, a novel, that in Europe tellingly goes by the Swedish title ""M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor"" which translates into English as ""Men who hate women.""  The novel's section headings are marked with statistics regarding the percentages of women brutalized by men which, along with key instances in the plotline describing women reduced to victim status due to the sadistic and masochistic actions of their supposed caretakers or loved ones, suggest that even with the seemingly blas&eacute; attitude regarding casual sexual relationships and equality amongst the sexes, there is indeed some disturbing issue that in this culture cannot be rectified by the actions of government or authority but by taking the matter into one's own very capable vigilante hands.

In addition, rather than have the duo work together as in the novel to eventually reveal the initiator of a forty-year-old crime, Fincher chooses to film parallel sequences of enlightenment set to the fast-paced sound of European motorcycles and the edgy organic music of the Oscar-winning team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.  This works to cut the overall time of what could have easily been a three-hour police procedural instead of a fascinating character study of an societal outcast and her soon-to-be crusading knight errant.

Fincher misses a key flashback scene opportunity where Lisbeth stands and watches the killer die as his car bursts into flames.  Why not have his protagonist shudder with that remembrance from her own past and give the audience the thrill of mutual understanding?  For those non-novel readers, why not an anticipatory frisson of what is to come in the next two installments?  Maybe Fincher thought this would be a TMI moment.

Bottom line?  Director David Fincher (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Social-Network/dp/B004HWT6DO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Social Network</a>) compacts Stieg Larsson's rambling novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Girl-with-the-Dragon-Tattoo-Millennium-Trilogy/dp/B0015DROBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy)</a>&nbsp;into two hours and 38 minutes of intense film introducing to a mainstream English speaking audience the edgy pathology and survival of Dragon Girl--social misfit, rebel and genius, Lisbeth Salander.

4226680,3,B003Y5H5HO,"The 2011 version of GWDT has more gloss and a better opening credit sequence, but aside from that, the 2009 version has better pacing, better scripting, and better casting. Take the central character, Lisbeth Salander, played by Rapace (2009) and Mara (2011)-Rapace nailed the character while Mara is only good. This is not meant to take away from Mara's acting-rather an indication that the script and directing in the 2009 version were better at bringing out the character of Lisbeth. Same could be said for the other characters-the scripting in the 2011 version just didn't develop the characters as well as the original version. Also Fincher made some changes that I don't think work as well-in the 2009 version, Mikael and Lisbeth investigate the old crime scenes together while in the 2011 version, Lisbeth investigates them by herself. Mikael is a noted investigative journalist; I could easily picture the police opening up their old case files to him, but not to a weird-looking Goth girl showing up and asking to see the files.

4226681,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I heart Lisbeth Salander!

Take this from someone who never read Stieg Larsson's books or saw the original Swedish version of this movie: Dragon Tattoo rocks!

The film is basically a murder mystery. Forty years ago, in 1966, a 16-year-old girl disappeared without a trace from a large, wealthy Swedish family. A recently-disgraced journalist (Daniel Craig) is approached by the girl's uncle (Christopher Plummer) to look into the case. The case is complex because though the girl's relatives all live on a small island, some are reclusive ex-Nazis and the rest are not talking to each other. Meanwhile, back in the city, Lisbeth Salander -- a young  punk girl, tattooed and pierced -- is undergoing her own difficulties with the social welfare system. She is anti-social, lesbian and tough, but a heck of a hacker and researcher. The movie takes off when she (played by an Oscar-worthy Rooney Mara) and Craig team up to crack the case.

The film is dark, edgy and very rough. Shot in monochromes, it exudes a sense of cold and isolation that matches the spirit of its characters. The plot contains very frank depictions of sexual abuse and rape, and the dialog is rough as well. This makes the characters, especially Lisbeth's, very real and multi-faceted. Lisbeth is one of the darkest heroines to emerge from a fiction writer's pen. She is small and fragile, with nearly translucent skin and an air of fatalism. Yet she is strong and resourceful, capable of outwitting her victimizers with a (perhaps) put-on madness that nears psychotic levels. Not a young lady to be tampered with.

Great film, even if the Plummers and Craigs can't match Mara's soul-seared intensity.",1325376000,5,1673,4.960714285714285
4226682,4,B003Y5H5HO,"Others have made the comment already but it cannot be emphasized enough: what is the point of remaking a beautiful original so shortly after the release of that original? Comparisons with Let the Right One in/Let Me In come to mind right away: the Swedish original was truly an immediate classic, and the bigest clompliment I can make for the Hollywood remake is that it simply didn't screw it up (as it could have, and in many cases does). I am a big fan of the original Swedish trilogy Millenium movies. I was 'comforted' that David Fincher would be directing the remake, and with time on my hands while on vacation, I went to see this yesterday.

""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" (160 min.) is a remake that is well done, period. That said, it really doesn't add much to the original Swedish version. As hard as Rooney Mara tries, for me she does not equal, let alone outshine, the performance brought by Noomi Rapace who will also be the true Liesbet. Perhaps the biggest surprise for me in the remake is the outstanding musical score from Trent Reznor (NIN frontman), who also did the score for last year's The Social Network (for which he won an Oscar I believe). Reznor has certainly found a second calling with these movie scores. The cover of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song by Reznor and guest vocalist Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeas) is outstanding.

In all, if you haven't seen the original Swedish movie, by all means check out the remake, and you will not be disappointed as this is still a very good movie. If you have seen the original Swedish movie, I am not sure what the point of the remake is. The best I can say is that the Hollywood remake didn't screw it up.",1325203200,2,1676,4.473856209150327

There is much to recommend each. There are choices in each film that I prefer over the other.

David Fincher's American film is more slickly and confidently made but, perhaps because the story was familiar already, had less of an emotional impact that the rougher and rawer Swedish film. The American version of the investigation seemed too easy and, as good an actor as he is, Daniel Craig just carries too great an aura of physical competence to convincingly portray Mikael Blomkvist.

Rooney Mara's Lisbeth Salander is distinct from but just as good as Noomi Rapace's. We experience less of Lisbeth Salander's world in the American film, mostly to the detriment of my investment in her story, but Fincher and Co. do leave out some information which was shoehorned into the Swedish film from later books in the series which was probably better left for later. Good call on that.

4226684,5,B003Y5H5HO,"Only rarely does a movie based upon a novel capture the essence of the original, but with GWTDT, it's now been accomplished twice over.  If you've seen the  excellent Swedish version that was released a couple of years ago, you've got to wonder why anyone would feel the need to do it again. Nevertheless,  screenwriter Steven Zaillian and director David Fincher did just that, and though theirs is not quite so menacing, it's exciting, compelling, and very well made.  Daniel Craig turns in a solid performance as disgraced journalist Mikael Blomqvist, although it seems he's been typecast, much as was Clint Eastwood in earlier days. Christopher Plummer is terrific in the role of  aging industrialist Henrik Vanger, who hires Blomqvist to find out who murdered his young niece decades ago. The real star of this show, however, is Rooney Mara, the virtual unknown who landed this plum of a role, the unconventional, psychologically damaged, yet powerful Lisbeth Salander.

This is a dark, brooding film, with two themes, that of the murder mystery, and that of  Lisbeth's unrelentingly painful young life. Brilliant but almost psychotically defensive, she's managed to retain her capacity for empathy. While she goes way overboard when compelled to bring about justice, she's the type of heroine that you can't help but root for. It's interesting to see Lisbeth's humanity begin to emerge as she and Blomqkvist begin to develop a relationship; too bad it takes about half the movie to get to their initial meeting. Though critics have written that the Zaillian version has been toned down for American audiences, its brutal violence and depravity are still difficult to watch. On the other hand, Sweden's wintery scenery provides the perfect backdrop for such a story.

Let's hope it's not too long until the sequel, The Girl Who Played With Fire, hits the theaters.",1325116800,4,1868,5.0816993464052285
4226685,5,B003Y5H5HO,"When I first heard that there was to be an American production of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" I had some qualms. Not uncommonly, an American version of some movie can be so commercialized that the heart of the original movie disappears. Such is most definitely NOT the case today.

If one has seen the Swedish version, it is impossible not to compare them and make some judgments. Noomi Rapace was terrific as Lisbeth Salander, the quirky, antisocial genius, filled with all manner of skills that would not be expected from her prickly exterior. Needless to say, I wondered how Rooney Mara would handle this character, one of the more interesting literary figures in recent years. Not to worry. Her take on Salander is different from Rapace, but it works very well. And this is critical. The movie revolves around Salander and her peculiar character. If this character doesn't work, the movie would fail. Mara provides a sense of Lisbeth's distance from others, her inherent suspiciousness, her victimization and how she can respond to that with violence, her unique skills. . . . And also her humanity, as she interacts with her former overseer, felled by a stroke.

Daniel Craig plays Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced investigative reporter. He does a good turn as this character, although I mildly prefer the Swedish variant on Blomkvist (Michael Nyqvist). Craig, however, does nicely in this role.

The other characters also work well on screen in this version.

The plot is simple: Blomkvist is disgraced when a story he writes on a gazillionaire rogue financier turns out to be false (he was set up). He ends up agreeing to work for retired industrialist Henrik Vanger, still obsessed with the apparent murder of Harriet Vanger when she was just a teenager, many decades earlier. Salander is the investigator vetting Blomkvist for Vanger.

Blomkvist accepts the job, finally. Halfway through the movie, he meets Salander. And, in many ways, this is when the movie hits its stride. Their relationship develops in unexpected ways. They work toward solving a string of murders apparently related to Harriet.

The mystery as to the murderer--and the revelation of the fate of Harriet--are addressed nicely.

This version follows the book more closely than the Swedish version. Salander's stealth attack on the rogue financier is played out nicely (it is only hinted at in the earlier version). The ending is most poignant, and much closer to the book than the Swedish version. Director Peter Fincher's vision works well. The cinematography is better than the Swedish version (although making that statement is almost like comparing apples and oranges, since the productions are different).

In the end, I like both versions. But this version holds up quite nicely, and my original suspicions about a commercial sellout were allayed.",1325030400,8,2838,5.088172043010752

It is a tense and terrifying voyage into human darkness that may stay with the viewer for awhile.

The premise of the movie is a cold case murder, resurrected by a dying man, who hires the skills of a disgraced investigative journalist.  ""Tattoo"" features superb location shooting in Stockholm and on a lovely but rather bleak Swedish island.  Daniel Craig is entirely believable as journalist Mikael Blomkvist, a man looking to revive his reputation, who stumbles into an engrossing mystery.  Christopher Plummer is a dying industrialist, seeking the truth of the fate of a long-missing niece.  Skellan Skarsgard is a positive chameleon as the industrialist's nephew, who encourages the investigation.  The real star of the movie, however, is Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo, a highly skilled computer hacker with a twisted, abusive background.

This is a long movie at 158 minutes, but the pacing and dialogue are such that most viewers will be thoroughly draw into the story.  Blomkvist and Salander will arrive at the island and the investigation by separate paths, to make a surprisingly effective team.  They will follow a thin trail of 40 year-old clues to a savage and surprising serial killer.  The solution to the mystery of the missing girl is formed of a terrifying, and haunting, multiple ending.

""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is very highly recommended, but only to adults who can tolerate the disturbing abuse that forms Lisbeth's character at the beginning of the movie.",1324944000,,1749,5.055749128919861
4226709,5,B003Y5H5HO,"I have seen the Swedish films, yet not read the books. The US version is not a remake of the Swedish version; it is simply another adaptation of the novel. I must say I was very impressed with the pacing and over-all style and raw feeling of the US version of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. The story, whether from the books, Swedish version or US version is quite a dark and winding journey. If you have not read the books or watched the Swedish versions I recommend now starting with the US version of the film. This US version will be the first of the trilogy; The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who played with Fire, and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.

The opening credit sequence, as I'm sure many of you have heard is quite amazing. I loved it and all the work they put into it. It was very Bond like yet encompassed the dark complexities of this story and the film. This film is much more speedy than the Swedish versions. I found the Swedish films to be a little slow at times, which yes builds tension however the pacing of the US version is much more my speed. Very fast and smart.

It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.

When it comes to the characters, I found that Rooney Mara played a much better Lisbeth than Noomi Rapace. And the interactions with Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) were great and at times quite funny. The two of them working together when they seem to be opposites was very entertaining and Daniel and Rooney pulled it off perfectly. As a huge fan of the new Bond reboots I have grown to love Daniel Craig and enjoy seeing him on the screen. He is a very talented actor and seems to give the audience what they want. Stellan Skarsgrd, Christopher Plummer and Robin Wright also did a great job, as well as the other cast members. Each character was very carefully cast and bond perfectly to the heart of this film.

The story, the acting, the directing; everything was perfect and I must say that director David Fincher is at the top of his game. For those who do not know, he directed Fight Club, Se7en, The Game, Zodiac, The Social Network, Alien 3, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Panic Room. The music, the ambiance, and the over-all dark feel to the film was so well done I couldn't believe it. I could not have asked for a better-crafted film. I am quite anxious to see the rest of the trilogy.",1324944000,5,2823,4.320754716981132
4226710,2,B003Y5H5HO,"Geeze.  This review is based solely on the movie.  I did not see the apparent prior version or read the books, but I did not expect this.  Sex -- no problem.  But, explicit sodomy/rape, forced oral sex, torture, animal decapitation, photos of murdered and tortured women and lesbian sex -- I could have done without.  The screams in the sodomy/rape scene were heart-breaking and sickening -- certainly not ""entertainment"" by the wildest stretch of the word.  I personally do not understand why there were so many positive reviews on this film.

My son and I both enjoy Daniel Craig as an actor, and thought the promo looked good. I was surprised he accepted this role.  The movie was 2 hours long or more.  The first 3/4 was very slow.  The last 1/4 was fast-moving and interesting, and saved the film from death.

The movie begins with a winter scene in Sweden.  Mikhail (Daniel Craig) loses his savings in a court battle over ""inaccurate reporting"" as a magazine journalist.  He reported a story without being able to prove it.  Meanwhile, a separate side story gets our attention about an unconventional young girl trying to survive.  She is living off a trust fund and is an exceptional part-time independent investigator. Watching the two stories side-by-side for some time, you wonder how they will eventually come together.  Although Rooney Mara gives an outstanding performance as Lisbeth Salander, the troubled young girl, in my opinion, her abilities are wasted in the violent storyline of this movie.

Veteran actor Christopher Plummer requests Craig come to his mansion on the Island in or around Hedestad, where he offers Craig a nice sum to write his memoirs.  (According to the internet, Hedestad is a ficticious place, but if you happen to be traveling to Stockholm, the Stockholm City Museum is currently offering a guided tour that visits real locations that the book mentions.) What Plummer is really asking is for Craig to investigate the murder of 16-year old family-member Harriet, killed many years ago.  Her body was never found.  The Island is all owned by members of the same family, many of which who do not speak to each other.  Craig moves into the guest house on the property and begins to investigate.

With the price of movies today, don't waste your money on this flick.  I see that some folks think it was brilliant.  Needless to say, I did not like the overall movie and I offer you my humble opinion as well, and why, so that you can make an educated choice of whether or not you want to see it.  If they had left out the behaviors mentioned above, I would have still only rated it an overall 3 because it was interesting but much of it was very slow.  No, I will not watch it again and I will not buy the video.  I hope you do not take your young children with you if you choose to go to see this movie.",1324857600,12,2840,4.628
4226711,5,B003Y5H5HO,"""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Mikael Blomkvist is a financial reporter determined to restore his honor after being convicted of libel. Engaged by one of Sweden's wealthiest industrialists, Henrik Vanger, to get to the bottom of the long-ago disappearance of his beloved niece, Harriet -- murdered, Vanger believes, by a member of his large family -- the journalist heads to a remote island on the frozen Swedish coast, unaware of what awaits him. At the same time, Lisbeth Salander, an unusual but ingenious investigator with Milton Security, is hired to do a background check on Blomkvist, a job that ultimately leads to her joining Mikael in his investigation of who killed Harriet Vanger. Though Lisbeth shields herself from a world that has repeatedly betrayed her, her hacking skills and single-minded focus become invaluable. While Mikael goes face-to-face with the tight-lipped Vangers, Lisbeth plies the wired shadows. They begin to trace a chain of homicides from the past into the present, forging a fragile strand of trust even as they are pulled into the most savage currents of modern crime.

The cast led by Daniel Craig (as Mikael Blomkvist) & Rooney Mara (terrific as Lisbeth Salander) is excellent. The directing by David Fincher is excellent. The screenplay (based on Stieg Larsson's novel) by Steven Zaillian (also executive produced) is excellent.

The music by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is excellent. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is excellent. The film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall is excellent. The casting by Laray Mayfield is excellent. The production design by Donald Graham Burt is excellent. The art direction by Frida Arvidsson, Linda Janson, Pernilla Olsson, Tom Reta, Kajsa Severin & Mikael Varhelyi is excellent. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is excellent. The costume design by Trish Summerville is excellent.

This is an excellent and well-crafted film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with your mind thinking and your heart racing. It is also a well-paced and well-made film that is faithful, not only to the novel, but the original Swedish language film, which this is a terrific companion to. Rooney Mara gives a terrific, career-making performance as Lisbeth and she and Daniel Craig have a great chemistry together. This is one of the best films of the winter-holiday season and of the year.",1324771200,4,2401,5.088832487309645
4226712,5,B003Y5H5HO,"When I first heard that there was to be an American re-make of the mega-popular Swedish ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" films, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthused. I thought that the Swedish version that was released here in the States, with subtitles, did the job well enough. Having read all three books, I felt like I knew the trilogy very well, because these books had become a part of my life. They were my ""Twilight"", my ""Harry Potter"". These books were a part of me for roughly four years, and I didn't want to see my babies be massacred by American filmmakers who were only out for the money, uninterested in satisfying die-hard fans of the novels.

I forgot about this movie, until I saw the first trailer, which featured images from the film that I feared would be taken out of the film, set to a kick-ass cover of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"", by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed by Trent Reznor, of Nine Inch Nails, who I realized was tapped to write and compose the film's score. That trailer should be remarked as one of the best that Hollywood has done in years, because it was well-done enough to turn skeptics like myself.

The other night, I saw David Fincher's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"". Having read the book, and having seen the original Swedish film, this is my third time seeing this story. The book, and the original film were superbly done, in my opinion. I had a hard time believing that this version could be better. It was. It's extremely faithful to the novel. There are little scenes and details from the novel that I assumed would be cut from the film, that weren't. The changes from the novel were refreshingly minuscule, but what was changed felt right, and didn't feel like a blasphemy to those, like myself, who swear by these books.

The story follows Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a Swedish journalist recently desecrated by a wrongful libel conviction, who is asked by a dying man to help him find out how his niece, Harriet was murdered 36 years ago. He is asked to break down the events of one day, where she went missing. He enlists the help of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a troubled genius/computer hacker/research assistant who has led a very hard life. These two come together to solve what really happened on that day, but the central mystery is only one third of the story. Salander and Blomkvist both have their own stories going on, which are both quite interesting, made more interesting when they intertwine with each other. I'm deciding not to talk about those stories in this review, for a reason. You'll understand when you see the film.

A big part of why this movie works is Rooney Mara. She rocks. She transformed herself into the incredibly hard to grasp, and incredibly elusive Lisbeth Salander. She does what any other better-known actress could not have done, because they would have been too recognizable. I have seen Mara in a few films prior to this, including Fincher's ""The Social Network"" and the god-awful remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", and I didn't recognize the Mara from those movies at all in this performance, because she was Salander, and not herself, at all. She had clearly devoured the books, and analyzed them as heavily as any fan would have. As a fan of this saga, I have to mention Noomi Rapace, in this review, who played Salander in the Swedish films. She, in my first viewing of the Swedish film, did a good job. But when compared to Mara, she fails incredibly. Rapace was one, too old to conceivably play the part, and two, was very much one-dimensional while Mara makes Salander exactly what I wanted her to be. I hate resorting to trite terminology like ""amazing"" and ""incredible"", but both of those overused words describe Rooney Mara's performance perfectly.

I hate to say this, but, with Mara stealing every scene she is in, Daniel Craig becomes something of an afterthought in this film. However, if I sit down and think about it, he was the perfect choice to play this role. He was a better choice than Michael Nyqvist, who annoyed me after a short while (in the Swedish films). He brings what the role needs - a character who seems to be holding it together on the outside, while visibly falling apart on the inside, given all that has happened to him. He was the perfect choice for this thing, which I hope will be an American film trilogy, as well as the Swedish one.

""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", in a cinematic sense, is in many ways, is a mood piece, like ""Lost in Translation"" or anything written by Nicole Holofcener. It is very focused on imagery, setting and, of course, mood, yet it has a very fast-moving script which doesn't waste a second of its 160 minute running time. Every minute is exciting, and even thrilling. I'm pleased that this film decidedly stuck so close to the book, but changed small things that worked in its advantage, just like ""The Help"" did earlier this year. One thing that is important to realize about this film is that it isn't a re-make of the original Swedish film, like many will assume it is. It's AN ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL. Many American audiences did not see the original Swedish films, and this is a great way to expose them to a fantastic and very cinematic novel, which is basically being played out, page for page on the big screen.

My big fear about this movie was not that it wouldn't be as good as the book, or the original film version, because I didn't expect it to be nearly as good as it was, yet I was worried that it would turn out like ""The Da Vinci Code""; a very popular novel that was made into a film that was incomprehensible to anyone who didn't read the book. This is a tremendously accessible film. While the cast all use thick Swedish accents, and the culture is noticeably different than what Americans are used to, there is nothing lost in translation. Friends of mine who I saw the film with, who hadn't read the book were engrossed in it, simply because it was a well done movie in every aspect possible.

A big part of why this movie works is David Fincher. He did a fabulous job. He would be the only person suitable to do the film's future installments. He and Steven Zaillian, who wrote the brilliant screenplay made sure that the film would be technically brilliant, if everything else were to fall apart. I have to mention Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and Atticus Ross, who are responsible for the cold, emotionally distant, and yet incredibly intense score. Those two worked with Fincher on ""The Social Network"", and that film worked incredibly well, too, so it only makes sense that the group would be reunited for this film. The extravagant and (for lack of a better term) awesome credit sequence followed to Karen O's cover of ""Immigrant Song"" was just that...awesome. I don't want to describe it very heavily, but it's an experience in and of itself.

It should be mentioned that this film is delightfully not for the faint of heart, featuring graphic violence and sexuality that will potentially scar young children for life. It's not going to be something that everyone will love, however it got a big applause in the theatre I saw it in. I look forward to seeing this film multiple times, and before I let this review get too long, let me just say that this is one of those ""if you only see one movie this year..."" kind of movies. Gripping, thrilling and brilliant. Missing it would be a crime.

4226713,3,B003Y5H5HO,"You KNEW I'd be a hard sell on this American retread, but the word ""gratuitous"" quickly came to mind. I'll be the first to acknowledge that David Fincher (""Zodiac"") is a brilliant director, but when a book and original movie are already universally known and effectively done, why pad a perfectly adequate story with blatant foreshadowing, gratuitous characters and unnecessary violence? This thing runs for 158 minutes and inserts new scenes that are not consistent with Stieg Larsson's originals!

My defense shields came up during the over-wrought title sequence, but they came down a bit when the film actually began because I AM fond of the story. It has interesting characters, plenty of action, and a plot that is just complicated enough to keep us engaged. After all, how many stories involve a 40-year-old murder?

Let's start with the cast:

  * Daniel Craig (""Defiance""), it took courage to accept a role when the standard has already been set by Michael Nyqvist. Craig's work already stands alone: He is a terrific James Bond and has enjoyed wide-ranging roles over an impressive number of years. Here, his journalist, Mikael Blomkvist is hired by an industrialist to investigate the death/disappearance of his beloved niece 40 years ago. We love Craig, so we won't hold this against him.
  * Rooney Mara (""The Social Network"") was determined to make this work. She got piercings, worked out and shaved off her eyebrows. THAT should prove her dedication to her art! Taking over the iconic role of social misfit Liz Salander from Noomie Rapace took guts, and it's clear that she did exactly as Fincher directed her to do. ...sigh....
  * Christopher Plummer (""Beginners"") has the aristocratic panache necessary to portray an elderly industrialist. His wry descriptions of his relatives bring humor to a pretty desolate picture of the dysfunctional Vanger family.
  * Stellan Skarsgrd (""Thor"") is a prominent member of that dysfunctional family....
  * Robin Wright (""The Conspirator"") is perfect as Erika Berger, Mikael's long-time (married) lover and co-publisher of their Millennium magazine.

It's a sad commentary that this movie is even necessary. Are Americans so illiterate that we can't even manage to read captions? Are we so jaded that we must have an already action-filled story ramped up to this degree? With an R rating, expect nudity, rape, violence, and blowie uppie stuff.

Now let me try to be fair: I'm going to guess that ""...Tattoo"" virgins, who haven't a clue what to expect, will be thrilled and surprised. They will never guess that a much better version exists. I guess that's why this was made in the first place, huh? Well, who am I to say....? I will pre-order this DVD as soon as it is available on Amazon.com because my DVD library contains many such comparisons and remakes. I'm sad, though...",1324684800,8,2834,5.0256410256410255
4226714,4,B003Y5H5HO,"A man who works as a journalist is asked to investigate the disappearance of a woman in the 60's. He teams with Lisbeth Salander, a woman who, let's just say, is very unique. She is a computer hacker who early on in the film takes revenge on a man who brutally rapes her. The two are working together to solve the mystery of Harriet, who mysteriously vanished years ago. The film is technically outstanding, well-acted, and it maintains the realism and brutality of the rape and revenge scenes involving Lisbeth Salander. Unfortunately, the movie is overlong due to an unnecessary revenge sequence involving a businessman that the journalist had been convicted of libeling. With David Fincher at the helm, I expected a great film, but what I saw was merely a good one.",1324684800,3,768,4.7819548872180455
4226715,1,B003Y5H5HO,"""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is a series of scenes of sadomasochistic torture. The most graphic scene depicts a large adult male violating a female who has the body of a pubescent girl. There are other, less graphic scenes where males are subject to sadomasochistic torture. There is a series of still photographs of women who have been subjected to sadomasochistic torture. Audience members who are attracted to that activity, or fantasies of it, will very much want to see this film. They will be rewarded by it. The film will inspire some to pursue the opportunity to violate women and girls. The filmmakers will profit from others' pain.

A flimsy, utterly vanilla murder plot - a plot out of a C-grade episode of ""Columbo"" - is the excuse for the exploitation scenes. A girl named Harriet disappeared forty years ago from a rich family's private island in Sweden. If you're at all curious as to what happened to Harriet, do yourself a favor and perform a google search of the film's title plus the word ""spoiler."" You'll soon discover how vapid the plot is.

The biggest mystery of the film is why all these people ostensibly living in Sweden speak English with variations on Scandinavian accents, accents that roll around unevenly between Helsinki and Vienna. Robin Wright's accent is best. Christopher Plummer's is worst. Daniel Craig doesn't even try (memories of his uneven Polish accent in ""Defiance."")

Harriet is being pursued by Daniel Craig, a reporter, and Lisbeth, the eponymous heroine. Lisbeth is strictly a male fantasy who could never exist in real life. She is less real than the blow-up doll Ryan Gosling fell in love with in ""Lars and the Real Girl."" Lisbeth has superhero powers on a computer, with weapons, on a motorcycle, and in international finance, but she is helpless when men attempt to assault her. Make the woman powerful and then violate and humiliate her: a classic motif of misogynist porn. Lisbeth has the body of a pubescent girl, and you get to see every inch of it. For the gentlemen's club crowd, Lisbeth does girl-on-girl action, but, in the end, her job is to make the male lead, and viewer, happy.

As part of the film's pretentious overlay, there are lots of interior shots of Swedish furniture and exterior shots of snow. Chair. Snow. Wind. Torture. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.

The film is boring. The attempts to create tension are pathetic and hackneyed. A character is alone in an archive at night. Suddenly a door is heard closing. OOOO boogedy boogedy! I'm really scared now! Evidence is pieced together and suddenly one realizes who the villain is. And the villain is creeping up upon the hero even at that very moment! Be still my heart. A killer talks for a really long time before dispatching the victim, thus potentially giving a rescuer a chance to arrive. Wow, I've never seen THAT done before!

There is a completely pointless series of scenes tacked on at the end relating to high finance. So much for narrative tension and drive. Trent Reznor's score is endlessly irritating in its neediness: ""Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm doing something really edgy here!"" I kept thinking of Bernard Herrmann's amazing shower scene music from ""Psycho,"" music that seemed to just be the natural sound that scene would make, music that was a seamless part of the terror. No such moments in ""Tattoo.""

What else. Rich people are bad. Nazis are really, really bad. Rich Nazis are really, really, really bad. Fat people are worst of all. The Bible causes people to become serial killers who hate women. Interestingly, boring, pretentious torture porn, apparently, does not cause people to become serial killers who hate women. Every other Swedish home has an extensively equipped torture chamber - you missed that at IKEA, didn't you? Well, the stores ARE really big. Torture is such a popular national pastime in Sweden that you have to wonder how they make time to prepare their famous meatballs, never mind Volvos. Tourists traveling to Sweden must learn to say, ""Don't tase me, Bro,"" in Swedish, and should never, ever drop the soap.",1324684800,39,4097,4.844285714285714
