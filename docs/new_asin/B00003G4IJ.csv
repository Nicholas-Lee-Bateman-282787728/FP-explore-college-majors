7918623,5,B00003G4IJ,"There is Art and there is non-Art, and it seems: very few people are able to tell the one from the other! This film falls under the former. In Benoit Jacquot's ""La dsenchante"" (""The Disenchanted"" from 1990), we get a totally surreal-symbolist work that, the majority of its viewers are not able to grasp or discern (an assurance of its artistic value). The film is basically conveying Rimbaud's poetic and philosophic message via a story (that is essentially irrelevant and just a device), that in principle is also a reflection of the human condition. Pure (because even physical entanglements cannot blemish her ""spirit"") and beautiful 'Beth' (Judith  Godrche), is nothing but a representation of Art/the Natural World if you will, in all its Mystery. The blue-eyed 'l'autre' (Malcolm Conrath) was most likely---Rimbaud himself. The 'Chinese-boy'---Rimbaud's trip to Java, etc., etc. All cleverly and subtly done in this truly ""nouvelle vague"" master-work that, ranks right-up there with its 60's counterparts. There were shots of the strikingly beautiful 'Beth' that were framed and composed in the best tableaux-like quality that, were revelations of pure magic. The longing for something more (to life and its meaning/purpose), was very much a part of Rimbaud's and other similarly qualified poets ""raison d'tre"". Benoit Jacquot makes very good use of the film's length, so it doesn't become tedious or redundant, but flows like a poem should. Not to be missed; a truly worthy addition in every cinephile's collection. The DVD picture and sound quality by First Run Features is very good. NTSC, French (English subtitles), NR 78 mins. (BTW: this interpretation is my own, and there's certainly more than one.)

7918624,2,B00003G4IJ,"There's a quick full frontal of the teen girl, but that's about as erotic as this 1988 French film gets. It's a coming of age tale, but we never really care about any of the characters because the script is so solemn and dull. Drones on for almost 2 hours, as well. Not great.",1341446400,2,276,4.12962962962963
7918625,5,B00003G4IJ,"17 year old Parisian, Beth, lives in poverty with her sick mother and little brother. When Beth's good looking boyfriend suggests she get some experience and sleep with someone ugly-the uglier the better-Beth comes to the realization that her life is probably going to be one of continual disenchantment. She seeks solace in a man who might be like her idealized Rimbaud-a heart broken writer living in a sparse apartment-to no avail. She dumps her indifferent boyfriend who has now become incensed that his sexual object has spurned him. At her mother's insistence,""I've done worse things for you"", Beth sleeps with Sugardad, a 65 year old ""doctor"" and her mother's lover-for the money to leave her existence behind. As her mother prosaicilly puts it before Beth leaves the apartment to go to the doctor's house, ""You're no longer a child"". One doubts Beth ever was.

Typical of French films, the story arc here is not strong and the references are subtle, so know what you are getting. This is not a loud American film. As Beth enters Sugardads apartment, she goes into his examination room and adjusts the examination table to prone position to suggest the sexual encounter that is about to happen. And though everyone says Beth is no longer a child, we watch as Beth dances on the carpet while waiting for Sugardad to answer a call, placing her feet toe to heel as if balancing on a curb she's trying not to fall off of. Sugardad's examination room is covered in cobwebs, but his phone is ringing off the hook-an allusion to the fact that her mother is a morphine addict and Sugardad her dealer.

The acting here is wonderful and the story charming. I enjoyed this film, but it isn't uplifting. However, it is a lighter and more beautiful version of the completely gutting ""Lilya 4-Ever"".",1214524800,7,1792,4.77741935483871
7918626,1,B00003G4IJ,"This move was a complete waste of time and money!

Talk about a build up to a let down ending... This movie is not erotic.  In fact, it's not even entertaining.  I thought the French were better at making this kind of movie... I guess not though.",1153958400,3,246,4.191489361702128

7918628,4,B00003G4IJ,"This is a charming little film made in the agreeable French tradition of  Vadim, Techine, Kieslowski, et al, in which the film itself reflects the director's adoration for its pretty young star.  In this case we have  Director Benot Jacquot adoring Judith Godr&egrave;che, who plays a poor but  principled 17-year-old Parisian girl disenchanted with her life, in  particular with the choices she has in males.  Her boyfriend tells her she  should sleep with somebody ugly.  Just why isn't clear.  He is referred to  as ""whatshisname.""  She meets an interesting man, Alphonse, played by  Marchel Bozonnet, but he is too old for her and, at any rate, still  enamored of another.  And certainly she doesn't want her mother's lover,  referred to as ""Sugardad,"" who is in his sixties.

Godr&egrave;che herself is as  natural and unself-conscience as a child.  Dressed mostly in thin house  dresses that cling lightly to her body, she displays the clear eyes, the  clean jaw line and sculptured arms of youthful innocence.  The camera  adores her face and stays with her throughout.  Clearly she is good and  good to look at, but I would not say she is as enchanting as Krzysztof  Kieslowski's Ir&egrave;ne Jacob (La Double vie de V&eacute;ronique (1991); Trois  Couleurs: Rouge (1994)) nor as talented as Juliette Binoche in Andre  Techine's Rendez-Vous (1985).  And of course not nearly as sexy as Brigitte  Bardot in Roger Vadim's And God Created Woman (1957).

But comparisons are  odious.  This is a good film in its own right.  The treatment suggests a  short story from a literary journal, original, with quiet, unexpected  tableaux of daily life leaving one to ponder.  The climax appears without  one's knowing it until the film begins the closing credits and then one  understands what happened.  There is a dark symbolic element throughout  suggesting the bondage to the material world that comes when a girl is no  longer a child.

Vietnamese-French actor Hai Truhong Tu is excellent in a  small part as Godr&egrave;che's Chinese friend.
