5131059,5,B0084I7QMA,"I studied Gary Snyder in 1973 as an English major at UCLA in a special seminar focusing on ""modern American poets.""  Since then I""ve done my best to stay up on his latest works.  This DVD is a great way to encapsulate his thinking and practices of the Wild.

I now live in Los Osos on the central California coast and was disappointed not to have the chance to catch up with Gary in person during the filming of this DVD; but I can understand the need for some isolation
.
First time I saw him was in 1974 at a poetry reading at UCSB's Campbell Hall where a rally led by students and faculty had been organized to fight the administration's decision not to renew Kenneth Rexroth's faculty position. Gary was there along with Allen Ginsberg who had a broken leg in a full cast. I'll never forget the sight of seeing Allen in his bib overalls with the seam ripped out in order to accomodate the huge cast.

The last time I saw Gary was at Allen's 64th Birthday celebration in 1990 in San Francisco (yes, we all sang ""When I'm 64!). His party doubled as a benefit to save the last living coral reef in Japan at Shiraho, Okinawa.  The MC was Peter Coyote and the poets besides Gary and Allen included Michael McClure, Nanao Sakaki and Joanne Kyger.  The title of the benefit was the ""Eco-Poetry-Round Up.""  I wish that was recorded somewhere.

Namaste,

5131060,5,B0084I7QMA,"A classic.  Gary Snyder takes center stage, with Jim Harrison supporting, and that seems to work.  They are both super amazing writers, people, and wild themselves, so well worth the watch.",1376524800,4,189,5.064516129032258
5131061,5,B0084I7QMA,"If you love poetry, if you love documentary, if you love documentaries about poets, if you love America, this land we live on, how it was, how it's always been, and if you know the work of Gary Snyder, who for 60 years has been teaching us and delighting us with the fruits of his investigations... then this is the film for you. I was so happy when I saw that this film was here on Amazon. What a great feeling, to click that little button, and suddenly, there he was, the man himself, whom I discovered years ago in ""Turtle Island"" and in ""The Real Work,"" among others. As I watched the film, I remembered all the many things I'd forgotten... I mean, all the things he'd taught me, which I've been carrying around ever since and using all the time, I'd forgotten that it was Gary, he taught me these things! God bless you, Gary! May you live to be 101! And I'd like to know, who is the beautiful young woman who sits beside you at the dinner table?",1373328000,3,950,4.225274725274725

8525167,2,B0084I7QMA,"Glorious moments but flat in many places. Morrison is hard to watch and listen to, more focus on just Gary would have been preferred, more of his life and photos. Maybe more about the times and less dinner table talk. It was inspiring to hear him read his poems but I was left with wanting more about him. Bought the book, Distant Neighbors and am looking forward to it.",1448150400,,370,4.3768115942028984

8525169,5,B0084I7QMA,"A wonderfully beautiful, reflective, poetic film. It not only includes a number of sequences with Gary Snyder reading some of his poems, the filmmakers have put the whole film together like a poem. I love the exchange between Snyder and Jim Harrison and I thought the film brings out the character of each of these writers such that one really gets a sense of who they are and why one should take the time to read what they have written. I teach a course in the History of Buddhist philosophy and I introduced the introduction of Zen in the West through reading the unforgettable passage from Kerouac's Dharma Bums recounting his climb up Matterhorn peak with Gary Snyder. It was then really nice to show this film and have the students see Snyder's recollection of that ascent. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Gary Snyder, Zen, and poetry.",1430438400,3,861,4.708609271523179
