7879120,3,6304899122,"Good to find some AVP games. Sadly, the cassette runs for about 1 hour only. It comprises highlights only and not full matches from the 1997 summer: the King of the Beach, Hermosa Beach, Chicago, Orlando and the US Championships, as well as the FIVB world cup event. The highlights comprise the pivotal points and rallies from the finals matches of each of these tournaments. These are separated with interviews with some of the players. Players featured in the matches include Loiola, Steffes, Stoklos, Kiraly, Blanton, Ceman, Rogers, Holdren, Dodd, Johnson and others. It's a good chance to see Beach volleyball from the time of 'sideout' scoring (you can only score off your serve), so unlike the Olympics today, comebacks were in theory an ever-present possibility, no matter the score. In practice, however, in 1997 there was a rally-clock imposed by TV executives which limited the length of matches and actually prevented comebacks in some cases. It's also a chance to see these great players during the heights of the AVP-era. (The AVP went broke shortly after this.) Unfortunately the quality of my cassette was very poor but the seller was super-quick and helpful in addressing this problem. As it is impossible to find anything from this time, it's worth taking the risk given the price--depending on the postage costs to your part of the world, of course.  (If outside the US, take note that the cassette is in NTSC colour-format.",1481068800,,1442,4.983402489626556

Too bad they are not around anymore, I think the AVP went bankrupt.

7879124,2,6304899122,"I am a Health/PE teacher and bought this video to show students. We use teams of 3 or 4 and I wanted the students to see the strategy of forearm, set, attack, and block on each play that you see in beach volleyball. I was dismayed when almost every shot had advertising for Miller Lite in it. As a health teacher, I cannot promote alcohol in any way. I was able to use only one segment - the world championship between USA and Brazil.",1135814400,,434,4.178571428571429
