8690021,4,B00Q1QBQUK,Classic Ry Cooder with Flaco Jimenez and awesome band. Yes the video is not pristine which is typical of performances taped for TV in the 60's & 70's. But the music is sublime and infectious. The 1 star review is not a fair assessment. Most of this performance is on YouTube so it depends on whether you like to own or stream.,1460246400,,326,4.274193548387097
