2293766,1,B0009IWGDC,most are silent films this was very disappointing my dad was so excited about this and we got it and it was junk I do not recommend it at all!,1389916800,3,142,3.7666666666666666
2293767,3,B0009IWGDC,"The video was okay; however, the quality was not good. I know the film is old. I was under the impression the titles were full episodes instead of skits and silent movies. I will keep them but only one was fun to watch.",1387497600,6,219,4.116279069767442
2293768,4,B0009IWGDC,Given as a gift.  Only heard that it was good.  Did not play it at home nor did I see it.,1376956800,,89,3.1904761904761907
2293769,5,B0009IWGDC,"Got for my dad as a ""memory lane"" birthday gift.  He was very surprised and happy with what I did.",1375142400,,98,3.9
2293770,3,B0009IWGDC,"Not as good as I was expecting, Laurel and Hardy are always great, but this disc has a lot of filler content.",1359590400,,109,4.0
2293771,3,B0009IWGDC,viewing these dvds i found the quality was poor the pictures quality was not like most of the ones i have,1355702400,2,105,4.0476190476190474
2293772,1,B0009IWGDC,Item contained the worst L & H later movies and a group of short silent films with either L or H alone with other actors. A great rip-off  JP,1344384000,15,141,3.8620689655172415
2293773,2,B0009IWGDC,"Sons of the Desert (1933) is the crown jewel in any L&H collection, and with Charley Chase as their stellar comedy costar, the boys reached the pinnacle of their unique partnership, playing a pair of Fez-wearing ""Sons of the Desert"" sneaking off to a convention in Chicago, but their wives discover the ruse with hilarious results. For L&H fans, it simply doesn't get any better than this, although 1932's ""The Music Box"" shares equal status--and a 1932 Oscar for Best Comedy Short--in the L&H pantheon. The remaining shorts on the disc (""Another Fine Mess,"" ""Busy Bodies,"" and ""County Hospital"") were produced during the prime of Stan & Ollie's sound-era success (1930-33), each boasting their own timeless bits and flawless routines. Abundant laughs are virtually guaranteed.

The review is true,only thing is,these dvds don't contain sons of the desert,the music box,county hospital,or several others i especially ordered it for.",1303776000,14,932,5.297297297297297
2293774,2,B0009IWGDC,"Unless you are a die hard Laurel and Hardy fan, I would suggest you pass this item up. I expected to get Laurel and Hardy doing comedy together. Almost all the programs are silent and they are not the two in the typical comedy situations. You get tired of the piano music and trying to figure out where they are. So, I was not impressed with this product.",1206748800,41,355,4.235294117647059
