1882511,5,B00009AV7S,the kids love Timmy Turner & his fairly odd parents. They watch it all the time. If I'd let them they would watch it 24/7,1362009600,,121,3.88
1882512,5,B00009AV7S,"This is fun. Though there's no bonus episodes, the movie's great. Though I'd stick with Fairly OddParents season sets, this DVD is terrific.",1322352000,,140,5.130434782608695
1882513,5,B00009AV7S,"I wasn't the same guy I was 5 years ago. I never liked stuff like Transformers and Yu-Gi-Oh. I was more attached to The Fairly Odd Parents and Spongebob. I only saw this movie once before it went on the market 3 days later. I always thought that chocolate cupcakes with pink icing were ""Fairy-Versary Cupcakes"" (as opposed to it being a muffin in the movie). I was stoked when Timmy revealed Cosmo and Wanda's existence to Crocker and his parents. When he said it I was like ""No. Why did you do it bro?"" But anyway, I saw this on TV today and I thought about watching Channel Chasers which I will review next. I recomend this movie.",1238284800,,632,4.319327731092437
1882514,5,B00009AV7S,"This cartoon is hilarious! For any fan of the Fairly Odd Parents, this DVD is a real treat. I recommend it for children and adults alike. Some of the humor might escape most kids, but adults will pick up on it. In my opinion, this cartoon is better than Spongebob, because it is funnier, more engaging to a wider audience and more entertaining. To the people that make this cartoon, keep up the good work! There's plenty of fans that will keep watching Fairly Odd Parents for years to come.",1206230400,,490,4.455555555555556
1882515,5,B00009AV7S,"Maybe is the wittiest more intelligent cartoon I've ever seen since Dexter's Lab. The producers and writers have incredible ideas and their imagination is beyond belief.

Is a must have if you like animation with a very good storytelling.",1150675200,,238,5.102564102564102
1882516,1,B00009AV7S,"I can't believe everyone likes this show, it is the most annoying show with pointless stories that are filled with stupidity. I'd go and watch SpongeBob, he's a cool sponge that's hilarious.",1113350400,,190,4.96875
1882517,4,B00009AV7S,"Ever since ""Fairly Oddparents"" came out on Nickelodeon, it has been one of the most amusing cartoons for me to watch. Lately, Nickelodeon has shown this movie and it held my attention for the couple of hours that it was on. A cartoon must be funny if a teenager would willingly watch it. I recommend it for times of boredom.",1107648000,4,324,4.416666666666667
1882518,4,B00009AV7S,"It was o.k. I've seen it many times! My fave part was when the monkey threw his crap at Wanda . Cosmo was the best in this movie, he was so FUNNY. It was very, very cool!!!!!!!!

1882520,4,B00009AV7S,"Okay, maybe I was expecting a bit too much from a DVD that was rushed out, it was available for sale 3 days after the Nick premiere. I loved the movie when it was on Nick and I couldn't wait for the DVD because I wanted more information and more stuff. The DVD comes with a commentary done by Cosmo and Wanda, and a few behind the scenes specials. This DVD would have been perfect if it also included commentary by the writers and/or Butch Hartman, maybe behind the scenes of the actors who do the voices, or deleted scenes. And also where are the episodes of this show on DVD?? I would love seasons but compilation DVD's with lots of extras would be great too.",1067904000,,661,4.253968253968254
1882531,4,B00009AV7S,"The FOP TV series, like all the best cartoons, occasionally sneaks in something hilariously clever that you know the average child isn't going to ""get"".  Anybody who saw what I call the ""Where Is The Government Cheese?"" episode knows what I'm talking about!
I'm happy to say, this fine little movie continues the tradition, so if you're ""all grown up"", and watching it because, oh, let's say, you're stoned, and you want something easy on the mind, you just might find yourself rolling with awed laughter.
Of course, that's occasional -- this IS a thing for kids, and if you can't appreciate it on that level, oh well.  Likewise, the movie is every bit as, uh, ""dynamic"" as the series -- brash, loud, tinny -- you'll probably find yourself changing the volume constantly!  (Unless you've got some nice EQ setup.  Then, you may as well just turn the treble OFF.)
It ain't The Simpsons . . . It ain't even Spongebob . . . but, I dare say, it's pretty damned good!",1062028800,4,961,4.569767441860465
1882532,3,B00009AV7S,"Since I love the Fairly Oddparents, I loved this movie. Even though the parodies at the beginning were kind of unnecessary (watching the commercials I thought it would be throughout the movie). But seriously, people shoudn't get upset about it not being released theatrically. The critics would hate it, and it probably wouldn't do well in the box-office anyway, plus it would've taken longer to make.
The reason I give this DVD 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the special features. The only storyboards you see are the ones for the song. And I was hoping that Butch Hartman would do the audio commentary, not Cosmo and Wanda! That would please the naive little kids but not someone who's interested in the making of a series/movie. The behind the scenes are crappy too.
Still a good movie, though.",1060128000,,801,4.728571428571429
1882533,3,B00009AV7S,"""Timmy is an average kid
That no one understands""
Begins the upbeat musical opening to the ""Fairly OddParents"" Movie, ""Abracatastrophe,"" just as all the televised episodes begin on Nickelodeon.  The difference with ""Abracatastrophe"" is about 50 minutes.
There are good points to this movie, such as some of the dead-on parodies of movies such as ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Star Wars"" in the beginning (and anyone who doesn't care for Jar-Jar Binks will appreciate that parody even more), along with a funny variation of the ""Fairly OddParents"" song which ties into the movie's plot.
Timmy Turner's shenanigans take him into a new world when he has completed 365 consecutive days of keeping his secret about his Fairy Godparents.  To celebrate, the fairies from Fairy World show up to give him a party--along with gifts which include a glittering muffin that, to the partaker (preferably Timmy), gives the wish-maker one 'Rule-Free' wish--that is, without boundaries instead of the usual restrictions placed on children who have such fairy godparents--such as not being able to grant wishes about someone falling in love with you.  Unfortunately, the muffin's owner changes hands several times with disastrous results, and Timmy must get the muffin back before the Universe is changed forever.
That said, I continue by saying that the movie is just a bigger episode--a few more bigger-budget-looking computer animation sequences, another song or two, and some pretty good stereo sound, but on the whole, really just another episode.  I remember an episode where Timmy has changed the world by wishing that everyone was the same.  It's been done, although not quite to the scale of the movie.  I would have liked to see a movie where Vickie had more of a part and where his friends were with him.  The dynamic of Timmy's hatred for his babysitter and her mutual feelings for Timmy is great and are WAY underplayed here.  I'm not all that fond of Mr. Crocker, Timmy's crazy school teacher--the episodes without him are far funnier--but he plays an enormous role here.  There's not as much dimension to him as with the other characters because he's SO absorbed with proving that fairies really do exist.  What's funnier is the fact that everyone is so naively believing of Timmy's lies about why things are the way they are (especially his parents) and the way that his wishes get away from him.  That's the primary problem with this movie, I think--not enough wishes from Timmy--who has much more experience in making wishes, so it's fun to see what trouble he gets into by trying to wish even more creatively, having learned from past mistakes (or so we hope).
At least ""Abracatastrophe"" doesn't try to be more than it really is.  Yes, they did something that (they thought) was bigger to make it worthy of a DVD release--unlike many other pretentious animated movies that come directly from drawing board to the small discs.
Bottom line, I would recommend this movie only if you are a real fan of ""The Fairly OddParents"" and can overlook the movie's shortcomings.  If you aren't a fan and/or haven't seen the shows on Nickelodeon, spend your time on those first and then decide (If you start singing the opening song or it gets stuck in your head, you're on your way to becoming a fan).  Three stars for an effort ""Fairly Oddly"" executed.",1059696000,7,3331,4.9144385026737964
1882534,5,B00009AV7S,"This movie is one of the best direct-to-video/DVD movie of 2003. The movie starts off doing parodies of ""Star Wars: Episode II"", ""Spider-Man"" and ""Jurrasic Park"" and the film gets better. This is a great film for all kids and die-hard ""Fairly Odd Parents"" fans.",1059091200,,261,4.822222222222222
1882535,4,B00009AV7S,"This is a very good DVD. If you are a fan of the Fairly Odd Parents TV Show or if you just want to see something funny, give this DVD a shot. I thought it was quite funny. You won't completely get it unless you have seen the TV show, but you can still get the idea even if you haven't. All kids should be adding this to thier rental queues and adults might want to give it a shot. Overall, Very Good.
This is about Timmy's 1 year anniversary of having his godparents and he is given lots of gifts. Those gifts will all come in handy, when his magical muffin, which gives him a rule-free wish, is missing.",1058486400,6,604,4.041666666666667
1882536,5,B00009AV7S,"For Nickelodeon, they've really seemed to hit it big with some of their Nicktoons recently. There is no doubt about it. Especially with their recent cartoons, Jimmy Neutron and Chalk Zone. Still, nothing to mind seems to out-wish that theory better than The Fairly Odd Parents. The cartoon is sort of like the Cinderella story evolving around Timmy Turner, who gets some cool fairy godparents to cheer his life up. The godparents are also a little strange and straight. One of them, Cosmo, is like Timmy, with a short attention span, and the other Wanda, is the one that tries to keep Cosmo straight. Still, the wackiness can only end, if Timmy, tells his secret of having godparents around, and sending them back to Fairy World.
In the 2003 film, Abra-Catastrophe, which recently premiered on Nickelodeon, celebrates the first ever fairyversary that Timmy celebrates with his godparents. For his celebration almost every fairy gives him something very magical, from silly nose glasses, to a magical bag, and even Easter Eggs. But, that isn't it, Timmy also recieves the responsibility of a rule-free muffin, granting him one wish that can bend the rules. Unfortunately, Timmy loses his muffin, and tries to get it back, and tries not to get it in the hands of his fairy-demented teacher, Denzel Crocker. Sadly, things take a turn for the worse, twice.
The first time, when it falls in the hands of a monkey named Bippy, who turns the world into the one big global jungle, where apes rule the world. But, when the muffin gets in the hands of Timmy's mentally-estranged teacher, all war breaks out, as he captures Wanda, and it is up to Timmy and Cosmo to rescue her from his forceful danger. It is just an unbelieveable feeling, but shocking when Denzel captures Timmy's parents, Timmy blabs his unknown secret, that he has fairy godparents, to save all four of them, fairy godparents and Timmy's parents from Denzel's dangerous sight. However, once Timmy eats the muffin he gets back from Mr. Crocker, he gets his godparents back, and erases all memory from others that he has fairy godparents. Still, he almost loses them in the end, when the head fairy, tries to take them away, but Cosmo and Wanda try to get re-assigned back to Timmy. Thankfully, they became Timmy's fairy godparents.
I have to admit, Butch Hartman, who created The Fairly Odd Parents did a fantastic job creating this series from day one, back in 2001. Still, Butch has that in his bloodline away, as the brother of the late Phil Hartman from Saturday Night Live fame. I really love the series, and I loved the movie. He really should keep the magic moving, and create more fairy mayhem. It truly is the best animated series around right now.",1058400000,,2715,4.791044776119403
1882537,4,B00009AV7S,"How does a grown man review something called ""The Fairly OddParents: Abra-Catastrophe"" without looking like a complete fool? I'll start by saying it's a feature-length spin-off of one of the funniest TV cartoons I've seen in years.
For those not in the know, ""The Fairly OddParents"" is cable channel Nickelodeon's latest hit cartoon series, and deservedly so. It concerns 10-year-old Timmy Turner, whose only means of facing a kid-unfriendly world are Cosmo and Wanda, two fairy godparents willed upon him to grant him his every wish. Cosmo and Wanda can serve Tommy only as long as he never reveals his secret to anyone else.
This sounds a lot more precious than it plays. Butch Hartman, a former Cartoon Network writer who created and oversees the series, is definitely the right man for this cartoon. It has the kind of in-jokes, pop-culture references, and outrageous-looking settings and characters one used to associate with ""Rocky and Bullwinkle.""
As for ""Abra-Castastrophe,"" like most recent cartoon spin-offs, it provides more of the same, though if you're a fan of the show, that's hardly a bad thing. Basically, the movie has Timmy  do battle with each of the grown-ups who cause him grief in the series: Vickie, a babysitter with the sensibility of Eddie Haskell; Jorgen von Strangle, the fairy overseer who has a definite Schwarzenegger complex; and most of all, Timmy's science teacher, Mr. Crocker, whose obsession with proving the existence of fairy godparents sends his into spasms whenever he simply mentions them.
Why a movie? Because any cartoon that smells of demographic appeal these days is instantly spun off into a movie. (How opportunistic is ""Abra-Catastrophe""? Nickelodeon ""premiered"" it on their network three days before its release on DVD.) But at least this one, unlike ""Rugrats Go Wild"" and ""The Powerpuff Girls Movie,"" doesn't completely reek of cynicism, keeping the wacko tone of the TV show intact. It lags a bit in its climactic ""battle"" scene but picks up cheerily towards the end.
If you're an ""OddParents"" fan, you've probably seen the movie already and are waiting in line to buy the DVD as we speak. (I know I'm there!) Non-converts might want to watch a couple of episodes of the TV show first, to understand the ""back story."" But if you're into family-friendly cartoon comedy, it's worth the trouble.",1058313600,,2345,5.059431524547803
