5929661,4,B00EO87RH8,"Great Gift. Who doesn't like Harry Potter? Well, I don't that's why I bought this as a gift.",1418169600,,92,4.166666666666667
5929662,5,B00EO87RH8,Great DVDs. Can watch all the adventures one after another. Luv It!,1417651200,,67,4.666666666666667

5929664,5,B00EO87RH8,Yes the 4 film favorites did meet my expectations and I enjoyed watching the films.,1416873600,,83,4.6
5929665,5,B00EO87RH8,Just one word is enough for describing this: Awesome!,1415491200,2,53,5.0
5929666,5,B00EO87RH8,"Personally, I'm a Blu-Ray guy, but I purchased this set for my baby brother who's read the books and I gave him the first two movies on DVD for his birthday. (I'm also giving him movies 3 and 4 with this for Christmas.) They don't have a Blu-Ray player where he lives, so it was still DVD for him. I was glad to find this set for a low-cost but very acceptable way to get him the rest of the movies.

Note that this set is just the movie discs. If you're a type (like me) that enjoys hours of bonus features, you'd better look elsewhere. If you just want the Harry Potter films and don't need high definition video, this is one of now several options to get the last four films. There's sets of all eight films, the movies individually, and sets of two of the films together. Pick which is right for you and enjoy this well-done fantasy film series.",1414886400,8,849,4.208588957055214

5929669,5,B00EO87RH8,"Since I had already bought all the rest of the Harry Potter movies one at a time, I was looking to buy the rest of them to complete the set.  Instead of buying them individually, I was able to find this set for less than I would have spent on one of the movies separately.  What a surprise!  I am very pleased with them.",1402272000,2,320,3.96875
5929670,4,B00EO87RH8,Description doesn't say all four discs are crammed on top of each other in one box.,1442620800,,83,4.25

5929676,4,B00EO87RH8,Great set of movies. But now that we have had time to watch all of them we discovered that one of the DVDs doesn't work. The return window has passed. Is there any way to get the one DVD replaced?,1432425600,,196,3.925

5929718,1,B00EO87RH8,"Received the disks not realizing that they are different formats. They switch between widescreen and fullscreen. That's my bad, but the second disk of the set is messed up as well. You can actually see a water mark like blotch in the silver of the disk. This means it doesn't play right and gets grainy throughout the movie. Completely unwatchable. I wouldn't by this set unless you are ok with the format changing.",1420243200,7,415,4.698630136986301

8607329,5,B00EO87RH8,Was a little bit leery of the four movie package - they often tend to be low quality DVDs and have trouble playing on my old DVD player. But these played great and had no issues whatsoever! Awesome deal for what you get.,1485734400,,220,4.1395348837209305
