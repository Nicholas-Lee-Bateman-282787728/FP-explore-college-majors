8761617,4,B01FW3NB28,"I really liked this documentary, but I did only give it a 4/5 and here's why.

First of all, its at no fault to the band that I didn't give this video a 5/5, but some of the people surrounding the band. First of all, I get they're signing a big deal, and that comes with responsibilities, but let the kids just be kids for a little while. Seems like the adults (aside from the parents) are too busy arguing over direction than caring how the band is in their state of mind. Malcolm throughout gets frustrated at the process and I do think that is partially contributed to how much more work it was, vs what he thought it would be. I do think that he came to terms with it as the documentary went on, and that gets reflected in the music. I've listened to the album Chaos a lot, and really like it, for what it is and how young they made it at. I wish the documentary showed more of the final work they produced, but that's okay, it should hopefully entice you to look further into them if you already haven't.

I plan to support this band by any means I can, simply because they have so much potential. If Chaos doesn't show that, I don't know what does. Sure some of the songs are repetitive, but that's okay, they have to learn somehow. The lyrics are better than I would expect from kids to be honest, and give you somewhat of an insight of how they see the world they live in, and I like that. All this to say, I hope they continue to produce more and more music and develop their talent, and prove the people who might doubt them, wrong.",1521676800,,1542,4.153846153846154

8761622,5,B01FW3NB28,Very good rock & roll documentary. I liked it a lot.  I got it ordered at our local library and now lots of other folks will also have a chance to see it. Ask your local library to order a copy if you don't have the money to spend buying a copy. It's a great film.,1480118400,,264,3.7142857142857144

8761626,5,B01FW3NB28,"Although I am in the documentary, I must say BREAKING A MONSTER was a very honest portrayal of what was going on with the UNLOCKING THE TRUTH at that time in their lives.  They have since been ""mutually"" released from the Sony contract (Jan 2016); have a new management team; published a book (Unlocking the Truth: Three Brooklyn Teens on Life, Friendship and Making the Band); still performing; attending high school; independently released their CD CHAOS; and we are keeping this band wagon rolling.  Thank you for your continued support.",1476316800,4,540,4.988888888888889
