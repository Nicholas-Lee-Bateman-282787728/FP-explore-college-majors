8619107,4,B00FX6U19Q,"I do enjoy the old films and discovered this is a title I've never seen before.  Lloyd Nolan as his Michael Shayne private detective character.  Plot is a little far fetched with Michael serving on a court jury and his assistance in helping to solve the case.  But, a little plot liberty can be forgiven when I have the opportunity to watch a film I've never seen before and Lloyd Nolan is always entertaining.",1418688000,4,410,4.513513513513513
8619108,4,B00FX6U19Q,"American film noir circa 1945, so it'll be dark as it comes.  Not a bad picture, with good dialogue and acting.  It's short at 66 minutes.",1409443200,3,138,4.269230769230769
