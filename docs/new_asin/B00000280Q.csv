1177256,4,B00000280Q,"Artful sets and costumes, excellent casting and acting = a balmy evening's theatrical event. Plus, the singers are quite well in tune, which cannot be assumed in Verdi productions. The music? Well, I can't say it's much to the point. Now if the same libretto had been set by Rossini... However, the last act, the ghostly stuff, does finally reach the level of compositional subtlety and complexity to be emotionally effective. Five stars for that act, three stars for the first and longest parts, averaging about four stars.",1165881600,,524,4.965909090909091
1177257,5,B00000280Q,This DVD of a live performance of Falstaff is a good learning experience for a theater performance.,1126483200,7,99,4.882352941176471
1177258,5,B00000280Q,"What a delightful experience, this video or DVD!  The cast is A-One!  The names GiuseppeTaddei and Raina Kabaivanska conjure up dramatic roles such as Scarpia and Tosca along with Christa Ludwig, ever dramatic as well.  Yet, here they all are showing fantastic abilities with grand comedy!  A highlight for this listener is the patter-type quartet of Alice Ford, Meg, Quickly, and the lovely Nanetta, daughter of the Fords.  Taddei is beyond superb!  The flirtatious scene between Mistress Alice and Sir John Falstaff is so cleverly done, it is almost ""naughty "".  Kataivanska and Taddei are marvelous together.  The scene of the cloying Dame Quickly (Christa Ludwig), as she lures Falstaff to his ""tryst"" with Alice and/or Meg, is one of the most hilarious scenes in all comic opera! Rolando Panero, is wonderful, in frustrated anguish imagining his lovely wife planning a tryst with this buffoon, Falstaff!  As for the buffoon, few, if any basso, struts and minces quite like Taddei!  Shakespeare would have thoroughly appreciated the masterful music setting Verdi made of his ""Merry Wives of Windsor,"" and parts of ""Henry IV.""  Verdi, in turn, would have fallen in love with Maestro von Karagan and this brilliant cast of super artists!  Surely there has been no more SENSATIONAL performance than this one!  Opera devotee or not, if you like Shakespeare, surely you will enjoy this!",1103155200,40,1385,5.102222222222222
1177259,5,B00000280Q,"This is one of the best performances of Falstaff that I have seen. The singing, acting, and conducting are all first rate, and the the convential staging is very effective. And all that comes at a price much lower than other DVDs.",1088294400,20,230,4.5
1177260,2,B00000280Q,"This is more a warning than a review but I hope it will be useful since the price of this set is so attractive that it is easy to give in to the temptation of buying it. Unfortunately, it is a waste of money - I don't think I will ever watch this tape again. The quality of the transfer is very poor, with almost non-existent colour and - what is worse - very poor sound. But what really disqualifies this set is the lack of SUBTITLES! I want to make it clear because this production has been released before on the VAI label (it was made for British TV at the Glyndebourne Festival in the 1970s) and it WAS subtitled. Lack of subtitles will be a problem for many potential buyers; even those whose Italian is fluent may not be able to work their way through this set, simply because the sound quality is so poor that it is hard to distinguish any of the words. But if you know your ""Falstaff"" by heart, it may be a good experience especially as the performance doesn't seem too bad. There are not too many videos of ""Falstaff"" available at the moment so this set - particularly at this price - may be an answer to the prayers of many a fan of this delightful opera.",1017619200,3,1166,4.1866666666666665

Do it because you love the music, Verdi's greatest.
Do it because you love the performance, the greatest in my 65 years, since the age of 15, of listening to Verd's Falstaff.
Do it because this is one of Karajan's greatest achievements and he had a lot of them.

7902184,2,B00000280Q,"This is a beautiful traditional performance and one that I would normally be ecstatic with ... but unfortunately, the sound is out of synch with the picture.  Maybe not excruciatingly so, but noticeable and irritating.

I notice others using phrases such as the production is ""oddly photographed"" and the performers having strange expressions or out of breath.  I wonder if this is result of the synchronization error, and some not being aware, the brain compensating in other ways.

I have had a run of bad luck with opera DVD's being out of synch the past few months.  It's really disheartening.  I'm sure some will say, something's wrong with my equipment.  I will answer:  I have hundreds of DVDs, and the good ones still play good, and the same ones still play off.  And if anyone is interested, I have a recent Panasonic Blu-ray, and they play the same at my sister's house on her no-name from the 1990's.  So, unfortunately, I do know it's the DVD.

The next question, is there anything that can be done, other than sit there and suffer?  I'm contemplating buying an inline sound-delay box and I seem to have seen them advertised that are adjustable to the thousandths of second delay.  Unfortunately, they are not 'inexpensive'.  But if anyone has dealt with this problem, I'd love to hear any of your experiences.",1466380800,,1322,4.766519823788546
7902185,5,B00000280Q,"After buying and watching the ""Bozo the Clown"" version of this opera, I decided I hated it. But the other production is so awful---I had no idea how far off a production could be---it caused me to make the wrong call against the opera itself.

This production is wonderful. The timing it near perfect and the acting is very good. The singing is good to very good. This is a very wonderfully funny opera---a delight. This production conveys the poke at aristocracy intended by Shakespeare without being nasty. It's good fun.

Highly recommend.",1401408000,,542,4.817204301075269

7902187,5,B00000280Q,"This video of a 1982 Salzburg Festival performance of Verdi's last opera, and the only true comic opera in his prodigious output, has come in for mixed reviews. Previous reviewers on Amazon.ca have split into two who awarded 5-stars and two  who gave 1-star because they could not get their discs to play, a problem from which I was immune. I would like to start my review proper by dealing with the negative criticism published by 3 of 10 reviewers on Amazon.com who rated this 3-stars before adding my own evaluation. AI is the most derogatory, complaining of Karajan's tempi being too slow (in fact he paces the music  according to the speed of the action, and I have never heard a faster final fugue than that which Karajan demands of his players and singers). He is also dismissive of Karajan's direction. Until now, I would have agreed that as a director, he is a very dull stick, but only in the first scene of Act 1 did I find this comment justified, and I have never come across a director who could make much more with this intrinsically dull scene. On the contrary, I have never seen better comedy in the two scenes where Good Old Jack gets his well-merited double come-uppance. Even in the first scene of Act 3 where his second downfall is finessed by the Merry Wives and accomplices, every moment is milked for a laugh, with remarkable success. I never thought that Good Old Herbert had an ounce of humour in his entire body. And the overall acting is astonishingly good for its time. Even in today's opera houses where the stars have to be actors first and singers second, you will not find better examples of the thespian craft than right here, and if Karajan as director was not responsible, who was? Dismissed as a routine period production with ""old-fashioned sets"", I would have to say that I have never seen the opera any other way, and on the magnificent stage of the Festspielehaus at Salzburg, there was plenty of room for Schneider-Siemssen's atmospherically large period sets. As for his complaint about the camera work, I am at a loss to understand the reviewer's criticism. The overall visual impression is way ahead of anything that could be experienced in a live performance. The focus on groups, couples, individuals, or the entire ensemble is absolutely appropriate and emphasizes the drama and comedy in a manner complementary to the music and libretto. By the way, the English subtitles have been transferred from a new 1994 translation and they brilliantly surpass any previous format I have seen, live or recorded. The other two negative reviewers coalesced in criticizing the sound as being inadequate. I take issue with this. True, it is not DTS, but one has a choice of two stereo formats and as such, they are not too far behind what you can get today in the same formats.
Now, for myself, I enjoyed every moment of this performance (but the opening scene less so). It is funny. It is wise. It is righteously just, but it is also compassionate. The principles engage our empathy with their voices and their fine acting that projects the essence and the details of the characters they play. I was initially unhappy with Christa Ludwig, a great interpreter of German Lieder and German Opera  who on her first visit to the Garter Inn seemed to be uncomfortable with her transition to an Italian-English housewife, but she picked up speedily in the subsequent scenes. Taddei, of course, didn't simply sing or play Falstaff: HE WAS FALSTAFF. I had never even heard OF Raina Kabaivanska until I bought this disc, but she was an outstandingly wonderful match for the old fat rogue ---- singing with a powerfully dramatic intensity that was yet pure and humorous, effortlessly turning wit into music. The rest of the cast were stellar. It was a special treat to have Rolando Panerai in the same role he played when I attended Karajan's 1958 Salzburg Festival performance that featured Gobbi and Schwarzkopf in the leading roles. On balance, this was a more balanced production, and it is much superior to my mind than the Mutti version from the Teatro Verdi that many reviewers seem to prefer. I have not seen any of the other DVDs of this opera, but here is the crucial point: they are ALL at least twice as expensive as this performance that comes close to being definitive, and costs only $9. You don't often come across gift horses like this one, so don't just look it in the mouth.",1360195200,4,4417,4.704134366925064
7902188,3,B00000280Q,"Accordingly, it is for a colelctor and not a first choice...its an all star cast and conductor....and is as acheivable as is reasonable given the age of the production and the reproduction techniques.",1359158400,,200,5.090909090909091
7902189,5,B00000280Q,"Herbert von Karajan had two versions of Falstaff recordings, one in the 1950's with Tito Gobbi in the title role.
In this early 1980's recording at Vienna, the Sir John is Giuseppe Taddei, who, already 65 at the time of this recording, was a real force of nature in this comic role.  His voice still sounded young and mellow and rounded, with an imperfectly focused sound that he intelligently used to evoke a sound portrait of proud contentment rudely shattered by his unfortunate experiences at the minds and hands of the Merry Wives of Windsor.
Throughout the first scene Taddei's control and variety of dynamics is extraordinary.  He even achieves a shiver in his tone when he speaks of his substance being destroyed.  In ""Quand' era paggio"", he succeeds in detailing Falstaff's memories as a slender page with the utmost delight. After Falstaff was being thrown into the river by the Merry Wives, the sense of Falstaff's wet condition and degradation is a delightful performance full of the wisdom of a lifetime's art.  Taddei's voice more easily suggest girth than Tito Gobbi's, but Gobbi is more vivid in his articulation as in aa phrase like ""pinguo troppo"".
Panerai as Ford has lost some of his former lustre in the earlier Karajan set, but still steady, and he sings a wonderful contrast with Taddei in the Act 2 encounter between Falstaff and Ford.
As contrasted with other reviewers, I find the four ladies not as vocally poignant as Karajan's first set, but they are still wonderful.  Kabaivanska cuts a very convincing figure as Mrs. Alice Ford, while Ludwig is a witty Mrs. Quickly.
Particularly worthy of mention is the young couple of Anne and Fenton, who acts and sings with great chemistry and elegance.
As Nannetta, Janet Perry recovers from a shaky start to sing her fairy song in the last Act with ease and poise, but it is a young Francisco Araiza singing with great beauty as Fenton that steals the show. His lovely tenor voice is well-placed and sensuous, more so than Alva's (Karajan I) or Kraus's (Solti) though the other two handled the text more vividly.
The sets are very lovely and generally speaking, it is a very effective performance with great contribution from the VPO, Karajan and Taddei.",1349222400,5,2225,4.829396325459317
7902190,3,B00000280Q,"There is a lot wrong here. Old Karajan takes slow tempos and lazily plays with rhythms so the music has no spine or lift and many of these largely veteran singers have to struggle with breath so as to sustain his tempos. He is also given credit as 'director', which means despite handsome looking period sets, that this is a static, uninventive presentation, oddly photographed. The singers usually stare straight out and wait for their cues, though this is an opera full of give and take. Too often a bad camera angle is used for a soloist so the full face is only partially caught (it might have been that camera placement in the space was a problem) but sometimes the wrong person is the one getting the close up. Even in the two person scenes (Falstaff/Ford in scene l act 2) the camera doesn't catch the crucial interaction between the two men but lingers on one then clumsily cuts to somewhere unimportant then clumsily cuts to the other (usually at the wrong time) then clumsily cuts back.

In the first two acts, the singers, despite the long experience of most, are bland and remote, as though uncertain of the conductor and uncomfortable on the sets. People like Kabaivanska, Panerai, de Palma, Taddei know their way around this opera cold one would think but seem inhibited and none sings well (though of them all Panerai has the most tone left). The great Taddei as fat Falstaff -- the character's size is constantly referred to in the opera -- doesn't really look obese here (though he usually did because he really was -- it looks like he's either been on a serious diet or has been ill) has trouble moving, and is seriously short of breath. Ludwig is too sunny, without the more sarcastic quality written into Dame Quickly, also without the booming low notes. Janet Perry and Araiza as the young lovers look like the grandchildren (or great grandchildren) of these people, not their children, and they are dull too, without any tonal glamor.

But much changes in act three. Karajan comes alive (relatively). Though the camera work remains clusmy, and the fancy filming of what occurs in Windsor Forrest is silly and doesn't work, the singers look for all the world like they've said 'to hell with it' and all give the performances one would have expected from them all along (or it may simply have been taken largely from a different performance than the first two acts).

Taddei in particular is suddenly verbally acute, witty, bitter, touching and funny. His voice sounds rounder and is under better control and he seems more comfortable moving (and he is very game in allowing himself to be carried around). There is a second in scene ll where he catches Panerai's eye during the finale and the twinkle and smile between them is magic. The others are all better except for the two youngsters. Perry lacks the vocal magic Nannetta's great solo requires, and Araiza likewise is ordinary in his short but lovely aria (to be fair, the pretty Perry is gotten up in a mightily unflattering costume).

Those who saw Taddei make his Met debut in this opera some years later (with De Palma) saw a much better performance; both were wonderful, but Taddei was magical. Only in act three and really only to a lesser degree is that true here. (those up on the opera underground will know there is a video of Taddei and other veterans in a semi-staged concert performance even later than the Met, where despite the absence of set, costumes and more than minimal staging he and colleagues are all hilarious and, where need be, touching). Karajan's earlier sound recording on EMI (with a virtually perfect cast including Gobbi and Moffo, all in excellent form) is a far better example of what he could do with this miraculous work.",1263686400,17,3733,4.712098009188361
7902191,4,B00000280Q,"I bought this for Giuseppe Taddei, one of the all-time great Italian baritones.  And he is clearly one of
the great Falstaffs.  Many have praised Renato Bruson's take on the title character, but for me is a
bit too dignified and even solemn.  I'll take Taddei's Falstaff any day.  (Although I really liked
Paul Plishka's interpretation.)  The other great performance here is Panerai's Ford, which could
hardly be better.  The ladies and young lovers are good but not outstanding.  I don't know why
Chista Ludwig took so much criticism - this great mezzo is perfectly fine as Quickly.  And for me
it is a major bonus to have two of the best comprimario tenors, Piero de Palma and Heinz Zednik,
as Caius and Bardolfo. Karajan's production is not the best but is more than adequate.  At this
price, this is well worth purchasing.",1261699200,3,826,4.72027972027972
7902192,3,B00000280Q,"They're all great... except the sound quality!
Giuseppe Taddei is as wonderful an actor as he is a singer... All the ladies are gorgeous (and I do have a special affection to Christa Ludwig... her ""reverenza""s are lovely... almost sexy). Karajan's direction, though on the slow side, is never dull. Except for the orchestra (VPO v/s BPO) there is no mahor difference between this and the Philips / DG recording, except that this is hampered by a very poor sound quality and a too audible a hiss. How come Sony did not re-master this recording?
At any case, try the La Scala / Muti or Giulini... Both deserve a 5-star + !!!",1249430400,4,622,4.5625
