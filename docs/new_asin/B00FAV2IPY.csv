5973738,5,B00FAV2IPY,"I am a gym freak, have always needed lots of variety to keep working out. Did p90x , brazing butt lift, and have had lots of gym memberships. This workout is by far THE BEST. It's hard work, but love that there is water breaks and it is easy to use. It's only 30 mins and the workouts fly by! So much fun and a lot less money than anything else I have purchased so far due to the quality of what you get.",1388620800,2,404,3.8214285714285716
5973739,4,B00FAV2IPY,"I prefer the original series, but Dasha is excellent in this one as well.  It's a great add on and Double Cardio will kick your glutes!",1386892800,,135,4.1923076923076925
5973740,5,B00FAV2IPY,"I've been working out with this set for a couple of weeks now. This is hands down the best system I have ever done. I absolutely love these workouts! For reference, I regularly workout to Tonique, Dream Body, Bob Harper, several barre workouts, um, I'm sort of an at home workout dvd junkie for sure! I have done Jillian's kettlebell dvd and just did not get a whole lot from it, although I have long ago surpassed the level of her workouts. I have also done Bob Harpers kettlebell workouts. His are good and challenging but my low back always hurt while doing them. Now I know why. Dasha teaches form to perfection. I have not experienced any low back pain since doing these. Well, I have when my form is off. She has a great intro dvd that I do once a week just to perfect my form. Really helpful. Now when I do Bob's kettlebell workouts I use proper technique and cringe at the horrible form displayed by the exercise demonstrators on his 2 dvd's. I have already seen physical results--abs, legs, arms, butt! My endurance has improved as well. Dasha instructs not to over do it but I find that I enjoy doing a cardio, leg or glute, and arm or core workout in one training session. I feel great when I'm done and I sweat like I've never sweat before! Seriously, I go through a lot of water with these! These just click with me. I have so much fun with the kettlebell/kick boxing blend. Dasha is so personable, intelligent and knowledgeable. I don't find her annoying in the least. I'm not sure why many have found her irritating. She works the hell out of me and that is exactly what I want in a workout. She and her team do it with me! It's great. She shows modifications and advanced moves to work toward. She promises results and I can attest that if you work hard with this system you will get the results you want. I started with this set and I love it so much I am going to order her first set right now. I hope she produces more because I will buy anything she puts out! So, I very enthusiastically recommend this, indeed!",1383350400,13,2031,4.319371727748691
5973741,5,B00FAV2IPY,"This is the first Kettlebell Kickboxing set by Dasha Liben that I have purchased; I don't own the earlier Scorcher series, but ended up purchasing this Body Series after it had been getting rave reviews on the Video Fitness forum.  I have only done a few of the workouts, but I really like it so far, and have found the workouts to be a lot of fun!

As a bit of background about myself, I've been using kettlebell workouts for about five years.  I took in-person classes with Lauren Brooks and own two of her DVDs, along with owning DVDs by Anthony Di Luglio, Beth Chamberlin, Keith Weber, Andrea Du Cane, Phil Ross, and Amy Bento Ross.  This Body Series with Dasha Libin is unlike any of those other workouts, and I love how unique, fun, and hard it is!

The eleven DVDs come in a thick jewel case with a rounded edge that is just over 1  inches thick.  Since some of the workouts are short, it would have been much nicer if they had out more than one workout on each disk to the case would take up less room.  The space issue is a minor quibble, but I also hate cases like this where you have to pop out a disk to get at the disk below it.  I ended up moving this set into a DVD folder so that I don't have to do this, and so I don't have to worry about breaking a DVD while trying to get it off of the tight spindles.

The program also comes with a booklet that provides nutrition information and various training schedules.  The nutrition information provides an overview of clean eating, and gives recommendations for how to eat clean and why it's important to avoid things like starchy carbs.

There are four training schedules given:  one for the deconditioned person, one for the moderately active person, one for the athletically active person, and one for the athlete.  (Dasha gives an explanation of each one, so you know where you're at.)  Based on your level, there are then 60-day programs listed for each point, and, regardless of what level you're at, she suggests you start with the Beginner workout just to review form and her techniques.

In each of the workouts, there is one person who is using a dumbbell, so you don't need a kettlebell to do the workouts, but I'd suggest getting at least one since it will make a difference in how you move.

Each workout has four menu options:

* Play Full Workout
* Play Workout on Mute (so you can play your own music)
* Play Workout with Music Only
* Play Workout without Warm-Up or Cool Down (this isn't an option for the Beginner and Joint Mobility workouts since they include the warm-up as part of the workout)

Instead of a countdown timer for the entire workout (which I would have preferred), there is a counter for each workout that gives the percentage of the DVD that is completed and a countdown timer only for the move you're doing.

Although I haven't done all of the workouts yet, I have previewed each one.  Since I wasn't able to find the workout times anywhere online, I've also kept note of them and have included them below.  The 11 workouts are as follows:

*  KB 101- BEGINNER & REVIEW - 57:38 minutes.  The first few minutes are Dasha's overview of the Body Series.  This workout is just Dasha and Janelle (sp?), and Dasha gives really excellent form pointers!  Dasha even does some of the moves incorrectly (with poor form) so you can see what good and bad form looks like side by side.

*  KB CARDIO LEAN 2.0 - 34:45 minutes. The focus is on keeping your heartrate up.

*  KB CARDIO 40/20 BURN - 33:51 minutes. It has tabata-style intervals of 40 seconds of work, and 20 seconds of rest.

* DOUBLE KB CARDIO - 33:25 minutes.  This workout uses two kettlebells of the same size.  It is just Dasha and Janelle in this workout, and is meant to be a more advanced workout.

* ABSOLUTE ABS AND CORE: SHAPE & DEFINE - 41:48 minutes. Even though the focus is on abs, Dasha includes a lot of cardio moves. In addition to a kettlebell, you also need a mat for some of the moves.

*  AMAZING ARMS: SCULPT & STRENGTHEN - 38:26 minutes. It has a lot of punching drills in it than some of the workouts since the focus is on the upper body.

*  LIMITLESS LEGS: LEAN & LENGTHEN -- 47:00 minutes. It has a nice mix of moves like dead lifts, interspersed with cardio moves to get your heartrate up.  I have a tendency towards tendonitis in my knees, and this is very knee-friendly.

*  PERFECT BUTT: LIFT & SHAPE - 42:32 minutes.  This has a nice focus on kicks and cardio drills.  All of the KB swings are also good for shaping the glutes.

*  JOINT MOBILITY: RECOVERY & FLEXIBILITY  -- 43:24 minutes.  For all of the training schedules, Dasha has you doing this at least once or twice a week.  Besides just using a kettlebell, you'll also need a mat and a foam roller to do this one.  She also has you use a wall to stretch out.

*  TRAIN ANYWHERE:  NO KETTLEBELL WORKOUT - 28:24 minutes.  This workout is a no-kettlebell workout that is designed to use kettlebell principles, but on the go so you can use it while traveling.  You also don't need a lot of space, and Dasha mentions that it's a shorter workout since most people who are traveling don't want to spend too much time working out.

*  BUDDY WORKOUT - 24:46 minutes.  This is a ""bonus"" workout, and has six total exercisers in it.  You just need one kettlebell for it, and you alternate drills with a workout buddy, and encourage that person to do the various exercises.  I haven't yet tried this one, but I plan on doing it with my husband since it looks like a lot of fun!

Except for the Beginner, Double KB, and Buddy workouts, all of the workouts have Dasha and three background exercisers in them.  All four are in amazing shape, which I always find motivating.  One is barefoot, and the other three are wearing tennis shoes.

Also, each workout starts with a very short FBI warning and clip for the series, but you can skip over them, which I love.  (I hate having to wait several minutes to get a DVD to load!)

As I mentioned, I don't have the first Scorcher Series, but I've read that people wished that Dasha didn't chat quite as much.  In this one, people have said that she chats less.  I find her comments in this series to be really helpful, and I love how she constantly remind you of form pointers.

I plan on doing these for the next month following the Advanced rotation, and will update my review as I work my way through them.  For now, though, I can tell that this series will be fun to do and will provide lots of variety!",1380326400,29,6476,4.343619683069225
8613909,5,B00FAV2IPY,"I have had this set for about a month and a half now, and I also owns a scorcher series. The scorcher series is more intense while this workout is more laid back. I like this workout DVD series because it breaks down specific areas to work on but also because Dasha is more informative about how the moves work and shape your body. I found this workout to be a nice compliment to the scorcher series.",1454803200,,400,4.207792207792208
8613910,5,B00FAV2IPY,Awesome product! 3 weeks in and all ready seeing results!,1430006400,,57,4.8
8613911,5,B00FAV2IPY,"These are great workouts!  Have all three sets of her DVDs and just love them.  Dasha is so right about following a program!!  With these workouts and her guided program, I have lost twenty pounds, feel great, and have much better mobility, strength and balance.  This has become my go to program for over a year now and for many more to come.  Dasha is so positive, provides great guidance on form and you just get the sense she really cares and loves what she does.  Kudos to her programs!!",1422921600,,492,4.411111111111111
8613912,5,B00FAV2IPY,"As a devoted Scorcher girl, I was super excited when the Body Series was released. Id been itching for more KBB, and this delivered.
This is a bit different in presentation and format from the Scorcher series, but thats not a bad thing. I enjoyed that the Body series had body-part focused workouts (butt, abs, arms) as well as some full body type stuff (40/20, Lean 2.0). The Body series also included a buddy workout (this one is way fun) and a travel workout. The travel workout is especially nice when I don't have a lot of time, or if perhaps I just want a short workout to wake me up and stretch me out.
The Body series also comes with a bit of a nutrition guide. Its not complicated. Theres no freaky special menus. Its just sensible eatingyou cant go wrong.",1413936000,,765,4.394366197183099
8613913,2,B00FAV2IPY,I haven't really been able to stick with this program. I get bored with it quickly it seems like Dasha talks too much.,1413590400,2,118,4.173913043478261
8613914,4,B00FAV2IPY,"I am enjoying the system. I bought it originally because I loved the Scorcher Series, but wanted more variety.  I thought it was a less intense system than the Scorcher Series. Then I upgraded to a 15lb Kettle bell. It is just as intense. I like that this series focuses on different areas of the body. I also like that there are many new moves to keep it fresh. The DVDs are not really timed, they instead show what % of the workout is done as you go along. I have noticed that each DVD is between 35-45 minutes in length. If they are done correctly you will be sweating when you are done. Dasha does what  she calls 40/20 in these, meaning working out for 40 seconds and resting for 20 seconds. During the rest periods you can rest or do what she calls active rest. Active rest is basically just continuing to move but not at full pace until it's time for the next segment. I love this workout. You get cardio and weight training in. Kettle bell Kickboxing is the first exercise that I have done that makes me want to work out. I actually miss it when I don't get to do it. I recommend this series for anyone who wants to get into shape. It is work so if you are looking for something easy this is not it. If you are already in shape and want to tone up this is also for you. Hope this was helpful!",1401321600,2,1300,4.1141732283464565
8613915,2,B00FAV2IPY,"I have over 200 DVD workouts and was excited about adding a kettlebell routine to my collection.  I have tried a few of the DVDs in this collection and when it's over still can't wait to get started.  It feels like I didn't even do anything.  I do have other kettlebell workouts that put this one to shame.  A waste of money, if I bought it in a store I would have returned it.",1400284800,4,377,4.054054054054054
8613916,5,B00FAV2IPY,"I LOVE THIS WORKOUT dvd set!!! So much!  I've done all of them except the 2-fer one where she has you workout with a buddy.  I've never picked up a kettlebell or even took a kickboxing class (I've only done p90x at home!) so its all new to me and extremely exciting!! LOVE this so much.  She is not annoying or frustrating, she is a really cool person and motivating!! I wish I could take one of her classes one day!! awesome set. highly recommend!",1400025600,,448,4.247058823529412
8613917,5,B00FAV2IPY,"I'd never done kettlebell kickboxing or any kettlebell workout before buying this and I love this set.  I can definitely see a change in my body.  I like workouts that are relatively short and the longest one in this set is about 45 minutes.  Dasha works in rest periods where you can get water and catch your breath.  They show beginner, intermediate, and advanced versions of each move.  I would recommend this to anyone.",1397865600,2,423,4.662162162162162
8613918,5,B00FAV2IPY,"I really enjoy Dasha's kettlebell kickboxing DVDs; for me, it's the perfect union of exercise styles that I gravitate toward and always come back to to get the job done.  I have used Lauren Brooks for years for kettlebells, and also practice Physique 57 and some Runervals DVDs to stay fit.  Dasha will now be part of my rotation.

Dasha IS talking constantly.  That being said, I did find her to be very knowledgeable and had valuable information to share and I even tweaked my form a bit after all these years.  She has clearly researched training the female form and I enjoyed learning some new nuances to that end. The DVD play options thoughtfully include a mute option as well as playing the workout with music only which was a smart production choice that others could learn from.  After doing the workouts once and listening, I now mute them and use my music.  Perfect.  Like another reviewer, I prefer to have a timer countdown for the entire workout not just individual segments but its certainly not a deal-breaker.

The workouts themselves are efficient and effective and the time seems to fly.  I always appreciate how I don't have to put in a lot of time when using kettlebells and still get a fantastic workout and I enjoy Dasha's use of the interspersed martial arts moves for variety.  If I want more of a purist kettlebell workout, I use Lauren Brooks.",1392940800,3,1370,4.643153526970955
