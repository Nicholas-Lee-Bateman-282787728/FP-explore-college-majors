8130553,4,B000GBTQJE,"The movie ""Death of a Cheerleader"" was a great movie.  Tori Spelling's acting was great.  But the girl who played the murderer was poorly cast.  She looked way too cute to accurately portray her role.  With some makeup, they could have make her look more believable.
The other movie ""Deadly Pursuits"" was just....good.  Again, Tori Spelling's acting was great.  Not so much her co-star.",1498348800,,386,4.953125

It was a real good movie.
