5685404,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"I am so glad I came upon this new televion series called RECTIFY. It is like no other t.v. series I have ever seen.  The basic storyline is about a man Daniel Holden, (Aden Young), who has been on death row for nineteen years for the murder of his girlfriend when he was 18 yrs. old.  His legal team has found that the DNA on the girl's body was not his and so they have let him free, for the time being, to go back home.

I will warn you the show moves very slowly but in a mesmerizing fashion.  The directing, acting and photography are very well thought out and filmed more like a feature film.  (SPOILER:  So far, after episode six, we do not really know if he is guilty or not but our suspicions are that he is such a caring and insightful person he couldn't possibly commit such a heinous crime.)  The problem might be that we have yet to see what he was like at eighteen.

I cannot express how well this program is made.  Every detail has been thought out and there is poetry to its expression, its dialogue, its town and its cast.  The cast is outstanding with a group of actors that I am not quite familiar with.  Two that stand out are Daniel's sister Amantha played by Abigail Spencer, who I do remember for her brief role in MAD MEN, and Adelaide Clemens who plays Daniel's sister-in-law Tawney who tries to pursuade Daniel to find Jesus and be reborn.  You might think the main character is over acting but what do we, as the audience, know what it is like to be incarcerated for nineteen years in solitary confinement.  His mannerisms are quirky and uncomfortable.  He has forgotten what it is like to live in ""the real world"".  He has to readapt to the enviroment that was taken from him half his life ago.  It's a tough role to play.

The other actors, mostly members of his family and extended family, are wonderfully played.  It is one of those programs that you cannot wait to watch the next episode.",1366934400,12,1919,4.312849162011173

The portrayal of a man who struggles to make sense of an unfamiliar world after being on death row since he was a teenager, is finely and deeply crafted.  There are no easy answers, no hackneyed plot lines, just an arrow piercing the inner darkness and freeing something beautiful. A work of art.",1494201600,,433,5.084507042253521

5685451,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"When he was only eighteen years old, Daniel Holden (Aden Young) was arrested and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of his then-girlfriend, Hanna Dean.  He spends the next eighteen years on Georgia's death row and is released after his sentence is vacated, due to the finding of some new DNA evidence and the herculean efforts of his feisty sister Amantha (Abigail Spencer).  How this horrific event and his release affect Daniel and those closest to him is, in a very general way, the subject of ""Rectify"".  But it is so much more than that.  Written and directed by Ray McKinnon, this series explores the very profound ways his newfound freedom inform all of Daniel's emotions and decisions, and demonstrate both the power of love and redemption as well as revenge and self-preservation.  There is a feeling of foreboding throughout, as you know almost from the start that the then-prosecutor turned state Senator Foulkes (Michael O'Neill) plans to re-try the case to prove he was right about Daniel's culpability.  The ensemble cast is terrific, as they each have their part ot play in Daniel's re-entry in life, and some, of course, do a better job than others.  But it is Aden Young as Daniel who is mesmerizing to watch.  His brooding, sensitive inner core always shines through, but his very understandable anger and, as well, his maladroit fumblings with human interactions due to his long confinement, are portrayed with immense compassion and understanding. Abigail Spencer as the indefatigable Amantha is equally riveting to watch, and the rest of the actors due a great job as well.  I personally thought this series could have used one more episode, which is unusual, as they generally go a bit too long.  Still, it's a more than worthwhile investment of time and yes, emotions, because ""Rectify"" will make you think and feel.",1483660800,,1847,4.929032258064516
5685452,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"Best series ever.  Rich characters, superb actors, believable dialogue, brilliant writing and an intriguing story.  What more can be said?  Well a lot more but just watch it and see how it makes you think and feel.  Truly a brilliant series.",1483574400,,241,4.804878048780488

5685457,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"A most unusual show but one that not only entertains you but makes you take a look at what life is possibly like for someone who is wrongfully convicted of a crime.  This story follows Daniel and his family in the aftermath of Daniel's 20 year confinement on death row for a crime he didn't commit.  Ray McKinnon wrote a brilliant drama here.  Nothing like I've ever seen on network television.  I have seen all four seasons but had to buy the first three seasons (and will buy S4 when it's released) because I will watch it again.  From start to finish, it will make you think, make you cry, make you question the justice system and the people who are really interested in pursuing justice or simply trying to further their own career.  As someone who is not easily entertained with fluff on television, I have to say that Rectify was not a waste of my time and I'm grateful for Mr. McKinnon, his writing and the cast who brought his words to life.",1482019200,6,949,4.394285714285714

It presents a painful, poignant story of the impact on family and community of a man who had spent a decade on death row whose sentence was vacated.  Character roles were portrayed by an amazing cast of actors.  Kudos to Ray McKinnon for the story, to the cast of actors, the beautiful cinematography. The fact that the shows and the actors were snubbed by the Emmy academy is impossible to understand.

It is in such slow motion, to strings and piano, that it verges on creepy. Like syrup that has a dose of opium added in.

Both had me inspired with their loving human look into the lives of flawed but basically good people doing their best  to find an antidote for life's pain and I think finding it in a simple act of kindness, or an honest acceptance.  in short in an expression of a the best we can offer one another our love.

5685497,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"The six-episode first season of the Sundance original television series ""Rectify"" is absolutely spectacular, and it is widely considered to be one of the best television programs ever created. Season 1 begins with the release of Daniel Holden from prison and death row, after his murder and rape conviction at age 18 was vacated, based on DNA evidence which has temporarily exonerated him. The focus of Season 1 is on the manner in which the lives of all of the immediate family members, neighbors, friends, and enemies of Daniel Holden are forever changed in their small southern town, after his unexpected release from prison. The writing is creative and original, the plot and story line are layered and spellbinding, and the character development and acting are truly brilliant. My wife and I watched the entirety of the first season of ""Rectify"" on a rainy and dreary Saturday night, which provided the perfect backdrop for the binge watching of such a dark and somber television show.

5685549,1,B00C1LIZMQ,"When I first began watching this program I thought it was going to be a great show.  It seemed fascinating at first, but quickly lapsed into the realm of repulsive.  Basically, if they banned any reference to sexual obsession and took off any scene which involved abuse sexually or preoccupation with exposing you to watching someone's deviant sexual experience, they could compile the whole series into a short single season.

The way that this show strikes me is similar to the mechanics of molestation.  The person who does the violation gets you to try to care about them by manipulating emotions.  They suddenly throw some sort of inappropriate touch or viewing of sexual nature and then they tell you that it is okay- you just have to care about them and because you do, you just overlook the dirty feel you have by what they exposed you to.  The same type of behavior happens over and over again, getting worse and worse ...so goes the way of the molestation experience.

That is how it feels to watch this show to me.  It had great possibilities, but instead of taking it to places of intelligence, it instead relies on shock value mixed with sexual obsession to numb the viewer and manipulate emotions.

I know that some will not agree, but that is how I see this show.  It is like the script was written by a twisted mind of an inmate incarcerated for sexual abuse who is a mastermind of manipulation bent on continuing their routine of polluting minds.",1437609600,6,1463,4.635658914728682
5685550,3,B00C1LIZMQ,"This show is very well written and the acting is stellar. Excellent show. However, I give it 3 stars for two reasons. I enjoy watching the show but it moves very, very slow. It kinda of reminds me of ""Terms of Endearment"". It is what I would call Heavy Drama. I enjoy watching the acting and some of the scenes with long dialog, but they could skip a few scenes and it would not affect the story or the show. The other flaw is I do not believe or buy into the relationship between Tauny (Tammy) and Daniel. It is just not believable and I don't feel like there is any real love between them.",1437436800,,591,4.147826086956521

5685572,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"Some few times a year we hear a story about a prisoner being released after some ungodly long time because of DNA evidence. But we rarely hear what happens after that. This is a close examination of the circumstance.

Here's the scoop. Daniel Holden (Aden Young) is released from death row on DNA evidence. The problem lies in the fact that he's spent 20 years there and now needs to reacclimate himself to an outside world that has passed him by. Add to that the fact that some of the people in this small, southern areal still think he's guilty. This all makes for a very dicey situation.

Truth be told I'm not through the entire first season as of yet. I feel compelled to write this review because what I've seen so far is amazing. The Daniel Holden character is one of the best characters I've seen in any series. Other characters in the series note him as having been an ""odd"" young man. While in prison he practiced some form of meditation. He's also extremely well read in literature, history, philosophy et al. He expresses himself eloquently. You know the story isn't as it seems but you also know it will take some time before all the cards are on the table. Many people have heir own agenda and benefit from him in not remaining a free man. Others of course feel he is, in fact, innocent. What works here is the subtle nuance on what it means to be set free on, what amounts to, a technicality.

Aden Young is outstanding. His near constant amazement at how the world has changed in 20 years is something to behold. He's also been given some great dialogue to deliver. Everyone else I've seen so far has been good in their roles. What really surprised me was it's creator, Ray McKinnon, has a long history as an actor but almost no history as a writer/director/producer. It's like stepping up as a rookie in the big leagues and planting a grand slam out of the park.

This is a great series by any measure. Enjoy.",1426809600,,1926,4.432203389830509

young inhabited the character of daniel. he wasn't just ""acting"" daniel. i can't say enough about the lighting and camera work. whoever was behind the camera knew exactly how to bring out the best in mr. young's face. in an article i read, someone said ""the camera loves aden young's face.""

indeed.

the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne was cinematic in scope. the whole first season seemed like a film. from the opening and the first close-up of daniel, i was hooked. i suppose mesmerized might be a bit much, but then again, maybe not.

5685600,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"It's criminal that this show was snubbed by the Emmys.  In terms of character-driven dramas, this is about as good as it gets.  With its gravitas and slow burn intensity, it's a very different show than Friday Night Lights, another all-time favorite, but what Rectify shares with FNL is that all too rare quality of a profoundly immersive experience in which you are sucked inward from the state of viewing the story to living and feeling it.  It takes great writing, great acting, a realistic story with well crafted, relatable characters you can care about to transport an audience in this manner, but Rectify delivers splendidly.  Show creator, Ray McKinnon is supremely talented and someone to keep an eye on.

The ONLY problem with Rectify is that it is compromised by the miserable picture quality of all shows that air on the Sundance Channel.  Hey, Mr. Redford, we're well into the 21st Century!  Please quit hobbling your indy gems, like this show and The Honorable Woman, with the mushy, grainy look of having been shot in Super 8mm.  Start transmitting your programming in HD like the rest of the telesphere and give these great little shows the resolution respect commonly accorded to dreck like soap operas and ""reality"" shows.  Until that happens, my advice is to catch this fine show in reruns on Netflix/Amazon Instant/Hulu/Vudu or the like -- or buy the DVD set -- to see Rectify in the picture clarity with which it was shot.",1410048000,2,1443,4.809716599190283

5685611,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"So unusual to find something of this depth on television, despite the renaissance of quality television drama. It's almost impossible to name a best actor - the entire ensemble is superb. The pace of the show is initially slow - mirroring that of the protagonist's reentry in some ways - but please invest in the first few episodes and you will get a wonderful payoff.

It is a sometimes uncomfortable experience watching this series. Not because of the circumstances of the protagonist so much as because of his character itself. I can't really elaborate without spoilers. The foundation theme, of course, has its own discomfort. I suspect that this will be an emotional roller coaster, but it will definitely not be a happy pill.

5685618,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"I tuned in to Rectify because of my interest in wrongful convictions, but this is a show that transcends its subject matter. Rectify is to TV crime dramas what Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is to potboiler whodunits. The show touches on themes that no doubt attract viewers to crime dramas: meaning, God, hope, justice, family and the dilemma of being human, yet it doesn't attempt to answer these questions with platitudes or neatly resolve them. Aden Young, the actor playing Daniel Holden, is brilliant and compelling: he never quite looks the same from one shot to the next making him fascinating to watch. You think you know him, then you aren't so sure. Some may recall Abigail Spencer, who plays Daniel's sister Amantha from Mad Men in the role of Suzanne, Sally's teacher and one of Don's paramours. She is as lively in Rectify as in Mad Men but is a far more complex and darker character here, having lived with a brother on death row for 19 years. The show is not a prison show but there are flashbacks to Daniel's time in the 9 x 6 cell that is his death row domicile. He uses that time to read, to think, to meditate, to gain a perspective on existence that is rare and precious. And yet his emotional growth is stunted since he was just 18 when sentenced and had little life experience. One imagines that monks who live in isolation might possess this same eerie wisdom coupled with emotional immaturity. Take that eerily wise yet naive man and toss him back into Pally, a tiny town in Georgia full with simple, close-minded folk, most of whom believe Daniel is guilty despite DNA exoneration and you have a disparity that is unnerving. Amantha meanwhile has been living in Atlanta near the lawyer who represents Daniel, and has a sophistication that also is at odds with a one-horse town like Pally. This series is so beautiful at times it hurts, but is never once boring or slow. There are a few films that approach the brilliance of Rectify but they are the kind you remember your whole life. Rectify is moving, thought-provoking, growth-inducing and engrossing: I cannot recommend a series more highly.",1408233600,,2123,4.694369973190349

5685659,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"Despite the fact that not much happens on this show (no car chases), it was very engrossing and very difficulty to stop watching after one episode. There is something special about it. The characters are so well-developed and multi-dimensional. There are no bad guys/good guys here. Even the most disliked character has a motive for the way he/she acts. For example, Teddy acts like a jerk at times but you can see that he does it because he loves his wife and he has his doubts about Daniel. It's easy to sympathize with every character a little bit. Also, rarely does a TV show make me cry, but this show (episode 6) moved me to tears. I think if you are a fan of Mad Men, Breaking Bad, and Six Feet Under, you will like this show.",1403913600,,733,4.357664233576642

The viewer is now on a journey that filled me with empathy for all the characters involved and affected by the crime. The accused murderer, his family and extended family, and countless other members of a small town. If you enjoy thought provoking films without gore and unneccessary nudity watch this film. It's a taunt mystery, a character study. Great acting. The pace isn't fast but mournful as one feels when pallbearer's march past. Inevitable. Others who commented say the end is open ended. This point of view will leave some viewers feeling dissatisfied. If you don't seek depth and enlightenment in film, don't watch this film. If you don't want to be left pondering the characters and the nature of humanity and punishment and redemption, this is not the film for you. But if you'd like to watch a unique film that surprised me in every single episode...watch this quiet series. Kudos to Sundance. Bravo!",1402272000,,1012,4.82183908045977

Rectify is an outstanding show with the right blend of curiosity and American life. Not all characters come as well groomed as the protagonist, his sister in the show for instance is a very jumbled up character but he makes her believable.

It will be incorrect to assume the show is based on crime, no sir, it is not so simple. It is a moving drama with telling screenplay and a town that has turned against one man.

If any of you watched ""the hunt"" (movie) , you will love this show.
If any of you liked ""Rectify"" , you will love the hunt and pray I live longer.

Anyway, a lot of good things coming up, I am geared up and excited for the season 2. Should I watch the last few episodes again? I can't wait for things to take off.

Please watch rectify because I just told you who likeable the protagonist is. Good luck.",1401667200,,1051,4.157635467980295

5685711,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"I came across this show by accident while browsing on Amazon prime T.V. and was blown away by both its intriguing subject matter and the quality of acting.  The story of Daniel, a man who spent 19 years on death row only to be released by DNA evidence, is heart wrenching to watch and it repulses you to see the past and current malicious injustice at the hands of ignorant people. The actor portraying Daniel is superb and he compels you to keep watching as Daniel himself tries to come to grips with his own belief  as to his innocence.

The writers portray the horrific day to day living on death row that make  you question the whole subject of the death penalty as it appears grossly inhumane.

I cannot wait for Season 2.",1395360000,2,727,4.395522388059701

5685734,4,B00C1LIZMQ,"I found out about this Sundance Channel series (only 6 2013) via an actor who was auditioning for the second season. I'm ever so grateful. Ray McKinnon has been a favorite of mine since his role as the preacher on Deadwood. His slow and deliberate reveal of the characters in Rectify are riveting. No car chases or adrenaline pumping special effects here. It's a deep dive into the complexities of the spirit: the light and the shadow.

I didn't give it 5 stars because if I was producing it, I would have done some things differently. However, it's a contemporary television series that embraces American family and US institutions with all of its archetypal interweaving with the rest of the planet's humanity. And Rectify pulls the viewer into the drama and the wonder at how circumstances can forever define a life.",1391990400,,819,4.808510638297872

5685737,3,B00C1LIZMQ,"This 6 episode series about a man released by a DNA test after 19 years on death row for the supposed murder of his high school girlfriend is harrowing and really depressing. The Southern town's menacing and unforgiving claustrophobia combines with the central character's dazed, but thoughtful, search to find his way back from decades of sensory / life in a prison cell deprivation to create an unusual tv experience. Produced by the same folks who brought us the great Breaking Bad, this harrowing little effort abruptly delivers the exact opposite of a Hollywood happy ending: no redemption (but for the loving if bewildered support of a few family members), no justice achieved, nothing to feel good about.

Take it from someone who is difficult to ""get to"" when it comes to mainstream American series....i usually wind up watching BBC or Sundance..although the History channel did a great job with ""Vikings"" this year. Yay!~~Ur gonna LOVEEEEEEEE this...Open ur mind..toughen up..be shocked...be touched...become involved in these characters that so well represent us as people and FEEL things....U won't b disappointed....I wish for more like this from SUNDANCE..and cant wait to explore the world of David in season two.
P.S.~~ think of me when u see the part, where his sister(WHATS WITH HOT LEATHER BOOTS<AND A SUNDRESS<IN 120 DEGREE WEATHER<ANYWAY?)is knocking on his bedroom door,wondering whats going on....AND the episode with the coffee grounds !!!!! You'll never look at them the same way again. Perfect!....Love the mother character..she really doesnt know what the hell to do or think..that would be me.

But it's an amazing examination of the psychological adaptations a man might make to keep himself sane through decades of brutality and isolation, as well as the effects on a small town of the return of an assumed killer.  The acting, direction, and cinematography are excellent.

However, the writing is terrible, because I did not enjoy the time I spent watching the first two episodes, and there is absolutely nothing I look forward to seeing in future episodes.  The creators of the show seem to not understand that it is supposed to be entertainment.  There is nothing entertaining in a bunch of people in unhappy situations being unhappy.  I did like the Daniel character, but there was nothing but pain in his future.  His step brother is a total jerk, and I'm sure there will be lots of unhappiness as they clash.  I think that many say they like this show because it is so 'real' and 'deep'.  But it really isn't.  It is just writers who think that depressing and hopelessness = meaning.  Yuck - terrible show.

5685790,4,B00C1LIZMQ,"I loved the writing and directing on this show. The actors were each fresh and perfect, well-drawn and well-acted.
The slow pace of many speeches worked so well and I was riveted.

But I found myself angry afterwards. First, because of the completely ragged ending. There is no precedent for such an incomplete ending except and unless there is a promised next season to continue it with.

Inside the six-episode story there is a frustrating amorphosity to each of the key story nodes. Is the man guilty? Why not say. Why does the prosecutor demand proof that the man is innocent -- isn't he innocent until she proves him guilty? Who is the man with the figurine-dusting mother? What will be the effects of his throwing the body of the 'witness' into the river? Who are all the masked men who beat up the prisoner? Why do they all have it in for him? Surely they can't all have raped and murdered the 16-year old girl?

The seriously withholding mystery of the piece is frustrating and, I think, unnecessary. The story of the experiences of a man who has been in solitary confinement is extremely valuable and well-done. Especially this is important in light of the real stories of the 'SHUs' in California.  So why confound this valuable explication with unclear, fuzzy facts? Give me more. Don't send up a smokescreen in front of a terribly excruciatingly, otherwise beautiful, movie.",1377907200,2,1386,4.7625

5685797,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"This series is working on two levels: an engrossing character study that delves into the psychological effects years in prison-and shocking release-has on a person...and as an old-school gothic murder mystery. Who killed Hannah? Was it Daniel, recently released from death row due to DNA evidence? Or is someone else responsible? The ""multiple"" DNA samples taken from Hannah don't match Daniel...but they're sure going to match someone. Was Hannah raped? And if so, is the rapist-or rapists-the killer? The show takes it time setting up each possibility, giving the audience room to draw their own conclusions. But while the mystery simmers in the background, front and center is the damage this crime has wrought upon everyone, from Daniel himself to the community at large. Each character is drawn carefully, even the seemingly minor ones. Everyone's reaction to Daniel's release is explored, some interactions so subtle you might miss them, others with the intensity of a sonic boom.  Just beneath the surface of the most tranquil scene is the constant possibility of explosion. It is this atmosphere that gives this series its edge.

All the performances are excellent, but a few of the standouts are Adien Young as Daniel, Abigail Spencer as Daniel's hard-charging sister Amantha, and Luke Kirby as Jon Stern, the new lawyer on the case. I was also really impressed with Johnny Ray Gill as Kerwin, Danie's BFF on death row.

5685841,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"This is what great TV is about! This ""mini-series"" (it's just 6 episodes of about 45 minutes each) appeared on the premium Sundance Channel on cable so most folks will discover it - as I did - on DVD (or streaming video). I went into it knowing only that it was a story of a 36 year old man ""readjusting"" after a 20 year prison term when new DNA evidence shows that he might be innocent.  And that's all you need to know. (No spoiler alert from me!). With its short (for a series) time length you can, and should, watch it over a two night (or day) span. It works best that way.

This is a story about the ""south"". It takes place in a Georgia town and the prejudices that exist. Some of the caricatures are a bit stock but the acting makes up for it. You can tell it's a cable show when the director feels the need to show a character relieving herself in the bathroom (a scene which, frankly, adds nothing to it except to say ""this is not broadcast TV, we can show things like this""). But that certainly doesn't change my five star rating or recommendation.

The DVD comes with five ""bonus features"" such as ""Meet the Cast"", ""Behind the Screen"" and a ""Sundance on Set"" featurette.

Unlike the longer cable series on DVD (like ""The Wire"", ""Breaking Bad"", etc. You don't need to set aside weeks to watch this first season. Just a little under five hours will do it.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5685846,4,B00C1LIZMQ,"There is so much to like about RECTIFY, the new one-hour dramatic series that premiered on The Sundance Channel in April.  The actors are, without exception, superb.  The dialogue and individual scenes are absorbing.  The location filming in rural Georgia is striking.

The story revolves around Daniel Holden (Aden Young), who has spent the past twenty years on death row for the rape and murder of his girl friend.  Now, because of newly found DNA evidence, his sentence has been vacated; yet officials and residents of the small town in which he grew up, including members of his own family, still believe him to be guilty.

Having been incarcerated since he was nineteen, Holden has problems adjusting to the outside world.  His future is also in question, since the current local district attorney, hard-pressed by her predecessor (Michael O'Neill), now a state senator, is trying to build a new case against Daniel.

My problem with this series is that, as compelling as the story might be, it would have been better told as a two-hour movie, rather than in these six one-hour episodes that do not give us a conclusion to the mystery (i.e. who killed the girl twenty years ago?).  As a result, the episodes move at a ponderous pace and the season ends with nothing being resolved.  (I assume that the series will return for a second season, though at this writing, a sophomore season is not listed on imdb.)

Story-wise, I think that the producers could have put the mystery to rest in this first season, then dealt more with Daniel's adjustment problems in any subsequent seasons.  By not doing that, they take the chance of angering and losing their audience, as was the case with THE KILLING when that show did not reveal the murderer at the end of the freshman season.  When their second season aired, many viewers (including this writer) no longer watched the show.  They had simply ceased to care.

Created and written by actor Ray McKinnon, the cast of RECTIFY includes Abigail Spencer, J. Smith-Cameron, Luke Kirby, Clayne Crawford and Adelaide Clemens.

DVD extras on the two-disc set from Anchor Bay Entertainment consist of several ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.

Although his guilt or innocence remains unclear, the whodunit of it is beside the point.  How he is to fit into any life and how we all fit together (or don't) is the show's concern.  This slow burn series is thought provoking, nuanced, delicate and what I believe to be the best writing on T.V. ever.  It is insightful to the human condition, hyper aware of the convenience, artifice, and convoluted nature of our modern life and the books and writing it mentions alone make it worth the watch.  It gives you the gift of varied viewpoints with mirrors as well as pictures and I believe the actors are all doing their very best.  Unlike a show like Mad Men (which I like) it doesn't try so hard to make you think, it coaxes you there, you want to rise to the material.

Not always easy to watch, due to subject matter, but still, THE most sensitive portrayal of the experience of being (provisionally) released from a a very long time in prison (death row) that I have ever seen far and away.

It is also incredible proof that you CAN have a slow-moving (tho, not always so slow!), character-driven story that is utterly riveting. Aden Young as the lead is beautiful -- mysterious, moving, slightly ominous, beautiful.  He makes the unimaginable experience somehow real.  He gives us a window into what it would be like in a way that I have simply never seen portrayed before -- the minutia of what he goes thru in this half alien/half remembered world is so palpable.

All the actors are great.  And Ray McKinnon's writing and directing are something that should not be missed.  If you know Ray McKinnon as an actor, particularly from Deadwood, his writing here will be of particular interest, as there are some fascinating Deadwood echoes.  But even if you've never heard of Deadwood, RECTIFY is something that should be experienced.  A second season of 10 episodes will be made and aired in 2014.  Buying these first six episodes for under $10, if you've missed them on television, is an easy way to catch up.",1368403200,2,1381,4.6887966804979255

5685906,5,B00C1LIZMQ,One of the best first seasons of a show ever. I only wish the season was 10 episodes instead of 6. It plays out with the grace of a great southern novel.  Terrific performances by all. The scenes between Daniel (Aden Young) and Tawney (Adelaide Clemens) are especially poignant.  Couldn't recommend this enough.,1367712000,,311,4.849056603773585

5685911,5,B00C1LIZMQ,can't wait for season 2...be prepared for raw drama. All the characters are well developed. This show is not for the tender hearted. But something we need to address. Prejudice is nothing but hate.,1367539200,,197,4.823529411764706
5685912,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"""Rectify"" is a fine show which takes its time to establish characters and its story line.  Characters are multi-dimensial and the writers (and lead actor) are not afraid to have a lead character who is not always wholly likable.  A friend whose son was incarcerated for a long period tells me that the behavior of the man who is freed from prison is absolutely spot on in his slow adaptation to freedom and his desire to revisit music and diversions that were popular or which he liked when he was jailed, rather than rushing to see what new things have come about.  ""Rectify"" is the equal of the best HBO, Showtime, AMC and Starz dramas.",1367539200,4,638,4.530434782608696
5685913,5,B00C1LIZMQ,I have watched three episodes of Rectify and have encouraged others to catch up on the website.  The actions/reactions of  Daniel and the family and the townspeople seem so spot on it is as if I am watching a documentary - a fascinating one.  It is slow-moving and rather dark but balanced by the hopeful younger sister and brother who try so hard and seem to be reaching him.  Interesting development between the sister-in-law and Daniel and I imagine that will draw some fireworks soon.  Mom is clueless; she needs to cut down a Valium or two.  All in all the premise for the story is original and I have no idea which way it will go:  I can only hope and keep watching.,1367452800,,672,4.370967741935484
5685914,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"Brilliant adaptation of this classic allegory expertly written and acted - especially the lead actor playing Daniel. As intelligent as breaking bad , Rubicon, or the killing",1367452800,3,173,5.444444444444445
5685915,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"This is my first ever Amazon review, although I have purchased many books and movies. I caught the first two episodes of this show, and was so hooked, today I purchased the full season and watched the whole thing. I don't know how to describe it other than it is a show tha fully engaged my intellect and emotions. There are times when I've had to shut one or the other off in order to enjoy something, but that was not the case here.

Rectify is a powerful story. I am a die hard fan of LOST, Breaking Bad, the Walking Dead, to give you an idea of how my tastes trend. I love story, but I love me some action too. In this case, I was forced as a viewer to inhabit a world that was unfamiliar and uncomfortable, yet not necessarily--and i will now argue that it's not--""action packed."" the action is all of an emotional and abstract nature, such as we are not often allowed to enjoy with most filmmaking today.

this is one of the few shows i could not predict what would happen next. But it never became unbelievable. That is the power I have found with shows such as Breaking Bad. Even in the most fantastical episode, we are given such everyday human details, that I'm not allowed to sit as a bystander. That is the kind of filmmaking (IMHO) at its best.

An example: at one point, Daniel's mother is faced with an uncomfortable truth. She goes to lie down, and her step son finds her laying on the bed. She was clutching her purse. That small detail--that overwhelmed southern woman holding on to her pocket book as she lies down because she can't take anymore--that is such a small easily overlooked human detail that immediately grounds the viewer in the story.

I am rambling, and about to go in for a second viewing of the whole 6 episodes. I am PRAYING that they do not stop at 6, and let us continue to follow the story. Give it a chance everyone--you won't be sorry.",1367280000,14,1877,4.323863636363637
5685916,3,B00C1LIZMQ,"The actors are amazing and Daniel's speeches are fantastic and deep.

But the walls of the prison are crystal clean white, the linens in jail look new, etc. Just too nice physically for prisons. Then the tired cliche of prison rape when everyone remotely experienced with prisoners knows that is not the problem- being isolated is. Then Daniel wants to get back to all technology etc of 19 years ago when a real released prisoner wants to catch up on modern times asap.

Cleaver's Soul on Ice was a better depiction of prison.",1367193600,,526,4.645161290322581
5685917,1,B00C1LIZMQ,"I was very intrigued about this as it's Sundance Channel and the makers of Breaking Bad offering a new show, but was very disappointed. It should be a case study in what is weak about today's movie/television offerings, especially cable offerings.
First, the main character doesn't quite line up. He's getting out of prison after spending half his life on death row. But when he gives a press conference, he's so inciteful about his state of mind--you can see the writers at work, crafting this speech. But when he comes out and relates to his family, he's like an animatron, almost reminding me of Jeff Bridges' performance as Starman--odd, one word answers and two word sentences. In prison, he's chanting and meditating and reading scads of books, outside he's a dumb southerner, no brighter than a stump.
They don't give him a love interest yet, but give him a sister, who, because she is southern, wears a dress with cowboy boots EVERY day. The sister acts like she's so concerned about her brother it hurts, but can't have a normal conversation with him.
He's accused of raping and killing a teenage girl (yawn--Twin Peaks, who killed Rosie somebody) and maybe he did it and maybe he didn't, but apparently every law enforcement officer AND a senator just CAN'T abide him being free. Don't know if he's ACTUALLY guilty, but can't abide him being free and have nothing better to do ALL DAY LONG than obsess about this one criminal who may or may not be guilty. Seriously, this is going to carry a series? (they're also flinging the episodes at you fast and furiously, I guess so they can get the whole series budget before they are cancelled midway)
Need a shorter review: GRATUITOUS. DEGRADING. SPOON FED. and BAD SOUNDTRACK.
Like too many 'cable' flavored series that COULD be really good, they fall back on Gratuitous Sex. In two hours, we learn almost nothing about the main character but we get one doggie style (literally) scene, one ""let me give you a blow job cause I just took a piss and it turned me on somehow"" scene (with a pervy motel janitor looking through the window), one prisoner masturbating onto his cell door, one husband making his shy wife stand naked so he could look at her, then have sex with her so boring she looked like she'd rather be reading a magazine and the FINAL scene of the pilot: Main Character masturbates to a magazine that his brother-in-law bought for him to welcome him to the outside world while his sister hears him through the door, then creeps away after he was aware she was there. If THIS is what you've been saving the popcorn for, bring it on. Sorry I gave the whole thing away, but just trying to save you from wasting 2 hours of your life you will never get back waiting patiently through scenes that made me want to bathe to try to get a smidgen of drama. Didn't happen.",1367193600,24,2829,4.603960396039604
8576233,5,B00C1LIZMQ,"In all the years I have seen American filmmaking and television lurch towards the lowest common denominator,there are always one or two shows which reach for the heavens and leave the dross behind.
There is no doubt that this is an American masterpiece,
From the time of D.W. Griffiths,there are very few films or series which can reach the sublimity of this.
The story line is portrayed in an achingly beautiful way by the sublime casting from all the actors.
To single one out from another would be unfair and artistically invalid.
'Rectify' works on many intellectual,artistic and religious levels.
I can't wait to absorb what I can from it and then watch it again and again.
The only other series I can watch like this is the English series 'Life on Mars'.
