5008440,5,B006O2BTGW,I think this movie is an inspiration for families and young children who truly believe. I enjoyed this movie and it's title is perfect and special.,1339200000,,147,4.6923076923076925
5008441,5,B006O2BTGW,An encouraging movie - fun to watch.  My entire family (including my kids) enjoyed it. Erica Gluck did a marvelous job.,1337817600,,119,4.666666666666667
5008442,5,B006O2BTGW,"This was a must see family movie. It is so moving and speaks on interracial relationship and how the families react to them. It's about love that despite the odds they still loved each other enough to have a beautiful baby girl. it will make you laugh and cry, it brings a broken family back together. Just a great movie for all to see.",1337644800,,336,4.265625
5008443,4,B006O2BTGW,This was a nice story of nontraditional family.  It was nice to watch with the children. It kinda puts your family value and relationship issue into prospective.,1337126400,,161,4.962962962962963
5008444,3,B006O2BTGW,It was nice to see and something to watch this movie had the potential to be good but could have been better....Eric Benet playing a father.....oh please. Other than that it was like a Hallmark movie to me.,1336521600,,206,4.447368421052632
5008445,4,B006O2BTGW,"My family and I watched this together. We have a 15 year old and an 8 year old. We all loved the movie; especially the girls. My husband and I were blown away by Eric Benet's natural talent on screen (we're already big fans of his music). We both thought that most of the movie budget must have been spent on Eric Benet and James Hong as the rest of the actor's (outside of an impressive Erica Gluck)performances were sub-par. At any rate, we loved the movie. The girls have already watched it for a second time.",1335139200,3,512,4.288659793814433
5008446,4,B006O2BTGW,"Got this movie for my 9 year old daughter, but although she did like it, she was a little bored in parts. I wish they would have kept more of the Spirituality in it like the play. It was a nice movie for the family but I think my husband and I enjoyed it just a little more than our daughter. The young girl is a wonderful actress! All this said...my daughter did watch it a second time a couple days later so it must have caught her interest!",1334880000,,443,3.9887640449438204
5008447,4,B006O2BTGW,"Much of the credit for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trinity-Goodheart/dp/B006O2BTGW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trinity Goodheart</a>, success must be attributed to the chemistry generated between its talented co-stars, Erica Gluck and Eric Benet, given that the story primarily revolves around their characters' dysfunctional father-daughter relationship. Though an original production by the Gospel Music Channel Network, the film only hints at a faith-based agenda via light touches such as Trinity's name and lines like, ""Don't forget to say your prayers.""

A present-day parable delivering a powerful reminder that much wisdom often still comes from the mouths of babes.  Read the full review written by Kam Williams for AALBC.com at [...]",1330646400,2,789,6.7254901960784315

A wonderful ensemble cast with a shining star in the emotive and adorable Erica Gluck.  Trinity Goodheart is aptly named and the  movie makes you smile  from beginning to end.

5008464,5,B006O2BTGW,"What a sweet movie and a precious plot. As adults we see kids argue, and we tell them to kiss and make up.
That does not apply to adults though, pretty immature how adults can hand out advice but they don't take advice, or practice what they preach. Thats precisely what I got out of this movie.
I thought the point of this movie was well pointed out and well scripted into a beautiful movie.",1388448000,,392,4.24
5008465,4,B006O2BTGW,"Did not have deep spiritual message as I expected, but really showed how a child with faith can mend broken families, and really make a difference.  Also showed how divided a family can be over different cultural values, especially those involving finance. This is something many families including mine can relate to.",1382745600,,318,5.115384615384615
5008466,5,B006O2BTGW,"I love this movie Eric and Erica do such a good job. This is a movie of battle and struggles, and how it can take years to get past the past or to atleast accept things you can not change. How this little girl change the thoughts and lives of four adults was powerful. I need to order another copy because my daughter step on it but I will buy it again. This a definitely a good addition to any ones movie library.",1382140800,,414,4.0

5008468,5,B006O2BTGW,"In a time when finding good, clean, wholesome, family related movies are hard to locate, look no further when it comes to ""Trinity Goodheart.""  What a movie!!!!!!!!  I really can't quite put it into words how awesome this movie is, but hopefully wih me giving it a Five Star rating, each person who sees the stars and reads the reviews will know they've picked the right one.  Get the movie, you'll be sooooooo glad you did.  I highly recommend this movie for the ENTIRE family to see!",1379894400,,485,4.540229885057471
5008469,5,B006O2BTGW,it was very touching.hit real life issues that go on today in society. the father daughter relationship is portrayed greatly for an African American male. that's the relationship I have with my father and my daughters have with my husband.,1374883200,,239,5.0
5008470,5,B006O2BTGW,Trinity Goodheart was so moving. It was kind of sad when she found out that her mother was no longer living. But this dvd was a gift to two special people in my life and they just loved it. I've watched it on several times and purchased it from amazon.com for husband and wife friend of mine. I'm going to purchase one for my home to just watch it over a over again.,1373500800,,366,4.027397260273973
5008471,4,B006O2BTGW,"Very good movie. Usually I don't like movies with death involed, but even though there was death it still turn out to be very good movie.",1369008000,,137,4.3076923076923075
5008472,5,B006O2BTGW,"I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas.  She loved the movie.  This was a movie that I could be okay with her watching without my supervision.  There are many references to god, and angels.  This an especially good movie for the holidays.",1361836800,,249,4.590909090909091
5008473,2,B006O2BTGW,"The plot is slow moving and often boring.
The acting is not great, especially the young girl, who is the heroine.
The ending is happy, with relationships resolved, but the rest of the film didn't hold my attention.
I don't recommend buying this film.",1360108800,,250,4.704545454545454

5008475,5,B006O2BTGW,"This was just such a nice little feel-good movie.  Bi-racial Trinity, age 12 believes in angels.  She is such a sweet young lady and is always making little angels to put in her friend's store.  Trinity lives alone with her dad.  Mom was white and dad is black, so there was some family friction.  Now, Mom is gone and nobody is speaking to nobody!  An angel visits Trinity with half a locket, encouraging her to find the other half, and reconnect her family. So, she sets out to try.",1347062400,,484,4.382022471910112

8501545,5,B006O2BTGW,"What I liked most about this movie was the Fathers ""out of the box"" principles that will and do allow, his daughter to be her best self. This 12 year old girl, Trinity, believes in angels and believes to have been visited by one then awakens to find herself holding one half of her mothers long lost broken in half necklace. She then, after hearing the story of why her mom is not in the picture, seeks to find her grandparents to get everyone together to find her. This part is hilarious.  After the other half appears, she is even more convinced this is a sign to bring this broken and conflicted family back together and go find the mom: However the same attitudes of the broken hearted grandparents are still in place. After an argument involving both sets of grandparents,Trinity runs away and tries to find her mom herself. Along the way a surprising helper appears. This movie is full of fun, light hearted moments and shared truths that really can inspire all of us to open our eyes and really see what matters with family. I believe the script was well written, the casting is wonderful. The music is amazing. Eric Benet and Kellin Watson are two of the actors but are also singers who bless this wonderful story with their own music for a great soundtrack. Please do not miss this sweet story that is, in my opinion, a great family movie. I loved the diversity in this movie. There is really not anything I disliked except at the end, I cried. Again, I encourage families that want a good, clean movie to enjoy together to sit down, get some popcorn or ice cream and an open mind, and just enjoy this gem. You will leave it with good ""feels"". Enjoy!!!",1515801600,,1661,4.463815789473684

8501548,3,B006O2BTGW,"This movie was a real tear jerker. It was very moving. The overall message of the movie was delivered. However I did not like how Trinity Goodheart was portrayed. She was too controlling, naive, sassy and frankly, a very unbelievable character. The movie also had some very unthought out details. Trinity Goodheart was not a good main character at all.",1491004800,,352,4.883333333333334
