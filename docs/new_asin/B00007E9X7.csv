7975367,2,B00007E9X7,"I absolutely love this video.  The exercises really work your muscles, and the added squats/lunges really make a difference.  I have been working out with weights for years, and have seen better results with these, and less irritation to my joints (particularly my wrists).  The music and instruction are non-obtrusive and so is the instruction, so you won't get irritated, which is nice.  However, the bands themselves STINK!  The bands can be interchanged with handles, but they slip out of the handles CONSTANTLY.  I actually had one snap out and crack me pretty hard on my back, leaving a huge red welt.  Also, the bands cannot be interchanged quickly, so you have to stop your workout to do that and it brings your workout to a complete stop.  I therefore purchased new bands that are easier to work with and interchange faster (from Amazon, called ""Exercise bands super system by Bodylastics - Basic tension""), and it comes with it's own video which is okay...I think this video is better for a quick but thorough workout (it lasts about 20-25 minutes).",1110412800,13,1059,4.844444444444444
