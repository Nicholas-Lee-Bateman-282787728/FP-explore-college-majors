8747276,5,B01AGOTOZG,"Classic Films and great transfers. These films present an amazing combination of yakuza violence, romance and melodrama. The first one, that is directed by Toshio Masuda is considered the best in the series, but i did not like it as much as the following two, which i think are much better films and more enjoyable with that brilliant combination mentioned above. Arrow is doing a really Great gob and i hope that they will continue releasing many more films by Norifumi Suzuki, Teruo Ishii and Yukio Noda, that are still not available.",1480896000,,536,4.836956521739131
8747277,5,B01AGOTOZG,"Possibly one of the best Complete Collections to come to Blu-ray. Arrow Video has an amazing job adding all these together in one complete product. I was super happy to be able to experience these films. Arrow Video has done a major justice in bringing this set to Blu-ray, to be able to experience this crime, action series.

The first was Outlaw Gangster VIP followed by 5 sequels. The whole series is amazing and is one of those series that lingers and stays with you. Its a jam packed production. Your main character is Goro, played flawlessly by Tetsuya Watari. Goro is a gangster who was sent to prison after stabbing a hitman who just happened to be apart of another gang that are rivals. This gang is known as Aokis. Out of prison he sees that his gang is falling apart, and the hitman he tried to kill, just happens to still be alive.

The star is Tetsuya Watari. A fantastic actor that is able to express a believable reality to his characters. He is one of those actors I feel never got the house hold name of popularity that he deserved. Watching him in Gangster VIP and the sequels, one cant help but become a part of his style, personality, and over all acting expertise. Started acting in 1965 and continued to act all the way up to 2013. He also starred in another favorite of mine 1966s Tokyo Drifter.

In Gangster VIP 2 Goro is trying to move forward, away from his darkened past. This one is thick with drama and more character development then the first one. As before in Gangster VIP, Tetsuya Watari captures the character in a flawless way through a wonderful dramatic and dark performance. In the third film Heartless our Anti style hero is at it again in this action thriller. Heartless I feel is the lessor of the films. Not entirely sure where I would rank this one in the context of rating chart. Dont get me wrong its not a bad film and I did thoroughly enjoy all the characters who are fleshed out in amazing detail. This time around Goro is after Sawada, a gambler who happens to owe 3 million yen to Goros employer, and as you would guess, Goro is coming to collect. In the 4th movie, Goro the Assassin is about to be released from prison when his partner in crime Masahiko is dying. On his death bed he gives Goro one last order to find his sister, and to take care of her. Out of jail, he decides to follow the mission in finding the sister, but soon like in all crime thriller reality, Goro finds himself yet again in an ordeal that only crime, violence can solve. In the 5th instalment Black Dagger there is a street war happening, two separate gangs are going at it. And as you would guess it, Goro is smack in the middle. The 6th and final film in the awesome Gangster VIP series is titled Kill! and came out in 1969. This time as you would expect, Goro comes to town and yes like in Gangster VIP reality, he finds himself in the troubles. Goro helps out a young woman who is being tormented by a group of Yakuza thugs.

The first one was directed by one of the finest Japanese film directors to ever grace cinema. Toshio Masuda. Masuda who is still alive as of this writing, created so many wonderful box office winners. I think he is one of those director's and visionaries that should be expressed and remembered. He directed the Japanese parts of the classic war film 1970s Tora! Tora! Tora! Also the great 1958s Rusty Knife, just a few I want to mention. Parts 2, 4, 5 and 6 was directed by another fantastic Japanese film director. Keiichi Ozawa. Ozawa directed another favorite of mine 1971s The Hunted Samurai. The 3rd Outlaw VIP Heartless was directed by Mio Ezaki. Another Japanese director that I feel is worthy to praise and remember. That is what is so great about this series is the direction is solid, there are a few moments that I could pin point that doesnt work, but in the end the conclusion of the series I feel works. The 1st one is always the better one, but each of other parts, I feel still work.

These are a wonderful collection of Crime thrillers. Each one I feel has its merit to be remembered. Gangsters and crime has always been a fascination with movie makers and movie watchers. I think the Outlaw Gangster series is one those worthy collections to talk about, remember and express to others. Arrow Video has honored this series with a must own Blu-ray collection.

8747278,4,B01AGOTOZG,"So far rather little-known in the West, the Outlaw-movies were among the very first Yakuza back in the 1960's that refused to romanticize gangsterdom and instead concentrated on broken men (first and foremost the series' lead character Goro) unable to escape the malstrom of murder and crime they have once foolishly adopted as their lifestyle and that has now cost them everything they have ever loved. And fascinating movies they are, too!",1465344000,2,441,5.138888888888889

8747281,5,B01AGOTOZG,"*I received a review copy of this collection in exchange for an honest review

I have to confess Id never heard of these Yakuza flicks until I got ahold of this collection.  For some reason (probably because of my fondness for horror), I just never had an interest in the older mob films.  But, man, I sure wish Id been told about them before.  These films are dark and gritty, and they supposedly paint a more realistic portrait of what life in the organization was like back in the 50s and 60s.  If you are new to the OUTLAW: GANGSTER films like me, then you're in for a real treat.

I enjoyed every movie in this collection, and I am proud to have it in my library.  Each film is masterfully done, and each has merits making it a worthy addition to the franchise.

Part of what makes this collection so great is that the films flow together so well, despite the different directors involved.  While each looks great in its own regard, theres no huge discernable differences between the productions of each.  As a result, the film set has cohesion and substance, two attributes lacking in many of the franchises of today.

The films in the OUTLAW: GANGSTER VIP COLLECTION look excellent onscreen.  The HD transfers give the picture a bold look, and theres only a few grainy shots here and there (particularly in the opening credit sequences, when the Nikkatsu logo appears).  This does not detract from the film experience at all, thankfully.

The acting in each film is great, with Tetsuya Watari portraying Goro, the main character.  I had no trouble believing in the roles portrayed in each film, and Watari does a great job of maintaining his character throughout the sextet.

My favorite film of the OUTLAW: GANGSTER VIP COLLECTION is probably the first one, simply titled OUTLAW: GANGSTER VIP.  The stark realism presented is a nice contrast to the over-the-top action films of today, and I found the whole movie immersive.  I particularly like how Goro is represented as an actual human being with emotions, instead of an unfeeling, robotic killer, as seen in many other gangster/Yakuza films.

The OUTLAW: GANGSTER VIP COLLECTION is a big win for me, and I suggest giving it a look if you like mobster films.  Granted, the films in this set are dated, but that doesnt detract from the entertainment value at all.",1462838400,4,2322,4.7004950495049505
8747282,5,B01AGOTOZG,"Arrow's Outlaw: Gangster VIP Collection is the sort of box set you don't see many companies taking a chance on these days.  A relatively unknown series of youth / yakuza films cranked out in quick succession by Nikkatsu studios in 1968, all six films are presented together for the first time in the west, introducing us to Goro the Assassin (Tetsuya Watari), a gangster with a heart of gold whose wanderings inevitably end up in entanglements of the violent and romantic kind.

All six films are ridiculously interchangeable, with every actor except Watari swapping roles from installment to installment.  The format is as follows:  Goro, an ex-yakuza running from his past, winds up rescuing a love interest (or old friend) from the clutches of some rival clan.  With the best of intentions, our anti-hero is forced to draw his blade and mow down an army of underlings before facing off against the top dog...only to stagger away in a hollow victory.

The repetitive nature of each film doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Chieko Matsubara plays a different love interest with a different name every time - and actually doubles-down in Black Dagger by dying in the first scene only to reappear as a look-alike five minutes later!  But like a Shakespearean troupe on tour, there's an enjoyable twist to each repeat performance and one begins to appreciate the small deviations in character from one film to the next.

But make no mistake; it's Watari's screen presence as Goro, the tenderhearted tough-guy, that anchors the series.  With his leather jacket, tight pants and perpetual pout, the connection to western pop idols like Elvis is intentional and oh-so effective.  Only instead of a guitar, Goro's favorite instrument in his yakuza blade:  3-inches of polished steel that usually winds up buried in someone's belly.  The violence, when it comes, is quick and chaotic; like a rugby scrum interrupting a dry run of West Side Story.  But it's always tempered with tears, as Goro's weeps (quite often) for not only his fallen comrades but also his own wasted life.

The Outlaw films are a fairly ingenious mix of gangster mayhem and teenage melodrama.  What they lack in variety they make up with attitude.  And having all six films (Gangster VIP, Gangster VIP 2, Heartless, Goro the Assassin, Black Dagger and Kill!) right from the get-go is just the sort of move than endears fans to a new discovery.

The hi-def transfers are spot-on with the elements getting a little cleaner on each subsequent film (standard-def discs are included as well).  Extras start off with original trailers and still galleries along with an audio commentary on the first film, liner notes and a 40-minute ""visual essay"" that covers the series from start to finish.  Another limited edition of only 3000 copies, this one is a safe bet to sell-out.  And, yes, you will regret not buying it.",1459900800,18,2875,4.898760330578512

The Japanese Underworld

Amos Lassen

The Outlaw Gangster VIP collection contains six movies, Gangster VIP 1 & 2, Heartless, Goro the Assassin, Black Dagger, and Kill!. Through these films, directed by Toshio Masuda, we get a depiction of the Japanese underworld that was unprecedented in its realism and its sympathetic portrayal of its protagonist as a man haunted by his past, unable to escape a life of crime. The success of the initial installment spawned five sequels, continuing the story of Slasher Goro and his quest for redemption.

The film stars Tetsuya Wateri as Goro, a gangster who was sent to prison for three years for stabbing the hitman of a the rival gang called the Aokis. On his release from prison, Goro finds out his gang in decline and learns that the hitman he stabbed is still alive.

Outlaw: Gangster VIP is based on the writings of Goro Fujita, an ex-gangster who wrote the novel the film was based on.[1] The film was the first in a six part series of films based on Goro Fujitas character.

The films presented a new kind of realism and violence and provide us with a unique and unforgettable viewing experience.
