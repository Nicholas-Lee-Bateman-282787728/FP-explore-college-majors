711087,5,6303686788,"After not expecting movies like ""Krull"" on DVD, here comes more good news. ""Spacehunter"" is coming to DVD on December 4!
(Same day as the first Babylon 5 disc)
Spacehunter will get the basic Columbia/Tristar DVD treatment:
16x9 widescreen and Pan&scan, trailer, cast, crew and production
notes, sound format still unknown(I don't know if they released
it in a multi-channel format in 1984, but i'm guessing Dolby 4.0 or 4.1,but i'm basing this on another film on DVD from this time
""Runaway"" with Tom Selleck. At the very least we will get 2.0 mono or 2.0 stereo).
Thanks to DVDFile for the heads up!",1000684800,4,600,4.778846153846154
711088,5,6303686788,"Yes, that's right: five stars.  It's a five star B movie, and one of my favorites.  My dream is that some day they will figure out a way to release these old 3-D movies on DVD for home viewing.  But whether or not they get it in 3-D, I hope someday to see this on DVD.  ""Spacehunter"" is a total cheesefest, but brilliant in it's own way.  It's my favorite of all of the ""forbidden zone"" mutant type movies.  There are all sorts of strange deformed creatures running around that were created by a mad scientist.  The best part is Michael Ironside, who is awesome as the Overdog, who is the head mutant of this particular forbidden zone.  He runs a death maze the he feeds beautiful women into to see if they can survive.  Best line: ""I like her.  I like her for the maze!""  Check it out.",992476800,38,786,4.208053691275167

711155,4,6303686788,One of my favorite films of the early eighties! Cheesy good sci-fi fun when films used practical creative visual effects! Would've given a fifth star had the studio offered any extras on this disc! There are none,1504310400,,212,4.756756756756757

711211,3,6303686788,"I saw this in the theater in 3D when it came out.  We didn't  have much sci fii/fantasy in the theaters back then. I remember that, at the time, having the opportunity to see a movie in 3D was great fun. Later, I did purchase it on VHS. It's a  fun movie.  It is the first movie I remember seeing Molly Ringwald in.  I think I was in 8th grade when I saw this in the theater, so , please forgive me if this review is a bit sentimental. I think it is appropriate for young kids. I also remember seeing a review on TV that showed a spaceship landing on a planet, where you could freeze the frame and see a parking lot of cars behind the backdrop.  I Think that was on ET when it was still in the theater.  Still, this is a fun movie, especially for preteens.",1496102400,,756,3.966887417218543
711212,3,6303686788,"Although it is awesome this Sci-Fi Classic has finally made it to Blu-ray an otherwise 5 star rating has been downgraded to 3 for one sole reason...after all this waiting, and in the wake of every other 3D movies from the same theatrical release time (notably Metalstorm & Jaws 3D) being released on 3D Blu-ray recently, why the {deleted explicatives} was this released in 2D only? Especially considering I saw this originally in 3D in the theater {my Mother's compromise to a 10 yr old who had wanted to see Jaws 3D which was out simultaneously...been hooked ever since} it's frustrating, considering that using the 3D function of my player and/or TV will not do the movie justice when it's well known that both the Lt & Rt original film elements are in archive...

For the $10 price tag at least its worth checking out if you never have, and a most definite upgrade for fans.",1495929600,3,877,4.621794871794871
711213,5,6303686788,"After seen this movie again after so long I love it more than ever .  I remember it just being some goofy sci-fi movie on HBO, back when I was gobbling up anything sci-fi... but seeing it for sale on Blu-Ray made me feel all nostalgic so I snagged it.  Even though this was a pretty low-budget ""b"" movie, they obviously put money in other areas that count.  Though the special effects are merely passable, the acting is top notch, everyone is very well cast in their roles.  The writing is also excellent, dialogue is very snappy, clever and well-delivered by the actors.  As for the blu-ray, it's nice to have it in a widescreen format, but the print does show some flaws, and it would have been nice to have a 3-D version, since that's the way it was shown in theaters.  And there are no extras, not even a theatrical trailer.  Still its Great Saturday afternoon movie and I'm happy to have it.",1495670400,4,896,4.393939393939394

in the days before, great, CGI.
The transfer is a little rough... or maybe I just noticed the fuzziness because I watched it in my TV's simulated 3D
mode. The beginning of the movie----in it's Star Wars expanse of stars flight-path----looked pretty good.

This IS an '80s flick, so, there's extensive MINIATURE-effects.",1494028800,2,434,5.382352941176471

711265,1,6303686788,"No 3D, no interest. This was one of the most famous 3D sci fi titles of the 1980s. Releasing it without 3D is the same thing like releasing Gone With The Wind in black and white. And no, its no problem at all releasing it in 3D (cause there is no such magical thing as old and new full colour 3D. cause both simply work the same way: delivering seperated picturesd for both eyes in full colour. And bakc then the same polaroid process was used we are using today (only difference is circular polarization, but that doesnt change the seperation in any way)).

So release this 3D classic in the same way it was shown at the cinemas: in full colour 3D!!!",1492214400,5,651,4.2926829268292686

711323,1,6303686788,"Mill Creek Entertainment has been doing some great work lately, but I simply will not purchase a long-awaited Spacehunter Blu-ray if it is not a Blu-ray 3D.  I briefly considered taking the plunge and seeing how this looks on my TV's simulated 3D option, but no -- that won't cut it.  By no means a masterpiece, Spacehunter and its ilk nonetheless deserve home video releases true to their original theatrical exhibition.  That's the beauty of 3D TV -- that I can actually recreate a majority of that missed experience at home.  I can watch Creature from the Black Lagoon, House of Wax, Metalstrom, etc., and get a sense of the innovation and thrill of the era -- the only thing missing is the communality of audience reactions.  I figure that Mill Creek doesn't necessarily have the budget or resources available to make this a definitive 3D release like say, Shout! Factory would.  Hopefully protests like mine will convince them to revisit Spacehunter with a proper 3D release in the near future.",1489881600,10,999,4.812865497076023
711324,1,6303686788,"I would buy this in an instant if it were in 3D, but won't even take it for free in 2D. Spacehunter is a pretty bad movie anyways, I can only imagine how much worse it is without its main attribute.",1489795200,12,198,3.8536585365853657

711327,5,6303686788,"Awesome! Loved watching this again after so many years. The video quality was good, not sure if remastered but it played better and clearer than on any VHS I watched it on back in the past.  Molly Ringwald is so young and showing her chops already, and then the language, awesome, you can see the base root of so many languages in ski fi movies today.

Granted it doesn't have top notch anything and it is officially a B movie but that's what makes it so great, I LOVE B MOVIES! I'm also a huge Ghostbusters fan and I love all the Ghostbuster tie ins it has, it's produced by Ivan Reitman, stars Ernie Hudson, the voice on the intercom in the beginning of the movie talking to Captain Wolff is Harold Ramis and to finish it off the music is Elmer Bernstein! This movie just feels like home! So angry it never made it to Blu Ray but fortunately the DVD has pretty dang good picture and sound.

711515,4,6303686788,"This movie gets panned a lot because it's pretty schlocky, but for some reason I have a soft spot for this flick. The first quarter of the movie is probably the worst as far as special effects, plot, costumes, and dialog. But once you get past that, it takes on a certain charm, particularly Michael Ironside, who gives a wonderfully creepy performance.

I'd probably rent this again, probably not any time soon, but it's a movie I come back to once in a while. I saw it when it was first on HBO, and now, some 30 (yikes) years later, I still enjoy it. It's not for everyone, but if you like B sci-fi movies, then you might give this one a try.",1424476800,2,644,4.235772357723577

My appreciation of the talents of  Molly Ringwald was nothing until i saw this movie.  She's the equivalent of a post-apocalypse street-wise punk kid(MadMax style barren colony planet, with mutants).  Peter Strauss makes a great opposite, as the -i don't care about anything but the bounty, but i can't help but treat you like an annoying little sister i have to keep safe- .  It's well worth it.

You have cool characters for the most part, cool vehicles being used.. plenty of battles scenes (although the effects are a bit weak sometimes). Decent acting from the characters.

Oddly enough, the film is very watchable too largely due to the actors.  Peter Strauss is very handsome here and has a slight Han Solo act going.  He meets up with Molly Ringwald and their relationship is hard to decipher at times.  It seems they always end up sleeping together in silver quilted sleeping bags, her arm draped across him even though he could be her father.
Is their relationship romantic or platonic?  Hard to tell here.
The special effects are very well done and the scenery beautiful!  There is just enough action and just high enough production and just strange enough situations to keep one interested even though there isn't anything too, too deep here.

best aspects of the film. The production design is brilliant

It is a ""B"" grade movie, no doubt. That is reflected in its choices for casting, loose connections between some scenes, and healthy dose of ""hokiness"". But being a ""B"" grade movie doesn't make it bad. Actually, I find it an easy movie to sit back and enjoy. The scenery and sets do a lot for this movie. The apocalyptic flavor will entice any who are into this type of sci-fi. The sets and props, albiet low budget, were visually well crafted and did a lot to make this film. The actors aren't box office giants, although Molly later goes on to do well there. Even so, they have what this film really needed to pull off the reality of the characters, that is they were not so full of themselves to feel this movie was beneath them. They were their characters and played them true. Well..., maybe not the three actresses who were stranded and kidnapped in the beginning.

There are many ""B"" grade movies that have strong followings despite the label ""B"". I am not sure if this film has any sort of cult following, but it wouldn't surprise me. For me it is a nice movie to get immersed in for a couple of hours with friends or family and not worry about foul language, soft or hard porn, or explicit violence depicted with copius blood and gore. My wife and I saw it at the drive-in in 1983 and I later shared it with our children on VHS. I was pleased to find it on DVD, especially since it has long disappeared from most movie rental shelves.

So here's the deal, it wasn't near as good as I remembered; the FX are a joke by today's standards. Flash light on the air bubbles for stars, etc. It is a cheese covered corn-dog of a film, still fun but not nutritious.

711839,5,6303686788,"The 1980's gave us plenty of Sci-Fi adventures with the likes of Flash Gordon, Krull, The Last Starfighter, Buckaroo Banzai and Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone. ""Spacehunter"" ranks right up their with the others I've mentioned as being one of my favorites. The year is 2136 and Wolff (Peter Strauss) is a galactic bounty hunter on his way to Terra Eleven to rescue three Earth maidens from the evil clutches of someone or something called Overdog. The mechanical menace Overdog is the ruler of Terra Eleven and its grotesque assortment of plague infested mutants and monsters and he doesn't like outsiders entering his junkyard.

Overdog (Michael Ironside) is a vicious and savage ruler who takes pleasure in killing people in his metal gauntlet of death. Early on Wolff attempts to rescue the maidens but he encounters Overdogs henchmen as they've already kidnapped the maidens and taken them to the forbidden zone for Overdogs pleasure. As Wolff sets out for the forbidden zone he meets a very sarcastic and annoying Earth waif named Niki (Molly Ringwald) who tells Wolff she's a tracker and can lead him to Overdog and his scrap heap of a kingdom. After some reluctance the two of them form a friendship and along the way we see Niki's character become less obnoxious and more tolerable.

I really like Michael Ironside playing evil/bad characters and feel they could have done more if he wasn't covered in all that hardware. The picture and sound quality for this release is pretty decent but I feel it could have been much better. There is some evidence of deterioration and age related issues in the print and the picture is grainy at times. The disc is double sided and offers both full and widescreen versions.

Even though this movie was originally presented in 3-D format, Sci-fi adventure fans will still enjoy ""Spacehunter"" and its special effects. This Sci-Fi B-movie from 1983 is 90 minutes of pure fun and still very entertaining.

711840,4,6303686788,"Ah... the joys of pulp-science fiction. To experience the kind of stories more often found in old comic books come on the big screen can be confusing to some, but not this comic book fan. Spacehunter, along with movies like Star Wars and Flash Gordon, uses a tried and true model reminiscent of the classic Saturday morning serials. In spite of it's B-rated budget and content Spacehunter still comes out a winner.

You can see the main influences come from the post apocalyptic genre of movies like The Road Warrior, but the space opera genre is still strong with dastardly villians, brave heroes, damsels in distress, and all that. Add a sprinkle of adventure and you pretty much get the recipe of Spacehunter.

In a single word, Spacehunter is fun. The content is light and not thought provoking, but at the same time not overly simplified. You will catch some lame terminologies like 'mega space credits' and some of the spaceships look like they were made from styrofoam, but at least those shortcomings are few. Special effects work well enough and compliment the story instead of detracting from it. The props and technology range from ""what?"" to ""cool"". Gun props aren't overdone with odd accessories and the attachments they do use work well with the pace of the movie. I particularly enjoyed that mini missile launcher. Vehicles are kinda neat, and most of them are smart designs. Gotta love Wolfe's Scrambler.

The acting from the main characters is what sets this B-movie apart from most. Every one of them gave subtle and believable performances that were a very pleasant difference from most B-list science fictions. Molly Ringwald does a great job in her big screen debut as the lovable yet bratty Nikki. Peter Strauss does the standard Saturday matinee hero with style, and the hero/sidekick chemistry between Strauss and Ringwald was a treat to behold. Like I said, pretty much the entire main cast of characters made the movie as good as it is.

The DVD itself pretty much gives you the movie and that's about it. No special features or dynamic dolby audio. Just the movie and some scene selections. So keep that in mind when deciding to drop some coin on owning a copy.

I recommend Spacehunter for anybody who wants a good popcorn sci-fi flick that's not too violent or vulgar, but still wrought with low budget entertainment. Keep in mind it was made as a 3-D movie so some takes were made to fly off the screen, but of course won't. This movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If you're the type of person who can love a movie that's light on serious sci-fi content but chunky on the fun give Spacehunter a shot.",1182902400,2,2637,4.723913043478261

As McNab, Ironside is great as always, and there's just enough invention to offset the obvious genre influences, which, as other people have noted, are actually more on the Mad Max than the Star Wars side of things.",1101340800,12,724,4.753968253968254
711937,2,6303686788,"Way back in the early 80's we were still suffering from a glut of cruddy science fiction films trying to either emulate or capitalize of the successes of George Lucas' Star Wars films.  Around that same time, a handful of films were released in 3D like Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D (1983), Jaws 3-D (1983), and this film, Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone (1983).  Now, 3D technology, if done well, and properly shown, looks great (sometimes the process involved two, separate projectors to show two negatives at once, as long as the projectors were in sync, but that wasn't always the case), but it's more or less just a crummy gimmick to push a rotten film.  The last time I saw a really good film in 3D was The House of Wax (1953), starring Vincent Price, at Chicago's Music Box Theater during a midnight showing on Halloween, involving a highly specialized projector, but I digress...

Spacehunter (the Columbia/Tristar DVD release seems to have dropped the `Adventures into the Forbidden Zone' part as it was silly to begin with, but Amazon seems to have kept it in their listing of the title on their site...hee hee), directed by Lamont Johnson, whose career mostly consists of made for TV movies and episodes of various television programs (as I've said before, stick with what you know), lists six writers...that's right, I said six writers...with the main two being Len Blum and Daniel Goldberg, both of whom share writing credits for Meatballs (1979) and Stripes (1981), two really funny films, both produced by Ivan Reitman, who also produced Spacehunter.  So let's sum up...Blum + Goldberg + Reitman + comedy = Good...Blum + Goldberg + Reitman + science fiction = Bad...very bad...and things only get worse from here...cast (or horribly miscast, in my opinion) in the film are serious actor Peter `Rich Man, Poor Man' Strauss (funny, I don't recall any other sci-fi films to his credit after this one), and the ever annoying Molly Ringworm...er, I mean Ringwald, prior to her successes in a handful of John Hughes films, but currently resides in Hollywood's extensive `where are they now?' file.  Also appearing are Ernie Hudson (Ghost Busters, The Crow), and Michael Ironside (Highlander II: The Quickening, Total Recall) as the main bad guy (oooh, that's a bit of inspired casting, since nearly every film I've ever seen him in he's played the bad guy).

The film's plot, such as it is, involves a sort of bounty hunter named Wolff (the second F is some lame attempt at coolness, I suppose) played by Strauss, who learns of a reward for the recovery of three comely space maidens (bimbos), stranded on a distant planet when the space transport ship they were traveling on was completely destroyed due to some kind of snafu or other, and they were forced to flee in an escape craft.  The planet they landed on, colonized many years ago, is infested with mutants and such as a plague has since transformed many of the original colonists, and now they are governed by a huge, cybernetic dictator named Overdog (Ironside), who has since captured the three women.  As Wolff arrives on the planet, he meets Nikki the Twister (Ringwald), a human enough resident who claims she can help Wolff track the missing women in exchange for food.  Wolff, Overdog, Nikki the Twister?  Man, this film's got some dumb character names...along the way, the run into various characters, monsters, and various groups of mutants, all leading up to a final confrontation with Overdog and his lackeys.  That's about it...

First of all, I will say the studio that produced this film sure sunk a lot of money into the sets, location shots, and props.  That's about as much credit I can give to the movie.  The directing isn't bad, and neither is the acting, as the main problems the film has is within the casting, script, and plot.  Strauss seems to be trying, but he never quite fits into place as the loner space jockey type.  Ringwald is the worst, in my opinion, but then I've never really cared for her all that much anyway.  She's woefully miscast here, trying to be a spunky, smart alecky, street-wise waif that's supposed to put us off at first, but then is supposed to grow on us as the film proceeds.  That never happens, as she's just completely annoying throughout, especially with her incredibly stupid moron-speak similar to that used by the lost children in Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome (1985).  It was kinda cute in that film, but not so here.  Ringwald is at her best when playing what she knows, the whiny, self-important, snobby, bratty, stuck up suburban high school princess, as was the case in many of her John Hughes films, but here she's completely out of her element, as the limits of her range as an actress do not extend very far.  Ironside is wasted here, as he is buried under so much prosthetics.  Some actors can make it work, like Karloff as Frankenstein's monster, but then Ironside is no Karloff.  The plot drifts aimlessly from one stupid encounter to another, with scenes meant to display a budding relationship between Wolff and Nikki, but it was hard to maintain interest regardless of what was happening.  Not only that, but there's a creepy, underlying sexual vibe throughout the film, between Wolff and Nikki, Nikki and Overdog, and Overdog and the bimbos, one that didn't help me any getting through the film.

The picture on this DVD is wide screen of sorts, and looks kind of shabby, as evidence of age has begun to affect the negative.  Also, the tones are drab, making the film look pretty dull and lifeless.  There is also a full frame version available here, on the flipside of the DVD.  As far as special features go, there are three trailers for other films, Krull, Men in Black, and Starship Troopers and that's it...

711938,5,6303686788,"I love this movie. Yes it is definitely a B-movie, but as a B-movie I think it's one of the great ones.

It comes from the era when Mad Max and the Road Warrior were all the rage and so has the same ""lost in a decaying forbidden zone"" kind of feel.

After trying to be a serious actor and starring in things like the TV mini-series ""Rich Man, Poor Man"", Peter Strauss' career obviously stalled, as by 1983 he was reduced to starring in B-grade fare like this. And Molly Ringwald, fresh from ""The Facts of Life"" and prior to her becoming the 80s teen movie queen, has never been more annoying -- which is just what the script called for her to be: an annoying, whiney early teen. And ""Ghostbusters'"" Ernie Hudson also shows up to round out our cast of heroes.

This movie has everything -- from androids to sea monsters and mad scientists to amazons.

The costuming and set design are also well done and imaginative, especially the ultra-cool villain Overdog (played to perfection by Michael Ironside) and his nightmarish death maze.

If you're looking for meaningful or ""serious"" sci-fi you should probably look elsewhere. But if you're looking for some purely mindless entertainment which doesn't take itself too seriously and lets you just turn off your brain, chill out and be transported to another universe, this movie is perfect.

Our hero (Peter Strauss) goes to a forbidden planet to rescue three space vixens from the clutches of an evil being that can only be described as monstrous. He is bald and attached by the head to something that looks like the mecahnical arms the paint cars at the GM plant. His hands are huge tri-claws. His only real purpose is to laugh a lot and look grimacing. In the end he dies while trying to 'steal the youth' of the young Molly.
In the beginning of the flick we have a real nice, low-budget 'Mad Max' type battle, but it picks up and moves on to greater things; a black dude joins up with them, but really has no purpose in the story, babies throw explosives down on them from the clifftops, the 'Death Maze' is the ultimate game show from hell, and our villian is a pervert who prefers his women to be undressed 'sl-o-o-o-o-wly' in front of him.
If this movie could possibly be any better, Mr. T and Nell Carter would have to do a cameo as guardians of the Neptune Moon Tressure.",1074124800,5,1149,4.348837209302325
711941,2,6303686788,"Three years after ""Facts of Life,"" but a year away from her triumphant role in ""Sixteen Candles,"" Molly Ringwald finds herself the prisoner of some tricked-out bum named Overdog on a junk planet that looks like Fred Sanford's backyard.  Peter Strauss, the poor man's Richard Chamberlain, plays the poor man's Han Solo (or Lone Starr, if you prefer) and tries to rescue her.

Yes, ""Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone"" is low-budget fun directed by Lamont Johnson.  According to the IMDb, Johnson once played Tarzan on radio.  With this movie, he shows a keen radio performer's eye for cinema.  Ripping off ""Star Wars"" and ""Road Warrior"" and featuring more rickety metal garbage than any four episodes of TLC's ""Junkyard Wars,"" this flick has a spunky little heart but little else to offer.

Ringwald would go on to become John Hughes' teen muse and the undisputed 80s teen comedy queen, usually playing upper middle class girls dating sexless, nonthreatening gimps like Andrew McCarthy.  Here, she's a punky little spitfire who needs a bath and a shave.  Come to think of it, she IS the spunky little heart of this movie.  The rest of it can go to hell!  But I kid ""Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone.""  It's a silly movie with a clumsy title, yet worth watching with friends some drunken evening.  But please- try not to confuse ""Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone"" with ""Metalstorm:  the Destruction of Jared Synn.""  They both have colons in their titles, and promise things like ""adventures,"" ""destruction"" and ""Jared Synn.""

But only ""Spacehunter:  Adventures in the Forbidden Zone"" has Molly Ringwald being tortured by Michael Ironside.  Ask for it by name!",1059004800,26,1697,5.0359712230215825
