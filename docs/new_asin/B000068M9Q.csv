1725434,5,B000068M9Q,"Watched this as a child.  This series is so much better than cartoons.  The shows even though they were made in the 60's is so futuristic.  The space station, nuclear devices, unheard of in the 60's.  Did Gerry Anderson have a premonition of things to come.  I wonder !!.",1051401600,4,271,4.448979591836735
1725435,5,B000068M9Q,"Thunderbirds are Go!!
And so is this Mega edition of this show!!!
I'm real picky when it comes to production values, plot, plausibility, detail, etc., you get the idea.  I loved this show when it aired back in the 60s and was real happy to see it finally released it on DVD, when I first saw the singles and smaller DVD sets on the store shelves.  But when I saw this MEGA-Set, I leaped at the chance to get ALL the episodes of this incredible show.
The series takes place in the future and granted much of the high techy-ness on the show is laughable (they still use reel to reel audio tape to record their transmissions), but its great nonetheless.  The producers of this series took their work seriously and it shows in each and every episode.
There are obviously holes in much of the story-line and technical plausibility aspects of the show (Why does The Hood only want to take pictures of Internation Rescue's equipment?  Wouldn't detailed diagrams and plans for building the stuff be much better?), but I consider the painstaking detail taken in the model construction, set design, SPXs and puppetry to be top notch, even in our Star Wars era of technology.
As I watch each episodes now, I'm surprised at some of the relationships I never noticed as a kid (Do you know who Tin Tin's uncle is?)and I find myself at the edge of my seat in suspense as I watch some of the shows. (Will The Thunderbirds rescue Alan Tracy before the bomb goes off, or worse, before he falls off the bridge from heat exhaustion?!?!)
I'm just a old kid at heart and watching this series again makes we remember when I first began to love Sci-Fi.
I highly reccommend this for the kids(You may even want to let your children watch the DVDs!).",1046649600,6,1723,4.49520766773163

I was wrong.  This show still rocks!  As an adult I can appreciate the time and effort it took to film a series like nothing else on television.

I never watched Thunderbirds during their original run, oddly. In my youth I enjoyed the first runs of Supercar and Firebal XL5, then I guess I grew out of such things, at least for a time, though I always retained fond memories of those two early Anderson efforts. Much later, when Stingray aired on cable I picked up the torch again and have never set it down since. To be honest, Stingray for me has the best mix of production magic and character interaction, but there's no debating which Anderson series had the most impact, and that's this one. On the basis of sheer scale and technical achievement, Thunderbirds dwarfs its sibling series. If you have already participated in its surreal universe, you don't need to be convinced.

1725462,5,B000068M9Q,"I believe that a lot of the problem is people do not understand how WideScreen in theatres came about, back in the fifties theatre owners wanted a cheap way of getting a wider image on the screen

The 35mm release print image is a 1.37:1 'flat' Academy ratio format, but if you use an aperture plate in the projector with a roughly hewn oblong shape cut in the middle of it and hay presto! - You've got your self - `WideScreen' (1.85:1)

All of the TV crews that worked on the classic shows from the sixties (including Thunderbirds), all came from the film industry. Cinematographers would (and still do), compose all their camerawork for the WideScreen image, but `protect' the Full image from microphones and other filming equipment if the show they were working on was to be broadcast in Full frame or square

That is why shows from the sixties will work in both Full (1.33:1) and WideScreen (1.78:1) 'TV' formats",1341014400,3,916,4.6419753086419755

1725464,4,B000068M9Q,"There's a new Blu-Ray edition of this collection, which has been cropped to fit widescreen TVs. BE CAREFUL WHICH SET YOU PURCHASE, because the newer edition is missing a large chunk of the image!  See the note at the bottom.  Now, onto the review of this incredible show:

*************************

This is perfect entertainment.

Everyone can appreciate a good puppet show, and everyone can appreciate a good model; but this show took puppet shows and models to a bold new level of detailing and production complexity. I imagine that on paper it might have looked crazy to some, but believe me, it works. It is indeed, as mentioned in another viewer's comment, like a world of toys come to vibrant life.

The making of this show necessitated a fabricated miniature universe. For the premise to work, that world had to be obsessively detailed, with every doorknob, switch, coat button and lock of hair. If the show went to the mountains, they created the mountains. When the ships were in flight, they created the sky. Whatever was needed to pull the story off was built; there was no limit. That these people created a world as believably as they did deserves real praise.

""Thunderbirds"" represented a budgetary step up and a refinement of technique for Gerry Anderson, who for years had worked to perfect an all-puppet TV show that could be taken as serious drama. It was always targeted at kids, but the stories seldom featured child characters, and being a ""rescue show,"" the characters were routinely placed in very threatening predicaments. The effects used to depict scenes of destruction (supervised by Derek Meddings) were often frighteningly realistic. When I saw it as a kid, actually, I had no interest in it, because it seemed dry and ""too adult."" Seeing it many years later, my reaction was ""Wow! How adult!""

The show is the source of many amusing chuckles today, mainly because its scary seriousness is absolutely unflinching, despite the fact that the action is being played by distinctly toylike puppets. The action was played straight, with appropriate dramatic music cues, and conventional film camera angles and cutting. This all conspired to create a very convincing puppet universe--it's an approach that no one would dare attempt today...and that's why it seems so wild. Gerry Anderson had created several similar puppet shows previous to this, which were all various levels of good. But these previous shows really were just warm-up exercises in preparation for this extremely polished, extremely serious show. Puppets in peril! It works, plain and simple.

The recent DVD releases (from A&E) have gone through a digital cleanup process, which has brightened the colors and sharpened the images considerably. The original monaural audio has also been incorporated into a new surround-stereo ""remix"" featuring additional sound effects tracks (Anderson was on-board as a restoration consultant, and was reportedly very happy with the audio augmentations). The remixed explosions are deafeningly loud at times--which is perhaps as it should be!

In a word: Astonishing.

*******************

SIDE NOTE:...............Yep...the earlier A&E DVD releases from 2002 are in the original 4:3/1.33:1 aspect ratio. This is much preferable to any version cropped into a 16:9 ratio. The people making these decisions to crop films are misguided, and they are altering the product in a way that appeals to the uneducated consumer, who will not notice the missing image information, but will simply say, ""Oh, it's filling up my widescreen TV completely! That's awesome."" Well, it's a crying shame that this sort of cropping is done. ""Thunderbirds"" was extremely expensive television to produce, and the money all went on the screen, in the form of all those miniature sets and puppet constructions. You want to see all that great stuff, don't you? Then buy the DVDs featuring the show in its original 4:3/1.33:1 aspect ratio. Like one of the other reviewers says, if you want to crop the image, you can then do it yourself with your TV remote by hitting the zoom button. My advice (which you need not take!) is: Don't ruin a great show by opting to buy the lesser/cropped version of it! Get the full 1.33:1 aspect ratio and see the whole darn photographed image.",1335830400,,4274,5.09

1725482,4,B000068M9Q,"Even thought the origianl sereis was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio and this release is has been re-formated to fill a 1.85:1 widescreen TV I can't really complain.  I know Granada did 2 Hi-Def transfers,  1.33:1 and this 1.85:1, both really should have been included for the viewer to choose.  However, when dealing with puppets and since I own the previous DVD release the amount of visual information cut off in order to make a widescreen presentation isn't really all that much.  In fact, the top part of the origianl picture being cut off just mean less wires to be seen.
The 5.1 soundtrack is the same that was previously released on DVD but it's a bit more cleaner in tone now.  I live in the US and since most Blu-rays are region free I was happy to get this release have be able to play in on my Panasonic player.  The downside it that the bonus materials won't play.  I don't understand why, I've purchased Blu-rays released in the UK before and they all play fine.  My guess is the bonus material on this release are NOT in HD.
The elements used for this release have been cleaned up and color corrected a bit and it shows off for the better in HD.  I was surprised that the grain level was so low, especially since the image was blow-up in order to fill the widescreen monitor for 1.85:1.
Fans the series, as with most of the Gerry Anderson sereies tend to be a bit hyper and will put down any release if it isn't up to their standards.  They need to cut-the strings and get with life in the real world and open their minds a bit.  After all Gerry Anderson has been given all the credit over the years while his wife Sylvia played a major role in the look and construction of these series - probably much more than anyone has given her credit.  Every sereis the man has produced without her has failed.
If you enjoyed the series I'd say go out and get this Blu-ray release.  Unless you sit side-by-side and do a comparsion of the two aspect ratios, I doubt you'll miss anything.  In a perfect world it would have been nice to have a choice, but I'd rather have this release than anything by A&E.",1255996800,3,2103,4.331632653061225
1725483,5,B000068M9Q,"Well, I recently bought the three disc set of The Thunderbirds on bluray without knowing that the show had been re-formatted to 16:9 widescreen and what do you know?  I loved it!  Someone is at last caring about the fact that people like us have actually spent large amounts of money to buy Hi Def Wide Screen plasmas and LCDs and therefore should be looked after wherever possible.

Knowing a bit about Gerry Anderson's career I wonder (though I admit I don't really know) if he while shooting the show in 4:3, was in fact composing the footage to accomodate a wide screen format in later years?  I know that's asking a bit too much but I love the way they have done it here...I have a wide screen TV.  I bought it so I could watch wide screen movies, and to see one of my favourite TV shows as a child in wide screen (and I really don't give a damn about some minor cropping of image, I can't really point to it and say 'hey where's that bit at the bottom gone?') is just wonderful.

TV when first introduced, adopted the 4:3 ratio primarily because square tubed TVs were comparitavly easy to produce, while bulkier 16:9 tubes were just technologically too difficult.  It's also worth pointing out that the majority of movies made prior to the early 1950s were all shot on 35mm film stock in 4:3 ratio and this must have influenced the type of screen aspect ratio TV would use.  Yes no 16:9 'Wizard of OZ', 'Gone With The Wind' or 'Metropolis'.  I believe that a re-formatted version of 'Gone with the Wind' was released in 1959 in 16:9 to celebrate it's 20th aniversary, whether it still exists is anyone's guess, but at least we know that the DVD era is not the first time film makers have tried to 're-do' films.

While the limitations of sound for 60s TV is evident here in this edition (you just have to accept that Thunderbirds original soundtrack is a monural mix) some phasing of sound to the rear speakers is evident however the audio is mostly channeled to the centre and front speakers.

All that aside, Thunderbirds is definatley 'GO' in widescreen.",1247184000,2,2063,4.489304812834225

1725497,5,B000068M9Q,"By far, the very best of the Gerry Anderson Supermarionation series, is the Thunderbirds! When the Andersons started with Supercar, the process of Supermarionation was crude by today's standards. As each series progressed, the process was refined and improved. The first test came, when Stingray was released. Stingray focused on its story line and its characters. Even though Stingray lasted for one season, the experience allowed the Andersons and their production team, to develop the Thunderbirds. The Thunderbirds is the story of former astronaut turned businessman, Jeff Tracy. Mr. Tracy used his fortune, to develop a world wide rescue service that would be known as International Rescue. His chief scientist, Brains, allowed the Thunderbirds to become a reality. Mr. Tracy knew in order for his organization to be effective, it had to remain a secret to the outside world in regards to their location or their base of operations. Enlisting the services of his sons Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John, enhanced the security of their operations. Their chief nemesis, is ""The Hood"". He was always after the secrets of International Rescue and the Thunderbird ships themselves. International Rescue had the equipment available, to handle any type of rescue situation - above or below the sea, above or below ground, in the air or in space. Having a proper lady like Lady Penelope and her chauffer Parker, to handle the convert aspects of International Rescue, adds to the appeal to the Thunderbirds. The Andersons kept the story line they used during Stingray. The Good Guys won over the Bad Guys and the ones who were in trouble, were rescued at the end.
  The Thunderbirds lasted for two seasons. When it was not picked up by one of the networks in the United States, the production of the Thunderbirds came to an end. The series continued to enjoy success during its runs in syndication. The success of the original Thunderbirds series, led to a major motion picture, starring Bill Paxson as Jeff Tracy. Director Jonathan Frakes, kept with the story line of the original series. Ben Kingsley was very good in his role as The Hood.
  The 40th anniversary collectors set of the Thunderbirds, is a must for anyone's DVD Collection. The Thunderbirds can be best described as ""Vintage Gerry Anderson!""",1229472000,2,2305,5.057894736842106

1725504,5,B000068M9Q,"For those of you who do not know what Thunderbirds is I will give you a quick rundown. It was an immensely popular science fiction show back in the 60's done almost entirely with marionettes and models. The show chronicled the adventures of an independent organization called International Rescue that used highly advanced vehicles and equipment to perform rescue operations all over the world (and even in space). The show was popular because it paid a great amount of attention to detail, which made those models, puppets, and story plots all the more real and exciting.

This show was previously released on DVD a few years ago, including a complete collection set. So what makes this 40th Anniversary Edition different from the previous release? The big answer is that this collection is digitally remastered and is now shown in its original VIDECOLOR format. Now the original disks shown some signs of remastering as well and the shows never looked better. I'm not sure how much of an improvement this edition will make on that achievement, but it is one of their big selling points.

Aside from the remastering you also get some additional features not included in the original release. Here's a breakdown of all the features:

Making of Featurette: this was in the original DVD set and it's a ten minutes long vintage documentary that mostly covers the innovative (for its time) special effects for the show. These effects were so innovative they were used in many of the James Bond films of the day.

Interview with Gerry Anderson: this is a 40 minute interview with the creator of Thunderbirds (as well many other popular sci-fi shows like UFO, Space 1999, and other puppet-driven thrillers). This in depth conversation also has Gerry talk about his seven favorite projects (he created a total of 15 television shows).

The Brains Behind the Thunderbirds: A documentary narrated by a character of the show: Brains. This hour long feature covers the various characters and their exploits in the series.

Pop Up Trivia - The two part episode ""Pit of Peril"" will include a pop up trivia track much like the ones they shown on TechTV's release of the show.

There are also lots of production photos and gallaries placed throughout the disks in this 12 disk collection (features are on disk 12). This collection has all 32 one-hour episodes included and is mastered in Dolby Stereo (just like the first release). Total run time is about 26 hours.

If you do not have the Thunderbirds in your collection now is a perfect time to get it. The list price is a good deal lower than the original list price for the first collection plus the packaging takes up a good deal less space (not to mention the remastering and extra features). If you have the original set then I suppose it's going to be a judgement call. I haven't heard any first hand accounts on how much an improvement the remastering will be compared to the original and I can't see how a couple of new featurettes would be enough to do a double dip.",1200614400,95,3012,4.756704980842912
1725505,5,B000068M9Q,"When you watch the Thunderbirds, you must realize this show is forty years old and still holds up. These marriottes are real looking, special effects still hold up after 40 years...and the story lines are intriging

So forget that satire Team America and the live action version of the Thunderbirds, get this..maybe those kids who crave SF adventure can enjoy this complex story lines, rather than those show with 30 second sound bytes of action

 The Thunbderbirds (which was orginally called The international Rescue organization) is filled with  great sets, characters and vehicles (as I said this was 40 years ago).These episodes still hold up. When you sound like a naysayer about these shows, THINK Classic Star Trek! It , in my opinion, still holds up  just like classic Trek.

All the episodes are here. uncut and intriging, when you want a show the whole family can enjoy, this is it--action and good story lines for the adults, special effects for the kids

If you like this, get some of Gerry Anderson's  other TV shows on DVD... Supercar, Captain Scarlet,Stingray,  Joe 90, Space 1999 (yes the Martin Landau/Barbara Bain space opera), The protectors (with Robert Vaughn) and a weaker effort Secret Service. for US audiences, remember buy region one.

For puppets , these shows had complex stories  and over the top characters..worth you time to get and enjoy

My 3 year old niece normally gets scared of science fiction shows, but the marionettes didn't bother her and pretty soon she was talking the ""5..4..3..2..1 Thunderbirds are GO!"" introduction. I think this is a great family show because the plot lines are easy to understand, such as helping people stuck in a building or stopping a crazy dude from hurting people. Also, the characters are so lively because they enjoy what they are doing. Many children from my mother's day were inspired by these lifesavers to become pilots and astronauts.

Throw in some eye opening and lavish (miniature 1/3 scale puppets) sets, special effects, and a ""gee whiz!"" attention to detail, and you begin to get an idea of why ""Thunderbirds"" has such a cult following. The scripts are involving and could just as easily have been performed by live actors with good results. There are enough cool gadgets in this series to please the ten year old boy in every grown up man (I suspect this series is more of a guy thing because relationships take second place to action).  There is something else fascinating about this series and that is how seriously the producers, directors, designers took what was essentially a children's puppet show and kept to such high (and unnecessary) standards. This may be partly due to producer Gerry Anderson's frustrated desire to work as a mainstream film director/producer with live actors (he eventually got his wish years later). Seeing marionettes perform in realistic sets, with sophisticated action scripts, and good voice acting is a novel experience that appeals to everyone who has ever had a train set and tried to build a miniature town or city.
