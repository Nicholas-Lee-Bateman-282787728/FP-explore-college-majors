8286191,5,B001C6RPOU,"It is exactly as stated. There are 40 total episodes in the total series but this is only the first 13 episodes. Video quality is DVD quality. It is REGION 2, which means, you need either an unlocked DVD/Blu-ray player or you need to watch these on a computer. (Don't give it negative rating if you did not read first before buying). Sound is very good and crisp. The original theme song has not been changed. Hopefully they will come back to this and release all the episodes on DVD.
