4848029,2,B005NKIPTU,"This anthology consists of three gross and twisted tales from the UK. Each tale pretty disgusting, fetishy and not horrifying. Whatever it takes to gross you out. From medical experiments with giant anatomies to men pretending to be dogs for their mistresses. There is no humor, charm, energy, or emotion from any of the actors. Most of the movie lot of it is boring setup to little payoff. You get more entertainment out of watching 3 episodes of Tales from the Crypt. If you are looking for something twisted and fetishy, this is for you, otherwise check out Creepshow. Creepshow 3 was more entertaining.",1348358400,,606,4.836538461538462
4848030,3,B005NKIPTU,"To start, I want to point out something that probably doesn't need to be pointed out, and point it out anyway, and that is the fact that the title of this movie, LITTLE DEATHS, is actually a metaphor for ""orgasm"".  With that in mind, the theme of this movie should be easier to guess.

LITTLE DEATHS is an anthology film from 2011, made in the UK by three separate writer/directors: Sean Hogan, Andrew Parkinson and Simon Rumley.  The stories all fall into the horror category and all feature some kind of sexual perversion, hence the title of the movie.

Does it succeed?

I guess, to an extent.

The quality of the stories varies greatly from the merely passable (""House and Home"", which opens the movie) to the incredibly demented (""Mutant Tool"", the halfway point) to what I would almost consider a literary horror tale (""Bitch"", the closing segment).  Taken as a whole, they form an alright movie.  Not something I'd likely watch again, but not something I feel I wasted 95 minutes on.  Taken individually, the stories, scripts and performances all leave different impressions.

""House and Home"" tells the story of Richard and Victoria Gull, a rich couple who share a desire to humiliate and torture the less fortunate.  This fetish manifests itself in their forays into the homeless world where they like to pick a suitable victim, bring that person to their home with tales of Christian charity, ply them with drugged wine, and then bind them in a back bedroom where Richard rapes them, then turns them over to Victoria so she too can have her way.  What usually happens to these victims, we don't know, because their latest, Sorrow, turns the tables pretty quickly, inviting a dozen other mutated homeless over for a hot meal of Victoria while Sorrow and her boyfriend try to figure out how long they keep Richard alive if they keep him doped up and control the bleeding.

This was a ho-hum story.  It's not the first turning of the tables story I've seen, nor is it the first homeless-people-as-monsters story, either.  Luke de Lacey and Siubhan Harrison give pretty decent performances as the depraved rich couple, but it's Holly Lukas who gives the best performance of all, probably of the entire movie, in every look, every expression, every gesture from the moment she wakes up bound and gagged to the moment Richard hears the screams.  It's only a few minutes, but Lukas makes every one of them count.

The second story, ""Mutant Tool"" is about a bound man with a two-foot ""tool"" who is constantly ejecting spunk into a bucket at his feet.  Hey, I didn't say these stories were tasteful.  Apparently this procedure goes back to the Nazis, and the extract-of-beast is used in a hallucinogenic drug, which ex-junkie and current prostitute Jen starts taking at the suggestion of her doctor, who was recommended by her boyfriend, who works for said doctor as a procurer of human livers, which is the only thing the mutant subsists on.  The drug causes a mental connection between Jen and the mutant, leading to a particularly disturbing final image.

Finally, ""Bitch"" tell of Pete and Clair, a London couple who, much like the Gulls, share a certain fetish.  Only this fetish consists of Pete donning a dog mask and being led around on a leash by Clair before she dons a strap-on and performs some bestiality on his boyfriend/pet.

All is well and good--or so it seems; truth is Pete doesn't want this and only does it because he knows Clair likes it--until one drunken night leads to Clair suggesting a threesome with Pete and his best friend, only Pete declines, so Clair makes it a twosome while Pete waits it out in the dog room, crying and coming to a fateful decision.

The thing about this story that struck me as so interesting was the roles the characters played.  Clair is without a doubt the epitome of bitch, always yelling at Pete for one thing or another, always taking advantage of him, being just a downright hateful person, yet the bitch who makes her boyfriend perform like a dog is actually terrified of real dogs, collapsing into a quivering mass of tears when she sees one.

And also, the third act of this story, as Pete begins to execute his plan for revenge against Clair for all the wrongs she's done him, is excellently filmed.  I really loved the last 10 minutes of this story and found both the story and the filmmaking very affective.  There's some excellent acting here by Tom Sawyer as Pete.

I'm not familiar with these filmmakers and haven't seen any of their other works, nor am I in a hurry to as, for the most part, LITTLE DEATHS reeked a little too heavily of gratuitous and desperate.  I mean, there wasn't one single idea in ""House and Home"" that I hadn't already read over a decade ago, while ""Mutant Tool"", which pretty original, also smacked of ""hey, look at how depraved I am!""  Only ""Bitch"" conveyed any sense of honest storytelling, with themes and characterization and development, those elements a good story is supposed to have.

There's a fair amount of gore here and plenty of nudity, both male and female, but very little point overall.  This movie is worth a viewing but only if you can handle the hardcore horror stuff; this movie isn't for the casual horror fan.  If you like the fiction of Edward Lee, then you'll probably like this movie.  Otherwise you might want something a little more . . . reserved.",1347235200,,5369,4.6937033084311635
4848031,2,B005NKIPTU,"The French word for ""orgasm"" translates in English into ""little death,"" and thus endeth the cleverest thing about this movie: the title. The movie is an anthology of three short films, and each story involves death and sex intertwined in some kind of macabre fashion.

HOUSE AND HOME: The first vignette is about a well-off couple that has a strange way of getting their rocks off that involves a third party. Everyone involved has a secret, and the twist lies in who's secret has got sharper teeth. Although the story isn't anything special (you can probably guess the ending in less than three tries), the acting and filming are excellent, and it moves fast enough to avoid losing interest. Four stars.

THE TOOL OF THE MUTANT: The second vignette is about an ex-working girl who is put on some strange medication by a doctor who also happens to employ her boyfriend (and former pimp). Needless to say, the medicine has unusual effects that culminate in a bad time for (nearly) all. Easily the grossest of the three shorts, this one also makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and it appears to have been written and filmed solely for shock value. The most shocking thing about it, though, is that anyone thought cheap gore would be a decent substitute for a total lack of logic and reason. Also features the worst acting of the whole group in the form of our lead. One star.

FEMALE DOG (to avoid angering Amazon's censors): The final vignette is about a young couple with a strange role-playing addiction that is taken a bit too far. The male of the couple has the best acting chops out of anyone associated with this whole film, and the complex relationship he's involved in is actually pretty interesting for the first half of the clip. However, by the time the relationship starts to unravel, the story slows to an annoying crawl. What should be a vicious and disturbing climax becomes, quite literally, a tiresomely long music video. The ending here isn't as senseless as Part Two, but it does still have quite a few holes, and these are made even more glaring by the director's weak attempt at irony (the last five minutes or so -- perhaps more -- are a montage set to cheery-sounding music). Two and a half stars.

Interesting idea for a film with mostly decent talent in front of the lens, but the writing and directing feel like a clumsy first timer's attempt at foreplay.",1344211200,3,2383,4.68019093078759
4848032,5,B005NKIPTU,"After buying and viewing this film I would have given it a definate 4 star review, but I figured I would give the extra star in an attempt to balance out the extreme low review by the gut who just didn't like this style of film.  Not a film that I would recommend to just anyone, but for those who enjoy movies like Hostel, Human Centipede, and Irreversible, this is a little gem from Britan.  It is composed of 3 short films by 3 different directors, the 1st being the shortest, but taken as a whole amount to an entertaining view.  I hate to classify it as torture/porn genre, but people who like those would probably enjoy this mix of sex and terror.  Some full frontal nudity throughout the films with a few shots of gore.  However what really impressed me the most about this film was the end of the final film, the presentation of his premeditation in getting his revenge on his lover was a great buildup to the final seconds where you see the sorrow on his face while hearing her screams in the background until the credits roll.  I felt it was a fairly powerful ending to the film, maybe not the most powerfull I have seen, but definately worth watching if you like this type of movie.",1341532800,,1193,4.351351351351352
4848033,1,B005NKIPTU,"*There is only one small spoiler in this review, but it may save some time and cash in these hard times.

Here is a very slow-paced thriller that is pure brain rot!  It has a lot of very twisted sexual fare, including rape, sick bondage, and animals.

The first story deals with an upper-class couple who get their kicks from raping, belittling, and abusing homeless women.  The couple lures a victim over to their pad with a nice sweet Jesus trick.  ""Come on over for free dinner because the Lord loves ya!""  A short time later, the homeless lady ends up with what the film ""Copycat"" calls ""spirit"" all over her face.  The male perpetrator finds a ""golden"" way to wash the lady's face clean.  Sick!  Then the rich perverts get their just deserts. Ready for a barf bag yet?

In the next story, a recovering lady drug addict and prostitute is prescribed pills from an underground Nazi doctor.  The pills are made from the ""spirit"" of a maimed man hanging from chains in bondage (with a welder's mask on his face).  The man is of abnormal size and produces large metal tubs filled with his ""spirit.""  To make sure that this poor victim does not go dry, he is fed special human organs (which look like bratwursts), from murdered individuals, through a tube after it is made into bloody liquid in a blender. Eating ""spirit"" pills causes hallucinations and a psychic link with bondage boy.  Ready to do a technicolor yawn?

The last story is for the dogs.  A woman treats her boyfriend like a dog.  He wears a doggie mask, crawls on all fours, lifts his leg, and goes pee on his girl's undies.  She punishes the bad dog by putting his face in it.  The girl has a doggie phobia and gets off by putting a leash around her boyfriend's neck and playing the male role with him doggie style.  The guy just takes all of this punishment until he is betrayed when his ""girlfriend"" has an affair with his best pot smoking buddy. *Spoiler! He gets real dogs and they eat his ex-girlfriend's butt.  Butt chow!  Time to drive the porcelain bus?

There was a time when anthology films had class.  Good examples, would be ""The House that Dripped Blood,"" ""Asylum,"" and the film version of ""Tales from the Crypt.""  Like the film being reviewed, these were also made in England by a company named Amicus Productions.  After viewing ""Little Deaths,"" special thanks should go to Eli Roth and the invention of ""Hostel.""  He started a trend of what has now become known as torture porn.  Now, directors are trying to push the limit of how perverted things can get.

If this is what the viewer really wants floating around in his or her brain, then by all means view until face turns blue.  Chow down on this nasty bit of cheese.  After all, it is a free country, so enjoy a whole metal tub full of this ""spirited"" film.  Otherwise, steer clear of this piece of garbage and enjoy this wonderful perfect planet.

They lure a young homeless woman to their home, then have their way with her! There are unintended consequences for all! #2 has an ex-hooker, drug dealer, with a slimeball boyfriend. She becomes an unknowing medical experiment thanks to slimball.

4848070,5,B005NKIPTU,"La Muertas Chiquitas will be a revelation to both women and men. It is a 5 hour long atlas of pleasure and pain that took Sallars fours years to put together, but it is worth every minute of intimacy (which the close-ups help to build) with all those women who were willing to expose their vulnerability, which is also their strength. In fact, through Sallars' well-crafted object, we come to understand why women's pleasure was always subsumed, disregarded or a non-object (even to this day, the clitoris occupies half a page in anatomy books if at all). It was/is so because women's pleasure carries with it the promise of a true liberation and as such it constitutes a threat to patriarchal society. Thus, through Sallars'personal ethnography we come to realize how the personal is indeed political! As one woman calls our attention, when women realize that they themselves through their actions and self-castration sustain patriarchy and that they should love themselves with all their idiosyncrasies, then the status quo will forcedly change.

an unfinished story of pleasure and violence

This is the film that I wish all women everywhere, especially teenagers, could see.  It should be seen in every high school ""health class"" and in every college gender studies curriculum. The relationship of women to their bodies, their desires, and to their ability to speak of these things with others, has everything to do with dissolving the myths that govern our lives. This is the film women have been waiting for... for a long time... and if I had my druthers, their would be such a film made with women in every country of the world.  Here, at last, are conversations with 30 Mexican women of all stripes... and all seem to have found language for their experience - not just sexual experience, but with all experience - social, historical, political. The critic Helena Braunstajn says this film is the place ""where pleasure is related to armed struggle, feminicide, transsexuality, women's liberation theology, prostitution, illness, exile, the plurality of Mexican identity, and the ethical commitment of art to socio-political reality. In the face of the existing system--as Las Muertes Chiquitas makes very clear--the land, the body, and the pleasure derived from their construction all reclaim their rights to an active, reflective, and inclusive participation.""

In Mexico, in 2006, a small miracle sets in motion.  Not the one you're thinking of involving a sainted young virgin of Guadalupe. In 2006 the Barcelona artist and filmmaker Mireia Sallars began interviewing, in complete intimacy, about thirty Mexican women, about just that - being women in Mexico and their sexual experiences. The film is called Las Muertes Chiquitas, `the little death', which, like the French le petite mort, is a slangy euphemism in Mexico for female orgasm... the post-orgasmic state of unconsciousness that some have after sex. The result is simple but explosive... a wild, five-hour film - revolutionary, and perhaps the most inviting and provocative non-fiction film I've seen since I first watched Buuel's Land Without Bread, or later Leslie Thornton's Adynata, or Harun Farocki's Images Of The World And Inscriptions Of War  - none of which it resembles...not at all. Sallars uses the simplest means. She records Las Muertes Chiquitas by herself, entirely in medium close-ups.

She encourages these women to speak: two anthropologists; a performance artist; an AIDS worker; a few sex-workers; a cabaret artist; two psychoanalysts; an historian; two ex-nuns; a journalist; a cross-dressing bisexual-trany who makes love both ways; a housekeeper; a psychologist; an actress; a philosopher; the coordinator of a residence for elderly prostitutes; two guerilleras... fighters in armed revolutionary struggle... one captured and held for eight years, one tortured; the director of a housing project for indigenous people; a seamstress and activist; the director of a shelter for battered women; a coordinator of a government project, La Condomvila... a van used to distribute information about HIV; the proprietress of a small sex shop; a worker in a self-managed, non-profit or for the reduction of poverty through personal development; a campaigner for justice against the Juarez perpetrators of kidnapping and murder; a campaigner for the rights of indigenous women, etc. There are tran and gender-queer and heterosexual women - women you will never meet ... at least I have never met... in any documentary in any other country, including yours.  She asks them to speak about, at first, orgasm... their own. What follows from orgasm are extraordinary stories and images of pleasure, pain and often damage. Large and small chunks of these conversations are intercut. At first you're not sure why... with what design. Where is this arrangement heading? Then you abandon speculation because you realize that there is no narrative here... no tale. Neither is there an apparent argument being articulated. What is clear is that what needs to be spoken is spoken in each case. For what... for lack of a better word, finally, for revelation. Yes... the R word. Also appropriate is the L word... for liberation. Have I drunk some Kool-Aid?

Las Muertes Chiquitas is libratory. Driven out is the ""advanced"" culture's conceit of superiority in discussing sexual matters, in general, and especially in public. (Films are very public documents.) Out goes the notion that a sincere, practicing Catholic woman in Mexico has no sexual self-knowledge and if she did, would refrain from telling it to a filmmaker, on camera, because she has no language for it or because she has not the courage to do so in the face of social criticism and ostracism. Out goes the notion that white middle class women (who else watches documentaries?) are more comfortable with our bodies than anyone else, and have fluency to discuss our genitals, our father's or husband's genitals, our sexual rage and our own, very varied, sexual pleasures and satisfactions and dismay. I'm 69 years old and I'm still wondering when if ever I will have a frank discussion about my sexual experience with friends... with anyone other than my shrink... and that only on rare occasions.  (So much for the second, third or fourth wave of feminism.) You watch the film and are stripped of all you ever thought about third world women. You settle down to learn... for 5 hours. That's how long it takes to weave these voices together... to put this experience in front of us. I took a break at midpoint with no damage, but it is completely compelling and hard to stop watching - you can feel something changing in you and charging you.

The film's subtitle, an unfinished story of pleasure and violence, helps connect the dots. There is abundant sexual violence against and around women in Mexico. There is intense repression described but there is also extremely sophisticated thinking about pleasure. One woman says, orgasm is ""like grabbing onto the wings of an angel who lowers me down to the ground."" Mireia's correspondents are prepared to talk about their histories and so the film goes there - not just to the violence but also to the relationship between violence and sexuality, and soon enough to violence, sex and spiritual revelation.

The first story House and Home, concerns a middle class couple who have peculiar tastes. This was my least favourite of the stories, it's wasn't a bad story, just a little obvious.

Mutant Tool is the second story and this was more interesting. It's mad scientist tale about an experimental drug that has some very strange effects, the horror comes from its source. It's a gritty story that builds nicely to a grim conclusion.

Bitch is the final story and the best of the bunch, this one is a simpler revenge story, but has an interesting path and I appreciated the climax.

Overall it's an interesting watch that tantalises and captivates, it's a little rough around the edges, enough so that it stops it from really shining, but well worth a watch.",1379203200,,968,4.643274853801169

The anthology feature begins with an affluent couple who share a particular taste for homeless women, but they get more than they bargained for when they invite Sorrow into their home. Next, a former prostitute creates a psychic link with an undead Nazi drone after taking an experimental drug made from its hallucinogenic seed. Lastly, a couple's role-playing adventures are pushed too far, forcing one of them to lash out in bloody revenge! Shocking, perverse, yet oddly alluring, LITTLE DEATHS is impossible to look away from. There is no telling what direction any of the stories will take as they dive into the deepest and darkest regions of human desire. The extreme nature of the shorts might make the film inaccessible to most audiences, but for all of the disturbing imagery displayed on screen, we are met with sharp cinematography and wicked performances from the entire cast. Experience the ultimate sexual shocker for yourself in LITTLE DEATHS!

4848075,4,B005NKIPTU,"After watching ""Little Deaths"" I was struck that it's three ero-horror vignettes were very reminiscent of a popular series of erotic horror book anthologies (initially) entitled ""Hot Blood"" that were first published in the 1990's and went on to include well over a dozen volumes of short story compilations that blend sex and terror elements to potent effect. The horror genre has certainly always had its' fair share of subliminal eroticism, particularly in the realm of movies dealing with vampire themes, but films that focus specifically on erotic horror are a rarer commodity and might be viewed as an area with much potential in the increasngly permissive world of cinematic themes. I have previously noted one of the sexy horror stories published in the ""Hot Blood"" series entitled ""Chocolate"" was included in the made for cable TV horror anthology : ""Masters of Horror"". I would suggest that the 'Masters of Horror' and the Scott's ""The Hunger"" series are perhaps the closest similar product to the concept of ""Little Deaths"" - but their content is not as overtly sexual in nature as 'Little Deaths'.

Other reviewers have done a good job of describing the content of the three stories presented in ""Little Deaths"" so I will not reiterate them again....over-all I enjoyed the entire show and found that the ideas, acting, and direction (by the 3 seperate film-makers) were of consistently high quality and, generally, very engaging. All 3 of the stories contained a strong dose of black humor within their twisted little plots but also presented 'endings' that were truly demented and hinted at unrelenting & unending karmic retribution... recalling some of the writing of previous horror masters such as Robert Bloch and Harlan Ellison.

Personally I would enjoy seeing more of this type of erotic-horror blend make its way to 'the screen' and I'd recommend ""Little Deaths"" to open minded individuals who enjoy a little ero-weirdness in their horror film viewing.",1357776000,2,1972,5.12111801242236
4848076,3,B005NKIPTU,"More about sick sexual themes than horror or death, this anthology presents a perverse trio of unlinked shorts that I hesitate to recommend to anyone other than fans of the torture-porn or Tokyo Gore Shock subgenres.  It's just for people who want to be shocked by the appalling.

The French word for orgasm translates into ""little death,"" clearly the etymology of this title.

This British anthology is about the most perverted I've seen.  Not for gore, torture or murderous means, but such from the darkest and most sexually depraved recesses of the fragmented mind.  These tales feature rape, masturbation, psychological abuse and BDSM...and images of full frontal nudity (male and female), urination, mutant genitals, vaginal bleeding, ejaculation and semen, with many of these themes and elements present in more than one of the shorts.  The ""horror"" themes seem minor; rarely supernatural and serving more to ""end"" the short stories instead or drive them.  This is clearly an inappropriate film which should not be taken lightly, not be presented to minors (or even most adults), or really recommended at all lest you be someone with cinematic tastes favoring shocking extremes.

Unlike more thoughtful anthologies, the three short films of this movie are not linked by an over-arching concept or storyteller.  They are simply presented one after another, each of them with shock-value-driven themes and lousy endings.  Below, I present a synopsis and critique of each short film.

House and Home-- Richard and Victoria Gull are an upper-middle class British couple that appear equal parts caring and cold.  Posing as religious do-gooders they lure homeless people into their homes for a kind meal, a bath and a night in a warm bed.  After luring a young woman (intriguingly named Sorrow) to their home for dinner, they drug her and take turns doing, ummmm, things to her.  MY CALL:  Sure, it opens and endures with a solid, sick but well-done, shock-schlock cinema appeal.  But it's ending degenerates into something overly simplistic as if the writers, or perhaps the director, got lazy and dumped some gaudy scene on us that relied on gore as a crutch rather than a cinematic device.  [B-/C+]

Mutant Tool-- Jen is an ex-prostitute, a drug dealer and an addict looking to kick her bad habits--all of them.  She seeks medical assistance from a shady doctor who prescribes a new, very promising drug that has its share of side effects including hallucinations and increased ""sexuality.""  However, the doctor is more concerned with experimenting on his patients than helping them.  MY CALL:  After a quick, cheap opening shock, this story really doesn't go anywhere until the very end, when an inanely ridiculous twist ending is shoved in our face.  Depending on your taste, you might even get a laugh out of it.  [C-]

B!+@#--Pete and Claire share an interesting relationship.  Claire is a psychologically abusive domme who weaponizes her sexuality against Pete.  Claire also has an irrational fear of dogs even though she has Pete behave, live and ""dress"" as a dog for her domination pleasure.  MY CALL:  The ending is quite sick and was likely intended to represent some manner of poetic justice.  I would suggest that, outside of a little shock value, this venture failed while still being the best ending of the anthology's shorts.  However, a fine job was done setting a depressed mood (from Pete's perspective) using blue-tone soft lighting and gritty film.  Their relationship was depicted very effectively and, beyond the aim of this film, told an interesting story on its own.  [C+]",1356566400,,3598,5.07495741056218

8480603,4,B005NKIPTU,An Interesting and well done collection of shorts. Perhaps a new direction in film making in collecting shorts into feature leght. The stories are fun and enjoyable (if you are into the horror) and the production quality is extremely high. A great work for aspiring film makers to show what can be done on a limited budget.,1427414400,,323,4.684210526315789
8480604,5,B005NKIPTU,"great anthology movie! has 3 short stories, all very sexual. If you're a horror fiend, I strongly suggest this one.",1425859200,,115,4.8

8480606,5,B005NKIPTU,"So twisted, so perverse. I love them both, but if I had to choose just one anthology horror movie I would definitely select this one over V/H/S because this one really twists the metaphorical knife. The third installment is slow to warm up, but it is by far the scariest.",1414972800,,271,4.44

8480608,5,B005NKIPTU,"SICK, TWISTED and SHOCKING! What more could you ask for in a movie these days? I don't care what kind of weird movies you've seen before, you ain't seen nothin' yet. UNIQUE for sure, but that word doesn't do it justice. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT??",1406764800,,244,4.326086956521739
