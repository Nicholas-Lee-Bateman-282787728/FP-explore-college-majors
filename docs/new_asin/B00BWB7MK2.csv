5679204,5,B00BWB7MK2,Achor is the best.  Great combination of science and happiness theory.  Even the naysayers have to pay attention to this guy.,1407283200,2,125,4.904761904761905
5679205,5,B00BWB7MK2,This tells you how you can be happier.  I found just knowing that it can be quite simple to be happier makes me happy.  So  I watch it when I want to be happy,1403308800,3,158,3.588235294117647
5679206,5,B00BWB7MK2,Very inspiring to learn how to be happy on a daily basis. Dave Povero keeps your interest up through the whole DVD. And his hints really help.,1402531200,,142,4.296296296296297
5679207,5,B00BWB7MK2,"If you want simple, practical suggestions of ways to increase your happiness, this is for you.  Author/speaker/researcher Shawn Achor is a fun presenter who offers 5 easy, but profound and effective practices that you can add to your day to help you become more happy and more successful.  My favorite one is simply, ""Add three smiles to your day.""  Make a conscious choice to smile at three people that you wouldn't naturally feel like offering a smile to.  This could be a neighbor, grocery clerk, whoever.  If you are like me, you may find yourself enjoying this so much that you will want to go far beyond the suggested three, and add lots of smiles to your day.  You might even want to look in a mirror and smile at yourself!  Sounds silly, maybe, I know.  But give this, and the other suggestions a try.  You'll be HAPPY you did!",1400371200,8,835,4.513333333333334
5679208,5,B00BWB7MK2,"Practical, doable ideas in addition to food for thought. One of those things we don't learn in school, but wish we did--we all need it! I wish everyone could see it. (Clips are on TED talks, but the ""how to"" is on the DVD.)",1399334400,11,223,4.090909090909091
5679209,5,B00BWB7MK2,Too bad Amazon has the wrong presenter name. Shawn Achor is an excellent presenter and his DVD is a nice one-hour summary of his book by the same name. I use it in my private practice. I recommend it highly.,1398470400,5,207,4.2
5679210,5,B00BWB7MK2,"Saw Shawn's program on TV.  It is very appropriate for families.  Recommend it to everyone who has members in their group that kill themselves by working 12 hours a day.  Probably does not apply to the US today since we are in a downward spiral.  However, it is appropriate for countries that demand their people work 12-15 hours a day at the lowest of wages.",1386979200,3,359,4.476923076923077
5679211,5,B00BWB7MK2,"Simple and straightforward, this is the real deal. Sure, you could have thought up, or remembered most of this stuff by yourself. But you didn't, you are here looking for answers. As usual the answers are not complicated, but they require our participation. Information is not transformation. You have to pull your weight. The good news is that you can do it.",1382400000,14,359,4.806451612903226
8574691,5,B00BWB7MK2,Perfect condition.,1502755200,,18,8.5
8574692,4,B00BWB7MK2,"I like this DVD.  I like the content even more.  There is a 12 minute TedTalk that I like better as it is faster moving and a 1 hour google talk that is also good.  And the book ""The Happiness Advantage"" discusses the research even more and is my favorite as it includes the Audible version so I could listen and drive.  I would still recommend this DVD as it's just 90 minutes but if you can do the book with the Audible, you'll get a lot more.",1484697600,,445,4.0227272727272725
8574693,5,B00BWB7MK2,One of the best motivational dvd's I have viewed.,1471564800,,49,4.555555555555555
8574694,2,B00BWB7MK2,"After we watched the TED talk on this subject, we ordered the The Happiness Advantage - Shawn Achor: DVD from a seller on Amazon.  We started watching it and noticed a significant difference in his tone and energy. This DVD presentation seemed on a ""Happiness High"" rather than the more professional presentation in the TED talk.  It seemed as if he had shifted from researcher to salesman.and the audience seemed keyed to react from before the program rather than react to the actual content.

We will give it to a thrift store, and perhaps someone will gain from it.  I would recommend the TED talk..",1460678400,3,602,4.704761904761905
8574695,5,B00BWB7MK2,The Happiness Advantage is amazing!!  I have already watched it 3 times!!!  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is searching for Happiness.  I absolutely love Shawn Anchor.,1447459200,,171,5.035714285714286
8574696,5,B00BWB7MK2,Excellent - plan to send it as a gift and use it with my teaching staff in the fall!,1435190400,,84,3.473684210526316
8574697,3,B00BWB7MK2,Not worth the $24. The main presentation lasts 1 hour and repeats everything he said in his TED talk but adds a few things.,1428710400,2,123,4.166666666666667
8574698,5,B00BWB7MK2,"A great video reviewing the main philosophies and strategies of of the book ""The Happiness Advantage.""  Shawn is an informative and entertaining speaker. I used this video to introduce all our fellow team members at work to Shawn's body of work.  We purchased both of his books for our work library. I highly recommend both his  books and this video.",1420848000,,350,4.8
8574699,5,B00BWB7MK2,"Good, easy tips based on science",1413763200,2,32,4.5
8574700,5,B00BWB7MK2,"I highly recommend this tape and everything else Shawn Achor has to offer to everyone!
I love watching this again, and again and again!  Highly recommended....",1409616000,4,159,5.115384615384615
