243606,3,6300189856,"Charles Bronson is a Secret Service Agent who is charged with protecting the acerbic First Lady ( Jill Ireland) Mr. Bronson is his usual self and for that I am grateful, loved this man and totally enjoyed all of his movies, Jill Ireland (whom I usually love) really was a petulant horror in this movie. Imagine a first lady behaving this way, She was totally hateable. I had not one care whether she was killed or not. Horrible person. Nevertheless, this is a cool movie with one of the coolest actors ever, and yes it is a Golan-Globus movie which means silly and ridiculous but you have to put up with that and the over the top nonsense, the cheesy building that they were having the gunfight in and the awful support extras.",1464998400,3,727,4.473684210526316
243607,3,6300189856,"Assassination stars Charles Bronson as Jay Killy Killion, chief Secret Service agent charged with protecting the new First Lady of the United States, Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland). Its a tough gig, since Lara is egotistical and high-maintenance. She becomes the target of an international terrorist group determined to kill her. Thinking that it may be an inside job, Killy takes her across the country to keep her out of harms way. The fact that they are discovered might mean that the President himself is involved.

Assassination doesnt provide the same punch as Bronsons Death Wish, made 13 years earlier. There is comical interplay among characters and far less concentration on the bad guys and their ruthlessness. Bronsons character projects a more sensitive, protective side than his vigilante in Death Wish, but Ms. Ireland is an unconvincing, one-note caricature. Director Peter Hunt doesnt help her much to make Lara resonate as something more than an abrasive, spoiled brat.

The PG-13 rating means that violence is toned down and the action sequences are fairly tame, especially the chase scenes, which lack inventiveness. If you're a Charles Bronson fan, youll probably see this movie anyway, though youll be getting a pale version of Bronsons more macho cinematic persona. Non-Bronson fans would do well to look elsewhere for action flicks.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1462233600,,1421,5.251101321585903

243655,5,6300189856,"As a moderate fan of Charles Bronson I've gotten several of his films on VHS and I've got some that I recorded off of television airings on various movie channels through the years. I've since been seeking DVD copies of those particular films I have on VHS and this one, from 1987 and titled ""Assassination"", is one of those.

This is the kind of action-adventure film that is quintessential Charles Bronson. You'll get a lot of explosions, gun fire, one-liners, and intrigue...and you also get a story that takes place in the political world circa the mid 1980s. Is there much difference from 1987 and 2015 as far as ""the political world"" goes...I'd say it's pretty much the same...except there's changes of faces/players every 2, 4, or 8 years depending on the elected office and of course the overwhelming impact of social media was lacking during the time period this film was made.

The story, basically, centers around a Secret Service Agent (Charles Bronson, playing Jay Killian). He's assigned to protect the First Lady (played by Bronson's spouse, Jill Ireland) during a tumultuous political climate involving relations with the Russians. Killian's under the impression that she may be abducted/held hostage during a potential Assassination attempt of her husband and so he's to protect her. She comes off clueless/naive about the element of danger circling around her and the President and so a lot of the time she's more of a thorn in Killian's side than a gracious First Lady.

It's later in the film that it become clear that there's some inside double dealings going on inside the Belt Way and things aren't exactly as they appear to be due to misinformation and deliberate staging of the daily news cycle and it's around this time Killian learns the real story behind his assignment.

The film, in my opinion, is a first rate production and the story entertaining in a larger-than-life fashion. This IS an action-adventure movie, by the way...I expect some over-the-top, entertaining action. As a side note, after ordering, I was expecting to get a DVD featuring the image of Charles in front of the burning riverboat but the copy I received is the other one sold under the ""The Best of Bronson"" line of releases and featuring a more extreme close-up of Charles on the DVD cover.

This movie is also a sentimental favorite. For it is this movie that I remember my grandparent's renting from a video store in the late '80s and it very ell could be the first time I had ever heard the name 'Charles Bronson'. Being born in 1976 would've made me 10, going on 11, during the first release of this movie in 1987. All that I know is my grandparent's jumped for joy (not literally...I'd remember THAT!) but they were thrilled to finally get to see the movie and from that moment on I'd been aware of Charles Bronson ever since. If this is your first experience seeing a Charles Bronson film then you'll be in for a treat. If you liked the action-adventure and the character driven performances then you're sure to like any number of his other movies. Seek out the Death Wish franchise first...there's 5 of those films available for purchase on Amazon.",1422748800,,3159,4.7889908256880735

243706,3,6300189856,"Assassination, 1987 film

There is a new administration in Washington. Secret Service will protect the First Lady. She rides in an open car, this is against the rules. A man on a motorcycle rides up, there is an explosion. Killian is ordered out of her car. The new President is sworn in. They identify the rider - an American terrorist who is a professional assassin! Killian was recently divorced. Mrs. Craig attends a press conference. A reporter from the National Gazette asks a personal question! They go to guard the First Lady. A man watches them. The First Lady goes to California for a vacation. She will sail to Catalina. Who is working on that boat? The conversation tells about the people. Killian must inspect the ship before Mrs. Craig sails. We learn the reason why! She is recalled to Washington DC. Killian spends time with a co-worker.

Mrs. Craig is a very difficult person. Killian says she is in danger from someone. There is a meeting. Someone stole rockets that are used to shoot down an airplane. This is a danger to a helicopter, so they transfer Mrs. Craig to an automobile for the trip. Rockets explode to provide action. The assassin speeds off on a motorcycle. That won't be necessary, Maam. Why was that young man killed? Killian will work surveillance now. [Those automobiles say product placement.] Who else is watching? Killian follows Mrs. Craig, she hides out. Will he help her? First, no telephone calls (they can listen in). A man shoots up their lodging, but fails in the end. Killian will stay with Mrs. Craig. They ride a Greyhound bus to Kokomo Indiana. Then they ride a motorbike (who would expect that?). Mrs. Craig explains how she helped Cal win the election. Would being a widower best help his re-election?

They hide the motorbikes and continue traveling on a train. Her name is Lara, from Laramie. There is an emergency stop, a helicopter lands to search the train. She called her husband! Now they hitchhike on a pick-up truck. A dune buggy allows cross-country travel. [Do those cars and prices date this movie?] A motorboat takes them across the lake to Laras father. But she called her father! Will there be an attack from the lake? Can the assassin be stopped? Killian uses his backup weapon as a last resort. The FBI meets Senator Bunsen. He died in his sleep. Killian decides he needs a change of scenery, hes going to Lake Tahoe to work for Laras father. [No mention of the type of work.]

This is an average film that could have been better, somehow. The chase reminds me of The 39 Steps or similar chase pictures. This story seems slightly incredible. Could the Establishment Press have kept Calvin Craigs secret? Not with the usual political conflicts (my assumption). There are often better candidates than any one man (or woman). The candidates are seen by many people in multiple states. But if 80% of the people are kept uninformed that could be good enough. Was this story inspired by any actual politician in the USA? Or elsewhere?",1384387200,,2997,4.735632183908046

243713,3,6300189856,"Preceding In The Line Of Fire (1993) by a number of years, Assassination (1987), also involves the White House security team, except the primary concern is not the chief executive, but the President's wife.  The film provides an opportunity for Charles Bronson (1921-2003) and his real life spouse Jill Ireland (1936-1990), to work together for the final time, as Bronson plays secret service agent Jay Killian, who along with his team, is tasked with seeing to the security of First Lady Lara Royce Craig, played by Ireland.  Solidly directed by veteran Peter Hunt (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Shout At The Devil), while not exactly an action/comedy, the level of realism isn't very high, as the independent and headstrong Craig, codenamed ""One Mother"", resents the presence of security, and Killian in particular.

Killian and Craig immediately get off on the wrong foot, as she receives a black eye during an incident during a parade.  Although a spoiled, flighty, and antagonistic First Lady might seem farfetched, watching Ireland and Bronson, who have acted together many times, is still enjoyable.  Their relationship begins to evolve after Killian saves the First Lady's life, and later as they find themselves running from those who want to kill her.  A relationship that doesn't seem to fit is a romance between Killian and his sexually liberated subordinate Charlotte ""Charlie"" Chong (Jan Gan Boyd), who is less than half his age.

At 66, Bronson can still easily handle a gun or rocket launcher, and while he is doubled in a motorcycle chase, Bronson tackles most of the stunts himself, including a speedboat chase.  Bronson and Ireland also do some motorcycle riding.  Unfortunately, the central story involving some silly scheme to maintain political power, is complete rubbish.  Even with a hero past retirement age, the amount of action is fairly decent, and might be enough to satisfy those with a mild craving for excitement.  Fans of either Charles Bronson or Jill Ireland, may appreciate seeing them together for the last time, as Ms. Ireland would sadly fall victim to cancer in 1990.

243742,2,6300189856,"Thankfully the last of Charles Bronson's co-starring vehicles with Jill Ireland, 1987's Assassination feels a bit like a second stab at Love and Bullets but with Bronson's cop now a secret service agent and Ireland's airheaded gangster's moll he's protecting from hitmen now the deeply unpleasant First Lady who's being targeted by a terrorist-for-hire to stop her ruining her husband's re-election prospects. It's all rather silly stuff even at a rushed 86 minutes - after an exploding motorcycle and a massive explosion destroying her yacht, Ireland still doesn't think someone wants to kill her - and director Peter Hunt's a long way from the glory days of OHMSS here (even his legendary editing skills can't hide the worst piece of stunt doubling of the 80s, where Bronson is suddenly replaced on an exploding motorbike by a Lee Horsley lookalike), but a more relaxed Bronson seems a bit more involved in proceedings than in most of his 80s films and shows a pleasingly light touch in his scenes with Jan Gan Boyd. Unnecessary, but a painless timefiller if you're in an undemanding mood.

Both are far superior to this movie, which features action scenes and assassination attempts that are as unbelievable as they are uninspired.

The script and dialouge stinks, the supporting cast was way below B grade and 'by the numbers' lame action scenes rehashed from Bronsons other films kill this one.  Even more sickening was the CONSTANT sexual innuendo dialogue between the elderly Mr. Bronson and Charly(?!?),his late 20's Asian assistant who is trying to get Bronson to sleep with her.

Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a bad Bronson flick as much as the next guy but this one is altogether unacceptable.  A dirtbike with a mini machine gun mounted on the handlebars? I'm surprised I haven't seen more mention of the cheesy CGI explosion matted in over the picture.  This movie makes Death Wish 5, Chino and Breakout look like a five star films.  I would really rather watch Kinjite again then to sit through this one twice.

Directed by Peter R. Hunt. Written by  Richard Sale.

Jay Killian (Charles Bronson) has returned to his job from a six-weeks sick leave. His first day back is Inauguration Day in Washington DC. He is the Chief of Police and his job today is to protect the new First Lady of the United States, Lara Craig (Jill Ireland), however, she tells him he has to obey her orders. Outside the White House, Killian rejects the open car for Mrs. Craig. They have not used an open car since 1963 when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.  Mrs. Craig thinks it is ridiculous and wants to ride the open car anyway. In the parade, with Killian sitting up front and his assistant Charlotte Chang (Jan Gan Boyd),  Mrs. Craig prefers to sit up and ride on top of the back seat so she can be seen and wave to the people. Killian tells her she should not sit up so high and he can pull her down. She continues to sit up there as proud as a peacock. A motorcycle cop drives up to the car, Killian gets suspicious. Suddenly the tire blows and the cop falls off. Killian grabs Mrs. Craig down and she bumps her eye near his knee. The motor of the motorcycle explodes. The cop escapes into the crowd. Mrs. Craig wants Killian to get out of the car and walk the rest of the way.
  The President (Charles Howerton) made it through the inauguration.
  Will there be another assassination attempt? You will have to watch the rest of the movie to find out.

Also in the cast: Stephen Elliott, Randy Brooks, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Michael Ansara, William Prince, Peter Lupus.

Charles Bronson was the age of 64 during filming.

Filmed in Washington DC, Los Angeles, California and Nevada.

In-film advertising: Chevron, Greyhound, Harley Davidson, Coca-Cola, KC.

This review is from the TGG Direct, LLC and MGM DVD release as a double feature with Messenger of Death (1988). My review for Messenger of Death (1988) is listed separately.

At the time of filming, President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were still in The White House.
On January 20, 1989, we saw Vice President, now President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush enter The White House as The Reagans left. It was the most easiest and friendliest transition you will ever see on Inauguration Day.",1476057600,,2345,4.605769230769231
