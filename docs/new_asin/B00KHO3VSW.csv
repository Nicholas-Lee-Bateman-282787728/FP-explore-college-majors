The story feels very rushed, this may be due to the 50 minute runtime or the complete chaos that is the story in this film. If you haven't read the manga you will be absolutely lost as to what is even going on in this movie. It is still a touching and humorous film on par with the rest of the series, I just feel this was a terrible way to end the series. There is a continuation of the story using the voice actors and the manga in the special features I believe this could have been animated and added to either this film or perhaps a new film but as of the time of this review I don't see anything on the horizon.",1469059200,5,777,3.9871794871794872
