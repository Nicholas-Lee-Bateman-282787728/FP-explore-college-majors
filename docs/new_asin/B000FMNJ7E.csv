2576521,5,B000FMNJ7E,Amother wonderful Gaither DVD.  I would highly recommend that lovers of gospel music add this one to their collection.  I am glad I did.,1304812800,,136,4.625
2576522,4,B000FMNJ7E,"This DVD is not a compilation of memorable clips like some of the other Gaither Series Concerts.  It is an actual concert in its entirety in front of an audience.  One of the great things about the tribute or special moments DVD collections is that you get to back in time if you wish.  Many of the veterans are here, including those who have left to see the Lord.  And if you treasure the Homecoming Concerts with the classic veterans, this is one to see.

Taped in 1996, the veterans include:  Jake Hess, James & Terry Blackwood, the Goodmans, Brock & Ben Speer, Eva Mae LeFevre, George Younce, The Martins, Sue Dodge, Janet Pascal, Rex Nelon, and Dottie Rambo, Gaither Vocal Band; Ivan Parker; Jimmy Jones; Babbie Mason, J.D. Sumner, Lilli Knauls, Jack Toney, etc,.  You will enjoy comedy with Mark Lowry sporting a Jake Hess Wig. You get the picture what a collection of old favorites are here.

With the taping in 1996, there seems to be something missing, but I can't place it.  Regardless, it is always good to sing along with the Homecoming Friends. Testimony is given by Donnie Sumner, J.D.'s nephew.

Some favorite songs include ""This Ole House"" by the Cathedrals, ""Suppertime"" by Jimmy Jones;  ""Sweetest Song I Know"" ""Palms of Victory""; ""The King is Coming"", a popular Gaither-written song;  There is talk about Albert Brumley, who wrote ""I'll Fly Away"";  ""Wait Til You See Me In My New Home""

One of my favorites songs is ""Oh Come Angel Band"" and the entire cast sings this, but it is soooo much better done with a couple of harmonies, such as on this CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homecoming/dp/B000005KUN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homecoming</a>, my favorite version.

God Rides on Wings of Love"";  When the Saints Go Marching In; ""Child of the King"";  The World is not My Home""  ""Ive Never Been This Homesick Before"", I Believe in the Old Time""; ""On the Sunny Banks"";  ""Leave it There"" etc.

This is enjoyable, just to see the many performers from the earlier days of Homecoming Concerts.....Rizzo",1273795200,13,2061,4.988269794721408

8124731,5,B000FMNJ7E,"We were delighted to get this 1996 Gaither DVD 'Moments to Remember.' I love the mix of the good old Gospel with superb harmony, joyful singing and absolute sincerity in presentation and expression.  The old saying, ""Jesus is the joy germ"" is certainly exemplified here. These singers really do give the Lord Jesus credit for His blessing and love. Wonderful!

As usual, the DVD arrived here in New Zealand ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.",1355529600,2,450,4.907894736842105
