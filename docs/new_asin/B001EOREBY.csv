8299194,5,B001EOREBY,Good product for learning beginning Spanish. My daughter has enjoyed the variety offered by this dvd. She watches it very often and points at the objects when she sees them at home. She has learnt words successfully by watching the dvd. I like the pace at which the objects are displayed. Many objects with their Spanish and English Translation are shown. Nice dvd.,1439769600,,365,4.809523809523809

8299197,5,B001EOREBY,"Preschooler Learns Spanish from Galloping Minds is an excellent educational DVD for toddlers all the way up to kindergarten. This DVD does a wonderful job at introducing your child to the Spanish language. It covers all the fundamentals that are necessary for your child to begin learning Spanish and it even goes beyond the basics.

I watched the DVD with my son and there were many words that I had never even been taught when I took Spanish 1 and 2 in high school. It's like giving your child a crash course in Spanish. At this age children can learn and retain a new language much easier than if they wait until they are older. This DVD would be a great first step to preparing your child for school. I live in Florida where it is necessary to know basic Spanish just to get through the day. My son will no doubt need to learn Spanish as a second language in order to get a job here when he grows up. That is why I am introducing it to him now, the earlier the better.

The DVD begins with teaching words associated with family members then it goes on to teach foods and animals. A picture or video of the object that is being translated is shown along with the word spoken and written in English and in Spanish. Not only do they teach the words but they also use them in sentences so that your child can get a real feel for the language and how it sounds. I really liked the animals section because it showed some beautiful footage of all types of animals up close. My son enjoyed this part very much as well. The other subjects that the DVD covers in Spanish are action words, means of transportation, numbers and colors, parts of the body and everyday objects.

The 36 minute long DVD kept my son's full attention throughout the whole film. After the DVD was over I noticed that he absorbed the information because I overheard him calling our cat ""gato"" and counting to ten in Spanish. I am going to let him watch the DVD every day and I believe he will learn more and more each time. There are a ton of words for him to learn on this DVD. Don't think that it just teaches cat, dog, boy and girl because it actually goes way beyond the basics. Your child will be able to handle it and he/she will surely surprise you with all they have learned. The DVD suggests that it is appropriate for toddlers and preschoolers but I believe that it would also benefit children that are a bit older. Overall, I would give this DVD 5 stars out of 5 and I'd recommend it to any parent who has young children.",1273795200,8,2500,4.2923728813559325
8299198,1,B001EOREBY,"I ordered two other Dvds with this one and Brainy Baby-Spanish was the best.  It kept my 23 month old engaged, while 123 Cuentame un Cuento is a bit advanced and Galloping Minds -- I did not care for at all -- anyone can hold up flash cards!  In any event, Brainy Baby-Spanish was worth the buy.  I am a spanish speaking mother who wanted to find a good product for my daughter while I am at work so she may study the language while she is at home since my sitter only speaks limited spanish.  Thank you Brainy Baby!",1260230400,3,516,4.13
8299199,2,B001EOREBY,This product is very dated and won't hold the attention of a small child.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.,1241049600,,110,4.7894736842105265
