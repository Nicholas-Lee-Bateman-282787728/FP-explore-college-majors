3574331,4,B001FB5634,"The Road is based on a Pulitzer winning novel by an American writer Cormac McCarthy (2006). The story is simple:

Almost all vegetation as well as animal and human life on Earth have been extinguished by a mysterious cataclysm. It has been years since governments and society collapsed. With no renewable food sources, the few survivours have turned to cannibalism, and violence has become a way of life. Amidst this desperation, a bedraggled man and his young son are traveling south. The father is trying to find a future for the boy. Their journey is the subject of the film.

I am happy to report that The Road is NOT another Hollywood version of an action packed apocalypse. No zombies need make an appearance, for most human survivours are far scarier... It is a film frightening in its realism, well written and superbly acted. It is also highly depressing and as hauntingly disturbing as a film can get. If you choose to see it (and I highly recommend you do), make sure you prepare yourself mentally beforehand. To illustrate: after the screening, my viewing companion and I proceeded to dinner which, uncharacteristically, we consumed in almost a complete silence, our emotions still firmly tethered to the story we had just seen.

To those who have read and admire the novel: I believe you will be pleasantly surprised by the respectful treatment the original text has received. The four star rating I have given the film is strictly due to its ending. It felt somewhat rushed and stuck on. In the novel, it is clear that the ending should not be taken at face value. In the film, the possible duality of the ending is not as clearly suggested.

Still, great stuff! (watch out for cameos from Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce)",1261872000,2,1733,4.74750830564784
3574332,5,B001FB5634,"""The Road""(2009) is directed by John Hillcoat (The Proposition), and is based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. ""The Road"" is a grim tale that follows a father (Viggo Mortensen) and his son across a devastated landscape after some undisclosed calamity. As they are trying to make there way to the western coast of the U.S. they come across remnants of humanity. There is talk of cannibalism and other atrocities as people have been reduced to scavenging for bare necessities. The movie is exceedingly bleak, and grey. There is no life to speak of. We don't see birds, or any animals, only rag tag groups of people, some who viciously exploit any humans that they run across. It is a harrowing tale of the bond between a father and son as they cling to their humanity and  their precarious existence.",1261699200,,815,4.659722222222222
3574333,5,B001FB5634,"The Road is a bleak and mournful film, and given this one may ask why seeing such a film is even necessary. I asked myself this very question as I drove home to my family after seeing it. Why bother with a film like this? Why put oneself through such a bleak experience? I concluded that it is well worth seeing and the answer, I think, lies in the emotion and the universal truths that the film explores.

Most films we see have a a struggle in them. Almost all of them present at least a challenge to the characters involved. Many of our films today are bleak, but we have become used to the level or bar that was set long ago. We watch films about war, super villains bent on destruction, fantasies about horrible evil destroying good and pleasant people, cop dramas about criminals, mob films about criminals, sci-fi films about man and his destructive nature and on and on and on. We tend to not walk out of the theater thinking we just watched a bleak film because we have become used to a certain norm with established highs and lows. With a film like The Road the normal bottom has been ripped out and we experience the film through a dark cinematic cellar rarely seen in in American films these days. This film reminds me a bit in tone to Russian films like The Return, and Stalker. Now while those films are not exactly feel good films either, they do show us the human condition stripped down. When challenged the hardest we show our humanity the most.

The Road speaks partially to me because of it's American sensibilities. We live in such a cluttered society here filled with all the most useless crap and trivial distractions and we often forget the few basics, the core, of who we are as a people. The Road is a metaphorical desert island and the father and son wandering through it have taken with them the last few absolute necessary moral basics that make up who and what we are here in America as a good and basic people. Even that moral core gets muddled in the father as he protects his son through the wasted landscape that has become populated, mostly, by cannibalistic survivors. The father seeks to protect the sons purity and goodness from evil and deliver them somewhere safe. Throughout their southern trek towards a hopeful warmth with no real clear destination the father nearly crosses the line or ""the road"" himself to the other side while thinking mostly, narrow-mindedly, only of his son and his purity. The son sees this moral lapse in the father and reminds him to stay on course and not get lost like the bad people have.

Do the cannibals represent that aspect of society that often eat society alive today? Do they represent serial killers, mass shooters, child predators, drug dealers, child pornographers, corrupt scammers and tarnished souls that we see every day as the news unfolds? It may sound crazy but the film is most certainly not just about a dad protecting his boy, but rather a film about the very basics of what constitutes good and evil, i.e. the good people and the bad people.

The idea of being eaten by another human has become a film genre all its own in the entirely whimsical zombie films of our times. While most may dismiss such zombie films as just another distraction, I suspect that zombie films represent a deep rooted fear of modern society that has nonchalantly bubbled to the surface in our pop culture. Cormac McCarthy explores our fears realistically at their very core. The idea that someday this structured society  we take for granted all around us will collapse, and that the worst elements of ourselves will be forced or driven out of basic necessity for sustenance to cannibalize what is left and eat one another is explored and depicted at it's very root here in The Road. Because it is so bleak, and because it is so frighteningly honest, like a horrible nightmare dredged up from our deeps psyches, we are compelled to not enjoy such a film. Certainly it can not be enjoyed as such traditional fun distractions in cinema can but at the same time a bleak film such as this is all at once moving, emotional, and points a positive candle through the worst muck that humanity can be. Although rough to watch and not easy to stomach I came out of The Road reminded of the very basics that are important. Not many films do that any more.

The Road also explores the soul, the afterlife, God, and the basic question as to whether or not absolute good does truly exist in this universe as a fundamental property, or is it just in fact something we made up like bluejeans, soda pop and nail polish. I came away from The Road being reminded that in fact, yes, those fundamental things such as he soul, the afterlife, and God do all exist. They make up our core as a people whether we all believe in them or not and they must be recognized by those who care to see them. We must be reminded of them even if we do not entirely understand them. It's similar to complex math, the language of the universe. Humans discovered it, we all know it exists, although many of us do not entirely understand it, we are still aware of its importance and understand what it has given us as a species. Concepts like God, the soul, and good and evil are certainly not tangible nor quantifiable in any traditional sense but The Road seeks to do so anyway and succeeds admirably I think.",1261612800,5,5340,4.517063081695967
3574334,4,B001FB5634,"The one thing that The Road does well is the same thing that may divide audiences on this film--sticking to its source material. If you're familiar with the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, you'll know that it may have raised some eyebrows when it was announced it was being made into a film. However after the immense critical and commercial and success of the Coen brother's adaptation of his novel No Country for Old Men, it's no wonder that it would eventually make its way to the big-screen sooner or later.

  The film follows a father and his son on their journey through a post-apocalyptic world. They have no mission other than to survive, or ""carry on the fire inside"" as the father repeatedly tells his son. Little is told of the events that have caused this worldwide catastrophe. There are few characters in the book and the ones that do appear have little depth to them, making it an even more difficult task for director John Hillcoat. What the film really centers on, and why the book rendered so well with readers, is the relationship between father and son, and its examination of just how far a parent will go to protect their child in the most grim and hopeless of circumstances.

  The film's biggest strength is the incredible performance of Viggo Mortenson (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises) as a father who goes to unspeakable lengths to protect his son (Kodi Smith-McPhee) and carry them both through a bleak and desolate world. His son was born during this tumultuous time, so this world around him is the only thing he knows. His father steers clear of telling him what caused all of this and solely focuses on teaching him how to survive by being one of the ""good guys"". They are on a constant journey for food and shelter, of which there is little left. The ""bad guys"", as the father puts it, are some of the few survivors who have turned to rape, murder, and cannibalism as a means to carry on in this world. One of the most frightening and chilling moments of this movie are when the father has to tell his son how to hold a gun to kill himself in case they ever are attacked by any of the outlaws that roam the countryside. It hits the viewer square in the gut and makes the question the lengths they would go to protect their child from harm in the worst of circumstances.

  While the film may be no masterpiece, Mortenson's portrayal of a father willing to do next to anything to protect his son from the unspeakable danger surrounding them is nothing short of brilliant. Cormac McCarthy's novels may not render themselves well from book to movie, but its tough to argue that a much better job could be done than this.

3574335,2,B001FB5634,"Despite the drama, heaertbreak and hope conveyed by the novel on which it is based, this film is a laborious, repetitive one-note story rendered clausterphobic by the fact that nearly all of the screen time is taken up by the same two characters. Additionally, the ""Father"" tends to mumble and swallow his words which makes it even less appealing.  If you've already read the book and remember the ending, this movie is probably not going to work for you.",1260057600,6,455,4.7594936708860756

Fortunately, the film respected it's source material and contains one powerful visual after the next.  The film is perfectly cast, very well acted, and adequately written.  When you have such a descriptive book as ""The Road"", it's hard to capture everything - and the film does a good job but doesn't completely succeed.  Without spoiling the ending, I will just say I think the emotional sting the book leaves is better than the film.  This is also such a dark film I think those not familiar with the source material might find it too dark and depressing.  It's certainly not for everyone, but for fans of the book, it's a nice companion.",1259539200,27,961,5.927536231884058
3574338,5,B001FB5634,"**WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD**
  ""The Road"" is a powerful movie about the love of a man for his son. Viggo Mortensen's character is a simple man who shows unconditional affection for the boy he has vowed to protect. This emotional core is what sustains the film through times of absolute despair. The physical landscape is like a roadmap of purgatory: bridges have collapsed, mushrooms of smoke billow into the sky, earthquakes cleave fissures in the ground so trees snap and fall like matchsticks, and raging orange infernos consume woodlands, as if a glimpse of Hell is just beyond the horizon. Everything is grey and bleached of color, seen through a skein of ash. At times it seems as if you're watching black and white documentary footage; that's how stark and grainy this world is. All vibrancy and beauty have been scorched away by an apocalyptic cataclysm of global proportions.
  The world has been stripped of all joy, like a corpse gnawed to the bone by rot. The only pleasure that remains is finding a hidden stash of food or the simple comfort of human contact. Hope is largely absent, so it must be manufactured.
  The movie is permeated with doom. Never have I witnessed a story so bleak, and yet the dread is palpable. One cringes when the boy sits on a chair swing and it creaks, potentially drawing the attention of cannibals who lurk on the periphery like brutal phantoms to plunder survivors of their innocence. Viggo Mortensen is a coiled spring of single-minded determination: save the boy at all costs. This survivalist mentality has made him paranoid, which is realistic in a world where people have been reduced to predators. All he wants is to secure food, warmth, and shelter for his charge. The unforgiving landscape challenges him at every juncture.
  The boy (Kodi McPhee) is in a state of fearful vigilance. His youth has allowed him to retain a strong sense of right and wrong in a world that has been leached of morals. He hasn't grown jaded yet, and doesn't want to. His generosity and kindness are probably what keep his father from descending into a vengeful, feral torpor. The boy is his conscience, reminding him of when people were civil with one another. It is a performance of amazing potency: several scenes are stunning in Kodi's ability to convey raw emotion. Even though acts of cruelty are commonplace, the boy fights for decency, making him instantly sympathetic. A part where the boy is stunned by a gunshot and goes catatonic while his father hauls him away and picks brain matter out of his hair is rendingly powerful.
  The movie raises difficult questions. Would it be more noble to commit suicide than to succumb to the clutches of a stranger? Is trudging down a desolate road toward the unknown a better alternative than staying in one place? If one wants to survive at all costs, is it mandatory to become as grim and cruel as your surroundings? Or is showing compassion what ultimately separates humans from animals?
  The end is a test in endurance. Death looms near. The boy has to make an impossible choice. He wanders down the gloomy shoreline and sees a man. Is he an apparition? A hallucination? A mental distillation of all his hopes and fears? Everything the boy craves appears on the beach: a man, a woman, two children, and a dog. Is this a vision brought on by malnutrition and fever? The woman bends down and caresses his cheek, saying, ""I've been waiting for you"". Is the boy actually lying next to his father, in a fetal position, fantasizing what he wishes would materialize? Is he willing himself to die? All I can say is that I was profoundly affected. All the hardships endured seemed to mean nothing on that tiny stretch of sand near a grey, frigid ocean. And yet it wasn't the destination that mattered, it was the road they travelled to get there.",1259280000,5,3821,4.7293233082706765

In that setting the bleak atmosphere and palpable sense of dread (not to mention cannibals) made it a real nail-biter. I had not read the excellent book yet. I rectified this situation earlier this year, and while reading I was struck by how closely the scenes I remembered from the movie matched what I was reading. The book resonated with me more deeply due to being astoundingly well-written and more reflective than the film. Typically this is the case - most often the book is better.

I just re-watched the film. Just as I had remembered, the movie is almost scene-for-scene from the book. Much of the sense of dread was missing this time around, since I knew everything that was going to happen. It is still a very good adaptation, but I could see this not coming across as well to someone who hasn't read the novel. The book is the best way to experience this story, however, if you want to visualize what you've read (mostly, if you want to see Viggo Mortensen perfectly fit the role of the father, so you can picture him upon subsequent readings) this movie accomplishes that so unobtrusively that it's hard to believe it's a Hollywood production.",1501718400,3,1221,4.626728110599078

3574921,3,B001FB5634,"Cormac McCartth'y's ""The Road"" is one of the Great Books of the last 200 years and I have argued that it belongs in The Bible at the very end.

The movie is worth watching but it can't match McCarthy's taciturn prose about an undefined disaster which leaves the world virtually uninhabitable.

To me, the book presents the ultimate paradox in a way I've never seen it presented before:  How does one continue to live when there is nothing to hope for, nor no hope that there will ever be anything to hope for?

Long before this movie was made I had a friend who suggested that adapting this book to film in faithful form would have involved a kind of ""pornography.""

In my opinion only one film maker, the late Andre Tarkovsky, could have done it full justice and I strongly expect he would have filmed it in black and white.

Definitely worth watching, but the book is a jaw dropping masterpiece of the highest order.",1486339200,3,918,4.5

This boy grows up in this cutthroat apocalyptic wasteland, and at about 10 years old he hasn't learned a thing about how to survive. He has the attitude of a kid raised in a plush home in the suburbs. So soft an innocent, and i suppose the message of the movie is that innocence is a virtue?

Some incredibly horrifying but necessary moments which I wouldn't recommend for children under 12 and those over 12 should be supervised by adults who can explain the context.  The only flaw of consequence was the choice of the boy, he was too old for the role, not his fault, but a boy that age wouldn't need to be coddled in that way.  The soundtrack is a stroke of genius.  My son and I were incredibly moved.  Encourages discussion that's for sure.

3575811,3,B001FB5634,"Fear, hunger, emptiness, and danger are only some of the aspects that characterize this movie. Along with these aspects, and the combination of a darkened world and eerie music, you cannot help but feel the pain of those wondering through the desolate world that is earth. Each day is another challenge for the people in this apocalyptic world because they are constantly scavenging for food, clothes, and survival tools all while escaping the horror and possible death that awaits for them at every turn.
  Right from the beginning the movie pulled me in because of multiple things: The music, the settings, the casting, and the sorrow. All four of these aspects played a crucial role in the movie. Without the music, the dangerous and nerve racking moments would not be as influential on the audiences reactions. The setting in this movie is fairly modern with the rubble of buildings that used to line the sky, piles of trees that used to rise from the earth, and dark water that used to reflect the bright light of the sun. Because of this, the movie gives off a warning vibe that says this can happen to us. While some of the scenes were unfortunately castedSPOILER ALERT the only black man in the movie being a robber, overall the cast was chosen very well. Both the man and the boy played their roles just like you would imagine them in the book: skinny, eyes full of sadness, but also a little bit of hope within the eyes of the man. The sorrow plays into the emotions of those watching the movie by forcing them to empathize for the characters.
  Overall, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow-paced ""apocalyptic"" movie with some twists and turns.",1463529600,2,1689,4.657718120805369
3575812,3,B001FB5634,"The Road is a movie directed by John Hillcoat based on a novel of the same name written by Cormac McCarthy. I feel that this movie is a pretty good adaptation of the novel as it manages to maintain the same feeling given off by the book. However, they are some major differences between the book and the film. One major difference is the lack of overbearing darkness. In the book the sun was blotted out and the world is described as extremely dark with the characters often times struggling to see as it was so dark. While I can understand Hillcoats reason for not incorporating this fact, as it would make it very difficult to see anything in the darkness, it kind of removes the dreariness from the story. Another major differences between the two is the lack of snow in the film. Throughout the novel the threat of the cold and snow is brought up many times such as when the Man and the Boy are covering themselves up to avoid the rain and the Man states that if they got wet they would never get dry because the extreme cold would kill them. Another difference that is somewhat minor is the fact that in the movie the Man holds on to his lighter after dashing back up the ladder to get out of the basement where the cannibals kept their meat slaves. I believe that Hillcoat decided to do this order to have a physical manifestation of the flame that the Man says that the Boy is carrying, which is the existence of one still innocent and pure and that maintains the values of the old world. Something else that I noticed is that the events in the movie are in a different order than the events in the book. This works out however, as the events in the book are interrupted by times of boring wandering so the events will still flow as the parts between them are similar. In conclusion I personally enjoyed the movie more than I liked the book, because of its faster pace and its work to enforce the importance of family by including the mother more.",1463529600,,1954,4.3561643835616435

3575915,4,B001FB5634,"Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Road, is brought to the big screen through the artistry of John Hillcoat. Usually when thinking of a book turned into a movie, you find as though the movie had not done the book justice. However, Hillcoat did a great job with the film given the material he had to work with. There was a lot of room for him to do what he wanted considering that there wasn't really a plot to the story and it more just followed a stream of consciousness. Because of this, the story wasn't in the same order as it was in the book but it still worked out for the benefit of the viewer. The film did a good job of portraying this desolate wasteland that McCarthy had described exstensively with every scene having its own unique depiction of a wounded world. At this point you may think I have no problems with this flick but you would be wrong. There were a few things that didn't sit well with me. First being that even though there was an element of natural dangers, the movie had 0 scenes with snow in them. This may sound insignificant but if you read the book, snow was present during most of the man and the boy's trip and the lack of this element didn't quite give their journey that same feel of overal pity you had for them in that situation. Second, there was more of a disconnect beginning to form between the man and the boy in the book which hadn't been addressed as formally as I would have liked. I blame Hillcoat; not necessarily because it's his fault, but because someone needs to be blamed and it's certainly not the makeup artist (who did an amazing job by the way). Lastly the darkness that seemed to be almost perpetual in the book also wasn't emphasized as much as I would have liked it to be. All in all I give this movie a 9 out of 10 and would recommend you watch if you enjoyed the book or if you just happen to be into post apocalyptic dystopian films. Either way this isn't a bad movie to add to your collection.",1463356800,,1974,4.280748663101604
3575916,4,B001FB5634,"I enjoyed this movie. My biggest problem with the book it was based on was the huge amount of wasted time and repetitive and needless events, and when making a movie, naturally a lot of stuff from the book gets left out. This worked out to the films advantage, since the removal of dead air made it a much more palatable version of the (shockingly) award winning book.
Not only was the book in first person, but it was in a stream of consciousness style, which I can only imagine made it very difficult for the screenplay writer to translate into film. They did so quite well, and through dark colors, a desolate setting and incredible makeup, capturing the dark, dreary, frightening world these characters are traveling through.
The screenwriter picked and chose what they put in the film, and they chose to leave out all the points in the book which demonstrate the boy growing up and almost rebelling against his father, which I feel was likely done to make the ending much more dramatic. It ended up being a good choice on their part, because I didn't feel like this impacted the overall plot, but it did greatly improve the end.
While I cant give input as to whether or not it is worth watching if you loved the book, for anyone who has yet to read The Road, or who did not enjoy it like I did, I highly recommend this film.",1463270400,,1329,4.428571428571429

3575996,5,B001FB5634,"One of those films that leaves me puzzled about critics and where their heads are at. The Road gets mixed reviews on RT.  I gave it a shot anyway, figuring the source material is so strong and Cormac McCarthy's inherently cinematic novel lent itself so easily to a film adaptation, it would be kinda hard to screw up. The Road exceeded my expectations that were biased by a mixed critical and audience consensus.  Yes, the brilliantly written book is ultimately more impactful (though I did find the kid less annoying in the film), but this is a moving and very solid adaptation.  In fact, I don't think it could have been executed any better.  The performances, direction, art direction, cinematography, editing, sound, and effects -- all top notch.  Also, in lesser hands, this could have been an overlong three hour repetitive bore, which was my fear.  It isn't.  It has just the right run time clocking in under two hours -- nice and tight. Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee are pitch perfect.  The always excellent and beautiful Charlize Theron is terrific in her brief supporting role. Robert Duvall is unrecognizable, but gives a staggering performance in a small part that's little more than a cameo. However, it's his scene by the fire that is etched in my mind. Phenomenal. It shows you what a great actors can do with even a modest role.  I gave this five stars because it's right up with the original Night of the Living Dead as a seminal film of the post-apocalyptic sub-genre.  Really, they're the two best, clearly.  Any critic that gave this a thumbs down needs to go back to school and take remedial film appreciation courses.  The Road is a tragically underrated and overlooked film.  It is simultaneously dream-like while serving up the most realistic and nightmarish post-apocalyptic vision just like Cormac McCarthy's classic novel. Hats off to the talented production crew, writers, and actors who pulled it off.",1460678400,,1937,4.886850152905199

3576255,5,B001FB5634,"This movie is something I can't quite describe. It's dark, it's bleak...it will possibly leave you feeling dead inside by the end. Through this film (and the book, of course), we see the true depths of human nature. Those who think this that this movie is too dark or too bleak or too whatever this movie is, I'm sorry, but I have to disagree. This movie challenges us. It's painful to watch because we can't deny that at our cores, this is what we are. We are instinctual creatures, particularly when faced with situations that force us to act to survive, or suffer the consequences (in this scenario, death). It's a disturbing movie. The unnamed man and his son walk seemingly forever. They are determined to remain good. They are determined to never go down the path of cannibalism. I am convinced that those who think this is not a realistic portrayal of humanity simply are in denial. There are multiple scenarios in real life where humans have been faced with this: eat another human, or die. There are gruesome moments in this movie. There are glimmers of hope, but they are fleeting. The ending is bittersweet. But ultimately, you know the truth: no one can survive in this world (or at least, that's my interpretation). Post-apocalyptic scenarios are always interesting. Most I find are not realistic, at least the manner in which the apocalypse has happened. This one, regardless of if it could ACTUALLY happen or not, feels the most real. Throughout the movie, I am scared for these people and ultimately, myself. Because it's not so far fetched that it could never happen. It gives you a good perspective on all aspects of survival in this situation: family, death, birth, food, water, safety.

The acting and directing in this are beautiful. As someone who has read the book, I could not have asked for a better movie version. Some of the details that are added from the books may have seemed mundane, but I appreciate every single one (e.g., the blind man's shoe lace color). I feel like you have to view this movie (and read the book) knowing that it does not let up. It is sad. It is painful to watch. Our brains want a story that ends well to give us hope. While this one somewhat ends that way, it does not make up for the reality of the characters' situation.

Easily one of my favorite movies. I can't rave enough about it. But I also completely understand why some people don't like it--depressing movies with no resolve are not everyone's thing, and that's fine. But at least give the movie a chance and try to not be too turned off from it just because it is depressing.",1452384000,,2593,4.598272138228942

A lot of people are getting feelings of scary days ahead and I think this movie best shows what very well could be what lies in our near future! Most of all, it doesn't glamorize apocalypse scenarios like movies such as the Book off Eli does but shows real human suffering as a result of there being no food or water to speak of.

3576437,3,B001FB5634,"Even in the end, there wasn't a hope spot in this movie. It was the bleakest movie I've ever watched, and I've seen several that left you cold after watching. The setting is both stunning and aggravating -- how are there so many humans that they can be farmed for food, but not a single deer, raccoon, crow, or squirrel? The story, similarly, is stunning and aggravating; the characters behave very strangely (perhaps because they are so hungry). The end is ambiguous -- it's possibly important that the man is missing his thumbs, same as the fellow they just left to die of hypothermia. The acting is full of stunning moments, but in general, everyone is chewing the scenery.

If you have depression, anxiety, or a tendency to hoard -- don't watch this film. If you need a good cry to come out..... this might be the ticket.",1446249600,,825,4.574324324324325

Also, a lot of the really scary scenes in the book were sorta ""meh"" for me -- I couldn't imagine them dark/scary enough, so I could only intellectually acknowledge that the characters should have been scared, but I didn't *feel* it myself.  In the movie, I did feel it.  I felt the danger, the conflict, the fear.  The child actor has a great moment in this movie, too, where he stands up to his father, shouting and asserting himself.

3576578,5,B001FB5634,"No question about it:  This was a stellar film with stellar acting and a credible environment in which the characters were forced to operate.  Although filmed and released before then, every aspect of this movie reminded me The Last of Us on the PS3 and Xbox 360.  Here are some areas I found interesting.

ACTING

Again, superb from everyone.  The only superstar here was Charlize Theron, and she doesn't get much screen time other than serving as a tool to show how the son and father are in the place they are now.  This is a good thing, though.  Her being in this type of world would have been hard to believe.  After all, she's Charlize Theron, a well-known, acclaimed actor.  I don't think people would be able to put that aside to see a woman in desperation and struggling to keep her family alive.

The gentleman who plays the father encapsulates everything that you would expect of a father in a post-apocalyptic world who has the responsibility of ensuring his progeny can lead a full life, or, at the very least, can make it to adulthood.  He's grungy but can't do anything about it, so he makes do with what's he got with him, and what he can find scavenging.

He's not a complainer and doesn't tolerate his child doing so, either.  He's a scrapper, just a reluctant one, probably because he's never had to scrap his entire life.  He credibly faces a host of foes set out kill him and eat or abduct his son.  He meets some good people that he can never fully trust because he knows that letting his guard down can mean his and his son's doom.  So he moves on, day to day, minute to minute.  There is no planning; there is just surviving.  There's only the concern of taking care of his boy.

The son is a real standout.  He plays a confused, nave child well.  In a land of desperation, he is the sole source of positivity and hope.  He believes in the inherent good in people.  He believes in trusting people until they give you a reason not to.  He believes in helping people even when it means that he may be negatively affected.  In those senses, he's both mature and immature, and he balances these descriptors perfectly.

Like his father, he's grungy and persistently hungry.  He follows his father from place to place, inquisitive the entire time.  He's a handsome young man who has a great career of acting ahead of him if he keeps this up.

SCENERY

Frightful.  It's what you'd expect when you are at the end of days.  Everything is dreary due to years of misuse or destruction.  There's refuse everywhere.  Cars are burning; buildings are in ruins.  The road upon which the central characters travel is weary, tired, barely able to hold the weight of anyone else--but it does.

Everything around you tells you that you are silly for even daring to hope for a better tomorrow.  But that's the point.  This isn't a film with a neat dnouement.  The ending is sad, depressing, but that's the only thing that it could be.

I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested to see love and parental bonds shine through the darkness that is the world at that time.  The father's love for his son is abundant, ever-lasting, even in death.  The son's love for his father is unsurpassed, even when he's got to live with another family.  What a wonderful work of art.",1439769600,,3283,4.491525423728813

The movie's basic plot (no spoilers) is the attempt at survival in a post-apocalyptic world by a man and his son.  As a viewer you are shown flashbacks that allow you to guess at the nature of the apocalypse, but that is not what is important.  What IS important is the desperate determination shown by the father in protecting his son and the lengths that he goes to in order to do so.

Initially, I was depressed, badly, for about three days after this movie.  The situation was so utterly hopeless at first viewing. But as time has gone on, I've read more and more into the basic plot line, into the amazing ability of the boy, who never knew the pre-apocalyptic world, to find hope and joy in what seems a horrible mockery of everything that was good to his father and to the viewer.

Finally I just stopped watching after they got to the coast and later the father ordered a man to take even his clothing off out of a sense of justice he wanted to teach his son. I wish there would have been an element of trust in a ""higher power"" displayed. Was sort of expecting it from Robert Duval. Because even in the worst of events I find it impossible to believe people would be so animalistic (like in Lord of the Flies)... but the writer and director had a particular aim and probably at least achieved it.

Pros:  Provides an accurate glimpse of what life would look like after a natural apocalyptic event.  It's gritty, nasty, dirty, and every day you live on the edge of surviving.  Accuracy is a big thing for me, so I valued that in this movie.

Cons:  ""Papa"",  ""Papa"".  The whiney little kid.  I understand he got a raw deal in life, being born at the cusp of the end of the world as we know it, but he could complain just a little less.  Also, would it have killed Cormac McCarthy (or the movie writers) to just TELL us what the apocalyptic even was?  That's a pet peeve of mine--starting the story after some unnamed and unexplained event that changed the course of life and civilization when it would be just as simple to give even the most basic of explanations.  One might assume it was a war of some sort, or nuclear bombs, but I like to think it was a meteor due to the seeming lack of nuclear fallout.  So there you go.  If you watch this, just assume a giant meteor hit North America, kicked up dust and debris, killed off the plant life, and that's your apocalyptic event.",1428278400,5,1116,4.3707317073170735

3576948,4,B001FB5634,"The Road is based on the award winning novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy and a mostly faithful production to the book.

The film is a rather deep and bleak look at the main characters in the form of father and son Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPheem both of whom have no actual names but are simply credited as ""man and boy"" respectively. This is a story of survival for the two, and how they cope with the aftermath of the disaster. There are no real answers given as to why civilisation has collapsed or why there are some ""survivors"" the film explores their journey and ultimately their quest for simple survival.

There are few other cast members, Charlize Theron is featured in flashbacks as the ""man's wife"", Robert Duvall plays and old man by the name of ""Ely"" the only name given during the entire film. Later in the film Guy Pearce and Molly Parker have minor roles the cast is small and concentrates mostly on the father and son.

Story wise it's really showing the journey of the two lead cast members ""man and boy"" this doesn't sound too exciting but they have numerous struggles, and some encounters with other survivors. Directed by John Hillcoat the film certainly excels in the moody and desperate/barren scenes conveying a collapse of society and a barren bleak landscape.

Both of the lead actors do an outstanding job of portraying their roles, not just in terms of the script but there are moments of little conversation and an air of despondency in the acting which isn't an easy thing to do. Sometimes just the facial expressions and tone of voice add significantly to the feel of the film. I found the ending quite good (don't expect a super happy conclusion a small tiny bit of optimism is there), but it's a film which isn't comfortable to watch at times it successfully pulls you into the no hope world the two find themselves in. Not a film to play if you're in an upbeat mood The Road makes no real attempt to lift the viewer it can at times be very heavy viewing.

Quite an unusual film in may ways credit to the team overall the atmosphere is right on the mark. This isn't a film all viewers will enjoy but I can't really fault the experience and story.

3577054,4,B001FB5634,"First off let me say that I have in fact read the Cormac McCarthy book of the same name that this film is based on and adored it so I feel that I am appropriately informed to critique the movie. Don't worry, this will be a good review because at the end of the book and the movie my eyes were full of tears and it wasn't because either was poorly done. While the book may have been more effective I have to say that the movie, directed by Australia John Hillcoat, could hardly have been more accurate. That is a testament to both the book and the director. I'll get back to this.

If I were to pick an actor to play the central (unnamed) character I would never have found a better one than Viggo Mortensen. Most people are familiar with him whether he is playing a handsome hero like Aragon in the Lord of the Rings or an average man out to avenge his family in A History of Violence. In general I make an immediate connection with the actor in his movies. Maybe because in one way he actually isn't so handsome as to make him a pretty Hollywood boy but at the same time there is something other than his great acting chops and jaw line that makes him worth watching. The other main character is his son, about 10yrs old I would think. I can't say that he did a great job since his job was to object to the father's ""do anything to save my son"" tactics, cry on command, and rave about Coke, DelMonte pears, and Cheetos when they find them. However you do somehow feel his loss of his mother that he has no memory of and his desire above all else to have someone his age to be with, again something that he has no experience with. The idea is that a child is a child and certain things...love of a mother and playing with friends are not learned things but part of what they are born with. The flip side is that a father at the simplest form is someone that needs to protect his child above all else. I can't argue this point however even without children I feel that tug of protect the defenseless. Viggo (again, the character is never named even in the book) is dying so the movie is set up as a timed race...get south to the warmed climate before Dad gives in to what we have to assume is cancer. As his son sleeps he is wracked with coughing and clearly weakening as the movie progresses. We know based on the boys age how long it has been since the world was destroyed. One has to assume a nuclear strike of some sort however the movie (and book) never dwell on the how or why of the situation and only focus on the simplest of human things...where is my next meal and where is is warmer as winter sets in. Pushing a shopping cart of belongings and meeting other travelers on the way south is the plot. Some people are kind and you wonder how they survive until they ask ""what do I have to do for some food"". Yes, you shudder and tear up at the thought of a 80+ year old man making his way in that world by doing ""favors"" but seemingly it is that or be eaten. Others you know are bad people and you need to get out of the situation without wasting strength and limited bullets.

My highest praise to the adaptation as they essentially filmed the book. There was no added garbage and all the necessary parts of the book were there on the big screen (or my TV). When reading the book you imagined the world to be black and white. The film was clearly done in color but overall it was a grey palette only sometimes with bursts of color...a tarp, a can of food, a fire. The flashbacks were also executed well however I think that the movie changed the whole death of the mother thing. That said, I would need to dig the book out to be sure but I know that it wasn't the same.

On the other hand, it's incredibly bleak.

True to the Cormac MacCarthy novel, it is uncompromisingly dark. After all, nuclear war has destroyed all civilization, brought on permanent Nuclear Winter, and the remaining humans are mostly those who have turned to cannibalism.
That's not going to have a happy ending.

This isn't an 'SF' film. In many ways it feels very much like a medieval story of a dying father and his young son trying to make their way alone through a blighted and dangerous wilderness. Their circumstances are certainly medieval.

If you are in the mood to handle the doom and gloom, this is an extremely well done film.
Don't see it if you're feeling depressed. If you're depressed, see CARRIERS instead for a mostly more upbeat take. If you're really depressed, try 'DUCK SOUP' or 'WHAT DREAMS MAY COME' for a happy ending.

3577082,4,B001FB5634,"The Road (John Hillcoat, 2009)

It has been a long time since I've read The RoadI got an ARC of it from a pal of mine at CNN before its release and read it immediatelyso when I finally sat down to watch the movie, my memories of the book were hazy at best. I know relying on my memory of a book I read eight years ago is probably not the best thing in the world to do when comparing a film adaptation to it, but I remember, for what that's worth, the book not being anywhere near as unfocused and episodic as the movie.

Then Robert Duvall gave that brilliant monologue*, and I no longer cared.

Plot: the world has effectively ended. (While the film, true to the book, never reveals the exact cause of the end of humanity, both the book's descriptions and the movie's subdued lighting will call to mind the vivid descriptions of nuclear winter anyone of a certain age was fed.) Two characters we know only as Man (The Prophecy's Viggo Mortensen) and Boy (Let Me In's Kodi Smit-McPhee) are wandering the post-apocalyptic landscape along the titular road. They may have a goal; they may not. (I have always assumed they were going to some legendary safe zone, but that is probably me projecting onto this from a hundred unrelated zombie movies.) They do their best to avoid the roving bands of cannibals; food is scarce, so human beings have turned to eating one another when they cannot find anything else. Man tells us, in a voiceover, that he fears only two things: cannibals and hunger. You find out why soon enough. The present-day pieces are interspersed with dreams, memories, and reflections Man has of the pre-apocalypse days, with his wife (Monster's Charlize Theron) and, when they stumble upon Man's childhood home, of things even before that. They discover a few more friendly fellow travelers along the way, but this is the only escape from the drudgery of their daily lives.

Mortensen and Smit-McPhee are both top-tier actors, and the two of them should be enough to carry this symbolism-laden film, especially when paired with John Hillcoat (The Proposition), who was the perfect director to take on this source material. And yet still, what stood out to me were the cameos. A number of very well-known actors show up here in minor parts; I've already mentioned Duvall, and then there are Guy Pearce and Molly Parker as a married couple, Michael Kenneth Williams, Garret Dillahunt... each graces the screen for less than five minutes (Theron doesn't have much more than that), and each shines. Williams is a perfect archetype of the desperation of those survivors who have not joined one of the cannibal gangs in a way that Mortensen never is, though by all rights he should be. Pearce delivers the one-liner that is the moral to the entire story and still manages to pass it off in such a way that you might miss it if you blink. (I was reminded, favorably, of the immortal final shot of Dellamorte Dell'Amore.) Because of this, I ended up having to conclude that neither of our main characters is pulling much of the weight in this movie. I am now very happy I didn't end up seeing it until after Let Me In and ParaNorman had already made me a rabid Smit-McPhee fan.

Now having said all that, I know I'm harping on the negative aspects of a movie that I'm giving a rating of you really should see this and considering adding to the thousand-best list. I don't mean to. Blame it on the movie's relentlessly bleak atmosphere, which I rush to add is perfectly appropriate for the material. And it's obvious from the film's reception, both critical (75% at Rotten Tomatoes) and popular (68% RT, 7.3 at IMDB), that its general plotlessness didn't hamstring it, the way that sort of thing does with so many movies. (I ascribe the credit, or blame, for this solely to Hillcoat, whose mastery of celluloid shows new aspects with every movie he releases.)  The movie does take a while to get up to speed, and it is intentionally (I assume) confusing/disorienting for a bit. Also, you have to pay attention to it or you'll miss some of the more important bits, none of which I can tell you without major spoilers. Trust me, it's worth paying the extra attention when one of them rolls around. Hillcoat takes a lot of time setting up most of his characters, even the minor ones, which make the movie feel slow. Don't let that deter you; this is one you will find yourself mulling over long after the final frame has passed your eyes. *** 

* According to IMDB's trivia section, Duvall's monologue is at least partly extemporaneous; when I read this, that little I KNEW it! light clicked in my head. It feels a little off with the rest of the script, and ends up marking the movie's turning point. It may be complete coincidence that it falls where it does, though I suspect once they realized the gold they had, some editorial prowess was put to use subtly emphasizing the importance of that monologue. In any case, if you don't watch the movie for any other reason, watch it for this scene; it is the post-apocalyptic equivalent of Michael Fassbender's riveting monologue in Hunger.",1409097600,,5091,4.6301218161683275

3577086,3,B001FB5634,"The end of the world has never looked so fabulous! With the release of 2012 and The Road, Hollywood
has again turned its attention to the end times for the late great planet Earth. Forget dramatic tragedies like
Titanic (1997) or futuristic world angst like Blade Runner (1982) these films are about the granddaddy
of them all. While most of us in the viewing audience would essentially be drowned by mega tsunamis or
crushed by massive objects like the Christ Redeemer Statue in Rio de Janeiro, our leading actors get to work
on troubles of their own.
This kind of film is indeed a more modern but hardly a new phenomenon. Even if you wanted to go further
back from I am Legend (2007) or The Day after Tomorrow (2004), you could visit the Mad Max
series, which started in 1979, or (if you want to wade through it) Waterworld (1995--sorry, always wanted
to use that pun!). This week, Hollywood Henry focuses on the latest saga at worlds end: The Road.
The Road represents the latest adaptation from a novel by Cormac McCarthy. Last year McCarthys No
Country for Old Men won over both audiences and critics alike. This film, based on the 2006 novel of the
same name, follows an unnamed father and son as they struggle to survive in a post-apocalypse worldand
what struggles they encounter.
Their journey is to travel the long road that leads to the coast, where presumably there will be food, water,
shelter, and maybe other survivors. Along the way the land is barren, and between searching for resources
and hiding from wandering cannibals, the father will stop at nothing to protect his son.
Viggo Mortensen, in a haunting performance, portrays the father with constant pain on his face. With every
expression, he is scared, sad, and concerned, yet he tries to hide it from his son. We know this man has seen
the worst of humanity, but still he will not let his son give up on the world.
Fans of the novel will enjoy the faithful translation to the screen. The book paints a bleak vision of the
world, and this film commits to that vision. The director, John Hillcoat, was lucky enough to secure the
filming location of the abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike, a 13-mile stretch of road that has been unused
since the 60s. The natural overgrowth and crumbling pavement give the film a very authentic feel.
Now, to say it as simply as possible, this is not exactly a feel-good movie. The world is bleak, some
characters are despicable, and at times the hurdles never seem to end. But at the same time, there is
something inspiring watching a man do anything he can to protect his family.",1408406400,,2584,4.64410480349345

3577235,3,B001FB5634,"When I read the novel (which I strongly recommend, regardless of how you feel about the film), I thought ""This wouldn't be too hard to film. Just keep everything simple, and don't go changing things."" And when I heard that John Hillcoat (whose ""The Proposition"" I'd been wowed by) would be directing, I thought ""This is going to be a fine film.""

It isn't. It's a disappointment, because Hillcoat made two serious errors.

The first error is the Man's narration. There's almost nothing in it that isn't shown or implied in the film's images. Using words to describe things the audience can see is poor storytelling. His mentioning cannibalism early on is particularly bad, as it reduces the shock when the Man and the Boy enter a house occupied by cannibals (and their victims).

The second error is the inclusion of a musical score. In a well-acted drama, the actors convey the emotion. Music isn't needed to underline, emphasize, or complement those emotions. It can have a distancing and sentimentalizing effect, as it does here. (""Tender Mercies"" has no score, and doesn't need it.)

Even without these mistakes, the movie suffers from the need to convert McCarthy's words into images. At least half the effect of the novel comes from his spare writing. The conversion is not unlike popping a soap bubble.

Your time would be better spent reading the book, one of the finest novels I've ever read. It's probably impossible to make a film that fully captures the essence of this work.

PS: It appears that someone has gone through the recent reviews, and given every one that isn't strongly negative a ""not helpful"" rating. This is simply rude.

3577239,1,B001FB5634,"To hear Wikipedia tell it, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Cormac McCarthy got his inspiration for THE ROAD during a visit to El Paso with his son.  He had a vision of ""fires on the hill"" and pictured the place 50 to 100 years hence and thought about his young son.  That was the supposed genesis for his writing the novel upon which this film was based. The author had his inspirational moment in 2003.  The movie ROAD TO PERDITION came out in 2002 and - while that film's subject matter did not deal with a post-apocalyptic world in the most extreme sense of that phrase - its story essence and themes and arc are virtually identical to the storyline and thematic thrust of THE ROAD.  In the vastly superior ROAD TO PERDITION, apart from the similar title, there is the same father and son dynamic, the perilous road travels, the loss of the mother, the death of the dad (also taking place by the sea!)and the rescue of the boy by another family.  And there is also man's best friend at the end of each film to complete the picture of a fine family unit.

But apart from THE ROAD's possibly subconscious or even conscious theft of the main ingredients of ROAD TO PERDITION, when answering Oprah as to whence came his inspiration, Cormac McCarthy apparently neglected to acknowledge all of the ""last man on earth"" stories in books and films that have come before his vision of ""fires on the hill"" and his subsequent conversations with his brother as to what an apocalyptic world would be like.  Did he never read or see THE STAND, I AM LEGEND, FIVE, PANIC IN YEAR ZERO, A BOY AND HIS DOG, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and myriads more?  Or is Cormac McCarthy just too Pulitzer Prize proud to admit to the influence of what he might consider lesser talents and B (B for better!) pictures dealing with his same themes?  Does he live in a cultural cave?  Did he really think his vision of ""fires on the hill"" was in some way...original?  But just as ROAD TO PERDITION is a definite candidate for the template to THE ROAD, so do many prior films find echoes in the film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's book.  Some examples: when father and son finally reach the ocean and there is a huge derelict ship just off the coast, all I could think of was the ending of PLANET OF THE APES, the original film, and the twisted, metallic remains of the Statue of Liberty discovered on the shoreline offering mute evidence of mankind's doom. As to the cannibalism theme, Cormac McCarthy told the WSJ that this came about during conversations with his brother about different scenarios for a post-apocalyptic world.  Again, as with a magician drawing attention with one hand while the other does the magic, it seems the author wants his listeners and readers to believe his visions are self-generated or inspired by blood relations, to kind of keep it all in the family. Did he never hear of the Donner party or see NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD?  As to THE ROAD's listless refrain of the dad and son being the ""good guys"", check out 1962's Ray Milland directed PANIC IN YEAR ZERO about a family's survival following a nuclear war.  In the end of that dated but much finer film, the surviving family are described by a military patrol as ""five more good ones."" And the dog must have bounded over from A BOY AND HIS DOG or was related to Will Smith's canine cutie from I AM LEGEND.

Speaking of the dog, why is this the only animal that seems to have survived whatever it is happened to the world, what, ten years prior in this film's fractured storyline?  Why does the dad press a gun to his little lad's forehead to traumatize the already traumatized lad?  Couldn't the dad be a bit more discrete about the possibility of having to kill his own son in order to save him, like George was with Lenny?  Why do the people who shoot the arrow in the dad's leg act as if they were the wronged ones?  Why did the family in the end follow the dad and boy and never reveal themselves until the dad was dead? Why would the man walk right up to the boy holding a gun? How is it that the dad never realized that four people and a dog were following them? Why didn't the dog ever bark? Why does the dad just bring back a flare gun from his absurd exploration of the derelict ship? So he can use it in the next scene? How is it the son slept through the entire theft of his beach belongings? Why does ROLLING STONE's Peter Travers say ""Charlize Theron captures the power of Cormac McCarthy's words"" when she has practically nothing whatsoever to say and what she does say is right out of Acting School?  Why does ESQUIRE proclaim this movie ""The most important movie of the year""? and what is the Kool-Aid these folks are drinking?  Why does the dad stick to the roads instead and never teach his kid to hunt or fish?  Why does the dad want to reach the sea so badly? Why does the lad believe it is a dog nosing about the secret bomb-shelter hideout when he never saw a dog in his life?  Why does the dad think it isn't a dog?  Why does the dad then leave the ideal secret place and the cache of food?  Why does he let his wife just wander away to die? Why is the dialog in this movie absolutely dull and incredibly unbelievable?  Why is the kid in this movie absolutely annoying and amateurish in every single scene?  Why didn't the kid take some lessons on how to act like a son from Mark McCain and why didn't the dad learn how to be a better dad like Lucas McCain?  Why didn't the dad find more ammo for his almost pointless pistol in all the years he had to explore abandoned sporting goods stores and the empty homes of hunters?  Why doesn't dad share more of his inner fire with the old man?  Why do all the trees in the forest come crashing down at once?  To shake up and wake up the audience? Why does the DVD have a feature including Deleted and Extended Scenes when this movie was seemingly unending and terminally boring as it was in its theatrical release?  Why was this totally unbelievable and dull as dirt movie even made?  None of it was in way remotely believable and all of it was clearly evident as having come out of one man's head. Never once, not in a single scene or frame of film, did I ever believe that the otherwise wonderful actor Viggo Mortensen was other than an actor - and that after the day's filming had wrapped he wouldn't wash up, clean the phony dirt from his fingernails and rip into a nice steak diner.

Rex Reed called this film ""Brilliant!"" But he also thought Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH a terrible film.  Well, there is no accounting for taste - or the thirst-quenching albeit deadly delights of certain types of Kool-Aid.",1393545600,4,6634,4.382544861337683

3577284,5,B001FB5634,"This is definitely the BEST, the most extreme and the most shocking of all post-apocalyptics films I ever saw in my life. I am afraid I will never be able to forget it, even and especially the scenes which I would actually be glad to forget... But still, I am very glad I watched it. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

A man (Viggo Mortensen) and his 12 year old son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) struggle to survive after an unspecified cataclysm has apparently killed most plant and animal life. Countless millions of people starved, civilization has collapsed and survivors are reduced to scavenging and even cannibalism. The father and son are travelling to the south, following a road which leaves to the coast where - they hope - some plants and animals survived. The man carries a revolver but they have only two bullets.

This is a slow paced film, with very few characters (Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and Michael Kenneth Williams appear, but only in cameos) and for most of it we can see only the father and son. For the greatest part of the film there is little action and also very little color - it is a very bleak, cold, misty, gray and mostly dead world... And yet, this film kept me hooked from the beginning to the end and I couldn't stop watching it. Viggo Mortensen proves here once again that he is an INCREDIBLE actor, one of the best in the business in our times - and young Kodi Smit-McPhee supports him valiantly.

This film is very good but so shocking and intense that even if bought the book, I still didn't dare to read it - because it seems it is even TOUGHER than the movie...

I decided to deliberately keep this review short to avoid any temptation to give more spoilers, because you really deserve to discover it in all its splendor and terror by yourself. So I will just say here once more - this is an INCREDIBLY powerful, shocking and very, very sad masterpiece. It deserves to be discovered, but DO NOT watch it if you feel depressed or even a little bit down - because it will not do you any good. One needs to brace himself a little before watching ""The Road"" ...

But ultimately, to survive, the boy must cast this burden off and trust his own intuition about people. So, the movie became about generations casting off the corrupt wisdom of prior generations.

It is so far removed from action flicks (Mad Max Trilogy, The Postman, Waterworld, 1990 Bronx warriors, After the Fall of NY) speculative Sc-fi, (A Boy and his Dog, Last Man on Earth, Omega Man, Zardoz) or horror (countless zombie movies, Doomsday, Stakeland). What we have is a movie that is unrepentantly REAL. That is why the focus is not on action, survival montages, gore, anti-heros, a bad-ass villain or even the cause of the apocalypse. It's about unconditional love and what happens when the ultimate kindness you could give your own child might be to take his life. I've watched this movie three times now and it is truly about being the only candle in complete darkness. The movie is dour, depressing, bleak - but it is also one of the most hopeful, sentimental movies I've ever seen. Notice how many scenes there are of Viggo Mortenson holding his child, cradling his child, kissing his child. How many scenes of him declaring, pleading, thinking - ""I will do ANYTHING, to keep my child alive."" If you thought this movie was boring or had no story - it's because you are boring. You brought none of your own intelligence, self-reflection or humanity to the table. It's the whole point of the movie. Almost all post-apocalypse movies are based on characters fighting over or trying to find some scarce resource. In Mad Max it's gas. Soylent Green/Food. Zombie movies/a place to fortify and live safely. Waterworld/land. Children of Men/safeguarding fertility. In the The Road the scarcity of the resource is Humanity. The father and son are fighting for humanity. They are on the road because they aren't looking for food, water or shelter - they're look for the ""good guys."" They are looking for humanity. I completely understand that for someone who likes the more familiar action/sci-fi type of post-apocalypse movies that this film might not be entertaining to you - but perhaps that's the best time to simply understand that the movie isn't in your wheelhouse. You certainly can say you ""Didn't like it."" But I can't imagine the type of dolt who would rate this one star because they can't find a theme. an emotion, or a contemplative thought to hold on to when they reflect upon the movie. All the one star reviews that say there is no story. That's a movie watcher that must be willfully blind. What did they they think the artists who made the movie where trying to do?

3577326,4,B001FB5634,"Adapted from the Pulitzer Prize willing novel of the same name, The Road (2009) follows the adventures of a man and his son, as they travel across the barren countryside, and wasted wilderness, after some unspecified catastrophic event, has resulted in the deterioration of civilization.

Viggo Mortensen (,) plays the unnamed man, and Kodi Smit-McPhee plays his wide-eyed innocent son.  Hungry and cold, the pair are headed south, hoping to find a warmer climate and the coast, pushing a cart with their worldly possessions, through a desolate and wasted world.  With animal life apparently mostly exterminated, many survivors have turned to cannibalism.  Armed with a gun with only two bullets, the pair scavenge for food, while trying to avoid human predators.

Centered on the relationship of the boy and his papa, The Road has some touching and tender moments, but it is mostly a dark gripping adventure, with few rays of hope.  The man is trying to get his son to a safer place, and teach him what he needs to survive, but this appears to be a monumental task.  Despite the horrific conditions, his son remains very innocent, and repeatedly displays a compassion for others, which could easily prove to be fatal.  This aspect may not always ring true, but without it, the story would not make as strong a connection with the viewer.

Staying generally true to Cormac McCarthys book, The Road paints a picture of a harsh grungy world, with a very bleak future.  The story focuses almost entirely on Smit-McPhee and Mortensen, who both give engaging and powerful performances.  Guy Pearce (,), and Oscar winners Charlize Theron (), and Robert Duvall (,) appear in small, but pivotal roles.

His basic motivations are very clearly understood, but the father makes some questionable decisions, such as abandoning a food supply, and swimming naked in the ocean.  The sons idealism may seem unrealistic, but is the one bright spot in an otherwise Stygian landscape.  The Road certainly isn't for everyone, but the struggle to survive, strikes a deep emotional chord.",1387843200,,2066,5.020527859237537
3577327,4,B001FB5634,"I am a movie watcher that prefers happy endings. At least, that's what I thought. But over time, I've come to realize that I am a movie watcher who just needs satisfying endings. I don't need the good guy to win (though I prefer it) I just need to be satisfied that the plot came to a conclusion. You can imagine that I hate ambiguous endings.

Well, The Road, as depressing as it is. Does not have an ambiguous ending. In fact, the movie is quite possibly the most faithful adaptation of the novel I have ever seen. I read the book many years ago and recently saw this movie for the first time today. Every scene that I read in that book came flooding back to me and I remembered mostly what happened next.

And it is through those memories and having read the book that I realized, this should have never been made into a movie.

You see, The Road is and will always be depressing.

It's a powerful tale about a father and a son. They are nameless so that you the watcher/reader can put yourself in these characters shoes. There are tender moments where they find a cache of food and enjoy in the simple things. Taking a bath, having a shave, getting a haircut, eating pears from a can, eating chips. All luxuries that we take for granted in our modern world. The man even gets to enjoy a bit of alcohol and a smoke.

The movie is slow, because the book is slow. The movie is depressing, because the book is depressing. The unfavorable reviews do not come from the fact that the movie is unfaithful, or that it was poorly acted, or that it was badly directed and edited.

Quite the contrary, The Road received it's bad reviews because it's not a book that you ""like."" It haunts you, it disturbs you, it touches you, and it makes you cry. But you will not find yourself ""LOVING"" the book like you would in a book that was more entertaining. To love the book wouldn't make sense, because no one would want to re-read a book that makes you feel so terribly depressed. The movie is exactly the same way because it captures the novel almost scene for scene.

Viggo Mortenson was absolutely top notch and probably could have won an academy award for this performance. But I can't tell you to watch the film. It's just not something you can love, it's not meant to be that way.

All The Road is supposed to do, which it does until the very end. Is remind you of the eternal, unbreakable, love and bond between a father and a son.

If the book upset you when you read it, don't watch this movie. If you got through the book and think you can keep it together, watch the movie. If you've never read the book, it's going to be a tough road for you to travel.",1387497600,,2650,4.273453093812376

Inspiring, poignant and loving throughout as a loving Father and loving son face unimaginable challenges after a catastrophe of epic proportion.  At no time is there any maudlin sense of despair or finality, just love and trust.

3577361,4,B001FB5634,"This is a good film.  The story is good.

I stopped watching this film after the father and son were hiding trapped in the country house taken over by cannibals. It wasn't the suspense, or the revolting idea of human being eating other human beings to avoid starving, it was a combination of both.  I didn't want to see any more.

My first reaction to the film was that the basic premise of the story was flawed.  Although some human beings survived some massive undefined catastrophe, there is no plant or animal life left to support them. The idea that human beings can outlast all plant and animal life on this planet is not exactly logical.

There is no indication of what went wrong.  I guess that was supposed to be irrelevant, but when you think about it, it's not. I suppose that with no explanation of what went wrong, the premise of the movie is easier to accept.

For whatever reason, about two or three weeks later, I decided to pick up where I left off.  All I can say is that I enjoyed the rest of the film and will say that it's worth watching.  This is a film with a very spiritual message.

3577366,4,B001FB5634,"After watching Threads I decided that I needed to watch something a bit more light hearted, so I picked The Road :-) So it is a bit more upbeat than Threads, but not by much. It tells the story of a man and his son doing whatever they need to survive in a dying world. Their dream is to reach the coast, although it's not clear what they hope to achieve beyond that besides survival.

It's a bleak film in every respect, they have to scratch through the ruins of the world to find enough food to eat. They have to fear everyone they meet in case they view them as sport, or even worse as food. For the most part the people they meet are incidental, it is the boy and the father who are the centre of attention.

They both play their parts well, the father is hard making the difficult choices where needed and trying to teach his son what he needs to know to survive. The boy is more innocent, are rather he is more hopeful, he wants to see the occasional glimpses of colour in a grey world. They balance each other well and he provides some balance to a grim film.

And it is a grim film (the book even more so, but also worth checking out), but it is very well put together and acted. This is an excellent watch and highly recommended.",1383523200,,1237,4.145833333333333

3577368,5,B001FB5634,"Let me preface this by saying that, with a few exceptions, I am not a fan of the post-apocalyptic setting.  That said, this movie, and the book upon which it was based, are brilliantly compelling.  The story follows a man and his son traveling south down the titular road.  They have no real destination, but they keep walking all the same.  No explaination of the disaster that caused the end of the world is ever given, leaving the reader/viewer to draw their own conclusions.

Throughout the story, our unnamed characters meet with several hardships, and the main story follows their attempts at survival.  There are moments of fear, moments of sadness, and even moments of joy.  Throughout, the boy can be seen to serve as the father's moral compass.  While some may find him to be irritating or downright aggrivating, I find him to be an important foil to not only his father, but the world around him.

This film captures the intensity and spirit of the original novel wonderfully, and the acting is amazing.  This film is not for everyone, though; moments of disturbing imagery abound, along with gruesome scenes and human cruelty might stand as a barrier to some.  The film is extremely intense, and really pulls you in by the collar.  If you can handle that sort of thing, please buy not only this film, but the book as well.",1382832000,2,1334,4.6781115879828326

3577420,2,B001FB5634,"End of the world movies can generally be categorized into one of three categories.  The first is the zombie scenario, which is probably the most popular in terms of ticket sales and advertising.  Examples of this genre including everything from action thrillers like World War Z, to gory horror flicks like the Resident Evil franchise, to comedies like ZombieLand.  The second category are the alien invasion movies.  Here we have films like Skyline, Storage 24, Oblivion, and others of this kind.  Then there is everything else, few of which see much success.  A good example of the latter is ""The Road"" which came out in 2009.  Set in a near future where smoky fires cloud the skies yet rain and gloom cover the earth, the film seems set in a USA after a nuclear war has disabled the infrastructure of modern technology.  The plot follows a man and his son who travel westward to the Pacific Ocean hoping to find any community to live with.  Along the way they meet cannibals, criminals, and other refugees.  The father dreams about his past, life before the catastrophe, and shortly thereafter up to and including the birth of their son.  There is also a long running dialogue between father and son about good and evil, and whether they count as good people versus some of the evil people they have met.  The overall mood of the movie is somber, grim, and dark.  Compared to other end of the world movies, this would classify more as a drama with only the occasional scene of action or suspense.

The movie is hauntingly sorrowful, keeping McCarthy's original prose--both in narrative and dialogue--but removes some of the content for sake of storytelling.

The movie does an excellent job of progressing the story naturally, even choosing to move McCarthy's foreshadowing elements to the rear of the movie. What is left on screen is a naturally flowing story that doesn't stumble for the sake of art.

The intent and prose is much the same, but small elements were added to take off some of the biting edge of the book. Without spoiling things for either the reader or viewer, the following scenes in the movie were softened by changing elements in the book: the coke can scene, the bunker leaving scene, and the beach family scene. The changed elements are subtle, but are enough to smooth out the puncturing effects of the book.

Make no mistake; the movie is still heavy and brutal. The filming is beautiful (characters walking along a pool of water reflecting the fiery backdrop) and moving (perfectly scored musical accompaniment--my pet peeve of what was missing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-For-Old-Men/dp/B006H8JJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country For Old Men</a>'s adaptation from McCarthy's novel).

With no plants or animals left alive, the few people that they encounter have shed all signs of civilization as they resort to thievery and cannibalism in order to survive, leaving it up to the boy and his dad to keep the last flame of humanity alive within them. Few films are as bleak and unforgiving as John Hillcoat's adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel, THE ROAD. Fewer, still, possess the same emotionally uplifting feelings of love and hope despite their dark surroundings. THE ROAD is a beautiful and touching story depicting the undying love between a father and son, who are literally willing to die to protect one another after witnessing the end of the world. Viggo Mortensen proves, once again, that he is one of the finest actors of his generation in another devastating performance. The gut-wrenching scenes where his character must choose between mercifully killing his son or risking his capture at the hands of many evil men drive the emotional tension to its veritable extreme. Robert Duvall also makes an Oscar-worthy appearance in a supporting role, as well. While the finely-written characters and remarkable cast certainly serve as the film's core, it is the incredible art direction and utter desolation found in the production design that lead us to believe this truly is the end of the world. Hillcoat delivers on all fronts, and leaves us in a state of emotional shock from this deeply moving yet equally painful struggle to keep hope and love alive.

3577569,4,B001FB5634,"The stark, black and white, post-apocalyptic, world I pictured in my mind while reading Cormac McCarthy's 'The Road' is forever laid out in memory in the film by director, John Hillcoat. The real world after a series, of fires and disasters have destroyed the world we know, and 'The Road' is as visible a film as any I have seen.

Many rumors of this film and how it could never live up to the hype of the novel have been swirling through the Internet. What we have here is a masterpiece of a film. It is a powerful vision of a world ten years after some sort of disaster took over. The scenes were shot in post Katrina, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and what they call the 'Abandoned Pennsylvania Highway'. Into this harrowing world marches a man, played by Viggo Mortensen and his son, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee, trying to find their way to warmth. The coldness of the world is marked, and we can feel the chill. What they encounter is a horror filled world, one in which a group of cannibals keep a farm of humans with missing limbs in their basement. Gangs of marauders around every corner. We see their day to day existence, filthy as they march along, trying to scrape up food to keep alive. They find a house where a left over can of coke amazes the boy, he has never seen it before, and they gorge themselves with food before marching on once again. The stark reality of their life is measured against the gray world where everything is dying. And in this world, the man is teaching his son about goodness versus evil. What we come to see is that the love of this man for his son is the light that may keep this struggle alive. The absence of a God is evident. The pureness of the son may be the antidote.

Charlize Theron plays the mother in a small part, and she portrays the lack of hope that seems so evident throughout the film. Robert Duvall is the Old Man who conveys bits of wisdom. The son wants to help those who are crying for help, but his father tells him they must move on. They can only trust each other. This film is all about the father and his son. Viggo Mortensen is tremendous in this role, and he plays in every scene. The son is as he should be, watchful, hopeful, luminous at times.

The agony of the life that is left to the father and his son is conveyed with such realism. John Hillcoat has captured the feel and the look of the novel. It was difficult at times to keep watching, but then I had to watch. We all want the man and his son to succeed. They are our hope. ""We're the good guys, they're the bad guys"" is the message the father is conveying. But deep inside there is the hope that the boy and his father will find more.

The world, as we know it, has been destroyed by an apparent nuclear holocaust, and the story is told in present tense and flashback memories of how things were before.  While the movie does move along, it is not for anyone who wants a lot of slam/bang action.

3577640,4,B001FB5634,"I'm not really sure how to rate it. This is the most convincing, human, gritty and ""real"" depressing fictional film I've ever seen. It's genuinely horrifying, even though the gore/horror only appears once, technically, and only for a brief moment. I don't think this movie will ever, ever ""leave"" me. (I's also a pretty unique case of the understated gore/horror being more horrifying than graphic depictions.)

It makes the historical accounts of widespread, starvation-induced cannibalism seem almost understandable, in a realistic (yet still deplorable) way. I'm not sure I wanted to understand that, and this movie actually exceeds the real historic accounts of cannibalism within a scenario that humans have never yet experienced, to my knowledge (global loss of things to eat, besides other people.)

Maybe ""we"" need the scenario laid out in this bare sort of detail. Or maybe films like this are best left as hypothetical? I don't know. I do know the movie was more like some sort of ""documentary of the hypothetical"" than a film depicting fiction. Similar situations have actually happened before, even if not on such a global scale.

How to rate a movie like this? 5 stars or one? I don't know. I'm going with 4, because the movie is incredibly effective and moving. Its downfall is a failure to...do anything besides depress, I guess. 4 stars ain't bad, either.",1362528000,3,1371,5.030837004405286

The movie is surprisingly faithful to that, which is probably why it is unwatchable for the majority of the American audience. It's just too grim for a culture looking for tear jerking reunions and happy go lucky adventures. However, if you are willing to watch a movie that will not make you feel good, this is that movie. It's stunning in every way, from visual to soundtrack, to the acting by Viggo Mortensen, who is as usual, completely committed to his role.

3577644,4,B001FB5634,"Some movies are hard to watch, and The Road belongs in that category. But I have chosen to review it because it deserves an audience. The director is John Hillcoat, who was responsible for The Proposition and Lawless. Like both of those movies, this one features music composed by Nick Cave. The bleak nature of the story is a perfect fit for Cave's music.

As you might expect, the movie didn't have much of an impact at the box office. I suppose that most people are reluctant to expose themselves to such a sad story?

When you strip it right down, the film is about the love a father has for his son. We never learn their names; any references made simply refer to The Man (Mortensen) and The Boy (Smit-McPhee). These two actors carry the movie, but we occasionally see people they encounter, and flashbacks of The Man's wife (Theron). Her role is small, but the scenes are effective, and help to frame the story.

There are many reasons to see this movie.

Viggo Mortensen delivers a superb performance that failed to receive the Oscar recognition it deserved. Perhaps the voters never saw the movie either?

We learn that The Man's wife couldn't face life in a world where everything was dying, so he is solely responsible for his son. The reason for the apocalypse is only hinted at, and mentions a sudden light. It leaves the skies permanently gray, and everything covered in a layer of ash. Trees, plants, and insects are dead or dying. The only life remaining comes in the form of a few humans, and many of them aren't too fussy about how they survive.

Perhaps this is what the world might eventually look like if Earth was struck by an asteroid?

The movie could be viewed as a metaphor for life itself. When we face terrible events in our own lives, most of us choose to weather the storm and survive to the best of our abilities. Imagine a life where there was nothing left to achieve. What would you do? The Man decides that he will take his son to the coast. Perhaps things will be better there, and maybe there will be something left alive.

What makes The Road an astounding story is the writing. Cormac McCarthy's book is strangely moving. It succeeds because of the intensity of the brief dialog between father and son. The son asks a lot of questions, and often wonders whether they are the good guys. The father explains as well as he can, and his son accepts all of his words without question.

The Road is nothing like McCarthy's No Country for Old Men, and isn't designed to be a piece of entertainment. It's a study on human character, and what drives us to exist at all. I admire post-apocalyptic stories when they are done well, and this is about as realistic as it gets. If you enjoy seeing how society breaks down when money is meaningless and food is scarce, you'll find the story interesting. If you are a parent, I would be surprised if you aren't moved at the love between father and son.

What would you do to protect the life of your child? How would you justify your actions? Could you kill and still be a good person?

I won't reveal how the story ends, or comment on whether it is uplifting or as sad as the rest of the movie. That's for you to discover. All I will see is that The Road is a significant achievement, and brings to life a book that seemed almost impossible to film. The cinematography is particularly convincing.

If you are a fan of The Grey, The Mist, Children of Men, or The Stand, there's a fair chance you'll find something interesting in The Road. Don't watch it if you are expecting an action movie.

The Blu-ray offers a strong presentation, but it won't dazzle you because the colors are deliberately muted to fit the story. You need to be in the right mood to watch The Road, but it's worth it when that mood strikes. You'll never take another meal for granted.",1362268800,,3826,4.464183381088826
3577645,4,B001FB5634,"I start off this review by openly admiting that this is probably one of my top favorite personal movies. I've also ready the book by Cormac McCarthy as well so I have an extensive knowledge of the comparison and contrasts between the two (which pleasantly is not much contrast).

Lets Begin:

The Plot:
An apocalyptic disaster has struck the face of the earth to such a degree, literally everything has been destroyed. An un named man and his also un named son are seeking warmth as the climate continues to grow cold from lack of sunlight. This is their journey to the south as they attempt to try to survive in this god-forsaken world.

**Potential Spoilers**
The plot's exciting enough, and I suppose the plot is also one of this movie's (and the book)'s biggest flaws. Unfortunately, for most media related folks, if you watch the trailer for this movie, you are being mislead. This movie is not an action film. (Fallout 3/Book of Eli fans should not expect action of this caliber). Instead, Cormac McCarthy offers a ""spiritual"" story that evokes emotion within a sad and bitter world via the plot.

The situation is so hopeless, even the man's wife decides to commit suicide in order to end her agony instead of trying to survive. This is one of many depressing scenarios that The Road has to offer viewers and believe me, this movie is extremely depressing.

The story plot is unfortunately very dull otherwise though. Despite having to deal with cannibals and generally surviving, other than the interactions between the father and son, there's not much that happens in this movie. You will probably find yourself bored (especially if the trailers influenced you to watch this film). The film also ends pretty abruptly in such a way that you feel a little empty when you finish the film. However...

There are several means of interpreting this ending. Because the movie is so depressing, we find that there are some key points in presenting the themes in this movie. The idea of ""what remains of 'humanity'"" is central to the plot of this film and I feel that again, it's a spiritual experience in what viewers will take from the poetic set up of characters. Which leads me to the next part of the review.

Characters: **MAJOR SPOILERS**
All characters in this film are un named. The only names we receive during the credits are even generalized to ""the man"" or ""the boy."" All characters also play a central roll within this movie as well which I feel are the movie's magnificent strong points and to a certain degree, makes up for the seemingly lacking plot.

The father is the strong figure who (as we come to find out) is the backbone for his family. He is to the viewer the deteriorating ""human"" voice-of-reason who is quickly diminishing as he continues in a world of blank turmoil. He's boisterous and determined to keep his family safe and alive, but eventually even he succombs to hopelessness and eventually to other things as well. He is the dying humanity looking to pass on what's left of human reason and compassion over to his son. The son acts as the ""hope"" and the sole bearer of his father's legacy to be human in a world where humanity is no more. Eventually even the son, as young as he is, realizes this and the movie ends as soon as he is faced with this charge.

While most of the important characters remain prominent, a lot of the background characters are very almost ""ghost"" like in their presence in the film (even to the effet of the film). All the actor cameos hardly seem worth mentioning because of this as most everying (besides Robert Duvall who has maybe a 15 minute role in the film).

Themes:
The above mentioned themes of humanity are discussed heavily in this film. However, it's sad because the father and son seem to be the only thing left of the proverbial ""family"" and that's what makes this so depressing. The father is trying to indoctrinate his son with the means to survive after he's gone.

The relationship between the father and son are also sub-theme for this movie and provides for a slightly heartwarming (and in some ways, heartbreaking) scenario.

The idea of the entropy of humanity is also discussed and presented. It makes anyone wonder ""How can I survive when the world runs out of food and resources?""

Differences Between the Film and Book:
Pleasantly there's not many differences. I feel that the few scenes that were cut from the film were most likely due to length reasons. (I believe a few of these are included as extras in the DVD film) but for the most part, the plot, characters and story arc are all the exact same way.

Conclusion:
The Road is not for everyone. For those looking for an action film, look elsewhere. The Road is not for you.

For those looking for a heartwarming happy story about a man and his son, DEFINITELY do not look here.

The folks who are looking for a poetic, moving and psychologically involving movie, look no further. The Road has a nice blend of melancholy with a realistic look on how things migh turn out via the aftermath of some apocolyptic disaster. I would think of no better movie to use as an example to discuss the ideas of ""what would remain"" of humanity at the end of the world, and this movie does enough justice to create a very chilling environment and experience to have you as the viewer question your own ethics in times of turmoil.

3577646,1,B001FB5634,"From the writer of No Country For Old Men, comes yet another tale about the end of the world. From the previews, I thought this movie had promise, that it would be different from other post-apocalyptic stories, but it wasn't. It's the tale of a father and son wondering aimlessly just trying to survive. Nothing is at all explained, there are weird flashbacks, and there are way too many interactions with people. Most of the world is gone, not a single animal survived, yet everywhere you go, you run into people, crazy people, most of whom are cannibals. Viggo Mortensen does give a pretty solid performance, however Kodi Smit-McPhee does not. I've never seen him in anything before, but the whole movie, he's hiding, whining, and screaming papa, it got really annoying! It was awful, I felt like they kept acting out the same scene over and over again in a different location. Nothing happens, there's no plot, and the dialogue is just stupid.

Stunningly bleak cinematography, with excellent use of flashbacks to better times. Fine, fine acting by Viggo Mortenssen and virtually all of the supporting cast. Best of all is Kodi Smit-McPhee as ""the Boy.""

I ended up purchasing the Blu-ray and then did not watch it for months. I recently put it in.

It is hard not to think about the current crop of ""Academy"" nominated films and other highly rated films of the last year, while watching this.

While The Road somewhat softened the written hammer of the book, this is nonetheless a powerful, well acted film. This film puts to shame several of the films nominated the year it was released, and continues to stand above many that have come in its wake. It is dark, it is painful, it is not fun and will not make you ""feel good."" At the same time, few films in the modern era so realistically capture human ingenuity, strength and the familial bond amidst circumstances nearly beyond comprehension.

Perhaps, that what is most important to us all in the journey is our relationships with each other. The material things that we have are not the ""stuff"" of life-but the relations are. If we strip away all the ""things"" of our normal existence-what do we have left? That is the question we all must answer. Set in a futuristic world where everything has been pretty much destroyed, the man and his son discover each other in a way they had not before. The film is not a ""feel good"" experience.

3577822,3,B001FB5634,"The Road follows a father and his son as they travel across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Road is a very dark and atmospheric post-apocalyptic drama.

The Road has a very basic story, even the characters are nameless; however, it has a deeper meaning/message, so you have to look harder to find it. The story has father and son attempting to survive and learning from each other. It mostly uneventful, except for some scenes. There is one particular scene that really got me: the father has a gun to his son's head about to pull the trigger to save him from the terror of being captured, raped, and/or possibly eaten- all while his son pleads and cries ""will I see you again?"" Aside from a few very powerful scenes, the rest of the film moves at a dreadfully slow pace with very few significant events to justify the 1hr 50 min runtime. The acting was great, and the cinematography was amazing. It is a very dark (tone-wise) and atmospheric film, although it is a bit too dark at times where you can barely see what's going on.

Overall, The Road is a decent post-apocalyptic drama with some very powerful scenes, only brought down by the very slow pace and unjustified runtime (lack of events). I recommend a rental, or a purchase if you're a big fan of post-apocalyptic films.

The Road has strong violence and blood, and nudity.",1356480000,,1339,4.617647058823529

This movie really made you have to examine yourself and ask yourself a question ""to what lengths are you willing to do what is best for your child, to protect them and keep them from harm?"" Charlese Theron acted well in her limited role in this movie and added to the emotional component that helped form the characters. Viggo Mortenson really took this role seriously as witnessed in the physical transformation he accepted as a part of this role. The child actor in this movie was also very good.

The movie is a pretty good version of it, though I found it more hopeful than the book. Didn't care for the additional scenes for the wife (Charlize Theron); not that they were bad in and of themselves - just felt like they were added out of a sense of ""we need a female character"" or ""we need some degree of love story"" rather than a story-driven need.

One caveat in terms of purchasing the movie - I doubt many people would want to see this multiple times just due to the dark subject matter. No mark against the movie itself - I just don't believe there's a lot more taken from it over repeated viewings and it is fairly depressing.

The US readies a remote, robot controlled fighter plane that can fly faster than a normal fighter jet can and murder with greater efficiency.
Trillions of dollars spent on death. With the tech of today, if people could just get along, we could provide food and shelter, etc. for the entire world. Instead we work on better ways to kill each other. I think this movie portrays what is going to happen to the world and mankind. It is well deserved.

It is a long and at times difficult movie to watch but if you really want a thoughtful and reflective experience, then there is a lot to enjoy within The Road. It is, in many places, a visually stunning film with breathtaking photography and a constant focus on the horror of living day to day with death; a sharp, clear possiblity at any given moment. And yet, somehow, through all of this, we are led to one beautific, 'golden' moment that makes everthing we have seen and endured worthwhile, worthwhile and deserved.

How original. This movie particularly was a waste of time, because really all it is was ""survival,"" so-to-speak. No zombies, even. Hardly any antangonists at all. Mostly just the threat of danger: all bark and no bite. The characters were hella lame, too. I don't know about you, but I wanted to slap the crap out of Viggo's whiny, and annoying brat of a son. What a little cry baby, for real. I found it quite unrealistic and hard to believe that a child his age would be more concerned with the moral development of his father, than with their own survival. If I were his age, and me and my dad ever survived an apocolypse, I think my dad would be the only person I would trust and I would never question his judgement.

If you have children, you know exactly what someone means when they say they would endure anything, sacrifice anything - even their own life - to protect their child. Fortunately, most of us have never been put to this test. The Road shows us what it might be like.

In a bleak, dark, and dying post-apocalyptic world, a father and son set off on a journey of survival. Life-threatening dangers, both insidious (the constant cold and threat of starvation) and gruesome (butchering by cannibals), lurk at every turn. We are never told what calamity has destroyed the earth, how civilization has ended, or what the father hopes to find at the end of the Road. McCarthy's omission of these details forces us to focus exclusively on how the father desperately fights against both the horrors of the Road and the loss of his last remaining shard of humanity, so that his son does not lose his.

It's bleak stuff for sure, and it won't be to everyone's taste, but as a study of humanity and parenthood under the most extreme conditions imaginable it's a powerful piece of cinema. There's no plot to speak of, but that doesn't matter. The film is about people not events: A father and son clinging onto each other and onto life, as they search for hope in a destroyed world.

This is a tough film for me to even talk about to other people because it was a film that went beyond being entertainment.  I'm not sure you can even call this film entertainment.

A nameless father and son trudge through a blotted, benighted, dead landscape underneath grey skies and ink black nights brought about by an unnamed apocalyptic event.  All plants and animals have died and nothing grows.  They plod along on the roads pulling a wheeled cart full of their meager foraged supplies (all resources have long gone) with a vague plan of reaching the coast- whereupon they place a baseless hope that things might be better.  Cannibalism is rampant and gangs of men roam the roads hunting for human prey.  All other people are considered killers until proven otherwise.  ""The world"" of ""The Road"" is the human race in its last gasps- on the verge of extinction.  And ""The world"" for this father and son is solely each other and each other alone.

Make no mistake, this is not a ""sci-fi"" film or a post apocalyptic adventure film in the vein of ""Road Warrior.""  This is a fable for the times.

This is a movie I'm actually selective about recommending- because it is a film that many people will never get and that some people won't be able to handle or understand.

This movie inspired me to read the book which is even more powerful and which I highly recommend.",1340841600,,1491,4.4944237918215615
3578003,5,B001FB5634,"*** WARNING: The following contains numerous SPOILERS, including discussion of THE ENDING. So if you haven't seen the movie yet and still plan to, STOP READING NOW! You have been warned! ***

How does a person even begin to rate a movie like ""The Road""? Where to start? If you have seen it, then you realize that this is quite a dilemma.

Sci-fi movies are all about ""what ifs"". What if time travel where possible? What if zombies took over the world? That sort of thing. These type of ""what ifs"" tend to fall into the following sort of broad categories:

- Cautionary Tales (usually of mankind's future)
- Moral Quandaries
- Action / Adventure
- Horror
- Comedy
- Love Stories
- Cheesy Fun / Entertainment

Now along comes ""The Road"", a movie that defies all of those categories...

Is it a Cautionary Tale? Well, not really. The movie never spells out exactly what exterminates all life on earth, sans humans (and apparently dogs). And rightly so, because there is no plausible way for this to happen. A nuclear winter might make life difficult for plant-life, but it wouldn't eradicate it. A giant asteroid that sends a dust cloud up could again, make surface life harsh. But it wouldn't annihilate it.

There are several ways that life could be destroyed on earth, but all of them involve the destruction of humans, too. The blocking of all sunlight would stop most plant life, leaving humans intact. But it would also cause a radical swing in the surface temperature, likely killing off the humans. And it would still allow mushrooms and such to grow, and the insects and small animals that eat them, which is something not depicted in this movie.

Perhaps a virus occurred at the same time, killing off many animals? This is possible. It would also allow for the fact that in this movie, corpses still decompose. Which would indicate the presence of microbial life. But how could there be life at the microscopic level, yet no animals left to eat them? And how could a surface virus eradicate all life in the oceans as well?

Don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining that the movie is not realistic. I am simply making observations. The premise of this movie cannot be taken seriously as science fiction. And it is obvious that the author did not intend it to be.

What did he intend then? Does the movie fit into the Moral Quandary category?

No. At least, not that I could tell. It tries to do this, in some ways. But this is hindered by the fact that the humans on the screen do not act like humans do in real life. Throughout history, in situation after situation, humans have proven that when catastrophes occur, moral altruism prevails. Humans often give their lives to protect others, even complete strangers. While rioting and lawlessness can and sometimes does take place, the vast majority condemn such practices. And where there is no law, good people will band together to create it. Besides, stealing a TV in a riot is a lot different from eating somebody's baby. Just sayin'.

(Some would argue with me about that, saying that they would be the first to eat my baby in such a situation. Yeah, right. I don't think so.)

The only moral quandary that might exist would be eating the dead. I don't think that reasonable people would have a problem with that, under the movie's proposed condition.

Also, the mother did not act like a real mother would toward her child. Within humans, hope springs eternal, no matter what the situation. It is ingrained in our genetics to protect our young, no matter the personal cost. Sure, this sometimes goes haywire in some parents. But when it does, the crazy type is far more likely to kill his/her entire family before suicide. I did not find the mother's actions to be realistic.

What then? Is it an Action/Adventure movie? Sort of. Not really.

Horror? Well, it is certainly horrific. But it doesn't fit that trope either.

A Comedy? Uh. No.

How about a Love Story? Now this is the closest it gets. The story is completely about the love of a father for his son. But I don't think I would tell someone ""Hey, watch The Road - it's a love story!""

Cheesy fun? No. Entertainment? Well... possibly. It depends on if you find watching the most depressing movie on earth to be entertaining.

So the movie is original. It doesn't fit the mold. Is that a good thing? You tell me.

One reviewer likened it to porn. In a way, I see his point. The movie makes you feel certain ways (in this case, frightened and depressed), exciting certain emotions for no apparent reason. It could never happen in real life, which makes you wonder why you even care. And the story is so relentlessly bleak to the point that the ending is very unsatisfying.

In some ways this reminds me of the so-called ""torture porn"", like the Saw movies. Where you know what you are watching would never happen, but it is entertaining to watch anyway. Like the macabre excitement of staring at a wreck. Without the father/son love story, this movie would truly be lost.

That is the soul of it then, the father/son story. How much does a father (or any parent) love their child? And what would they do for them? If the movie is worth watching for anything, it would be that. Unfortunately, the message is undercut somewhat by the insane/hopeless behavior of the mother. Her suicidal behavior was supposed to be rational. The father's hope was supposed to be irrational. I don't agree.

The movie was difficult to watch, in many places. I had a hard time watching the father demonstrate to his son how to kill himself. It really bothered me. It was meant to be disturbing, for sure. But why am I watching a movie to be disturbed in such a way, unless I really am watching it for some sort of ""torture porn"" effect? At least in most horror movies (which I love), there's an undercurrent of macabre humor to the proceedings. In The Road, this horror is a different beast altogether.

Bleak. Foreboding. Impossible... A kid raised on nothing but canned food for over 10 years? Cannibalistic barbarians rampaging across the countryside? And... a dog still living in those same conditions?

There are a lot of things in this movie that are hard to love. In fact, it's easy to hate.

I hated the mother for not acting like a mother. I hated the father for almost killing his son. I hated the kid for being useless. I hated when the dad made the black man strip. And I hated it worse when they put his clothes back down, but it never showed whether he found them or not. And I hated at the end when the people said they had been following the kid the whole time. For what? How creepy is that?

Especially, I hated that there was no hope given at the end of the movie. The father apparently died for nothing. Because at the end, the kid was no better off than he was before.

There's still no food source. No plants. Oh, but this lady here is kind of nice. And her kids look friendly. Oh, and here's a dog. Say, what? A DOG???

I saw potential for a hopeful ending. That was when the kid found a beetle. Finding a bug would seem to indicate life. If there's insects, then plants are to be found, somewhere... But this movie never ran with that.

The ending just left me feeling really hollow. Everything that came before, wasted. For all we know, the kid dies the next day. Hello? There's still NO FOOD.

So how to rate this movie? I don't know. I give up. The acting is top-notch. Absolutely superb. Viggo Mortensen is one of the best actors I have ever seen. His performance here is so believable that it lends a lot of authenticity to the story, regardless. He really looks like he is starving. Kodi Smit-McPhee as the kid did a good job, too. Also, I was very happy to see Guy Pierce, as always.

So for the acting and production values alone, I give it 5 Stars.

For the story, I have no idea.

Extremely depressing, post-apocalyptic movie with a focus on survival of father and son. This is not an action movie. This is more of an artsy movie that attempts to bond to the viewer. Cormac won a Pulitzer prize for the book.

3578005,5,B001FB5634,"I want to start off by saying that if you read the book and didn't like it, then you will not like this movie. They stuck as close as possible to the book, leaving nothing out. The book was a slow and reflective piece, simply chronicling the journey of a father and son in a world that is dying. There was hardly any action, so if you're looking for a violent post apocalyptic movie this is not it. If you do not like slow movies, do not watch it.

That being said, I loved this movie. I read the book, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and loved the movie for all the same reasons. The cinematography that accurately shows the dying trees, burning fields, and overall grayness of a dying Earth is perfect. Viggo Mortenson plays The Man with the effort he puts into all his movies and conveys the pain and conflict of a depressed and dying man who is only living so that his son can have a chance. And while the Boy is slightly annoying, it's understandable because he's a frightened ten year old in world of rapist cannibals. Viggo is constantly in fear of doing the most terrible thing that a father could do; killing his son to spare him the horrors of capture.

I was worried they would interject over the top action scenes or change the plot to beef it up into a real Hollywood movie, but they didn't and stuck to the story. This story is about morality and integrity. How do you keep your morals when the whole world around you has gone insane? The Man teaches the Boy about carrying the fire; the morality and warmth of the old world, and in turn, towards the end, the Boy also shows him what it truly means to be one of the 'good guys'. Even when everyone else around you has turned towards the darker side of humanity, you can still choose to be your own person and stay true to your morals.

If you like the book you will love this movie as it is as close to a recreation of McCarthy's story as possible. If you like slow depressing movies you will like this movie. As a lover of the book, I really do not have any criticisms. It is well made, has good acting, has a good message, and is a faithful depiction of the book.",1338336000,,2125,4.241975308641975

So keeping that in mind as you go thru the movie makes it all the more heart felt. It's not a happy ending hollywood movie, but there is hope in the end (to some degree). It's probably the most real life movie that's been made in a very long time meaning if this sort of apocolypse were to happen, this is probably how our world would be. I recognize that it's not a movie for everyone due to it being so emotional and at time heart wrenching and graphic.

As many others, I wondered what I would do in various circumstances, and would have done else-wise in some.  I wondered when he saw the beached ship, how he got up the side of it, and that all he salvaged was a flare gun and one flare, rather than a floating bag of food, clothing, weapons, etc.  Obviously many things were plot contrivances, but in any event, it is a movie to see for an enlightening glimpse into a post apocalyptic world, even tho it is not very realistic in some areas.",1336089600,2,760,4.492753623188406

However, all of us who are parents still face the same issues, so painfully faced by this father.  What will become of our children if we are no longer able to watch out for them?  Who will really have their best interests at heart, watch out for them, and protect them, if we are unable?  The world, as it exists today, is often a cruel, terrible place with thieves, con-men, murderers and vile beasts passing themselves off as human.  Thankfully, there ARE some good people, even strangers, who will do what is right in the face of the most terrible adversity.  There are also those who will descend into the most heinous existence, doing what they must to survive regardless of the horrors they might inflict on others, even children.

This film is absolutely outstanding, and does a great job at capturing some of the themes central to Mr. McCarthy's novel.  The acting is amazing.

Both the novel and the movie end on a promising note, but we have to wonder if that was simply Mr. McCarthy showing a little mercy for his readers by throwing them a thin glimmer of hope.  The novel and the movie could have just as easily ended as we all feared they might.  The innocent, sweet child could have fallen into the wrong hands, and died the most terrible death.

In our non-post apocalyptic world, people (even children) die every day as victims of another person's inhumanity.  Watch this film, not to enjoy but to reflect.

3578065,4,B001FB5634,"As a frequent commenter on several discussions about the book ""The Road"" I have stayed away from the film discussion but I feel it's time to lay it to rest.  Having waded through all of the posted reviews in this discussion it seems to me that the same fact should be stated for the film version as applies to the book. That being that this is a film that has no middle ground in terms of approval or disapproval.  It isn't for idle entertainment. It requires active thinking on the part of the viewer.  Some of the reviews posted here simply don't get it and do a disservice but there are many that for well stated reasons hated this film primarily because it moves slowly, it is a ""dark"" film, the characters don't act like heroes, the imagery is depressing, the reason for the apocalypse is vague at best, and many other reasons  but I think I've hit the main ones.  So if you want a film that moves along at a fast pace, has a clear and easy to follow plot, has plenty of action, has heroic, sexy, or funny characters, is mostly bright and colorful and has a resolution where all ends well, ""The Road"" isn't your film.

There are several very good reviews before this one that go into details I won't repeat again except that it's my opinion that the book's author, Cormac McCarthy, gave the film his approval for reasons other than the film being true to the book.  I was surprised when I saw the film because the film changes several key scenes, alters the time line, and omits several of the most important scenes in the book. I don't want to spoil these changes by writing about them, but if you did enjoy the film you should read the book if you haven't already done so.  It's a relatively short book, with no chapters.  So have a bookmark on hand.  It's written in a style that some have called ""stream of consciousness"" which isn't exactly accurate.  It is written primarily in the third person but there are moments when this shifts into first person from The Man's point of view.  There are several sublimely wonderful passages that appear throughout the book including a coda at the end that may not seem related to the story at first, and has created a storm of opinions since the book's publication.  The book, like the film, may seem to move slowly, particularly the first third of the book, but it sets the scene and drives home the desperation and loneliness of the world in ruin.  I can see why McCarthy approved the film as a passable attempt to convey his transcendent Southern gothic horror into a big screen entertainment product. Clearly it's wasn't going to be as popular as ""No Country for Old Men"" but even that film was controversial due mainly to the ending.

As I read ""The Road"" it seemed to be written in a cinematic style, as if he wrote it for a film, even though I don't think that his intention. But several of his previous novels were successfully transformed into films and perhaps when he wrote ""The Road"" it was in his mind.  So for a quick film review: the acting is excellent, the cinematography is realistic for the most part, although there are some scenes that I noticed trees with leaves in the background, the music score is excellent, the continuity is fair to good (although there are huge leaps in the time line), and the direction seems very good.  I have to give it less than five stars because I know too much about the story and the film tends to try to condense parts of the ending and leaves out several important scenes.  There are a few scenes in the film that aren't in the book, but that's to be expected with most book to film adaptations.  These are additions and subtractions made by the production team that may have as much to do with their budget, schedules,  and locations as with any artistic purpose or even the conceits of the stars or directors. As I've previously stated, I was disappointed that they left out several key scenes, at least two may have been considered too shocking and some alterations in the plot were unfortunate.  The blu-ray does show several out takes that were left out of the film but only one is a scene in the book that was cut and the other is an extension of the ending which the director unfortunately cut, perhaps due to time constraints. Overall it's a good adaptation but not excellent.  Please, if you enjoyed the film at all and can do so, read the book. Your library is open.",1330387200,8,4382,4.458072590738423
3578066,4,B001FB5634,"This is a story about survival of a father and son after an apocalyptic end to most of the life on the earth.

The storyline is almost identical but since the world is virtually destroyed the movie is all grey and dreary. I know that it is required to make the point that this is a major catastrophic event but it just seems so depressing that it seems to steal some of the storyline in the movie.

2. The whiny kid - In a post-apocalyptic world, you would think that a father would figure a way to harden his kid to prepare him for survival in this cruel, post-apocalyptic world.
3. People eating people - Cannibals were such a crutch in this movie. Whenever things got tense, the answer ultimately was ""cannibals""...
4. For a movie called ""The Road"", it didn't really go anywhere - I understand that the point of this movie was to be depressing and hopeless, etc. My problem with it is that you can accomplish that feeling in a vehicle that is still entertaining.

3578113,1,B001FB5634,"Yes, Yes, Yes. The Road is well acted, cinematically lush even in its sparceness, and emotionally engaging. For me, the most important question after seeing it was, ""How can such a riveting film be so blind to so much?"" The only answer I can come up with is that the book's author was blind, the screen writer was blind, the director and actors were blind, and everyone raving about the film is blind to its many serious flaws in content and imagination.

I preface the following thoughts by saying that, as a teenager, I lived through an event of some days and, to a lesser extent, some weeks similar to the devastation that provides the backdrop and apparent rationale for how everyone behaved in this film. And, people did not treat themselves and one another ANYTHING like they did in this film. Granted, my ordeal did not grind on for months and years until starvation and fatigue stripped all humanity from the minds and hearts of those who saw too much and remained alive too long. But the 1964 ""Good Friday"" earthquake that isolated communities all across Alaska, sometimes for weeks, did plunge many into a relatively deep and abiding state of privation.

So, let's first wonder what the overall point of a book and film might be that sets itself so far down a bleak chain of events that human beings are over the edge of extintion? Does anybody doubt that prolonged, extreme privation can strip us of every virtue, and reduce us to udder terror, dispair, and the inhuman treatment of others? Do we benefit in any way in our daily lives by being given such things to watch, by watch them, by feel ourselves entertained, and by praising those who made them?

If we try to decode and tease out the meaning of this film, what do we find? Do we find that demoralization in adversity is stronger than a mother's love and protective instincts for her child and husband? Do we find that a father will harm and kill others out of vindictiveness and unreasonable fear for the life of his own son? Do we find that men will band together for the sake of torturing, killing, and eating others? And this we find hypnotically entertaining?

My observation is that we are more and better than these things. In dire circumstances, I have seen a mother give her life trying to protect her children from the cold, but I have never seen one give up and commit suicide. I have seen a man harm another to protect his family but only when all hope of escape was gone. I have seen men rise to a dire occasion, arm themselves to the teeth, and become the law in the jungle, but I have never seen them do anything but help the weak and the injured.

We are a species different from others. Yes, we are addicted to the objects of our senses, but we have empathy, compassion, and creative intelligence enough to act above our addictions. When things are at their worst, we ARE at our best. I submit that the author of the book, the screenwriter, the director, and the actors in the movie have NEVER been in the situation they have created for our entertainment. I submit that, by virtue of this fact, they have no basis other than idle and ignorant conjecture for showing us a fictional depiction of their own fear and ignorance. I submit that there is no socially redeeming quality or element to this film. It teaches us nothing positive and it only sews unreasonable fear and demoralization.

When are we going to turn our backs on such things, and use the time to do what we can to bring more Good into the world?",1322006400,9,3498,4.509463722397476

Anyway, to further elaborate on the storyline, the boy and father travel through dead forests, down deserted city streets, and into peoples empty homes searching for a place to stay and doing the best they can just to survive the horrible conditions.  I believe they even mentioned the entire planet is pretty much dead with the exception of a few survivors roaming about.  Anyway, the father and son do whatever it takes to not only find enough food to make it day by day, but to make sure they don't end up getting eaten by other survivors (or as the young boy continues to say, keep away from ""the bad guys"").  Yes that's right- people eating people.  Now *that's* what I call desperate times, haha.

Some will argue that there's no story to speak of since it's just about a father and son constantly on the move and never settling into one spot to absorb the environment, however if it wasn't for the ending (which I won't spoil of course) I'm inclined to believe there *was* a story taking place.  We just didn't know where it was heading.

This is a really compelling drama with an *extremely* sad conclusion.  I won't reveal what happens, but there's a strong emphasis on human emotions.  It's an extraordinary film really.  Nothing more needs to be said- a simple story yes, but I wouldn't want it any other way.",1313625600,2,2006,4.688571428571429

Like the book, I think the film is purposely slow. However there's just enough heart-pounding moments to keep it from ever getting boring. It's quite an emotional film. Hard not to think about what I would do in the same spot. I can see how many people would welcome death in this world they travel.

Other actors are Robert Duvall, Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce. However each is in the film only 5 minutes.

If you loved ""Blade Runner,"" or are in the mood for something slow and deep and grim and meaningful and dark as hell, or just love well-made apocalypse movies, this is it.

Not a kid's movie whatsoever. A very realistic, adult, educated, and hideous view of what it would be like after a real all-out global war & the aftermath.

It is NOT about PLOT. It's about REALITY. It demonstrates what our lives would be like in this scenario: painfully plotless. If you're student of film or literature or any kind of intelligent culture, you'll probably get this; if you're not, you probably won't.

The acting, production, direction, writing, ambiance, and everything else is excellent.

The message of the film is as deep and powerful as the movie is grim and dark. Which is what it's about. Not just shallow entertainment or meaningless fluff, but the exact oppositte of those. It takes you into a world of overwhelming desolation, and then explores what really matters in such a world... and the world you might be in already.

3578144,2,B001FB5634,"I'm sure to get a lot of ""not helpful"" votes for a title like this, but whatever...

I'm giving this movie 2 stars just because in my opinion it had really high production value, it cost a lot of money to make things look that bad. And as a result, I believed in the surroundings/world/costumes. I also believed in the flashback scenes which addressed the subject/questions concerning suicide/survival vs. ""living"". And I liked the special features included with the DVD.

Warning: The rest of my review contains spoilers

But I just can't give it more than 2 stars because I did not believe the characters of the Man & Boy. And they make up like 80% of the content here.

Hollywood pretty much made a film with NO STORY. And I do enjoy character driven movies. But this one fell flat. The characters do little or no development over the course of their travels. The Boy gets more vocal concerning morals, but that is about it. It is very hard to like either Man or Boy. And I was left not caring what happens to them in the end. This film could have covered the same subjects & development in about 1/3 the time.

I guess it is possible for two such high strung and whiney people to survive this long (about 12 years) after the end of times as we know them, but no one would make a movie about them. I hated how the Man was so freaked out all the time that his first reaction to danger was to hold a gun to his kids head. This happens several times. I understand that going down in this version of the world would be better than being taken hostage and eaten. But wait to hold up the gun until danger is actually in the room with you. Geeze! And I could not believe that this kid appeared to be 12 and born after all the SHTF, but was a total loser. The flashback scenes do imply that they were able to live in a house for a long time before Momma leaves and the man-folk hit the road. But I cannot believe Boy was so sheltered by his parents that he was unprepared to survive. The Man even goes so far to bring up the subject that he will not always be around to take care of the Boy, so Boy better learn to take care of himself. Why wasn't he already trained to do that since diapers? In caveman days he would have been out doing his own thing by age 12. I just could not suspend my disbelief that far throughout the movie. I was ready to strangle the Boy by end of hour one.

What would have been a lot more interesting would have been the story of the family that the Boy joins at the end of the movie (if you believe they are even real). How long did they follow the Man&Boy? How did they go without being detected? Why where they ""worried"" about the Boy enough choose him to adopt? What were their motivations to wait to approach until the father died? How the heck did they keep a dog alive when all other animals had died? Were their kids whiney brats too, or could they pull their own weight and stand up for themselves? Yup, a lot more interesting.

Glad I got this one from the Library.

******************************************
Update a year later: I finally ""read"" the book on CD from the Library. It was a little less of a steaming pile of crap than the movie, but not by much. I can give the Man a little more respect, and Boy did come off as on the verge of death from malnutrition. But while their repeated conversations could be realistic for two people in such a state, I still could not understand WHY the book was written. NOTHING interesting happens as far as action/events, no one grows as a person, learns anything meaningful, or passes on wisdom to a younger generation. So what was the point of the story??? One of my good friends called it an extreme example of navel gazing. I have to agree. This story just didn't do anything for me on the page or on the screen.",1305763200,4,3794,4.259722222222222
3578145,4,B001FB5634,"The Road is a hard movie to recommend to people. It's an end of the world drama, 95% of the movie focuses on two characters, and there's not much action. This was a movie that I was really looking forward to back when the release date was constantly being pushed back, and now that I've seen it, I still can't decide if it's just plain ok or if it's pretty good. Fans of post-apocalypse movies might want to go elsewhere if they want action or something unique (in those cases, I'd recommend The Book of Eli or A Boy and His Dog, both are great especially if you're a fan of Fallout 3).

The movie focuses on a father and son, who we never learn the names of, as they try to survive and travel south, per the mother's request before she abandoned them to die alone in the cold of night. Some kind of cataclysmic event took place, and we never find out what exactly happened, but it devastated the world, leaving everything in ruins, trees dead, killed all the animals, and caused a lot of fires. As a result, it's survival of the fittest. Gangs of cannibals, usually with guns, travel the roads looking for victims to rob and do horrible things to before killing and eating them. As you can tell, life basically sucks for everyone. The father loves his son with all his heart, and he's the one factor in life that keeps him going. The father has a single revolver with two bullets, one for him and one for his son. He even shows his son how to put the gun in his mouth and end it all if he's in a horrible situation or just plain wants to end it all. But after a close call with a cannibal, one of the bullets is used, and that leaves one left. No one can be trusted in this world, as even people who normally wouldn't be much hassle can be a big threat to a man who has nothing left to lose but his son.

What I loved most about The Road was how perfect they got the 'end of the world' look. Absolutely everything is in shambles, and at the same time, they don't beat you over the head with the fact that life is tough here. We see how hard it is to find food when the dad is collecting crumbs off deserted restaurant tables, or when he turns finding a can of Coca Cola into a special occasion for his son, who'd never seen one before. Just like in The Book of Eli, they did a good job of showing just how precious things we do or use on an everyday basis are in a situation like this. When the man and boy make it to a house that has a bath tub and scissors to cut their hair, you'd think that it was Christmas. Scenes like this are beautiful, and as a parent, I got more out of them than people without kids might, especially the scene where the dad is reading to his son and showing him pictures of animals that the boy would never see. Little scenes like the boy admiring a deer head mounted on a wall got to me, since it's so tough to imagine someone having never seen a common deer before, and how special that would be for them. The father also carries his son a lot of times, and while many people saw this as annoying, you have to understand just how protective he is of his son. The guy has ONE bullet in a little revolver, and many of the raiders/cannibals they see have high powered rifles or shotguns. Of course he's not going to let his son trail behind him unless it's -very- safe! I also have to hand it to Robert Duvall here for giving a touching performance, and for being so unrecognizable as a lone wanderer.

But my problems are with how the movie goes- not a whole lot happens. As touching as it was to see a father and son survive and get happiness out of things like finding good food or sleeping in a bed instead of on rocks, you could easily summarize what happens in this movie by talking about the world they're in, and then how it ends. The whole middle of the movie is them traveling, with some flashbacks of life before everything went down. There are just 2 or 3 truly big threats that come their way, with one of them being extremely intense, but I personally think they could've been stretched out a little more. And the ending left a bit to be desired. While it doesn't quite lack a 'real ending', I wished that there would've been better closure, and I still felt unsure about the choice that was made by x character (I won't say who).

The blu-ray doesn't have much to offer over the dvd. Picture and audio quality are both above average, and the edge ringing artifacts were very noticeable. The film was shot with an intentional muted, grainy look to set the mood, so don't go expecting this to look crystal clear. There's a fairly good DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack, but there's not much point in having such strong audio for a movie where the audio is mostly dialogue. Special features were pretty skimpy too, with just a standard making-of featurette, commentary with the director (who even says himself that he's winging it), deleted/extended scenes and two trailers that show how poorly they handled marketing. Watch these after the movie and you'll have a laugh. Of all the info I got from the special features, my favorite was a story about how they had to keep shooting the Coke scene with different drinks in case Coca Cola didn't approve of them using their product in the movie. It got to the point where Viggo finally asked if Coca Cola said anything, and it turned out that no one actually called them, so he did it himself and got full approval.

If I could, I'd give the blu-ray a 3.5 rating, but I'll bump it up if only because I loved the visuals so much and the performances by Viggo and Kodi. The Road isn't a great film by any means, but it's definitely not bad. Maybe with a couple more viewings it'll grow on me, but we'll see. At the very least, give this one a rent.",1304121600,,5734,4.256880733944954

This was a very different movie, with the father in the movie quietly narrating the tale. It had the unusual atmosphere, and the music, and you'll definitely be entertained watching the movie wondering what's going to happen. It had the gritty realistic nature viewers claim they are hungry for, and the film certainly makes one appreciate what we have, and despite all the terror it has a positive ending. . . but I have to give the film a negative review. Perhaps I felt it was contrived (which it certainly was - watching it again and looking back on it), but the main problem I had was probably the son and how whiny and helpless he is.

Another reviewer on my friends list, a radical of sorts, claims the main problem in society today is this darn (unconscious) white male hero myth. I suspect he's being facetious, or pretending to be jealous (cause I suspect we're taught you become a hero by defending women and people of color). At least white men get to be the hero. This movie had the hero watching out for his son. Not sure he's really even a hero. At one point in the movie his son asks him, ""will we always be the good guys""? The father tells him something like, ""We'll always be the good guys no matter what"".

When the dad is holding a man he's surprised, at gunpoint in the woods, the guy tells him, ""I bet you only have one or two bullets left"", ""I don't think you'll shoot me"" ""You've never killed anyone before"". Then he makes his move on the dad and dad shoots him. I think this was a matter of getting from point A to B. To where his dad shoots the guy. If he made a quiet, Clint Eastwood move on his Dad, we might identify or feel empathy for him. But it was really stupid, when you think about it. Twelve years after nuclear war, almost everyone and everything is dead, cannibalism is rampant, and the guy tells him 'I don't think you'll shoot, I don't think you've killed anyone before'? How is it he thinks the dad only has two bullets left?

There's a line we do take seriously, I suspect. When they're running away, from the household of cannibals, while one of their victims is banging on the roof of the basement, trying to get out, I think you can barely hear them angrily yell, ""Get back down there"", ""Where do you think you're going"".

Later the pair stop in the woods, with his father saying, ""I just don't like this"". The camera looks around and we can't see anything, but they're going to travel back anyway. Fair enough. But then a hoard of cannibals noisily attacks two screaming young girls, just where we were looking. Fortunately (in the feeding frenzy they are in) none of them notice the boy and his son. It's not as if the 'zombies' jump out after the girls (and the girls aren't hidden, either), it's as if the camera jumps, like in a 'vogue' new age zombie-slasher movie.

When they run away, the dad has to carry the kid everywhere. Can't twelve year old kids run? You'd have to be Hulk Hogan or someone, in tip top shape, to be able to travel faster carrying a child like that. Don't children even in first grade have gym class and foot races?

It makes sense in the movie that the boy has grown up, after this apocalypse, because no 12 year old nowadays would be as meek and clueless as this boy. The boys purity or whatever might have been interesting, making a point of comparing him to kids nowadays, but I don't think the film took that angle. Maybe it was trying to turn us into kids that are more innocent, but I doubt it. It would have been interesting, too, if a brash 12 year old of today would have been exposed to a desperate world like this on camera. Most 12 year old kids would adapt to a world like this pretty quickly, I think. The average kid seems to almost want to be living in such a free-for all post-apocalyptic world like this. Actually, 12 years olds did grow up after an apocalypse.",1303084800,,3874,4.357340720221607

It's a well made movie, but it unfortunately relies far too much on ""Here come the cannibals, so let's hide"" as a tool to add a bit of action in an otherwise action-free film.  I liked the performances, but the script left them little room to bring their performances to a higher level.  I feel that the relationship between the father and son was well crafted, but I really don't see these two having survived for as long as they have--they react to everything, and still haven't learned to act on their own, even several years after the event that destroyed the earth.  The fact that they have just two bullets--and soon just one--is a bit contrived given the number of deserted homes that there are in the world.

The pace of the film is ponderous at best.  It plods; it doesn't move.  The father seems to want to leave a legacy behind, but soon becomes one of the ""bad guys.""  He seems to teach his son nothing about survival--only about how to kill himself properly and easily.  There are just too many things here that don't add up, or that come up empty, for me to rate this any higher.

I wavered a little whether to give it 3 or 4 stars but decided to go with 4 partly because I think it's a tad bit underrated.  I didn't read the book so can't make comparisons, but found the movie entertaining though it also felt somewhat like a typical adaptation of a good book made into a pretty decent movie - focusing more on visuals and slightly less on ideas or story - and expanding certain character roles (at least according to other sources) in order to cast bigger name actors or actresses.

The cinematography, visual effects, and realism of the post-apocalyptic world were impressive.  The film-makers did a nice job in my opinion of not using much CGI, and instead used locations in 5 different states to achieve the visuals, including run-down parts of Pittsburgh and New Orleans as well as Mt. St. Helens in Washington state (my home state!).  The movie's visuals along with its bleak feel, and some of the darker storyline that it develops, make it a fairly original (if not extremely original) film.  Overall it's decent variation on post-deluge idea and also makes you think about certain ideas that aren't necessarily bludgeoned over the viewer's head.  Also, a great cameo by Robert Duval (he's hard to recognize...and I only could tell it was him from his voice).

3578245,4,B001FB5634,"Grim, grim story that cuts everything down to the basics in a post-Apocalyptic world.  I'll only briefly go over the plot (You can get the plot from the other reviews), but I want to say that I really liked Viggo Mortenson's role as a father protecting his still decent son, and their relationship, in a near-hell of a world.

Now YOU imagine that something Apocalyptic happens -- like nuclear winter.  Decent people then have to survive.  But as the lack of food continues year after year, the worst elements of society gain power and start raping and killing families, and cannibalizing people.  How are you going to fight that?  Well if you can't, you'd better commit family suicide, or your kids are going to get raped and eaten. (A Really, really Grim thought!) This horrible thought is the chilling element behind everything in the film.  The boy's mother (Theron) realizes that they are down to only 2 bullets in the family revolver, and with the Cannibal Gangs gaining power, she instructs Viggo to take their boy down South where they might survive, then walks out into the cold forest to freeze to death.  (Grim!)  Throughout, Viggo instructs his son that if he (the father) dies, and the boy is about to be caught, to immediately shoot himself in the head before getting caught, so as not to be captured (Grim!)  In one scene they stumble across a house that has naked people locked in the basement who are about to be taken to the smokehouse (Grim!)

< Some spoilers below >
Despite this, the father's unyielding commitment to protect his son and get down South, and their human relationship, is still touching.  As is the scene when a straggler tries to steal all their stuff, they catch up to him, the father (at gunpoint) strips him of all his clothes and makes him walk away, but his son has compassion and gives the straggler back his clothes.  In the end, when the boy's father is about to die, it is very touching that he wants to ""go with him"" but the father says ""you can't.""  Then the boy becomes a part of a good family (non-cannibals).  Final message: There's hope for the human race.

It makes me sober to think that the horrible atrocities that are alluded in this movie are not necessarily fictional.  In World War 2 there were widespread atrocities commited against helpless civilians by the Nazis (well known), but equally brutally by the Japanese Army (less well known).  The Japanese treated Chinese and other civilians under their power as animals, and did a huge amount of killing, torture, rape, and even cannibalism.  In one chilling recounting by a former soldier (as documented in ""Japanese Devils"" by filmmaker Minoru Matsui), he raped a Chinese teenage girl (maybe 13-17), then casually beheaded her, cooked her flesh and fed it to his unit (!!)  So this movie could have been filmed in occupied China in WW2.  (WHEN is THAT movie ever going to happen?!)

What do I take away from after watching this film?  Hope that an Apocalypse or War of Occupation never happens, keep some extra survival gear just in case (and lots of bullets!); don't underestimate the capacity for human evil; keep strong family relationships and treasure your family, keep hope in human good;  BE ONE OF THE ""GOOD GUYS"".",1295654400,3,3234,4.713523131672598

This follows a man and son (whom we never learn the names of) who are travelling south to reach warmth and security after a nuclear war. They have to contend with hunger and lack of water, as well as roving bands of cannibalistic bandits and thieves. That is pretty much all the film is about and it doesn't have a strong plot with twists and intrigue, just this simple premise. This is shot very well and portrays the bleak landscape very well, with washed out colours and plenty of grey ash this film feels dark and inhospitable. Mortensen is excellent as the father and really carries this film, although there are great performances from the likes of Charlize Theron, Guy Pierce and Robert Duvall as well. I enjoy post apocalyptic themes to books and films, but to be honest this doesn't add too much to the genre. It demonstrates the hardships the survivors have to go through and the dangers that lurk around every corner, but it has no hope or redemption and your finish it feeling rather deflated. This may be the point of the film, to show how this kind of world would be unrelenting and hard and have no true end in sight. A worthy point to make no doubt, but a dark film to watch. This is still worth viewing, but be aware of it's dark themes and ultimate outcome and you should be fine.

3578269,3,B001FB5634,"Cormac McCarthy's stark, post-apocalyptic novel, upon which this film is based, is a masterpiece- in every sense worthy of the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for fiction which it received. One review has stated that McCarthy's primary request of the film adaptation of 'The Road' was that the book's underlying spiritual elements not be removed or softened.

  While the film adaptation of 'The Road', with it's ashen, desolate landscapes and gritty, often heart-wrenching portrayals does an excellent job of evoking the setting, feeling, and major plot elements of the original story, it falls short in exactly the way the author feared it would-- diminishing, and in some cases losing entirely the spiritual undertones of the original story. The result is a film that is often moving, yet ultimately hollow. The last 15 minutes or so, in particular, glosses over the subtle but powerful spiritual elements suggested in the novel's conclusion-- one wishes the screenplay had simply presented the final pages of McCarthy's novel 'as is', with dialog and other nuances intact. But it did not. As a result, instead of a three dimensional story that quietly speaks to some of life's great questions, we have in the end a two dimensional film that will leave many viewers feeling unsatisfied.

  ""Not nearly as good as the book"" may sound a bit cliche, but in this case it is also the truth.

3578272,4,B001FB5634,"Like a modern day ""On The Beach,"" the movie version of Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road"" takes a grisly look at the world nearly a decade after some sort of catastrophic event has turned it into a barren wasteland with what few survivors left battling for survival. Unlike ""On The Beach,"" however, you get no real sense that anyone wants to pull together, or that small communities have formed to weather the end times. Obviously, some have checked out rather than even try. Instead, ""Papa"" (a desolately believable Viggo Mortensen) and ""boy"" (a spookily innocent Kodi Smit-McPhee) are trying to make their way to the ocean in hopes that maybe the climate will be safer and warmer.

You're never given a reason why the world is dying; was there a nuclear winter? Did some sort of space detritus strike the earth ala the dinosaur extinction event? Did all those Fox News Climate Change deniers get a really nasty wakeup call? Did something happen to the Teutonic plates to cause these earthquakes and eruptions? You don't know; you only know that Papa and boy are wandering a barren planet where the only other life you see is a solitary beetle. Oh yeah, and gangs of murderous cannibal survivalists. It's up to Papa to keep boy safe, and guide him through the drifting ashes and burning landscape.

Along the way we meet the occasional other survivors that don't want to eat you, including a scene stealing Robert Duvall, who tests the father and son's humanity, and a thief who breaks Papa's resolve. While a couple of  the scenes seem forced (seeing the hunters run down a woman for killing makes no sense...if there's any chance for survival, reproduction would seem to be a priority, wouldn't it?), but for the most part, the 'every man for yourself' scenarios seem too close for comfort. With the world dying a slow death (boy's birth in the early portion of the movie puts the timeline about 8 to 10 years into the post-apocalypse), how generous would you be? Who would you trust?

This film appears to be taking place after the Rapture, when the earth is under judgment. Society as we know it has ceased to exist. In a post-apocalyptic environment a man and his son are trying to survive by any means possible. The destination is the warmer south, hopefully the environment would be more hospitable there.

Storyline/Plot:

We join a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son on the road to betterment. But are they on the right road? Or is it really better anywhere else? Bitter cold, and hunger grip them along the way. Also, they must keep moving and be very aware of others who may want to kill or steal from them.

This is a brutal film with the harsh realities that may face humanity that have rejected God in their hearts.

In the end there is really no real earthly destination that is a sanctuary for man to run to. The time of the escape has already past. It is really the final journey of lost souls as they seek to find peace and rest, but they have run away and have hidden themselves from all who now seek them.

Conclusion:

This movie can be emotionally draining, you keep your hopes up that things will improve but that is really only wishful thinking, at least until the credits start to roll. If you enjoy watching people suffering, then this may be one of your favorites.",1293580800,,1313,4.468619246861925
3578275,2,B001FB5634,"This is the most relentlessly bleak, grey, mind-numbingly monotonous movie I've ever had the misfortune to see -- and I ran it after watching ""Blindness,"" an equally dark but more violent and institutionalized end-of-the-world story.  By the end of the night, suicide would have been a step UP.

I like gritty realism, and I don't require happy endings (my favorite world-ender is ""On the Beach,"" where EVERYONE dies)... but ""The Road"" was dismal beyond belief. It was leavened by no trace of plot, enlightening dialogue, or psychological revelation. The initializing catastrophe remains a mystery; no survivors get together to even speculate on the nature of it. In the savagery that follows, the finer qualities of human nature are dismissed as, apparently, the artificial construct of a vanished civilization. Cannibalism abounds, and I challenge this assumption:  In a country where the stores & apartments in ANY city center would have stored MILLIONS of tons of food for its vanished populace (not to mention enough weapons, warm clothing & SHOES to last decades), why would the survivors descend so quickly into cannibalism? I just don't buy it. The few humans portrayed as surviving, COULD NOT have used up (or even collected & hoarded) all that would be left behind. Fagodsake -- find a Walmart, idiots.

I also don't buy that ""none of the animals survived."" If pockets of people survived, then so did some animals. Dogs and other canids would certainly have gotten through (so many would've shared human shelters) -- if only by feeding on us. (A scene like this was actually shown in ""Blindness"" -- and I found that reasonable.)

There is constant tension in this film -- but little actual suspense. The cannibals & other ""bad guys"" coming home early, became a predictable plot-device; the writers had no other vehicle for supplying actual drama. (The constant repetition of ""Papa"" isn't drama.)  And in the scene where cannibals are chasing a woman through a field, to strike down & EAT her: I challenge that premise as well. In a post-apocalyptic world, women would become almost as treasured a commodity as food & water. Virtually EVERY savage society in our past, has shown us this.

And as one viewer commented -- why leave a supply-packed shelter, to sleep in the cold rain? Is this believable, with a small boy to feed?

At the end, Viggo Mortenson lies dead on the beach, his straggly beard pointing skyward. (His death became inevitable for the viewer, as soon as that first soap-opera cough was heard.) His death was not as gripping, for me, as the director probably intended: I kept waiting to see if his adam's apple would move and give him away.

Here's how bad this post-apocalyptic ""thriller"" was:  I would rather watch Kevin Costner in ""The Postman.""",1293580800,7,2776,4.950537634408602

3578277,5,B001FB5634,"There's something about the name Eli that lends itself to post-apocalyptic films. Like The Book of Eli, The Road features a visually impaired character named Eli who foresaw the apocalypse, the younger generation brings him hope in a way he never thought possible, and Eli grapples with the question of God's plan. But what is God's plan?  That's a question that has bedeviled humanity and it is asked by an old man named Eli. It is asked in every sweep of the blasted landscape, every exchange between father (Viggo Mortensen) and son (Kodi Smit-McPhee), and in every fire lit, ""fire carried,"" and shot fired.

It's easy to dismiss The Road as too grim, as hard to watch, as a real downer, but The Road demonstrates the value of hope with single-minded determination.  The father represents the xenophobic, inward-looking, white collar fear of the world caving in.  The worst has happened, and the man flails as he tries to keep the boy alive.  The boy, on the other hand, is filled with hope and longing - he wants to make friends, he wants to play with other kids, and he wants to be with his deceased mother (Charlize Theron).  In other words, he wants to be a typical boy.

The acting is superb.  Mortensen is all too-believable as a crazed father on the brink.  Smit-McPhee is pitch-perfect as a child who alternately explores the broken world and fears it because his father fears it.  Throughout, the father tries to toughen up his son, preparing him for a hard-luck existence when he's gone. Every parent with a child can relate.

Central to The Road is a battle of ethos. Who should you be: The nave dupe who trusts anyone that says they're trustworthy?  Or the untrusting sociopath who shoots first and asks questions later? We begin life as the former and slowly become the latter...because our families, our friends, and the world teach us the folly of trust.  But it's those same people who teach us that trust is a very part of our survival. When times are tough, friends are a precious commodity.

Don't look for Kurt Russel to surf his way to freedom like in Escape from LA  or even an ultimate moral message like the Book of Eli.

If ""The Road"" were instead not an end of the world film but instead a WW2 film everything else that has come before it would be Kelly's Heroes fun but designed to entertain.

This brings a boy who doesn't know what the world used to be like, at one point you see him staring in awe at a deer head mounted on a wall and you realize he has never seen one before. He's never played with or even seen other children. His father is determined they will survive. You realize how hopeless things are when you see the age of the boy & know they have been living like this all of these years. On top of trying to find food, always traveling from place to place, they must avoid people who have turned to cannibalism. You can't trust anyone. After awhile, you start to realize that maybe the apocalypse wouldn't be quite what other movies have made it out to be. It's actually very lonely, very scary & very depressing. The ending for me was sort of sudden. I'm not saying I didn't like the outcome it just seemed as though it was too easy.

3578323,4,B001FB5634,"THE ROAD, Cormac McCarthy's disturbing post-apocalyptic novel, created for the reader a brittle, cold, callous, terrifying place, almost without dialogue, relying on just word painting.  In many ways Joe Penhall's adaptation for the screen obeys that impulse - the film is fairly quiet, allowing the horror to work its way into our minds.  Unfortunately the film thinks we cannot sustain the tension of the impossibly bleak scenario, so there are flashback moments that actually contain color - moments that focus on Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the main characters in an attempt to bring some visual relief.  Otherwise director John Hillcoat seems to fully understand McCarthy's vision and does a fine job taking us through it.

The story is simple; a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) have been wandering the blighted surface of the planet earth after the near complete destruction of life.  There are others whom they meet, some 'good guys' and some 'bad guys', but the overall force behind walking the barren planet is the need for food and warmth for survival and to avoid the possibility of cannabalism.  The man and boy walk with 'fire' inside, always heading South where they hope to find warmth.  Along the way they meet others, also without names: and old man (Robert Duvall), a thief (Michael Kenneth Williams), a gang member (Garret Dillahunt), and a family - Guy Pierce and Molly Parker.  The story has an ending - or does it?  We are left in medias res with the question of survival uncertain.

Though given the fact that he has few lines of dialogue, Viggo Mortensen manages to create a credible father and committed survivor and his acting is astonishingly fine.  Kodi Smit-McPhee likewise manages to make us believe in his character and may just become a fine actor as an adult.  The audience for this film may be narrow: few, in today's tense world situation, may wish to see the possible outcome of our behavior as custodians of this planet.  But this is a book that should have been written and a film that deserves to be seen to remind us of alternatives.  Grady Harp, November 10",1290988800,5,2133,4.8402203856749315
3578324,5,B001FB5634,"I read reviews about the movie in 2008. It was much anticipated, and, not surprising, since the book was so well-received and it garnered a Pulitzer.

I loved the acting all around. Viggo Mortenson and Kodi Smit-McPhee were outstanding. Viggo's vulnerability shone through. How to live in a dying world, but yet keep life going through his son?  He never gives up and nor does he relent. He's like Jacob tussling with the angel.

Kodi is the  paradigm of the innocence and confusion of childhood that may or may not lead to pathways of harm.

Robert Duvall, as the Old Man, brought the weariness and the sheer weight of living in a world so very changed. Death is seen as a luxury, and living is the real hell that one has to bear for the devastation to the earth. His grief for the loss of his son is tinged with guilt. One wonders if he ate his son.

The falling of the trees at once expressed the weariness of life and the anger at such great loss.

One also wonders about the loss of thumbs. I say it is a symbol of humans never civilization of any kind: hard to build, to grasp without thumbs.

I think what is so captivating is that we know that we humans would behave in all the ways portrayed. Each of us, from this vantage point, want to believe that we would be like Kodi's character and not like the cannibals. But faced with such bleak prospects would we be so circumspect?

A bearded Viggo Mortensen plays an unnamed man who wanders the world with his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) after some unspecified cataclysm has rendered the earth a vast, ash-covered wasteland, utterly devoid of animals and plants, where the sun and sky have become perpetually obscured by a shroud of smoke and clouds encircling the planet.  The few remaining humans have been reduced to roving bands of armed survivors who often resort to eating one another to survive.  The man and his son must constantly stay one step ahead of such people, becoming more and more isolated in a world where to trust someone or to extend the hand of friendship to a stranger could mean the end of one's own life.

Yet, as much as possible, the protagonist attempts to rise above their dire circumstances, holding onto as much of what makes us human as he can without endangering himself and his son in the process.  He still feels a need to instill a sense of hope and basic human decency into his child, values rooted in his own memories of a time before the catastrophe, just prior to the lad's birth.  Thus, even as they are dying of starvation, Mortensen teaches his boy how to distinguish the ""good guys"" from the ""bad guys,"" and how to live by a code of ethics that may be as antiquated and useless as the dilapidated buildings and rusted-out vehicles that lay strewn across the landscape through which they travel.  But can even he tell who the good guys and the bad guys are anymore?  Or is he becoming as callous and inured to the suffering of others as those he fears and warns the boy against?

Though ""The Road"" definitely doesn't sugarcoat its material, it does provide some moments of warmth and deep-seated emotion to help mitigate what would otherwise be unrelieved grimness.  These come in the form of random acts of generosity and kindness doled out to strangers the two meet along the way (Robert Duvall being one) and in moments of extraordinary tenderness between a father, who fears for what will happen to his boy when he is no longer able to take care of him, and a son who can only imagine what life was like in the time before he was born and who has implicit faith in the man who has vowed to love, guide and protect him from the hardships of life.

In addition to the three previously mentioned actors, the movie also features Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce in key minor roles.

If nothing else, ""The Road"" is a masterpiece of production design, art direction and cinematography, one that perfectly creates a world almost totally denuded of color, where all we see comes in various shades of grey (principal filming was done in Oregon, Louisiana and Pennsylvania).

This ineffably sad and haunting film may be just too bleak for some to stomach, but for those able to see beneath the surface gloom, it offers hope that one can retain one's humanity in even the most inhuman of worlds.",1286928000,2,3333,4.70446735395189

As a huge fan of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/B003WSKS9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">[The Road</a>], I was very excited about seeing this movie!

The movie experience is not nearly as gripping as the book in my opinion, but let me explain -

1. If you read the book first, you will not enjoy the movie as much. Why you ask, because you already know all the surprises, you already know what's coming next. Whereas when you read the book, you were blown away everytime something so unimaginable happened, that you couldn't believe it.

2. If you haven't read the book, you will enjoy the movie if your prepared for what for about to see. The movie doesn't have alot of dialogue, it has basically no color. It's not black and white, but its very bleak and grim in the world of ""The Road"" and its not very pleasant.

Alot of people that have seen this movie loved it, for its originality and for Viggo Mortensen's acting. The man is amazing, he really gets into this role and nails it.

This movie will surprise you and its one of those movies you don't want to have missed when everyone is talking about it.

I was going to give this picture a lower rating until I realized that it's supposed to be a downer.

...if your family likes eating other families, perhaps. But for those of us who tend towards the non-cannibalistic, The Road might just be the most depressing movie ever made.

McCarthy's book is harsher than this, mainly because it takes a lot longer than 110 minutes to read. For me the best thing about the film of it was that I knew it must at some point end. I agree with those who find Viggo's acting excellent and that the movie is very true to the book, but all considered I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but those who love deep, deep pessimism and gloom.

[Spoilers aplenty to follow...but then this whole movie is almost the ultimate cinematic spoiler.]
The main thing most fans praise in the book and film is the (unnamed) Man's deep love of his son. Granted, it's there, and is shown with much conviction and intensity. But if the overriding message is that the love we have for our families trumps all, then the lack of love the Man has for anyone but his son is equally dispiriting. His son has to almost force him to show any care whatsoever for the thief and the old man. Sure, to help strangers is to risk the survival of his son and himself...but to what end? They seek ""good people""...but the Man seems to be good people to his son and no one else. This story feels like it wants to be a sort of Christian allegory, yet consciously begs the issue of what exactly separates good people from bad. Surely that line is crossed far before cannibalism is resorted to.

Is the message here that the only love that really counts is love for our immediate kin? In a post-apocalyptic world where the continuation of our DNA is a tenuous proposition at very best, isn't love for life in all its forms, and mankind in all its misery, the main redemptive force? Letting others die so that you may live is not much better than eating other people, is it? Maybe I'm missing something here, but The Road seems to have nothing positive whatsoever to say about life, except perhaps that when push comes to shove we'll do almost anything for our families' survival. But we already know that. Other works of art have gone far beyond that point to show how a literally Christ-like love of all people transcends the self-centered love of those we are kin to. Shrouding the opposite thought in non-stop pathos hardly redeems the notion.

Director Hillcoat does everything he can to make this the grimmest-looking film of all time (thus making the blu-ray pointless, unless high-def misery is your goal). Not once is there a tiny ray of sunlight; that might suggest some sort of optimism, and then where would we be? We might end up having a good thought, and that's not allowed here. The only good thought possible is that the Man loves his son. And that's it. By the end, I felt cheated in many ways by that refusal to let these characters have any lightness whatsoever. (Except maybe when they find the coke and the del monte etc cans...that product placement was so weirdly glaring, featuring the only color in the film. I would love to have seen the PP salesman pitch this to the companies: ""Hey, we'll give you full color saturation in this grayest of movies, and your Brand will seem like the Second Coming!"" Irony on a whole other level.)

History shows over and over that people have a sense of humor, often at the most unfunny of moments. It's what makes us people, as much as our love for our families, I'd venture. Read the story of mankind and you'll find rays of moral and ethical light in the darkest of places and hours. But such humanity is basically forbidden here in any way. And to what end? When the film was over I could only shake my head at how little redemption of any sort there was. The whole point of showing darkness in art, to my mind, is to show how we as people can rise above it. The Road seems to say, it's okay to sink as low as you must to save your family. But what about the family of man?

For all its perfect depiction of total despair, along with Mortensen's fine acting, I can't think of any reason to possibly recommend watching this movie, unless you loved the book. And even then the movie offers little that isn't already in the novel. Yes, watching others suffer makes our own problems seem smaller by comparison, but I can think of hundreds of other films that offer the same message along with some real beauty and even occasional redemptive joy tossed into their pits of gloom.

Too real to be a ""fun"" zombie-cannibal flick and too unrelentingly depressing to be any sort of pleasure to experience, The Road is like watching a car accident in verrry slow motion. I would say that if you really need to know how bad life can be, go down to your local homeless shelter and see how close today's real life is to post-apocalyptic for actual people in your town, right now. And then maybe show them some of the love shown by the Man to his son here.

I settled on four. .......(shaking head) I've never read the book so all I knew about the movie was a guy and his kid survive the end of the world and that was about it. They never say what it was that ended the planet. I'm guessing it was some kind of bomb but all that's left is man. No animals. No crops. No trees. Nothing.

Within the first ten minutes of the movie I was in tears and I knew I'd be in for a rocky ride. I WAS NOT prepared for what this movie threw at me.

Ok, the good. Why would I give the movie five stars? Excellent acting, incredible score. The movie sucks you right in and doesn't let go.
The direction is brilliant. The pacing is slow but deliberate and very effective. The movie is a masterpiece except for....

The bad? Why would I give one star? Umm....I don't know how many of you have played the Resident Evil video games but when you stumble upon a big scary mansion looming in the mist, RUN THE OTHER WAY. Chances are said mansion will have scary, icky things in it.
And the mansion part of this movie will haunt me for years to come. YUCK! Not that this part of the movie is gory, it kind of is. It's the mental impact of what is happening in the mansion and really all over the Earth. This movie is the darkest, most depressing, desolate thing I have ever seen and I never want to see this movie again.

I settled on four stars. The movie is a masterpiece and one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It's not even technically a horror movie but that's what kind of impact it had on me. I guess what really scares me the most is the fact that this entire scenario is possible. Funny....that great thing we call the mind of man is what has elevated us from the club wielding/rock throwing days to where we are now as a species. It will be the same mind of man that reduces us right back to where we originated, maybe even worse if this movie is any indication.

I pray the bombs never fly during my lifetime but if they do. I know where fallout shelters are... I won't be going. I'll go right outside and welcome the end with outstretched arms. Even if you did survive, what kind of life would be left for you or your loved ones? Is that really something you'd wish on them or yourself?

If the end really was as bad as this... My prayers for the survivors. Imagine a planet filled with Ted Bundy's and Jeffrey Dahmers running around in gangs. For those who say ""This could never happen"". It already has. Go read about Holodomor in Ukraine. People can and will revert back to their most absolute brutish ways in very little time under the worst circumstances. ...Maybe this wasn't the best movie for me to watch. I cry during car commercials if the music is sappy enough. This movie will stay with me for years to come. Excellent job by Mortensen, Theron and the boy.

Do I recommend this movie? If and that's a HUGE IF you can stomach the subject matter of a post apocolyptic world filled with murdering cannibals, then yes. Otherwise I'd say for sensitive viewers, don't watch it. It's a masterpiece of utter brutality, desperation and hopelessness.

The film is very minimalist, but not cheap looking. Too light on the background info. What's w/the thumbs??? The central theme of retaining humanity amidst the threats is maybe too subtle (biblical, blinding Eli is about as clear as they made it). I've never read the book. I think perhaps that a book is more ideal for this type of story. After watching the film two times? I'm not left feeling entertained, emotionally affected, or intellectually stimulated. Something is missing from this project. Like I said. i think this theme would be far better served up in book form. As an aside. I again wish the Libertard backers of these films would consult w/KNOWLEDGEABLE weapons experts. Handgun, flare pistol, & compound bows in this case. The more realistic you make it?

The Book of Eli and I am Legend have hero-centric myths attached to their plots, which make the films cartoony, mere dabbling in the post-apocalyptic genre.  There's nothing goofy about The Road.  It is a sustained embrace of a nightmare world where the soul is all but wrested from the clutches of humanity.  One of the pitfalls of the movie is that I cannot imagine wanting to watch it again.  It's a depressing and hopeless trudge for survival and basic necessities.

If you can handle the content of the film, you can take a step back and see the beauty in the direction, photography, and cinematography.  The world of the film looks utterly alien, a battered and starved America.  There's very little color in the film, and so when they do appear, colors are mysterious and seemingly out of place, almost haunting.  For these reasons, I recommend the film.

3578425,4,B001FB5634,"Post apocalyptic movies usually fall into just a couple categories when it comes to the plot. Of course they all evolve around the world as we know it ending in some disaster, but after that what do the survivors do? The Road is the kind of movie that delves very deeply into that kind of thinking. Other PA (Post Apocalyptic) movies use this mostly as window dressing for the basic plot devices often found in this kind of movie. The Road ignores those rules and ends up with a pretty disturbing, outright depressing, but strangely satisfying sci-fi film.

So what happened? Maybe Mother Earth got tired of the bullcrap and started tearing everything up. Maybe those crazy humans ""finally did it"" and suddenly wrecked the planet in the process. Let your imagination go wild on how. The movie doesn't really say. That's the beauty of it too. Instead of having the audience fixate on some exposition on what happened before the start of the movie we are pressed to focus on what's going on now with the end result. It also keeps us from focusing on how to fix it or coming up with ideas on how to overcome it. We are stuck with the players in this film as to how to survive.

And that's where the plot comes from. This movie doesn't really follow the standard PA plot of having some overlord of the wasteland to overcome like The Road Warrior or The Postman. There is no mystical haven to find like Waterworld or to a lesser extent Cyborg. There is no solution to save the world like Reign of Fire or Children of Men. Technically there is no plot at all. It's more like a series of events that transpire in the lives of our intrepid father and son duo. The real story is behind the relationship with father and son, and if you are a dad this movie will move you. It's all about their actions and reactions to their surrounding situations and between themselves. You get some good character analysis with this movie.

This movie could have gone in many different directions, but it instead stays on a very dedicated track. Director John Hillcoat could have made this a very different movie. There are roving bands of raiders with a penchant for cannibalism, yet the violence and gore are downplayed. Less is more in this movie, and it gives you that chance to use your imagination on what kind of imagery and acts happen off-camera. Other directors may have taken this subject matter and milk if for all the sensationalism they can get (I'm talking to you Emmerich and Verhoeven).

The direction the movie did go I'm afraid isn't any easier to stomach for some viewers. This world on the film is bleak with very little happening to be encouraged by. Even the ending doesn't really give you that much sign of hope if you're looking for something to tie things up nice and neat. In spite of all of this The Road gives you a lot to think about regarding morality vs. mortality. If you aren't afraid to be challenged to think about such things then in the end this movie not only gives you a satisfying ending it also gives you a lot to think about.

Technically speaking the movie looks wonderful. The location shots they picked really sell the end-of-the-world feel of the story and there was very little digital manipulation of what you see. Sound queues take a more important role in this film as the noises both subtle and obvious take part in telling the story. Acting is great. Vigo Mortensen really threw himself in the role, but then again that's what he normally does in every role. The cast selection hits home on this movie.

This Blu-Ray looks pretty good and sounds pretty good, but don't expect to be wowed by the presentation. This movie is full of greys and a subdued soundtrack anyway so it wasn't meant to be a reference film. This is one of those disks that bugs you with a mess of previews when the disk plays (Sony... just stop force feeding us your blasted commercials). The extras are slim pickings with not much to make it stand out over the DVD release. Here's the list:

Audio Commentary: Kind of off the cuff, but does go into the book the movie is based on among other things. The director even admits not really being prepared for doing the commentary, which still makes this a better commentary than many.

The Making of The Road: A relatively short, but sweet documentary that focuses on several aspects of the film with a good amount of detail for a featurette running under 15 minutes. They talk about the book, the actors (including some intruiging tidbits from child actor Kodi Smit-McPhee) and even some production details.

Deleted and Extended Scenes: These are mostly short clips so there wasn't much taken out. Not really a whole lot we missed without it being in the film. Although one delete/retake did have some details that would have raised some interesting water cooler discussions about the ending for those paying attention.

Theatrical trailers: Two of them that don't really get the true feel of the movie. I remember seeing one of them on TV before seeing the movie. If that and that alone was what I wanted to see from The Road I would have been sorely disappointed. No wonder the movie didn't do well in the box office in the states. Now you can see why.

BDLive: A BR exclusive and is something I never really attempted to play with for any movie... ever.

MovieIQ: About the only semi-useful BR exclusive on this disk. When active it gives you a mess of background info on the movie, cast, soundtrack, etc.

The Road is one of those deep movies that challenges you to consider things most people normally don't want to. The Fountain is another such movie. The father/son dynamic is definitely something for the dads. If you're an action or comedy junkie this isn't the movie for you. Drama fans who can get into subtle character development can get into this movie. Serious sci-fi fans may eat this up due to the world-changing environment and implications.

3578427,4,B001FB5634,"Is the struggle to stay alive more important than the struggle to keep your humanity alive? The cannibals had found an answer to that question: Yes. The cannibals had chosen to survive over being people--they had let the fire die.

At first I just thought this notion of mass canibalism to be nonsense, that in such an event some framework of order would emerge, some basis of society would not relinquish itself. Than I was leaving a basball game and fighting the hoardes in traffic and I realized that I am a fool. If those jackasses would sacrifice their humanity in as much as screwing everyone else over to squeal out of a parking lot and get onto a highway a few minutes early, they would surely suck the marrow from my bones--in the event of total societal collapse.

3578428,5,B001FB5634,"Because I was so enamored with Cormac McCarthy's powerful and riveting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/novel/dp/0307476316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">novel</a>, I wondered often if director John Hillcoat's film adaptation would do the book justice.  Having viewed THE ROAD several times, plus watched the DVD extras, I would say justice is duly served.  Not only does Hillcoat vividly recreate the stark, cold, dirty, brutal environment of a post-apocalyptic world, what's even more important is he wonderfully portrays McCarthy's moving theme of a father's undying love for his young son.  It's compelling cinema, and Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee make a dynamic team.

While Hillcoat does take some extra liberties (the mother's role, played by Charlize Theron, is very much expanded from the novel), for the most part he stays faithful to McCarthy's story.  In fact, via the DVD extras we learned McCarthy was involved in much of the filmmaking process, and gave his approval to the final version.  We also learn that Mortensen was so committed to his role as the homeless Man (his character and Smit-McPhee's have no names) he actually lived and slept in his filthy clothes for days at a time (he got thrown out of one or two stores as a result).  And rather than depend on CGI effects for the bleak landscape, Hillcoat took crew and cast to literally dozens of locations, from Mount St. Helens to rural Pennsylvania to New Orleans and many points in between.  This creates a vivid, gritty realism.  One drawback (if one can call it that) is Hillcoat's audio commentary; at best it's disjointed and rambling and sometimes confusing.  (Thankfully Hillcoat's a much better director than he is a commentator.)

Scattered throughout the film are supporting roles performed admirably--especially acting legend Robert Duvall in a powerful appearance.  Guy Pearce and Molly Parker are memorable as well.  Having watched THE ROAD it comes as no surprise the film garnered McCarthy's seal of approval; this is a commanding film that captures the spirit and intent of the sensational novel.

3578449,4,B001FB5634,"This is a moving story of true love in the face of desperation.  Not one to watch if you're in the mood for something light-hearted, but it will make you think again about how you relate to those you love.",1282694400,,205,4.125
3578450,5,B001FB5634,"Given my review of the novel, I feel compelled to offer some words on the film, which I've only now just gotten around to seeing.

Of course the book is better; I never had the slightest expectation any film would be able to fully capture the fear, despair and wrenching love that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Road/dp/0307476316/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Road</a>&nbsp;delivers.  That being said, this is a very good film telling of this story.  The design and production are outstanding, as is the acting.

Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-Coen-Brothers-almost-verbatim-take/dp/B00118T63C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the Coen Brothers' almost verbatim take</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/0307387135/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>, this film does stray somewhat from the magnificent original.  There are a few aspects of the story that are rearranged temporally, but the original book ""feel"" survives.  The wife/mother gets a lot more play, and the ending is considerably less ambiguous than what the book offered.  Other than that, this is the bleak, grim, straightforward story of the road.

I was very relieved to see the awful, quick-cut video disaster footage from the trailer was nowhere to be seen in the film.  There was no F/X-laden montage setup or other predictable, dumbed-down glop pandering to viewers' meaningless need to see/know the nature of the apocalypse.  It doesn't matter one bit how we got to where we are; man and boy are stuck in it, and the father decides they have no choice but to push on.

The F/X was consistently good, necessary for the narrative and not over-the-top.  Unlike the novel, where the massive cloud cover blotted out the moon and stars at night, making them ""casket black,"" the film necessarily offers some ambient lighting, just so we can see what was going on.  I was also relieved to see no green whatsoever in the wasteland scenes; the dusty or alternately gray, sodden, ashen bleakness of the daytime world was perfectly presented, consistently.  As the film progressed there were slight changes in lighting of characters and scenes, slight breaks in the clouds, etc., another tiny little sliver of hope edging toward the end titles.

The incredible, clammy, pervasive fear of the book came through, but not nearly as powerfully as in the novel.  We got the cannibalistic bad guys in a number of contexts (sadly coming through consitently as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/B000RTB0R6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>-like gomers), but a number of the scenes just didn't successfully communicate the extent to which the man would undertake security measures for overnights; on two separate occasions the man and the boy sleeping in the open in abandoned vehicles.  That's easy for the viewer to take in, but is inconsistent with the nature of the threat; it does serve, though, as an important plot vehicle early on.

The acting was fantastic.  I was struck by the closeness of scene after scene, and I couldn't help but think of the lifelong bond that actors Mortensen and Smit-McPhee must have formed during what was likely and necessarily unpleasant, highly emotional filming.  Good on that young man for his performance, and the courage it took to do it.

As I said of the novel, this is about abiding, unconditional parental love for and absolute dedication to a child.  It's about the nature of humanity, whatever that exactly is, and the choices one makes in the face of true doom to live honorably and ethically, and whether such a notion actually has any meaning or relevance, given the circumstances.  There are many issues and questions in this film, as in the book.

Bottom line: This film could never be the book, so there should be no expectation of that.  If you liked the book, you should enjoy this film, as it is thoroughly faithful to it, with excellent attention to the details that made the book so powerful.  It is a superb rendering, with powerful acting from man and boy.  It is a dark and harrowing story, with the slightest of hint of happy ending; this is not a film to make you feel good, and it's unlikely you will watch repeatedly.",1282348800,5,4391,5.56390977443609
3578451,5,B001FB5634,"I just rented this movie, have already watched it twice, and wow, what a powerfully emotionally moving movie it is, akin to ""Eli"", and actually I wondered if there was some sort of relationship with ""Eli"", cause Robert Duvall's charactor is named Eli.
Well anyway, this is a good turorial on good people versus bad people, and I suspect we all have encountered folks who would turn outrageously bad given no laws to restrain them, the sometimes so called ""successful"" folks, the supposed ""winners"" of society who are absolved of guilt if they turn out an old lady or family out onto winter streets if they are even a couple days late on the rent, cause hey, if its about money, anything goes it seems.  Only interesting point is most of those types of folks have no survival skills if they don't have money to purchase things, they either won't be in a post apocalyptic survival scenario, or they will take the easy route of cannibalism.

Eventually I would like to add this movie to my library, I mean, why wouldn't anyone, because of the excellent acting in the movie from every actor/actress, I mean, if a movie can almost drive you to tears, that is truly a movie experience, and I was similarly moved with ""Eli"".  I'll have to wait till it comes down in price, just like Eli.

Now, cannabalism is something that humans have been known to do throughout history, the chinese had a famine in the 1960's and it happened in its most rural hardest hit areas, along with it having been accepted throughout history in chinese culture where they could trade their children off to be eaten for food or eat them theirselves(I am referencing the book ""Maneaters"", a good reference for this type of thing, but they reference cannibals as predators in that book, it always seems children or women are snatched by cannibals.  Cannibalism happened in the Ukraine in the 1930's when Stalin had their crops destroyed to suppress opposition to communism.  I wouldn't want to be a cannibal, with all the modern diseases, to even include deadly brain diseases, not even cooking human flesh for more than five minutes at 140 degrees fahrenheit would get rid of that K-Jacobs brain disease(otherwise known as mad cow disease).

Some confusing points of the movie, like who was that man who shot arrows, was it the one they had just encountered(trying not to give spoilers).  Also, radiation, from fallout, I am sure it had to be bad but one really can't tell.",1281916800,,2441,4.70023419203747

Viggo Mortensen is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. He doesn't have Johnny Depp looks or an air about him, but he is a superb actor. In this role and every other I've seen him in.
The movie is graphic, gray, and at times terrifying...but the acting, sceenplay, and effects were all still phenomenal. I would watch this movie if you want food for thought and deep-set emotional drama, not if you want something happy and fulfilling.",1281830400,,723,4.612403100775194

3578454,4,B001FB5634,"This is a really bleek film with some harrowing scenes of holocaust survivors reduced to cannibalism to survive.
I think it's great that the producers of the film sought out sympathetic scenes of destruction and desolation (Mt St Helens, etc)rather than resorting to computer graphics.  This placed all of the cast under great pressure - particularly Viggo Mortensen, who is an indomitable spirit - and who undertakes the role of teaching his son - played by Cody Smit-McPhee to survive him, that is, to discover the fire within himself. But for all the transcendental love which Mortensen's character shows, it is clear that he is deluding himself in a sense, for his son is far too vulnerable and too young to fend for himself. The boy is just an albatross around his father's neck, but the father's love will not be extinguished. The son presumably represents an idealised human spirit, and his father will undergo unspeakable hardships to promote the next generation.  What irked me was having to listen to the boy implore his father with the words, ""Papa, papa"" far too many times throughout the movie. I understand this is a homage to Cormac McCarthy and his own son, but it really grated.  But for this, an excellent film, far more engaging than Day of the Triffids (!) Recommended",1281571200,,1288,4.845454545454546
3578455,4,B001FB5634,"With the timing of this movie and ""Book of Eli"" being released so close together, and both dealing with a post apocalyptic, dystopian view of the future, it's difficult not to compare the two side by side. But whereas Eli, represents a more polished, Hollywood style approach, The Road is a dark, and dreary adaptation without any real moments of levity. Arguably, the book (which I have not read) doesn't translate too well here into a movie, you feel somewhat dropped in to a portion of the story, where the beginning is shown only in often confusing flashbacks without real explanation, and the rest of the story sort of meanders into desolation, but perhaps this is the intention. Like Eli, the film is heavily tinted, everything looks lifeless and grey, dead or dying, and the devastated landscapes and cities are very well portrayed. Mortensen as the main character, leading his son, on their trek ""South"" to the ocean, is as intense as ever, ragged, emotionally dogged, but resolute in survival, and tenacious in protecting his son from the horrors along the way.
It's a difficult film to like, I would say that I would be unlikely to watch this again for a long time, so I was glad I rented it first. It's also not a film to cheer you up, and whereas that's sounds like an obvious comment considering the subject matter, like the film itself, it seems relentless in piling on the futility, and misery.
So why 4 stars? Well the performances are excellent, particularly from Kodi Smit-McPhee as the son. It's also a lesson in humanity, where materialism and money has no value, a wake up call we could all do with from time to time. I also liked the tension and horror aspects of the movie, the marauding gangs, cannibalism and death being often played out off camera, or just with sound, not overtly graphic, but often even scarier most of the time.
The message of the film, I can't say. It's quite slow and feels long despite being just two hours, and as I said at the beginning almost stops before the story ends.
Difficult to categorize, but still a great movie on many levels.",1281398400,2,2087,4.643243243243243
3578456,5,B001FB5634,"When I first rented this movie and popped it into my dvd player, I didn't really have a clue what to expect. I still didn't even a good bit into the movie. Even about 20-30 minutes in, I still didn't know if I was going to regret spending the money and time on this rental. When the movie ended, I knew it was worth every minute and every cent.
  Now I will tell you all why I loved this movie. First, you can easily tell by watching the movie that the director was following his own vision, and not trying to appeal to a mainstream audience. Yes, it is rather bleak and depressing, but that only adds to the movie and the experience. The acting is incredible, and all the characters, even though none of them have names, are very fully realized and highly developed. The movie follows a style that reminds me of the book The Hobbit- the main characters are on a long, treacherous journey, and experience and series of separate and clearly definable events. You are constantly wondering what the characters are about to go through next. The movie also makes you realize that post-apocolyptia sucks, and unlike in the game Fallout 3, there aren't guns everywhere and food is extremely scarce, and viciously fought over.
  I really liked this movie. You should probably watch it if it sounds interesting to you, but I also think this movie certainly isn't for everyone.",1281312000,,1367,4.56734693877551
3578457,5,B001FB5634,"I think it may have been unfair to even think about reviewing this film.  Cormac McCarthy's novel is, in all honesty, the greatest novel I have ever read, and I read a lot.  I know that it has many detractors, but the simplicity that illuminates the savagery he creates is just beyond flawless in its execution.  No single novel has stirred me in so many different ways.  So, when it was announced that this film adaptation was in development my initial reaction was that of immense joy.  I could not wait.  And then the film was delayed and that always worries me.  Then the critical response was lukewarm and not what I was expecting.  I understand the oppressive bleakness with which the story unfolds can be a deterrent for some, but I really was expecting a very warm critical response (especially considering that director Hollcoat's previous effort was `The Proposition', which is the single greatest western of the decade).  The reviews came in and I sidelined my anticipation and moved on to other, more critically accepted fare.  In the back of my mind I was still aching to see this film, but the constant thought that I was setting myself up for disappointment haunted me.

Finally, I caved in.

I'll say first off that this film is not as strong as the novel (by any means really) but it is far from a weak effort.  There are many elements that work masterfully here (not the least of which is Viggo Mortensen, who just commands with such authenticity) but there are also a few that don't.

The story is a simple one.  A father and son (in the novel referred to as The Man and The Boy) are trekking across the barren wasteland that is earth, in search of the coastline.  Their main objective is to survive.  The men and women still alive are either good (like our man and boy) or have turned to cannibalism and thievery as a way to survive.

Simple as that.

For me, it is the ambiguity and open-endedness of the story that makes it so compelling.  I have heard some complain about not knowing all the details (How did the apocalypse happen?  Why did The Woman kill herself?  What awaits them on the other side of survival?), but for me, these questions do not need to be answered.  In fact, my biggest complaint with the film is the attempts to answer some of them.  For me, the flashback scenes that `build' the relationship between The Man and his wife are unnecessary and take one out of the film.  If the film had been stripped of all flashback sequences except the one where she leaves (because that is a central emotional point in the novel as well as the film) then the narrative flow would have been better (in my humble opinion).  The Woman is not important here.  The knowledge of her existence and her suicide are very important, but the foundation that supports her memory is not.

As some have mentioned, the stories progression on the written page depended on the imagery created by McCarthy's words.  A sliver of that is lost on the big screen.  Some stories are just not well suited for a film format.  That said, I don't think it's a big enough slice to really dampen the films impact.  The imagery that is created by Hillcoat and company is not as sharp as Cormac's pen, but they are spellbinding in their own right (depictions of the aftermath is at times shocking to behold, and completely surreal).

But there are some big selling points found within this film, which include some tremendous performances and Hillcoat's spectacular direction.

Mortensen is utterly brilliant here.  The character of The Man is a tricky one because, for me, it is one of those characters that is so rich for development but could easily (in the wrong hands) become one-note.  Mortensen breathes so much humanity into this man.  The way he tackles his instincts (to survive and protect) with his own selfishness (the way he handles finding his old home was flawless) as well as his nostalgia (giving us the tormented looks at his happy love life as well as his affectionate response to something less emotionally demanding, like a whiskey) is all simply perfection.  Kodi Smit-McPhee also handles his character with authenticity.  One may initially balk at the way he reacts to certain things around him, but understanding that this boy knows nothing but the life he is living (with the apocalypse happening while he was still in his mother's womb) will help us understanding his emotional state.  While I strongly favor Max Records performance in `Where the Wild Things Are' (not THAT is how you play a kid), I must say that Smit-McPhee did not disappoint me.  Even when I found him underselling the moment (that final scene with his father could have pulled more heartstrings if he pushed it a little more) he also sold his characters frustrations exceedingly well at time (""YES I AM!"").

Toss in a very seasoned and memorable cameo by Robert Duvall and you have a film with some poignant performances.

The musical score also worked very well here, building tension when needed but also baiting our heart when needed (the final moment, on the beach, with the simple yet stirring score looming in the background brought a slew of tears to my eyes).  Hillcoat crafted a very tightly woven film, one that felt completely within itself, which worked very well for the concept and the impact it set out to make.  Everything looked and felt real.  The wasted away bodies of the people wondering the road; the ash covered scenery and looming desperation captured in every collapsed remnant of a civilization past was spot on.  The way the script was written was also a plus, for it fleshed out the internal struggle that is so pertinent to understanding McCarthy's vision.

Yes, it is flawed, but not so deeply that it isn't well worth experiencing.  The film is a downer, one that is as bleak as they come, and yet there is a hope presented to us that touches the heart.  While it fails to `perfectly' render Cormac's masterpiece to us, it is still an extremely good film that deserves to be received as such.

I have no hesitation in giving this film an A-.",1281052800,,6071,4.653521126760563
3578458,3,B001FB5634,"It is an upbeat movie for a post-apocalyptic tale where there is no food except can goods and grains (which are increasingly harder to find) and other humans.  I haven't read the book, but it must be the prose that makes the book great. The movie sets the tone flawlessly. The sets are great. The atmosphere is gloomy. Everything is pretty much shades of gray. Viggo does a great job. Charlize Theron is very good. The boy is good. He is a little too cherubic for starving to death, but he is good. Robert Duvall has a bit part and he is great. The relationship between the boy and father seems real.

My only criticism was the plot. You never know what happened to world that caused almost every living thing to die, but left scores of humans alive. Plants were dying. No animals were seen except at the very end: a beetle, a bird and a pet dog. How did the pet dog survive? The movie was relentless and the end seemed almost too happy. The images and some of the conversations were striking.

The movie is hard to watch and it is hard to recommend. Is is worth two hours of someone's life to see such a hopeless movie? The acting and production values are excellent, but the pacing is slow at times and the movie just grinds on relentlessly like Viggo's character who grinds on and he is not sure why.",1280793600,2,1303,4.331967213114754
3578499,5,B001FB5634,"_The Road_ (2009) is an excellent film based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy.  The film focuses on the relationship between a father and his son as they attempt to survive a post-apocalyptic world.  The father and son travel along a dangerous path and meet the few survivors on their way.  Gangs of cannibals chase them along the way and manage to capture some of the few other survivors.  We learn that following the apocalypse the boy's mother has committed suicide by walking alone into the woods.  The surroundings are bleak and desolate and few people remain along the way.  Eventually the boy and his father meet up with an old man who has gone blind.  The boy begs his father to help him so they give the old man some food.  They continue along their way and manage to find an old farmhouse where they stay for the night.  Eventually they make it to a beach where they meet another man who the boy begs his father to help.  However, the father decides to leave him alone.  Along the way the father is injured and is slowly dying.  The father tells his son that he carries the ""fire inside"" and that his son must go on without him.  The son cares for his father throughout the night as he slowly passes.  When the father dies this leaves the son all alone to survive in the world.

3578551,5,B001FB5634,"The novel behind the film is absolutely breathtaking. The film tries hard to be as good and it neglects the literary means of the book to concentrate on the visual means of the film. We are just after the end of the world due to some kind of big fire that burnt everything down, covered the whole world with a shroud of ashes, killed all natural life whatsoever or nearly and locked up the whole earth in an immense cloud of ashes that caused at once the cooling down of the temperature and then the cold. We are not even given any explanation. We are shown the results and they talk all by themselves. The situation is simple as for the few survivors. The main two characters are a father and a son. A flashback later on will speak of the delivery of the child, quite a few years before, and the mother's going out to die in the dark after the catastrophe as she was for some vague reason dying. That's not the most important element. What we are studying is the behavior of the father and the son as long as they are together, that is to say all along, and how this privileged relationship makes them different from the other survivors. Some get together in bands or gangs and they raid the world to get what they can and survive collectively no matter how, that is to say even with hunting other survivors and cannibalism. Then you have those who are more solitary, alone or in couples. We have a few examples of solitary ones who become scavengers, but of the living, hence thieves, looters, killers in a way or another. The contact with these solitary people pushes the father towards some defensive and even over-defensive attitudes. The son intervenes then to counterbalance this over-use of protectiveness and to maybe remind the father of the human duty of sharing. A difficult task. But the film wants to take that boy to the end of the road, to the death of the father, to his mourning and sadness, and at the same time the desire to survive, like the father had said, and that desire will turn the father into a recollection, a memory and let the son accept to be integrated in another wider family structure, still on the road. The visual character of this film seems to tell us even in the direst straits of a final catastrophe, there remains some hope in the mind of human beings and they can first imagine their survival and hence try to survive and second keep some humane principles that are of course the promise of a humane society later on. That's the question that should be asked: is the survival instinct collective or individual, is the survival instinct capable to follow some ethical line? The answer is not easy since the film, like the book, do not go beyond the mourning the boy is confronted to at the end of his road and at the beginning of a second road. This road will maybe never end but all along the way some spirituality will try to survive. That's a very optimistic film, at this ethical level, though I seem to remember the book was optimistic too but at the level of the ingenuity and the inventiveness of human beings in some situations when survival becomes an obligation. At the end of this film there is little knowledge about the future but yet a gleam of hope.

It does follow the book very closely and most scenes are exactly as I had envisioned them. It is a very dark, lonely, depressing story, BUT -- with a strong underlying element of hope and love. Specifically, that which makes us human, why we press onward when all seems lost. For what? In this case, a fathers love for his son. The mood expressed is not an especially popular one for a major motion picture and as such, is one of the reasons I bought it on Blu-ray, not because it is something I want to watch repeatedly, but because I have a LOT of respect for and want to support filmmakers that are willing to go against the trend of only producing light, pop-culture, feel-good, easily digestible ""product"".",1279152000,71,806,4.527397260273973
3578554,2,B001FB5634,"In my best estimation, I have to assume the attempt with this movie was to spark deep thought with a bit of an artistic twist. All of the content that would achieve such a notion was no doubt left on the cutting room floor. I can appreciate that notion if it is achieved. It just wasn't.

If you dig a bit, you will see a struggle for a father to show love and give protection to his son no matter what the cost. Unfortunately, it was wrapped up in a huge package of BORING.

This in a post-apocalyptic movie which we have seen several come out recently, and you come to expect a cretin bit of adventure mixed with some action and perhaps a little thought provoking content as well. This movie was dark and had little beyond that, listening to a little boy wine and cry as they walked and walked from one boring situation to another. While we are at it, the son did wine and cry way, WAY too much. He was raised after the virtual destruction of the earth (we were never really told what happened which bugged me) and, being raised in such a time, he would have been tough and accustomed to the world being what it was, all he ever had known. Instead, he constantly wines and cries. Did I mention he wines and cries a lot?

I do indeed see some high marks from other viewers. So, perhaps my perspective is just that. I am, however, thankful for Redbox, because if I had spent more than a dollar, I would have been even more disappointed.

If you are looking for a good movie with the same premise, I would highly recommend The book of Eli. It had everything I would look for in a movie like this.",1279152000,2,1595,4.219672131147541
3578555,4,B001FB5634,"Well, after watching two equally great movies about a post-apocalyptic world one thing is for sure: life on Earth will suck after the apocalypse. Whether we ultimately nuke ourselves to oblivion or some stray asteroid does the job instead, both of the writers for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-of-Eli/dp/B002ZG997M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book of Eli</a>&nbsp;and The Road see a dystopian world full of cannibals and little hope. I hope that we never truly experience it, but, man, these two movies were cool!

Of the two movies I think that I liked Eli a little bit more, which is reflective of my affinity for violent, graphic novel-esque movies. And indeed, The Book of Eli seemed to be exactly that...a graphic novel come to life about a rogue nomad determined to transport a special book west across a bleak and dangerous landscape. But Eli (Denzil Washington) is prepared to make the transfer...well prepared. Yes, there is unrest in the forest and Eli will keep it all equal with hatchet, ax and saw. And are higher forces at work helping to guide Eli along?

Then there's The Road. This time the traveler is a man (Viggo Mortensen) also heading off in search of a safe haven. This man believes that the safe haven is south, and like Eli, he also has some cargo with him that he intends to protect and deliver safely at all costs...that cargo being his son. The land that Mortensen & son attempt to cross is in the same condition and full of the same dangers that I mentioned that Eli was dealing with. The Road is a lot lighter on the violence than Eli and more about a father trying to lead his son down a path of righteousness, while at the same time maintaining self-preservation as numero uno.

I'd almost suggest that the two stories could be tied together and happening simultaneously in a United States devastated by catastrophe. Although, in Eli the apocalypse is explained as the result of nuclear war and bright sunlight burning the planet up due to resulting damage to the ozone layer; and I don't recall an explanation in The Road, but I think that we're supposed to gather that it was from a giant asteroid or something that created a world where a dust cloud permanently obscures the sun. Either way it's a living doomsday.

Both movies feature a host of A-list actors, and even the actors that aren't as well known give A-list performances. Action. Thrills. Emotion. Get it all in two parallel worlds where you will kill or be killed for something that today you'd have discarded as trash. The Book of Eli and The Road as a double-feature for your weekend?

3578557,3,B001FB5634,"After I first read Cormac McCarthy's novel on which this film is based I concluded that it was a good read, worthy of all the hype. I then had occasion to read it again a couple of years later and remember wondering as I revisited it what exactly it had been that I liked about the book. It's so bleak, so dark. I wondered until I got to the end. The conclusion makes it all worth while. It's the same with the movie. Of course, I'm not going to tell you how it ends, although I was still overwhelmed by the conclusion after knowing quite well what would happen.

It's the story of a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his young son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who struggle to survive in a (as that strange phrase goes) ""post-apocalyptic world."" There have been several Hollywood productions on this theme. It seems the end of the world tends to bring out the worst in folks. Their animal natures prevail. They just aren't nice.

The film does not approach the artistry of the book. However, the cinematography is strong, capturing a grey, ash-filled world littered with the rusting and rotting remains of civilization. But there was something forced about the acting. Smit-McPhee's performance was astonishingly dull until he came through in the last segment. I think Mortensen went too far trying to be an Everyman who was overwhelmed by it all. It seemed to me that he was overwhelmed by his role. I think more interaction with the scattered survivors that the pair encountered would have helped. Maybe a little suspense. A dash of humor. That sort of thing.",1278806400,,1543,4.648351648351649

The movie is depressing and haunting because it is so realistic and it represents a possible future reality.

From what I have heard from people not liking it, the reasons they don't like it are because it doesn't explain the cause of the new, wasteland conditions of the planet, and because it's so real.

The only color you will see in this bleak tale is the bloody chopping blocks of what is presumably a cannibal's kitchen.

Being a huge fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, I'm decided to take a look into what this movie had to offer when visiting my local movie rental shop. Probably the best money I've spent to rent a movie in quite some time. This movie takes a realistic look into a ruined world. For those who tend to look for expensive CG effects and car chases, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

As far as a film adaptation of a powerful book, it is equaled only by John Boorman's 1972 classic ""Deliverance"". When my wife and I finished watching this wrenching movie we tearfully called up our 26 year old daughter, who lives on her own , and asked her over to our house so that we could put our arms around her, kiss her, and tell her that we love her. Why this film was not nominated for an Academy Award as ""Best Picture"" is a total mystery to me.",1278288000,,597,4.292035398230088
3578612,3,B001FB5634,"Other reviewers have covered the theme of this movie, so I won't go over it again. I normally don't have any trouble watching a whole movie, unless it's some grade-Z snorefest. I don't turn stuff off if it's too gory, or not family-friendly, or anything like that.

But I got 40 minutes into The Road and I simply could not go any further. There were good points: in a landscape where every single thing was more or less the same color, somehow the cinematography was incredible. Charlize Theron was great in her flashback appearances.

And Viggo Mortenson--well, I think he was the problem. I kept asking myself, who would want to live in a world like this? But Viggo's character definitely did want to live, or at least survive. Even in the non-dialogue scenes, it was written all over him. Even when he was giving matter-of-fact suicide instructions to his son, I could still see how much he wanted himself and his son to live.

That's why, after a particularly grim scene, I had to turn it off. It wasn't the horror of the grim stuff that made me reach for the off button--it was The Man's fierce and terrible love for his son, brought to life by Viggo Mortenson's acting. It was too heartbreaking. I looked at some spoiler reviews after that and saw that things didn't get much better. So I didn't start it up again.

I think The Road might have been better if I'd read the book first. So I think I'll do that, and maybe--maybe--I'll try the movie again.",1278288000,2,1459,4.515151515151516

3578614,5,B001FB5634,"First let me say this movie is brilliant.  Fierce, moving, terrifying, and unforgettable.  The story of a father and 12 yr old son trying to survive a post-apocalyptic world is one of the most realistic and stunning stories I have seen of this kind.  ""The Book of Eli"" came out around the same time, and while I enjoyed that movie enormously, it was much more of a ""Road Warrior"" type story with lots of slam-bang action and really only touched on the darkness this tory fleshes out in detail.  ""The Road"" never cheats or makes things easy conveying a world which has been thrown back into an age where they have to worry about being murdered, raped, and cannibalized.  Viggo Mortensen is brilliant here, reminding us why he is one of the best actors of our time.  Kodi Smit-McPhee gives one of the best performances by a child actor in recent memory as Mortensen's son.  He is vulnerable, loving, and devoted to his father and McPhee conveys all too realistically a child who has grown up in hell's last circle.  Look at the scene where he thinks he sees another child, and he breaks down in an aching scene of just wanting another child to share the world with, play with, and feel like he's not the last of his kind.  Stunning.

Blu-ray is the only format to let this movie shine.  The pallette is bleak, grey, and desolate, and the flashbacks to the world before (we are never really told what happened, but left to infer) pop off the screen with bright greens, ambers, and warm colors.  The 1080p image is razor sharp with nary a flaw.  Blacks are inky and deep, but never crushed.  Fine detail is so strong, at times the picture looks almost 3 dimensional.  The soundtrack is both pulverzing and subtle.  Action scenes are pounding with deep bass and the ambient surrounds, wind, etc. are immersive and realistic.  The sound is a DTS HD MA mix.  This is the only way to see this film.  Highly recommended.",1278115200,2,1911,4.535087719298246

It's a great film, but you must be in the right mind to fully enjoy it.",1277942400,,458,4.112359550561798

As stated in the other reviews, the setting is bleak.  Bleaker yet more realistic than anything I think I've ever seen before.  In spite of that, or maybe because of it, the movie does a great job of extending the attachment between the man and the boy to the viewer.  So good in fact that I found it difficult to continue watching considering the high potential for a very bleak outcome.  You feel pretty sure that it isn't going to end at some nice safe haven like I am Legend or Children of Men.  On the other side of the equation, the movie would be completely unbearable to watch if it ended like The Myst.  Not knowing the ending creates a huge sense of tension which is almost unbearable.  I really thought that was where the magic was for this movie.

This movie is definitely not for everyone and the bad reviews here are understandable.  The movie drags you and your emotions under into a world of crushing despair and darkness.

3578617,5,B001FB5634,"Many reviews below have complained about the unreality of the high level of cannibalism this film depicts. The story takes place a little more than ten years after an unnamed world apocalypse. ALL vegetation is dead; there are no crops, and none can be grown. All animals are dead. There is no electricity. Got it? Every item in every grocery store would have been depleted within a year after the apocalypse. Items requiring refrigeration would have spoiled within a week. THERE IS NO FOOD LEFT....except for the only surviving animal.....man. In such a situation, your choice would be to either die of starvation, or eat the only thing left to eat. End of cannibalism discussion. As stated numerous times, this film does depict the bleakest, most despair-filled scenario I've seen. It is VERY distressing, but it is also extremely thought-provoking. I don't think anyone could watch this film without thinking of themselves and their families in a similar situation. On the surface, the hopelessness for existing is engulfing. Yet, we are shown one man's determination to protect his young son from the bleakest of circumstances, and the consuming love of parent for child. THAT is the story as it takes place on ""the road"" south. One reviewer balked at the idiocy of father and child leaving the only hidden food source they find. That reviewer must have forgotten the importance of the trip down ""the road"" to the south. Without electricity, they could not survive another winter where they were. So, taking as much food as they can, they continue on. All along their trip, they encounter the horrors of starving people searching for ANYTHING (them) to eat. There are several situations that made me recoil in abject sadness, and unnerving understanding. Yet, throughout, the father's love and protectiveness is top priority. The acting of father and son, Viggo Mortenson and Kodi Smit-McPhee is absolute perfection! I was moved to tears more than once by the son's performance! Considering the darkness of the story, the ending gave a much-needed lift that despite the animal humans can become under such situations, there will still be goodness and hope for a better tomorrow. This film is definitely not everyone's cup of tea - not everyone LIKES tea!

3578665,3,B001FB5634,"I've never read the book, and honestly don't care to. I do however watch movies... and that's what this review is going to be about.

First off ""The Road"" had all the right elements but they somehow had all the wrong ones too.

 The movie is mainly about a man and his son who are traveling on their last hope. The man knows that where ever he goes there will be nothing, and  I'm quite sure the boy does too. However, they decide to believe in the lie that there is hope beyond the horizon.

Watching the movie you realize that they travel this ""road"" because it's what keeps them alive. The ""hope"" or as they call it in the film the ""fire"" that they carry will lead them on. The film has this surreal Planet Of The Apes vibe going on. Something devastating has happened to the planet and yet it remains a complete mystery as to what or how.

Most of the movie revolves around the relationship of the Father and his daughter... umm er I mean Son. The Father character is a bit naive or should I say he is cautiously naive. He takes all the precautions to avoid potential danger yet he still ends up heading right into it. It also doesn't help that his goal is to get his Son (might as well had been his daughter) to become more independent so that he could continue to survive in his absence.

The biggest problem with this idea is that the Son who is about 11 acts more like a 4 year old girl. Whining,crying,hanging on to his father, throwing tantrums, etc.etc. This kid wouldn't make it 2minutes without being eaten if his father wasn't around. The role of the boy would of made more sense if he was a girl the way the Father treated him. The actor they got for the role was extremely annoying! If he wasn't whining he was crying and if he wasn't crying he was whining. If the kid was 3 or 4 understandable... but the kid was about 11-12.

Another thing about the movie is that absolutely no one seems to have any will to survive. They are all just waiting to die and buying their time. (possible spoiler) Like when the Fathers wife just decides she would rather die than live because it's too stressful for her...so she just walks outside to die. What was that about? Why didn't the father just literally slap some sense into her. Throughout the entire movie it's just talking about suicide and walking from point A to point B.

The story has some action sequences and interesting moments... but it has no climax. It just them walking around and running into dangerous situations occasionally. The more interesting parts of the movie are watching the cannibals and all their scenes. Makes you think how awesome the movie could have been if it was about them instead.

Overall this movie is okay if you can put up with a whiny boy girl.",1277078400,5,2740,4.375984251968504

Personally, I was disappointed and do not believe that this film will have a lasting, long term power over audience in spite of Viggo Mortenson's touching performance as a father doing everything possible to protect his son in post apocaliptic world that has lost all traces of its humanity.

Like ""Mad Max"" and similar movies, after world goes into smitterines and there is no food, water, animals or plant life left, humanity goes out of the door as well.  People are at their worst behavior and need for survival takes them to make drastic measures.  Main characters are father and son searching to find a way to a better world.  While Mortenson convincigly portays father who protects his only son and reflects on the better times from his past, young actor playing his son seems too pretentious when he refers to his father as ""Papa"" thoughout the movie.

I have not read the book, but I do have a feeling that certain messages about human connection, our inner feelings and need to connect are just not translated well into this movie.",1276819200,2,1212,4.635514018691588
3578701,3,B001FB5634,"This is not primarily an apocalyptic movie.  The cataclysm that overtakes the earth is never shown, never talked about, and never defined.  It's killed practically everything, including plants, although counterintuitively some humans survived.  The disaster itself is unimportant; the point is that it strips all the non-essentials from the relationship between humans, and in particular this father and son.

This movie shows the love, trust, sense of honor, and even faith between the two protagonists in a world shorn of all such redundancies.  Ten years after the beginning of the end of the world father and son set out for southern climes and, they hope, some kind of respite from the agony of living at the world's finale.  They scrounge for food while half-starved, sleep in old vehicles, and try to avoid the ghastly cannibals and their horror.  The movie is profoundly disturbing at times even though the horror is implied and not shown for the most part.

And yet this bareness, this looking at father and son with all of civilization stripped away on a dying planet, allows us to more clearly see what really matters with family.  Even the mother eventually marched away from her husband and child to die in the wilderness.  But the father carries on, hopeful, and despite a near-lapse or two into the barbarism surrounding him and his son (with the son playing a part in calling him back), still loves his son and instills in him the belief that there are still good guys and bad guys.  And they are the good guys.  At heart, this movie seems to be about what a father would do for his child in the most extreme of circumstances.

It took a while to adjust to the notion that questions and details about what happened and what was going on in the world weren't going to be answered in the movie.  They're extraneous to its point.  But it was still a hard adjustment for me to make.  It was hard to believe, even knowing that the father thought they were under threat, that he would leave a huge survivalist underground cache of food behind.  If he'd had a little more faith, as his son implied when he questioned whether the others they'd heard (actually their barking dog) above ground might actually be more good guys and not bad, they would have been far better off.

It was a risk the father wouldn't take, for the sake of his son.  The movie also avoided the trap of the duo packing all sorts of weapons and spraying lead at cannibals at every turn.  They have one revolver with two cartridges, period.  Realistically as well, the father doesn't engage in heroisms or derring-do when others are taken by the cannibals, for he knows there's nothing he can do.  And he must protect his son.

This show isn't light viewing; it gives ""bleak"" a new definition.  But it also boils down to the bare nubbin the relationship between father and son.  If you can stomach it, this movie is an interesting, almost moving look at one such parental tie.",1276819200,15,2956,4.66023166023166

This, unfortunately, was on the bad side. Its story was so thin and dry that it slowly dragged on and on with no real direction. It seemed like everyone on the production team was trying desperately to figure out new and different ways to fill in the space allotted for a movie of this scope.

3578706,5,B001FB5634,"Hollywood films are usually so sugar-coated. Everything has a resolution and/or a happy ending.
Well, life isn't like that, so sometimes a dark film is actually a good thing.
I don't want to spoil anything, but it's refreshing to see a film start carries the dark and depressing theme throughout the ENTIRE duration.

When I was studying cinema in college, I had visions of grandeur of becoming an awesome director by making against-the-grain films, against the Hollywood norms where there isn't a resolution or happy ending, that audiences would enjoy.
While the first part is still on backorder, at least I know the second part can be true, as I really did enjoy this movie.
There are a few flashbacks that break the monotonous setting, but from beginning to end, it's a visual tour de force of bleakness.
This would be a perfect movie to see after being dumped or fired. It's like Washington state on a really bad hair-day.

I'm no professional acting judge so I'm not going to make some pompous critique of the performances, but I LOVE Charlize Theron, and it's another fine role that stretches her acting range. She doesn't play a ""good"" or ""bad"" person in this movie, and her character has a very human flaw, and in the end she takes the ""easy"" way out.

Ask yourself, what would you do if you were the last few survivors of a dying world or one on reset? What is there left to live for? In movies like I Am Legend, The Day the Earth Stood Still, etc., the filmmakers dance around that question by not creating such a bleak (and real) outcome, and taking the easy way out themselves.
But this is the first movie I've watched that tackles that question head-on and makes you conscious of it immediately.
It's one of those rare settings where the outcome has already been decided in the beginning, and you're along for the ride to just find out how long it will last.

It also asks the question, are humans essentially Good or Bad beings?
An English teacher of mine in high school once asked this question, and I, not knowing back then, ultimately decided that we are Good.
But humans are essentially animals, and as animals our #1 instinct is survival. When you break us down to our core, we will do whatever it takes to survive.
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
Whether that means to kill to give yourself power and control over people, to kill one another as food, or to kill to keep your son alive for the future, it still all boils down to survival, whatever the rhyme or reason.

There is no right or wrong answer. We are human. We are survivors.

Yes, the terrain the father and son journey through is almost all ashen gray. (Some of this movie was filmed on the remaining wasteland locations of real disasters such as Katrina and the eruption of Mt. St. Helens.) Yes, some of the roving bands of people they encounter on the road are using shocking methods of surviving. Some have fallen to subhuman levels of ruthlessness. But there is redemption along the way too, just as there's an unexpected rainbow that appears over a waterfall. And overall, it's a rare glimpse of a father-son as the crucial nurturing pair, rather than the more usually depicted mother-child.

The kind of apocalypse that might have brought about this post-apocalyptic world is left to your imagination. I'd recently been reading what it must have been like for the dinosaurs after the giant meteor hit in the Yucatan, igniting firestorms and sending clouds of ash into the sky that blocked out the sun around the globe for dinosaur generations. Maybe a meteor could account for this work's apocalypse. But you are free to look for clues and to imagine what disaster, natural or man-made, brought about the desolation of ""The Road.""

Director Hillcoat gives a fairly good, if low-key, commentary on this disc. In addition to telling about the rigorous conditions the actors faced at some of the shoot locations, he tells about his initial attempts to shield the young actor Kodi Smit-McPhee from some of the harsher evocations of death and despair in this film. But in the end he said that the boy was already wise beyond his years (as shown in his brilliant acting job) - and had already known about or intuited the existence of cruelty and death. The Director also compares what he eventually was able to get on-screen with the Cormac McCarthy book on which the film is based.

There are some lapses of logic here, such as why the characters feel compelled to slog onwards with their meager cart full of goods in the first place, rather than staying put somewhere. Some explanation for that is given in one of the deleted scenes. But of course without their road trip, there wouldn't be a movie. And it doesn't really matter anyway.

The film girds the viewer with a determination to survive with some grace and humanity no matter what befalls. It will also probably inspire most of us to cherish and protect more of what we have now - what the characters in this film only have in brief flashback dreams of more golden times.",1276300800,5,2685,4.740899357601713

3578761,1,B001FB5634,"Ten minutes into this film I knew the end.

Fifteen minutes into the film I found myself looking forward to the stupid father getting wasted along with his silly son.

I'm surprised I managed to watch the whole miserable, pathetic 1 hour and 53 minutes.

The last three minutes was the only entertaining part of this movie although it seemed contrived and unnatural.

Plot: The plot seems to be to explore how this post-apocalyptic influenced the psychology/emotions of the father and son and their relationship. The father, who I hated from the very beginning, smothers his son, treating him like a 3-year-old when he is obviously about 10 years old. The son responds by acting like a 3-year-old most of the time (surprise, surprise) by wining, crying and being afraid and helpless. The only thing this pathetic father is good at is scaring the Frackin' shiebe out of his son by instructing him repeatedly how to blow off his head with the .38 revolver and does actually hold the gun to his sons head for about 30 seconds when some scary people are around.

This father is so inadequate as a post-apocalyptic father that he evidently has not thought of teaching his son how to hunt or trap or fish which fathers 5000 years ago were doing which is something probably any of us father's could figure out having or having not attended the boy-scouts.

Sharpening a straight tree limb for a spear would be a good beginning, duh. Or how about rigging a sling, setting a wire trap, or dropping-crushing trap, or how to make a fish hook out of a twig, or at least a bow and arrow with a tri-tip arrow tip for sticking trout or steel-head or salmon. A lot of the area the picture was taken in was around Mt. St. Helen's, which is crisscrossed with streams, lakes, and reservoirs with native fish in them. With all those cars laying around and with the number of small towns passed through, one would think that might set off a light in the fathers head to use some of the obvious materials at hand . . . like a shattered piece of headlight lens as use for a cutting device for his son. Any of those trucks found in the roads would have some tools left in them that could be very useful for constructing basic survival supplies and survival implements. Grab some of that gut that is laying around with dead people, dry it out and ya have your gut string to string the bow. The one time he does something good like killing a guy with his signal gun, he doesn't steal the guys hunting bow/arrows even though the guy just shot him in the leg . . . o!0.

This father's character didn't evolve on iota as far as I could tell. And like I said I couldn't wait for him to snuff-it. I had too, too long to wait.

The kid for his part, seems emotionally and intellectually stunned to an astounding degree and like I said, looking about ten years old and acting like he's about 3 with his most intelligent comments being ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm scared,"" or ""I want to die."" Additionally, the child delivers his lines is a stilted unconvincing manner, that leaves me with the feeling they are contrived and stilted.

Since there is a flashback to the birth of this guy's son, we know they have been post-apocalyptic for many years at least as long as the kid is old. The wife showed the same two bullets that we saw as viewers at the beginning of the film. So they haven't been killing stuff with that gun. And the kid is about ten years old? Just how has this father who is singularly unqualified to keep himself alive for 5 minutes in a post-apocalyptic world managed to keep himself and his son alive for ten years? This makes the story exceedingly unconvincing . . . so much so that my ability to withhold disbelief fails repeatedly (my ability to withhold disbelief is extremely good by the way) and I found myself wondering every few moments how the hell these two could possibly be alive considering they are singularly incompetent in survival skills.

Given that this guy's idea for the best way to survive is to spend about as much time as possible out in open terrain, on roads along the most highly traveled portions of this soon to be dead world, lighting raging fires during the night to signal their whereabouts to every predator (person and animals alike) in the area. This guy should have died 5 minutes after the beginning of the apocalyptic.

The boy did finally wake up at almost the end of the film and stood up to his pathetic father. Unfortunate, it was too little too late. If this had happened much, much earlier in the film there may have been the possibility of the son (an idiot savant with a genius for survival skills) teaching the father how to survive . . . kind of a reverse fathering from son to father. That could have been pretty cool! Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

Even the repeated flashbacks to the father with the mother pre-apocalypse only increased the films confusion, lack of direction, and incontinence. One of the major scenes between them was when her water broke before delivery of the kid and she said, ""I don't want to go through this."" That is supposed to be news? Who cares! Just shut up and have your baby you coward. Like help re-populate the world bitch! This is about the survival of humans as a species ya know. Gees.

Happily, for some reason only God knows, she decided to walk out the door in the middle of the night into the dark and bleak forest just having taken off all her heavy jacket and sweaters. Her reason for doing this was something like ""I don't want to live in a world like this."" Boy, better off without her. Kick her in the ass to help her on her way out into the wilds of the night.

There is a feeble attempt to try and question the morality of the post-apocalyptic world, when the son insists on giving some food to a couple guys they meet on the road. There is no question about attempting to bring these guys into the social circle of the father and son, oh no. It seems the only people in this soon to be dead planet that continue the tradition of humans gathering in social groups are the bands of cannibals roaming the area tracking, then killing lonely humans. The only other people I haven't mention that cross the path of the father and son before the end of the film, are a woman and her daughter who are run down by a gang of cannibals, chopped up, and I assumed promptly dropped into the cooking pot.

But this is a post-apocalyptic film and all could have been forgiven if there was one bit of this film that was entertaining. But for the cinematography, there would not have been one thing I found entertaining about this film. The dialogue was pointless, and worse for most of the movie the dialogue was whispered at such a low tone I could not make it out having watched it on amazon.com Video-on demand (no CC text). No humor, no introduction of interesting characters (even Duvall was a let down . . . he must be getting desperate for parts to be taking trash like that), little violence, no zombies, no sweet looking babes, virtually no character development in the father or son which would have been great as they are both so pathetic at the beginning of the film. Not even a cute little pet to watch bounce around until it too ended up in the cooking pot.

The only thing I remained curious about throughout the film was just how bad the film would get, and just how the director would accomplish it.",1276214400,13,7380,4.455555555555556

The story moves at such a slow, boring rate with long pauses and pointless stops in the narrative that you want to hit the fast forward button. This movie is not entertainment unless you like relentless bleakness and/or cannibals. There is no point to the story. The author in the book and the movie makers never tell you what happened to the world so it can't be a warning to mankind to take care of the Earth or for mankind to beware of natural disasters. So after squinting at the muddy film and straining to hear each word and enduring countless ""Papa""s you are left with nothing. Is it a film about the love of a father for a son? Hardly a revelation if so. Some people would call this art since you can make your own judgment what this thing is about. I just call it a waste of time and money as it screams ""I am making this film vague, figure it out your own damn self"".

3578764,5,B001FB5634,"This is really a bit of a gut wrenching movie.  I am somewhat surprised that it is coupled with Wolfman, although the original intent of Wolfman was good versus evil, this movie is much more apocalyptic and unnerving in many ways.

Set at a time in the future, you get a sense that something has happened immediately.  The movie is filmed mostly in and around Mount Saint Helens, in the initial scenes.  So, you will get the gist of what everything looks like.  I guess the author was attempting to show the results to the earth of a nuclear winter or nuclear fall, yet it is really what the remaining people do that is the key message here.

If you view the extras in the DVD first, I suggest you get to know the story a little. The author is an older man with a young son, he wrote the book for a reason for his love of country, yet, there is something he needs to get across to us.

The good versus evil is really telling.  What would you do if there was a lack of basics.  I have not seen a movie so stark in its depiction of possible future in a long time.  You are made to feel always on edge.  You think about the trouble these two are in, father and son, trying to get somewhere hoping for some type of future.

Viggo Mortensen does a great job, his intensity is just amazing. Look for Robert Duvall, you may miss him if you are not careful.

Finally, in the book of Ezekiel in the bible there is a scripture that tells about what things were like in a time of trouble.  People in the day hoped for the night and in the night they hoped for the day, why?, because things were just that frightening, you get that sense with The Road.

3578766,5,B001FB5634,"Civilisation has been destroyed, the human race reduced to a few survivors struggling to eke out a living amidst the ruins of what once was. A man and his son make their way south to the coast, hoping to find warmer weather and more plentiful supplies of food, before the world dies.

Based on the Pulitzer-winning 2006 novel by Cormac McCarthy, The Road is a post-apocalyptic movie starring Viggo Mortensen as the father and Kodi Smith-McPhee as his son. A number of other established actors have extended cameos, with Charlize Theron playing Mortensen's wife in flashback, Robert Duvall as an old man met on the road and The Wire's Michael K. Williams as a thief, whilst Guy Pearce also appears briefly. However, the film focuses on Mortensen and Smith-McPhee almost exclusively for long stretches of its running time.

The book is notable for its pared-back, stark prose style, which is unflinching in its depiction of the brutalised, battered world and the often savage people that are encountered along the way. The film is similarly cold and stripped-back, with a heavily desaturated colour palette and a certain remoteness to the directing style which only lightens in some of the more emotional scenes between the father and his son. It's a film in which morality without the context of civilisation is questioned, with the son constantly asking, ""Are we the good guys?"" and the survivors finding their faith (either in God or in human nature), constantly challenged by circumstances. That it addresses this issues with a scarcity of dialogue for a modern film is all the more impressive, and is reflective of the book.

There have been some changes to accommodate the medium of film. There are a few more incidents along the road, maybe a few more characters who appear and interact with our protagonists (though still a bare handful), and there's a couple of moments where cliche rears its ugly head (notably the boy's complete inability to shut up when possible hostile people are around, which I don't recall being so pronounced in the book), though these are mercifully brief. For a post-apocalyptic movie, there's also a near-total lack of modern special effects, with only one incongruous CGI establishing shot in the whole film (although no doubt much more subtle CGI manipulation of images occurs throughout). This adds to the sense of realism. The film is also well-paced and fairly short for a modern picture at about 100 minutes in length. On the minus side, Charlize Theron's character has more screentime than in the book, which you'd expect to mean her character receives more development, but this isn't really the case, and an early scene involving a truck full of nefarious folk up to no good briefly makes you think you're watching Mad Max (for all of about five seconds though, so not a huge issue), which isn't really the tone the creators were going for.

The Road (****) is fascinating, well-acted, impressively-directed and unflinching, whilst occasionally sounding a note of hope. The film is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1276128000,,3088,4.978682170542636

This is a fantastic movie. I can't for the life of me understand why some people would give this 1 star. I would ignore those reviews. If you go into this movie expecting a rock em sock em action movie you will be disappointed. If you go in looking for a cheery movie that will leave you feeling good, you will be disappointed. The fact is this is a depressing, and at times, very hard movie to watch. It is a portrayal of what someone would face if the world we live in died.

I kept waiting for the story to get started. I generally like apocalyptic fiction, and do not require a happy ending, but this was just too bleak for my tastes.  The surviving populace seemed to be divided into three one dimensional categories - hopeless, helpless, and predatory.  While many stories in this genre tend to gloss over the decline of human beings into cannibalism by inserting a mind altering disease of some type (kudos for not using that cliche), this film expects us to accept that a significant portion of the population would devolve to cannibalism within a few years of (admittedly) drastic hunger. I just don't see it. While there are isolated cases of people preying on people as food in desperate conditions, the thought that it would be as widespread and as cold blooded as depicted in this film is hard to accept. I believe a more realistic portrait of humanity in these circumstances is packs of traveling protagonists assailed by loan wolf cannibals, rather than the reverse portrayed here. I guess I like my apocalyptic fiction to highlight the positives of humanity, rather than suggesting that those positives are freakish aberrations in a child.",1276041600,17,1330,4.902222222222222

The director deserves kudos, as do the actors, but i found myself wanting to see more of Robert Duvall. Viggo Mortenson is more than believable as a father whose optimism fades with each grey day becoming darker. Protecting his child at all costs and moving towards hope is the primary theme and the landscape designers did an awesome job. Very believable...solar flare, volcanic eruptions, nuclear holocaust...the origin of the earth's wasteland is a mystery, but there are so many theories out there whose visual projections are in sync with popular theory. This movie is a great deal more realistic than the Mad Max series. Interesting comparisons... roving gangs, violence, absence of most species and chronic adrenaline rushes.

The title says it all....the landscape is melancholy, the currency is food, and the motivation is traveling, moving onward. Other assets are transportation, shelter and of course, ammunition. Wonderful cinematography, a general sense of hopelessness with the wee bit of promise in the distance, just out of reach...but there nonetheless. Thumbs UP!",1275955200,3,1362,5.300925925925926

2009's The Road is based on the 2006 post-apocalyptic novel of the same name, written by Cormac McCarthy. Fans of the book needn't fear that the film version has ruined the story, as it follows it fairly faithfully.
 The world of The Road takes place in a near future where some mysterious, disastrous occurrence has rendered the earth all but uninhabitable. Within the first few minutes of the movie, we learn that there was a night of bright light and loud concussions. After that, nothing was the same - much of the world's population was dead, along with crops, animals, and life in general. It is never explained exactly what happened, as the actual crisis is not as important as the story of survival in the aftermath.
 Viggo Mortensen plays the lead character of The Father, while 11-year-old Kodi Smit-McPhee plays the role of The Son. Charlize Theron is in the film briefly, and only in a series of flashbacks as The Mother. Robert Duvall also makes an appearance as the Old Man. It is strange and unusual that the characters do not have actual names; however, this is how it was portrayed in the book as well.
 In a time where corporations no longer exist and transportation is defunct, it is very hard for the remaining people to find food. No new cans are being rolled off the production lines, there are no mega farms subsidized by the federal government to feed the nation. Horrifyingly, many have resorted to cannibalism, and roving gangs patrol regions looking for food, whether this is fellow humans or leftover nonperishable goods.
 The film uses voice-over narration and flashbacks to get inside The Father's head. It offers glimpses of what life was like before the disaster happened. The Son does not know a time when life was peaceful and food was plentiful - he was born into a time of horror, strife, and starvation. The Son also has had little interaction with other children - not only are there no schools functioning, but there are few children who survived or have been born since. The Son is innocent and nave, due to having been sheltered by his parents in his early years. Later in the film, he matures beyond his years due to what he is exposed to and the gritty realities of life in these times.
 The trailers for this film incorrectly portrayed it as an action movie. It most certainly is not. It is a drama, a road film, and an exploration of human character. It explores fatherhood in a nurturing, loving way (as opposed to the usual movie depiction of mothers being the involved parent). The real subject matter of The Road is not what happened, but what happened after, and how this new and horrible world affects The Man and his son.
The Father is focused on surviving and protecting his son, while The Son wishes to actually enjoy more of his life. The interactions between the two main characters are visceral and very realistic. Smit-McPee does well at playing a character a few years younger than his actual age. The acting chemistry between the two is palpable.
It is already known that times of desperation can make humans do things they wouldn't otherwise consider. Would it get as bad (cannibalism) as things are portrayed in this movie? This movie spurs thoughts of moral and ethical quandaries - what would the average person do in these times? Obviously it is wrong to kill another for meat, but would it be wrong to eat a human found by the wayside if you were starving to death? What does it mean to remain civilized in a country where civilization no longer exists? How can one insist upon holding onto their morals when they may die by doing so?
Throughout human history, civilization has only been able to progress once the basic needs of its citizens have been met; it is not implausible to think that if these needs were no longer easy to come by, humanity would revert to a primal, more brutal nature.
Our society takes so much for granted: ample supplies of food, clean water, green signs of life all around us, and that we are relatively safe while at home or travelling. This movie shows what it could mean when access to these things (luxuries in the reformed, bleak world of The Road) are all stripped away. The film is bleak and harrowing, yet at the end there is a glimpse of hope which makes it worthwhile to watch.",1275955200,4,4368,4.622422680412371

This is not one of those movies that you forget about 5 minutes after watching. This is the type of movie that stays with you. I only wish that i could have seen more of Charlize Theron.

3578857,5,B001FB5634,"The Road is a slow-moving, existentialist post-apocalyptic film. If the lack of constant action every few minutes or fancy CG turns you off, this movie is not for you. But, if like me, you love the post-apocalyptic genre and don't mind slow, depressing, suspense films driven by dialog, this movie is worth checking out.

Most of the film is bleak, depressing, and grey. The world has been destroyed, along with all the plants and animals in it. We don't know how or why or when. All that we're told is that ""the clocks stopped at 1:15"" through narration by a man (Viggo Mortensen) as he and his son trudge across a desolated landscape of dead trees, burned out cars, and rubble. An unspecified cataclysmic event has wiped out civilization and the humans that survived roam the land looking for fuel and food, some of whom are cannibalistic armed gangs. Perhaps it was an atomic detonation -- we're told that ""there was a long shear of bright light then a series of low concussions."" But it doesn't matter. The lack of explanation helps adds to the feeling of disorientation, anonymity, isolation, and despair that is the core of this film. None of the characters in this film have a name, except for the old man towards the end (Eli, played by an unrecognizable Robert Duvall).

It is the story of two people getting from unspecified Point A to unspecified Point B. Part of the story is told in flashbacks to the relationship between the man and his wife (Charlize Theron) in the days before and after the cataclysm. Father and son are making their way south on foot, which they believe to be warmer, sustaining themselves on the hope of finding other ""good guys"" like themselves. The winters are getting colder and the ailing father struggles to keep the two alive and doing whatever he can to retain what's left of his humanity. All they have to protect themselves is an old revolver with 2 bullets, one for each of them to take their own lives as a last resort. Along the way, they encounter dangers and ever-looming threats, mostly from thieves and roving gangs of cannibals. Some of these encounters are vividly and disturbingly portrayed. I find myself afraid to watch one particular scene again where victims are kept locked in a cellar, harvested for body parts, with noses and ears shown in a bloody bathroom sink. Most of the violence, however, happens off-screen or is implied with props, screams or sound effects. I find this more effective and creepier than actually seeing the violence directly.

The film is simply wonderful to look at, for all its devastation and bleak environments. The filmmakers couldn't have done a better job picking the locations and dressing the sets. Mortensen turns in a solid performance, and there are two instances of backal nudity. That Viggo sure likes showing off what his mama done give him (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eastern-Promises-Blu-ray/dp/B001EIOOWC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eastern Promises [Blu-ray</a>] for the infamous naked sauna fight).

3578858,4,B001FB5634,"The Road was a great film, though not the most original I've seen. 1981's The Road Warrior (aka Mad Max II) dealt with very
similar issues and I think was a better film, as it had a bit more action and humour, and also dealt with a lot of the issues
in this film but didn't linger on them as long. One of scenes with Max and The Gyrocaptain pretty much summed up what this movie
is all about, when Gyro is saying how good things used to be in the world - that comment had about 5 seconds screentime.
The Road is a beautiful, dark and probably the most depressing film I've ever seen. Viggo Mortensen really is a glutten for punishment,
after wrapping on three Lord of The Rings films which involved a LOT of walking, here we see him make another movie which pretty
much is more walking than anything else. However, I was impressed that John Hillcoat (The Proposition) chose to film this movie in locations
all around the world that had been touched by enviromental disasters rather than cram it full of CGI, the result works and the movie pulls
you into the world like a recurring nightmare. The best thing about this movie is the music by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, it is simply
stunning and without it I doubt the film would have had as much impact - the sense of utter hopelessness at the end of the world breaks your
heart - especially when Viggo's character stands on the freeway and throws his girlfriend's image to the wind because it hurts him too much to have
her in his heart anymore, its truly heartbreaking. This is a wonderful film but do not watch it in periods of despair or with razorblades close at

The film is a two-hour immersion into the dreary landscape rather than the several hours it takes to read the book.

I enjoyed this road trip because I find utterly fascinating the prospect of global catastrophe. The realistic or in some cases utterly fantastical imaginings of what the world would be like after a global pandemic or nuclear war or any major disaster that wipes out civilization is inherently interesting. I remember as a kid loving a cartoon called Thundarr the Barbarian and latter in life appreciated the now classic The Road Warrior and various post-apocalyptic movies.
This movie based on renowned novelist Cormac McCarthy's book aims to be a strictly realistic portrayal of survival of a man and his son after ""the end"" has come. Their story is simple, straightforward and gloomy as can be. A man and his weak little boy walk through an utterly gray, dying world of decay, sparsely populated by bands of cannibals. He had a wife (played Charlize Theron) who we see only in his dreams. She was not a good person, seems to me, but sadly many people aren't very good are they? You wouldn't expect better from them after the collapse of society. There are no animals, very little food. The man wants to reach the coast where he believes they stand a better chance of survival. There is little hope. They ""carry the fire"" within in a world where the lights are just about to go out. What else are you going to do. Die.

Note: Not for adolescent ADD action junkies. I love it when people assume things about what type of movie and story they're going to watch and when it is not the type of movie they anticipated they go ahead and judge it by the standards of the type of movie they wanted it to be. In other words, no, The Road is not an action flick. But I understand people are conditioned to expect this from Hollywood.",1275696000,2,1968,4.4972067039106145
3578862,2,B001FB5634,"The Road is an unrealistic post-apocalyptic genre film that offers no significant story or insight, yet manages to perpetuate the viewer's anticipation by its constant tension. Even though it offers a cutting glimpse into the survivalist chaos of the aftermath through it's poignant imagery, it lacks a definite grace. Ultimately, other than a sensational cameo by Robert Duvall, it fails to capture the viewer's heart (or head).

--> WARNING: Brief synopsis and spoiler alert

A father struggles to survive for himself and his son after his wife passes away, and they decide to migrate southward. However, the film offers no apparent reason why either of them set out on a venture across the devastated landscape besides the obvious search for food and shelter (which they already had plenty of before they left). Despite the obvious dangers of this quest -- cannibals, starvation, disease -- they head out on their own worthy pursuit.

One might surmise that the pair should seek out refuge amongst whichever spared tribes are left, yet the characters seem more interested in toughing it out on their own, giving the viewer a feeling of utter isolation. Indeed, even though they call themselves, ""The Good Guys"", rarely do they do anything genuinely good. They discover several vagabonds along their journey, but instead of taking them in they ship them out, and in one case -- rob them.

As the film drags on the two seem to make heady decisions that lead them away from the obvious targets they were seeking in the first place. This creates some consternation within the viewer's mind. For instance, why would they discover a fallout shelter stocked with food and decide to leave it for no other reason than boredom? A more ridiculous example, is when Vigo Mortensen's character decides to jump out into the ocean to swim to a beached freight ship while coping with what seems to be pneumonia, starvation, and exhaustion.

Not only do their goals seem flimsy but so do their methods. Why would you drag a rotten mattress outside to conceal an underground shelter? It seems like most people do not keep mattresses in their backyard -- that tends to stick out. Also, like another viewer said there is utterly no reason to keep food out in the open when you are amongst scavengers. Any sensible person would hide the goods while keeping them within a safe distance.

In summation, I would not recommend this film for any purpose other brief, shallow entertainment. If you are looking for a realistic survival movie or a poignant drama, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a typical Hollywood adolescent genre film, by all means.",1275609600,11,2632,4.916666666666667

3578866,1,B001FB5634,"Was really looking forward to this, as I enjoy post-Apocalyptic movies, but I ended up hating it.

The problem boils down to this:  they haven't got a story.  They haven't got any insights.  All they've got is suspense.

Now, the movie is well-directed and the editing is even more impressive.  But essentially they're cheating.  One example of this is how, when you're on the edge of your seat because you think somebody's going to come up on them, there'll be a clanking, metal sound.  But in fact there is nobody else there:  the clanking sound, we are to learn in a moment, is merely the pre-audio of a flashback scene whose visuals are to follow a split-second later (e.g., a bullet clanking on the table).

The movie's formula got old very fast:  There's a kid in danger!  Oh no!  Are they going to get him?  Praise God, not that time!  Whew!  But -- O Lordie! -- the cannibals would choose just this moment to come back!  Drat the luck!

After the movie did this too many times, I realized why the filmmakers were doing it:  they had nothing else to offer you.  Unwilling to get into what the catastrophe was, we are left with their BIG INSIGHTS:  survival will be difficult if there is a global cataclysm and traditional values (such as not eating one's fellow man) will in many cases be jettisoned.

Er, didn't need to spend two hours with their movie to learn that.  As one critic wrote, ""A situation and a series of incidents don't equal a story, though, which is why the book was so glaringly flawed. Who wants a date with agony?""

If you enjoy post-Apocalyptic scenarios but want a little more substance, try:  ""A Canticle for Leibowitz,"" ""On the Beach,"" ""A Boy and His Dog,"" ""The Stand,"" ""No Blade of Grass,"" ""Earth Abides,"" etc., some of which are movies too.

No explanation for the apocalyptic events is given, nor is one needed.  In fact, it's beside the point.  This isn't a story about a disaster -- it is the story about human behavior after a disaster.  And here's another scoop for ya -- it ain't that much different from what we see today.  An apocalypse will just shear away all comfort and civility and bring out our absolute best and worst qualities to immediate and unforgiving view.

The man tries to teach his son to be cautious, safe, and resilient, and the son tries to teach his dad to be more humane toward his fellow survivors.  Those two methods don't always co-exist well.  The Man presumably knows enough about human nature to know that in desperate times humans can be ruthless, evil, and dangerous.  The boy definitely needs to learn that lesson but he is still young, inexperienced, and idealistic enough to want to reach out and help his fellow survivors.  Both of them are right, and therein lies the conflict.

The idea of a catastrophe of this magnitude happening in real life in the near future is not all that far-fetched, really.  When it happens, we will quickly devolve into a dog-eat-dog world and the fight for survival will be fierce and brutal.  Don't be shocked -- that's an everyday way of life in much of the animal kingdom anyway.  Nature can be cruel.  So when that happens, how will you respond?  Will you turn cannibal to survive?  How far would you go to protect your loved ones?  Would you even have the courage and strength, both physical and emotional, to endure?

There is a lot to be gleaned from a story like this.  It ain't happy family fare, that's for sure.  But it poses some interesting dilemmas and questions about human behavior and what it means to have humanity.  Your mileage may vary.

To those out there who like to watch movies that are little more than unchallenging and explosive eye candy or rollercoaster action, by all means please skip this one.  Frankly, I wouldn't want to waste my time reading your negative reviews that showcase your narrow-minded view or your inability to accept cinema as a thoughtful storytelling device.  But there is an audience for this film.  Hopefully many of you are that audience.

I'll warn you again, though:  this story can get pretty bleak.

The major cast is pretty remarkable.  Viggo Mortensen has shown his talent countless times before, but this performance elevates him to an elite class.  Robert Duvall is unrecognizable and lends weight to his small amount of screen time like no other actor could.  Michael K.  Williams (""Omar"" from HBO's ""The Wire"") does the same.  And young Australian actor named Kodi Smit-McPhee plays The Boy.  It's always a challenge when incorporating young children in key roles -- you don't want the kid to be too ""cute and adorable"", but he must be sufficiently so if you want to gain the audience's empathy for him.  It's a fine line.  Smit-McPhee walks that line without ever crossing it.

Highly recommended movie.  Regular DVD has Director Commentary, a few short deleted scenes, a brief making-of feature with cast and director interviews, and two theatrical trailers that give the impression this film is slightly more of an action flick than it really is.",1275177600,9,3440,4.738617200674536
3578910,5,B001FB5634,"Relentless. That's the best one-word description of ""The Road."" Relentless.

The world has ended. That happens in the first few minutes. Beautiful color, beautiful flowers, life as it is, life-to-be (Viggo Mortensen's wife is pregnant). Then flames. But not direct flames. Director John Hillcoat would not have the viewer concentrate on the destruction, but on the result of the destruction. The flames are seen through diaphanous curtains. Who lives? Who ""makes it""? Who defies the odds? This is not the story of destruction, but, oddly, one of life.

Then fast-forward about nine, ten years. Dark. Desolate. Grimy. Stark. Utter destruction. A dying earth. Few people. No animals. Devastation everywhere.

""The Road"" focuses on two players, father and son, with the road as powerful a symbol as I've ever seen. Papa (Viggo) is a loving, gentle man (now and before) who is driven to get his son to the Pacific coast. Why? We're never told, it's a psychic thing, an archetype of major magnitude. The road to the coast! It's life-rendering.

However, this is a film that defies review writing because of the likely possibility of inadvertently providing potential spoilers. Since there is little more I can say, I want to express impressions.

1. Director Hillcoat made an excellent choice with Mortensen, who has that ""sweetness"" of character necessary for this role, yet can also play killers.
2. Exact costuming is essential and very successful.
3. Humanity in both its extremes is expressed. That powerful will-to-survive can manifest in anyone.
4. Will-to-survive: What causes one person to have it and another not to? Although this will-to-survive is not the major issue here, the director does cause the viewer to consider it. Is man born with hope beyond all reason? Is this a good thing or not? Charlize Theron's character gives us another answer.
5. If will-to-survive is a predominating factor, is there room for loving kindness toward one's fellow survivors?
6. That consideration raises the main questions of the film: Who are the good people? What makes good people in this apocalyptic devastation? The answers are absolutely definitive and brook no deviation: We don't eat people. We carry the fire.

Although the ending is manipulated (with Author Cormac McCarthy and Director Hillcoat as gods/creators with intentional plans), it is perfect as closure to the plot's premise and then development.

I wish I could say more. I had no idea what my reaction to the film would be, knowing in advance that it is depressing. Although it is depressing, make no mistake about that, it is also strangely uplifting. It shows man at his best even during the worst.",1275177600,3,2666,5.086956521739131

3578913,5,B001FB5634,"Director John Hillcoat has done the best cinematic vision of the end of the world that I have ever seen. I was hesitant,at first, to embrace a film version of Cormac Mccarthy's book because of the images that were brought forth from his beautifully written prose.  But Hillcoat and his brilliant cohorts have done it.  The photography and effects are brilliant and give you the dusty, ash like feeling from the book that makes you want to blow on your clothes while you're watching. The music score wraps itself around the atmosphere like the layers of clothes worn by the characters.  The cast is amazing-Viggo Mortenson with his haunting face, Charlize Theron showing her mental state eroding with every flashback, and Kodi Smit-McPhee stealing the show as the ever learning son.  The cameo by Robert Duvall should be seen by everyone who dreams of becoming an actor.  Watching him reminds us of how much an important thespian he has always been throughout the years, I defy anyone to sit through his performance and not shed a tear.  Many generations of movies have given us the apocalypse but always with a bit of the Science Fiction genre intruding into the storyline.  Here we have the bleakest no holds barred vision of a dying humanity ever committed to celluloid. The DVD is presented in its widescreen format of 2.35:1 with excellent 5.1 Dolby sound, has a great making of documentary and includes deleted scenes and a full audio commentary by Director John Hillcoat  Recommended.",1275004800,5,1490,4.884920634920635
3578914,5,B001FB5634,"THE ROAD is a beautifully rendered, heart smelting experience.  The acting is first rate, and the plot moves in an unrelenting manner.  The simple things we take for granted are shown here to be something special.  The dark and graying landscape of the film is beautiful in an almost ""sick-at-heart"" way.  The setting is replete with the fear and hopelessness that post apocalyptic thrillers excel at.

 Yet...

The whole film is a comment on the love between a son and his father.  Despite the evil that surrounds them, the father tries his best to teach his son a better way.  We see the goodness in the son's beliefs and attitude.  We see an imperfect father that is trying to differentiate between the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys.  His son wants to help when he can, but the father's protective nature hinders this.  We see the father make mistakes and his own son serves as a moral compass that leads his ""papa"" back to the right thing.  In the end, trust becomes the highest achievement.  The son seems to me to represent all that is good in the world and the father represents those of us that have become jaded by the trials of life.  The absence of the divine seems clear in a world abandoned by all hope.  Yet, the son embodies the divine spark assuring us that good has not been driven from the world.  This is a story of starvation from a physical and spiritual standpoint.  The focus on suicide and hopelessness is so powerfully rendered that it stays with the audience for long days after the curtain has closed.  Some may see the negative existentialist worldview of Nietzsche or the survival of the fittest perspective of Darwin, but what truly shines about the film is its depiction of humanity's reach for more.  In the end, we see the values of goodness, love, and the sanctity of life.  There is a reach for the spiritual and a desire to return to lawful society.  While I felt some gray depression after the movie ended, it affirmed just how valuable each of us are.  It made me examine my own pettiness and reaffirmed the values I hold dear.  It is amazing that each of us needs a reset of our perspective from time to time.  THE ROAD is ultimately successful in pointing us towards that which is truly important:  The love, value and dignity that is given to us and the love, value and dignity that we must give to others if we are to truly comprehend what is means to be human.",1275004800,8,2404,4.481566820276497
3578915,4,B001FB5634,"There is something about the Apocalypse and post-apocalyptic worlds which kindles fascination in the minds of many.  It makes for an exciting setting and backdrop for both books, movies and video games and often comes across as ""cool"", no matter how brutal life is portrayed.  You see pain, you see suffering, you see exploitation and you see death, but you want more.  At least I always did, as did most people I knew who were fans of the genre.  The Omega Man, The Road Warrior, Doomsday, I Am Legend and the more recent The Book of Eli were just plain awesome movies where you couldn't help but want to check that world out for yourself, at least temporarily.

The Road does away with these foolish fantasies.  The world is grim and forsaken just as in other movies but it is in no way inviting.  I wanted no part in what it's dying civilization had to offer and this was all because of one simple reason, fear.  The sense of vulnerability and paranoia was constant throughout the film.  The story is about a boy and his father, two ordinary people living in extraordinary circumstances.  The father is no superman, he is thin, frail, getting up there in years and carries nothing more than a pistol with two bullets.  These bullets aren't even for defense, they are for himself and his boy should they find themselves in a desperate situation they wish to avoid.  I have not read the book but when I first heard of the movie and saw Viggo Mortensen as the lead, I thought for sure he would be his usual butt kicking self to keep his son safe.  I actually looked forward to seeing him cut down enemies as he did in Lord of the Rings, A History of Violence and Eastern Promises and was even dismayed at first when I realized his character in this movie was nothing like his past action roles.  That dismay sooned faded away as I became completely engrossed in this film's storytelling.

The story itself is simple enough, and I don't want to give out any details, the jist of it is that a man and his son are headed to the coast and are constantly scavenging for food.  There are brigands all about, roaming in packs, raping, cannibalizing and looting as they see fit and the father sugar coats none of these harsh realities to his boy.  He lets him know exactly what will happen if he trusts the wrong person.  The viewer follows the father and son throughout the film and as things progress, you become just as parnoid as the father, worried about every shadow, every sound and every stranger.  Living in such a constant state of fear would be agonizing enough if it were just your own well being you had to look out for, but imagine if it was an innocent child, your own blood, that you were trying to protect?  Exactly what are you protecting him for anyways?  An uncertain future in a dying world?  Amidst all this chaos and depravity, the father not only protects his child and teaches him how to survive, but he instills good morals in his boy and emphasizes that they are the ""good guys"".  By doing this, he is preserving the innocence of childhood in his son, something we only experience once in our lives and can never get back, and he does this in a wretched world where unspeakable acts are spoken about regularly.

The cinematography is beautiful, creating the gray and uninviting look you would expect this dead world to have.  The acting is top notch and convincing, and the direction hits the nail on the head by guiding the film in a slow but determined pace.  There is nothing cool, edgy or exciting about a post-apocalyptic world.  The Road is a good smack in the face to all the naive dreamers out there.  There is no Mad Max or Denzel to protect the innocent, just a day by day struggle for survival where death is described as one of life's ""luxuries"".",1274918400,6,3777,4.482456140350878

The Road..says all this and adds nothing more..are we all so ignorant of our past that this movie seems to add to our view of what might happen in the future..? History shows what humans are capable of when faced with death..We shouldn't need a movie to remind us of it.. but it seems that Hollywood thinks we do..so post-apocalyptic movies are the trend that never ends...they still work in product placement...in The Road..Daddy offers his son a treat..a familar can of soda and daddy drinks from a bottle of a very well known brand of alcoholic beverage..still selling products in movies about the end of life as we know it..They know the truth..it is just a movie and a boring,depressing movie at that.

3578948,5,B001FB5634,"Viggo Mortenson deserved a best actor nomination for this, if not a win. Seriously, they pick a slug like George Clooney (who plays himself in every movie, no variation) for a nomination over Viggo? I also think this movie deserved a best picture nomination as well, this was certainly much better than some of the movies they picked.

Bottom line, everything about this movie is five stars,I don't remember the last time i was so emotionally connected to the characters in a movie (i nearly cried at the ending).

The basic plot of the movie is the journey of a man (Viggo Mortenson) and his son (neither character is given a name) as they travel across a post apocalyptic wasteland that was the United States. I don't want to give away too much of the story

This is a very depressing and sad movie as a whole, because you get up close and personal with the two main character's pathetic lives. They just keep walking, picking up food where they can, which is extremely hard to find (at one point they are shown eating bugs), and avoiding ""the bad guys"", who travel in large groups and eat people. I really felt for these characters in their struggle and found myself forming a huge smile when little bits of happiness went their way (don't want to give anything away, but a small example is when they find a waterfall and go swimming in it).

As a note, there are some very disturbing things that happen in this movie so if you aren't one for that kind of stuff...but if you can take it, this is easily one of the best movies of the year in every way. Very highly recommended",1274918400,,1578,4.449826989619377
3578949,1,B001FB5634,"Haven't read the book. But the film is so boring. Managed to endure it through the end. I think the whole thing plays on the human rejection, fear and fascination with a post apocalyptic world. Honestly who really cares? Sure some people will resort to anything to survive, e.g. cannabilism. But big deal it's just a reversal to our primal instincts. Man is civilized only when civilization exists. I find this whole exercise of asking what if, pretty pointless. Waste of 2 hours.

The only good scene was with Viggo putting his hand up Charlize's skirt while they were watching a concert. Typical Hollywood, had to stick some sort of sex scene even when the world was coming to an end.",1274918400,12,686,4.669421487603306
3578950,4,B001FB5634,"My wife and I saw this film, and I must say, it will capture you. It is great story telling, the acting I felt was very, very good. You often find yourself thinking, ""What would I do?"" If you were expecting a ""Road Warrior"" kind of film, it may let you down, it's a more realistic view of the world and the human spirit. Now for the warning, we found ourselves saddened throughout the film, it can be very depressing, because it leaves you with a sense of hopelessness. If this is something the directors wanted, they succeeded. It keeps your attention, and makes you feel for the situation but most importantly the characters. Viggo Mortensen, was excellent, you forget to think..""Hey, it's Aragon from LOTR's!"" Also, the some scenes are very intense, very intense, the kind of scenes that would make your child ask questions. Great film, see it!

3578951,5,B001FB5634,"I recommend this film.  The film is not the novel which is a beautiful prose poem.  But the cinematography, in dvd or blue-ray, dazzles the viewer.  The acting deserves awards.  Near the beginning of the film I think the director shows footage he took at the site of Mount Saint Helens.  But for me, the story pulled me in.  I saw the movie first and then read the book.

Rent or buy this film.  If you think the premise impossible, check a Scientific American article called, ""Nuclear Weapons in a New World"", about limited or small nuclear exchanges such as between India and Pakistan.  Such a confrontation could kick up enough dust to block the sun around much of the world, decreasing the oceanic plankton growth, for ten years.

The film version of The Road is a modern post Armageddon folktale with unlikely but necessary plot limitations, such as a scarcity rather than a total lack of food.  Like many of you, I thought about how even canned food would go bad within a few years and most other food, processed or not, would rot before the story gets to where it starts.  The implausibility of the story in no way detracts from the story.  People have suspended their disbelief while reading or hearing stories for thousands of years.  The search for food propels the plot from one scene to the next, allowing the story teller to do what he wants to do and tell his story.

As in science fiction, a cousin genre to this story, this is a story about the present.  As the fish, plant life, animals other than humans, die at a very fast pace around this planet Earth, more every day, we all might be characters in this story.  Today, humans judge one another very strongly, and quickly, to be bad people, if not dark and evil.  We see a predator around every corner.  Our families are separated from other families and individuals are separated by ideas and beliefs.  There may be seven billion people in the world but friend is lining up against friend, ideas are lining up against ideas.  One billion people, more than there were people in the world one hundred and fifty years ago, live close to starvation around the world today, including in the United States of America.  Rich or poor, although we need to protect our children, many of us believe we need to protect our children from other people and other ideas.

Without going too deeply into the story for those who want to read or watch it, Cormac McCarthy spell bounds the reader or listener with his character development of a father and his son trying to survive in a world where they need to feel some purpose and meaning by inventing goals, such as traveling south or to the ocean, without knowing whether going south will help their circumstances in any way.  In a world where most of the human race and most animals have died because of some vague catastrophe, this father wants, rather than needs, to raise his son.  (The book gives more clues about the cause of the planetary wide mass extinction of life on Earth.)  Even his mother could not dig deep enough inside herself to want to go on living in a world without enough other people and without a society holding people together.  No social system exists any longer to tell anyone what is right or wrong, good or bad, or good and evil.  The boy's father finds books to teach his son to read in a world that does not include humans in its future.  The father passes his message of civilization onto his son the only way he can.  While telling his son about a world with a community of people, the two of them live separate from the few other people alive in the world who are broken down into either the good people or the cannibals.  As the plot progresses, this dichotomy of good and cannibal blurs.  The boy rarely sees any other people.  When he does, they are starving and trying to survive the only way they know how.  Sometimes they don't behave so well.  If they eat other people, they are called cannibals.  The final scene in the story, after the father dies, shows the boy reaching out to others.

There are other scenes earlier where the boy reaches out to an old man and another where he reaches out to the first other boy close to his own age he has ever seen.  His father grabs him and stops him from communicating with the old man and tells the boy not to hold his hand.  For one evening, the father shares some food and conversation with the old man.  But the father believes getting attached to another human being is too great a risk.  The next morning he tells the old man to go his own way.  The father believes he cannot afford to trust anyone.  When the boy, by chance, sees another fearful boy walk by, he chases him only to have his father stop him.  The boy wants to bring trust back into the world and associate with other people.  Before a child is ten years old, he will play with any other child, until his parent tells him he does not want him playing with a child who has cancer, cerebral palsy, autism, a different color skin, a different religion, a different nationality, a parent with liberal ideas, and the list can go on for pages.

But, the boy does learn a story about people being good to one another, from his father, that he can pass on to others in spite of the fact that every waking traumatic moment is a horror to the father and this is the only world the boy knows.  Cannibalistic groups of men and women hunt other humans for food and a violent death is an ever present fact throughout the story.  The reader or viewer needs to suspend disbelief once again.  Young children growing up with Europe as their playground during World War Two learned a different lesson while they scrapped for food in and out of the towns.  But such children still had a world of people out there, not participating directly in the war, holding the infrastructure of society together.  McCarthy gives this boy no such world.  Yet, with one insect finally flying by our protagonist, the viewer feels hope, if not for humans, then for life on the earth.

And this is where we the reader might notice something.  If you saw or read McCarthy's story No Country for Old Men, you might remember something about someone mentioning carrying the fire in the horn.  Once again, in this story the characters pass on the fire from one generation to the next.  This is what the father does, the son learns to do, and Cormac McCarthy continues to do.

This is a story about the present.  This is not a story about the future.",1274832000,2,6466,4.463768115942029
3578952,5,B001FB5634,"Of course, no film can ever match the prose of a book if it is based on one, especially as concerns Cormac McCarthy's stark, raw writing.  However, the film version of The Road captures the bleak intensity, desperation, determination, and love very well.  The man's singular mission in what remains of his life is to keep his boy alive and teach him some survival skills in a post-nuclear wasteland, where there are very few animals or plants left, there is no law and order, and cannibals roam the countryside looking for victims.  It's not easy to watch, for sure, but it is worth it for the power of the relationship between father and son.

Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee are outstanding in their roles, as is Robert Duvall as an old man losing his sight.",1274832000,3,765,4.644444444444445

Like science, their simple elegance and unceasing truth are exultant.  This film is the best of last year, but snubbed by most major awards, altough an overall winner with critics.  Hollywood is afraid of films like this; a film with honesty and no sentimentality.  Moments of violence that are not stylized but horrible.

It seems that the film industry has finally learned how to film McCarthy: let outsiders do it, and let it be close to the book.  The Coens are auters of the highest order and nailed ""No Country"".  Hillcoat nails ""The Road"".  Only time will tell if Hollywood (and the film ratings board) allows Todd Field to nail ""Blood Meridian"".  Somehow I doubt it.",1274832000,,791,4.666666666666667

It's easy to understand, in a post apocalyptic world a man and his son struggle to survive in the most basic sense of the word - food, shelter, and warmth - not to freeze, get killed or eaten, and not to starve.

The acting is exceptional.  I didn't pick the movie out, but I sat there through the whole thing with my eyes glued to the screen, even as I got uncomfortable at the suspense in some parts.  The suspense is not what I'd call gripping - it's very well done, more realistic, sometimes queasy might be a better word for it than griping.

Some might find it disturbing.  It really was.

I'd give it a full 5 stars but a few things just didn't make sense to me, probably because I didn't read the book.  I can't figure out why all the bugs, plants and animals died, but there were still people.  The earth obviously had not been sterilized, but nothing was growing.  I wanted to know why but it never said. Were the oceans dead too? I could have used a bit more explanation about that.

Definitely worth seeing.",1274832000,2,1109,4.228571428571429
3578955,4,B001FB5634,"Movies have made the best out of the post apocalyptic future genre. Mel Gibson became a star with the first MAD MAX film. During the early eighties, films featuring bands of marauding gangs played drive ins across the land and ended up on video. But these looks into the future, while violent, never seemed as bleak as THE ROAD does.

We're presented with a story that moves back and forth in time, showing us what was, what happened and what is now going on. Viggo Morensen is the Father, a man who has taken on the task of trying to protect and raise his son in a world that has fallen apart. No reason is given, but the world has changed. Animals have disappeared, plant life is all but gone leaving barren woods and fields and food is in short supply.

On occasion, the earth continues its decay with a tremor or full blown mini-earthquake while they travel. But worse than this is the packs of people, remnants of humanity gone wild who travel along preying on the weak. These people not only have clung together to track down people, they have taken on the habit of eating them as well just to stay alive.

Traveling south and west, Father is trying to get his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to a safe place. Following the road southwest and heading for the coast, the pair comes across a variety of people and places. A family that keeps people in the basement to eat when they need. An old man (Robert Duvall) on the same road who they share a meal with. A thief who takes their possessions but expects mercy when caught. All play a part in the story of what humanity remains in these two characters.

In flashbacks, we learn of Father's wife (Charlize Theron) who was pregnant when it all began. While others afterwards took the suicide path rather than face the new world, Father convinced her to have hope and carry on. But this eventually resulted in her resenting the fact they brought a child into this new world as well as his not letting her leave on her own terms. What happens with her is predictable, but sad none the less.

As Father and Son travel the byways of a once prosperous world, they witness buildings falling into ruin, highways crumbling apart and an entire world that offers nothing more than the colors gray and brown. But the pair travel on.

The movie is not so much about how to survive in the world after. It is a character study of two people, father and son, who are attached not just genetically but through a deeply bound love of one another. Father is not in the best of health and knows his days are numbered. His role is to train his son to survive, to carry on, harboring that fire within oneself that holds on to the remains of humanity. The question is always there and the son asks it now and then:""Are we the good guys?""

The movie doesn't involve itself with a straight structure moving forward with a nice neat ending. Instead it tells the tale of these two while involving the viewer at the same time. And before the final reel, you find yourself caring for them both, hoping for the best and knowing deep down that the happy ending seems further away no matter how far down the road they travel.

Mortensen is a force to be reckoned with. He IS this character. He brings to it a depth that digs beneath the surface, displaying the deep love this father has for his son and the fears of what will happen when he is no longer there. Smit-McPhee does an equally admirable job, especially for an actor so young. His range may not be as deep, but his performance of a young boy trying to cope with a tumultuous world is one that is more than believable.

All in all, this post apocalyptic world seems more real than any previously seen. No leather clad bad boys driving around on souped up death machines. No trading centers where people barter services for goods. This is a world where people do what they can to survive. But at its root is the question is all that's left is just surviving? Or is there something more to staying on this earth than simply existing? The only person that can answer these questions is the viewer. Because each and every person who watches must answer the question on their own.",1274745600,3,4150,4.435695538057743
3578986,4,B001FB5634,"Cormac McCarthy's novel ""The Road"" doesn't top most lists of ""filmable"" books.  There's really no plot: a father and son travel south in post-apocalyptic America.  Like most of McCarthy's work, the novel is about inner conflict.  It's an ultimately hopeful tale set in a world of utter hopelessness, and perhaps ranks as McCarthy's one true ""uplifting"" novel.

THE ROAD follows a similar suit.  In fact, though some minor things have been changed, it is an incredibly faithful adaptation.  It lacks some of the novel's subtlety, but that's only to be expected.  If the book hadn't been so popular (thanks Oprah), the film would probably never have been made.  The fact that someone actually decided to make this movie (and keep it close to the book) shows that there is still hope left in cinema.

The question is, did they pull it off?  More or less.  Everything pretty much hinges around John Hillcoat's direction and Viggo Mortensen's performance.  Hillcoat, director of the superb Australian western THE PROPOSITION (penned by this film's masterful composer, Nick Cave), keeps things bleak and dreary.  Even the camera angles, the color of the landscape (superb, by the way), the fall of the shadows...this film almost goes out of its way to depress the hell out of you.  As for Mortensen, he's delivered some fine cinematic performances before, but never quite on this scale.  I won't say this is his best performance to date, but it's certainly right up there.  He perfectly captures the angry love of a father for his son, love that almost borders on greed, the kind of love that actually requires a father to put a gun to his son's head.  Mortensen's performance will linger.

The rest of the film may not.  Or it may, depending on if you've read the book, and if this kind of movie is your thing.  All of the performances are rock-solid; Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Garrett Dillahunt, and Guy Pearce all make the best of their respective cameos, and Kodi Smit-McPhee as the son is spectacular.  But the script is only so-so; faithful, yes, but we would have liked to have seen an extra spark to it, something to give McCarthy's already-beautiful prose visual life.  The end result is a film that is very well-made, but not as deep or penetrating as we might want it.  Dreary, yes; it's not for everyone.  If you like feel-good stories, then stay away; McCarthy's idea of hope borders on some people's concept of despair.  Yet, for those of you who enjoy a well-made film that serves as proof that quality filmmaking is not dead, then check out THE ROAD. It's well worth your while.",1274745600,6,2594,4.788288288288288
3578987,5,B001FB5634,"""You must think I'm from another world"" the Father (Viggo Mortensen) tells his young Son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they traverse a post-apocalyptic landscape as they attempt to fend off starvation and cannibal marauders alike.  Adapted from Cormac McCarthy's Pulitzer Prize-winning book by director John Hillcoat (The Proposition), The Road is by all means bleak, depressing, and incredibly compelling.  What appears to be a relatively ""simple"" story of the journey of a father and son is anything but, however it is their relationship and their journey that is what makes The Road as impressive as it is, regardless of its ""end of the world"" backdrop.  Mortensen in particular is nothing less than spectacular in the lead role, giving a performance that ranks in his recent chain of spectacular performances as being the very best.  Make no mistake that while The Road offers a quite vivid picture of a post-apocalyptic world and the degredation of humanity that follows, there is a small glimmer of hope at the end of this road, even if it seems to dim the longer the film goes on for.  That in itself is the one flaw with The Road, is that as a film it does more often than not tend to feel a bit drawn out.  That aside, for its close to two-hour running time, The Road and Mortensen both manage to impress.  The Road may not be a film that just anyone can easily swallow, but for fans of McCarthy's book or Mortensen, this is wholeheartedly worth your time.  Also featuring small, but memorable, roles from Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Guy Pearce, Garret Dillahunt, and The Wire vet Michael Kenneth Williams.",1274745600,,1611,4.811594202898551
3578988,4,B001FB5634,"What makes this story so good is that it's as real as it can be.  There are no special effects, no heroes, no computer generated fight scenes.  It's just a film about a man and his son, against what's left of the world and anyone else that has survived in it.  It's not a pretty film; it's not a romantic film, but still it's hauntingly touching and realistic.

The film is dark, and at times, there are a few scenes in the film that are disturbing and hard to stomach.  Overall, the movie did leave a lasting impression on me.  How could it not?  In the midst of a disaster, what's the scariest thing in the world one could be faced with? For me, the answer to this question would be trying to save your child's life, and trying to survive and hold onto your own life for the sake of saving that child's life.

You want action and animated special effects? Don't see this film. If you are looking for something a little more realistic, a little more human (cause let's face it, in real life people die, people don't conveniently find guns laying around when they need it and we all don't posses the ability to flip up in the air and bounce off walls, if we're faced with a life or death situation) then, hey this film could be for you.

Here's a fair warning for those who have children or that are surrounded by children in their lives, this film may depress you and may even make you cry.  It may even give you insight on the lives of homeless people, but that's just my opinion.",1271894400,6,1482,4.260714285714286

The book, however, is not able to catch the velvety texture of the book because it simply a three dimensional representation of the book. That said, the movie does offer a great representation of a very important question. The question is: ""What would you be willing to do for your soon?"" Would you be willing to kill your soon to prevent him from being cannibalized and eaten? Maybe not, but the main character in this movie is forced to consider that very question throughout the entire movie. In the process, we are offered a seat from which to watch while he wrestles with this decision.

The book had very little dialog, the characters were never really developed, and no questions in regard to how their situation came about were addressed. In effect it was a tale of a father and son surviving. Period. There were no extended plans for a better life, just survival one day at a time. I found it to be dreary, depressing, and largely without a coherent direction. The movie does a decent job of bringing the bleak hopelessness of the novel to the screen, and maybe a better job of forming an attachment to the characters, but overall I found the same lack of hope and direction. I found the story to be a good intellectual exercise, but as entertainment I can certainly understand why the movie didn't fare well.",1269820800,5,840,4.532894736842105
3578993,4,B001FB5634,"Do you want to die? No, it is foolish to ask for luxuries in this world. (Question by Viggo Mortensen's character to Robert Duvall's, with the answer)

I am not an admirer of McCarthy's writing. I find it much overrated. I tried two of his novels and categorized them as `style over substance'. I disliked the movie `No Country for Old Men' and got a lot of flak here for saying so. Why did I watch The Road at all? Out of spite? Mainly out of curiosity, and then a general interest in the genre: some kind of apocalypse has happened, and then what? We have a fusion of the lonely island genre of Crusoe & Co with the science fiction specialty of the post-apocalyptic world, like in Mad Max or in I am Legend.

In summary: this film is much better than I expected. Can one make an interesting movie based on nothing but tristesse and hunger and cold and hostile nature and the assumption that anything alive will try to eat you? Yes, one can, if one has this Danish madman Viggo Mortensen for the main part. An absolutely brilliant performance.
There is not much of a plot, it is a linear tale and there are few surprises. A father walks southwards to the sea in a wintry desolation after almost everyone else has died. Food is hard to find, shelter is often dangerous, any other homo sapiens is mainly suspicious and dangerous. Animals seem to have been eradicated in a wholesale way.

I would propose that you turn off your DVD or walk out of the movie theatre 5 minutes before the end, but I can't tell you why I propose that, for spoiler control reasons. Only so much: another nice bit part for Guy Pearce. (Is the man out of leading parts?)",1269734400,4,1645,4.369281045751634

It stars Viggo Mortensen as ""The Man"" who has survived the apocalypse and is now taking care of his young son and trying to keep them both alive, struggling against exhaustion, starvation and cannibals. I knew from reading the book that this wouldn't be a happy film, in fact you couldn't get much further from it. That doesn't stop it from being an exciting and heartbreaking film exploring man's will to survive and the love that he has for his son.

The film is beautifully shot, being partly filmed in post-Katrina New Orleans (as well as Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Oregon, I believe), the scenery is bleak, cold and depressing and most importantly authentically destroyed land, but is equally breathtaking and extremely atmospheric. Acting from Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee is very believable and their bond together did feel genuine to me and mirrored the characters of the novel perfectly. The story is just about survival a coping with the end of the world, basically - nothing more, nothing less. I particularly liked how you never really know why the whole of the human race has been wiped out, so that part of the story is left completely up to you to decide or guess.

The Road is a very haunting and quite powerful film that is very faithful to the novel, but didn't quite make the impact that the book did as it is always harder to feel what the characters do in a movie as opposed to using your own imagination when reading their emotions in a well written piece of literature. This is no fault of the film though, so don't let that put you off. I definitely rate this highly and will most certainly purchase it on Blu Ray or DVD when it is released.",1269475200,7,2127,5.422960725075528
3578995,4,B001FB5634,"Someone asked me if I liked The Road, upon watching it. I had no answer. The Road is just one of those films that is too hard to describe. Is the movie good? Well, yes it is-that is a far easier question to answer. I have read the book and must say that the film really does it justice. It is bleak, dreary, utterly depressing and flawlessly acted.

Viggo Mortensen is a man with no name, who, alone with his son (also no name) is attempting to survive what seems to be some sort of apocalypse. We never see what transpired-we only see the aftermath. We are not given a timeline, though you can judge for yourself how long man and son have been attempting to 'live'. Mortensen carries the entire film on his weathered and weary shoulders. I cannot gush enough about his performance-in any film really. But here, you only have to look into his eyes-so full of soul and despair to realise that not only is this man acting, he is really and truly transformed. Just incredible really.

The atmosphere is grainy and desolate, without color of any kind and as you watch, you slowly go mad envisioning what you would do in such a situation. The film features horrors that include cannibalism and at one point, you see the father teach his son how to properly kill himself if anything should ever happen to him. Very disturbing.

By film's end, you are mentally exhausted. This is not a fast-paced film at all. It is purposefully slow-going and I believe that was done with the intent to transport you inside the film itself, and in my mind, it succeeds. After the credits started to roll, I found myself depressed for the rest of the day. This is probably one of the most desolate films I've ever seen, so I would avoid it if you like your films with satisfying ending-because this isn't it.",1269302400,308,1784,4.466257668711656
3579035,5,B001FB5634,"I almost fully agree when people say, ""The book is always better than the movie."" but with 'The Road' by Cormac McCarthey, the movie really does it justice. I felt for once, the movie is just as good as the book and delivers the same grim feeling throughout the story along with the instensity of every moment. The acting was phenomonal and the movie's plot was laid out almost exactly like the book. I would give both the book and the movie, 5 stars",1268265600,10,450,4.369047619047619
3579036,5,B001FB5634,"I was astounded at the raw and gritty portrayal of humanity driven to desperation in ""The Road."" Cormac McCarthy's novel was beautifully written, and this movie adaptation does it justice (in my opinion). The strength of the movie lies in the visceral performance by Viggo Mortensen, the depiction of the loving relationship between a father and his son, and the realistic sets and compelling visuals of the barren landscape - a world where there are no visible animals, where trees have long since shed their leaves, where the ocean itself has long since ceased to be blue, and where humanity is hardly evidenced. There are not many humans in this movie - the main characters, a man and his young son (played by Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee) are on a journey, more of a quest really, to reach the coast, where they hope there will be some hope for survival. The wife and mother (Charlize Theron) is seen via flashbacks,and the viewer gradually learns her fate. Almost all of the other 'humans' in this movie, are barely people anymore, just rampaging creatures driven by a need to satiate their hunger...creatures who devour their own kind. Yes, there are many graphic visuals of cannibalism here...as Viggo Mortensen's character says at the beginning of the movie, ""Cannibalism is the great fear.""

Will humanity really be driven to this when the end comes? What semblance of one's self will remain? Neither the book nor the movie tell us what caused this devastation on Earth, yet that is besides the point. The story addresses the basic motivations that drive people - when there is nothing left, what does one do - maintain decency, hope, and love, or prey upon others? The father's eternal love for his son, and the son's instinctual desire for mercy and compassion are compellingly portrayed. It is this that kept me hopeful as the credits rolled.",1267142400,11,1862,4.873817034700315

At a basic level the film is sevicably faithful to the book. The visuals of the postapocalyptic world are striking and convincing. The acting is good, and Viggo Mortenson fully embodies the character of the man.

There are two things that primarily work against the film. First, the evocative power of McCarthy's prose is simply untranslatable to film. The story alone is not particularly compelling. Second, the film indulges in too much sentimentality. This occurs through the repetitive flashbacks to the man's wife, through some of the encounters and exchanges with strangers, and finally in the somewhat overwrought ending.

In the end, I was left unmoved by the experience, and felt no emotional connection to film. While the novel is destined to be a long remembered classic, this film seems destined to fall into the dustbins of memory long before the apocalypse ever arrives.",1266537600,30,1050,5.281437125748503
3579039,5,B001FB5634,"Most adapted screenplays are a shortened version of the original work, the successful screenwriter having found the shorter story that is the cinematic story; or they are a restatement of the original work that shifts the perspective. ""The Road"" was a short enough book to allow a direct, nearly page-for-page adaptation without yielding a four-hour film. A direct adaptation is what screenwriter Joe Penhall and director John Hillcoat accomplished. This transition from page to screen without any retreat from Cormac McCarthy's presentation of sheer and utter survival is remarkable. It's also curious, in that the screen story is a bit more hopeful, or at least slightly less grim, than the book.

As I read ""The Road"" I had to push myself emotionally to finish the book - I found the story and McCarthy's writing to be that compelling, and therefore emotionally enervating. I wondered very seriously if I could watch the movie. At a friend's urging I did go, and I'm glad I did.

The story, in short, is a man and his son making their way south by foot, following roads indicated on a tattered road map. The two have already begun their trek as the story begins, after surviving a decade living in this post-apocalyptic world. As in the book, the viewer is made to wonder how long he or she would spend every waking minute just surviving and nothing else, and by just surviving I mean finding a way to continue the metabolism of your body, and nothing more. No joy, no civilization. Would that endless struggle be worth willing oneself to use each conscious moment to do nothing but get to the next?

Vigo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee make an unforgettable team as a father devoted in complete selflessness to his son, and as a boy who, at the age of ten or so - having had no developmental childhood, having barely even seen another child in his life - lives at many ages. As expressed a little more explicitly in the book, the boy is virtually the only reason the man continues. That, and the tiny joys and happiness that, in fact, do emerge, if only in cruel sparseness. Those, and the civilization one can keep within oneself, or between two. The fire.

I am not a religious person at all, but neither have I ever thought life to be simply an equation. And so by the final scene I did hold the man, the boy and the rescuing family at a higher level than the man's wife, and the various unknown suicides displayed along the journey. Even under the best of circumstances, everything across history and pre-history has always depended on those who go on anyway, regardless, even when how to go on is unknown, maybe unknowable. Within immeasurable misery, perhaps moving ahead of Death until circumstances beyond your body and mind and will say otherwise is better - has meaning - than inviting Death to overtake you. This effort allows the whole to be greater than the sum. Maybe within the gap between the mere sum and the greater whole is the point of it all.",1266364800,8,2967,4.667304015296367
3579040,2,B001FB5634,"I had loosely read some of the book but was never terribly interested in it. I found it to be atmpospheric and poetic in writing but it lacked a basic storyline. Having read other post-apocalyptic books like 'on the beach', 'alas Babylon' and 'Earth Abides' I was truly astonished this book was favoured on the big screen.

The setting in which each scene took place often took the book an entire section to describe. This was the book's most important quality because of the way the writer spun his words to make such eloquent visualisations of the environment and relate it to the chilling moments that ensued. But as a film this was realised in just one single frame. The vivid experience of words is lost on the movie screen and we are really left with only a basic story about a man and his son trying to survive in a dark and desolate landscape.

It leaves one to realise just how insignificant the grand story really is. Where is this story going? And the ending is as contrived as one would expect when ... well... when there is nothing to expect.

And for all the little moments we invest our time with, I never truly felt involved. I just didn't feel it necessary to realise the romance, the helplessness, the desperation, the survival, the loss, the destruction, the decay, the gruesomeness, the fear, the father's anguish, the son's loneliness, their relationship... all of it.. I knew it was there to be admired... but it was all a bit formulaic for some reason. Mostly because I realised this very early on, and the story doesnt do much in the way of character progression and arch-lines. What we start with is what we end with, and in between are but a few incidents.

Right up to the end, I simply walked away exhausted yet untouched.",1265241600,10,1750,4.563694267515924

Roughly a decade after some catastrophic event has ravaged the world, a man (Viggo Mortenson), his wife (Charlize Theron), and their son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) fearfully struggle to survive, scavenging whatever they can to nourish their increasingly emaciated bodies, and looking over their shoulder whenever the wind howls or a floorboard creaks.  Told through flashbacks, the man wishes to be thankful, and to hold on to precious life while the mother believes the only feasible option lies within the fateful crank of a revolver and a few remaining bullets.

Awash in hues of light blue and gray, the world itself is a rival, devoid of animals or plant-life, providing nearly no support.  The locations and filming aid the depressed feeling as each devastating frame bleeds hope dry.  The world exudes death.  The lack of cause regarding Earth's demise is inconsequential; the care for history is disregarded.  For the man and his boy, only the struggle to survive and appreciation of every hushed breath are important.  The man and his son pilgrimage south towards uncertainty and the hope of possible sustenance.  The story unfolds like an good versus evil parable, as the pair must avoid the ""bad guys,"" those who have devolved towards murder, rape, and cannibalism as a means for survival; and hope for the ""good guys,"" like an old man (Robert Duvall) they happen upon during their march south.  It's a world so foreign that a flat coke is better than ten Christmas mornings, and the concept of a meat locker takes on a vision as gruesome as any I've seen on film (the scene haunts me days after its viewing).

The pacing of the movie is a bit slow, with the first two acts slowly destroying hope, but that's the purpose.  Gut wrenchingly realistic, only the hope and optimism of the man and his boy shine brightly as they ""carry the fire"" to live.

In a Hollywood landscape saturated with unoriginality, The Road is authentically barren and depressing.  More than likely, the stark realities of survival paint a picture of the future in blood with a fibula paintbrush.  For the post-apocalyptic pessimist like myself, this incredible film represents reality, and Academy Awards should be awarded en masse to all involved, especially Viggo Mortenson.

STARRING: Viggo Mortensen, Kodi Smit-McPhee, Charlize Theron, Robert Duvall, Garret Dillahunt, Guy Pearce, Molly Parker and Michael K. Williams

WRITTEN BY: Joe Penhall; based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy

DIRECTED BY: John Hillcoat

Rated: R
Genre: Drama / Thriller
Release Date: 25 November 2009

The Road was released on the 25th of November; the day before Thanksgiving. While it may not seem like a very appropriate film to watch on Thanksgiving Day, nothing could be further from the truth. No film has ever made you feel more thankful for what you have, than The Road.

Based on the sensational Pulitzer Prize Winning Novel by Cormac McCarthy; The Road will move you and it will haunt you.

I knew that this review was going to be a difficult one to write because I read the book prior to seeing the film. I have only done that one other time. I like to see the movie, then read the book and picture the character as the actor from the film.

When I read The Road, I already knew the film was coming out, so I was able to envision Viggo Mortensen as the character he portrays in the film: The Man. But I swear to you when I was reading the book it seemed like Cormac McCarthy had written it directly for Viggo. I couldn't picture anyone else as this character. Every line of The Man's dialogue I read in the book came out in Viggo's voice.  Whoever cast him for this film is a genius. He is perfect and will at the very least be nominated for an Oscar. Along with Johnny Depp in Public Enemies, this is the best male performance in a lead role I've seen this year. He is more than believable as a man desperate and willing to do absolutely anything to protect his son. He is a dying man starving to death but you never doubt for a second that he will keep fighting until the last breath of air has left his lungs.

The Man is the father of The Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and they are struggling to survive the end of the world. We don't know exactly what has happened but we know that nearly everyone is dead and America has been raped, pillaged and left to die, burning in the wind.

We know it has been several years since the unknown event took place, because food, clothing, weapons and gasoline are nearly impossible to come by.

The few people that still roam the earth are hardly, ""the good guys"" that The Boy refers to him and his father as. ""The bad guys"" are thieves, rapists, murderers and sometimes even cannibals who capture people and turn them into slaves for which to feed upon; and they rarely travel alone.

In a lawless land, who is there to stop them? When you look at how we treat each other on the morning of Black Friday, you can't help but wonder if this is really that far-off from what the world would become without a civilized society.

The Man has a revolver with two bullets to protect his child against whatever evil may lurk in the shadows. With only the clothes on their backs and a few items that they push along in an old grocery cart; their mission is to reach the coast. They have no idea what awaits them there, but it is somewhere to go. It is the only thing keeping them going, and perhaps alive.

As great as it was, there are a few problems I had with the film. One was the length of it. I felt that especially towards the end, too many important details were omitted from the novel and that the film would have been better served with at least an additional 30 minutes. Yes, that would have made it long, but I would have preferred it that way. It's supposed to be a gut-wrenching journey that leaves you exhausted.

Another problem I had with the film was the narration of The Man. He explains what has been going on and fills us in on a lot of his thoughts. We rarely (if ever) know his thoughts in the book and that's one of the elements that make it so good. Less is more, if you will. However, had I not read the novel, I probably would have no problem with this at all. You have to look at this as a film because that's what it is. It's not the book; so maybe it's ok. A film needs certain elements in it that a book does not. I'm sure Cormac McCarthy will be more than pleased and agree with me that they did more than a fair job of adapting his beloved novel to the screen.

Part of the film that I actually preferred compared to what was written in the book, was the scene where they make a horrific discovery in the basement of a farm house. You'll know the one I mean. In the book they flee the house and take shelter outside just before the occupants return and the danger is minimal. While that was still entertaining, the film takes that scene to a darker level. They are not able to escape right away and must hide in the house with these people and we all learn of their dark secret and it's very riveting and exciting.

I also like in the film that we get to know the character of The Woman more. She is played brilliantly by Charlize Theron. Charlize should see an Oscar nomination as well. The Woman is a deeply tortured soul. We meet her only in a series of flashbacks; some of which show when things weren't so bad and others show them gradually getting worse. She is beyond aggravated by the events happening around her as the world is coming to its end and she looks at life completely different from her husband, The Man. She thinks they should just give up and throw in the towel and for him this is just not an option. These are some of the most powerful scenes in the movie. The chemistry between these two for the tiny amount of screen time they share is remarkable.

Another character I would like to comment on is The Boy. At first I wasn't too fond of Kodi Smit-McPhee for the character of The Boy. I didn't find him to match who I had pictured when reading the novel. But the further along on his journey he gets, the more invested I became and soon enough he had me more than convinced. This child goes places with his performance that few actors his age have or should ever go. He may see an Oscar nomination as well.

On their way to the coast the two meet a sick old man. Viggo is so believable at never trusting anyone he meets in the film and you can't really blame him; they have seen some terrible things. He is even suspicious of this old man. The Old Man is none other than the incredible Robert Duvall. Had I not known to look for him, it would have taken me a while to figure out it was him. This is one of the best performances Duvall has ever given and is the farthest from anything you have ever seen him do. I have never seen him more out of his skin than he was here. Count that one more Oscar nomination.

You can also add nominations for best picture, directing, best adapted screenplay, original score, cinematography and set design. If you take into consideration that the film is supposed to be dark and gritty and get under your skin, then you can appreciate what a beautiful piece of art it is. I'm sure they had to of used some special effects here, but I sure couldn't tell where. The sets all looked like real locations overtaken by sadness and devastation. The camera moves over them like death itself filming the final footage to ever be seen.

Throughout the entire course of the film you feel like you are right there with the characters and you are hunching down in your seat. You are looking over their shoulders for them, because it always feels like something terrible is going to happen. With that being said, I don't want to scare you away from the film. It's not a horror movie by any means and although it has these dark and sinister moments in it, it is very much an adventure. It's a grim adventure that none of us would want to go on and God willing we never will. We enjoy the ride with the characters as they are forced to go on it and we are rooting for them the whole way through.

I don't think that any film has ever shown what starving to death over a long and drawn out period of time would be like, as well as The Road has. Viggo Mortensen clearly lost a few pounds to say the least and it seems like young Kodi did as well. Your heart goes out to them whenever they find food in the film and it really makes you appreciate how good you have it. And if you have it pretty bad (as some of us do) then it makes you appreciate how much worse you could have it.

I have read plenty of books and not a single one of them ever made me cry or even come close to shedding a tear. When I read The Road, at one point I was so happy for the characters that I was nearly in tears and at another point I had tears running down my face in sorrow for them. It's pretty common for a movie to be able to do that to someone but for words on a page to do it, at least for me; was a shocker. I didn't have quite as much of an emotional response to the film but that's because my mind and heart couldn't help but compare it to the movie I had already seen in my head while reading the book. That's not necessarily fair to director John Hillcoat's majestic adaptation. I'm sure it will drag that emotion from those that have not read the book, with great ease.

If you want special effects and big Hollywood cinematic moments with your end of the world, then watch 2012. The Road is an obscure and twisted drama that will reach its retched hand down your throat and rip your guts and all of your feelings out of your body and throw them at your feet. The film has no pity on its audience or its characters. Its sole objective is to teach us and them the great lesson of how fragile and precious life truly is.",1262995200,2,9529,4.216794731064764
3579043,5,B001FB5634,"I was wary of both reading the book and seeing the movie, as I am not a person who enjoys post-apocalyptic stories. They freak me out. I had heard so many good things about the book, I decided to give it a try and was hugely rewarded. It was one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read - poetic, Biblical and essential. I think the movie can be described in much the same way. At its core, it is a love story about a father and son, and it is about choosing kindness. So many people have complained that the book and movie do not explain what causes the death of the earth - but they are totally missing the point. The setting is empty, sparse and threatening to highlight what is most important even after everything is gone. It describes the eternal bond of love and dedication this father and son have for each other. Their journey through a destroyed landscape is defined by their commitment to each other and by the challenge of ""being the good guys"". Whereas the father is sometimes pulled off course in his insistence in protecting his son, the boy insists on an almost ideal devotion to kindness and generosity.
Viggo Mortensen's performance as the father is transcendent. This role is unlike anything he's done before, and his ability to communicate such raw emotions is just breathtaking. His eyes radiate absolute desperation, grief, determination and paternal love. If he is not considered for an Oscar, it's because the voters didn't see the movie! Kodi Smit-McPhee as the boy was also stunning. Robert Duvall added enormous weight to his brief scene.",1262822400,2,1577,4.676258992805756
3579044,5,B001FB5634,"I won't repeat the theme as other reviewers have done this. Though this film does take place in a very bleak and hopeless time as others have mentioned, it still projects hope and displays intense, dedicated love. This is much of what makes the movie as good as it is. In a time when there should be no hope, the father and son hold on to each other. They search for something that they have no right to hope in, a place where they can be safe and fed. It may not even exist, yet they take to the road despite the fact that many others have given up. They choose to hope.

The relationship between the father and son was so well acted that it was very believable. Viggo Mortenson played this father determined to protect his son with such a fierce passion and vulnerability that it was mesmerizing. The actor playing the son was just as fantastic. Vulnerable and innocent, with such trust of the father, reacting to the evil in the world, but still wanting to do good. It was moving.

This was a movie that makes you think. It showed that in desperate circumstances, some will give up and choose death, some will choose evil to survive, others will choose to do no harm while surviving, and still others will risk everything to do good despite what they're up against. It was very true to life.

This film was powerful, fascinating and well done, and I recommend it.",1262390400,113,1366,4.412698412698413

8301746,5,B001FB5634,"The Road was a novel turned into a movie. The movie being released in 2009, producer John Hillcoat brought The Road to life. McCarthy wrote The Road published in 2006. The novel turned into a movie was a hit especially with actors such as Viggo Mortensen known for The Lord Of The Rings series and Charlize Theron who is also known for a role in Fate Of The Furious as Sipher. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize For Fiction along with five other awards. There were no other books from McCarthy in the movie. They also had an young and upper coming actor Kodi Smit-McPhee who played a role in X-Men Apocalypse. The plot of The Road takes place in a world of darkness. The characters have to fend for themselves. Whether that be against the elements or other people. Almost everything was the same except for way I especially viewed the characters mostly in how they appeared. I really like how the movie seemed to bring alive the realizem of how the fire looked and how it looked so destructive. Some film techniques I liked we how the sounds were perfect and how they seemed to complement the film with all the action. Along with the sounds i liked the music they played for the suspenseful scenes. I really loved how the props looked excisionally when it came to the ring and the picture of his wife Also the scene when he threw the ring off of the bridge was emotional. I really liked how they had the guns look. They looked all beat up and very old. I really like the novel but liked it more when it came out as a movie. The movie brought to life some of the things like the never ending fire that the novel didn't do. Also the movie seemed to bring more emotion than the novel brought especially in the scene when the mother is going to live and commit suicide. Overall I would highly recommend the film, the film isn't scary but its not something that won't give you a little jump. But really the film was excellent and I would watch it over and over.",1526342400,,1954,4.341530054644808

8301748,3,B001FB5634,"I just saw this movie yesterday. Awfully depressing film that did not redeem itself. These kinds of movies don't give you a positive feeling about mankind. Instead of coming together to rebuild society humans revert to savagery and cannibalism?

This guy married the wrong woman. For her to just want to give up and die shows her true character. Mortensen's character should never have married her. Her true colors were shown after she gave birth. The kid is also useless. He must have been 12-years-old yet he acted like a little baby throughout the film! He fell asleep when he should have been alert, he wanted to run after some vagrant kid he didn't know, he passed out when grabbed by a cannibal and he failed to react in time when the arrow was fired at them, thereby forcing the Father to grab him down and get shot himself. That was the end for Mortensen's character. A kid that age would be more bush savvy. And I realize this is based on the book and that would be my criticism of the book as well. Remember the girl sniper in Full Metal Jacket? Remember the kid in the 2000 Jurassic Park movie? That's what kids would be like in dangerous situations. they would adapt to survive. This kid would never have survived without his Father.

I give this film Three Stars. Great production and acting. Unfortunately the dreariness and darkness of the film coupled with the unrealistically defined kid have me give this film Three Stars. I don't recommend it. It's too dark and negative. Buy it at your own risk. I'm the 763rd person to review this film. Next for me is The Book of Eli.
