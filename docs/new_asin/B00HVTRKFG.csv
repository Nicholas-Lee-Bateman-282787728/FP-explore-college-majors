8636553,4,B00HVTRKFG,"I will write a short review because I am busily screening a lot of yoga DVDs in preparation to begin yoga. Disclosure: I am 60+, need a hip replacement, and now that I have lost 55 pounds of the 100 I was overweight, my chiropractor has recommended I do yoga for the first time in my life. I gave this 4 stars for 1) putting yoga into a global perspective and 2) informing me that yoga is newly available to women and is being adapted by women to promote not only our individual physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual strength and well-being, but to inspire us to make a difference in the world.

As a newcomer to yoga, I would have given this 5 stars if it had provided more information on the various kinds of yoga, and especially, yoga that would be most helpful to beginners who are seniors, overweight or otherwise physically, mentally, or emotionally challenged, etc. But I was glad to learn how yoga is changing lives in hospital settings, prisons, etc.

Overall, I would recommend this documentary to inspire teen and adult women to begin yoga practice feeling that we are all connected within a great worldwide movement. This would make a great gift for anyone already practicing yoga, or just beginning. Now I'll look for a how-to DVD that will meet my own needs.",1411862400,3,1277,4.5964912280701755
