4336450,4,B004ECX99Y,"Kathleen is great because she is very funny, very real, and very likable. It's the ""real"" part that differentiates her from the likes of  say Kathy Griffin or Lisa Lampanelli who, while certainly very funny, are obviously always  ""in character"" (just like so many men comedians i.e.. Gilbert  or Larry the Cable Guy, etc.)
Highly Recommended !",1299110400,3,343,4.982456140350878
4336451,5,B004ECX99Y,"I happened to catch Kathleen Madigan on Jay Leno and was amazed that I had never heard of a woman comic who is this funny.  She made me laugh out loud.  And what's really surprising is that she is not crude.  Sure, she uses some off-color words and is highly irreverent, but she doesn't talk about body fluids and some of the gross stuff that many other comics do, male and female alike.  This woman is genuinely funny without crossing the boundary into revolting.

If you happen to have grown up with or around Irish Americans, then you will find this DVD especially hilarious because you will recognize yourself and your family in her skits. The story about her parents and their computer is a laugh riot precisely because it is so familiar. And there are others that are equally on target.

This DVD is a winner for sure.",1298246400,,824,4.496644295302014
4336452,5,B004ECX99Y,"Kathleen Madigan is a very funny lady, and this one-hour sample of her work is no exception. I've been following her for several years, including her stint on ""Last Comic Standing"" where she was the only comic that no other contestant dared challenge -- they all knew she's funnier than they were. (She should have won that competition...) She's always funny, always entertaining, always fun to watch & hear and this DVD is no exception. If you know her work, you don't need my recommendation. If you don't know her work, look at a couple of snippets on YouTube and you'll know what I'm talking about.",1297987200,,601,4.679245283018868
4336453,5,B004ECX99Y,"I'll be honest . . .
I had not heard of Kathleen Madigan prior to seeing her special Gone Madigan and am not typically a ""write a review"" kinda gal.
That said, Kathleen Madigan is so absolutely hysterical that I feel compelled to share my opinion with all that will listen!
I have purchased this DVD for myself and my Irish girlfriends and will continue to follow Kathleen's performances with enthusiasm.",1297728000,,404,4.704225352112676

I will agree with Jay Leno that Kathleen Madigan is one of the funniest comics that I have ever heard.  However, I ordered this DVD for my husband and when I was looking at them I saw that one said Explicit and the other didn't show Explicit on it  so I assumed that I was getting the one that was not explicit.  My husband really didn't appreciate it because, what can I say, we are old.

I also got the MP3 download and it was not explicit and was very good.

I am disappointed because this was a present for our 51st wedding anniversary.  My husband had seen her on Jay Leno and really wanted this DVD.  I can understand all the four letter words for the young people because every other word they use is a four letter word and most of them don't show any respect for us older people who are not use to using that language and was brought up to respect our elders.

Sorry I would have loved it if it was just a regular comic dvd but I don't understand why they think they need the language to make it funny.

I think maybe you should say explicit and nonexplicit so we get what we think we ordered.

Thanks for listening to me.",1297555200,4,1307,4.738938053097345

I hadn't seen much of her lately so I looked this up on Amazon, ordered it and we watched it tonight.  The whole family got such a kick out of this DVD.  It is hysterical.  I agree with the first reviewer, she doesn't miss a beat.  I love her irreverance.  Viewing this DVD made for a very enjoyable evening.

4336456,5,B004ECX99Y,"Watched ""Gone Madigan"" on Showtime this morning and Kathleen Madigan is absolutely a SCREAM!!! Is she politically incorrect? Of Course!! Is she crude and vulgar? No!!.. Coming from a large Irish Catholic family from St Louis,Missouri.. I found her observations and dry humor to be refreshing. Yes...she is irreverent... and takes on everything from California healthy living..Wee people in Ireland ... her parents and siblings.. a tour of the Mormon temple... she hits such a variety of topics but didn't miss a beat on any of them. Beware ... she is a democrat and she does think.. so if you find either of those threatening or offensive this is not your cup of tea. Otherwise... get ready for a very entertaining stand-up set with a very intelligent lady who has just a little different twist on life!!!

She's not always PC, and her language can get a bit rough, so I'd be cautious about letting the kids hear it, but really.  She hits politicians, religions, and people in general and makes it clear how ridiculous life can really be.

I don't know if this is how they intend to package all their DVD's, but this one looked like someone made it in their own home, as cheaply as possible.  It has a single-sided piece of paper for the cover, apparently cut out by someone since the sides weren't exactly all square. The rest of the jewel case is void of any paper or design. The CD is a plain gray one, with her autograph on it.  But I wouldn't judge a DVD by its cover.

The only problem with comedy DVD's is that once you have watched it and heard the jokes, they aren't quite as funny the second time around (or third, fourth etc.) so it loses its value quickly, and is relegated to collecting dust on the shelf after one or maybe two viewings.",1360195200,,890,4.311377245508982
4336520,3,B004ECX99Y,"Gone Madigan is an hour stand-up routine from Kathleen Madigan.  I thought she was pretty funny, but her language can be a little salty.  She doesn't really break any new ground (politics, health decisions, etc.), and she doesn't really have anything in her style that sets her apart - by comparison think of Jim Gaffigan's ""inner monologue"".  I'm not sure if this is something that I will watch over and over, but it is worth a single viewing.  Happy viewing.",1359504000,,460,4.7125
4336521,3,B004ECX99Y,"Lewis Black calls Kathleen Madigan his BFF and ""the funniest comic in America, bar none."" Mr. Black may be less than objective; while Madigan is indeed funny, she is in fact nowhere near the funniest. This hour-long show, taped in 2009, takes the viewer through constantly changing topics which she navigates with relatively smooth transitions.

After a brief initial bit about her imaginary illnesses, she performs a really funny routine on the USO tour of Afghanistan and Bosnia that she took with fellow comedian Black and singers Kid Rock and Kellie Pickler, who is apparently just as dumb as she seems in interviews. Madigan's best crack about Afghanistan is her response to friends who ask her how much money it will cost to fix that benighted nation: ""How much money would it cost to fix the moon?""

Quick, amusing riffs on Detroit, the National Guard, bickering parents, Hilary Clinton, and Barack Obama come to a crashing halt when Madigan does an unabashedly racist routine about the Chinese, complete with a poor imitation of an accent. Since she's from Missouri, though, I don't suppose I should be surprised (I said that in a St. Louis accent, which you can't hear, but trust me, it was hilarious).

Madigan's use of accents, occasionally a strength, is at times a failing, as when she augments a bit on getting a sketchy home loan from WaMu with a supposedly Filipino accent that doesn't come within 5,000 miles of the Philippines. If you're going to mock other nationalities, you have to get this right or you come across as an ignorant bigot. Her liberal use of profanity and her choice of transient or outdated subjects like the Underwear Bomber don't bother me nearly as much as this casual racism.

Fortunately, Madigan gets back on track with riotous routines about Catholics and Mormons, and with a funny solution to both health care costs and terrorism: ""Why not, at the airport, send everyone through a CAT scan?"" She riffs on banks and Oprah Winfrey, her passion for Taco Bell, and her contempt for Sarah Palin and Tea Party women who claim they want what the Founding Fathers wanted: ""Well, ladies, they didn't want to let us vote, so you might want to reread the brochure of the team you just signed up with.""

After cycling through old news like Paula Abdul, Katie Couric, Michael Jackson, Tiger Woods, and Suze Orman, Madigan gets to her strongest material: her Irish-American family, and especially her father, a cynical lawyer who is clearly one of the primary sources of her mordant worldview. She cracks wise about where her parents live - the Ozarks - and about computers, which her folks are always finding new ways to break.

Madigan wraps up with a variety of very witty bits on vegetarians in Los Angeles (who tell her God didn't mean for us to eat cows, to which she responds, ""Then I think he shoulda made `em harder to catch. You don't see anybody eating cheetah burgers, do ya?""), elderly women in Las Vegas (for which she produces some hilarious voices), Indian casinos in Minnesota (where she indulges in her favorite vices: gambling, drinking, and smoking), and gay marriage (but she really wants to see someone marry a goat).

I enjoyed this program despite its flaws, but it really doesn't rival the very best of stand-up comedy.",1357344000,3,3275,4.816725978647687

4336524,5,B004ECX99Y,"I'm not usually a big fan of stand-up comedy.  My husband happened to see Kathleen Madigan on HBO and said ""You've got to watch this!  She's hilarious!""  So, I sat down and figured I'd watch a little and then excuse myself, but I sat through the entire performance and laughed my you-know-what off.  Madigan is one of the funniest and sharpest observer of people I've ever come across.  She's definitely got a potty mouth, so be warned, (some comedians can be foul-mouthed AND funny; others turn me off) and some of her humor would probably qualify as politically incorrect, but it really hit my funny bone.  My husband and I quote her to each other because we've watched this video so many times.  I would love to see Madigan live some day, but for now, I have my video to enjoy.  Check it out.  I don't know if it's for everyone, but I love it.",1353283200,,846,4.406451612903226

4336530,4,B004ECX99Y,"Having heard a lot of Kathleen's material on XM Radio in our vehicle, I was familiar with her type of humor.  This was a continuation of it with a lot more political satire than what you hear on the radio, but very funny and entertaining none the less.  Having been excited about hearing her in person and then her concert being cancelled, I was looking forward to seeing her on video at least as to how she interacts with an audience.

I'd recommend her dvd to anybody who has never been to her concerts or seen her dvds.",1329955200,,522,4.3061224489795915

You can find someone that makes you chuckle but I had tears coming out of eyes watching this lady.  She is extremely mid western but you don't have to be to appreciate her humor.  There is some language that could be offensive to some, but even that isn't too bad.  She is hilarious. A very good buy!",1321574400,,446,4.390243902439025

4336543,2,B004ECX99Y,"If you like cursing, and the ""F Bomb"" you can enjoy this. Frankly, I see nothing comical about including cursing in comedy. There are funnier comedians than Kathleen Madigan who never use a curse word. I am no saint, and I can use expletives, but if I were a comedienne, I wouldn't use the disgusting expletives (publicly) that Kathleen uses. It's as if you are telling the world, ""I have very few morals, and I want  the public know...I am proud of that.""  It's as if the comedians like Kathleen  think that the  more they use expletives the funnier they are...NOT so!

Two very funny, and clean, comedians are Brian Regan, and Henry Cho.

I am sure I am going to get a lot of mail admonishing me. Please save your time. Thanks!",1302912000,7,729,4.443609022556391

It was an absolute pleasure to finally see facial expressions and gestures during pauses.  She uses her family and friends in her show and makes you laugh at them and with them.  For me these times were the funniest moments in her routine.

You may not laugh through the whole show, but you will most definitely find something that makes you cry tears of joy and something that you'll want to share with your co-workers the next day.",1300752000,2,521,4.395833333333333

She is witty, dry, sarcastic(that's why I like her)and she doesn't try to be a character. She is just Kathleen Madigan. More than once I laughed out loud at her take on everyday american stupidity. A lot of comics I see don't even make me chuckle, male or female. I'm glad I got this dvd, I hadn't seen Kathleen in awhile, it was nice to catch up on her career.",1299715200,,471,4.130434782608695

Granted, it was filmed back when Obama took office but when I need a good laugh, much of what she jokes about is timeless and will have you in stitches.  Especially when she talks about her USO tours and her Mom and Dad.  Wish she would have a more recent filmed show.  I also purchased Madigan Again but haven't watched it yet.  Hope its as funny as ""Gone Madigan"".  Kathleen, if you're out there, give us another filmed show please!",1486598400,,461,4.364705882352941
