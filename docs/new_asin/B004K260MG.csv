8432121,5,B004K260MG,This is Brittains Hogan's Heroes only much funnier. Once again the Nazi's are as dumb as a box pf rocks and the Gestapo are the dumbest of all.  At times I laughed so hard I ended up in coughing fits.,1514678400,,200,4.0
8432122,5,B004K260MG,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media. This particular set contains series one through series six. Each containing approximately eight episodes:

""The British are Coming"" starts the series and explains many things that happen later in the series.

""The Fallen Madonna"" with the big whatever, will set a reoccurring theme as Colonel Kurk von Strom has pilfered the painting for his retirement. Keep your eye on it through the series as it becomes a shell game.

The basic story is that of a caf owner Ren; this is in France during the WWII German occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law. Throw in some downed British airmen and some onion soup.
I will not go though each series in detail because for those that have not seen it or if it has been while since viewing the series, the surprise factor and the one liners are worth discovering first hand.

I will say that the highlight for me in the first series was when they mistakenly fed grain laced with nitro glycerin to the chickens.

One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.

8432124,1,B004K260MG,"Ordered THIS set in red/blue box, 16 CDs, NEW DISCS. . SIX of them would not play through, kept freezing up. Dealer sent me replacement and allowed me to hold onto first set to increase chances of getting 16 good discs. Replacement arrived, started to play the new copies of faulty discs. Of the 4 I played, THREE were defective!!. At that point, I just gave up and returned all of them.  The series itself is hilarious! My review refers only to THIS version. Beware.",1507680000,,467,4.4941176470588236
