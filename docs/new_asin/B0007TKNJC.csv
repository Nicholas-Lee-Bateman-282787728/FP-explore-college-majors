Informative video that's not scary at all. He LOVES the songs. We adults think it's hilarious on many levels.",1365120000,,289,4.433962264150943
8051833,5,B0007TKNJC,"My 20 month old son just loves this video. (His daddy is a firefighter.) He would watch it every morning if I let him. We checked it out on Netflix and it's a good thing they don't have late fees, we've kept it so long! Looks like I need to purchase one for him to keep. It's simple, cute, very entertaining (for young kids for sure, and I think it would be for older kids too), and educational. Gives kids a sneak peek into what firefighters and their equipment do, and also gives some fire safety tips for kids too. Cute songs, nice video footage of fire apparatus in action.",1314748800,,577,4.254545454545455
8051834,5,B0007TKNJC,"If your kids are into firefighting this movie will knock their socks off. Even my 2 year old daughter loves it. It is so kid friendly, yet full of everything exciting about fire.",1250208000,,178,4.424242424242424
8051835,5,B0007TKNJC,"I checked this video out from our local library for my 2 1/2 year old son & repeatedly re-checked it out due his extreme enjoyment of the video.  The video does a wonderful job at educating him on fighting fires.  I finally decided to take back the library's copy of the video, and purchase our own.  We're sure to get our money's worth!!",1127606400,,338,4.333333333333333
