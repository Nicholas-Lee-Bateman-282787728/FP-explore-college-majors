6432650,4,B00KITEH2U,"To address some of Zimmermans review here Ill say this - Yes the film was shot in 2011 and didn't make the store shelves until 2014. Does that make it a low quality movie? Not necessarily, not if its truly an independent film and grossly under financed. The fact that it finally DID get a release speaks volumes for the faith the distributor has in it!  A lot of INDIs spend time with foreign distribution first before making their appearance here in the States. As far as being cliche laden, I would ask what crime drama today isn't and also point out that there are some very different approaches the screenwriters took in avoiding typical situations, Jesses family life being a case in point which includes, among other humorous scenes, her very funny mother who at one point threatens to shoot her own little dog if Jesse doesnt stop arguing with her brother - one of many unexpected surprises that crop up in this film.

While its true that Armand Assante only appears in one scene, thats a scene you wouldnt want to miss. Assantes interaction with actor Paul Vario is fiery and memorable, oh and by the way, only two f-bombs in that scene - lol. (if you're sitting there counting f-bombs youd better stay away from R-rated films.)

It was an extra treat to see Eric Roberts here as Jesses love interest, who manages to impress Jesse with his sincere interest in her problems, while other potential suiters earlier in the film fail miserably.

William Forsythe pulls out all the stops for this film. From his calm and suave approach to doing business, to his enraged attack on arch villain Ralph, played by actor Anthony Trentacosta, Forsythe is a real pleasure to watch!

Michael Wright can do no wrong in my book. Ive always been a fan of his work for many years, and his mere presence here only adds to the legitimacy of the film. Hes a genius, period.

As far as the unknown actors, which include some who I recognized from the TV series OZ, ALL did amazing jobs. I didn't get the impression, even for a moment, that any of them fell out of character. Very strong performances which makes one wonder why we haven't seen some of these actors before now. Ill be keeping an eye out for them in the future!

I enjoyed this movie. Its got great characters and an interesting story. Jesse isn't just your typical shoot em up crime drama. Theres a lot of off beat humorous stuff going on throughout, yet it maintains an engaging story line which weaves its way to a surprising climatic conclusion.  I highly recommend checking out this movie!",1410307200,3,2544,4.5881057268722465
6432651,1,B00KITEH2U,One of the worst I've ever seen. Like a 9th grade middle school drama queen directed it using actors with no experience.,1410048000,,120,4.5
6432652,1,B00KITEH2U,"If you want a slew of ""F"" words and nothing but foul mouthed dialogue which does NOTHING for the story line then this movie is for you. I hated it. I counted 79 F words in the first 7 minutes of the movie. I stopped it there as there was no story but f this and f that and f you and i f'ing don't know. Don't waste your money on what could have been a good movie but only cared about a competition of how many f words they could stuff into a movie.",1409443200,4,448,3.7263157894736842

6432654,1,B00KITEH2U,"That was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The lead actress was terrible. I cannot believe Eric Roberts, Armand Assante and William Forsythe were in this. Waste of money. Terrible acting, except for the three short appearances of the names I mentioned.",1408492800,,268,4.723404255319149
6432655,5,B00KITEH2U,"Jesse is a great noir style thriller starring former diva Stephanie Finochio as a good cop turned vigilante--yes I know it's been done before but this is fresh, fun and Steph is hot! She has all the right moves! Aided and abetted by Armand Assante(I the Jury),Eric Roberts(Expendables), and William Forsyte(Untouchables) it's a great ride by director Fred Carpenter(Murdered Innocence) Fred is the Roger Corman of Long Island!!!",1408492800,2,428,5.3088235294117645
6432656,1,B00KITEH2U,If I could go zero I would. This movie feels like it was a high school project. The acting is horrid. The plot would not be bad if the quality would be better and the dialog was done well.,1408406400,,188,3.8461538461538463
6432657,5,B00KITEH2U,"I saw this film at it's premier in New York and was very impressed. It was shot locally and the star (Jesse) Stephanie Finochio, is from Long Island. The movie is well written and suspenseful and the actors are great!",1403654400,7,217,4.45
8659355,1,B00KITEH2U,"This must have been a very low budget movie. The first scene panned across a street corner and was visibly jerky, the dialogue was terrible and the closeups were awful. I lasted about 3 minutes. It was too difficult to watch. I wish I could get my rental fee back.",1496534400,,264,4.3

8659359,1,B00KITEH2U,"Not good at all.  The only entertaining character is the mom.  Eric Roberts plays a fair role, but the story is ridiculous and the ""star"" should go back to wrestling gators or whatever she did before this.",1428883200,,205,4.513513513513513

8659362,3,B00KITEH2U,NOT a superb movie. Unconventional. Tongue in cheek. Ms Finochio is a pleasant looking young woman. Her acting is so acted that it is funny.  I enjoyed it.,1413676800,,155,4.535714285714286
8659363,4,B00KITEH2U,"I would have to agree with actor Michael Wright who was at the premier at the SOHO International Film Festival when he spoke after the film describing that what director Fred Carpenter did with only one camera and a shoe-string budget was nothing short of amazing.  OK this may not be Gone With The Wind, but there's a tremendous amount of fresh talent along with veteran actors, Assante, Forsythe, Roberts, and Wright, and that makes this unique film a worthy investment.",1411344000,,472,4.827160493827161
