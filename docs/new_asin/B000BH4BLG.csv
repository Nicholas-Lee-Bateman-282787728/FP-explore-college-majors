2417056,3,B000BH4BLG,"Some good basic ideas to dancing for your man, but if you have no inhibitions, this video is not for you.  The moves were simple, alot of the tips were common sense.  The cd was not good at all in my opinion, due to the lyrics.  Who wants to strip for their man while a man is rapping about seeing naked girls at a strip club?  Yes, the name of the song is ""Naked Girls"".  Hokey at best as far the lyrics, the music would be better without them.  The girls who give tips and sample dances were real, down to earth.  Unfortunately, some of the tips from each one overlapped each other.  I was desperately trying to suprise my husband for valentines and needed some ideas.  I would buy used, don't pay more than $15-20.",1141948800,9,717,4.213235294117647
2417077,1,B000BH4BLG,"Don't buy this dvd. All the dancers are horrific. They don't show you how to really stip tease effectively. Anyone can do everything they do and more without any lessons. It is a home video. This is just a warning, we were very displeased with this product.",1192406400,5,257,4.48936170212766
2417078,4,B000BH4BLG,"this is a good idea if you have no clue on how to give a lap dance.they give you basic instructions so you can catch on easiy.i learned some moves. the instrumental CD was a great bonus.
only problem is it only playes in my lap top computer.",1192320000,3,241,4.041666666666667
2417079,4,B000BH4BLG,"Well, what I can say about this purchase was okay.
It was my first time purchase of this type of DVD.  I think that this DVD will be more suitable for ladies who are beginner for striptease or ladies who are willing to learn how to do striptease as basic.  I mean, if I were beginner myself I would love this DVD and earn something from here.  But it was little bit different from what I was expected.  What you see from DVD are 4 Caucasian ladies instructing their ways and you can either choose which striptease you might be interested in or learn... plus, the way they instruct are classy not nasty striptease like you see at the club.  If you are looking for something concentrate on the striptease with your booty or your moves with your booty, you might not be interested in this DVD.  I was expected to learn the striptease with more on booty work but for type of person like myself, this DVD is NEEEEEEEEEXT!!  Please do not get me wrong, this DVD is not bad and yes, you can learn how to dance and basic tease moves from this one if you want to learn step by step about basic strip tease.",1187827200,4,1097,4.2451923076923075
2417080,1,B000BH4BLG,"This was HORRIBLE.  I wish I could give it a negative rating.

I actually paid a little more for this because the overall star rating was good and some of the reviews really played it up, but I must have somehow read the reviews in the wrong order because I didn't notice the bad reviews.

It was slow paced and there was too much talking.  These girls just wouldn't shut up.  And the music was really awful-but they kept re-using it anyway.",1185408000,6,441,4.329268292682927
2417081,1,B000BH4BLG,"This was very slow moving and didn't teach me anything.  Just women wiggling to slow music.  It didn't seem to be real dancers trying to teach anything new or different at all.  No rhythm, no excitement, no dancing as such.  Even my husband was bored.  I've done some very basic classes and have seen housewives more inspiring.  This will go into our next yard sale.",1184544000,6,366,4.553846153846154
2417082,2,B000BH4BLG,"This DVD is basically a summary of all the moves you would do with your common sense, without needing to buy this DVD. There isn't much step to step moves or any real routines to do, just a lot of obvious tips and tricks. Some of the moves the women do are unflattering or too corny for their body type, or maybe they just aren't doing it right, but something doesn't look right (reminds me of a low class strip club). I have seen much sexier and classier shows than this. Out of the 3 DVDs I purchased, this one was trash.

Though, on the good side, I did like Fawnia's short clips because it did show an interesting and TASTEFUL way to remove your shoes and bottoms. I'm a young woman and I feel that this would be very unsatisfactory to other young women (because most young women have been to a club before and know how to dance), but for older women this may or may not be useful. It is interesting to see how 4 different women dance.

Now for the Music CD that comes with the DVD: 74 minutes of stripping music. Some of them I found to be useful. Most of them are slow, but nice. For my personal taste, though, I would have preferred something much bolder for stronger movements.",1183939200,5,1185,4.238938053097345
2417083,3,B000BH4BLG,"This dvd contains just the basics of lap dancing. What to wear or not wear. Real women, in different heights & weights, no plastic breasts, but all white, no ethnic women (I'm white & I'm offended by that). Shot in people's living rooms, low-budget home-movie feel with somewhat decent lighting & only ok camera angles. If the content is great, I don't mind that, but I didn't learn anything here.
The moves are VERY elementary, but are MAYBE good for those who are shy & blank out on an attempt to dance sexy. This is not for anyone who already knows how to belly, latin or hula dance decently or do hip hop or even yoga. A man seeing those dances would turn him on more then the few moves this dvd teaches.
It contains the intro of 4 women, 2 sections of dance teaching & 1 demo. The teaching is always split in 2 sections & is about 15-20 min long with a lot of ""Uumm... well you can.. ummmmm......"" It's not scripted which is refreshing, but it doesn't even seem like the ""dancers"" made a planned outline idea of what they want to teach. The teaching could have easily been half the time or less. I FFW most of it. The demo dance is about 3-6 min (which was very repetitious & boring).
The music is boring, but that isn't that important as it's about learning to dance, but the music won't save bad content. The first one with Nicole was decent, but I think it's because she uses her lover? & lets HIM TOUCH her wherever he wants & there is a lot of sexual tension. The others all made me yawn & probably would for most guys.
For you men looking at this, you'll find no nudity.

You can see a preview at their site striptoit com
On the pics of the dancers, I recognize Nicole, & Cleo, Fawnia, there was a heavyset blond women in her 30s? & a young, short, petite, cute, girl next door girl.",1183593600,11,1794,4.245614035087719
2417084,1,B000BH4BLG,I was quite disappointed with this dvd.  The girls' styles were not up to date.. the stuff they wear and their hairstyles are quite old fashioned.. then i looked at the production date and it was from 2005..but still.. and there weren't any WOW techniques.. i didn't learn anything.. NOTHING at all..,1179360000,5,300,4.769230769230769
2417085,5,B000BH4BLG,"I purchased this to learn how to give my husband of 11 years, a lap dance...(I'm a novice dancer!) WOW!!!! this dvd was the extra push I needed. It taught me the moves I wanted to have and the music was good too. The only part I did not like was the interview and demo by Fawnia Mondey. She's built like a body builder and does what looks like a gymnastics floor show for her demo dance...The other girls were great...I will never forget the smile on my man's face when he was watching me dance for him! He even asked if I was really ""shopping"" with my friends and not going to strip clubs!!!!!",1176163200,5,594,4.173913043478261
2417086,5,B000BH4BLG,"This DVD is geared towards the ""average"" woman who is a beginner and wants to learn how to do a lap dance and striptease.  Four dancers do a short talking section, discussing several tips and techniques for setting the mood, what to wear, etc., then they describe and walk you through several different moves (sometimes with a couch and sometimes with a chair), and then they put it all together in a demonstration dance to music.  As an added bonus, there is a link to the customer's area of the web site where you can sign up for free and get access to additional downloadable music and videos.

If you are a professional dancer looking to pick up some advanced moves, this probably isn't for you, although you still may find it helpful.  No supermodels on expensive film stages, which makes this more real for the majority of the women who might buy the DVD.  The setting is similar to what you would find in most home living rooms... no fancy poles or sexy colored stage lighting.  The video was not meant to be erotic on its own, it's purely instructional in nature.  Plus it comes with a bonus music CD that holds it own, and is enjoyable to listen to even when you aren't dancing.

If you aren't certain that this is for you, there are demo video clips and music clips on the product web site.  They will give you a good feel for the product and help you decide.  Don't base your decisions solely on customer reviews, as everyone is different, and most people don't take the time to write a review.",1175126400,14,1505,4.44
2417097,2,B000BH4BLG,I enjoyed the music but the move shwn were boring and predictable. i guess it is a great tool for a novice.,1172102400,3,107,3.909090909090909
2417098,3,B000BH4BLG,"When I got the DVD, we put it on and watch how well some of the girls on the DVD did their dances. We both now know what to expect from a strip tease.",1170028800,2,150,3.4411764705882355
2417099,1,B000BH4BLG,"If you are looking to learn ANYTHING about lapdancing or floor work.... this is NOT the dvd for you.  First off... I want to say that this dvd did not play in my dvd player and it is a new dvd-rw player.  I could only watch it on my computer.  The sound was turned up as loud as it would go and I could barely hear what they were saying, even after I put on my headphones!  It features 4 women who do alot of talking and very little showing. It teaches you how to take your shoes off...  COME ON! Do we really need help with that? I have seen better dancing at a high school prom. The demo dancing is completely useless and boring and the women have no skills.  I am really disappointed in this dvd...  Especially since it is $28!  What a waste of good money.",1156723200,7,759,4.013333333333334
2417100,5,B000BH4BLG,"I've always wanted to do something a bit different and special for my husband, but just lacked the little extra confidence needed to give it a try.  This video gave me more than enough ideas and helpful hints to ease my worries and give me the little push I needed to go ahead and try a strip tease and lap dance for him.  All I can say is that I'm really glad I did!!  Things have been a lot more fun since then!",1154476800,11,413,3.9518072289156625
2417101,5,B000BH4BLG,"I liked this DVD because it provided simple and easy dance moves, presented by real people.  No Playboy supermodels paid big bucks to present this DVD, and no fancy soundstages and expensive sets.  Just good practical advice and dance moves by real dancers, but presented in a way that the ""average"" woman, like me, could relate to.

There were a few different styles of music on the included CD, so it was easy for me to find something I liked.

My husband loved the show, and we had a great evening!  Well worth the money!",1150502400,16,524,4.473684210526316
2417102,5,B000BH4BLG,"A lot of women complain that their man goes to the strip club, but then a lot of women are too shy to get a little freaky for their man. What man doesn't want his own private dancer?

It's all about the tease ladies! We all want what we can't have, and if you build up that anticipation, then the desire goes through the roof!

This DVD shows you how to do just that. It also comes with a CD to get sexy to.

I got this one for my girlfriend and I'll be honest, at first she looked at me funny. But we watched it together once, just so I could show her that it WASN'T a porno (even the DVD is a tease!) and then she watched it on her own to learn the moves. Let me tell you: I came home from work a few days later and that shy little office assistant went wild! She RIPPED my shirt off and THREW me on the couch. Then she gave me the best private dance of my life! That must have empowered her or something, because now she even WALKS sexier. And her whole undergarment selection went from ""yawn"" to ""let's get it on."" It's amazing what can happen when you let loose a little bit!

So if you want to be a professional stripper, then no, this DVD doesn't teach you how to catch dollar bills in your g-string or hang from a stipper pole. But it can turn a ""good"" girl naughty, and ladies, it WILL put a smile on your man's face! Trust me! Your man won't need ""herbal performance enhancement"" when you put these moves into practice, because it's all in the hips!

Allright, well my girlfiend's birthday is coming up, so I better go get her some new Victoria Secret or something. Hopefully another video is coming out soon?",1149033600,36,1619,4.110759493670886
2417103,5,B000BH4BLG,My girl picked this up to give me a little suprise. This is the dopest concept. Thank you for making this!,1148428800,17,106,4.095238095238095
2417104,5,B000BH4BLG,"This was just what I was looking for to help me put together a fun night for my husband and me.  The DVD presented simple dance moves that were easy to learn, along with many other helpful tips that made me feel a lot more comfortable before my show.  I liked that it wasn't a slick MTV-style production... the women looked like regular women and the location looked like it could be anyone's home (which is where most of the women who buy this would be doing their show).  The music CD was a great bonus, making the package a better value compared to some others that I considered.",1147996800,14,582,4.321100917431193
2417105,5,B000BH4BLG,"I'm a little shy about this kind of thing, and the Strip To It Bump N' Grind DVD really taught me what I needed to give my husband a big surprise that he never expected!  It was a great night and definitely worth the price for me!

The women in the video were non-intimidating, and it was done simply and tastefully in what looked like a typical home living room.  Dance moves were shown both with a couch and with a chair, and with four different dancers, so there was more than enough material for me to figure out what I needed to do.  The women also gave some great tips and advice on what to do, and what not to do, that helped to make me feel a lot more comfortable when I did my show.

I thought the inclusion of a music CD was great!  There are four non-stop sets of music in different styles so you can pick the type of music you want to dance to.  I liked the slow RnB song set that had vocals, and the instrumental set is very nice for relaxing or just background mood music.  My favorite song on the whole CD, though, is one of the upbeat dance songs called ""Come Closer"".  I didn't use that to dance to, but I really love listening to that song!

If your are looking for a sexy video to watch, this is not it.  But, if you are a bit shy or conservative, and have never done a striptease or lap dance before (like me), then this instructional video and CD is definitely worth considering.",1145750400,31,1400,4.110294117647059
2417106,1,B000BH4BLG,This is one of the worst dvds Ive ever purchased. I should have spent my 20 on a lapdance at a club I would have learned more. The music is cheesy and low budget and the video is trashy not sexy.,1145404800,3,195,3.7804878048780486

8086660,1,B000BH4BLG,"Don't waste your money on this. I bought it to learn a dance but it was more something to laugh at. The video quality is cheap, the dances are corny and unimpressive. Learned so much more from Carmen Electras strip aerobics.",1357516800,,224,4.487804878048781
8086661,4,B000BH4BLG,This is a great beginner's DVD if you want to learn a few things about strip teasing.  It also has a great CD of music to strip to that doesn't have pausing between the music.  The video is like a one-time viewing though....it's not like a workout or anything that you can watch and dance along to every day. It's basically instructional but great at the same time.,1270771200,2,365,4.352941176470588
8086662,2,B000BH4BLG,"As noted by other reviewers, the quality of the DVD is lacking. Having read the reviews prior to purchasing the DVD, I expected that and was not disappointed. I do not consider myself to be a good dancer but I can find the beat and shimmy a bit. With that, I was very disappointed in the dance material itself. The instructors gave no more education then what I could have learned watching the basic striptease scene off of my favorite rated R movie.",1265846400,,450,4.433734939759036
8086663,1,B000BH4BLG,"I was looking for a more professional workout video. I was very disappointed with this DVD because it looks homemade and is extremely dull.

The women looked like average women, which was very nice.  This is not sleezy, it is strictly educational.  The dvd also comes with a great cd with music to strip by.  I would highly recomment this.  Buy it and surprise your husband.",1204329600,,355,4.369230769230769
8086666,1,B000BH4BLG,"This dvd was so trashy, and amateur.  Two of the women dancing on the guys totally grossed me out.  It was really sleezy.  I would never purchase this or recomend it to anyone.  Absolutely terrible.",1203897600,2,198,4.571428571428571
