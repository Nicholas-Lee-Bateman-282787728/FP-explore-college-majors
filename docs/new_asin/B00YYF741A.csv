7269379,4,B00YYF741A,"""Felix and Meira"" (2014 release from Canada; 105 min.) brings the story of the two title characters. As the movie opens, we see Meira serving dinner to a group of Hasadic Jewish couples. Not a word is said during dinner, and you can immediately sense a sadness within Meira. It's only later that we understand she is bored and frustrated and suffocating under the tight-knit rules of the Hasadic Jewish community. Then we get to know Felix, a secular Jew whose father is dying. Felix and his dad were not close but it still affects Felix significantly. One day, Felix runs into Meira and her 3 yr. old baby girl at the local coffee shop. He tries to strike up a conversation but she rejects him. Later on, though, it becomes clear that something is brewing between Felix and Meira. At this point we're about 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the third full-length feature from Canadian writer-director Maxime Giroux. This time he tackles a story line that plays out in the closed community that is the Hasadic Jewish Community. The 2012 ""Fill The Voice"" film explored similar themes as to the isolated Hasadic Jewish community, but here Giroux decides to make it even more personal by focusing on Meira and her conflicted feelings as to her overall life. In the beginning of the movie, Meira 'plays dead' to tease her husband. Much later on, when her husband asks why she doesn't do that anymore, Meira wistfully replies ""Who says I'm not dead already?"", wow. (And her husband's response to that? ""When will you finally understand that this is our life? Pull yourself together!"") It should be noted that, even though the closeness/isolationism of the Hasadic Jewish community can be an easy target for criticism, the movie treats them at all times with a great amount of respect. The acting performances are top-notch all the way, in fact I was wondering whether the Hasadic Jews were portrayed by actors or by real Hasadic Jews. Hadas Yaron as Meira is outstanding (she also played the role of a Hasadic Jewish wife in ""Fill the Void"", by the way.) Compared to that, Martin Dubreuil as Felix has a harder time staying in the lime light. Last but not least, there is an outstanding clarinet-heavy musical score (composed to Olivier Alary), and even fellow Canadian Leonard Cohen contributes a tune (""Famous Blue Raincoat""). Bottom line: this is a slow-moving (in the best possible way) family drama set within the Hasadic Jewish community that caught my attention from start to finish.

""Felix and Meira"" opened without any pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati over the recent Memorial Day weekend. The matinee screening where I saw this at was very nicely attended, somewhat to my surprise to be honest (the audience was heavy on the seniors, I might add). If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is GALAXIES away from the latest Mad Max or Pitch Perfect and will likely move you emotionally, do yourself a favor and check this out, be it in the theater, or eventually on VOD or DVD/Blu-ray. ""Felix and Meira"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1434672000,11,3241,4.775401069518717

But usually the producers at least pretend to have some sort of semblance of balance. In this film they didn't even try. It was almost like watching a switch being turned on and off.

I am sure this situation occurs and there are very few choices for those that are not able to blend in completely. The situation, shown by the stark cinematography, is very black and white. Does Mira leave and go away with Flix because he is her only means of escape or does she feel deep love for him?

The main protagonists are played by actors whose talents are best displayed in several moving scenes, in particular the gentle removal of the wig from the Hasidic woman by her lover. The sound tract is a perfect: Thorpe, L. Cohen. As we go along the unfolding intangelment, it becomes clear that despite everyone's effort to make the ""best"" choice, freely, the future is less than certain and probably the first choice will be followed by many other choices probably as difficult. Is it because the  director is Canadian, but I found an European - if not French - touch in many scenes that I particularly enjoyed?",1471392000,2,749,4.992

(spoiler alert:  I loved the ending, after Miera left her husband, and he was all alone, he played the ""modern"" music he previously had chastised her for listening to, and he laid on the floor, like she used to do.

I wish I knew more about the Hassidic culture though.  I wonder what the meaning was of why the women had their hair cut so short, only to wear fashionable wigs, and why the men poured water over their hands into a basin before they got out of bed in the morning.  But I imagine that the Hassidic culture looking at us, would wonder why we do what appears strange to them.",1461715200,3,854,4.407643312101911

7269402,2,B00YYF741A,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Felix & Meira is the monotonous story of a dreary Meira, stuck in an Orthodox Judaism marriage. She meets the equally dreary Flix, who hasn't spoken to his father in ten years and appears magically at his deathbed. He scores some money at the inheritance, thanks to his equally dreary sister. One day he meets Meira and thus starts the dreary ""love"".

The premise itself is so absurd, yet the execution is even more unbelievable. Soon the husband finds out and pushes the Felix away, but he can't stop this ""love"". He follows her and yearns for her. Both of them are drudgingly boring people, so they attract.

One unintentionally hilarious scene has Felix in the garb dress of an Orthodox Jew, complete with a beard and curls. I guess the local magic shop has some great Jewish outfits and he can just walk into some Jewish Tabernacle without being noticed by the locals. I thought I was watching some spy flick.

The ending didn't clarify anything at all, and it was all so pointless and contrived.",1459382400,2,1042,4.646739130434782

Her husband is emotionally removed and more worried about what others will think than about her well being.  It is set in a Hasidic community in Montreal, but it isn't really about this particular community.  The male lead Felix is also depressed.  He has lost his estranged father without having had the opportunity to reconcile with him before his death.  He is total driftless; she is totally moored to her community.  Opposites attract, of course.  I liked that the film wasn't a diatribe against Orthodox Judaism, and the female lead was well acted.

Instead of predictable characters (particularly the husband, who is nothing like the rigid fanatic you may be expecting) we get individuals of great emotional depth faced with wrenching choices whose consequences they can't foresee. The filmmaker is especially attuned to the role, among the Hasidim, not just of faith but of belonging. Seen from this perspective the modern secular world looks terrifying indeed.

I do not know any of these characters' history. Was Meira brought up Orthodox? Is she depressed because the Orthodox customs are so restrictive, she doesn't want to be a mother, wants a job, wants to ""express herself"", wants good sex, or just because her husband is a jerk? Where is the chemistry that makes her and Felix fall in love? Or is the only appeal ""he is someone else beside Husband"" (I don't remember his name.) I felt zero identification with these dull characters. About the only interesting moment in this movie is when Husband tries to bitch-slap Felix and later they share a drink.

7269471,2,B00YYF741A,"Just watched Felix and Meira on Amazon Prime. F&eacute;lix and Meira is disappointing. There is no real plot there outside of a Haredi wife becoming estranged from her husband and community and leaving them. The context is almost completely absent. Why was she unhappy? what was her relationship with her Hasidic husband? What exactly was the source of attraction between her and felix?
I noticed that Shulem (played by Luzer Twersky) never asks her the simple question: What do you find attractive about him? What are you unhappy about in your current life? At the end, when he implores Felix to keep her ""Safe and sound"" if she does wind up leaving her, we are left wondering: why indeed does he care? (It's not like a typical hasid in that spot would...)",1445472000,5,757,4.742424242424242

Plotline is interesting enough, but could be further explored. Characters, especially the hasidic husband, are decidedly one-dimensional and perhaps the actors are not skilled enough to show more. The actor who played Felix wasn't bad, but he was missing a supporting cast .",1444176000,,401,5.28125

7269477,4,B00YYF741A,"An excellent film, powerful and moving, about the painful liberation of a woman from an ultra-Orthodox Jewish marriage.  What is lovely about the film is that no one is portrayed as ""the bad person.""  They are all searching for their own version of happiness.  Wonderful acting, especially from the actor portraying the Orthodox husband---very nuanced and sensitive. The very last scene is a lovely visual metaphor for opening the world to wondering eyes.",1440633600,4,455,5.205479452054795

8719333,5,B00YYF741A,"This movie was striking in it's simplicity yet extremely powerful. It was captivating to see Meira in her world as a Hasidic wife. The story line briefly captured the nuances and the challenges of living in such a restrictive world. The movie seemed to provide a looking glass into a secret culture which I found fascinating. Meira is trapped and you see her pain as she goes through the paces of her everyday life. You are almost happy for her when she meets Felix. He is funny and charming and finds a way to get Meira to smile and relax. You feel her childlike wonder at the outside world. One of my favorite scenes was in the Latin bar when she is finally convinced by the patrons to dance. When her husband becomes outraged by her behavior and sends her away, Meira almost doesn't seem sad or miss her baby as much as I imagined she would. Meeting Felix in New York meant that much to her. At this point in the movie you are cheering for her and you want her to find love. When Meira's husband shows up at Felix's apartment and asks him to talk - you realize how incredible the actors are. Each man brings volumes of emotion to the silences. The acting and the directing of this film were wonderful. You can't take your eyes off this actress. The last scenes were slow and complex. It leaves it up to the viewer to figure out where it's heading. Terrific film. Powerful.",1526601600,,1375,4.375

8719340,4,B00YYF741A,"I'm in the minority because I really enjoyed this movie. I'd actually been waiting a few years to see this, especially because Hadas Yaron (Meira) is a fantastic actress who I remembered from an Israeli film, Fill the Void (rent it if you can). This movie is a very subtle, romantic story but it's atypical of most films with an affair plot line. I did feel like some of the movie moved too quickly and I would have liked to see some more of Meira's ""outsider' behavior that caused her to drift. I still felt like this was a pretty compelling film. I have no idea how accurate this is in representing Hasidic Jewish culture but I've read stories from women who left their conservative Jewish marriage to join the secular world. It's a complex transition, at best, and I think the film did a good job showcasing Meira's development. I also have no clue why this film is rated R. There's no swearing, violence, or lewd content aside from a scene with very brief nudity. Seems like an odd choice for a film rating.",1499472000,3,1011,4.47027027027027
