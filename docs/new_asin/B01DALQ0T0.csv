7710404,3,B01DALQ0T0,"As a parent, I try to preview whatever the kids will be watching... Though I really enjoyed these, I feel they would be most appropriate for ages 7+, since a lot of them are lengthy and wordy and the subject matter is more serious. Don't get me wrong, they are lovely stories, but only a few of them a 3-4 year old would sit long enough for. The better ones for younger ones were Max's words, ish, the napping house, Pete's a pizza, spoon, and the one about the fly guy... kids can grow into the rest of these, and the only clunker in the lot was Uncle Elephant. I couldn't stand to watch the whole thing..my children are better off without that one altogether...

For the most part, these are very quiet stories---good for sick days or rainy days, but best for older children who can possibly better grasp segregation and slavery and war and hunting etc...
Isn't as useful as I had hoped right now, but will be someday....",1466553600,9,923,4.39766081871345
