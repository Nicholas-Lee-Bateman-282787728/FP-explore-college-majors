8409672,4,B003YMI5CQ,"This television show first aired on SBS in Australia at the start of the new millennium (2001) and ran for 3 seasons. The show's basis was to parody all the home improvement shows that where, and still are, flooding the world of television. It brought together 4 characters who gave their tips and tricks, ranging in what their expert-tease was (yes, I spelled that right!)

Dr. Rudi; He is a South African physician who offers advice on sex, medical conditions and relationships. Ranging from how to tell that ex-lover you don't want to date anymore, but also want to make sure she will not break your things when you do, through to advice on eating bowls of sugar, because it's much cheaper then buying all those expensive sports drinks.

Sigorny - She gives advice for the modern woman. Tips on love, spicing things up with your partner, how to enjoy sex even if it's that time of the month, and helpful guides to looking good, even when you're getting older then the younger women around.

Todd -  He is the handman of the show. He may be giving tips on how to build a shed around your car to disguise it as a dumpster when you can't find a place to park, or maybe giving a tip to those guys who don't know how to cook, but can make a KFC dinner box look like a 5 star meal, just by adjusting it's presentation.

Penne - She is the youth of the show, giving tips to the younger generation with things like how to score a few extra bucks, how to keep your parents love and affection if you fall pregnant by accident and how to score a lot of free stuff from gullible people.

These four characters give many ranges of tips and handy hints for in and around the home, as well as your outside lives. Some things may not hit the mark, but others can be pretty damn funny at times.

The actors who play these characters are not the same actors all through the 3 seasons. There is two actors that have played each of these characters all except for Sigorny... and sure, some people will complain others are better then the new one, but here you have all 3 seasons, and each season does have its fair share of hilarious stuff. Being Australian, I did have a bit of trouble locating this item, as many stores said something is wrong with the distribution of it, but I managed to find one on bay of E! and surprisingly it was an American company that is selling them. So if you are interested, check that out if you have trouble finding this 6 disc set.

Life Support is one of those shows that was not all that popular, but those who did manage to see it, seemed to love it and wish to find it on DVD to this day. It poked fun nicely at the shows it was taking off, but it also did them a bit harshly at times too, and thats why I loved it. It pushed the boundaries a few times, and probably will offend those who are easily offended. It is rated MA, so it's not recommended to anyone under 15. It's not a highly offensive show, but at times, you need to just keep in mind that it is a comedy show, not a real life one... however... some of the tips they give in some segments... they might just work for you! I know i', going to try a few!!",1324080000,2,3137,4.216666666666667
