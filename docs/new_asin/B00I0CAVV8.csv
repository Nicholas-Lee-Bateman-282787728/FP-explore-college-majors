Of course the acting is bad, it is a D-list/underground movie. This is basically a group of unknowns who are actually now famous within the LGBT community. Also, you need to watch the very first movie to understand the whole plot and how the characters intertwine. I hope she makes more movies and get better with time.",1481328000,,491,4.788235294117647

There were alot of subplots that I thought took away from the main storyline and it wasn't quite clear how they all connected; perhaps it comes together in the sequels. It started off a little slow, and didn't quite start to pickup til midway through but overall it was entertaining enough for me to want to see the sequel.",1474934400,,475,4.6

6246109,2,B00I0CAVV8,"I applaud the Chicago based actors and crew who took on issues of transgender, race, violence, HIV/AIDS and how all of these issues impact relationships, but there is much left to be desired here. The flow of the plot was mostly decent with some hiccups and some serious hanging threads, and some of the plot twists were not very twisty or just didn't add up at all, given the nature of the characters portrayed. I do hope for the next film that there is more development of the characters in sensible ways for the audience to follow. I know some would see the film and say that this is more of the same portraying Chicago as violent and just plain bad, and there is something to be said for that. But the film is trying to tell a story about the lives of people we often don't hear about. I didn't like the violent overtones at all, but they were part of the story as it was told in some cases.",1420416000,,895,4.239766081871345
6246110,2,B00I0CAVV8,The acting is transparent and the storyline/plot is dismembered which combined with a really unexpected ending will leave you even more perplexed. Some of the car scenes the director should have mounted the camera on a tripod to reduce all the jiggling and movement from the cameraman which caused me to come out of the scene and forget about the scene itself and focus on all the vibrations. I did watch the entire movie and I didn't hate it but I did not like it either. I just could not give it three stars and say that its okay.,1420329600,,532,4.383838383838384

This movie is a really gritty, about survival in an urban back drop of drugs, exploitation, sextual identity, betrayal, and self defeatist all wrapped up in a love story against all the odds.  I liked it because the writer took a chance to show her talents even if no one else with the funds could see her vision.

6246136,5,B00I0CAVV8,"I've seen quite a few comments about not liking it, because it was 75% based around the lesbian community. If that is what the root of your issue is, not only are you close minded but ignorant as well. The story line is great and if you're stuck wondering about certain things in the movie, there is 3 parts to the movie. To see how everything comes together you can watch all 3 parts. The profanity, sex, love, hood gangster feel was perfected. Sorta like the wire. Watching pt. 3 will show you how much the storyline, characters, camera and feel has grown. Great job!",1416787200,2,569,4.428571428571429
6246137,2,B00I0CAVV8,"I LOVED the 1st one so that's why I was eager to watch this one. But it was disappointing. Too much damn gratuitous violence. Too many 'hood or ghetto' cliches. I understand it's the genre but I get tired of 'studs' being portrayed as virtual replicas of male thugs. I hate it in 'straight' films as well. It's played out or 'blown' as Roni might say. We see this on film ALL the time & I'd like to see more balance. As for the actual storyline: there was zero chemistry between Tank & Bri. None. On the other hand, definite chemistry between the Roni & Bri characters, but damn, can one of them NOT get shot in one of these series? Aside from that, Milon Parker is great. I wish you could tackle one of my all time fave Iceberg Slim books, Mama Black Widow. I would love to see how you would handle that story since it doesn't seem like a major studio is going to ever do it. It's a period piece but i think based on what I've seen, with research, you would be able to do it. Just my opinion. But back to this series, I don't think I'll watch #3. The 1st one stands alone in quality (altho I'm not a fan of all this gay version of scarface s*** that seems to preoccupy too many 'studs') but you gotta play to your audience, right? Like I mentioned before, the 1st one was more balanced--we are not all either or & sex does not predominate in our lives anymore than it does any 'straight' person. But I will admit the sex scenes were some of the best I've seen--so I guess I'm a hypocrite. lolz. Anyway, continued success.",1416700800,15,1522,4.197952218430034

Most notably the acting was atrocious.  I cringed through the opening scene as they rode in the car,and I hoped that it would get better, it didn't.  The writing was bad but the performances were worse.  The scenes seemed staged and disjointed. The script had no continuity, and it was supposedly based on a novel, that doesn't say much for the novel. The best part of this movie is the cover art, unfortunately the cover art can't save this dog.  I watched a 9 minute film called the Matriarche that was 1/10 as long and 10 times better.

Based on the 1/4 of the movie I was able to watch, the primary problems are that the acting is horrible, the plot is disjointed, and the language is unnecessarily graphic and profane. I have no problem with movies in which a character occasionally uses profanity to emphasize points or to give the viewer a better idea of a character's personality.  In this movie, however, the characters use profanity and vulgar language just for the heck of it. When evaluating movies I can usually find something good to say about even the worst movies.

6246181,1,B00I0CAVV8,"To be candid, this is a review of only the first five minutes of this ""film"". I could only last so long after watching an opening sequence riddled with amateurish screams, a thankfully short fight, hoodlums and sistas spouting barely intelligible phrases. However, I am quite sure that the film must get better largely because it seems to have started by hitting rock bottom. Surely the only other way is 'up'? Unfortunately, I can't stick around to test my hypothesis. To watch another minute might qualify as 'cruel and unusual punishment'- not  justified even for free entertainment.",1408579200,10,586,5.041237113402062
