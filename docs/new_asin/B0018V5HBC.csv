8271213,5,B0018V5HBC,"From the three clowns occupying hospital beds to the caring staff, there is a laugh every turn. There's no bad language, violence, sex or inuendos.
British comedy at it's safest and best.",1395100800,3,187,4.875
8271214,5,B0018V5HBC,"This is one of the best Britcoms in our opinion.  It boasts some of the UKs best actors, and the characters and stories are hilarious, but believable.  Top marks for pathos and humour, but don't watch it after surgery or you'll break open your stitches!",1391472000,3,253,4.6
