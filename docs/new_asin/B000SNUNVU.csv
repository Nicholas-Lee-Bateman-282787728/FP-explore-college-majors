2888360,5,B000SNUNVU,"I have shared this video with my family and with my teenage religion class - only to have the same heartfelt, visceral results each time with every person who's seen it.  It's a wonderful evangelizing tool that teaches each of us that we are responsible and accountable for our actions, words and deeds - and it all brings us to the same place every time we watch it - back to Calvary...",1210464000,3,387,4.375
8206096,5,B000SNUNVU,"Great family Christian movie (with preteens and up) for later discussion, despite the not-so-good acting.  It has a really good message. The most unfortunate thing is the promo movie clip that is advertised at the front of this movie is not a family movie and we fly through it with fast forward.  The Sobbing Stone deals with the crucifixion of Jesus, but shows no violence, just sounds and the setting is contemporary and seen through the minds of some young researchers and their boss.  Intriguing movie!",1477872000,,507,4.872093023255814

8206098,3,B000SNUNVU,The movie is obviously an older movie set back in the 70's but otherwise a pretty good movie.,1409702400,,93,4.222222222222222
8206099,5,B000SNUNVU,Love this movie! It's a Christian thriller! A very smartly written story. Very spiritual I recommend this film to everyone.,1374451200,,123,5.2
8206100,1,B000SNUNVU,"This movie is terrible in so many ways. First, the story. It's an unusual one, which isn't a bad thing in itself, but ""The Sobbing Stone"" tries to be a mystery working up to a twist in the end, but fails miserably because the big revelation in the end is obvious from the beginning, which make the whole ""story"" pointless. There's lots of bad acting and tedious religious discussions that start out of nowhere not because it comes natural in the story but because the movie needs them because it is a Christian film and to pad the running time. Second, I can forgive a low budget feeling if a movie is well made but director and editor Robert G. Christie shows a complete lack of talent. I haven't seen such bad directing and editing in years. He seems to be unaware of such basics as the 180 degree rule.

There's really no reason to watch ""The Sobbing Stone"" unless you want to experience a new low in Christian filmmaking. This is a film that truly deserves its IMDb rating of 1,3/10. It makes movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-Me-Dance/dp/B0026XUOD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C Me Dance</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spirits-Among-Us/dp/B002EAJNHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spirits Among Us</a>"" look like Oscar material. This may very well be the worst Christian movie ever made outside of Nigeria (and at least ""666, Beware the End is at Hand"" had some entertainment value).",1366070400,,1483,5.41991341991342
8206101,4,B000SNUNVU,"It was not a high budget film, but the story was interesting, and held your attention until the end.  It will cause you to look at yourself, and consider what you would have done back then.",1265414400,,189,4.25
8206102,1,B000SNUNVU,"This movie is one of the worst I've seen, in terms of acting, script, and concept. Obviously, it's a christian propaganda film, where they mock science, scientists and the scientific establishment, where thinking is not allowed.",1240272000,,228,5.361111111111111
8206103,3,B000SNUNVU,"May have been inspired by Jesus' words that even if we, as humans, were to not give testimony to God, the rocks themselves would.  My son saw this movie on tv ans was positively affected by the story.  He wanted a copy of the movie. It is a storyline that needs some work but could have great potential.  As stated in other reviews, the quality of the production was less than polished.  Personally, the thing I had the hardest time with was the 'forced' acting and script glitches.  If someone could work on the script and make it more natural with a reasonable flow, then the message would be more powerful.  It's just that the characters would have 'reactions' or conjectures that were forceful and random that distracted from the continuity or point of the story.",1234742400,,767,4.602941176470588
8206104,5,B000SNUNVU,"I really liked this unusual movie. It has a real message of Christ's crucifixion. It should impact many.

8206105,1,B000SNUNVU,"The message of the sacrifice made for all humanity by the Son of God should be held as sacred.  I believe that the makers of this film had good and honorable intentions however the execution of the final product was simply put: horrible.  The acting, sound, and terrible camera work made this film very difficult to watch and very distracting to the important message we all must hear, the gospel.  I must apologize for such a critical review as the concept had intregue and I think the actors and producers hearts were in the right place.  ""Christian"" movies are fine but I believe that Christian movie makers should excell in their craft to present the gospel in the best possible light.  This may seem shallow but it is a reality that often the message is judged by the presentation.  See a film like ""The Last Sin Eater"" to see how it should be done.",1212796800,2,854,4.512987012987013
