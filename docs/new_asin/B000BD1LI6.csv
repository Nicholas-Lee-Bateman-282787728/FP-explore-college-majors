was buying a Ray Charles CD.  Instead there was a minimum of
music performed by Ray, and a lot of less than great performances by others.  Disappointing!",1182816000,4,227,4.769230769230769

8085324,4,B000BD1LI6,"Who in the heck is Sam Graham??! How can any ACCOMPLISHED critic start a review with, ""It is possible, even likely, that Ray Charles"" has put on a bad or perfunctory concert. But '50 Years of Music' isn't one of them. This guy is likely 'full of himself', and needs to come back to a more humble point of perception, before he writes another review of anything...except maybe HIMSELF!",1417305600,,384,4.579710144927536
8085325,3,B000BD1LI6,"Unfortunately, it was not as good as I  had expected. I would not recommed this one.  Have a gread day.",1354492800,,103,4.1
8085326,3,B000BD1LI6,Ray's performance is excellent but the quality of the film is not.  I never had the opportunity to see him perform in person so this is the closest I'll ever get. I only regret the quality wasn't better.,1310860800,2,203,4.342105263157895
8085327,5,B000BD1LI6,"What a great tribute to a man celebrating  50 years in music and his 61st birthday.  The live concert from 1990 or 1991, sounds excellent, lighting good and the mood is fun with a jazzy, soul, pop, country sound.  Many have come to celebrate and honor Ray Charles.  The concert shows backstage rehearsals,  interviews and comedy, one being  George Lopez.  There is something for the younger set, but the best comes from some of the best in solos and duets with Ray Charles.

Some memorable songs;  Ray Charles (What'd I Say);  (Livin' for the City) ;  (Just for a Thrill);  Stevie Wonder(Hallelujah);  Willie Nelson (Busted);  Michael Bolton (Georgia);  Willie Nelson (Busted);  Randy Travis (You're Cheatin' Heart);  Gladys Knight (I Wish I'd Never Love You At All);  Michael McDonald  (I Got a Woman);  Tevin Campbell (Just Ask Me To).  The finale is Ray leading with America The Beautiful.  Ray Charles shares his gratitude to his guests for making time for his celebration.  Great Music! .....Rizzo",1309219200,,1002,4.975609756097561
