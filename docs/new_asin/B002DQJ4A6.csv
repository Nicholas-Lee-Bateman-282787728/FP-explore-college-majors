3912351,5,B002DQJ4A6,"If you are a fan of Post Civil War Melodramas of the likes of Warner Brothers / ""The Little Foxes"" you are going to hold this film as one of your favorites!

The cast of Gary Cooper, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Neal, Jack Carson & Donald Crisp under Director Michael Curtiz deliver one of the best ensembles put together by Warner Brothers / Jack Warner!

I could elaborate on the plot but if anyone wonders what happen to characters like Vivian Leight from ""Gone With The Wind"" & Bette Davis from ""Jezebel""  on their next generations this ladies have nothing to envy Bette Davis character of ""Regina"" in ""The Little Foxes""

Now, needless to say that the male characters, Gary Cooper, Jack Carson & Donald Crisp not only hold their own but even the rest of the supporting cast make this one of the most dynamic team of actors put together by one of the most underrated Directors ever to grace the Silver Screen, Mr. Michael Curtiz!

This film will hold its own in anyones price collection of period films, I highly recommend it!",1327104000,,1024,4.573770491803279
3912352,5,B002DQJ4A6,"A great story of love and wealth, loss and loathing, Gary Cooper is one of my favorites, and will always be so, he is immortal, he had such feeling, and in this it shows true. If you like Gary and his movies, or you like a real story, then see this one of his.",1322265600,,260,3.8333333333333335
3912353,5,B002DQJ4A6,"I had seen this movie on the french TV about 25 years ago, and always wanted to watch it again,it is now possible through the WB archive collection. It's quite a good film directed by the great Michael CURTIZ,with a striking performance by ""COOP"" as a bad guy for a change,and a beautiful score by Victor YOUNG. Though not remastered, the DVD image and sound are in good shape. Thank you again,AMAZON,as it's impossible to get a copy of this film in Europe otherwise.",1285113600,6,467,4.571428571428571
3912354,5,B002DQJ4A6,"I agree whole-heartedly with the other reviewers who point to the fact that the Warner Archive edition of this outstanding film can be had for much less at the WB site and at the TCM site, which I believe is licensed to sell this series. On the TCM site, the WB archives films cost nearly $30 when they first come out, but fairly soon thereafter drop down to $17.99 plus s/h. Before the advent of the Warner Archives shut down the bootleggers, I had gotten myself a decent copy for only ten bucks, and I can't say that life was so bad under those conditions!

Cost considerations aside, you should mostly get your hands on a copy of this movie because it is just so darned good!  Cooper is a man obsessed with gaining power and exacting revenge for earlier humiliations that were visited upon him and his family by the arrogant and crotchety tobacco magnate, played to haughty perfection by Donald Crisp. Cooper's passions are caught between two alluring and powerful women: the slightly mad Patricia Neal, Crisp's diva-daughter who fights ferociously and subversively to hold onto daddy's plantation; and the cultured, highly-successful town prostitute, played as both sultry and sensitive by Lauren Bacall. Both Neal and Bacall are in their full bloom in this film, as both talents and as amazing objects of beauty. Jack Carson does a great job, just as he did in Mildred Pierce, of playing the amiable sidekick-turned-predator, and at times the film pivots on his portrayal--which is saying a lot given the pendulous pedigree of this cast. I can't recall a roll where Cooper was this fervent and driven to the point of being a loose cannon, but even more critical is his blindness to the dark side of his own inner demons.

This film has a much-undeserved obscurity to modern viewers due to never having-been released on VHS or DVD prior to the WB archive edition. It was rarely shown on TV as well. But now you can have one of your own to roll, and if you are a fan of Gary Cooper and post-Civil War period-drama pieces, you will just love this movie and wonder where it has been all your life!",1254268800,29,2098,4.634408602150538

3912361,2,B002DQJ4A6,"""Bright Leaf"" is a slog of a movie.  Slow, predictable and pointless.  We've all seen this film before and done better.  The cast is full of ""names"" and all are capable actors, Michael Curtiz directed and one wants and expects this effort to be much better than it is. Mr. Cooper looks tired and worn and is not alltogether convincing in the starring role.  The pace is sort of weird, the plotting silly and somehow, as studios were beginning to make new and different kinds of movies, ""Bright Leaf"" kept making me think I was watching something made in 1944. I cannot even recommend this movie as a good waste of time.",1430956800,,619,4.5

3912370,4,B002DQJ4A6,"Late nineteenth century in the South, Brant Royle returns to Kingsmont after being away due to new ambitions.  His family who
were tobacco farmers were put out of business and lost their entire estate at the hands of an unscrupulous tobacco magnate.
Returning with a renewed payback plan, he borrows money from an old lady acquaintance and produces a cigarette machine that
would replace 'hand-rolled' cigarettes.  With this invention, he is able to corner the raw tobacco leaf market and put the current
established magnate on his heels. He is attracted to the magnate's daughter in his quest to put him out of business. Tensions
arise and a deadly gentlemen's duel becomes a turning point in this story.",1402185600,2,705,4.966101694915254

Yes, and smokin', too, in this watchable story of one man's effort to corner the nascent cigarette market in 1890s NCarolina.  Good listeners will recognize the inspiration for Dvorak's ""Going Home"" movement in his ""New World Symphony,"" and good watchers will see Jack Carson in one of his more sympathetic roles.  And do get the ""hard"" DVD, not the manufactured on demand kind, to avoid the problems that accompany the latter, as others have noted.",1379116800,,536,5.0
3912373,5,B002DQJ4A6,"This is a wonderful, somewhat obscure, black and white film that was deftly directed by Michael Curtiz. With a wonderful musical score by Victor Young and a compelling story, those who like watching old fashioned melodramas will most certainly enjoy this one. Stellar performances are given by the all star cast in this melodrama about passion, revenge, retribution, and redemption.

The action takes place in tobacco country in the reconstruction south. Gary Cooper plays a poor tobacco farmer who has been away from home since his farm and home were foreclosed on by a wealthy competitor, played by Donald Crisp. He now returns to make good and reclaim what he feels is his. When he arrives, he hooks up with his old flame and friend played by Lauren Bacall. Now the madam of a successful brother, she is flush and in the money. So, when he needs some start up money to begin his plan of righting some wrongs, he turns to her for help.

Unfortunately, despite our lovely madam's heart of gold and her open pocketbook, he does not reciprocate her affections fully and, instead, has his sights set on Donald Crisp's haughty, capricious daughter, played to perfection by Patricia Neal. Eventually, he does get everything that he ever wanted, but things are not always as they seem, as he soon discovers to his detriment.

The entire cast gives superlative performances. Donald Crisp is in his element playing an arrogant aristocrat, who eventually gets hoisted by his own petard. Patricia Neal, as his daughter, also outdoes herself as the love interest with her own secret mission. Lauren Bacall gives a very well-nuanced performance, one of her best, really, as the madam with a heart of gold. Jack Carson also gives an excellent performance as Gary Cooper's good old boy sidekick, who is one of the first to see that success is rapidly becoming his pal's ruination. Gary Cooper gives an intense performance as the homeboy with a dark side who returns to make good only to find that everything he wanted is not all it is cracked up to be.",1365379200,6,2039,4.803418803418803
3912374,4,B002DQJ4A6,This movie has a lot of semential value for me because it was one I saw as a teenager with my Father.  BRIGHT LEAF is a story of obsessive love and the means to get the power to have this woman while leaving the true love behind.  In ther end the woman he got stole everything he had and the true love saw him ride out of town exactly as he road in.  Its a little like GONE WITH THE WIND only roles are reversed.  It is an older black and white picture and the acting isn't superb but the movie is very m;uch worth buying and watching.,1357689600,2,535,3.925925925925926

8365787,4,B002DQJ4A6,"Trying to formulate an intelligent review on this movie it occurs to me I don't really understand the plot. So we have a poor character (Gary Cooper) who chooses to pursue wealth only because he wants to gain the affections of his advisory's daughter. Once he achieves total success at the price of the life of his advisory and the daughter agrees to marriage with stipulations he also loses the affections of a women so committed in her love for him. The ending is bizarre in that the Gary Cooper character loses most everything and also the love of the other women but seems content in his lose and rides away as though ""nothing gained, nothing lost"". This movie is both consuming and sort of frustrating. I wished it would have ended better.",1486857600,,744,4.601503759398496
