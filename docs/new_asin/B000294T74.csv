2069332,5,B000294T74,"i found this interesting the first time around even though alot of it is like their home videos of the Big Foot truck from the beginning. The commentary is informative but kind of BORING, i think. My baby boy on the other hand must watch this show at least twice a day or he'll throw a FIT!! He love love LOVES monster trucks and this DVD has plenty of car crushes, hill climbs, crashes/rollovers, and even some driving on top of the water. Even my 8 year old likes this show. Well worth the money, even if Mommy is sick of it.",1174694400,9,527,4.176470588235294

2069334,5,B000294T74,My 16 month old son and his 3 and 5 year old nephews really enjoy this DVD. My son watches it almost everyday. I recommend this video to anyone who has young boys who like trucks. I wish Tonka had made more DVD's.,1135641600,10,213,3.9767441860465116
2069335,1,B000294T74,"I bought this DVD for my husband and 2 boys as a Father's Day gift & we were all quite disappointed. Instead of action-packed, it's amateur video clips & boring narration. Save your (...)",1119916800,39,187,4.529411764705882
8024129,4,B000294T74,"With owner commentary this shares the history of the first monster truck, including their first car crushing experience as they did not know if it would even work. Then shows initial show appearances when rules did not exist. Additionally there are movie appearances and commercial cameos.

Shows hill climbing, water crossings, crashes, and JUMPS! Interesting and insightful.",1525996800,,376,5.5964912280701755

8024133,2,B000294T74,Campy and a little short. Great for a little boy who loves monster trucks from the 1980's!  Maybe someone young at heart?,1367366400,,121,4.5
8024134,5,B000294T74,I purchased this dvd for my 3-year-old son who is a major monster truck fanatic & a huge Bigfoot fan. We love watching this dvd together. Bon Chandler & Jim Kramer do a great job narrating & have included some awesome Bigfoot footage!,1362787200,,234,4.465116279069767
8024135,4,B000294T74,I bought this for my 3 year old monster truck lover. It's a great video for the price. He doesn't like it as much as some others though because there is more narrative and not as much variety in trucks featured. Great for any Bigfoot fan though.,1283731200,2,245,4.23404255319149
8024136,5,B000294T74,"Great monster truck footage. Although there is a lot of talking in the dvd(more for older kids to adults) my 3 year old loves it, watches it at least twice a day. Would highly recommend it.",1237420800,3,189,4.277777777777778
8024137,1,B000294T74,We were really disapointed in the show. We already have 2 different Monstertruck DVD with WAY more action then on this one. My 3 year old got bored with all the commentary on there. I think they could have made it a bit more kid friendly. Little boys wanna see races and stunts and action action action...For an adult its interesting listening about all the informations about the truck. My hubby will love it he is a HUGE Big Foot Fan.,1235433600,3,436,4.395061728395062
8024138,1,B000294T74,"My 2 1/2 yr old grandson is a HUGE monster truck fan. He really only knows the Monter Jam circuit so I thought I'd get this to show him bigfoot. Well, what a flop. He watched it once, about half way through and does not ever want to watch it again.. :(",1175472000,3,252,3.8653846153846154
