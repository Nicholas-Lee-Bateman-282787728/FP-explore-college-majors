3875523,5,B00290X6NW,"This is Carol Butler's son writing this review. Even though I am only 19, I love old TV commercials. Back when the commercials actually made sense and made you want to buy the item that was being pitched. I've purchased a few classic commercial sets before, and was not really impressed. Not to say that I didn't enjoy the commercials. I did, indeed. But, the quality was... well... horrible. I could hear the sound, but the visual quality of most of the commercials was either blurry or dim. But, I'm sure I'll enjoy this set, if I do decide to purchase it. If it's from Mill Creek, then I'm most certain I'll be satisfied.",1247702400,4,624,4.482456140350878
3875524,4,B00290X6NW,"Exactly what I was expecting, over 16 hours of old television commercials from the '50s, '60s & '70s .  I would have given this product 5 stars but the picture quality on many of the commercials isn't that good-- I guess that's to be expected.  Nothing here has even remotely been digitalized or enhanced in any way. These commercials have been sitting on dusty shelves in a basement somewhere since the last time we saw them, some over 50 years old.  For the price it's definately worth it. I bought another series of old commercials last month and paid $25 for only 3 hours.  Those exact same commercials are on these DVDs PLUS 13 MORE HOURS!!!  One bit of advice if you buy this product...buy two sets.  If you lend this out to a baby boomer you'll never see it again.",1247702400,106,771,4.432624113475177

3875526,3,B00290X6NW,"So it's $5 and some of the other reviewers did note the picture quality isn't very good. Still, I said to myself ""Hey, it's $5! And I am not super picky about quality. It'll just be fun to see the commercials."" I was wrong. I must be pickier than I realize. I simply couldn't sit through more than a handful. The quality was really, really bad. Had I understood the degree of how poor it was I never would have purchased it. My two cents.",1493596800,3,438,4.1647058823529415

3875529,5,B00290X6NW,"This is a well-organized collection, in an easy-to-watch delivery method. Sure, these commercials are in the public domain and if you know where to look and what to look for you can find all this stuff for free on the innerwebs. BUT, this puts them all together for you, sorted (by genre) with plug & play simplicity to enjoy. For the older generation who would have watched these as they aired on TV they're probably not technologically-savvy enough to want to sit at the computer and search these out. However, they can work a DVD player and would probably really enjoy sitting and reminiscing about the old days. I bought this set for my parents, and ended up watching it myself before mailing it to them! For a very reasonable price you've paid for the convenience aspect of this set's organization. As others have said some of the commercials have degraded in quality, that's a function of the age of the film before it was digitized. That can't be helped and be happy they've been salvaged at all! So many pieces of history have been lost due to either being taped over or degradation of film media with passage of time. This set is absolutely worth the price tag, especially if it's meant as a gift for an older person.",1490486400,,1226,4.577272727272727

--------------------------------------------------

This review is dedicated to my father, Joel Rudoff.  I started watching this DVD set with him back in January 2011.  We got about halfway through Disc 1 when Hurricane Sandy struck at the end of October 2012.  The storm destroyed a lot of our personal property, including lots of irreplaceable family photos and mementos, and also many items in our DVD and Blu-ray collection, such as this DVD.  We repurchased it (again from Target for $5.00) in 2013 after we moved into a new house.  Sadly, we never got back to watching it again before my father passed away in January 2014.  Now, in May 2015, I finally was able to watch the entire DVD set with other family members.

This is a set of 1,001 (1,016 if you include all of the short films) classic black-and-white and color ""commercials"" from the 1950s to the 1970s, with one 1980s PSA thrown in just to be different.  As far as I understand it, anything after 1976 is automatically copyrighted, and thus can't fall into the public domain.  That's why you won't find anything after the 1970s in this set (save for the one PSA).  Too many of these things are not standard commercials.  Some are excerpts from shows where they would stop the show - namely game shows and variety shows - to do a live ad.  Some are short films, a few of which don't belong here.  Some are just the quick sponsor tags at the end of a show (for example, ""Bewitched has been brought to you by Clairol"").  Some of these ""commercials"" are TV show title sequences (Beverly Hillbillies and Annie Oakley), and some are sponsor spots from TV series (Petticoat Junction, Dick Van Dyke, Andy Griffith).  In fact, you'll find a LOT of commercials with famous, and not-yet-famous celebrities.  Be sure to look out for Kurt Russell and Billy Mumy as children, a pre-""Facts of Life"" Charlotte Rae taking a shower, and a pre-""Good Times"" John Amos as a cop.

The political ads were almost all for the Eisenhower-Nixon re-election campaign in 1956.  I would have liked to have seen some variety there.  I was hoping the infamous Lyndon B. Johnson 1964 ""Daisy Girl"" ad would have been included.  I also would have liked to have seen one of Dinah Shore's ""See The USA In Your Chevrolet"" ads on the disc.  There is one Dinah Chevrolet ad, but she isn't singing that song in it.  Also missing, is the famous ""Let's all go to the lobby"" theater intermission spot.  I was hoping it would have been in the Drive-In Ads section, though it's a theater commercial.  Sadly, it's not here at all.

What is here, are a bunch of short films that are not commercials and have no business being here.  You'll find the 1954 ""Tobacco & The Human Body"" educational short film from Encyclopaedia Britannica that eats up 15-minutes inconclusively trying to prove the harmful effects of tobacco on the human body.  There wasn't enough evidence at the time to draw the conclusions we can now, but that didn't stop the scientists from mercilessly torturing poor, innocent rabbits in the name of ""research"".  In the Cars section(!) is a 22-minute short about the residents and businesses of Levittown, Pennsylvania entitled ""Our Home Town"".  Why it's here, much less in the Cars section, is beyond me.  Both of the items in the ""Holiday"" section don't belong here: the ""Christmas Brings Joy To Everyone"" Universal Studios newsreel clip, and some unknown stop-motion Christmas clip that seems to serve no purpose at all.

This set spans three single-sided, dual-layer discs, with an approximate runtime of 16 hours (according to the packaging).  Video format is 4:3 Fullscreen, with one commercial and one short film in letterbox.  There is a Play All for each section on Discs 1 and 2, but no Play All for Disc 3.  However, on Discs 1 and 2, even if you select each individual group of commercials, at the end it'll continue to the next group, instead of going back to the menu.  So, even if you don't want to play all, it essentially does it anyway.

Chapters are placed after each commercial, which is a nice touch.  It shows that some effort was given to the presentation.  The content is very well organized, and even sub-organized for the first two discs.  All commercials for the same brand of product are grouped together - for example, all Coca-Cola or Marlboro ads are shown back-to-back - but they're not in chronological order, or even grouped by color format.  If they didn't have the years, and thus couldn't put them in chronological order, they could have put the black-and-white commercials first and then the colors ones for each brand.  This is much better than jumping back and forth between color formats.  There are four John Wayne commercials for Great Western Savings that actually give the date they were filmed at the end, but they're not in chronological order, which is a shame since it would be *very* easy to do (just put a certain one before the others).

Quality is a very mixed bag.  Some are quite good, some okay, some are standard public domain quality, and some are nearly unwatchable.  As others have pointed out, it's mostly the color commercials that suffer the most.  Since a bunch of the color commercials have the same poor quality, I get the feeling that they all came from the same source (very likely an old videotape).  Some people have complained about the bad quality.  Although it's understandable why they're upset, you can't go into a public domain DVD release expecting anything close to fantastic video and audio quality.

Some commercials have ""SV"" in the lower left corner, indicating that Mill Creek ""stole"" these commercials from another source that branded their releases with those initials.  I know that some commercials were stolen from Catcom releases, as I caught a quick flash of one of their screens before one of the PSA's.  All of the commercials from one of Catcom's Beverly Hillbillies releases are on here.  However, there are no Mill Creek logos on any of the videos, so that's a good sign.

I rated this release 4 out of 5 stars.  I took off half a star for Mill Creek's standard practice of cramming too much stuff onto each disc, thus resulting in some unnecessary compression artifacts and poorer quality.  I took off the other half star due to the quality.  Some of the videos are just a little TOO poor in quality.  That said, for five bucks, the quality and variety (or lack thereof in some sections) is quite acceptable.

Below is a list of categories on the discs, the number of commercials in each category, the runtimes of each commercial set in minutes and seconds (one set on Disc 3 goes past an hour), and the brands/products covered.  Most brands/products have multiple commercials.  I'm also listing what are the notable highlights are to me.

Also a commentary on how society has changed. Several of the toy commercials would be politically-incorrect these days - lots of toy guns and shoot-em-up stuff. Even a cold war missile train set!

There are three disc in this set, each DVD is about different kind of commercials.  Of course, the restaurant didn't show the cigarette or beer commercials (children go to this restaurant), but at-home viewing is great.

3875582,4,B00290X6NW,I like the old commercials on this 3 DVD set. When they copied them some of them are not the best to watch. Some of them have some flaws in them from transferring them and probably from the old films they took them off of. I basically like the old commercials not all the commercials are not so great to view but some of them are. And the other one's are in great condition to view. I would buy this DVD if I didn't own it already just to have the old commercials to watch flaws in it or not. I enjoy watching them from a good time in life gone by.

3875592,2,B00290X6NW,"Great concept - Poorly executed!! At least they are organized by category - other than that - there are NO references to When these were made - not even a year. No history - just here are a bunch of commercials. Not much of a menu - and when I select one category - it automatically goes to the following one afterwards - without announcing what it is.
The commercials are a mixture of black and white and color. My main beef is No one did ANY restoration. Some commercials are crystal clear - while others are so blurry - I could barely make them out.
There are indeed some fun ones to see - Flintstones and other classics.
I would have loved if there were some sort of alternate audio - hearing commentary about the times and situations. Who did the voice overs. I picked this up for about $5.00 - and it might be worth that much.
I'm sure some people did a lot to get all these commercials together - but they didn't finish the job of adding ANY information - if is up to the viewer to know the history.
I would prefer a documentary about the history of TV commercials - and how they evolved. Scott M.",1395878400,,1104,4.212264150943396

3875597,5,B00290X6NW,After reading some of the reviews I was not expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  The commercials are listed in categories so if you don't care about food commercials just skip them.  Some people complained about the fuzzy quality or marginal image but I was there when they first were aired and guess what? They were blurry back then too!  Overall I loved this since it brought back a lot of good memories.  Thanks.,1389744000,2,424,4.6891891891891895

Back then, advertising was a work of art, and people weren't bombarded with it like we are today. Back in the good old days...

The subject matter varies greatly - Beer, Cars, Toys, Cigarettes, and Cosmetics have the most. There are also things like Oil & Gas, Tourism, Politics, Cameras, Coffee, Banks, Military - you name it, it's on this set. There are also a few longer films, such as several films for the oil industry, and also one about the dangers of smoking.

This is a huge collection of commercials for a very small price.  I more than got my money's worth out of it.  Some notes:

* As mentioned by others, the video quality of the commercials go all the way from decent to awful.  The vast majority are OK.
* As best I can tell (hint: look at the ladies' hairstyles and the mens' sideburns), most of the commercials are from the 1950s and 60s.  A few are earlier, some stretch into the '70s.  One of the PSAs dates from the mid-80s.
* ""Classic"" seems to be kind of a stretch, since I doubt these are the best or most famous commercials of the era.  Don't get me wrong, some of them ARE good and/or famous (many mentioned in other reviews), but this is more of a random sampling of commercials.  I think that works better, IMO.
* Most commercials are the standard 15-120 second television spots, but some came from surprising sources:  ""sponsored by"" announcements, live spots from the show's stars, commercials from the movies, even a few longer films for store buyers.
* This is an era before political correctness.  Subtle and not-so-subtle racism and sexism pop up in many of these commercials, so if you're easily offended, you might want to skip this (or skip those offending commercials as they pop up).
* There are several Alka-Seltzer commercials here, but only one features Mr. Speedy.  They could have picked other icons who are featured more often in this collection.",1321228800,8,1612,4.574912891986063

If you care to look into it as a document of our changing times over the past 60 or so years, here's a tidbit. A ""Family Size"" box of Cheerios weighed in at 10.5 oz. WOW! Today, that's a snack-pack.

I won't get into much of the voluminous set, but I nearly wet myself with disbelief and glee at the PSA for VD from the early 70s. The PSA was a song called VD is for Everybody and showed regular folks - teachers, regular folks in your life, etc. and a catchy song about VD. That alone is worth the price of admission, folks.

If you're at all curious about Americana and the advertising machine of a bygone era, this is worth your time and small investment.
Enjoy!",1309910400,3,926,4.25
3875642,5,B00290X6NW,"I received my copy of 1001 Classic Commercials yesterday and began watching. The commercials are as entertaining to watch as any movie or TV program... possibly because such commercials were even more prevalent in our lives than the shows they sponsored. They were everywhere, every day, over & over... a reminder of where you were and what you were doing at any given period in your life.

My childhood was in the late 60's thru the 70's. I have fond memories of things like the Quisp & Quake cereal commercials, Cap'n Crunch, Sugar Bear (Post Super Sugar Crisp), and Shasta soda. I long for a return to the days of ""Sugar"" being advertised prominently on a cereal box and steel soda cans with pull tab tops (that you could make chains from). You will definitely see that in this collection.

There are some like a Shasta cola commercial (""Tickles your tummy instead of your nose!"") that I had not seen since I was 7 or 8 years old. Same for the Kool-Pops commercial except I was even younger! As far as the Post Raisin Bran commercial with the singing raisins, I had never seen the commercial as a kid, but I knew the words by heart from hearing George Carlin sing it on his 1973 ""Occupation: Foole"" album! (I listened to Carlin as a teenager in high school.)

I have only gotten through most of the first DVD. In the Toys chapter: ""Guns & Projectiles"" section my teenage son and I were sighing wistfully at the Mattel Shootin' Shell cap guns (with Greenie Stick Em' caps). Oh to go to Toys R' Us today and buy a toy GUN that actually fires plastic slugs with a *bang*! Or the awesome Johnny Seven One Man Army gun by Topper! Still available on e-bay... hundreds of dollars for an intact, fully working gun. Back when boys played cowboys, or soldiers, or cops... and it was good, clean fun!

Another great thing is the many celebrity appearances. How about Clayton Moore & Jay Silverheels, as (the original) Lone Ranger & Tonto for Jeno's Pizza Rolls, Louis Armstrong for Ideal's Suzy Cute doll, The 5th Dimension for Jello gelatin, and any 70's child worth his salt will remember Euell Gibbons for Post Grape Nuts!

How about Allan Sherman (of ""Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh"" fame) hawking Milton Bradley's ""Camp Granada"" board game!

Priceless!

As for the many complaints about the quality of several of the commercials, especially the washed-out or over saturated color in many of the 70's selections, I say this... What do you want for FIVE BUCKS?

All whiners go home.

Would a archaeologist spend weeks digging up an ancient clay pot then throw it back because it has a chip in it?

This collection is like a historical artifact. A bundle of memories and a look back at the attitudes, styles, and even morals of the past... all for a few dollars. If you want color correction and digital remastering, by all means try to find such an extensive collection and pay more.

If you are really so disappointed at the video quality, then many of these commercials are available - and in better quality - on sites like Youtube.com, [...], and [...]. With  software such as VDownloader (free) or SoThink Video Downloader (not free but cheap) you can download these ads to your hard drive and/or burn to a DVD...

...but don't knock a whole book because a few pages are creased or smudged.

As for the comments about problems with navigating the menus, or not being able to selectively play a particular chapter or section, I have not encountered any of that so far. I have also used 2 different DVD players with no trouble on either. The problem could lie with the age or quality of the player used.

I have had some DVDs where reviewers have complained about the discs locking up at certain points and I have indeed confirmed this by viewing them on my old DVD player (bought in 2001). I played them again on a newer player (bought in 2003) and the DVD played right through the trouble spots without a hiccup. I assume it is because he newer players have improved error correction & optics.

(FYI: the DVDs I speak of are The Waltons 1st Season, Buck Rogers In The 25th Century, and The Outer Limits Season 1 & 2.)

The one thing I'm not crazy about is the packaging. The DVD case sturdy enough, but it is one of those where the discs themselves are packages in paper/plastic sleeves and placed inside the case. I would have preferred a package where the discs come mounted on the case itself. A minor discrepancy.

Anyway, this is a great archive for nostalgia buffs and you can't beat the price for all that you get.

I highly recommend this collection!",1308096000,13,4553,4.5712530712530715

Most of the commercials I had never seen before, since they were from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  Some I had seen via YouTube or other Internet video sharing sites, but the problem there is sometimes they get pulled due to copyright laws.

I expected to see the ""crying Indian"" pollution commercial, but never in my life did I expect to see PSA's that were shown in movie theaters alongside news reels and cartoon shorts.

Speaking of cartoon shorts, one that really caught me off guard was the Bugs Bunny ""Any Bonds Today?"" advert, which, yes, Virginia, is on this collection.  Uncut with Bugs in blackface, imitating Al Jolson, that would have been cut on any other DVD.",1302134400,,1298,5.417910447761194

- three separate DVD disks
- very poor image copies / prints on a number of commercials - like someone took the images off the TV set....

-proper editing out of the poor commercials would make this a better item - maybe down to 10 hours instead of a bloated 16 hours ....

-nice memories of a more innocent time ....

3875649,5,B00290X6NW,"Even after reading several other reviews about the poor quality of the video, I bought the collection to see them anyway.
I'm glad I did because of the memories many of these commercials bring back. Although I didn't find any indication of what years are covered it looked to me like the 1950's to the early 1970's. It is a 3 DVD set with each disk covering groups of different topics. Some topics have just a few and others have many commercials on the disk. The box says 16 hours of commercials and I won't dispute that. Even I couldn't sit through that many commercials at one time so I've just been watching here and there.

And yeah, the video quality isn't the greatest on many of the commercials. But the viewer needs to keep in mind that like so much from that era of time, most (if not all) of the commercials were on film and not made with the idea of lasting and becoming the cultural significance they'd ultimately become.  And to be honest, if you're of my age group (53) and mainly looking for the memory factor this is a great collection and for the Amazon price.
If you want to show family (grand kids) what things were like in the eras represented in the commercials, I think this collection and the commercials included are an excellent snapshot of the clothes and culture of those times!

I grew up in the ""Greater Los Angeles area"" and do recall quite a few of the commercials, especially the toys and games. And although I never smoked, I think I'd take cigarette commercials again over the medicine commercials shown nowadays!!
I do recommend this collection.",1292371200,35,1581,4.540350877192982
3875650,4,B00290X6NW,"This Mill Creek budget DVD is packed with 1,001 TV commercials that aired in the 1950's-1970's. Times and censorship have changed. Cigarette ad's can't be shown on television these days. The DVD's also show old school TV spots featuring Patty Duke, Kurt Russell, The Monkees, Bugs Bunny, Yogi Bear, Danny Thomas, John Wayne, and others. There's classic TV spots for 7-Up and Coca-Cola. There's the public service announcement with the Native American crying over garbage!
Keep in mind these retro TV spots are shown in a muddy, unrestored condition. Also, you may feel numb after watching 16 solid hours of commercials!",1291766400,2,619,5.138613861386139

3875653,4,B00290X6NW,"The people complaining about the bad quality of many of the commercials need to get a clue. When these commercials were made, NO ONE thought they would be of value any time in the future, so they didn't bother to maintain the prints. Complainers should instead be thankful they can see these commercials at all. Anyway, I am still working my way through the first disc of the set, and so far I've been very entertained, even though I did not grow up during the eras of these commercials. Some of the commercials are effective even today (I'd like to try Shasta soda pop, but it isn't available in Canada!), and others are quirky and/or unintentionally hilarious. This is a good DVD set to pull out when you have free time but not enough to watch a full-length movie - just select a category on any of the DVDs, and you'll be entertained for that short time.",1282867200,7,857,4.464968152866242

3875655,3,B00290X6NW,"This is, perhaps, the best collection of its kind since, on all three of these disks, so much time is given over to really mining the available vaults for some of the rarest of the various advertising libraries, but my desire for collections of this kind leans more toward the classic ""anti-commercial"", that is, the ultimate CLASSIC COMMERCIALS collection for those of us who hate commercials.  Also, I was indeed searching for some TV ads that were omnipresent in my youth of too much TV watching, like the many, many Jay Ward animated ads, the CHOO CHOO CHARLIE ads for Good 'N' Plenty candy, the bizarre and frenetic Mazola Corn Oil ad that follows a woman dashing wildly with a shopping cart, seeking out the ingredients for herself, with the hand-held camera following her every step as the announcer inquires, ""what if you had to search for all the good ingredients found in one bottle of Mazola Corn Oil?...""  It is a little-known ad, now, but it was shown a lot on daytime TV, but it now seems to be so difficult to find.  This collection is also missing some real treats that I'd seen in private collections, like the cereal ads created by Jay Ward or even those around ""LINUS THE LION-HEARTED"" which was technically the very first cartoon show that came off as a half-hour info-mercial for kids.  And one other minor thing that rather put me off about this set is that it seems to dip its toe into political ads of our distant past, but stops at a handful of ads for Eisenhower/Nixon.  Why not explore just about every political party ad in America over the past 50 years?  There have been network and cable TV specials aimed at unintended comedy in classic commercials, but this set seems to sometimes take itself seriously, as more a lesson in advertising instead of allowing us to laugh at ourselves as seen in classic TV ads.  However, this set does give a bit of a peak into all that pop culture, with celebrities hocking all kinds of products, but those vaults are quite deep, and this company really could continue its mining of those vaults like it has mined public domain cartoons.  Either that, or someone please start a zany website aimed at exhausting that library of classic ads for us curious types that would like to visit some of the wildest ads of our youth, some which featured subliminal messages unintended as such and featuring very beautiful women.  I know that filmmakers could learn from some of the camera tricks in the classic ads of which I speak.  The afore-mentioned Mazola ad was very much like it were shot for an old silent comedy with the violent and fast music accompanying the woman's stumbling around and diggging up vast real estate and crop to gather, greedily, the items that she needs.  It is almost like something out of a classic animated cartoon.  If anyone reading this knows where I could find this ad, please let me know.  There were other such ads that have been avoided, like the Goodyear ""Tiger Paws"" tire commercials narrated by the golden voice of Ken Nordine or the yodeling Levi's jeans ad which is an incredible stop motion work of art in the mid-1970's.  Most of these types of ads did make sense and left an indellible image in our minds, but the ads now seem to be gone forever, and it is hard to mine the amounts of DVD's on the market in order to find this stuff, even though most such collections aren't really all that expensive.  Surely, someone must know where the best array of such ads are, outside of the various Museums of Television and Radio broadcasts.  I'd last seen the Ken Nordine ""Tiger Paws"" ads at the Manhattan Museum of Television & Radio, as part of a network airing of an episode of ""VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA"".  Maybe some of the video companies could be persuaded to do what was done with the ""HONEY WEST"" DVD set, include a handful of classic TV ads as special feature on each of the DVD's surrounding the classic TV show in question.  That might be another way of mining those vaults, and these could include the network ads announcing the creation of the TV show being spotlighted.",1271894400,3,4083,4.577503429355281

Obviously the quality varies. Some (especially the early color ones) are nearly unwatchable. But the gems outweigh the chaff. Or something.
When you get multiple ads for the same product, they do get redundant. The cigarette category was especially bad in this regard.

3875674,4,B00290X6NW,"I've been buying disks and tapes of old commercials for about a decade now. This three disk set will likely contain a fair number of the ads that regulars to public domain and retro media sites already have bought before now. But one nice plus this collection has, which the others I have had definitely do not, is a chapter break for each commercial. It's not a complete index of every commercial. It's the ability to hit your remote's chapter advance button and move to the next commercial, one ad at a time, through each disk. This makes cueing specific ads up, or skipping items of less interest to you, much easier than any other collection I've seen. (Most disks on the market seem to be made up of bulk transfers of old ads in 30 to 50 commercial chunks. Much of this material came straight from an online archive of public domain material in this form, and until now, no one has troubled to break it up for easier use.)

The video quality is of a very wide range, and some of the images are a mess. But anyone with a passing-to-serious interest in old commercials, or pop culture from the 50s to the 70s, should pick one of these up for general purposes. It pretty much ""retires"" about half the commercial sets I have bought up until now.
