7901805,4,9871684010,"This was a spendy dvd for me but definitely money well spent.  Great introduction to the Argentinian big game as well as an entertaining roadmap of some of the better estancias.  The only flaw in my opinion in the two disc set is that Mr. Boddington did not expound on the rifles and ammo he used.  Col. Boddington is widely considered to be ""the authority"" on big game hunting and I would have appreciated hearing his opinion on rifles and loads.  He touched on them but as an avid shooter\ reloader i would appreciate much more. It takes less than one minute to introduce us to the rifles and tell what bullet he used and how it performed beyond what we see on film.  Some great footage of the country and native background music.  Fuels my desire to hunt there someday.  Or maybe just go there with my wife for the food. . .",1422489600,,827,4.3311688311688314
