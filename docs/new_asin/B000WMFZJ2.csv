I thought this episode was awesome.  It was full of interesting information and seriously cute animals.  And, I think Jeff Corwin is pretty cute, too.  Sometimes he can be kind of corny, but I think he's hilarious.  Once, when he came to my college to give a talk/Q and A session, I was able to meet and hug him.  So, being able to watch him for free through amazon instant watch is awesome.

I am going to go on a limb here and recommend this for kids about 6 plus. I was going to give it a 4 star rating however my 6 year old granddaughter simply loves it, so it's a 5. This series and another series will be good indoor entertainment when winter comes.

2986584,4,B000WMFZJ2,"TV host Jeff Corwin is a big bundle of boyish enthusiasm, skipping through rainforests and desert landscapes in search of rare and unusual animals. It's like having Joey and Ross from ""Friends"" fused into a single character, and then set out on safari with a film crew in tow: Corwin is physical and rambunctious, but also knowledgeable and able to rattle off scientific facts about poisonous critters that he's just dug out of the underbrush -- obviously working from memory, since the viper or dart frog or whatever isn't waiting around for him to read anything off of a cue card.

The show has an appealing improvisational air about it, with has its plusses and minuses. On the plus side, the show is exciting and quickly draws you in; Corwin has a cheerful, magnetic presence and his enthusiasm for nature comes through clearly. He also consistently works in eco-friendly messages and talks about having respect for nature, about leaving wild animals alone (especially dangerous ones) and about the need to protect habitat, etc. On the down side, you get a nagging feeling that there's a lot of information that is being left out, and that the mini-lectures Corwin delivers while, say, holding the deadliest viper in Central America, might not be as thorough as it might otherwise be. Corwin is sensitive to how much each animal is willing to put up with, and once he drops the animal back into the wild, the encounter (and the lecture) is over with. Also, his hands-on approach seems pretty invasive -- even though he often is taking part in scientific studies (tagging animals, etc.) and takes great pains to explain that what he is doing has been officially sanctioned, the overall effect may be to encourage audience members to mess about with wild animals themselves, which may have unfortunate consequences.

On balance, though, the show is informative and fun: one of the most amusing aspects is how totally into snakes Corwin is. So, if you like to see rare and deadly and beautiful serpents, this is definitely the show for you! There are plenty of mammals and birds, too, but Corwin does love the creepy crawlies. Overall this is a fun show, definitely worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain kid's reviews)",1211241600,,2229,4.894179894179894
2986624,5,B000WMFZJ2,Jeff Corwin is a great host! He is in my opinion one of the best ones out there and it is a shame he isn't hosting any more shows.

2986625,5,B000WMFZJ2,"I think my 9-yr.-old son has decided he wants to be Jeff Corwin when he grows up. Corwin has a major fascination and love for not only snakes but also all wildlife. He is always so excited and enthusiastic about his wildlife encounters (and some of that wildlife is of the two-legged variety). Unlike some other wildlife shows with main characters like this, Corwin shows great respect and enthusiasm for the animals, their habitats, and the humans surrounding them and manages to do some pretty crazy and amazing things without focusing on doing things that are life threatening or too stunt-like. Fun and informative for the entire family.",1393632000,2,641,4.944444444444445

2986759,1,B000WMFZJ2,"Unfortunately a great idea but poorly launched. Here technology fails to meet Amazon's concept. Watched the first few minutes of the Jeff Corwin ""A Wild Man in Borneo"" video on a Mac book Pro 17 on a very high bandwidth 30 megabit network in my home.  The video quality on anything other than a small 6 inch by 4 inch windowed display is very pixellated, very blocky, and not viewable at more than your nose at 10 inches from the display. Worse yet if one expands it to full screen then the video detail is decimated. Suggestion to Amazon would be to launch the concept when technology supports the concept.  Maybe Amazon fails to understand video quality selection criteria, but I would expect the first video segment choices to meet at least a minimum quality resolution, and be vetted appropriately at launch.  This is very basic business acumen and not rocket science. As a shareholder of Amazon stock I'm not sure if I am more disappointed in the lack of required investment, lack of planning, or inadequate launch consideration as a long term Amazon Prime customer. Hmmm... I guess too bad for all of the above.  If this improves I will gladly adjust my initial review comments.

He also consistently works in eco-friendly messages and talks about having respect for nature, about leaving wild animals alone (especially dangerous ones) and about the need to protect habitat, etc. On the down side, you get a nagging feeling that there's a lot of information that is being left out, and that the mini-lectures Corwin delivers while, say, holding the deadliest viper in Central America, might not be as thorough as it might otherwise be. Corwin is sensitive to how much each animal is willing to put up with, and once he drops the animal back into the wild, the encounter (and the lecture) is over with. Also, his hands-on approach seems pretty invasive -- even though he often is taking part in scientific studies (tagging animals, etc.) and takes great pains to explain that what he is doing has been officially sanctioned, the overall effect may be to encourage audience members to mess about with wild animals themselves, which may have unfortunate consequences.

On balance, though, the show is informative and fun: one of the most amusing aspects is how totally into snakes Corwin is. So, if you like to see rare and deadly and beautiful serpents, this is definitely the show for you! There are plenty of mammals and birds, too, but Corwin does love the creepy crawlies. Overall this is a fun show, definitely worth checking out. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain kid's reviews)",1211241600,,2229,4.894179894179894
3221121,5,B000WMFZJ2,Jeff Corwin is a great host! He is in my opinion one of the best ones out there and it is a shame he isn't hosting any more shows. My kids absolutely love watching this DVD because of all the information in it and all of the humor Jeff puts behind all his information.,1404518400,,268,3.9814814814814814
3221122,5,B000WMFZJ2,"I think my 9-yr.-old son has decided he wants to be Jeff Corwin when he grows up. Corwin has a major fascination and love for not only snakes but also all wildlife. He is always so excited and enthusiastic about his wildlife encounters (and some of that wildlife is of the two-legged variety). Unlike some other wildlife shows with main characters like this, Corwin shows great respect and enthusiasm for the animals, their habitats, and the humans surrounding them and manages to do some pretty crazy and amazing things without focusing on doing things that are life threatening or too stunt-like. Fun and informative for the entire family.",1393632000,2,641,4.944444444444445

I don't feel like my eyes have to be glued to the TV the whole time this is on. I gave it four stars because I like it, but again, its not something I'm really going to focus my attention on for an hour.

3221256,1,B000WMFZJ2,"Unfortunately a great idea but poorly launched. Here technology fails to meet Amazon's concept. Watched the first few minutes of the Jeff Corwin ""A Wild Man in Borneo"" video on a Mac book Pro 17 on a very high bandwidth 30 megabit network in my home.  The video quality on anything other than a small 6 inch by 4 inch windowed display is very pixellated, very blocky, and not viewable at more than your nose at 10 inches from the display. Worse yet if one expands it to full screen then the video detail is decimated. Suggestion to Amazon would be to launch the concept when technology supports the concept.  Maybe Amazon fails to understand video quality selection criteria, but I would expect the first video segment choices to meet at least a minimum quality resolution, and be vetted appropriately at launch.  This is very basic business acumen and not rocket science. As a shareholder of Amazon stock I'm not sure if I am more disappointed in the lack of required investment, lack of planning, or inadequate launch consideration as a long term Amazon Prime customer. Hmmm... I guess too bad for all of the above.  If this improves I will gladly adjust my initial review comments.  Hoping this is simply a new launch challenge to be resolved quickly.",1331769600,2,1254,4.707762557077626
