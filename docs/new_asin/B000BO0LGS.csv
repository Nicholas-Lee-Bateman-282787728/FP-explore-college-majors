8089783,1,B000BO0LGS,"One of the worst films on Lifetime. While this movie does deserve its props for attempting to bring up the issue of rape and tell what is marketed as a true life story in film, it is ruined by this movie. The acting is by far the worst, even for a 90s movie, even for a low-budget Lifetime movie. Paula Abdul deserves credit for trying to act and making a bold choice of portraying a rape victim as her first acting gig, but that does not excuse what is ultimately a job not well-done. Her acting quite frankly was laughable. The only thing she actually did well in this movie was slap Adrian Pasdar at the end. The blame on Paula for ruining this film is only lessened by the fact that it was also the material that she had to work with that made it that much worse. The writing was terrible, the costuming, hair, make-up, cinematography, sound-editing and the choice of music and uses of music throughout the film, helped to make what should have been a great and powerful film into something ridiculous that only wishes it could even be close to calling itself ""film"". The lighting and use of cameras and sets were alright; no big problems there. This was the first film that I saw Adrian Pasdar in. I feel sorry for him. He truly did his best with material and other ""actors"" he had to work with. His performance was believable and kept me from watching other things he was in because I was so disturbed. His portrayal of emotional copycatting (feigning emotion) and lack of caring was believable. His hair style was awful as was his wardrobe. It wasn't the subject: it was the way the film was executed that made it so poor. I hope Lifetime does not continue to play this film on any of its networks.",1301702400,,1705,4.39873417721519
8089784,5,B000BO0LGS,"I really loved this movie, Paula is fantastic in it, and she's a totally believale character; she definitely made the movie. I think this is a must for all Paula fans, even if the first 10 minutes are a bit uncomfortable!",1167350400,3,221,4.414634146341464
8089785,2,B000BO0LGS,"After viewing Paula Abdul's amateurish performance in this made for TV movie, one can see why she didn't have a very long acting career.  Even her buddy Simon Callow would have to agree.  Supposedly based on ""actual events,"" this lethargic movie gives us Abdul as a rape victim trying to get her life back together.  She's a business entrepreneur who wants to invest her hundred thousand dollars into some kind of business.  She is guided by her business manager, Susan Ruttan, whose performance belies the fact that she was Emmy nominated when on LA LAW.  She also befriends a cute condo neighbor, played by Tracy Nelson.  Life takes a good turn .. or does it when she meets handsome car detailer Adrian Pasdar, who may just be the man to help her shake her fear and terror.  A 12 year old can see the obvious in this okay little thriller, but it's only Pasdar in his role that brings any sense of credibility to the movie.",1151020800,,924,4.530120481927711
8089786,4,B000BO0LGS,Some people say Paula's acting was not great in this movie but I found her totally believable.  The only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was the rather poor script and dialogue.  You wouldn't think being based on a true story writing a good script would be as hard as starting from scratch but you'd be wrong...  Paula and the supporting cast manage to make this well worth the price despite the material they had to work with.,1133308800,5,435,4.4125
