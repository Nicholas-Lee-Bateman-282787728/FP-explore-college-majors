8506482,5,B0042XT7FK,"The quality is great.  There's an English and an Italilan audio track, as well as English and Italian subtitles (which can be turned off).  Only in the first episode where there were a few scenes where someone spoke in Mandarin and there were hard-coded Italian subtitles did I not understand what was happening.  So, whether you speak/read English or Italian, you should be pleased.  I just wish that subsequent seasons would become more readily available.  It's a great show, and this was an excellent season.",1365120000,2,511,4.964705882352941
