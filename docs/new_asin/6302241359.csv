7822787,4,6302241359,"""Body Rock"" is absolutely impossible to rate except as an unplanned comedy full of the cultural excesses of 1984. On that basis it deserves four stars, losing one solely for the incredible irritation the tiringly repetitive soundtrack brings. The case advertises it as ""the funky-fresh king of '80s breakdance epics!"" What an understatement. This movie is hilarious, although in fairness it is frequently visually painful to watch. It stars Lorenzo Lamas as Chilly-D as a rapping graffiti artist who heads New York's ""Body Rock Crew"" of breakdancers. In other words, the film combines three things I hate and makes into one that is impossible not to laugh at.

Fashion excesses abound, and scenes that are now actually solemn for reasons impossible to foresee in 1984 (Lamas breakdances between the World Trade Center towers) are intermingled with a ponderous background story, romance, fables about the evils of money in the entertainment industry, and over-the-top interpersonal drama to create a breakdancing film that has no peer. Thankfully.

Chilly's primitive rapping and the ridiculous fad of breakdancing are treated deadly seriously by director Marcelo Epstein, and the sets and costumes are definitely a cultural trip back in time. My favorite scene is the blacklight dance number featuring numerous red skeletons that I can only describe as being an unholy alliance of the ""Thriller"" video and the ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers."" If this scene doesn't make you laugh, check for a pulse. Of course, Chilly, being so incredibly awesome, gets singled out for solo fame and this leads to much of the conflict in the film. Chilly gets a big head and messes up everything he had worked so hard for (note he's constantly wearing ""Chilly"" shirts and jackets...yes, he's just that cool.) Other fashion missteps include a dollop of berets and a slathering of headbands. Chilly's ego goes unchecked (he wants Eddie Van Halen and Ringo to play on his debut album) and the falling out is epic, as is the stirring conclusion (I have never seen a show crashed quite this way.)

If you don't think (perhaps wisely) you can make it all the way through the movie in one sitting, you have two options. The first is to do what I did which is to watch the film in bits and pieces over an extended time period. In my case I started it over a year ago and finished it this afternoon. (Really.) The other option is to watch the only extra on the disc, the trailer, which hits the highlights and saves you about 90 minutes of your life. I really don't hate ""Body Rock"" as such, but understanding that it's only entertaining as a piece of cinematic cheese leftover from one of the gaudiest decades in history is key to enjoying it.",1350086400,7,2717,4.863930885529157
7822788,5,6302241359,"1984 seemed to be the year of the break dance/rap film. Body Rock was one that went less noticed, however it captured a magical time in NYC. The cinematography is extremely good for such a low budget picture. It's also well choreographed and some of the sets are quite elaborate all things considered. Also the soundtrack is quite diverse and eclectic. No award winning acting here, although Lorenzo Lamas does a decent job in the lead role. It is what it is, and for the most part exceeds expectations.",1302220800,4,503,4.662921348314606
7822789,1,6302241359,Body Rock is the 2nd worst movie I have ever seen coming in right behind Meatballs 2. Lorenzo Lamas must wish everyday that this one would disappear. Dreadful movie.,1252886400,,165,4.724137931034483
