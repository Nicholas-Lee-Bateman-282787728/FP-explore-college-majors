8414799,5,B000EAVAUU,"""The Deep Horizon"" contains some outstanding footage of the U.S. Navy's amazing DSRV submersibles, as well as the Aluminaut.  There's also a terrific film on this DVD showing how the Navy salvages a sunken submarine.  What I think is really amazing however are the films showing the SeaLab I and II missions.  These often-overlooked inner space habitats on the bottom of the sea were major accomplishments for this country, perhaps ranking up there with our accomplishments in outer space.  It's neat to see such terrific footage and to learn more about this country's efforts in deep sea exploration.  Too bad that as a nation we no longer probe the sea or subsidize these types of bold ventures -- the government has abandoned the sea to private enterprise.",1142899200,,759,4.94488188976378
8414800,5,B000EAVAUU,"If you grew up in the 1960's you might have put a poster of Apollo 11 on the wall.  Some of us however aspired to see another frontier -- right below the waves!  The U.S. Navy in the 1960's was very much dedicated to exploring the deep and while many of the things that were done in that era are classified, some bold ventures were well publicized.  On this DVD you'll see films of two of the more interesting adventures, SeaLab I and II.  Both were pioneering undersea laboratories which perfected techniques still used today for human exploration of the deep sea.  Some of it, such as breathing gas mixtures, enabled SEALs and spooks to accomplish missions you and I can only dream about.  It's neat to see how men learned to live at incredible depths, and especially to see footage of Scott Carpenter, a Navy poster boy who became an astronaut, aboard SeaLab.  He set an endurance record and one of the funniest things you'll see / hear, he speaks to President Nixon with a high-pitched voice (due to breathing helium at pressure). Many of us really wish the government had not so quickly abandoned this kind of research, although nowadays what you're seeing are a lot of commercial companies doing this type of cutting edge stuff -- and doing a heck of a lot of impressive things with robots (they do far better than humans past 100 feet!)  Okay, also on this DVD is an amazing film about the capabilities of the DSRV, the Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle which was the subject of the fictional movie ""Gray Lady Down"".  We never had to use the DSRV for a real rescue thank God, but just knowing they were there was a big psychological help for us submariners.  The last of the two DSRVs is just about to get replaced with a new craft, so this is of real historical interest.  Another film on the DVD shows divers and Navy engineers at work trying to retrieve a submarine that has sunk. This is quite an interesting film although nowadays I am certain the techniques used would be much different -- since even the smallest attack submarines in our Navy are vast compared to the WWII fleet boat seen here.  Still this gives real insight into how they retrieved the Squalus -- and I had no idea how complicated or potentially dangerous it really is/was till I saw this film.  The last thing on this DVD is a film about the Aluminaut, which was a submersible built by the same people that make Reynolds aluminum foil.  It had a very short career but part of that included something pretty amazing -- helping the Alvin retrieve a lost atomic bomb off the coast of Palomares, Spain.  That incident is not seen on this DVD but you get a good sense of the little craft's capabilities.  I understand the vessel is now on display in Virginia at a science museum.  Just to wrap up, these are beautiful color films and all well worth seeing.  They make this old salt want to take scuba diving lessons in fact...",1140480000,,2902,4.505725190839694
