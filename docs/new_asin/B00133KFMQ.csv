With the exception of the Turkish Dance, which was over edited, all of Hilary's performances were complete dances that were smooth and enjoyable to watch.  Never having the opportunity to travel abroad, I especially enjoyed watching the various middle eastern and scottish cultures scenic highlights that were incorporated into this video. Very professional video and I would recommend buying.",1208476800,9,487,5.394736842105263
