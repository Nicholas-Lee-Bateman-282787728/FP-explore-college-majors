8111528,5,B000EMSXBM,Just like all other mexican movies of Maria Felix; you can find them with Amazon and in the original clear picture.  This is also a great movie for the entire family.  We recommend this movie to all of you.,1292803200,,206,4.256410256410256
8111529,5,B000EMSXBM,"If you like classic melodrama, this is a good one.  Mara Flix was the diva of her day; I'd characterize her as Joan Crawford meets Bette Davis in Spanish.  In this film she becomes ""Lady Devil"" after her husband betrays her and she takes her revenge by becoming an exploiter of men.  But the unexpected arrival of her daughter complicates her plans.  Thoroughly enjoyable if you like this sort of thing.  Just know there are no subtitles; knowing the Spanish language is a requirement.",1259280000,,485,4.726190476190476
8111530,1,B000EMSXBM,"I am being waiting for this movie and at this time (almost two month) I don't have received it.  Please. I need information about this.
