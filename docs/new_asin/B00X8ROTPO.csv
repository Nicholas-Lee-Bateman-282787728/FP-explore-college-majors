7166640,3,B00X8ROTPO,"Toolbox Murders 2 is a sequel to the Tobe Hooper directed Toolbox Murders which itself is a remake of an older film. It however is a very different kind of film then the first, other then the main killer they don't really have much in common, not even tone. This one is more similar to Saw or Hostel. First of all, the acting is not going to be anything special but its passible for what it is, a low budget horror. Some things also could've been explained better or even at all but lets be honest, us horror fans don't really watch these types of films for their engaging stories. The gore has also been cranked up from the first film, there is ALOT of it in here. Most is very well done also. Gotta take a minute to also talk about the music, which in certain scenes I feel is very well done. If you are the type of person that doesn't like lots of violence or heavy gore then stay away from this as it has lots of it. If however you enjoy films like the Saw series this may just be for you. Basic plot is the killer Coffin Baby, kidnaps a woman whos the sister of a girl he killed in the first movie, keeps her captive & forces her to watch as he does brutal things to people he brings in.

I was not a fan of the original Toolbox Murders but enjoyed Hooper's remake very much. That said, while this one isn't as good as the first one this follows, as a horror fan I did find it enjoyable & don't regret my purchase at all. The ending could've been done a bit better but they're supposed to be working on a 3rd so that may be the reason for it.",1439164800,4,1547,4.039087947882736
7166641,2,B00X8ROTPO,"If you like gore in your horror movies, then you might like this movie.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.  Poor story line that is dragged out to 80 minutes, making most of the movie unnecessary and confusing as why a victim would waste so much time as she is  trying to escape.  So many goofs (aka errors) in this movie to even list.  The main character keeps flipping back and forth from weak damsel to vengeful bitch and she cuts off the wrong hand of the decoy.  If interested in the movie, just watch the trailer and save yourself the agony of disappointment.
 The movie should have gone by a different title and not been connected to Tobe Hooper's Toolbox Murders, which is I highly recommend to horror fans.",1439078400,,715,4.496124031007752
7166642,1,B00X8ROTPO,This movie was so God awful I can't believe I am wasting time to even post about it. No plot or correlation to what it is supposed to be a sequel to. The main girl is such a bad actress she should give up after this trainwreck and save herself some further embarrassment. Nothing at all to recommend here. Awful awful movie.,1439078400,2,324,4.241935483870968
7166643,1,B00X8ROTPO,"I'm a total horror buff, and the original toolbox murders by Tobe hooper has always been in my top 10. I was excited when I saw this ""sequel."" I wish I'd read the reviews first. This has absolutely nothing to do with the first movie other than deceitfully ripping off its title. Insulting acting, grossly stupid special effects and no plot to speak of. Thanks for wasting my time and money. Tobe Hooper, I would sue if I were you!",1438992000,3,430,4.3875

7166645,1,B00X8ROTPO,"I loved the original remake of the Toolbox Murders from 2004 directed by Tobe Hooper, but this sequel is just god awful i am a horror buff to the max and after watching this i felt like i actually wasted my time and that is difficult to do to someone like me who has seen pretty much every horror movie made this movie is just an insult to the original so AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1438560000,3,375,4.013333333333334
7166646,1,B00X8ROTPO,"I loved Tobe Hooper's Toolbox Murders.  It had interesting and gruesome murders but also had a plot, interesting characters, a good detective story, a neat supernatural twist, and a cool ""monster.""  I wanted a sequel which would delve deeper into the coffin baby and flesh out the story more.  What I got was an over the top gory and violent movie with no plot.  It is just gore and violence for the sake of gore and violence.  There is no further insight to the coffin baby, no characters worth caring about, and it looks like the whole thing was shot in a warehouse for $200.  There are two mysteries: how did they get Bruce Dern to do this and who invested the $200?",1343865600,4,669,4.3983739837398375

7166652,2,B00X8ROTPO,"Based on a true story: ""Coffin Baby"" couldn't sell no matter how often they released it under that title.

***May contain plot spoilers, if I understand the plot****

This is an odd slasher film. It starts with unsolved gruesome Hollywood murders in 1958. It jumps to the present with some more gruesome murders and Samantha (Chauntal Lewis) being taken prisoner and tortured by the man who just killed her sister (Allison Kyler). More gruesome murders go on as the cops are baffled. We see the killer, a man's whose face is wrapped in bandages, a huge man with a long black coat, home-made ski mask, a tool box, and slow swagger music.

The film is filled with blood and gore. The plot is not really explained, and the film wasn't that good to pay close attention. There is a supernatural element involved, and yes there is a dead baby in a coffin, who apparently is the killer, which was another WTF scene. Needless to say, I am not sure I got it and the film wasn't good enough for me to want to get it, because then I might be tempted to watch some blood and gore sequel about a dead baby avenging angel or whatever he was.

If blood and gore are your thing, then you might like this film and tell me what you think. 2 stars is generous, I liked the short skirts.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, N-word. No sex or nudity. Leggy girl in thong. Plenty of blood, gore, knife cutting, mutilation, etc. Enough to make Hannibal cringe.",1443744000,,1427,4.452107279693487
7166653,1,B00X8ROTPO,"this movie is so bad ! Not at all like the first that was very good and the plot was interesting, not recommend at all, wish this movie was never created!!!",1441411200,,156,4.064516129032258
7166654,1,B00X8ROTPO,"This movie is bad, there is no plot and the acting is not very good except for Bruce Dern who is barley in it. I can only assume that there was some creative issues or interference Between producers and director as the end result is completely incoherent and repetitive. It is extremely gory and the effects start out ok but soon become pretty lousy and after a while the only thing the movie has to offer is its over the top violence. I didn't get the connection to Tobe Hoopers movie but do yourself a favor and just watch that one again or the original from the 70's as either one would be a better use of your time.",1441152000,,619,4.2100840336134455

7166656,3,B00X8ROTPO,"Toolbox Murders 2 is finally here! It was once called Coffin Baby in other countries. It's the sequel to the remake by Tobe Hooper. The Shout! release is so different compared to the old Coffin Baby cut. I actually prefer the other version. I found it to be a better movie all around and better music. It had different scenes and a better ending too I think. TBM2 was not bad though, but I was not a fan of the way the story went in this one. It's pretty nasty at times too. Some very gruesome moments and some great special effects. I would say it's worth watching if you liked the remake. TBM2 cut I would give 3/5 I would give the Coffin Baby cut a 4/5. If you can find Coffin Baby though, I would recommend that version over TBM2. Shame they didn't have both cuts on the bluray. No extras either but a trailer on this release. I was hoping for a bit more in this tool box. I'm glad it's been released though. I heard they are already working on part 3. So that's good news for horror fans.

If your interested in seeing the Coffin Baby version, it's available on dvd/bluray in Germany and other countries. I've heard the German steelbook is the best version to get. You will need a region free dvd/bluray player though to watch it.",1440028800,3,1235,4.277777777777778
8715419,1,B00X8ROTPO,"Acting on par with Tommy Wiseau's The Room, cheap special fx, non-existent story line. Don't bother wasting your time with this bottom of the barrel garbage. Not even entertaining in a ""so bad it's good"" way just downright aggrivating.",1534636800,,235,5.051282051282051
8715420,1,B00X8ROTPO,"This movie managed to be boring, pretentious, gruesome and disturbing all at the same time.  Emphasis on boring and pretentious.  Incredibly bad acting from everyone, especially the leading lady.  Several scenes were of the eye-rolling variety, such as when the police allows said leading lady to tromp all over the crime scene of her sister.

Also, Bruce Dern must have lost a bet.",1498003200,,382,5.015873015873016

8715426,3,B00X8ROTPO,"Honestly,i saw the bad reviews & didn't look into it too much cuz everyones opinion is their own. Granted i enjoyed the first film & the original but this was just odd. The story picks up with the sister escaping from the first film being killed & he steals her sister. Next thing ya know she is left to watch tortures upon tortures unfold in front of her,in a cage. There is good gore and such but the story isn't really there,there is no real dumbness but not a real story at all. Just gore & the days pass away until she loses her mind completely. I really don't know what else to say,if you like gore and just wanna give it a shot you will probably dig it id you enjoyed the original or remake. It's worth a shot. I got it for a penny + shipping. Gorehounds enjoy.",1464307200,5,768,4.126666666666667
8715427,1,B00X8ROTPO,"I'll start off by saying I liked TBM (reboot/re-imagine) 1, it was a fun, down-and-dirty shocker/gore romp effectively directed by genre legend Tobe Hooper. This follow-up is a ponderous, incoherent mess of a film. The killer from 1 imprisons and tortures a bunch of people somewhere, for some reason. Disinterested-looking Academy Award winner Bruce Dern shows up long enough to phone in a 5 minute performance and, presumably, fire his agent. Things get inexplicably supernatural and we gradually stumble into a vague, unresolved ending that leaves the door open for (surprise!) another sequel. It appears most of the budget went into the Se7en/Dawn of the Dead remake-style opening credits sequence, which might have been kind-of impressive in the mid/late 1990s (complete with era-appropriate generic industrial musical accompaniment). This may be worth a look for hardcore gore-heads, but probably not (the effects, while practical and plentiful, look pretty cheap to me). Instead of wasting your time on this train wreck seek out the 1978 source material, it's equally pointless but at least provides the joy of watching Cameron Mitchell run amok and chew scenery.",1455148800,3,1170,5.398907103825136
8715428,1,B00X8ROTPO,"Low budget, set piece gore, bad acting even for a horror movie, poor plot of a woman being kidnapped by a serial killer who tourtures her first then plays with her..example, he starves her in the begining just to turn around and feed her popcorn, water, and human body parts he is frying in a pan? yet he is a disfigured lunatic..smh lol",1454198400,,337,4.365079365079365
