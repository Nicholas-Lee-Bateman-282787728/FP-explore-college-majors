8214287,2,B000UPEPWY,"Steve may be a great gunsmith and R92 expert, but he's a horrible filmographer.  The video was taken on old equipment, and is highly pixelated on newer TV's.  This is important since there's many parts where you need to see detail on the firearm parts.  One particularly infuriating part is trying to see the grind angles and amounts on the bolt.  The camera keeps going in and out of focus, and makes it nearly impossible to closely inspect his bolt.  Additionally, his big fingers get in the way when trying to see how small parts fit.  There are better videos on youtube.  In fact, once I got the gist of what modifications he recommended, I shut his video off, and went to youtube to watch higher quality videos on the actual process.",1399334400,,738,4.545454545454546
8214288,5,B000UPEPWY,"I DID IT! I was a bit anxious, tearing this rifle down to its component parts. The tearing it down part I was pretty sure I could do, but then would I ever get this pile of parts back into anything that even looked like a rifle.

The video was clear and I could follow it. A few of the steps looked easier than they turned out to be, experience does count. I did manage to launch the ejector spring across the room which entailed a break while I found it.

I am confortable enough with this that I am doing it again with my second Rossi 92. Try it, you will be sucessfull (but get out your swear word dictionary for when thing just don't want to fit).",1360281600,2,651,4.038759689922481
8214289,4,B000UPEPWY,"I purchased a used 92 and it had a terrible action.  I purchased the springs and the video.  Video is complete and detailed to the point of ANYBODY can do this, IF YOU HAVE the tools.  I took it in steps and cleaned the carbine.  THAT fixed the problem so I have decided NOT to go forward.  The video tells you in detail how to disassemble the rifle/carbine and that alone is worth the price.",1356652800,2,392,4.173333333333333
8214290,5,B000UPEPWY,After I got the DVD I was able to follow Steve's instructions and now gun isn't as stiff as when I first got it.  I think Steve did an excellent job on the DVD.,1266796800,5,160,3.7058823529411766
8214291,1,B000UPEPWY,Can we say price gouging here?  Do a Google for Steve's Gunz and order direct from the producer.  I having nothing against Amazon but do object to associates that try to rip off the public.,1243555200,5,189,4.371428571428571
