They were populated by the elite who would go on to run companies or into political service. They did not encourage diversity in thought or student population. If anything, they did the oppisite and encouraged the maintaining of the status quo.

Of course, today universities serve a far different purpose. Most of the left with and ""radical"" new thinking come from our universities - where exploring the differences of opinion that can emerge from study are encouraged?

How did this monumental shift in the role universities play in our society come about?

The footage on this DVD set does a fairly good job of answering that question with a series of films that take you from university life in the 1950s to the great shift that occcured during the 1960s.

One of the biggest changes was that women and minorities were brought into the arena of higher learning and with them they brought new ideas and ways of thinking.

The other shift was the radicalization of college students - which is documented fairly well here in a clip about student riots at Columbia University.

What made me interested in these films is the subtle way they bring you from one way of looking at university life to another and let you see how this was not a thunderstorm, but rather a slow glacial change that left our society profoundly different.",1164672000,2,1486,4.853754940711463

When I watched this DVD I realized that it has not always been like that. I was appalled (in a good way) by the clips that showed women either not being allowed into college or else forced to take cooking clases.

The clips that show black people entering white colleges for the first time are also disturbing and educational.

There are some other clips later on about university revolts that didn't have the same impact on me personally (though I can see why they might be more interesting to someone who wasn't looking at this for the diversity issues.)

This DVD does a good job of putting modern college life in perspective.",1146096000,3,778,4.615942028985507
