4049730,4,B0031REQJ0,"My 6 year old has enjoyed most of the Barbie movies, including this newest offering.  This is very much like all the rest, except as my 9 year old (who sat through it semi-interested several times) pointed out...there are no ""boys.""  Wow! That's huge...every other Barbie movie has at least partially centered around a male character helping to solve the problem/save the kingdom.  Besides a brief appearance by her kindly/wacky surfer dude grandfather, it's all girl power in this one.  Pretty refreshing really!",1269561600,9,513,5.144578313253012
4049731,5,B0031REQJ0,"I admit, endless churning out of Barbie movies every 6-8 months is a bit much. I could take them or leave them; the animation is cute, the story is harmless and of course there's lots of Barbie and her friends movie tie-in merchandise for your Barbie lover. That being said, my 7 year old daughter loves this movie. She enjoys dancing to the songs and has asked to watch it over and over. The good guys win in the end and the evil queen is scary, but not *too* scary. The story has a nice message about how it's ok to be different and unlike many other movies, the title character isn't waiting around for a prince to rescue her and save the day. As I'm not the target audience, I'll give it the five stars and two enthusiastic thumbs up my daughter emphatically states that it deserves.",1269475200,7,787,4.324324324324325
4049732,5,B0031REQJ0,"Our three and a half year old daughter wanted to see this movie after seeing a preview on the Nick Jr website.  The only other Barbie movie we have watched was the Nutcracker, and while it was a cute movie with beautiful ballet sequences, it had too many scary parts for her.  We watched A Mermaid's Tale tonight as a special treat after a particularly traumatic day involving blood testing for allergies.  I was pleasantly surprised in this movie.  The  animation is fantastic, beautiful and lifelike.  The characters are sweet.  And the story line (you must realize we are talking it's for small children who love Barbie and fantasy) is easy to follow and fun.  My daughter loved it.  The ""scary"" parts weren't too scary, some sharks, a few jelly fish, and the mean Queen.  And while she is mean, it's nothing like the Queen in Sleeping Beauty that can give very young children nightmares for weeks.  The movie's message is that it is okay to be different.  We are very particular about what we let our daughter watch.  She watches Max and Ruby, the Wonder Pets, The Berenstain Bears, Little Bear, Olivia and occasionally Maggie and the Ferocious Beast.  She has seen the Tinkerbell movies, but didn't enjoy the other Disney movies, as the bad guys are always too scary.  She doesn't see any network TV or commercials in general. She saw the commercial for this on the Nick Jr website, and only after we had watched it first.  My husband and I especially appreciated the fact that there weren't references to things she wouldn't understand, there weren't jokes thrown in for the adults only, and that is was sweet and simple with no violence, no name calling and nothing offensive.  I would gladly watch it again with her, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a parent who was looking for a sweet, fun movie for little girls who love pretend and make-believe and believe it's possible Mermaids are really out there in the ocean somewhere.",1268611200,84,1946,4.6932153392330385
4049733,5,B0031REQJ0,"Okay, everybody knows we're not dealing with Pixar here. I suspect Barbie movies are churned out of some nondescript factory in New Jersey (though I have yet to confirm those suspicions). But be that as it may, we accept Barbie movies for what they are: pleasant and relatively wholesome vehicles for selling products and offering parents a 1 and a 1/2 hour reprieve from the bedlam created by young girls. With that intro, here is my eight year old's review (as dictated to me):

""This movie is an enjoyable, unforgettable adventure. It is one of the best movies with fantasy. It has a great story and animation. This movie is a delightful film to watch.""",1268611200,29,656,4.7043478260869565
4049734,3,B0031REQJ0,"I bought this the day it came out, and watched it with some of my younger little friends, ages 5-8. If I went by them, it'd be a 'Fish-A-Licious' 5 stars. However, I don't completely agree.
The storyline is a bit of a twist on the same old Kingdom-owning-craze that Barbie movies have become infamous for. This time, evil in the form of Eris, the good queen's sister, reigns. Eris stole the throne from Calissa, and it's the good guys (er, girls) trying to restore peace and happiness. Merliah Summers is ex-Queen Calissa's daughter, and a champion surfer. When she 'comes of age' and discovers she's part mermaid, she dives into the sea to try and find the mother she's never known, help Calissa, and hopefully get back her 'normal' self.
This one is decidedly more modern, the conversations are a little more mature, and yet some parts are even more juvenile. There is talk of Merliah's dad, who died in an accident, and Calissa's pregnacy and the oddity of mermaids marrying humans. None of it is overt or uncomfortable, but it's little changes like this that help balance out the more childish elements. Merliah acts like a brat, smarting off to her grandfather, being rude to Zuma and her friends, and talking a little too much about herself. However, in the the end, it turns out she's acting like this because she feels like a misfit and a freak. Her mother proceeds to tell her, ""You're unique. These differences don't make you bad, but special in your own way."" The animation isn't nearly as high quality as the others, but as far as I've seen, there haven't been any huge flaws. The underwater motions were well animated, and the surfing scenes were excellent. The music is modern and really fun. There are tons of cute mer-oriented words and catch phrases thrown in, such as ""Bloomingtail's"" ""Seaphora"" as well as songs like ""Swimmin' on Sunshine."" My biggest problem was the phsycic Destinies, whose faces go blank, eyes facant, and bodies glowing when they forsee the future. That, and the gleeful exclamtion of, ""You're Merliah's Spirit Guide!"" from Hadley left a bitter taste in my mouth, thinking, ""How am I gonna explain to these little girls that dabbling in spirit-fortune telling and phsycadelic glowing mermaids are wrong????""

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie. It was lots of fun, sweet, and bright colors. Cute, but not great. Enjoyable, but not one of the ones I'd watch over and over again. I would say ""Barbie's Worst!"" but that's a little too drastic. It's not too mature for girls to swallow, and yet it's got a little more 'salt' thrown in for older viewers. I wish, though, that Barbie would return to the more classic princess style of movies. The Three Musketeers was great, with a good storyline and plain, girl-power wholesome fun, where all the girls shone-not just Barbie. The upcoming movie, Barbie in a Fashion Fairytale, looks to be utterly ridiculous. Barbie looks awful, and the plot seems bland. ""Will Barbie and her dog Sequin find their inner Sparkle?!?"" Whoopee. Tell me this isn't the direction Barbie's moving in! Go back to classical music and princesses if that's what it takes, Barbie!",1268611200,39,3143,4.7988929889298895
4049735,5,B0031REQJ0,"My daughter saw the ads on tv for this and couldn't wait for it to come out. She loved it and absolutely loves dancing around to the songs.

This story is about a girl (Merliah) raised by her grandfather who discovers she's half-mermaid on her sixteenth birthday. It turns out that her mermaid aunt has been keeping her mother prisoner, and Merliah has to rescue her and come to terms with her mermaid heritage.

Eris, the villian, is a bit flat of a character.  In defeating Eris, Barbie is reunited with Mom, Queen Callisa.  Some cute underwater jokes and good scenery.  Not the best Barbie movie though.  If your kids like mermaids, it's good.

4050051,5,B0031REQJ0,"What I like most about this movie is how they really took the Barbie 'rolemodel' aspect and did more. It truly is about a girl having to be true to herself and making tough decisions and finding her way in the world. The message is positive and well done to even the younger girls understand it. Our daughter first watched this movie at age 5 and she got the message very well. She also enjoys the music.

If you are looking for movies such as this one for a 5-7 y/o girl, this one does a great job. Ones to avoid in this genre or Barbie franchise would be Princess and the Popstar... message is too subtle for little kids, music is decent though.",1348963200,,647,4.217741935483871

There's sports, cheering, dancing, singing, and quick-thinking, both above and below sea-level.  If you want a Barbie movie for your little one that doesn't grate your nerves too much to hear it in the background while it's being played for the 10th consecutive time, this is a good choice.",1343952000,,443,4.653846153846154
4050053,5,B0031REQJ0,"I love this movie. In some ways it reminds me of ""The tale of Emily Windsnap"" by Liz Kessler, which is a book for ages 8 and up about a twelve year old girl who discovers she is half-mermaid. Meliah is reluctant at first when she finds out the truth and about her destiney to stop her evil aunt. However, she comes to realize that there is something bigger than herself to fight for. Meliah realizes that it would be wrong to gain her own happiness at the expense of the well-being of others. She takes responsibility and stands up for what is right. This is a very cute movie. Fans of Sailor Moon, Barbie movies, and Mermaid Melody will enjoy this movie. It is similar to Sailor Moon because it centers on a girl who discovers that she is a princess and has a destiney to save her kingdom from an evil soceress. It also reminds me a little of Balto 2 Wolf Quest because like Aleu, Meliah discovers a secret behind her herritage. Aleu had to come to accept that she is part wolf, just like Meliah had to come to accept that she is part mermaid. Both heroines realize that there is something greater than their own desires and others around them that need them. I recomend it if you love fantasy, mermaid stories, and stories of reluctant heroines. THis is a positive movie for girls, it has themes of bavery and friendship. This movie could appeal to tomboys because Meliah's character is more atheletic than prissy.

There is no romance in this princess story which is what makes it different from most princess stories.",1343779200,,1521,4.471223021582734

We have watched others (Barbie movies) since then but this is my favorite. I have actually sat through it a couple of times. There is a small scary part that didn't really bother my daughter and I liked that there wasn't a lot of romance/boyfriend/etc. I found it appropriate for my 4 year old but older viewers would enjoy it as well.,1327276800,,465,4.235955056179775

4050080,2,B0031REQJ0,"Well, I'm a dad, my two daughters (6 and 8) like this stuff and it's harmless for the most part.  I'm all for the girl power stuff that barbie movies have but, the supporting characters are usually pretty shallow and one dimensional.  As far as animation and plot, if you've seen one barbie movie you've seen them all.  They reuse the boy characters and villainesses shamelessly (which is ok since my kids are little and don't notice)but it makes for a pretty boring movie from the adult point of view.  I will stress that my girls really like them fine.

My complaint, is that there are a lot of other movies for kids that I actually enjoy watching with them.  I will watch any disney princess movie repeatedly for the animation and the characters.  I really like most of the pixar movies for the same reason.  I've probably watched Nemo 40 times and still like watching it with the kids.

So, if you're just going to put something on the TV for the kids and walk away this will do the trick.  But if you actually want to hang out with your kids and watch too then this is better as a one-time rental.  I usually try to ""go make popcorn"" after about 5 minutes if my wife hasn't beaten me to it.",1323561600,,1195,4.313901345291479

4050082,2,B0031REQJ0,"As soon as I first saw this movie I felt like it was going downhill. They started to make the story more 'funky' and 'fashion' related. With buying tails and all. Also, Barbie doesn't even look the same anymore.
I'm a MASSIVE fan of the stories up to the Diamond Castle (didn't like the Thumbelina tail, thought it was ridiculous...didn't follow the Thumbelina plot at all! And also I did not like Christmas Carol and The Three Musketeeers)

I'm a HUGE fan of the traditional Barbie stories with great morals. (Rapunzel, Swan Lake...etc). Which I grew up with up and am now an adult. But seeing the huge change with the movies makes me really upset. Young girls aren't learning anything from these movies.

Even though Kelly Sheridan did voice Merliah, I was still horribly disappointed with how modern and hip they tried to make Barbie. The story was cute, but not the Barbie stories I know and love. The film had great animation as well.

This was the last tolerable Barbie movie I have watched and not completely cringed throughout it. After they replaced Kelly Sheridan it has gone completely 'PLASTIC' and 'SHALLOW' and just to market Barbie products",1322352000,2,1155,4.765

what bothers me the most are the shortcuts the animators took. they are glaringly obvious! all of the male and female characters in crowd scenes are exactly the same! did they feel they could skimp somewhere because the main characters hair and clothes moved for the first time?

I thought this movie would be really stupid; Barbie finds out she is half mermaid half human? Seriously? But somehow they make it work. The music is catchy, and my 2 year old sings it over and over.
The last movie they made using Kelly Sheridan as the classic voice of Barbie; if you buy Fashion Fairytale, you will hear some imposters voice.
Barbie shows girls they really can be what they want to be and acheive things that seem impossible!

4050113,5,B0031REQJ0,"I was so charmed by this silly little movie, after I watched it with my daughters (7yo & 4yo), I recommended it to surfing friends who have daughters, and then I went out and bought a copy for my family (I don't buy very many movies).  Merliah Summers is a surfing champion for what seems to be her Malibu highschool.  The details of where exactly they are surfing are a little confusing (is it Malibu or Mavericks? make up your mind, Barbie), but that's balanced by the fact that the man who does the announcer's voice is a real-live surfer!  I really appreciated that, my kids didn't care.  Merliah reaches some certain age and her body starts to change, which startles and upsets her (I think any adolescent girl can identify with THAT) - in Merliah's case, her hair turns pink, she can breathe underwater, and a dolphin talks to her.  Not QUITE what your average adolescent experiences!  I really appreciated the way this was handled:  Barbie and her friend (Fallon, I think) are cynics, the other friend (Hadley) completely buys the crazy story.  Of course, in real life Fallon would be right, but in this movie it turns out Hadley is right - Merliah is a mermaid!  and not just ANY mermaid, she's a mermaid princess!  with royal princessy duties!  (save the kingdom! defy her unpleasant aunt Eris! capture the magical items!)  At this point the movie gets really silly, and I get up and do something else while my daughters continue to enjoy it.  We all especially love the Queen of the Waves song/video.",1286841600,,1510,4.631578947368421
4050114,4,B0031REQJ0,"Mattel's latest entertainment for little girls is a sort of cross between the Aussie teenage mermaid TV series ""H2O"" (Link:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H20-Season-1-Volume-1/dp/B002AMUD62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H20 Season 1 Volume 1</a>) and the previous Barbie film ""Mermaidia, (Link: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-Mermaidia-DVD/dp/B000EMI5CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie - Mermaidia [DVD</a>]"") with a heroine who is a teenage surfing champion from Malibu.

Each of the Barbie DVD's which Mattel has put out for little girls (and other members of the family) seems to have been more beautifully made than the last, charming, and, if my daughter is anything to go by, can hold the attention of a little girl for hours. ""Barbie in A Mermaid Tale"" has most of the usual Barbie elements: a brave, feisty heroine (althought she is a bit less irritatingly perfect than in most of the previous films), cute talking animals (in this case dolphins and fish), wicked villainess, the most tenuous link to reality, etc, etc ...

The heroine, Merliah, has just turned 16: she has lived on Malibu with her hippie grandfather since an accident in which she was told that her parents died, and she is a fanatical surfer. At the start of the film Merliah is about to win a surfing championship when she is horrified to hear the announcer say that her hair has changed colour (which it has).

If she thought that was strange, what happens next freaks her out: a dolphin called Zuma appears, tells Merliah that her mother isn't dead at all, but is the rightful Queen of Oceana, and asks her to travel under the sea to help restore her mother to her rightful place.

At first Merliah think's she's losing her marbles, but Zuma convinces her that Oceana is real, and the adventure begins ...

Along the way there are plenty of grown-up jokes to amuse adults watching this with their daughters - for example, a lot of fishy parodies taking the mick out of the world of celebrity, fashion, the media, etc.

This DVD was given to my daughter as a ninth birthday present: I did wonder if she would be too old for it now, but she watched it several times and obviously enjoyed it.

Before we first rented any of the Barbie videos for my little girl, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, over-sugary and over here. In general, however, I have been pleasantly surprised.

Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccharine count, but the quality of that film and the other Barbie videos we have subsequently bought or rented, was significantly higher than I had originally expected before I saw the first one. They have kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - and introduced them to some beautiful stories. Several of them also introduced my children to great musical classics: others, of which this is one, had instead some enjoyable original or modern music. In all cases Mattel had hired first class international orchestras to provide the instrumental soundtrack.

On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony (Beethoven: Symphony No. 6), or ""The Queen of the Night's aria"" from Mozart's opera ""Mozart: The Magic Flute"", and my daughter, who was then five years old, recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-The-Magic-Of-Pegasus-DVD/dp/B000ANDB8U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie - The Magic Of Pegasus [DVD</a>]"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)

The music for ""Barbie in a Mermaid Tale"" is easy on the ear, though this is not one of those Barbie films - there are some - which you would buy for the music.

For reference, the Barbie films with beautiful musical scores taken largely from the classics include

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-of-Swan-Lake/dp/B0000A1HW7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie of Swan Lake</a>"" (with music from the ballet of that name)

The two best with music which is original rather than taken from the classics, are ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-The-Island-Princess-DVD-2007/dp/B000TP4FV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie - The Island Princess [DVD] [2007</a>]"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-As-The-Princess-And-The-Pauper-DVD/dp/B00061RZX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie As The Princess And The Pauper [DVD</a>]"" the music for which I can particularly recommend.

In terms of production values, the DVD runs very smoothly and is fairly easy to navigate around: it even more visually beautiful than the previous Barbie fantasy films, which is quite a high standard, and contains a few extras such as simple games.

Those people who enjoy criticising the way Mattel operate the Barbie franchise will not have much difficulty finding things in these films to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then these DVDs and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them.

Ditto if your children are sensitive about body image issues - the female characters in this story are all impossibly thin.

One charge which is sometimes made against the Barbie films but which does not hold water is the idea that they reinforce gender stereotypes. That criticism does not appear applicable to this particular film. There are few male characters: the heroine and central character is trying to rescue her mother, and willing to take great risks to do it, and does not appear particularly interested in boys, dates, or most of the other things teenage girls are stereotypically supposed to be obsessed with.

To summarise, these films are beautifully made, and will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. And there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch ""Barbie in a
Mermaid Tale"" with your offspring.",1285718400,,7026,5.9327398615232445

Granted, since it was a bday party, after about 50 mins they were ready to move on to cake, but it still held their attention longer than I'd expected. We've watched it a few times since, and both my 6yo daughter and 4yo son are mesmerized from start to finish. And I can actually say, I enjoy it too. There is more humor than I've seen in many younger kids' movies, and even though my kids didn't get some of it, I had a few good chuckles. I don't think I could watch it as many times as I've watched CARS, but it's alot easier on adults than any other Barbie movie and most of the other little girl movies we've seen.

As far as the ""occult"" stuff...give me a break. The destinies were funny little characters and the whole thing is completely harmless. Kids movies, especially girls' ones, are SUPPOSED to be magical. There's no need to take the *magic* and turn it into something treacherous, especially when the movie presents so many positive messages like this one does.",1271462400,6,1107,4.48019801980198

4050123,4,B0031REQJ0,"One of the things that I love about the Barbie movies is the music - there are a number of great Barbie movies with lots of amazing songs, like the songs in Barbie and the 3 Musketeers and Barbie as the Island Princess. And that's one thing that I've come to enjoy from Barbie movies. But unfortunately this movie doesn't have the same amount of new high quality songs that the previous ones have had. There is one main new song, and it's catchy, but that's about it. So I do miss the songs.

The story, however, is a good one. It's not a tale that hasn't been told - the Barbie writers tend to stick with classics - but it is a great story with great messages, about fitting in and figuring out what your heart truly desires. I think that the message in Thumbelina was a bit better, but this one wasn't bad!

I am a bit shocked, however, at the people here who have reviewed it and who are upset over the oracles in the movie. They're saying that the writers included the ""occult"" into the movie. Oracles are not the occult! It's not like the Barbie writers included demons or voodoo - oh wait, isn't there a Disney movie released lately that DID include voodoo? Why aren't the people on here complaining about the ""occult"" for that movie?

All in all it's a great Barbie movie, and while I wish there were more new songs, I loved the story and will definitely enjoy watching it again with my daughter.",1270339200,3,1403,4.326996197718631

The lead female character is strong but not full of herself. She's polite, and usually ends up saving everyone without a guy's help, and in a lot of the movies is actually saving the guy.
My daughter has been looking forward to this movie coming out since we saw the previews for it last year. We bought it the day it came out, as well as the Merliah doll and two others.  Up the the point of Merliah arriving at Oceanna, it was fun.  It was cheesy yes, but fun. The surfing scenes were great, and I could overlook the fact that Merliah has a waterproof video cell phone watch.  Arriving at Oceanna, all the mystique, all the grandeur that was in my children's imagination about Mermaids from the Fairytopia movies was instantly gone.  Merliah arrives to a place that is supposedly under the rule of the evil Eris. But we see Merliah arrive to a world that seems to be nothing but shopping, makeup and 'pufferazzi'.  The Destinies were the worst. Their voices were like nails on a chalkboard, and why on earth are these supposedly mystical psychic mermaids running a hair salon, worrying more about the evil Eris's split ends than the fact that they have an evil ruler who sends people to the dungeon for nothing.
Overall, the entire moving was lacking in the usual story quality you find with a Barbie movie.  Oceanna was a land of shallow materialistic mermaids who didn't really seem to mind being under Eris's rule as long as they got to go shopping.  Merliah was a good character, but there was a definite lack of the usual character development I've gotten used to with Barbie lead roles.
So far, my least favorite Barbie movie by far.  I am hoping they go back to the good music and stories they had with movies like  Princess and the Pauper, Island Princess and Diamond Castle.  Our girls are smarter than this, and they don't need to be pandered to with shallow materialistic story lines.",1269820800,3,2392,4.511574074074074
