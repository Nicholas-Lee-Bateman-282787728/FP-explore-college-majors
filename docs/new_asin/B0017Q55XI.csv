8326181,5,B0017Q55XI,"I bought this video because it is one of my favorite skate videos of all time. The Habitat videos, and the company itself, have a style that I have always enjoyed and I want them too keep pushing it. Kerry Getz part is great, Stefan Janowski kills it, and Danny Renauds part is so chill. The video also has a very good soundtrack to go with the skating.",1346716800,,353,4.205882352941177
