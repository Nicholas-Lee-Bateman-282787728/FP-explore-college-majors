7993134,3,B00009V7NX,dvd came in in time. no complaints here. dvd itself was just so-so and really not worth the money I spent.,1497830400,,106,4.095238095238095
7993135,5,B00009V7NX,"it is one of the best sexploitation movies I had ever seen, but it has only women nudity, and the lesbian content which was mostly real, beside the camera was right on the spot, close up with all the vagina details. The movie has nothing to do with Nazi Germans, or their system, it just a name on the curtain, but when you see what is behind the curtain WOW. lots of female nudity front, back, up, and down.",1398124800,,408,4.177215189873418

7993137,4,B00009V7NX,"I saw this DVD really cheap and decided to buy it on a whim. While totally not what I or anybody who tries to imagine the film based on the cover design would expect, I certainly was glad to have picked this title up. This is not a Nazi Exploitation flick like ""Ilsa"" or ""Love Camp"" and it's not really a S&M type film either despite having the word 'leather' in the title.
There is little plot to ""Fraulein Leather"", essentially a woman who is closeted lesbian gets a call from her boring husband who is away on a buisness trip and who she suspects uses these trips to cheat on her, before going to bed and having an erotic dream about a lesbian affair with the Fraulein and her friends. The first 5 minutes of the film are set the scene while the remaining running time is solely devoted to the lead characters explicitly filmed dream.
While I could see this type of movie would dissappoint most viewers, I really liked the over all style and the many surrealistic touches. The only sound in the movie is the surprisingly witty and well written narraction by the lead character and a very 60's score. I found the narration to be genuinely thoughtful and clearly evidence that there were more brains behind this film than most others of it's kind. I'm a huge fan 60's film scores so I liked the acid jazz music used, even if it sounded like it was secretly recorded one night at a swinger's lounge. Overall the little artistic touches give this film the feel of an amature shot short rather than a porno.
The picture quality is fairly good with quite vivd color for it's age, but the print however is fairly beat up showing a few scratches and the mono soundtrack is a little worn with hissing and popping.
Overall I found ""Fraulein Leather"" to be a charming piece of 60's porn chic, but once again if you're after for a Nazi exploitation or S&M look elsewhere.",1078531200,19,1862,4.431486880466473
7993138,1,B00009V7NX,"That means 'don't order!
I was very very disappointed in this seemingly American production, that could have been produced by a novice with a video cam corder.  There was nothing 'fraulein' to it, and not much leather.  However if you love simple lesbian interludes you may like it. It's pretty graphic, but sadly, NOT what some might think when seeing the title.  A terrible disappointment.
