5153241,3,B008DH9O86,"Cinderella is a classic movie - I have yet to watch the other two, but Being Disney animation, Im sure they're great... I bought this set for the 3 movies - 3 Disney movies in DVD and Bluray for $65 is a pretty good price, but I got my hopes up with the rest of the set... I was expecting a small story book, not a DVD case with 6 pictures. And for the Jewelry box, I was expecting a cheaply made wood/fiber board box, what I got was a paperboard bow with drawers - defiantly not something I would give a kid to play with. Overall I got what I wanted, but was very disappointed with the extra stuff

What really upset me was that this set was released on the 5 October... I preordered it in May, but it took over a week to even ship and then 5 days shipping when I pay for Amazon Prime... in the end, this was the first Amazon order that I was  really disappointed with",1350000000,27,869,3.9885057471264367

The movies are amazing I just watched the 1st and 2nd one and I loved them both! Cannot wait to watch the 3rd one!",1349913600,3,274,3.9107142857142856
5153243,1,B008DH9O86,"Let me just start off my review by saying this is not a review of the movie itself, but the awful box set that it is. I pre-ordered this package a while back and was excited to finally watch this classic Disney masterpiece. The thing is I couldn't!!

It turned out the box set is packaged like every other awful package that is left with bad reviews. The discs are in between cheap decorative cardboard. Not on the reg plastic holder kind that actually keep your discs in awsome condition. I don't understand why companies do this, especially Disney. I know why!!! They are only out for money not for our happiness. Two of the 6 discs in this set I recieved were severely damaged. They were unplayable.

This is very sad to see yet another set ruined by stupid marketing.

Now I have to waste my printer ink and time to send this item back to amazon and hope for my refund and no proplems.

DISNEY YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1349395200,15,923,4.443786982248521
5153244,4,B008DH9O86,I got this for my wife as an early birthday present. She liked it a lot. The digital copy will be nice on her iPod on vacation next month.,1349222400,,138,3.793103448275862
5153245,4,B008DH9O86,"This review is for the Trilogy packaging only- not a review of the movies themselves.

I'm a big Disney collectors, and typically pre-order every upcoming title. I was very excited to see the Cinderella Trilogy being release in a collectable box just as the Lion King was recently. For anyone who can remember, many years back Disney release Aladdin, Cinderella, and The Lion King (all linked below for reference) in collectable boxed platinum editions with a story book, lithographs, and nice keepsake package. I thought that these trilogies were going to be released again in a similar fashion, all the boxes would be similar, similar materials related to the films, etc. Instead, the Lion King set with a drum shaped box inner box which was essentially useless beyond a collectors point of view, but also included the 3D copy of the original feature, and lacked blu-ray copies of the sequels. For this Cinderella release, there is no 3D release, period, but the blu-ray copies of both sequels are included.

The jewelry box is very nicely constructed, heavy cardboard. It has a nice little functional mirror up top, not just a foil decoration (although, it does not feel like glass). The ""storybook"" is just a heavy cardboard book of sleeves for the DVDs with illustrations. I am not really a fan of this, especially since it's a poor way to store movies and will likely scratch the DVDs (the blu-rays will probably be fine.) At this time, it's the only way to purchase the trilogy on blu-ray. I imagine they did this intentionally to sell more of these, but that's just my speculation. November 20, Cinderella 2 & 3 will be released as a combo back.

One thing that really bothers me, is this set is only worth 300 Disney Movie Rewards points. I mean, 3 blu-ray movie gift set only worth 300? Since the Cinderella 2 & 3 movies will be released as a combo back instead of stand alone movies, you can get both for a lower price but miss out on additional points. With the Lion King 1.5 & 2 they were released separately, and each was 150 (for a total of 300). I wish this giftset would have been worth 450 points, just as the Lion King giftset was, the MSRP is only $10 difference. That, and the poor choice for storage of the DVDs takes away 1 star from my review.

In short-

If you're a collector or have a little girl who will appreciate the jewelry box, scoop this up. If you just want to have the movies, purchase the blu-ray Cinderella, and wait for November 20 when the Cinderella 2 & 3 are released (you'll save a few dollars doing this, and have standard blu-ray cases to store the movies)

5153249,4,B008DH9O86,"I have this pre-ordered from Disney Movie Club. Anyways, with all were getting I am very well satisfied.

The bracelet is from Disney Movie Rewards, which I was considering getting, but am very thankful that they included it in here. It is 2,500 points which means it is the cost of 34 dvds with the 75 point code or 10 blu-rays with the 250 point code... So just with the bracelet, we are getting more than what were paying for...

I hope that the jewelry box is made of wood... if it is cardboard, I will only be a tiny bit disappointed. Mainly because like I mentioned above we are already getting our money worth.

We get the story book, which I like because I have purchased the story book combo with many other dvd/blu-ray combos before... I can't remember all the names, but most have crafts or recipe's you can make in the back which are fun to do.

We also get

Blu-ray/dvd/digital copy ... the digital copy is redeemable through itunes.

The only thing I don't like is that only movies 2 and 3 are on blu-ray, usually all the movies are on blu-ray and the 3rd is on 3d blu-ray, but I guess they switched that around.

cinderella is the only one on digital copy

Then 2 dvds with special features and I'm guessing Cinderella is also on the dvd then instead of the blu-ray, but I don't see if it mentions that...

Anyways, it's a really good buy

Edited review:

I got mine a day early. I am disappointed, but not disappointed because it kind of is what I expected, but not what I expected. The jewelry box is a very sturdy plastic type material. It should last for many years.

We don't get everything were promised though. For the charm we have to go to DisneyMovieRewards.com/SparkleOffer  and enter our code. Once that is done, we can go through the steps. There is another charm on the offer if you want to pay $8.99

However, even if you just get the free slipper charm, you still have to pay $2.85 in shipping to get it to you... Very disappointed with this offer.",1336780800,5,1979,4.371584699453552

5153330,4,B008DH9O86,The Jewel Case while attractive is a little fragile. It's just cardboard. However my four year old daughter loves it and she's able to keep all of her charms from the disney rewards that she has earned from disney movie points in there. The movies are kept in a nice little box. I was disappointed that only the first Cinderella was available for digital download.,1362614400,,364,4.615384615384615
5153331,4,B008DH9O86,"This is a very nice collection. We have had it open for over a year. It is exactly as advertised. My daughters enjoy the box. Yes, it is made from paper, but what do you expect for the price when you consider all the versions of the different movies that you get. Disney decide that this was the price point it had to be at in order to sell.

The picture is a little confusing, b/c the closed book is the same book as that which is open. It is essentially your BlueRay/DVD box you'd keep by the tv, not really a book. The box is still intact and no where near falling apart more than a year later. Our three year old does play with it some, as it isn't quite as interesting as her music box with a ballerina, but it has it's own separate place in her imagination.

The reason I am giving this product four stars instead of 5 is that it would have been a better product if Disney had included digital copies of all three movies not just the original.",1360800000,,949,4.096774193548387

5153341,5,B008DH9O86,"The collection is excellent!  To purchase these as DVDs and Blu-Rays would cost a fortune and take up space on your book shelf.  The story booklet/dvd case is just the right size to keep on the shelf with the other movies while the kid plays with the box. The set also includes a digital copy of the original Cinderella *Not the sequels*!!!  I knew this when I purchased it because I READ THE ITEM DESCRIPTION BEFORE PLACING MY ORDER. To get the digital copy onto your device you need the password that comes in the box so don't throw away any of the inserts!  If you want digital copies of the other movies, I'm sure you can buy them from Disney's movie website.

(Sorry, I got tired of reading about how people felt cheated because they didn't read the part about the digital copy correctly.  I'm also tired of hearing about people's complaints that digital copies need a disc to download onto the device.  Seriously, spend $20 bucks and get a disc reader!  It's an invaluable tool incase your device ever needs an install. *stepping off the soap box*)

In conclusion.  The Presentation is great for a child. You really aren't paying more for the cardboard jewelry box compared to the prices of the videos individually. You can use the case to store your $20 external disc reader (Sorry, that's the last jab!).

Sorry if I came off harsh but really this is a great set for only $60. I really think it's worth the price.

1) Jewelry box is reinforced cardboard with paper hinges
2) Only the first movie has a digital format
3) All movies are in DVD and Blu-ray format
4) The story book is really a glorified DVD case, not a real book.
5) The booklet is sturdy and fits on the shelf in a space only a bit larger than a blu-ray case.

Hope this helps and wasn't too cynical.

Best of luck!",1357171200,27,1788,4.411585365853658

And you have to have a computer with a CD/DVD drive. I have a macbook air, so no disk drive. Disney's own FAQs say ""you can buy one"" [...] Well why would I buy one and get the digital copy? If I had a DVD drive, I'd just rip the DVD! This is why people pirate! And still out of touch studios do nothing to make it easier to purchase things legitimately.

The jewelry box is ok, but just reinforced cardboard, very cheap and drawers don't open and close easily. Was hoping for something a little more quality and substantial for my daughter",1356393600,,725,4.291970802919708

We play the digital versions on our Apple TV, but more importantly, we use them in the car on our IPOD connected to the car DVD player.
