3988002,4,B002U6CJCO,"Andre Arlovski should have played Michael Myers in the Halloween remake. Not only that but the director of Universal Soldier Regenerations, John Hyams, would have made a better director than Rob Zombie. He gets stalking and camera angles and kills in a Myers like way.

Just throwing that out there.

The movie itself is IMO the best of the series and it's the best by a lot not by a little. The action is great in this movie. It's brutal in the right amount and it's over the top just slightly so it never takes you out of the story it's set in. The origins (which go further back then we're shown in the first movie) of the Unisol's is told and it makes you wonder why they would even continue with these experiments (bad things happen). The thing about Van Damme's character is the idea of what does a Unisol do when it doesn't kill. Does it adjust to life? Does it have opinions or feelings. A somber brush stroke is painted over Van Damme's character and even on Dolph Lundgren as well and it's warranted.

A Unisol tries but for your own safety you don't want to be near one at any point. They're dangerous killing machines that shouldn't exist. That simple and when they don't kill well... it's just not who they are. It never hammers in their feelings but only brings them up at the right time as to make them compelling and not come off as an after thought.

Still the big thing here is the action and it's great. Overall as a film it's his most consistent as some of his flicks tend to waver a bit in terms of quality (in one aspect or another) I recommend.

This is probably Van Damme's best action movie.

With this ""UniSol"" Former UFC Heavyweight Champion Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski leading the way, they seize the crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor, threatening to unleash a lethal radioactive cloud. The only one who can stop them is Luc Deveraux, a UniSol who's been decommissioned for years. Reactivated and retrained, Deveraux must make a full-out assault on the heavily armed fortress. But inside, he'll discover not one but two of these virtually indestructible warriors. Andrew Scott, Deveraux's vicious UniSol enemy from the original Universal Soldier, has been secretly reanimated and upgraded. Now, these elite fighters are locked, loaded and programmed to kill; and the fate of millions hinges on this high-action showdown. In the third and by now the last Universal Soldier series, both Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are back for one last showdown together. Universal Soldier: Regeneration is an enjoyable movie, and leaves you with a sense that it's not over yet.",1265155200,5,1145,5.586206896551724
3988004,4,B002U6CJCO,"**SPOILERS**

Well, I went by Best Buy after work and they only had 2 Blu-ray copies and I didn't look to see how many DVD copies. (Hard to tell how many copies they really had sold or had available.) Anyways, they took my coupon after investigating it like it was fraudulent or something. Total came to $22 USD and change.

I opened it and didn't expect Blu-ray disc artwork, but it had some cool artwork of the ""coolers"" the Unisols are in in the movie. I popped it in the old PS3 and went to Blu-ray live to see what was available and it was just trailers, including the movie's trailer, which you could download in HD or stream in SD. I figured I'd download it later.

The movie came up with a trailer for ""Black Dynamite"" that was awesome. I skipped the next trailer. The menu screen came up and was nicely done with scenes from the movie. It gave the option to watch with MovieIQ or without and I chose to watch without this time.

The opening is perhaps one of the best parts of the movie and actually this part of it I don't care JC and DL are no where to be found. This is a great car chase and gun fight, expertly directed and filmed and does not look like DTV at all. It could have easily been a scene from a Bourne movie, just plucked out and put into this movie--that's how well done it was.

I like the subtle cues from Arlovski (NGU) (he looks down at his arm after being shot, but isn't bothered by it) that lead the viewer to see something isn't right about these kidnappers. They seem superhuman and they are. From the museum, to the car chase and ultimately the helicopter liftoff, you have a great dramatic action sequence of events that is spectacular.

The movie slows a bit to give everyone a breather, and to establish the overall plot of the movie. You have the main bad guy (Commander Topov) speaking in Russian (subtitles are fairly easy to read, but sometimes you have white on white and you miss something) and telling everyone what he wants and why he kidnapped the Russian premier's two children. During his ""voiceover"" Hyams plays out scenes of violence and takeover very well. Music is particularly effective in scenes like these to give you the mood of despair.

Dr. Colin is introduced as he barks orders at generic soldiers who are working for Topov. For me he was overacted and I was happy when he met his demise. He was a little over-the-top to me. Ironically, he had more personality and is more memorable than Topov. Kristopher Van Varenberg plays Dr. Colin's assistant in a few scenes and he is actually good for what the scenes were.

With all this mess going on, the US is working with the Russians to resolve this bomb and kidnapping threat. Many of the characters introduced have brief time and are throwaways--including the 4 original Unisols that are sent in and are killed rather easily by Arlvoski's NGU. I like the scene where Dr. Porter briefs the regular soldiers about the history of the Black Tower and White Tower Unisol programs. The clips are well set up and directed and give the series some depth and background, considering it loosely is related to US1and US2, as the time frames just don't match up. As a viewer you have to almost guess how this is related to the others. It could just as well be a standalone film. I think I may have thrown in one flashback scene from US1 just to give homage to it and remind people this is the same universe that the first one was in.

The scene with Luc and Dr. Flemming in a cabin is a rather poignant scene as it shows how vulnerable Luc has become and how he is trying rehabilitation to become completely human again. (Which brings to question, what happened to him after US2? This is where some time frames don't make sense. The doctor mentions Luc is making a lot of progress compared to 2 years earlier when they found him. Found him where? Found him when? 2 years after US1 or 2 years after US2?) The second scene with Dr. Flemming in the restaurant is a missed opportunity for homage to US1. Luc is sitting there listening to the Doc and sees a guy whom he thinks is approaching him. They could have had a flashback scene to the diner from US1 or they could have had him re-enact a similar ""diner scene"" here in this restaurant. Instead it is a brutal attack against an innocent patron and no real explanation as to why he snapped.

In the meantime, they establish more scenes of Arlovski's NGU stalking first generation Unisols and other soldiers almost like a Predator. His scenes are good, but he has no real presence other than the big brainwashed killing machine--which I guess he is supposed to be--but then again this does nothing for his future unless he is going to play a killing machine in every subsequent movie.

Mike Pyle is the real surprise and is far better than Arlovski in nearly all of his scenes. He isn't going to win any academy award be he gives a great performance as a regular United States soldier who, through skill, is almost a super soldier himself. He is believable in his scenes and he is able to keep the movie from slumping in the non-Arlovski, JC and DL scenes. (And with him being cloned at the end, it's clear that IF there is another US movie, he will be in it.)

When the terrorists demands are met and Topov plans to pack up things and leave, Dr. Colin brings in Andrew Scott, or a clone of him, and just like old times, Scott over-kills Topov and looks like he is enjoying it too much. Dolph shines so much in such a brief time. He gets up from killing Topov and confronts Dr. Colin by asking Colin the same questions that Colin was asking him as part of a reboot process, if you will. Dr. Colin, quirky as ever, tells Scott that Scott isn't the one to be asking questions and to obey him. Well, Scott takes him and gives him a free eye exam with no co-pay. Classic Dolph moment and a big welcome back to the infamous Sgt. Scott.

Meanwhile, the U.S. government has broken into Luc's cabin and kidnapped him and are getting ready to initiate him back into the Unisol program as it's clear that they have no other choice. (This is were belief has to be suspended, as why is one first generation Unisol going to have any better luck against the NGU than the other four that met their demise in about 10 minutes? Answer: Because this one is JCVD!)
There is a nice training sequence of Luc, where he trains with small firearms and close-quarters combat. I understand that some of this is not JC and I don't get that as this is easy stuff that an actor should be doing himself. I understand he had limited time, but come on.

The last scene with Dr. Fleming, you have a concerned Luc who knows he is about to lose whatever humanity he regained, but still cares about her safety. She refuses to leave him alone while he completes the transformation back to a Unisol. He grabs her like he is going to kill her but lets her go and he is a full-fledged zombie again, with a single goal, rescue the hostages. JC's acting is good for his limited screen time and his moments with the doctor are some of the best. This scene is especially good as he gets right back to how he was in the US1.

The long shot that everyone is talking about where the camera tracks Luc across the frozen landscape as he heads to the enemy HQ, killing everything in his way, is awesome. No other word. It is the beginning of ""JCVD"" replayed in this movie. It looks epic due to the way the Hyams captured it. JC looks formidable and he goes from an assault rifle to small arms to knife combat and you get some of the best action sequences in years. The choreography is outstanding and the blood is flowing all over as Luc kills one bad guy after another.

The eventual fight with JC and DL is somewhat of a letdown. Of course, it is cool to see the two fight again, but the fight itself, the length of the fight, and the context of the fight all bother me, the two times I've seen it. First of all, when Luc comes across Scott, Luc just stares--some recognition in his face--but nothing else. He says nothing. If he had said ""Sarge"" I would have fallen off the sofa. After all, Scott was experiencing old memories, why not Luc? Scott mutters stuff and Luc listens. The homage is clearly the two kidnapped children in the corner, like the two Vietnamese ones in US1. It was nice, but it could have been longer and more poignant. Luc attacks Scott in no time and they engage in a who can break down more walls in a row the fastest. There are some kicks and punches, but nothing like the ones in US1. This is more brutal, more close-combat. It's more grappling and wrestling than JC doing a jumping roundhouse to DL's head. The fight lasts 5 min. or so and Luc dispatches Scott with far more ease than in US1. It was way too quick and left me with a glass half empty feeling.

Luc manages to locate the kidnapped children and they follow him as he is attacked by Alovski's NGU. The fight between them in only marginally better than the fight between Luc and Scott. There are some good kicks by JC and the end fight is decent, but nothing as grand as in US1. I understand the location was limiting and there's only so many ways of making the same ""warehouse"" look exciting for fight setups, but by the last fight I was kind of glad. Don't get me wrong, the last 30 minutes are some of the best in a long time, but still I felt a bit letdown.

Overall, this is a solid movie. I liked it a lot, but throughout, something kept telling me that as much as I was liking it, it had the potential to be so much better had the emphasis not been on Arlovski and had JC and DL had more time. Hyams, Jr.'s direction is excellent. Hyams, Sr.'s cinematography was superb as it always is. The music was almost non-existent, but for the mood of this movie, it fit it. It accented what it was supposed to, but didn't drown out the creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere that was created. In the end it was bittersweet though, to see two iconic action heroes back on screen, but for such a small amount of time. But I'll take what I can get.

3988006,5,B002U6CJCO,"'Universal Soldier: Regeneration' finds an aging Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) struggling through behavioral therapy while a scientist sells the UNISOL technology to a terroist group. Helmed by first time director John Hyams, son of director Peter Hyams (timecop, Sudden Death). In this installment, you really get a sense the level of complication that would arise from the events of the first film, both emotionally and socially. ""Soldier gets killed in war, body frozen for twenty years only to be brought back to life as a weapon, etc etc."" Apparently because the second sequel was so bad and the direction the writer's took Luc Deveraux's character being ridiculous, this one pretty much ignores it. Which really, really works. Van Damme brought kickboxing to America, or at least to Hollywood and while he's always choreographed his own fight scenes; this one takes the cake(and at nearly 50!) The final battle between Lundgren and Jean-Claude here is one of the most brutal, raw, hands down best in years!

3988007,4,B002U6CJCO,"A fun action film with plenty of good stunts and the three main actors getting their varied screen time to satisfy their fans. I had more fun with the supplements but the film handles itself enough to where you get your money's worth on the BD.

The story takes place at a ransomed Chernobyl (Bulgaria subbed) by bad guys supported with a renegade scientist who happens to have his own Universal Soldier cache. They threaten to blow up one of the reactors unless some lame demands get met. Enter the American general played by Corey Johnson (worst performance I have seen for him) to facilitate using the cold storage Universal Soldiers. The story lumbers through the usual predictable fights and shootouts, but they got a UFC guy - Arlovski - to play the main bad soldier and he actually did a good job here. The writers found a way to get both Van Damme's and Lundgren's characters reused to meet again and the fun continues.

The Blu clarity was outstanding with only a few falters scattered throughout. The DTS was amped way up, but it gets used prolifically. The guns were given some serious volume, but the dialogue (the cheese was kept to a minimum) never gets drowned out. The supplements are fun and include:

* Behind the Lines, 20 minutes. A good documentary on the stunts and fights.
* Commentary with Lundgren and Hyams. I enjoyed listening to everything Dolph had to say about the project, working with Van Damme again, the hurdles of filming in Bulgaria, etc.
* MovieIQ. Turned this on while listening to the commentary so I am overloaded with trivia about these guys and the UniSol franchise right now - but it was worth the time.

3988008,4,B002U6CJCO,"15 minutes into this, I noticed something strange. I didn't want to turn it off which is pretty rare when talking about most of Van Damme's movies over the past decade. The thing that might kill this movie with some fans though, is that it is so different from the great original.  It is not a polished Terminator type action flick like the original was.  Director John Hyams' retelling is much grittier and with some of the locations and fights, it almost has more of a Bourne style feeling to it.  The action is furiously directed...very quick with no dopey slow motion.  The acting isn't great but it's decent and convincing enough...two qualities that have been lacking in recent Van Damme DTV casts.  It is true that Van Damme is only sprinkled throughout, but the film is so fast moving, before you know it, you are already at the final 40 minutes ...and he owns the *beep* out of it!!  There is a long tracking shot of him tearing up terrorist ass and it's probably the best action sequence he has ever been a part of.  It truly gets the heart pounding, and like me, you will probably re-watch it about 10 times.  It's also a refreshing blast to see Lundgren on screen even if it is pretty brief.  His and JC's fight is completely different from the one in the original.  There is no Hollywood gloss to it at all.  This is how the fight would be if these two met up and decided to scrap and it comes of very effective.  You can feel the anger and rage.  All in all, Unisol: Regeneration is  a solid little action flick.  Other than JCVD, it's easily his best movie since Sudden Death, which happened to be given to us by another Hyams...John's father, Peter.  It may not be a masterpiece and isn`t quite on par with the original but it`s still a lot of fun and it`s definitely a worthy addition to my bluray collection.  I'll definitely be keeping my eye on director John Hyams.  I'd like to see what he can do with a decent budget and some better filming locations. The subtle synth music score was well done too. Think along the lines of Vangelis, who created the Blade Runner soundtrack, or something John Carpenter might have composed back in the day.",1264636800,21,2162,4.444162436548224

Age takes away some of your endurance, but on the other hand, age also gives you wisdom...cool calculation, and experience. Young peeps have too many hormones going on; it scatters the brain. Lol. Anyway, have you seen Jean-Claude do the splits between two semis trucks driving tandem down an interstate? Google it. He really did that stunt. There were safety precautions taken during that stunt, but he DID DO it nonetheless. And Dolf Ludgren is no slouch either. Even without the steroids. And how about Andrei ""The Pit bull"" Arlovski as the Unisol? That guy is freaky big and bad. All of these guys are ""for real"" tough guys. You don't pull off moves like the ones in this vid without knowing some real MA.  I think this is the best Universal Soldier since the first one came out back in the eighties. You guys should watch this!! Okay,  here's a short SUMMARY of the plot: NO SPOILERS.

A group of terrorists descend upon, and take over the old Chernobyl Nuclear reactor; the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history.  Even though the levels of radiation has gone down around the surrounding lands and the abandoned ghost town that was once occupied by the workers that operated Chernobyl,  the sealed cooling tower still has aging depleted rods deep inside that could pollute half the world if it is...oh, let's say, BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS by a huge maniacally engineered explosion! And let's say that it's guarded by the biggest, meanest, Universal Soldier ever created? A Unisol...a Unisol has the technology that the original Universal Soldier's had, BUT, he's also a genetically engineered super man to start with. The Unisol is also mentally altered, there is no baggage to get in the way, HE's a one hundred percent loyal, incredibly obedient soldier. After all attempts to defuse the situation, there is no choice but to bring back Luc Deveraux back out of ""debriefing therapy"" and send him in. Luc is aging; his joints hurt but he has gained some mental ballance...But now he has to get fired back up and take care of Business...and guess who ALSO gets thawed out? That's right, Dolf is back. And he's more insane and dangerous than ever before. So, you have a Super Unisol, a seven foot insane, Mr. necklace-made-of-ears Dolf Ludgren! Oh, and a few dozen terrorists in possession of the detonator...How will Luc Deveraux overcome it all? Watch this vid and find out, you won't regret it. I think Universal Soldier: REGENERATION Is the best of the US series. Is it the greatest vid I've ever seen? No...Would I watch it again? Definitely! Would I recommend this to all my friends? I sure did!",1432857600,2,2793,4.703476482617587

3988154,5,B002U6CJCO,"I'm relavtively new to the Universal Soldier franchise. I was a young kid in the early 90's and in our house we liked Arnold, so only now as an adult am I going back and watching the Van Damme flicks. So having no prior background with these films, I went into 'Regeneration' pretty blind, and what a ride it was.

Within the first few minutes of the film machine guns are firing, tires are screeching, and blood is being shed. Director John Hyams is definitely making a statement here and telling the audience that these aren't the UniSol movies from the 90's, but a different beast altogether. We're getting a brutal, gritty, more serious take on the franchise, and I have to say: it's INCREDIBLE.

At a little over 90 minutes, the film moves quickly and the action is spaced out nicely. Never once was I bored and instead I was glued to the screen. This film is a total homage to the quick-paced, nasty action/sci-fi of the 80's. It knows what it wants to be and exactly what it doesn't want to be: an overlong, tongue in cheek, self-referencing, snoozefest. It takes it's characters seriously and gives the audience a tense and engrossing flick.

I guess it's pretty obvious that I loved this film. It was shot for around 10 million and I really think that needs to be taken into consideration when watching this. This film pulled off what modern, Hollywood action flicks haven't pulled off in quite some time; and that is: it was entertaining, serious, and tightly paced. This isn't the Expendables where everything is goofy and the actors are just playing characters of themselves and making endless in-jokes. Regeneration lets Van Damme and Lundgren be the characters they made famous over 20 years ago. Its incredibly refreshing.

I've rambled and gushed long enough. The point is, give this film a shot. If you've been craving the intense, brutal, bloody action of yesteryear with a cool plot and quick pace, then seek this out. As of this writing, the Blu Ray is around $8. Take a chance on it and don't let the ""Direct To Video"" thing dissuade you. This is high quality filmmaking worthy of your time.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1398988800,,2151,4.62041884816754

3988161,5,B002U6CJCO,"I wouldn't have thought that 1992's ""Universal Soldier"" needed another sequel.  1999's ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" and the two made-for-tv flicks that preceded it had done enough damage already.  Luckily, someone took one of the few intelligent aspects of ""Superman Returns"" (2006) and made another film in a series that ignores most of the other ones.  In this case, only the original film is taken into consideration and, even then, ushers in a welcome change of tone, theme, and an interesting handful of conflicting yet somewhat mutually sympathetic characters.

Jean Claude Van Damme returns to the role of Luc Deveraux, a U.S. Army sergeant originally killed in Vietnam before being reanimated by the government as a cyborg/soldier known as a UniSol.  As one of the very first members of that experiment, he is now part of a new one: to see if he can be returned to a normal life (if that includes reading People and watching American Idol, count me out). While he's busy playing progress/regress, a paramilitary group has seized the old Chernobyl nuclear plant and kidnapped the two children of the Ukrainian Prime Minister.  If their demands to release political prisoners are not met, they will detonate an explosive to release the remaining radiation at the plant, and probably off that one dude's kids.  As an additional security measure, the group has hired the mini-megalomaniacal American scientist, who developed the latest UniSol technology, and is supplying them with quite the new specimen (UFC fighter Andrei Arlovski).  If the U.S. military's deployment of 4 of their own UniSols fails to subdue the terrorist threat, they may just have to call Deveraux back from retirement.

As silly as this sounds it's given a serious treatment by a competent cast & crew, mostly via the watchful eye of director John Hyams (Dragon Eyes).  Not much of a budget either yet this is much more entertaining than so many theatrically released films of the past decade.  I liked this movie a lot.  I am not a huge fan of the original ""Universal Soldier"" or Van Damme (though they both have their moments) and I still totally dug this.  Some people feel that it's a rare feat for a sequel to best its predecessor but this does exactly that.  I'm saying that I loved a direct-to-video sequel to a theatrically-released original that I thought was just okay.

I knew this would not be a martial arts film but, like the 1st one, I was expecting there to be some martial arts in it. And while there is, it wasn't really what I was expecting or even what I'd normally prefer... but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  However, I can rarely get through a movie review without some obligatory gripes about the fight scenes (excepting maybe The Raid) and here it would be the all-too-obvious use of stunt doubles during a couple of the more ambitious brawls.  I can live with the fact that some of these cats are getting pretty old and can't physically do what they used to but it pulls the viewer out of the fantasy when the white guy from Antwerp is suddenly black from specific angles.

Other than that, most of the complaints I've heard about the film seem to be from people who had specific expectations that were not met.  Like the aforementioned change in tone or, perhaps, the limited presence of Dolph Lundgren (Red Scorpion).  While it is deceptive to have him all over the cover, rest assured, he makes the most of what little screen time he has.  I have also heard gripes about the use of locations like abandoned warehouses.  Part of overcoming a low budget is use of cheap location but Hyams doesn't take the easy way out there, either.  These places are dressed and filmed with sort of an open-yet-claustrophobic, hive-like feel, accentuated by the vaguely wintry season and the eerie retro-futuristic score.  This film heavily utilizes influences that the original did not, specifically Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" & ""Blade Runner"".

The DVD from Foresight Unlimited/Sony has a great 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen picture.  Language & subtitles only available in English (5.1 Dolby digital & SDH, respectively).  Special features include a ""making of"" featurette and commentary by the director and Dolph Lundgren.  To the open-minded action junkie who still counts patience as a virtue, this comes highly recommended.

3988185,4,B002U6CJCO,"This film was such a surprise. Van Damme is in top form, actually acts, an his fight scenes are incredible. John Hyams (son of director Peter Hyams) captures all of the action clearly while retaining a particularly brutal style. The opening car chase alone will get you into it.

It's not necessary to see the other Universal Soldier films, in fact this movie ignores all of them but the first. The only thing you'd miss out on is some subtleties in Dolph Lundgrens performance (yes, Lundgren's performance has subtleties!). However if you are a fan of the original film, this is a great sequel. Side stepping the second film entirely, this one finds Van Damme's Luc Devereaux in a rehabilitation program to bring him back into society. When the son of a murdered general uses an improved version of the original UniSol's to occupy the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, Van Damme is forced back into action.

Of course there's a lot more to it than that, more than you'd expect. Van Damme puts in some great work here, some of the best of his career. The movie doesn't feel the need to shoe horn in a love story or unnecessary plotlines, focusing on character and brutal fight scenes. Van Damme stays out of most of the first half of the movie, at least as far as the action is concerned, letting some truly fantastic martial artists steal the show until he arrives. When he does, he kicks some serious ass. Some stand out scenes include Van Damme clearing an entire building in one continuous shot. There's also some very poignant moments between him and Dolph Lundgren, who is brought back and handled in a very intelligent way. Their fight scene is also exceptional.

Basically if you're an action fan, a martial arts fan, a Van Damme fan, or a fan of this series you should definitely check this out. It's a big part of a growing trend of DTV action movies that are of a very high quality, sometimes much better than the more expensive films that arrive in theaters.

3988188,5,B002U6CJCO,"I thoroughly enjoy Jean-Claude Van Damme movies. As of this moment I am the owner of about 6 Van Damme movies on blu-ray. I realize that most of his movies are a little lacking and are far from being oscar-worthy material, but there's something about the awkwardness of the Muscles from Brussels that makes him very compelling. He is not the greatest actor ever, but you can't help but root for him. It's like he's the ultimate under-dog. The guy who can't catch a break, but always beats the odds anyways. I love the original Universal Soldier, and I have never seen the oft-maligned sequel. I purchased the original Universal Soldier a few years ago on a whim, when I first discovered Van Damme and his peculiar way of emoting. I was smitten. I love action movies. Particularly ones that are bombastic and entertaining. I had heard that US: The Return was a major failure, so I decided to be content with the first movie. Flash forward a few months, and I stumbled upon the trailer for this movie. At first I was very wary. I mean, let's face it, Van Damme is not a major name anymore and most direct-to-home video releases are horrible. I read a few reviews, and I saw a few clips, and I decided to take a chance.
It was the best decision I've made in a while. This movie is spectacular. The script is good, the acting is excellent, and the fight scenes are something to behold. I like to consider myself a sort of action movie connoisseur, and I like to consider this movie as a type of hidden gem. One of those movies that kind of slipped through the cracks because some studio big shot didn't think it was good enough for a theatrical release. In my opinion, Van Damme's acting abilities have improved exponentially in his old age. He has somehow managed to make his wooden and awkward way of acting into something resembling the persona of a troubled and afflicted warrior. The way he talks and the way his eyes look empty are very fitting to his character.
The movie clips along at a good pace, and there is hardly any filler. From beginning to end we are treated with a competent (if a bit fantastical) and well-handled plot. The high point of the movie is definitely the Van Damme vs Lundgren face off. That fight scene is particularly brutal. It's also a nice tip-of-the-hat for fans of the first film. Lundgren, by the way, is extra creepy in this movie. His portrayal of Andrew is damn good. It's actually a little unnerving.
Something that is worth mentioning is the soundtrack for this movie. It's synthesized, and it's phenomenal. It's really reminiscent of classic 80's action movies. This movie has actually given me hope in Van Damme. I sincerely hope that he can get back to being a big name action star. He may not be the best action hero, but in my opinion, he has the potential to be more entertaining than Stallone or Schwarzenegger.
Obviously, I cannot recommend this movie enough.",1335744000,,2906,4.558317399617591

3988214,4,B002U6CJCO,"Universal Soldier Regeneration (2009) is a hard edged continuation of the universal soldier saga that forcefully demonstrates how violent and brutal the original concept could have been.  The film reunites the stars of the original 1992 film, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, and features ex-UFC champion fighter Andrei `the Pit Bull' Arlovski.

The original Universal Soldier (1992) was released when Van Damme was near the height of his popularity.  Based on the intriging concept of reanimating soldiers and turning them into hybrid fighting machines, the film featured some action and violence, but had a comedic comic book undertone, that was fairly typical for Van Damme's films in that era.  The lightweight goofiness was cranked up, in the poorly conceived sequel Universal Soldier: The Return (1999), which could easily have brought the saga to a sad close.

Directed by Peter Hyams, Universal Soldier: Rengeration (2009) is a gritty and meaner reboot.  With Van Damme and Lundgren past their physical prime, Andrei Arlovski assumes the most physically challenging role of the NGU (Next Generation UniSol), a genetically modified fighting machine.  Unlike previous versions of Universal Soldier, NGU is a truly ruthless and efficient killer, deadly with weapons, or in hand to hand combat.

Dr Colin (Kerry Shale), a renegade scientist has made NGU's services available to General Boris (Aki Avni), the leader of a band of terrorists who kidnap the children of Russia's prime minister.  The group occupies the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, threatening to blow it up unless their demands are met.  The opening sequence where the abduction takes place, gets things off to a flying start, and establishes the brutal character of the film, as NGU operates with deadly precision.  The Joint Forces Command send a strike team to Chernobyl, that includes four older model UniSol's, but up against NGU, they are decisively crushed.

Dissatisfied with the situation, Dr. Colin releases a revamped version of UniSol Andrew Scott (Lundgren) to eliminate General Boris and his men.  Scott accomplishes this task, but proves to be mentally unstable.  Captain Burke (Mike Pyle) is sent in to try and recover the hostages.  Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) has been in a rehabilitation program, but soon returns to his violent ways, and with time running out, is dispatched to stop the destruction of Chernobyl.

There is a jumble of activity inside the plant, as hostages Dimitri (Yonko Dimitriov) and Ivana (Violeta Markovska), led by Burke, try to escape.  Van Damme has one major action sequence, but it's a damn intense.  Operating like a character in a video game, he racks up kill after kill.  Lundgren's availability was limited, so his part is rather small, but the film has a fantastic tightly executed fight sequence between Scott and Deveraux, with a mind blowing finish.  Lundgren and Van Damme do show signs of age, and although in reduced roles, they battle like true gladiators.  There is no shortage of high intensity combat, as Arlovski, MMA fighter Pyle, and others handle the remaining action scenes.

Regeneration establishes the NGU as a cold-blooded and ruthless fighting unit.  The once affable Deveraux is all business, and Andrew Scott is just raving mad killer.  They don't have many lines, but the performances by Van Damme, Lundgren, and especially Andrei Arlovski are all very solid.  And Mike Pyle is quite impressive in his film debut.  Wherever these guys are, becomes a killzone.  The plot of Regeneration doesn't make a lot of sense, and the ending is a bit clichd, but the film delivers an abundance of solid bone-crunching action.  Kudos to Peter Hyams and those responsible, for resurrecting Universal Soldier, and restoring much of its lost luster.  The writers made provisions for continuing the story, so perhaps there will be another sequel.",1303430400,,3888,5.195826645264847
3988215,2,B002U6CJCO,"I have followed Jean Claude Van Damme in a lot of his films. I was a big fan from the era of ""No Retreat, No Surrender"", ""Lionheart"", ""Double Impact"" and also ""Hard Target"". He was the best during the era of the 90's for split kicks and the most perfect roundhouses you could see. The Universal Soldier franchise wasn't that bad. But, the character has not only aged, but he's forgotten that he had a 13 year old daughter in Universal Soldier: The Return! He was aging properly in this installment and wanted to live the rest of his days as a father, but now the story has completely changed and he's been living in a institute where the good doctor is trying to help him cope with his issues of not being a UNISOL. Then we bring back another original; Dolph Lungren, and his character is the only one that is exactly as the orignal story placed him - he just wasn't cutting off ears and wanting to keep them as personal gifts. But, his mental issues were still there.

So, I have to sum it up by saying that I wasn't surprised at all. A trilogy works on great titles [Mission Impossible, Terminator, etc] . Even a film that goes on to make four movies (with all the same actors) can do well [Lethal Weapon, Die Hard]. But, this one should have stopped at The Return! They don't even like to talk about the Universal Soldier 2 Brothers In Arms, and they are also in post production of a Universal Soldier: A New Dimension!

There's no doubt the second Universal Soldier movie with Bill Goldberg was just a joke and doesn't fit in with the amazing original and this latest intallment, which would be just as good as part 1 if Dolph Lungren were in it for more than a total of about 5 or 10 minutes.  If you liked the character and feel of part 1, then do yourself a favor and pick this up because it feels like it picks up after a LONG pause since the first one - as if the joke of part 2 never happened.  Yes, Van Damme is getting old but he still looks fierce in this; acts and appears just like a 50 year old zombie on steroids would.  I was very skeptical about this one but after watching my friends copy and having the price drop down to a reasonable $9, I just bought it.

(1.) Jean-Claude is looking healthier which is good to see.
Negatives:
(1.) I knew the movie was in trouble the second I saw the ""indestructible"" fighters putting on soccer shin guards -  OK?

Or, being annihilated by rapid fire firearms with unlimited ammo - please, that is so old special effects.
(3.) The combat consultant had the soldiers going around corners with weapons drawn and turning like they were in slow motion molasses - very lame. In fact the way they moved I thought they were 80 year old actors with CGI to make them look younger.

3988234,3,B002U6CJCO,"Universal Soldier-Regeneration(released Jan/10) is the newest incarnation of the long running franchise which started way back in 1992. It's hard to believe it's been that long and harder still to believe Van Damme,Lundgren et al can still make with the action sequences as good as they do here 18 years later. Van Damme seems to look the older of the two but both are still in great physical shape. Screenwriter,director,cinematographer Peter Hyams comes on board as camera head while his son John directs. Peter of course has worked with Van Damme in Timecop and Sudden Death, so along with Lundgren it was old home week on the set in Bulgaria.
The story involves a group of rogue terrorists looking to free some political prisoners in the Soviet Union. To facilitate this the terrorists seize control of the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant and threaten to blow one of the reactors within 72 hours while also kidnapping the Russian Presidents teenage children for good measure. In order to accomplish his agenda the head of the terrorists General Boris(Akni Avni)has hired a now rogue scientist from the States who worked on the original Uni-Sol project to provide an NGU(new generation Uni-Sol).The NGU has been improved on a genetic level and is faster and stronger than the original Uni-Sols. And this has proven quite effective as he single handedly repels attack after attack of the joint US/Russian force assigned the job of retaking the plant and rescuing the children.
In the meantime ex-Uni-Sol Luc Devreaux(Van Damme),who has been in rehabilitation to get him off the project drugs in order to reintegrate him back into society,has again been recruited to rescue the children. As the clock ticks down the Russian president finally capitulates to the terrorists demands ending the tense stand off. However the rogue scientist with an agenda of his own and tired of being pushed around and used by the terrorists,finally unleashes his ace in the hole. All along he has kept hidden a Uni-Sol from the original project,Sgt Scott(Lundgren),who he re-animates in an effort to start a new Uni-Sol/NGU army. But Sgt Scott does not respond well to his reawakening and is even more psychotic than before. He kills the scientist and is just about to kill the children when Luc arrives on the scene. A brutal battle ensues between them with Luc barely managing to come through with a victory. Next Luc has to not only safeguard and remove the children from danger he has to confront and stop the terrorists' NGU.Through a series of pitched battles Luc finally manages to take down the NGU with the bomb originally destined to blow the reactor up with.
An explosion occurs and we see the aftermath with haz-mat suited personnel picking up the pieces and brandishing Geiger counters. The film ends with a scientist who helped the government side during the mission looking over newly cloned super soldiers.
When the movie starts one expects to see Van Damme momentarily but one has to wait about 17 minutes before this happens as the film makers get their narrative going. It is almost 50 minutes into the film before we see Lundgren/Scott and unfortunately Lundgren is all too soon dispatched by Van Damme/Devreaux. However during that brief encounter Lundgren(to his credit)manages to project that deadly menace we remember oh so well from the first one. The sole NGU played by Andrei Arlovski(ex MMA fighter and UFC champion)also does a surprisingly well turn as the single-minded and deadly killing machine he is. Director of photography Peter Hyams does a great piece of work on his instrument of choice. The camera motion is fluid throughout and he gives us many close angles of the on screen action,even to the extent of blood splattering on the lens,that gives an immediacy to the proceedings that otherwise would not have been there otherwise.
The film was shot in Bulgaria at a location that looks like some abandoned factory that subbed for Chernobyl. There are a couple of stumbling points in the script if one wants to get picky. One is Devreaux's re-integration into society. One almost has to overlook the second Van Damme installment Universal Soldier-The Return,because in that film Devreaux seemed to be a fairly well adjusted consultant/individual to the entire project,even having a brief romantic involvement with a reporter. Here a scientist has been working with him to take him off the Uni-Sol drugs and he acts more like a zombie than the more normal character he portrayed in The Return. Secondly is the whole Chernobyl area idea. The entire area around the reactor in reality is a dead zone and highly radioactive. Anyone going as close to the grounds as the terrorists and the rescuing joint US/Soviet forces did would die a terrible radioactive induced death in short order. The Uni-Sols and NGU are another matter that could be over looked due to their enhancements but not the others.
The stories' plot is a usual good guys versus bad one with alot of been there-done that scenarios but it does include more suspense than the usual shoot em' up action flicks,which elevates it slightly above the average flicks of the genre.
Technically the film is a direct to video transfer and has been done very well. The sound is top form and it is presented in a nice 2:35:1 widescreen ratio. The extras are a little thin as there is just a commentary by the director and Lundgren and a behind the scenes 20m featurette. The DVD comes in a regular size keep case and is itself enclosed in a cardboard case which mimics the DVD cases'cover;which has a nice embossed feel to it.
All in all I give the film 3 1/2 stars. Although nothing too special it is a better than average action flick and is an attempt at restarting the franchise. Van Damme and Lundgren are both looking their ages(especially JC) but both can still kick on screen cinematic butt quite well. Lundgren's late and relatively brief on screen appearance is a disappointment but we hope to see more of this pair in the NEXT installment in Universal Soldier#4. Oops,did I say that? You didn't hear it from me.",1276387200,2,6082,4.882978723404255

REGENERATION

The 5th film in the series and yes that is correct it is the 5th film thus far about every one's favorite non human fighter. And with it being the 5th it is also the 5th film with lead character Luc Deveraux but only the third with Van Damme in the role. Now there has been plenty of mix up since the first film. Parts 2 and 3 were direct to video sequals that followed what happened in the first film. Then came 4 which brought back Van Damme so it ignored the previous two and followed off after the first film. Then comes this one here which I believe ignores the previous 3 and follows on after the first. It would be confusing but I consider all of them apart of the series so what ever, this is the 5th.

Now the big deal with this one was that not only was Van Damme returning but so was Dolph Lundgren, so we can see these two go at it once again. But on top of that MMA stars Mike Pyle and former UFC Heavyweight Champ Andrei Arlovski were set to star as well. So naturally with all of that tapped to be in the film you know I was excited to see this. In fact right here in Austin TX before the film was released on DVD there was a special screening of the film in October of last year.

This film is about a group of terrorists who kidnap a Prime Minister's kids and then demand that their fellow terrorists are released from jail. A time limit is set and they will kill the kids and blow up a Nuclear Power Plant, of course you know what that can do. Add in that they have the next level of Universal Soldier at their disposal since trader scientist Dr. Colin has created the NGU. The NGU stands for Next-Generation UniSol and he is one bad dude. So naturally all plans are set into motion and they even bring back the original UniSol Luc Deveraux who is trying to work his way into normal society.

Now of course some where in there Andrew Scott is brought back via a clone and is upgraded of course. So the big show does are expected and of course you will eventually get them. I must say that the best thing about this film is just that, the action and the fights. Naturally with Van Damme and Dolph back and Mixed Martial Artists Arlovski and Pyle you know this one is good. There is plenty of gun fire in this film but it is the hand to hand that I really enjoy, especially between Van Damme and Dolph. They all do a great job when they lock horns in this one. But the story between Luc and Scott is just to good and adds to the emotion. Also I must say that the two do a good job in this one as far as acting, Van Damme seems to be channeling his performance from ""JCVD"" while Dolph just seems cold and emotionless just like the character calls for. The scene were he is going to kill the kids is great, his emotionless confused face is great.

Now with that said I must say that Andrei Arlovski really has another career he could go into because he did an excellent job in this film. Seriously he may be the best MMA turned actor I have seen, he actually is the star of the film and does a wonderful job. Same can be said for Mike Pyle who surprised me and it seems he may be back for the next film. Kerry Shale is great as the mad scientist that creates the NGU and gives maybe the best performance of the film. To be honest even with this being a B action film it really may be the best of all the sequals. It may also be considered a really good film, I think so.

Written by Victor Ostrovsky and directed by John Hyams it was obvious that they went into this wanting to make a really good movie.  John of course is the wonderful filmmaker behind the excellent documentaries on Mixed Martial Artists Renzo Gracie [Fight Day] and Mark Kerr [The Smashing Machine], I recommend both highly. I believe it was those documentaries that not only lead to the casting of Arlovski and Pyle but the understanding of how to make the fights look real. Along with his father Peter who shot this film [and was also the director on Van Damme's ""Time Cop"" and ""Sudden Death"" films] they made the film feel real and gritty. In fact in some ways this may be better than the first film. To be honest the writing on this film was great and went beyond the standard b action sub par script, real dialogue.

Honestly I do recommend this film and not only for a rental I am a proud owner of this film. Of course I am a huge MMA fan and that has a lot to do with it and am also a fan of Van Damme but it is still a really good movie. If you do get the chance to see this film I a sure you will enjoy it. This film as a very good script, good cinematography, good direction, and some good performances, I was surprised by how good it was. Maybe going in with low expectations helped but it really is a good film. I say give it a try.

There are some great special features like behind the scenes and a great commentary.",1273795200,,4846,4.114164904862579

1. Who is he? Luc Devereaux, the only remaining Universal Soldier (UNISOL) from the first experiment, who has now defected from his original assignment and destroyed the second generation (i.e. Bill Goldberg)
2. Which family member/friend must be avenged? For the first time ever, this is not a subplot.  This is much more serious than a personal vendetta.
3. Does he take his shirt off? A soldier doesn't take off his uniform, body armor, or camouflage.
4. Does he have sex with a C-List actress? No. :(
5. Is there a tournament? No.  :(
6. Is training needed for this tournament? Absolutely!  He has to shake off the rust since the last UNISOL fight.
7. Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament? The splits come, but they're more of the split kick variety.
8. Does he punch someone in the balls?  For the purposes of this film, and this film only, the ball shot has been replaced with the throat slash...and it's outstanding.
9. Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? There are multiple patented kicks AND he beats the crap out of a morbidly obese guy in a Waffle House.
10. Is his enemy unbeatable? An upstart former Soviet Union country less significant than the others you've never heard of is hardly unbeatable, much less worrisome, especially for JCVD.
11. Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance? He's given a nearly lethal dosage of psychotropic drugs, so that probably makes it more difficult.
12. Does he win? Cold War II averted

After an armored vehicle abruptly abducts an anonymous teen pair at a museum, most of the plot is set.  When the same villains turn out to be disillusioned former Soviet soldiers intent on hijacking the left over nuclear capabilities of Chernobyl and unleashing some sort of third generation UNISOL (Andre Arlovski), the situation gets serious.  Consequently, some fictitious multinational faction - as if the UN had a military force - sends in sheep to the wolf (complete with four first generation UNISOL sacrificial lambs).

Meanwhile, first generation UNISOL Luc Devereaux is undergoing therapy, has aged quite a bit, and has a nasty bump on his forehead.  We all know he's coming in to save the day, stop the Third Gen. UNISOL, and stop nuclear winter from creating a sub-species of Russians with pasty skin and three ears.  Will he succeed when the enemies have all the chips, and some secrets, on their side?

Aside from the normal awesomeness of JCVD, this one is well worth the viewing for the action.  An extended fight scene between JCVD and Arlovski - who loses via TKO - is just ridiculously cool.  TONS of gun play, a close up shotgun blast through the head, and enough blood splatter from bullets and knives aplenty (JCVD is obviously a knife-fighting expert now) makes this one of the more exciting Van Damme flicks yet.",1271289600,,2854,4.739393939393939

What was disappointing was that there were barely any speaking parts for the main stars, just monosyllabic responses to questions asked by the supporting cast.

3988250,4,B002U6CJCO,"Ten years after ""Universal Soldier: The Return"" flopped at the box office, and some say killed the franchise, the series returns with ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"". Featuring a better story, even harder hitting action sequences, and both Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren reprising their roles from the original, will this newest installment wash away the bad memories left behind by its predecessor?

""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" begins when terrorists take control of one of Chernobyl's leftover nuclear reactors, threatening to unleash massive devastation unless their demands are met. Not wishing to negotiate with terrorists, the government sends in a military strike force; however, the terrorists have a nasty surprise up their sleeve... the next generation of UniSol (UFC Fighter Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski). As their strike force is torn apart, the only alternative the government has left is to reactivate one of the original UniSol's, Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme).

If you're like me, when you saw that another entry into this franchise was being released you probably had these thoughts or something similar, ""What? Someone's made another Universal Soldier movie? The last one was horrible. Why would someone go back for more?"" Well, that someone happens to be up-and-coming director John Hyams (son of famed director Peter Hyams), and the end result is actually much better than expected.

Written by first-time screenwriter Victor Ostrovsky, this newest installment opts to completely ignore the events of ""Universal Soldier: The Return"", along with the two Made-for-TV movies, and serve as a direct sequel to the original film. The story is very tight, fast-paced, and filled with high-energy action sequences to thrill fans of the original. The previous film made the unwise decision to squeeze in as many comedic moments and cheesy one-liners (none of which were humorous) to break up the non-stop violence, while inadvertently causing the audience to wince in pain at the cinematic abomination on display. In contrast, this film chooses to inject a simple, yet decently crafted dramatic story; which works very well for this type of film, I might add.

One part of the story is focused on the terrorists (although this portion is generic and by-the-book), while the second part centers on Luc Deveraux's attempt at returning to a normal life, despite his still prevalent killer instinct. It is in these moments regarding Luc's ""de-programming"" that the movie really begins to rise above being just another stock action title. Of course these quieter, more dramatic scenes within the movie were only made possible by the surprising performance delivered by fading action star Jean-Claude Van Damme.

In the original film, Van Damme showed some slight emotional range; however, all of his acting range was all but omitted from the sequel and most of his other action movies as well. For this film, Jean-Claude once again finds the emotional core of the character, offering a more contemplative hero who desperately wants to take control of what's left of his life. His performance here is proof that with the proper material and direction, Van Damme could still be an effective action star despite his age. For those of you that may scoff at this observation, I give you Sylvester Stallone (""Rambo"") or Bruce Willis (""Live Free or Die Hard"") as examples of how aging action stars can still make their most recognizable characters relevant in the modern day.

Alongside Jean-Claude is former UFC Heavyweight Champion Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski as the next generation of UniSol or NGU as he is referred to in the movie. Andrei isn't the most eloquent of speakers with the English language, but thankfully, the script doesn't call on him to give much more than one or two word statements. Of course, his acting chops (what little he may possess) weren't the reason for his casting in the role. Obviously, with his background in the UFC, it's not difficult to determine why Andrei got the role of the primary villain in the film. His fighting prowess, not to mention the director has done a couple of documentaries surrounding the world of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) fighting, made him an ideal candidate to inject new blood into the dying franchise.

On a related note, the fight scenes are extremely hard-hitting and brutal, thanks in no small part to Andrei Arlovski's UFC roots. The more up close and personal style of fighting is a departure from the flashier style with lots of cool moves, kicks and flips that most of Van Damme's movies typically employ. The downside is that initially the fights appear to run together because Arlovski's character of NGU seemed to dispatch his opponents the exact same way. Luckily, after the opening fight sequences the remainder became much more varied and exciting; otherwise, boredom would have set in as quickly as it had done for its predecessor.

Rounding out the headliners for the movie is actor Dolph Lundgren, who reprises his role as Andrew Scott from the original film. Sadly, Dolph's appearance in this movie is all too brief, and occurs very late in the story. I presumed with his character being shown on the cover that Dolph would play a major part in the film. In truth, his role is nothing more than an overly long cameo appearance to assist in tying this film directly to the first one. While his character of Andrew Scott was more unhinged and homicidal in the original film, this iteration is a much more subdued individual. Although, there is a hint that the maniac still lurks beneath the surface, just waiting for a chance to be unleashed. Thus, providing some added tension to his time onscreen opposite Jean-Claude, making those scenes even more entertaining.

The rest of the cast of characters are fairly forgettable, and amount to nothing more than typical action movie fare. The terrorists for the most part are bland and generic, as is the military forces brought in to stop them. Of course, even if this weren't a Direct-to-DVD sequel, one wouldn't expect much more from a theatrically released action film either. After all, the main reason you watch these movies is to see the UniSol's in action, typically fighting each other, and anything else is irrelevant.

Overall, ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" is a satisfying sequel that blows its theatrical predecessor out of the water (a rare feat for a Direct-to-DVD follow-up). While not quite as good as the original film, the movie does stand up well on its own though. The story moves along at a brisk pace, without getting tangled up in plot holes or inconsistencies. The action is much more visceral than any of the previous entries, and of course, it's fun to have the two stars of the original film back to reprise their roles at least one more time.

How can I accurately express that after eighteen years of struggling through unworthy sequels, one of the coolest action premises of the early-90s is back on track? Well, for now, take my word on it: ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" is good. Damn good, even, considering the apprehension I endured while the film was being made, knowing that it was shot in Bulgaria (favored locale of all cheap direct-to-video fare) by a director with limited accolades to his name (John Hyams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Smashing-Machine-The-Life-and-Times-of-Extreme-Fighter-Mark-Kerr/dp/B0000C52JT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Smashing Machine - The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr</a>) and wouldn't see a theatrical release in the western world. Well, none of that's changed, but guess what? - sequel number four is officially on top of the heap, from its solid dramatic performances to its no-nonsense action content, therein giving the series a complete, welcome genetic makeover.

The story: when a Russian terrorist faction led by a vengeful commander (Zahary Baharov,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Command-Performance/dp/B002IRYYPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Command Performance</a>) take the prime minister's children hostage in a crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor fortified by the next model of deadly UniSol (UFC star Andrei Arlovski), the only force capable of breaking through their defenses when all else have failed is the recommissioned, reprogrammed Luc Devereaux (Van Damme)...but unbeknownst to him, he'll be meeting more than one killing machine, for his old enemy Andrew Scott (Lundgren) has been genetically recreated and is as unstable and hell-bent on destruction as he ever was.

Right from the start, it's clear that this isn't your regular, overblown DTV movie: the film starts silently with minimalistic titles that take up no extra amount of time or space, but within the few minutes that follow, the new UniSol has established himself by kidnapping the children and plowing through waves of police defense with an armored truck and a powerful machinegun. By now, you're only five minutes into the movie, you haven't heard a beat of music and you don't even know who the inhuman kidnapper is yet, but already you've witnessed an action scene more intense than most else on the DTV market. The remaining action content is sparser than anything I'm used to, but is so very good, timed so intricately, and so handily placed that it's hard to complain. In all, there are about five hand-to-hand fights, a couple shootouts, and a combination of both featuring Van Damme blasting through enemy lines before taking on a houseful of terrorists by knife. The hand-to-hand fights in particular are extremely satisfying:  featuring UFC alumnus Mike Pyle and stuntman Dian Hristov (primary double for Dolph Lundgren and Steven Seagal) and choreographed as a blend of mixed martial arts, karate, and pro wrestling moves, they are extremely well-shot, of a good lengths, and remain exciting despite their insistence on relative realism.

""Regeneration"" makes no pretense about being a DTV feature: the film quality doesn't feel mainstream at all and there are a couple storyline twists that would have never been cleared in a Hollywood production (for good reason), but nevertheless, the movie mounts critics and beats them about the head with how competent it is despite its flaws and limitations. Take the shooting location, for example: in any other film, the bleakness of the abandoned industrial complex would've looked boring as hell, but through the masterful cinematography of Peter Hyams, the reactor building becomes a myriad of imposing, colossal architectures like something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B000G6BM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>. With the occasional exception (e.g. Kerry Shale as the scheming UniSol engineer), acting performances are strong among the supporting cast. Authentic Russian is spoken throughout the film, which is always nice. Van Damme channels some of the dark energy he expressed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JCVD/dp/B001PWY4NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JCVD</a>&nbsp;to show a new, broken side of Luc, and Dolph deserves definite credit for his own ""JCVD""-esque existentialist monologue.

The DVD cover bills Andrei Arlovski over both Lundgren and Van Damme, and while this is an accurate accreditation in terms of screentime, it does not diminish the importance of the other two stars. On the other end of the spectrum, Lundgren is seen the least of the three and plays more of a supporting role, but his presence is acknowledged throughout the movie without feeling insufficient. Both he and Van Damme only go into real action mode an hour into the film, but the buildup to the last 25 minutes has been so expertly handled and the payoff so grandiose that you don't feel cheated. Though Luc and Andrew do ultimately engage in the promised rematch, their reunion prior to this unfolds in an unexpected way. Without spoiling anything, a role reversal has taken place: feeling his age and coming off years of anesthetizing therapy, Luc is remade into a soldier at the cost of his barely-regained humanity, whereas Andrew switches between violent confusion and dreamlike contemplation of his existence in a manner not unlike that of Frankenstein's monster, making him slightly sympathetic. Nevertheless, it's unclear whether the events of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-The-Return/dp/B000022TSJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier - The Return</a>&nbsp;are acknowledged in Luc's condition and it's never laid out why Andrew can override his programming like he does, and this could potentially hurt a few peoples' opinion of the movie. It doesn't help that the Luc vs. Andrew fight, though satisfyingly edited and generally cool, makes frequent use of obvious stunt doubles and stand-ins. The open-ended ending leaves a bit to be desired, too...

While I consider this to be the best of the ""Universal Soldier"" series despite its DTV-ness, the film misses a perfect rating strictly because of its indulgence of a few unlikeable DTV traits - the ambiguity of the backstory, the stunt doubles in the rematch, etc. With the exception of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Tournament/dp/B002FOFX9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Tournament</a>, this is the best recent DTV movie I have seen this year, and fans of everybody involved should take notice. I daresay this film is strong enough even for newcomers to the series to acquaint themselves with the material before checking out the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier/dp/B00005O6Y3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier</a>&nbsp;if they so wish. Amazingly, this one is beyond being a labeled action vehicle for any specific star: it's an all-around cool action flick for both devotees and casual viewers to enjoy, even if they've never heard of the stars involved.",1266796800,,7327,6.02013422818792
3988257,5,B002U6CJCO,"I was pleasantly surprised with Universal Soldier: Regeneration. I expected a hokey borefest with minimal action and ended up watching one of the best films both Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren ever appeared in. I won't give away too much, largely because I'm tired and typing this at 6:22 AM after working my horrible late night shift. Basically, a recycled terrorist/kidnapping plot leads to lots of hardcore booty-kicking from MMA badass, Andrei Arlovski as the next generation UniSol. Eventually, Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) is re-juiced in order to take him on. Throw in a sick bonus battle with Lundgren and there you have it. The fight scenes with Lundgren and Arlovski are some of the grittiest I've seen in something that didn't come out of Hong Kong. Did Donnie Yen ghost-choreograph these battles that are loaded with cool MMA moves? Van Damme proves once again that he can rock when he has to  because Lundgren and Arlovski never let up on him. Overall, this is new-school grindhouse fun that will light up a Saturday afternoon. Toss in a Shaw Bros. classic and a schlocky horror film, pop some corn, and grab your favorite cold beverage.

I've been a fan of Jean Claude since a kid and I didn't hesitate to add this movie to my collection.

3988280,3,B002U6CJCO,"It's hard to believe but it's been 17 years since the first UNIVERSAL SOLDIER film came out. In that time both stars Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren have made a number of pictures, some bad, some good, some in between. Both have gone on to the direct to DVD stature. Oddly enough, some of the direct to DVD films have been better than those released theatrically. The same can be said of those featuring both stars. Does that hold true here?

The movie begins with terrorists kidnapping a teenage boy and girl to hold hostage. The children are the offspring of the country where the now famous city of Chernobyl is located. Famed for the accidental nuclear power plant leak, the plant remains to this day thought the city is deserted.

Demanding the release of their comrades in arms, the terrorists have placed explosive charges on the power plant and are willing to set them off should their demands not be met. Having the kids on board is sort of icing on the cake in an attempt to force the issue.

The U.S. military and that of the locals are brought in with an elite team to try and put an end to this situation. They bring along a four of the old universal soldiers (UniSols) from the past when they discover that one of the main enforcers for these terrorists is the next generation UniSol, the NGU or Next Generation UniSol as portrayed by MMA fighter Andrei ""The Pitbull"" Arlovski. These indestructible soldiers are built to withstand anything but the new generation exceeds the previous ones.

The NGU can withstand bullets and beatings and is controlled by a scientist who left the UniSol program feeling he wasn't appreciated and now out to earn money as a gun for hire so that he might finish his experiments. Of course the terrorists don't appreciate him any more than his previous employers did. As back up, he's brought along one of the old UniSols, Andrew (Dolph Lundgren).

When the elite U.S. team finds themselves shot to pieces and taken out by the one NGU, they make the decision to recruit the best of the best. That would be Luc Deveraux (Jean Claude Van Damme) who is in the middle of re-assimilation into the real world with the help of a psychiatrist. Realizing he is needed, months of work is tossed aside and enhancing drugs are used to bring him back to his full potential so that he might take out the terrorists.

Not only are fans of the series treated to Van Damme coming back in a role they loved, they get Lundgren back as his adversary as well. The two face off when Deveraux hits the abandoned power plant/city as Andrew now has a mind of his own and is searching for answers. A non-stop battle royal between the two has them bashing through walls, beating one another and falling from buildings only to get up and continue the battle.

Not only does Deveraux face Andrew though, keep in mind the NGU is out there waiting as well. So you get two big action packed face offs in this film for the price of one!

Does the movie hold up though? For a direct to DVD film it's not bad. There's plenty of action from start to finish. But on the whole it lacks some of the humor from the first film, some of the humanity, and feels more like people just bashing each other about than anything else.

Of the main characters Lundgren's comes off best with Andrew facing his past in his own mind. The questions posed to the UniSol's are one's he asks of his creators, questions about emotions the UniSol's aren't supposed to have and about the universe. Andrew wondered aloud about his place in the world and is tortured by his past. Lundgren, for an actor so many are willing to disregard as an action star, does a great job showing the torment of Andrew.

The same can't be said of Van Damme. His performance here displays little or nothing. The character is now devoid of any and all emotion, even during the scenes in which he is supposed to be rehabilitating himself. It's nothing more than jump, kick, spin with only sparse dialogue. We see nothing of what is going on inside Deveraux's mind. He returns to the killing machine seen at the beginning of the original film. Even an attempt to see some glimpse at the end offers little.

The movie is an action packed film. It does offer some great fight sequences. But for the most part it feels hollow. You're left with a feeling not that it's been done before but that there was no need for this film. Perhaps the words I'm looking for are cookie cutter. One part bad terrorists, one part main bad guy, one part good guy, toss into blender and make sure good guy wins. A simple formula that works, but in this case one that makes you wish for so much more.",1265673600,3,4648,4.46933962264151
3988281,1,B002U6CJCO,I cant believe that I used to be a fan of Van Damme. He is looking old now and it also shows in the work he does. This will be the last film of his that I will rent. This movie was awful and was not really his movie based on screentime. I don't expect to see Van Damme around much longer and he turned down a chance at a big screen comeback with Expendables. Seagal is almost a decade older than him and is back on the big screen in April in Machete and also has a tv series. I've heard that VD will also be in a reality tv show publicising his little fight against that featherweight hasbeen. Is there any doubt that VD will wipe the floor with him and try to make himself look like a real martial artist on the series. Its almost like a saturday morning cartoon.,1265673600,,764,4.0
3988282,4,B002U6CJCO,"The first Universal Soldier is, and has always been one of my favorite action movies of all time.  And although this one has many differences from its original, it did not dissapoint an avid fan like me.  For a direct to video feature, I was very impressed with the overall look, and feel of the movie.  If you're looking for action, you will very happy with this one.  The fights have been updated.  Gone are the slow motion roundhouses, and somewhat predictable Van Damme fight scenes.  The battles are quick, realistic, and very violent (thumbs up).
But I should say, for fans of the original like myself hoping to see a continuing story will be dissapointed.  There is no mention, or connection to the events of the first US, other than Lundgren, and his time is short lived. Whitch is a shame because he was an awesome villian in the first.  Add to that, the ending is very open ended, and you are left with no closure on Van Damme's character of Luc.  However, if that means another sequel, I won't complain.  Van Damme's still got it!",1265673600,2,1041,4.518716577540107
3988283,3,B002U6CJCO,"It's been almost two decades since the hugely entertaining UNIVERSAL SOLDIER came out, and action film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are a bit grayer now and less buff. This latest addition to the franchise reunites the two, and I'm tempted to compare it to GRUMPY OLD MEN but with more vicious knees to the skull. However, this is a humorless movie and Van Damme and Lundgren spend more time trading in mean-intentioned bear hugs than in dialogue. In fact, for a lead guy, Van Damme isn't in the film as much as you'd think, and Lundgren even less. And the scene they share is basically this one extended brawl.

The strengths of UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENERATION all have to do with the action sequences, the fighty fights involving Van Damme, Lundgren, and the two mixed martial arts fighters Mike Pyle (as a merely human commando) and especially Andrei ""the Pit Bull"" Arlovski. Arlovski as the main bad guy, with his menacing size, is an imposing fighting machine. Compared to him, Van Damme and Lundgren look mediocre, if spry for their age.

But the story kills you with its lethargic pace. The plot kicks off with the abduction of the Ukraine Prime Minister's children and the kidnappers-terrorists taking over the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The bad guys have gotten hold of an upgraded Universal Soldier (Arlovski), and not even a squad of first generation UniSols can stand up to him. The regular military troops, of course, are like cannon fodder. What's left is ex-UniSol operative Luc Deveraux, long in the tooth and still undergoing rehabilitation thru psychological and medical therapy. Note that this third installment blatantly ignores the events that took place in the first sequel (UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN), so I guess Luc never did have a daughter or a normal life beyond his military and UniSol days.

UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENERATION shifts back and forth between Luc Deveraux's reluctantly coming back to the fold and the drawn out hostage rescue ops. And then, nearly an hour into it, Dolph enters the picture, and I guess his character Sgt. Andrew Scott is so tough that he can even survive getting his important bits chewed up in a hay harvester (okay, the film does explain it away by pulling the clone card). It's reassuring to know that some things never change, because the good sergeant is as mentally effed up as ever and I'm only surprised that he doesn't right away start chopping ears off his victims for his grossass necklace. Oh, and there's a bomb.

Filmed in Bulgaria and with huge chunks shot in an abandoned industrial plant, there's a bleak, wintry look and feel to the movie. Add in the many slow, momentum-killing moments and also that the stabs at character development are as convincing as the wacky science revolving around the UniSol project, and this Direct-to-DVD film was well on its way to becoming a very shabby sequel. Thankfully, the fighty fights are done well and infuse kinetic energy onto the screen. Weapons are fired, but mostly the UniSols engage in brutal hand-to-hand skirmishes, one of which results in one of the best kills I've seen on film in years.

I wonder, though, how exactly is Arlovski's character an upgrade from the first generation UniSols. Far as I can tell, there's that wrist bayonet, and maybe the scientists now feed their subjects more Wheaties so they can grow as tall as Arlovski. Other than that, it's the same-ol', same-ol' zombie soldier. But what they all seem to have in common is the habit of holding their opponent down with one hand while whaling away with the other. Sounds like an MMA move.

There's talk of possibly doing another sequel, I guess depending on how this one performs in video sales. I may have dissed UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: REGENERATION a bit, but it honestly isn't as bad as I'd initially feared. Based on it, I'm cautiously for another sequel.

The DVD bonus features have the ""Behind the Lines,"" which is the Making Of the film segment (almost 19 minutes long), and audio commentary by Director John Hyams and Dolph Lundgren.",1265414400,4,4058,4.863965267727931

3988288,4,B002U6CJCO,"I honestly don't know what I'm more shocked by, the fact that I gave Universal Soldier: Regeneration a chance, or the fact that it turned out to be as good as it is.  When a group of terrorists take over the Chernobyl nuclear reactor and threaten to release a radioactive cloud, and with an uber-advanced UniSol (former UFC champ Andrei ""The Pitbull"" Arlovski) at their disposal, former, deactivated UniSol Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) gets called back into action.  However, there's a surprise in store for Luc, in the form of his once deceased nemesis Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren) who has been cloned and reanimated, and looking to bring some pain of his own.  While all this sounds like the recipe of a low budget, direct-to-DVD, schlock fest featuring two action stars way past their primes, Universal Soldier: Regeneration ends up surpassing both of the films to come before it, thanks to the great directing from John Hyams, who not only manages to put together some just plain brutal action sequences, but also manages to coax some great performances from Van Damme and Lundgren, as well as take advantage of Arlovski's cold menace.  John's father Peter Hyams, who directed Van Damme in 90s actioners Timecop and Sudden Death, serves as the film's cinematographer, and helps give the film the surprisingly great look that it has: this certainly doesn't look like a low budget, direct-to-DVD film.
