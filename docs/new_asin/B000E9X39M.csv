8107798,5,B000E9X39M,"Although previously stated from prior reviews, too short a video - instructor is not clear enough, etc. I assure you, this is a good Martial Arts video! This video not only gives you a very good view of one of the many Japanese blade arts. But an inkling into the Japanese Martial Arts culture itself. That's one of the many beautiful facets of the Martial Arts. You get a glimpse, into another culture. Gain an idea about the people who designed this art. When they created it, and why they created it! Here, in the Japanese weapons art of Tanto Jitsu. The demonstration and instruction of the basic stances/postures are more than invaluable enough, let alone the actual striking techniques themselves. The 'Kamae' ( or postures ) show how a strike can be implemented, let alone with proper balance & leverage. The instruction by Hanshi Ken Penland, is per -
formed quite well. Clearly and fully explicit. However, although previously stated about 'breathing problems'. Hampering and impeding proper clear tutelage. I found no problems, however, Hanshi Penland did have a very coarse and hoarse voice ( sadly, this video was made just a little bit before Hanshi Penland's death ). And there is a bit of a hinderance in his parlaying information. But other than that, this is a very good video on the Japanese Martial Arts ( Budo ). There might be a little confusion in the presentation of this video, for example. Hanshi Penland's Tanto ( Japanese fighting knife ) is larger than his students. You see, there are varying sizes of tang design for the 'Tanto'. Which is why I must insist on purchasing a book on the Japanese Tanto. I know, I know. In my youth, I never really was much of a reader myself ( even though I grew up to become a writer and author ). But please, I have to insist. Go out and get this video, along with a book on tantos as well!! You could go to your local library and check one out, but why? If you purchased the video, buy the book as well! Your knowledge of this art will not just double, but triple as well!!! And last but not least, this art isn't as difficult as you might think it is. It can act as a supplement for Martial Arts without weaponry. Plus most important of all, it's a lot of fun ( at least in my opinion ).",1447632000,,2252,4.468446601941747
