5914932,3,B00EHMYK6W,"""The History of the WWE"" is a three-disc set consisting of a two-hour documentary (Disc 1) and fourteen matches or highlights from WWE programming (Discs 2 and 3).  The video and audio quality of the matches and television highlights are consistent with other WWE DVDs and constrained by the eras in which they were originally recorded.

The documentary is a linear history of the WWE, from the early 1960s to the present day.  For a long-time WWE fan, the highlight of the documentary is the first twenty minutes.  It reviews an era that has not been mined by previous WWE DVD releases. There are chapters on  Jess McMahaon and Vince McMahon, Sr. building the company, Bruno Sammartino's reign as champion, and the company's dominance in the northeast United States in the 1960s and 1970s.  Highlights of these sections are interviews with key figures--Sammartino, Jimmy Valiant, Larry Zybsko and Bob Backlund,--who have not appeared on previous releases.  These interviews and clips of archival footage make me hopeful we'll see future releases with these wrestlers and that era.  After this too-brief overview of the first twenty five years of the company, the documentary focuses on the Wrestlemania era.  However, this material has been extensively reviewed in previous DVD releases (e.g., ""The Monday Night War"", ""The History of Wrestlemania"" and ""McMahon""), and although there are some new interviews, including Vince Russo, there's little novel insight in this documentary.

A major weakness of the documentary is its perspective:  It is an autobiography from the company and too often reflects the WWE corporate line.  Much of the last thirty minutes plays like a standard public relations piece.  Few from outside the WWE's family are interviewed and criticisms and critiques are mild, at best.  WWE's dominance over regional territories in the 1980s was the result of health competition, but WCW's superiority in the late 1990s came from unfair and unethical business practices according to this video.  The documentary covers the steroid trial of the 1990s, but attributes it solely to a rogue doctor from Pennsylvania and implies that drugs have been eliminated from the company for twenty years.  It frames the death of Owen Hart on its impact on the McMahon family.  While there are glimpses of Eddie Guerrero in archival footage, the deaths of Guerrero and Chris Benoit are not mentioned at all.  A ""hit job"" on the WWE is not needed, but a documentary titled ""The History of WWE"" needed direction from an independent voice.  This is a documentary that required a filmmaker that had access to the WWE archives and current personnel, but also the freedom to interview outsiders (e.g., Dave Meltzer, Jim Cornette and Irv Muchnick) who have a different perspective on WWE and its history.  Overall, an outsider's perspective was needed for a historical review.

Several Amazon reviewers have critically commented on the match and highlight selections on Discs 2 and 3.  There is only one match from the first twenty-five years of the company, Sammartino versus Bill Graham in 1977, and it has been included on previous DVD releases.  The documentary states several times that the company preserves an immense video library and it would have been great to see early material from the start of the company in Washington and matches with Backlund, Antonio Rocca, Buddy Rogers and Gorilla Monsoon.

Overall, ""The History of the WWE"" DVD set was a missed opportunity.  With its media library, financial resources and media expertise, the company could have comissioned a documentary that critically analyzed the company's key role in changing popular culture and professional sports.  This is fertile ground for a film on the positives and negatives of an American success story.",1385078400,26,3787,5.167213114754098
5914933,4,B00EHMYK6W,There are many different complaints about this DvD/Blu Ray and its chosen matches but those are from viewers that didn't quite get the concept of this documentary. This is about GREATS AND FIRSTS! On this set (which is actually quite good compared to other WWE releases as far as the main feature goes) you aren't going to have some obscure Mr. Fuji vs. Baron Mikel Scicluna match from 1978 that emanated from MSG on the extras. This DvD is highlighting the best superstars and the new things that happened in WWE history.  The only complaint that I have is that they should have shown some older great moments like Buddy Rogers becoming champ or Bruno Sammartino becoming champ for the first time in its entirety in the extras. Other than that this documentary does exactly what it is supposed to: SHOWCASE GREAT MOMENTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WWE!,1384819200,6,848,4.691275167785235
5914934,1,B00EHMYK6W,This is just ridiculous. Once again they have made a mockery of the wrestling fan. One pre-Hogan era match. One! Another blown opportunity to give us old school fans what we want and introduce the young ones to the greatness of earlier wrestlers instead of just relying on the stories we have to tell them. What a waste.,1383091200,8,320,4.5344827586206895
5914935,5,B00EHMYK6W,"This is going to be an amazing dvd! WWE's history is so compelling that it's hard not to get goosebumps when thinking about all the historical events that occurred in the past 50 years! I can't wait to purchase this on November 19, 2013!!!!!!!!!!",1382054400,,246,4.613636363636363
5914936,1,B00EHMYK6W,"I can't believe the WWE has dropped the ball yet again on what could have been a great DVD set.  First they dropped the ball on the MSG set and now this set.  Unreal!!  Instead of some new and unreleased matches we get the same old same old.  I don't know if it's because they can release matches now without the blurring of the scratch logo and without WWF being bleeped out but please WWE, please release some other stuff then the same old tried and true stuff.

The documentary does seem a bit interesting but not enough for me to buy this set.  Let's just see what this set has on it, shall we?

The first match you get is when Bruno dropped the world title to Superstar Billy Graham in Baltimore.  How many times do they have to show this match?  It is not one of the greatest matches in the world, in fact it is kind of slow and boring.  They could have found another match from each of these guys to put on here instead of this one again.

Up next is when Hogan took on Andre from Wrestlemania III.  Really?  Again?  This is another match where it's like how many times do we have to see it.  I get that WM III was a big WM but for the love of God we have seen this match so many times on other sets and tapes that honestly it needs to be retired.

The next match is the 1988 Royal Rumble match.  Another head scratcher.  Why in the world is this match on there.  It wasn't that good and honestly, if they want to put a Rumble match on this set why not pick something better than this one.

The next match is from the first Raw and features Yokozuna taking on Koko B Ware.  Wow that should be a real treat!  Please this match was terrible.  What in the world was the WWE thinking.

Then we get to see, yet again, the King of the Ring finals between Steve Austin and Jake Roberts.  Again, how many times do we have to see this match.  I understand it had a great interview at the end but the match itself is a waste of space.

The next match is from Survivor Series 1997 and is the infamous screw job match with Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels.  It has been released on DVD before but not very many times, I think just once on the Confidental DVD and then only on Blu Ray, so it is nice to see this on a regular DVD set.  It's not that great of a match though so again it kind of boggles the mind why it's on here.

Next we get to Tyson and Austin from Raw in 1998 yet again.  Geez, how many times do we have to see this angle?

The next match is Triple H taking on the Rock from Smackdown in 1999.  Again, not that great of a match (they would have better ones).  Not sure if this one has been released before or not but still they could have chosen a better match.

Next we get Vince talking about how he purchased Nitro on Raw.  This hasn't been released too many times but it's been shown so many times on TV and documentaries that it's another segment that's getting tired.

The next match is when Hogan took on Rock from Wrestlemania 18.  Again, how many times do they have to release this one before they retire it.  It is a great match but it's one that we've seen over and over again.

The next match is from Wrestlemania 23 when Vince and Donald Trump put up their hair when their seconds (Bobby Lashley and Umaga) wrestled each other.  This one hasn't been released before and is worth seeing.  I liked the match especially the ending.

The next match is a 6 man tag from Tribute to the Troops.  It has John Cena, Batista and Rey Mysterio taking on Chris Jericho, Big Show and Randy Orton.  This is a good match and actually worth checking out.

The next segment we get is when CM Punk did his whole ""pipe bomb"" interview.  Again, this segment has been rehashed and replayed so many times it isn't funny.

Lastly from this year we get Punk taking on John Cena in a #1 contender match from Raw.  Great match and well worth checking out.  These two, IMO, have never had a bad match with each other and this one here was one of the best.

As far as Blu Ray releases go it's not much better.  The first match you get is the Floyd Mayweather/Big Show match from Wrestlemania 24.  Really?  This match sucked and seeing a little 140 pound guy going over on Show is just stupid and insults the fan's intelligence.

Lastly we get the Undertaker taking on Shawn Michaels from Wrestlemania 25.  This match is a great match but is now starting to be seend too many times as well.

While I don't think anyone in the WWE actually gets on Amazon and reads the reviews we put out there, I wish they would.  Maybe they could learn what the fans actually want and what they want.  They had a golden opportunity here and a whole vault of material that has never been seen before and instead they decide to go ahead and put matches on here that we've seen a thousand times.  I, for one, will not be getting this set when it comes out because it's not gonna be worth it unless they sell it for like $3.00.",1381536000,30,4898,4.1369426751592355
5914937,2,B00EHMYK6W,"I really wish the WWE would stop putting the same old matches on every single dvd that comes out!!! Seriously,how many times can Hulk and Andre be shown?!?!?",1381363200,16,157,4.642857142857143
5914938,2,B00EHMYK6W,"This match selection is horrible. I want to see rare matches that are not on previous WWE releases or Coliseum Video Releases. So much history yet this is what they give us. I think I'm going to pass on this one, and I don't say that lightly as I have purchased every other WWE release. Did we really need to see  Hogan vs. Andre again? How many times have they released that same Sammartino vs. Graham match? Why can't we get some of the rarely seen classics?",1381190400,21,460,4.287356321839081

Overall, this set looks pretty good. There is way to many repeat matches but remember they don't have to blur out the WWF logo or edit when a wrestler or annoucer say WWF so that's one thing to look foward to. Aside from Mayweather VS Big Show & Yoko-Ware I like the matches selected. I'll pick this up on release day for the documentary.",1381190400,37,2229,4.78740157480315

This is a three dvd set of fifty years of the wwe, and other then the first dvd which told me alot that I didn't know which I loved, the other two dvds in the set was a let down don't get me wrong there were some things in the other two dvds I liked but for the most part they were repeats of what I have in my wrestlemania collection.  I would have liked more footage from the past like the seventies and some of the early eighties type of stuff which I don't see much of if any or at least have more of a setup like they did with talking about Bret heart and the Montreal screw job and then showing the match, that was great as I have never seen that match, but always hear about them talking about it now I can see why Bret was so upset, plus they were being cheap with the number of matches per dvd it was like they where just trying to fill space not really putting thought into them like they do for the wrestlemania three dvd sets.",1393459200,2,987,3.93

Vince McMahon better get smart and realize he is not the catalyst for the WWWF,s success but the wrestlers of the 60,s and 70,s who,s blood and sweat did .NO where on here is a match with Professor Tanaka,Pedro Morales,Victor Rivera,Don Leo Jonathan,The Valiant Brothers who pushed tag teams to another level.

Where are the Russians and Nikita Multivich,Where is Don Jardeen as The Spoiler without his mask.

The match selection definitely leaves something to be desired but we all have to remember something: These matches were picked to represent an important part of WWE history and will of course been see alot before. Important events like the first Royal Rumble Match, first match ever on Raw, Montreal Screwjob, etc. This wasn't meant to be a rareties collection.

Champion, how Vince Sr. kept his word to Jimmy Valant, the story of the McMahon's bankruptcy in the 1970's, the origins of Titan Sports including where the name came from, tales of Vince McMahon heavy involvement with talent promos including never before seen footage of him helping talents including Hulk Hogan & Razor Ramon, and super fans telling their favorite moments from WWE events. It should also be noted that in past presentations that all post-2008 HD-TV footage is shown in the widescreen format while the footage before that was presented with side bars but all footage throughout the main documentary is shown in the widescreen format without sidebars.

Normally I leave my summary for the end of my review but just based off the other heavily negative reviews alone, I'll state it now as I need to state what should be the common sense in that the name of this DVD set is ""History Of The WWE: 50 Years Of Sports Entertainment"" & not ""WWE Unreleased by (insert reviewer name here)"" as this is about the most memorable matches & moments that impacted WWE & changed history throughout their entire existence which means that a match that broke the indoor sporting event attendance record or match that reflects the beginnings of the two longest running weekly episodic television series in history has more validation to be on here than some random match that most people don't know existed regardless if you logic is ""I don't have that one yet."" Now my personal criticisms were that some subjects being omitted such as going public admitting that this is an entertainment industry, their non-wrestling ventures like the World Bodybuilding Federation & XFL, the name change from WWF to WWE, the Wellness Policy while I would have preferred if we got the main event of the first RAW (Undertaker vs. Damien Demento) & the main event of the SmackDown pilot special (Rock & Austin vs. Undertaker & Triple H) instead of the choices they made to represent that because you would have gotten the same point across while I would have added a match from Saturday Night's Main Event but one major positive I saw was that they didn't spend a huge amount of time on certain subjects that have been talked about numerous times in the past like the Montreal Screwjob with even Shawn saying ""you've read all the books & seen all the DVD's"" & spent the most time on subjects that haven't been talked about much in the past.

The documentary begins with the visual of Vince McMahon arriving & going to his office in WWE Headquarters before starting to talk about the beginnings with Jess McMahon & Capitol Wrestling along with Vince Sr. being a man of his word & how he treated his talent like family before going into the reasons for the split away from the National Wrestling Alliance & the circumstances behind the title reign of Buddy Rogers followed by the impact of Bruno Sammartino as far as his following & celebrity status along with the importance of the wrestling magazines & Madison Square Garden then the influx of new talent throughout the 70's from Bob Backlund as champion to the debut of Sgt. Slaughter & impact of Andre The Giant. Vince McMahon Jr.'s takeover of the wrestling industry was talked about next as far as the different avenues he used with the reaction & even threats made towards people who ""sold out"" to him was heavily discussed along with impact of cable & syndication before going into the impact of Hulk Hogan with this charisma & crossover ability leading into the first WrestleMania talking about how it was a ""make it or break it"" event & how much revenue was actually made from the show & the impact made to the point where the aftermath of wrestling being more acceptable was discussed as far as Saturday Night's Main Event, wrestlers having celebrity status, and the different avenues of revenue & entertainment WWE crossed over into. WrestleMania III was discussed next as far as the record setting indoor attendance record & the Hogan/Andre main event along with other memories of the event opening the door to their pay-per-view expansion throughout the years before heavily discussing the steroid trial with the various talents talking about if they did it & the justification behind their decision along with who would have taken over WWE if Vince was found guilty followed by the aftermath as far as ""pressing the reset"" button with a new generation of fresh faces & younger talent leading into the creation of Monday Night RAW & how it's original concept was compared to a popular MTV show at that time. The creation of WCW Nitro & the Monday Night War was discussed next with different tactics WCW used to gain an advantage & how that effected the Montreal Screwjob changing WWE's direction into the Attitude Era was discussed as far as the maturity level of the product & they heavy amount of fan participation before going into the death of Owen Hart, the goal of creating SmackDown & it's memorable show two days after the 9/11 tragedy. WWE's expansion into public trading on Wall Street & books was discussed before going into the details of how the end of World Championship Wrestling & Extreme Championship Wrestling opened the doors for the brand extension with various superstars & World Champions admitting that gave more opportunities followed by a discussion about the product going TV-PG & John Cena being the current face of WWE along with the huge amount of charity causes WWE supports including Be A Star & the annual Tribute To The Troops show. The high demand of WrestleMania being moved back into stadiums is talked about along with the traditional Hall Of Fame ceremony before talking about their venture into the film industry dating back to No Holds Barred & The Rock followed by WWE adapting to the future through either technology with their social media & High Definition transition or their talent with NXT & The Performance Center with the documentary ending on celebrities & talent reflecting on the 50 years of World Wrestling Entertainment.

Matches Include:
WWE Champion Bruno Sammartino vs. Billy Graham - The first moments of the match started out with both men having more than one test of strength before each man went into their individual strategies of Graham working over the throat area with chops & using the ring ropes while Bruno kept using Graham's own momentum against him focusing on his back with strikes & power like the bearhug. This was a good match for it's time but more about the history making result.

[History Of The WWE Championship; 20 Years Too Soon: The ""Superstar"" Billy Graham Story]

WWE Champion Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The Giant - This was (and arguably still is) the biggest match in the history of professional wrestling as it headlined the 93,000+ indoor attendance record. Hogan went for a slam in the opening moments leading to a controversial moment early in the match before Andre continued to beat on Hogan's back to the point where he literally just walked all over him. Whatever momentum Hogan attempted to gain was constantly stopped by Andre causing Hogan to get desperate with a piledriver attempt on the concrete floor only for Andre to again overpower him. The match was your stereotypical ""Hogan"" performance but this was more about the attraction of two giant names in the industry against each other on a huge state.
It should be noted that the version of this match presented has no commentary & is completely shown through the ""hard camera"" angle only so it's a different presentation than previously seen.
Wrestlemania III
[Hulk Still Rules; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; True Story Of WrestleMania; History Of The WWE Championship]

Royal Rumble Match - This was the first ever Royal Rumble battle royal that had 20 participants (before moving to the traditional number of 30) that had it's highlights such as the first two men who started the contest, the alliances throughout the such as those who were unlikely along with a tag team who stuck together to last a long time in the match, an argument over who's the legal participant, a fight that one man got into on the outside before even entering the ring, and some rivalries revisited. This match is a rarity because this entire event wasn't a PPV but a cable television special that wasn't even released onto VHS or DVD outside of the Royal Rumble anthology so it's just interesting to watch to see where this concept started & evolved into to over 30 years later.
Royal Rumble '88

Koko B. Ware vs. Yokozuna - This was nothing more than a squash so it wasn't anything important quality wise but as far as it's importance to WWE & relevancy to this presentation is that this was the first ever match to start the longest running weekly episodic television series in history.
""RAW"" Jan. '93

Jake Roberts vs. Steve Austin - This was the final match of the annual King Of The Ring tournament with Jake going into the match with ribs that were heavily injured by Vader earlier in the night while Austin's lip was patched up from being busted open earlier in the night. Austin was completely ruthless here & the perfect heel against Jake who refused to quit despite the referee & even President Gorilla Monsoon coming out to check up on him as Jake was after his own ""Cinderella"" story as Austin kept focusing on Jake's ribs. When all was said & done, Austin 3:16 was born.

WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels - 18 months in the making with the special conditions that this was to be one on one with no outside interference with Shawn ""being Shawn"" on the way to the ring & completely disrespecting the Canadian flag. This was going to be a war & you could tell that right away as they had a match before the actual match got started. Both men started brawling everywhere with the fans getting their punches in at Shawn in the crowd, both men being thrown into the steps & ringpost while also being choked with flags, backstage referees & officials like Pat Patterson getting hit for getting in the way of these two, and Bret trying to break Shawn's leg with the figure four around the post like he did months earlier. However, it was the final moment of this match & what happened afterwords that will always have this moment live on as the ""Montreal Screwjob.""
Survivor Series '97
[Best Of Confidential; Blu-Ray Edition Of Greatest Rivalries: Shawn Michaels vs. Bret Hart]

WWE Champion Triple H vs. The Rock - This was the main event on the first ""regular"" episode of SmackDown with the twist of Commissioner Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. This was exactly what you would expect from a HHH/Rock match in that they put on a solid encounter (like they usually do) with Shane McMahon & Chyna getting involved at times before you saw an ending that you didn't expect at that time and really set the stage for what WWE wanted to do in making SmackDown a show where you had to tune in & see what happens.
""SmackDown"" Aug. '99
[Best Of SmackDown: 10th Anniversary]

The Rock vs. Hollywood Hulk Hogan - Despite Hogan's actions going into this match, he was clearly the crowd favorite from the start which helped build his momentum as Hogan kept knocking Rock down showing his strength which caused Rock to rebound with his athleticism as he knocked Hogan down with a running flying clothesline & punched Hogan out the ring as they kept trading momentum with one man taking the other down & beating on each other in the corner only for the other to return the favor right afterwords. Hogan was able to gain the advantage with his power using a chokeslam to power Rock down before using dirty tactics such as choking with the wrist tape, a low blow, using his weight belt, and stealing Rock's own Rock Bottom but The Rock recovered using the belt against Hogan along with his Rock Bottom before Hogan did his classic ""Hulking Up"" followed by the big boot & leg drop which the Rock kicked out of & came back with two back to back Rock Bottom & People's Elbow. Jerry Lawler had the one line after this match that perfectly describes this match, ""It did more than live up to the hype, it surpassed it"" as Hogan brought his A game here that we hadn't seen dating back to possibly the early days of WCW while the crowd so so heavily into it that Jim Ross called it perfectly when he said ""this is a WrestleMania moment"" when Hogan & Rock didn't even touch each other yet the crowd was going wild. The audience reacted to every move they made from picking the side that wasn't planned before going into this match to how they went crazy for everything that happened after the match as everything resulted in a positive in the end as The Rock got that important WrestleMania win that kept alluding his throughout his career while Hogan regained his fans.
It should also be noted that this was the first time since the original PPV DVD that this match was released unedited with no blurring of the Attitude Era logo along with Hogan's original nWo theme playing during his entrance.

[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment; Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology; True Story Of WrestleMania]

""Battle Of The Billionaries"" Hair vs. Hair Match with special referee Stone Cold Steve Austin - Umaga w/Vince McMahon vs. Lashley w/Donald Trump - If you eliminate all the hype featuring McMahon/Trump...this was just an average match as Lashley & Umaga didn't really do anything here outside of their normal routine to the point where the match got dull at times & Shane McMahon's ""Coast 2 Coast"" was the most impressive move in the bout. The eventual ending happened with Umaga getting a stunner & spear before Mr. McMahon got a ""Mr. Clean"" haircut...and Donald Trump got a stunner.
WrestleMania 23

John Cena, Batista, & Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho, Big Show & Randy Orton - This was just a fun six man tag match with both teams trading momentum & each man having their showcase moment with the story of the match being one set of partners working as a team while the other just kept having problems with either communication & their own egos.
""Tribute To The Troops"" Dec. '08

John Cena vs. C.M. Punk - The winner of this match would go on to to face The Rock for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania XXIX as both men started off exchanging exchanges & didn't stop from there as this was a match that had both men going back & forth with momentum non-stop in regards to either grounded offense such as the front facelock & side headlock to submissions like the Anaconda Vice & STF to impactful moves such as the suicide dive & piledriver to their signature moves of the Attitude Adjustment & Go To Sleep as Cena was trying to work a faster pace pulling out moves that we rarely or haven't seen from him before while Punk was more slow & methodical targeting Cena's neck including one move that is so dangerous that it's shortened & ended careers in the past. Punk & Cena just have this natural chemistry with each other bringing out some of their best performances in their WWE careers with this being no exception.
""RAW"" Feb. '13

(Blu-Ray) Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather vs. Big Show - Well this was the best ""worked"" boxing influenced match I've seen in wrestling but considering how crappy the other ones were, that's not much of a compliment. The match was entertaining for what it was once they got away from trying to make it a look like a real ""shoot"" match & started getting entertaining with Mayweather's crew getting involved at times with chairs & brass knucks coming into play. Too bad they didn't book Mayweather as the heel in this feud, as he is just a natural in that role, because I got a guilty pleasure out of Big Show chopping & just manhandling him at times. In the end, this match was like the Billionaires match last year where it was about the the hype of the celebrity appearance to draw money instead of having a high quality match so with that in consideration, this was an entertaining match for what it was...and at least he didn't have to see Big Show in a diaper unlike his celebrity match at WrestleMania 21.
WrestleMania XXIV
[Big Show: A Giant's World]

(Blu-Ray) Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker - This is one of those matches that I can try to describe & review but the words wouldn't do it justice. This match had everything (including the unique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the closest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago & Shawn was even so desperate at one point, he was hoping for a win via countout. Instant classic here & quite frankly, this was the match that saved this show, should have ended it since nobody was going to be able to top it, and makes the DVD worth buying alone.
WrestleMania 25
[Shawn Michaels: My Journey]

Now overall I enjoyed the documentary presentation while the extras for the most part were quality in their own right for either the in-ring action or it's significance so in the end I recommend this presentation but for those heavy DVD collectors who have issues with the extras chosen (as we've seen with previous reviews before the documentary was released) then it's worth a stream or rental.",1385683200,7,19410,4.75348561257787

It looks like it was shot from a camcorder in the crowd and there is no commentary from the announcers.  I know WWE has a habit of deleting Jesse Ventura's comments so they don't have to pay him royalties, but they removed Gorilla Monsoon's comments as well.  Couldn't they have at least gotten Jim Ross or someone else to supply new commentary?  And why did they replace the original video with this camcorder footage?
