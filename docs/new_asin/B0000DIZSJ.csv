1925455,4,B0000DIZSJ,"I watched this series when it was originally on air and enjoyed it immensely.  The item was sold as ""new"" but the packaging was sort of krinkled and didn't look new, but that's not really a problem for me except I planned on using this as a gift.  For myself as long as the disks are in good, clean condition I'm satisfied.  Loved the series, happy with the swiftness of delivery.",1381190400,,380,4.323943661971831
1925456,5,B0000DIZSJ,"I loved the original Connections series many years ago and I was given one episode of the Connections 2 series years ago.  So when I found the whole of the 3 series, I went for it.  I have not regretted any of the purchased DVDs in the least bit.  I love James Burke, I love the concept of the series, and I love the fast-paced timing.

I will admit that you might notice he connects stirrups and the steam engine to several other advancements often and there is some repetition in the 3 series, but over the 3 series, he sure makes a lot of very interesting connections among all the invention of humans cross the years.

I am glad to have all three and you should give them all a try too.",1370908800,,690,4.157894736842105
1925457,4,B0000DIZSJ,"We didn't know they had made a third series, so we were glad to see this one. The connections are definitely reaching a bit, but still fascinating to see how unexpected parts of our world connect to each other.",1367193600,,210,4.410256410256411
1925458,5,B0000DIZSJ,"Never saw these shows, but loved the Connections 2 episodes back in the 80s on PBS.  More great work from James Burke",1353110400,,117,4.318181818181818
1925459,5,B0000DIZSJ,This is by far the best series ever on TV. Came on time...was as expected. Enjoyed it thoroughly and will continue to do so.,1340236800,,124,4.208333333333333
1925460,5,B0000DIZSJ,Used to watch this show when I was younger and is was great.  Purchasing and watching the digital video disks was great. The menu setup on the disks was great.,1339545600,,159,4.3
1925461,1,B0000DIZSJ,We only received one disk of a five disk set.  Please correct.  It is extremely difficult to reach a real person to settle this problem.  We are severely tested by the limited options of communicating with amazon.,1323561600,,213,4.702702702702703
1925462,5,B0000DIZSJ,"This is an excellent documentary series, a must watch for anyone interested in the history of innovation and technology.  The series illustrates how inventions in the distant past connect to the technologies we use today.",1313884800,,221,5.314285714285714
1925463,2,B0000DIZSJ,"I really enjoyed James Burke's first series, ""The Day the Universe Change"". Then he did Connections I, II and III. Connections I was decent. However, Connections II and III were less than interesting. Because each episode was so boring, I often quit watching them before getting to the end. Definitely not worth the price of $80. In fact, knowing what I now know, even $15 is too much for II and III.",1305331200,2,400,4.569444444444445
1925464,5,B0000DIZSJ,"Although a bit on the pricey side, all the Connections series are simply amazing and well worth the investment! I had originally only seen Connections 3 on TLC when it first aired some years ago while I was a poor college student. Now that I am finally able to afford such an expense it's wonderful to see it still around with all its glory. I bought all three seasons and have enjoyed *all* of them immensely! They have unmatched re-playability and are simply engaging from the very beginning to the very end of each episode. James Burke is as fun to watch as ever and, as always, brings his great sense of humor and class to your television in this amazing series! I am so glad to have been able to purchase these along with ""The Day the Universe Changed"" series before any of them went out of print, if they're even at risk of doing so. A big thanks to Amazon for carrying a wonderful product, and a big big thanks to James Burke for everything he brought to these programs!! Awesome!",1281657600,,987,4.398907103825136
1925465,5,B0000DIZSJ,A truly enticing view of human inovation and developement.  The Connections series are the best of what television has to offer.  I will miss Burke's genius.,1277683200,,157,5.0
1925466,5,B0000DIZSJ,I had watched these programs over the years and was hoping for the day when they would be available on DVD as my old VHS tapes were in sorry shape. The price was fantastic and they arrived sooner than expected. I would HIGHLY recommend these DVDs to any fan of Mr. Burke's and encourage you to also read his books. The DVDs and the books will surely stand the test of time as a treasured addition to your video and library collection.,1269043200,,434,4.304878048780488
1925467,1,B0000DIZSJ,"The original PBS ""Connections"" is the only one to buy. Numbers II and III are largely retreads of the first with the third, courtesy of The Learning Channel, insultingly dumbed down. The power of Burke's original series was in his apparently meandering narratives that came together at stunning points to create a teachable moment. TLC apparently believes that its audience is idiots because they have forced Burke, in his videotaped remake (the first series was shot on film) to pause every few minutes to recap. I'm glad they paid him for the work, but not how they made him earn it. (This is also why one should be very discerning when buying videos from TLC or its sister company, The Discovery Channel). On the other hand, the white leisure suit in ""Connections I"" was a little weird.",1261958400,29,789,4.766423357664234
1925468,5,B0000DIZSJ,I was hooked as soon as I saw one episode years ago.  Had to have the whole collection,1223769600,,86,3.7777777777777777
1925469,5,B0000DIZSJ,"First off, I like to say the first time saw the Connections series I was hooked. When Connections 2 & 3 came out I had to watch them as well as the series The Day the Universe Changed. James Burke really knows how to make history interesting. He made connections you wouldn't see or even think about. Wish he made more of this kind of stuff can't get enough if it.

OK, now a word of warning. These great series are now public domain; people are starting to put together copies of their own disks and selling them. These copies may not be of good quality and may even be duplicates of the disks made by Ambruse Video. If you see a new seller or just listed with a price less than $80 it is probably one of these copies and I don't recommend buying them.",1190332800,11,753,4.157534246575342
1925470,4,B0000DIZSJ,"I am writing this in response to a recent review where the reviewer stated 2 things:
1- that connections 1 is not out on DVD.- NOT TRUE. they don't sell it on amazon but try googling it and you'll find other sellers (I assume I cannot mention any - buy HEY AMAZON why don't YOU sell it?)
and 2- (the reviewer is right that) Connections 1 is by far the best of the 3 sets. Granted, I saw it first, but the other two are watered down versions of similar stuff. If you can only get 1, get connections 1.
update: amazon is finally selling connections 1 but for some reason I am not able to review it",1154131200,17,595,4.0508474576271185
1925471,4,B0000DIZSJ,"James Burke's Connections 3 is another entertaining way to learn.  Not as tightly linked as his previous series.  Too bad he sold out to The Learning Channel (TLC).  It was pretty blatant when he held a mug with the TLC logo next to his face.

The world is still waiting for the release of the first, and best, series, Volume 1 of Connections.  I will definitely be in line to buy that one.  I presume that it's being held up for copyright issues.",1151539200,4,447,4.325301204819277
1925472,5,B0000DIZSJ,"The previous reviewer appears to have accidentally pasted the wrong episode titles for this DVD Box Set. Here are the correct titles:

Connections 3 DVD Disc No. 1

Feedback

In the twenty-first century, electronic agents will be our servants on the great web of knowledge. They will use the kind of feedback that won World War II. Feedback mathematics is invented to help guns hit their targets. The concept of feedback originated in the vineyards of France by a wine-maker and physiologist named Claude Bernard. His ex-wife began the Humane Society, created to save people from drowning. Drownings increased due to an increase in shipping. All of this eventually leads to the hiring of a doctor at a sanitarium in Michigan. The doctor tries out new diets on the patients. The most successful product is named after him -- Kellogg's cornflakes.

What's in a Name

A good breakfast leads to corn cob garbage by the ton. This is used for ""furfan,"" and a whole new discipline no one's heard about, called furfan chemistry. Furfan can do amazing things, like creating resin for bonding. This leads to the creation of the tractor and, then the creation of the diesel engine. Believe it or not, James Burke shows how this all leads to the creation of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.

Connections 3 DVD Disc No. 2

Drop the Apple

Smithson, the benefactor of the Smithsonian Institution, discovered the mineral calamine. This mineral is one of the most useful and unusual because it gives off electricity. The secret is in the shape. This was discovered by J. Currie of the famous pair. The first consumer use of this electricity was 33 rpm records. This eventually leads to Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which leads to the creation of the atomic bomb.

An Invisible Object

This program travels five hundred years into the past and back, to connect mysterious black holes in space with modern fast food, via thrills and spills on the Pony Express, Italian anatomy theaters and stolen corpses, the Sultan of Turkey's disastrous finances, Renaissance German jewelry, the invention of the screw, slide rules and American tobacco plantations, boiled potatoes, Spanish Inquisition thumbscrews, and why beer is served chilled. The show also includes a French Queen's dinner party, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, the greatest disaster in history (for wine-drinkers), squeaky-clean Swiss airplanes, and a fifteenth century French barber-shop quartet.

Connections 3 DVD Disc No. 3

Life is No Picnic

The advent of modern coffee-vending machines spurs the creation of freeze dried coffee. This begins a revolutionary effort by the U.S. Army in World War II to lighten the soldiers' rations packs. The Star Spangled Banner lyrics are adapted from an ancient Greek poem. Mme de Stael of Switzerland drives the Romantic Movement forward in Europe. The Romantic Movement affects all thinkers which leads to future studies of animal development. Based on this research, Darwin proposes his Theory of Evolution.

Elementary Stuff

Darwin's Theory of Evolution is shared by Alfred Russel Wallace who has a strong belief in miracles and spiritualism. British interest in spiritualism is shared by physicist Oliver Lodge who develops the coherer, the device that makes radio reception possible. With the Swiss creation of postage stamp, Switzerland becomes the world postal center. Highlanders fearing oppression from Scottish rulers flee to North Carolina where turpentine is developed. The creation of the vacuum pump is instrumental in the discovery of both Boyle's Law and Pierre Perrault's hydrography. Quarrels about whether or not present language/literature is as good as that of the past leads to the fictional character Sherlock Holmes.

Connections 3 DVD Disc No. 4

A Special Place

Meet a real live man who changed history with a totally new way of identifying you. Plus a four hundred-year trip through 20 locations. Swedish electricity and Dutch wind tunnels use a new type of photography. Aristocratic World War I fighter aces and their crazy mountain-climbing uncles. Touchy-feely times in Romantic Germany. The mysteries of ancient cities uncovered. Female painters in eighteenth-century London theaters lit by amazing new kinds of lights. Saving sailors from shipwreck and helping Caribbean smugglers. Astronomers, poets, fishermen, mathematicians and skeptics, bird-painters and Russian skullduggery lead the program to a final beauty-spot, where hundreds of Americans get drenched every day.

Fire from the Sky

How do you go from the majestic beauty of Iceland's geysers to the destruction of the Allied Firebombing of Hamburg in World War II? You stop by Stonehenge, chat with the mystical Caballists, talk to Martin Luther, Ozeander, Tycho Brahe and Mary Queen of Scots, before heading to the magnetic North Pole. The invention of gin and tonic will set you back on course to the discovery that mixing rubber with gasoline makes it burn slower, an integral component of any firebombing. It's all a matter of connections.

Connections 3 DVD Disc No. 5

Hit the Water

If you launch your story in the cockpit of a Tornado Fighter Bomber-- the height of ""smart bombs"" operated by smart pilots -- dip into the history of margarine and plankton, travel to 18th Century Turkey to investigate small pox inoculations, dance at the ballet Copelia, then blow up a dam in Norway with a British commando team, how do you prevent Hitler from building and exploding atomic bombs? Through the infinite world of unexpected connections - an ingenious look at why and how Hitler never harnessed heavy water and the A-Bomb.

In Touch

An American scientist ponders the problem of nuclear fusion in 1951. This unleashes a series of connections that encompass superconductors, the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty, King George III, modern oceanography, the Versailles Gardens, Pagoda Mania, and handwriting analysis to arrive at the Global Net. Through this chain of unexpected connections, you, too, can ""stay in touch.""",1135987200,35,6030,5.210961737331955
1925473,5,B0000DIZSJ,"Firstly, this is NOT Connections Vol. 3, it is CONNECTIONS 3 as in Connections Series 3. By saying it is ""Vol. 3"", people are likely to think it's merely one disc or volume in a series.

There were three series by James Burke in this vein. Connections (10 50 min. episodes), Connections 2 (20 30 min. episodes), and Connections 3 (10 45 min. episodes). Also, there was ""The Day the Universe Changed"" a series of 10 50 min. episodes.

This is actually a five-disc box set with the entire Connections 3 series. The episodes are as follows:

Having cleared that up, I wish to say that this is a great series and DVD set. Very eye-opening and educational.

It would make a great educational gift for children or a fun gift for adults. Anyone with an inquiring mind will be fascinated by James Burke's wit and intelligence, not to mention his charismatic delivery.",1135987200,36,3844,4.831029185867895
1925474,3,B0000DIZSJ,"Me too! I would buy this in an instant. And while you're at it get ""The Day the universe Changed"".",1073088000,5,98,3.95
8001198,5,B0000DIZSJ,"Humorous, clear description of the development of many of our modern devices.  Especially like the explanation of the perfume atomizer and the automobile combustion engine.",1498348800,,172,5.88
8001199,3,B0000DIZSJ,"It could have been better.  Someone on the IMDB stated that Burke can do no wrong.  I agree, but Connections 3 seems to lack the concern for the future of mankind that Burke's previous series had.  Connections 2 and Connections 3 seem to be rather light hearted examinations of threads that, again to me, don't always seem to be solid connections, unlike the cause and effect relationships described in the first Connections' series.

Burke in the original Connections seemed to have a concern for the future of society and mankind as a whole.  And where the two follow on series are still highly informative and fascinating, I didn't get a sense of importance mixed with some light heartedness.  We, Burke's students, were given a sense of import along with Burke's humor and somewhat ""American"" sense of humor with a British sensibility, to the point where we should be inspired to correct the mistakes and help society avoid the pitfalls that may come.  We weren't told about how wars and diseases started, but told how great inventions and discoveries improved on the human condition; it was not ""Don't do this because that might happen"", but ""If you see a problem, solve it, good things will happen and you might avoid disaster"".

And so it went in Connections and the Day the Universe Changed.  Still, Connections 3, for all its light heartedness and a kind of almost whimsical look at the history of science of invention, it informative, though again I'm not sure the connections are as solid as Burke establishes.  But, it is just my opinion.

As or price, I bought my set from another vendor for around $65, whereas the price gougers here are selling theirs' for hundreds of dollars.  I suggest shopping around first.

Either way, enjoy this series.",1480032000,,1758,4.82

8001202,3,B0000DIZSJ,"James Burke is a very knowledgeable historian and an excellent host. It must have been downright fun to put together the three ""Connections"" series and his other well known work, ""The Day The Universe Changed."" When I first saw Connections in the early 1980s, I was quite captivated by the production and learned a lot about not just where the various bits of technology come from but the almost serendipitous circumstances that brought many of them about. Sometimes happy accidents are more important than diligent research and sometimes the greatest advancements are made not in the laboratory or colleges but in the living rooms and back yards of average citizens.

That said, Connections 3 doesn't live up to that legacy. The big reason for this is that it's not so much ""Connections"" as it is ""Six Degrees of Separation"". You are led from one development to another not in sequence or down a chain but horizontally with, ""This man did this and while he was at it, he met another man who was key to this other development, which was then used by this noted person over there who employed this other fellow who helped garner funding for the research that his brother was doing in concert with a pupil that became rather the more famous of the two, which brought this other well known invention about that you and I see around us every day but no one ever thinks about."" I found it very hard to follow and rather less interesting as a result. The information presented is most certainly of use and some of it rather important to remember since it impacts your views on society and life in general but it just utterly fails to make a point.",1406851200,,1641,4.61986301369863

8001204,5,B0000DIZSJ,"Burke is always so great. This was a gift for my husband and he is enjoying the discs.

8001205,2,B0000DIZSJ,"The first series are the best, and you need to watch them several times to understand the underlying message, as the connections are intriguing on the surface, profound in essence. The second and the third are far less thoughtful then the first, more of an interesting after dinner talk. The connections are more or less accidental and trivial.",1392249600,,344,4.948275862068965
8001206,5,B0000DIZSJ,The amount of information conveyed is amazing. I've learned a great deal from watching this series. I'm looking forward to the next series.,1390348800,,139,5.086956521739131
