8505250,5,B006VYWLZQ,This animation has to be the best short animation I've ever seen. As an artist I've seen 100's of animations but this one stands out with it's visual and emotional qualities. I just came back fairly recently from visiting the battle fields of WWI in Europe and  it is he best portrayal of wartime hate that I've ever seen. The soundtrack greatly enhances the film. It was a high qualty  DVD production to top it all.,1355356800,,416,4.4605263157894735

It's tough to decide which is more compelling - the story of these two men, or the brutal visual style, but either way, this is a small masterpiece.",1330214400,,303,4.428571428571429
