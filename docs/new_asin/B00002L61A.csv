However, if you are a legit Costas Mandylor fan, you will LOVE this film. Costas is the best part of this film, and Audie England is a close second. A great film for any Costas Mandylor fan!",1331596800,,346,4.257575757575758

7915865,5,B00002L61A,"If it has 87 minutes of Costas Mandylor in it...who even cares if the movie sux! I certainly WON'T lose any sleep, as a matter of fact it might help me sleep! Ahem...sorry, but I AM an intransigent Mandylor fan! I haven't even seen it yet, can't wait to.  I'm buying it now....Sweet dreams are made of these...WHEW!  The man is HOT!",1189641600,2,332,4.338709677419355
7915866,1,B00002L61A,"Lots of irritating sex talk, a self absorbed bore for a ""heroine"", two friends who have clearly beamed down from the planet Zanussi!  It has two golden ""moments"" in the whole thing.  The street footie match, between the hero and the oddball friend, and the moment when the long suffering hero/boyfriend finally gets angry.
Aside from these pluses, it is lovingly shot in a kind of golden glow, which gives you the warm fuzzies (and captures Costas to perfection!).  A pity, because this could have been good with a bit more inspiration.
Strictly for very uncritical Mandylor fans only.",1005955200,5,585,4.888888888888889
7915867,2,B00002L61A,"Lots of nudity, annoying characters, far-fetched and sometimes confusing plot. Don't regret missing this one.",954288000,2,109,6.333333333333333
