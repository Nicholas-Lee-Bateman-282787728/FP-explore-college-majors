7125792,1,B00W7AGH4Y,"Ho hum.  Liked the special effects, but the plot and the story left a lot to be desired.  One other thing: the skimpy, cleavage baring, skintight get ups the girls wore in the first subs that got attacked by the megaladon were absolutely unrealistic.  No U.S. government agency in their right mind would allow their female members to dress like this!  Not trying to be prudish here, I served in the military for 20 years and I know we weren't allowed to dress like that!",1438214400,3,470,4.4941176470588236

7125794,3,B00W7AGH4Y,"A slapdash sci-fi flick that supposedly acts as a sequel to Mega Shark VS Mecha Shark.  In this offering, the plot flits from place to place, adding and removing characters at an alarming rate.  Only a few make it all the way through to provide some continuity.  Otherwise, it's a poorly thought out story involving a mythical fuel source, a BIG doomsday device (Kolossus), and a really BIG shark.  There's dueling doctors with conflicting ideas on how to contain/destroy poor misunderstood Mega Shark (Jeff Hatch as Dr. John Bullock and Illeana Douglas as Dr. Alison Gray).  Naturally, the navy goes with option B: seek and destroy.  Easier bragged then done.  Caught between these factions are a dweeb and an agent of some sort.  They join the `friendly' team seeking to spare Mega Shark and neutralize Kolossus.  Things do not go according to plan.  It should be noted that they spend more time dealing with the shark than they do the metal monster.  There are times I forgot Kolossus was even a part of this movie.

This is as goofy as all the other sci-fi flicks put out by Asylum.  Everything depends on your willingness to accept subpar work.  They churn out these movies like hotdogs.  They all seem overly familiar.",1437264000,2,1224,4.761904761904762

I---not being critical in ANY manner---was surprised to see how he has aged. I was even MORE surprised to find out that he's older than me (66). THAT said, he looks just
fine for someone born in 1949!
I was concerned that a Navy Admiral would wear the dark sunglasses that Ernest wore in this movie... until he turned slightly, so I could see that his right eye was dis-
figured from Amblyopia [""dead eye""]. I, now, have more respect for Mister Thomas, and applaud him for continuing an acting career under less than ideal circumstances.
Speaking of ""less than ideal circumstances"" I love these schlocky movies from THE ASYLUM studios!
I've got all four of the Mega Shark franchise movies. Love 'em all. But, you must remember that they ARE B-movies!",1437177600,10,1352,6.434065934065934

7125797,5,B00W7AGH4Y,"The biggest, best Mega Shark movie yet pits our prehistoric protagonist against a Cold War era Soviet super-robot in a clash of titans only The Asylum could pull off. Everyone in the cast is having an absolute blast, playing their roles with just the right mixture of deadly earnestness and tongue-in-cheek abandon to endear them to the audience. The good guys are affable and genuine, the bad guys gleefully malevolent and over-the-top. Kolossus and the titular Megalodon are remarkably well-rendered for such low-budget CG creatures, and both manage a degree of personality and individuality usually not possible in movie monsters not created with costumes or motion capture technology. Though the fight scenes are quite brief (a budget-driven shortcoming of all the Mega Shark movies), the pace is fast and furious, and there is plenty of spectacle and large-scale carnage for the less discriminating giant monster movie aficionado.",1436227200,10,935,5.36734693877551

7125815,3,B00W7AGH4Y,"Not as good as the previous one, but it does take the story in a new direction.  If you liked the other ones this is a must see.  If you haven't seen any of the Mega Shark movies, don't start with this one.",1466121600,3,206,3.7674418604651163
7125816,3,B00W7AGH4Y,"The 'Mega Shark' franchise is another Asylum mainstay that improved from the terminally horrible 'Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopus' to the rather good 'Mega Shark Vs Mecha Shark'. But they dropped the ball with this latest instalment and the story is a bit of a mess. The problem is there are two stories in play - the Mega Shark story and the Kolossus story. There is far too much time building individual stories and it's only the last 20 minutes of the film when Mega Shark and Kolossus meet that the fun begins.

Another issue is the way the film is constructed - for a lot of the time you get 2 - 3 second snippets of action and there is a constant cutting from one angle or particular person to another. It becomes rather disconcerting and annoying after a while.

Having said that, the special effects are the usual Asylum 'cheap' but there are lots of them. And Kolossus certainly comes off best and does look really quite good at times.

The disk has a pretty good Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack which has great use of the surround channels.

If you like cheap monster films it's probably worth giving this one a look but don't expect it to be the best of the bunch. Oh, and you need to stick around right to the end to see a bonus scene.",1465516800,,1240,4.354978354978355

7125819,3,B00W7AGH4Y,"I gave it 3 stars because it was a *cough* decent (??) *cough* storyline wrapped by bad acting, bad editing, bad special effects (actually some wasn't too terribly bad) and some instances of shaky camera work.  But I already knew that going in.
Their budget was probably about as much as a new Yugo would cost, new, in 1985 but hey....they worked with it.
If you watch this movie, you'd better go in knowing all these factors else you will be very upset and feel your time wasted.  I knew that going in so I wasn't disappointed.
On the plus side (I guess), the movie' pace was steady & kept you interested despite all the bad points mentioned above.  I've paid movie ticket prices for worse movies than this!
Also, about 15 minutes in is when I started noticing the bad things which kept me till the end.  So if you do watch it, watch it just for that.  Make it a game.",1464480000,2,869,4.306748466257669

7125828,4,B00W7AGH4Y,"This is one of the best in the Mega Shark Series. Mega shark is quickly introduced and sets his sights on taking out a fleet of submarines. Kolossus is the thing that got my attention and held my interest thru this movie. He is introduced during a swap deal gone wrong and he is not in a good mood. He is enormous looking and with the magic of movie making they made him look really cool and dangerous. To give you a idea of his size he doesn't need to go thru a door, he just breaks up out of a roof! Acting was not bad either but have to say that the Mega Shark And Kolossus took off with this one. Agree that there should have been more action between the two of them , after all, that is what the title implies.",1461024000,,715,3.9722222222222223

Biggest asset:  wall-to-wall action.  There is enough happening here to fill 3 films.  The actors play very seriously against a backdrop of quite frankly goofy happenings, which lends the film enough gravitas to make things believable enough to involve viewers in the plot.  The special effects are up to Playstation 4 game quality.  And some of the concepts are just off-the-rails nutso in the best possible way.
