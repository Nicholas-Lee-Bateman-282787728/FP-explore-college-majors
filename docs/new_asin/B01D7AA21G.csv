7704239,5,B01D7AA21G,"Can't go wrong with it if you liked The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Summer Wars, and Wolf Children. Even though it's another coming-of-age story by Mamoru Hosoda, it still feels like it's own story. I've already seen it and I loved it, but I'll still buy it to add it to my collection.",1459296000,8,286,4.314814814814815
7704240,5,B01D7AA21G,I loved this movie.  A powerful story about a kid with nothing left to live for stumbles in the land of animals.  Great art style and funny dialogue keeps this story fresh.  I can't wait to pick this up on dvd.,1459036800,,210,4.073170731707317

7704242,5,B01D7AA21G,"I saw this movie subtitled in the theater and I thought when it was over, ""What a privilege to have seen this.""  I am not a male, but its message is universal: have a goal and work toward it; people can change; people in relationships do change; there is darkness in each of our hearts and what you decide to do with that darkness determines everything.  Only through self-discipline and a recognition of who you are will you ever fulfill your destiny.  I also saw it on the computer and I just pre-ordered it on Amazon.  For those who are fathers (or sons) and don't know what kind of relationship they should have or have had with the other, this movie will be an eye-opener.",1458518400,23,677,4.392

That aside and back to the movie: a great message and an awesome relationship between the apprentice and his master. It speaks to so many levels of struggle that we all face, and I really loved Hosoda's take on it in this film.",1516838400,,577,4.151785714285714

7704278,5,B01D7AA21G,Japanese version is 10x better than English. The voice acting is superb and you get sucked into loving the characters/story from the very beginning. Music is great too.,1515024000,,168,5.035714285714286

7704284,3,B01D7AA21G,"It's insanely well animated and very creative, but poorly written. The dub was dreadful so that may have been part of my frustration. I kept shouting ""SHOW. DON'T TELL."" at all the unnecessary exposition. The little white poof mascot I adored (even though it was admittedly pretty pointless), the monkey, pig friend, rabbit lord, and the boar I liked too. I liked everyone except our main characters, who were stubborn, tropey, and brooding even after they had supposedly learned their lessons. The Beast character, when he was down in the big battle near the end, he very clearly was down for over the 10 second mark. More like 30. I know that time supposedly slows down in these moments but it sure took forever and everyone was still moving in real time, so he should have lost the match. The villian kid we didn't spend nearly enough time with to establish his hatred for humans (he went from chill to jerk so suddenly, it was very out of character). The ""darkness"" is incredibly vague in its logic depending on the character its being used by (it's pure evil, but also... good? If you use it to kick someone's butt?). The Moby Dick thing, I think they were trying to force meaning into a story that didn't know where it was going or what it was trying to say. The lead matured a bit in the middle of the story, but reverted and got so unnecessarily angsty near the end, it came off as melodramatic and silly. He even killed the villian kid in the end, which is his first murder, even in self defense. He didn't even feel bad for the villian. The Deus Ex Machina at the end was a power fantasy with nothing to say other than ""you too can achieve The Ridiculous by being angry and having a girlfriend and a 'charming' sensei who encapsulates all the dumb 'craaazy sensei' tropes"" which has zero practical use in real life. It's good to protect those you love, but in the end, he didn't face his anger. A yelling from a friend isn't going to just solve that so suddenly. The final battle didn't address the change of heart in our main character, not when it came to anger or stubbornness. None of this is even accurate to the Moral of the Story in Moby Dick. Not even close!
He did not face any of his inner demons in the end. He just stopped himself from killing the villian kid... at first. Only to kill him in the next scene anyway, but it's okay though because there was glitter this time and an orchestra. I really wanted to like this film, and there's a lot I do like visually, but the bad stuff was pretty frustrating. Also was pretty ridiculous with the furry-bara aspects. It was clear they were really trying to sell the Beast as a ""hot badboy"" and it was terribly annoying. Really? The dumb dramatic hair floof? Moustache stubble on an already HAIRY face? Whyyyy? If you want a fun manly punch-out scene, look no further than Castle in the Sky where a buff miner and a grunt have a funny and manly brawl that gets out of hand. The shirts even explode! But it was lighthearted and knowingly ridiculous. Didn't take itself so seriously. Or if they were taking themselves seriously, there's no need for the shirtless silliness and melodrama, just needed good raw action and some purposeful (not melodramatic) acting or dialogue that keeps the story moving. I dunno, maybe I just don't get this movie.",1512864000,,3310,4.5

7704302,5,B01D7AA21G,"Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.
A lot of reviewers already talked about the art and characters, but I think a lot of them were viewing the movie on a superficial level. On a superficial level, this is a hilarious, touching, beautiful movie. And superficial viewing is perfectly enjoyable. But if you stop and ask yourself ""what is this movie trying to tell me?"" then the movie achieves BRILLIANCE.

So many positive things can be taken from this movie, the main one being how every relationship between two people can have a positive impact on both ends. For example, a son can learn from a father, and a father can learn from a son. The love/friendship that each party learns to feel, can yield even MORE positive effects for the two of them.
There are MANY other themes too, but I'm not gonna spoil them by preaching about them. 'Cause the movie doesn't preach, either. The themes are integrated into the story in such a way that they are naturally expressed.",1500336000,,962,4.726190476190476

Please note however, if you rent this movie from Amazon, you only have the English dub option.  You can't switch the language/audio to Japanese, which I found a bit of a disappointment.  Here is the description from the product page, but again, if you rent this movie, it's in English only:

Language: Japanese, English
Subtitles: English
Dubbed: English

I always prefer the original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles because the English dub can be hit or miss (and it's usually miss..)

7704379,4,B01D7AA21G,"What a great film.  I had been wanting to see it since it's initial foreign release.  I was not disappointed.  The characters were extremely human and the story was quite touching.  Not amazing animation, this is no studio Ghibli, the beasts were a bit cartoonish, but not enough to be distracting.  The mix of excellent perspectives (the surveillance cameras, the use of color) is for the most part well played contrast.  The story was different enough to not be boring or too reductive, even though it contained the typical ""yelling through conflict"" element that I often find to be over the top in some action anime.  All in all a nice way to spend a few hours of your time.",1484092800,,677,4.591666666666667

7704381,2,B01D7AA21G,"I own both Summer Wars, and Wolf Children, which I thought were two of the best anime movies I've seen. Both have great characters, interesting plots, and great music.

I jumped at the chance to own this. To begin with, the quality of the dvd image was great. The music was clear, and the voices great. I haven't used the Blu Ray copy, and I likely won't.

The movie was a bore in my opinion. I always have a hard time with movies where I don't really like the characters. I just had a difficult time finding something to like about either one. In fact, the two side kicks (the monkey and the pig dude), were far more interesting. And they were rather flat characters.

The Beast kinda redeems himself at the end, and the boy gets stronger and becomes a hero of sorts. But, the arguing they have gets trite, and predictable, and annoying to listen. The plot towards the end gets a little hokey back in the human world, which was eluded to at the beginning. It took two sittings to get through, and I regret to say I won't be going back to it like his other two movies.

Oh well. It was a chore to watch for me. But, for most, I'm sure you'll like it.",1483920000,,1150,4.213636363636364

7704414,5,B01D7AA21G,"Just finished watching ""The Boy and the Beast"" released by Funimation.
Animation director Mamoru Hosoda is certainly giving Studio Ghibli a run for it's money.  With ""The Boy and the Beast,"" Hosoda provides an exploration of the heart and what it means to be a father and son amidst lush animation and compelling story telling.
When nine-year-old Wren runs away from home rather then being forced to live with relatives who hate him, after his mother dies, he stumbles upon a maze of alleyways one evening while on the run from the police for violating curfew and enters a world where intelligent bipedal beats of all kind rule and humans are forbidden to enter because of the darkness within them.
Wren is taken in by Kumatetsu, who renames him Kyuta.  Kumatestu wants to become the next ruler of the city, but needs to prove his worth by training an apprentice.  He takes on Kyuta and despite an initial falling out and bickering, master and apprentice form a father and son bond that is tested when nine years later when Kyuta finds a path back to the human world he long abandoned and finds love with a young school girl and has a chance to reunite with the human father who had never stopped looking for him.
Yet, there is a darkness festering in the world Kyuta has called home for nine years; and it is a darkness that will destroy all that he holds dear unless he can defeat the own darkness within him.
A grand epic tale of love and a father's sacrifice for his son.
Highly Recommended!

While I do not think this is his best work (that will always be wolf children in my opinion) I still loved this movie. The relationship between Kuta and Komutestu is a really good and believable one.
The comedy is right on with this movie, being very subtle and quite instead of in your face all the time and trying to force you to laugh.
My only issues with the movie is that it really did not need a villain or a love interest. both of them felt kind of forced and I would have been more then happy to just see the two main characters relationship instead of the others.

The sad truth is that well over 90% of anime is sheer re--hashed garbage with the same personalities drawn in the same likeness exploring the same tropes over and over and over and over ad nauseam. And unfortunately, Boy and the Beast fallls way hard into the 99th percentile rather than that exceptional 1% or even top 5-10% range. There's nothing here that hasn't been explored before. The animation is average. The characters are average. There's nothing especially endearing about anyone.

Background character design for ""beasts"" reminiscent of second-year furry art, main ""beast"" character design reminiscent of first-year furry art. (With a whole culture dedicated to distilling what we in the animation business aptly call ""appeal in drawing"" why he studio couldn't have hired some high-end Anthro artists to design their ""beast world"" character model sheets, I just don't know.)  The environments are beautifully painted, and the 3D elements blended wonderfully with the 2D elements.

It is well worth watching, but know going in that the anthropomorphic designs are not stellar, and that the story's brief, voice-over dnouement weakens the film's climax.",1471219200,,813,5.710743801652892

7704504,5,B01D7AA21G,"I bought this movie based on a recommendation from a librarian.  I love this movie.

A boy whose mother dies when he is 9 has somewhat cruel family members who will have to look after him.  He runs away.  While on the street, he follows some odd fellows and discovers that they are really beasts/animals that actually walk on hind legs and talk.  He ends up bonding with one kind of rough guy and the beast ends up training him on how to fight and become his apprentice.  He realizes that he can move between their world and ours and starts to grow and discover more about himself and the two worlds.

Very detailed ending.  You need to pay attention to some of the details during the movie or the end might not make much sense.  It is based on a lot of traditional values within Japanese culture.",1470873600,11,797,4.331081081081081
7704505,5,B01D7AA21G,"The Boy and the Beast is the story of an orphan boy named Ren who stumbles into 'Jutengai', the mystical world inhabited by beasts. He soon undergoes training from Kumatestu, a surly and sloppy but strong beast warrior who is in competition with another warrior, Ioza, for the title of lord following the retiring of the current lord. Despite getting off to a rough start, over the next few years Ren (renamed Kyuta by Kumatestu) trains under Kumatestu and both form a unique bond as they learn how to conquer each other's negative qualities and learn about true strength and love.

This movie was stunning visual feast. It reminded me of Studio Ghibli's works in the sense that this movie is reminiscent of some of Ghibli's finest like Spirited Away and The Cat Returns. The sense of magical realism is in play as Ren crosses between the world of beasts and Shibuya in Tokyo, Japan. This movie, like some of Studio Ghibli's output, has a lot of heart and you will love the characters. The story is well told, as Ren goes through the struggle to overcome the darkness and hate he experienced as a boy and with the help of the beasts and people in his life, he is able to emerge victorious. As the film states, we are all capable of feeling darkness, and the fact that you can overcome the darkness and come out better because of the hardships life throws at you shows that there is always hope, and where we find strength. This was a fantastic movie, and one you should recommend to friends and family!!",1470787200,,1503,4.546125461254612

This was not one. Don't get me wrong, the artwork was beautiful. The characters were fun, abit thin though, lacking development. Beyond that, there wasn't much else to appreciate. I watched it in theaters with a friend and we both agreed the storyline was all over the place and left the audience with too many loose ends (what was the point of him finding his dad only to leave him again? Then what happened to his dad?). The English dub was bad, but that made sense when you listen to the script/writing. After listening to the script, I felt like I was listening to 1500s Shakespearean play written by a robot. Who talks like that? The movie was trying to do so much at once and fell very short. Action scenes were short-lived as well. If you're friend buys this on blu-ray and invites you over to watch this, and if you don't already have plans, then go head, watch it.

The animation and story telling technique reminded me of ""Princess Mononoke"". Without revealing too much the story simply put, is the story of a boys coming of age and copping with abandonment and loss. It is also the tale of his mentor growing more into a leader. The action and dialog were mostly balanced, there could have been a little bit more fight scenes, but what they didn't hit on with that they more than made up for with the dialog and emotions (albeit this was mainly between the main character/mentor).

Thematically it's a worthwhile effort, but it simply didn't have the power of the other two works, which are simply two of the eight or ten best anime I've ever seen. The Boy and the Beast does a good but not astounding job of dramatizing (with a lot of fun thrown in) a boy's reconnecting with the human world--and with his father--with the help of a big hairy beast with a paternal instinct.",1469664000,,656,4.615384615384615

7704544,3,B01D7AA21G,"Let me start by saying I adore animation. I seldom watch live-action in favor of films by Disney or Miyazaki. As such,  I'm quite familiar with Mamoru Hosoda's works (Wolf Children, Summer Wars, The Girl who Leapt Through Time) and had extremely high expectations for The boy and the Beast. The trailer looked phenomenal, and in some sense, it delivered on that front: the animation was absolutely gorgeous! Shibuya was so realistically detailed, and the environments felt so lush. But my positive accolades end there.

It's unfortunate for me to admit that I liked this film the least out of Hosoda's filmography. Oddly enough, it's the same criticisms that the 1-star and 2-star reviews have left for this film, though hopefully less crude. To start, it lacked the concise editing that his former films possessed. It started on the right foot, and I was hoping the film would really delve into role-models and father figures, which is really what this film is about. But this whole process was rushed through a 8-year montage (albeit, a very lovely one), and the film slowly took on the thematics of a cheesy anime: personal darkness, identity crises, etc. It's not to say that these themes aren't of merit, but I think they need to fleshed out in novel ways, rather than tacked on to the end of a film like this one. There's no backstory for Kumatetsu or his motives for wanting to be the grandmaster. As a result, it leaves one of our main protagonists a flat character, only acting as an accessory to Kyuuta's storyline rather than standing on his own.

This leads me to my second criticism: It was a bit all over the place, attempting to tackle too many topics in it's excessively lengthy 120 minute film. And in the second half of the film, took on too many anime cliche's for the film to even be enjoyable. The main antagonist, Ichirohiko, makes an appearance in the beginning, and then all of a sudden becomes this force of evil in the latter half of the film, threatening Shibuya. It was just like, ""Where's this coming from?"" And yes, I understand his problems are thoroughly explained, but it wasn't properly built up throughout the span of the film in a natural way. Ichirohiko himself is awkward for me to watch, characterized only by cringe-worthy maniacal laughter.

And finally, I felt Kaede's (Kyuuta's love interest) character was completely unnecessary. She went on and on about her own identity crisis when it wasn't really asked of her. She reminded me of an acquaintance you had just met, unloading all of her personal problems on you when your relationship doesn't warrant it:  It just puts you in an uncomfortable position. At the film's climax, she pulls an ultimate anime cliche uttering a completely Naruto-esque spiel about how everyone has darkness in their hearts and that you're never alone.

I apologize for this lengthy review, and hope that it is (on some level) coherent. I suppose I just had too high of hopes for Hosoda to fill. I completely agree with other critical reviews in that the film wastes its glorious animation on a mish-mash of anime archetypes that becomes almost unbearable to watch near the end. I anticipate Hosoda's next films and hopes he returns to a more intimate style of story telling as seen in my personal favorite, Wolf Children.",1469059200,6,3293,4.788732394366197

7704562,4,B01D7AA21G,"A great addition to the growing catalog of Mamoru Hosoda's films. I cannot recommend this film enough to those who have enjoyed his previous works.

This fantastical tale about a chance relationship between a problem young boy and a rough bear is endearing and heartfelt.

Despite my general apathy towards disney films, I feel that the writing and the way all of the characters interact with one another is very comparable; the story and dialogue is equal parts serious, dramatic and weird, with cute comedic points spread liberally throughout.

How kyuta and kumatetsu work together (or dont) are some of the best moments in the film and continued to further my interest in their story. They both bring to the table something that the other was desperately in need of,even if neither of them like to admit it.

The quality of the animation is exactly what I expect from a Mamoru Hosoda film, with crisp clean animation that transitions smoothly from one moment to the next (exceptions for moments when it was artistically changed), backgrounds are eye-catching and full of fun and unique views and vistas.

In short, this is a must-see for fans of Hosoda's previous work; also a great introduction to his works for those who are looking to fill the hole that Ghibli's recent releases have been leaving (and the passing of icon Satoshi Kon).",1468540800,4,1342,4.868421052631579

7704570,4,B01D7AA21G,"Of Mamora Hosoda's films, this is the most relatable in the sense of it being a tale of growing up. Our main character, ""The Boy"" decides to flee from a situation that his young self cannot come to terms with, and he meets ""The Beast"", who is rash, rude, and needs a disciple. The boy wants to become stronger, and he too is rash and doesn't do well well having a teacher who cannot teach, but nonetheless, the Boy and Beast find common ground in which they learn, grow, and find that they are the strongest when together.

This is an inspiring film of growing up, finding family, and learning to forgive and move forward. A breath of fresh air that shows that Hosoda is a master at his craft, and that his story-telling is evolving, but forever captivating.

It was great watching the two characters grow and learn from each other and for a movie that had to do with beast and martial arts it had some themes that fell surprisingly normal. All the supporting cast where well rounded and interesting. I especially liked how that one kid would bully Ren but they eventually became friends. It shows that relationships can change over time. Which is something I can really relate too. I liked the monkey and the pig monk guy! I though the went really well together and supported the main characters. The character designs where really done well. I like the simplistic style of their clothing and the beast looked really cool. The fight scenes weren't have bad either.

Nor is it a scholarly treatise on the meaning of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moby-Dick/dp/B00LLOAQK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moby Dick</a>, though said meaning does get discussed here.  Rather it is a film about the absolute need of sons for their fathers, whether said fathers are natural, adoptive, or surrogate (to a lesser extent it is also about the need of fathers for their sons), and in a world that increasingly treats fathers as unnecessary, even expendable, that is a powerful and long overdue message.

After the tragic death of his divorced mother, 9-year-old Ren is TOLD that he will now live with her family; his request to live with a father he barely remembers is not only ignored, it is ridiculed.  (We later learn that her family never even bothered to notify his father of his ex-wife's death until long after Ren had run away from home.)  Later, while dodging the police, things get weird; Ren is grabbed by the Beast Man, Kumatetsu, who on a whim, offers to make Ren his apprentice and tells him to follow him if he agrees.  More than a little unsure, but liking the idea better than waiting for the police to catch him and send him back to live with his relatives, Ren stumbles through the maze like entrance to a parallel world: Jutengai, the Beast Kingdom, inhabited by sentient, humanoid beasts.

Ren, renamed Kyuta, and Kumatetsu initially get along about as well as you'd expect a couple of stubborn loners like them to, in part because Kumatetsu, having grown up fatherless, is largely self-taught and thus doesn't know how to teach.  But Ren is inspired to try imitating Kumatetsu, which works remarkably well, and eight years of training pass before Ren accidentally wanders back into the human world where he rescues a bookish girl student from bullies, and she offers to teach him to read better and prepare for going to college.  In the process Ren also tracks down his real father and learns he had been looking for him all this time.  Torn between the tug of two worlds, Ren finds himself rejecting both, but events are building to a climax, and a dark threat is arising in his own heart and that of another.

Some critics have dismissed this film as one of director Mamoru Hosoda's lesser works because of all the reused cliches, but IMHO they are missing his point because he is using said cliches to teach a different message as noted above.  Mothers can do wonders, bur as John Eldridge teaches in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wild-at-Heart/dp/1400200393/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wild at Heart</a>, only a man can model and validate masculinity for a boy, and if a boy never learns it (or learns it from the wrong man or men), the results can be very damaging.  It is no accident that the villain of the piece turns out to be a son gone astray due to the unintended neglect of a loving father.

7704649,5,B01D7AA21G,"The Director Mamora Hosoda has 2 things in each of his movies so far.
1) a strong family drama perspective: a teenaged girl trying to get a boyfriend, the dynamic of a family reunion, the struggles of a angle mother, and in this case, a boy and his idemtity via his father figures.
2) whatever is the nerdiest thing he can think of at the time.

Because of those two things his films are exciting and heart felt, but you need to understand that split so you do not get lost in ""Wait, how does that super computer with the demon in it work?"". Nevermind, just focus on the family stuff.

This movie has a whale of a distraction that could take you out of the story of a boy and his pain. But the dubbed version of it (in addition to the great voice acting funimation provides) makes that transition of fantastic elements easier. If you are a hardcore anime fan you know how to roll with it anyway, but like Hayao Miyazaki or Satoshi Kon, Mamora Hosada is a very good anime director that more people need to see outside of the geek circle closest to it. I hope the direct learns how to trim a bit of the fat next time.

7704664,5,B01D7AA21G,"Japanese anime seems dominated by overstylized action flicks populated by squeaky-voiced kids whose ability to rain down death and destruction belies their babyish features.

Not so the work of Mamoru Hosoda. Best known in America for Summer Wars (2009) and Wolf Children (2012), Hosoda crafts sublimely beautiful coming-of-age stories. The kids in his movies may start out petulant, irresponsible, and selfish, but invariably they grow up.

The Boy and the Beast, the director's latest coming-of-age story, is a brilliant, funny morality tale that examines the transformative effects of martial-arts training.

It tells the life story of Ren, a 9-year-old runaway so deeply wounded by the death of his mother that he has decided to hate humanity.

One day, he finds himself in an alleyway that leads to a city populated by strange, anthropomorphic ""beasts,"" as the English subtitles put it. (The Japanese word, bakemono, translates as ""monster"" or ""goblin."")

Hosoda upends the usual take on humans and monsters, making the beasts the more refined, moral beings. They revile humans as savage creatures.

""Humans are weaker,"" one beast tells the human child, ""and harbor darkness in their souls.""

Ren finds himself in the middle of a rivalry between two martial-arts masters vying to become the next lord of the city. Iozen, the favorite, is a refined, skilled swordsman and beloved hero who has dozens of disciples.

Ren is drawn to the underdog Kumatetsu, an immature hothead who dominates opponents by brute force. An orphan who taught himself to fight, this master has no time for anyone else - and no followers. The current lord, a wily, rabbitlike guru, demands that Kumatetsu show he can train a single apprentice before he can fight Iozen for the title.

And so begins a long, rocky relationship between boy and warrior, full of comic banter. Equally stubborn, equally wounded by a hard life, and both full of rage, they butt heads again and again.

The Boy and the Beast follows Ren's progress for nearly a decade, eventually taking him back to the human world and back again to the world of the beasts as he battles the rage within.

Even with a running time of 119 minutes, The Boy and the World tries to do far too much. Its narrative range, rich themes, and moral depth would have been better broken into two or more films.

Still, it's a fitting addition to Hosoda's remarkable body of work.",1464912000,,2406,4.95771144278607

7704668,5,B01D7AA21G,"*BEWARE OF THE LONG IN-DEPTH REVIEW AND MINOR SPOILERS*

This Movie has to be one of my top favorite movies that Hosoda has ever created. Of course, Wolf Children and Summer Wars were just as good. (I highly recommend watching these movies as well). If you like Spirited Away and Summer Wars, then you'll like this movie. The main reason why I liked this movie was because of the precious bond between father and son that was numerously depicted in this film. But here's my complete review of the movie:

-Family: Mamoru Hosoda is known for depicting the ""love for family"" theme in all of his movies. He does this once again by portraying this love through the two main characters, Kumatetsu and Ren (Kyuuta). I loved the concept of a ill-tempered beast adopting a lonely boy. (This is a good movie to watch with the whole family- especially on Father's Day)

Coming of Age: if you like seeing main characters grow up and mature in front of your very eyes then you'll definitely like this movie. Mamoru did a very good job showing the audience how mature Ren (Kyuuta) got just by seeing the way he acts and talks in front of other people around him.

Action!: Man, I absolutely loved the action in this movie. In Summer Wars, I said to myself, ""If only Mamoru made a film with just action in it..."" The Boy and the Beast did me great justice. The animation in this film is extremely fluid and seamless. You'll be amazed when you actually watch it on the big screen. Also, there is some minor blood shown in this movie but I personally think it's safe for the kids.

Profanity: Good news, there is no profanity (not that I remember). So this movie is absolutely safe to watch with kids. Also, the humor in this movie made me laugh out loud at some points (couldn't help it).

-Ending: *MINOR SPOILERS*
So, the ending of this movie bewildered me, not gonna lie. I liked/disliked the ending. There are certain aspects of the ending where I asked myself, ""How did he get there?"" Or ""Why did he do that?"" I soon realized however that what's most important is the meaning behind these actions. I personally found the ending to be very bittersweet (so did my friends who were watching the movie with me). As soon as the movie was over, they announced that they liked Summer Wars better. (I did agree to this statement.) But still, a great film with amazing animation and a great message.

You can judge the movie for yourselves but I personally liked this film. My only advice however is to watch this movie and watch Summer Wars right after. You might like Summer Wars better- but hey, its your own opinion (which is totally fine).

Again, sorry for the long review but I hope you enjoy the movie (you can probably find it online which is what I did and it was in HD).

Have a nice day!",1461628800,32,2780,4.4674556213017755

7704671,5,B01D7AA21G,"I went to see this when it was in Theaters in Denver, and like all of Mamoru Hosoda films it struck me at the core.  This film like his others follow a emotional journey rather then a actual physical one.  though it does have moments of Journey to the West the tale from China of the Monkey King. it's more of a tale of a orphaned boy, angry that his mother was taken from him, and being in Japan a country were divorces are more absolute then in the west, he is left alone on the streets.  (Partially his own choosing but at a young age like that it's arguable.) Then a wandering bear spirit completely unable to find a pupal one of the things needed to transcend into the next level as a spirit jokingly takes the boy under his wing.  From there a bond is formed between the boy and the Bear as the movie in ways pokes at the legend of the Monkey King, though it really follows the classic Kung Fu films of a angry boy learning marshal arts to grow into a functional adult from the non functional adult.

Visually this film is up there with some of the best animation in the industry, followed by a style that definitely Anime but not entirely tied to big eyes and pink hair.  The girl is actually mostly real human looking, with a voice that's not high pitch and painful to listen to.

My only qualm about the film and this is more of a critic then and actual problem considering the main subject matter, but the girl seems quite fine with the main boy being near abusive in parts.  now is this reflecting 'the Beauty and the Beast' complex or is this more of her not being developed enough to have a personality to say 'no, you crazy.' But still him developing into a not crazy person and their love for each other makes for one powerful ending and so it goes.

The films ability to tap into the core emotions tied to parents, bonding and anger is one of it's true strengths.  Leaving me, and my friend two soppy idiots in tears for most of the end.  I'd recommend this film to people that aren't 'Anime' fans easily.",1459814400,11,2021,4.250652741514361

If I was a collector this would make me mad, but Im more interested in just the movie and wasn't worth returning it and waiting to watch it even longer so I just kept the torn box.

Over all opinion awesome movie bad shipping and handling.",1534291200,,368,4.183098591549296

The animation style is very eye catching and there is in depth character development. In fact, the whole movie is surrounds character development. It is a good movie to just go into not knowing anything about it except that is was highly praised. I am not one for watching movies more than once, at least for extended periods of time. This is one that I would watch again shortly after.",1534291200,,482,4.682352941176471
