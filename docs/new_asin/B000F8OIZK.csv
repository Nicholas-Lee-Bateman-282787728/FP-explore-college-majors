8119032,5,B000F8OIZK,"This presentation covers a wide range of information about cats including:
The history of domestication
Why and how cats purr
The difference between territory and range
Why cats act the way they do
How to interact with cats
How to help cats interact with cats
The different type of cats
Development at different ages
How to deal with pets kept inside only
How cat's eyes work

The list is only a fraction of what is actually covered here. It is well presented by renowned cat expert Roger Taylor. The presentation is low-key, without a lot of background noise and snare drums. The presentation is consistent and not a bunch of little bitty sound bites with no background information.

After watching this presentation you may strive for a new relationship with your best friend.",1402704000,2,778,4.842105263157895
8119033,5,B000F8OIZK,You may never fully understand your cat ( or any cat for that matter) but you'll certainly enjoy watching this DVD with your family & your cat(s)!!,1398038400,,147,4.481481481481482
8119034,2,B000F8OIZK,"I saw this DVD with my grandparents about 4-5 years ago. I was about 10 years old or so. This almost put me right to sleep! And to add even more insult to it all, the picture quality absolutely sucked, it was like watching something filmed in the 1970's. I had to Wake my grandparents up after it over. It was just mostly the boring narriator flapping his gums for a long time. It was pretty informing though, I'll give it that.",1387756800,,428,4.2317073170731705
8119035,3,B000F8OIZK,"Although it has good information this video makes one of my very favorite subjects, cats, quite boring!  It is done in the UK and they have very different ideas about cat care compared to the US.  Some situations were set up for demonstration but could have had bad outcomes.  Hopefully the animals involved were well trained!",1374537600,2,326,4.785714285714286
8119036,5,B000F8OIZK,"Roger Tabor presents basic information about cats as hunters and as ""owners"" of their territories. He contrasts the wide ranging area of the tomcat with the much smaller area of the queen cat.  When too many cats are confined in a small space, such as in an apartment, all kinds of problems develop owing to territoriality, marking, stress, etc.

Tabor sees the cat as one who shares its territory with the human. The cat thus, in a sense, sees the human as a fellow cat in much the same way that a human sees the cat as a fellow person.

The adult cat kneads the human in much the same way that a kitten kneads its mother. The big size-difference between the adult cat and human is thought to remind the cat of its onetime size difference, as a kitten, with its mother.

It is helpful if kittens are handled by humans at an early age. In this way, the kittens come to see the humans as littermates.

One part of this DVD is a little outdated. The speaker considers the domestication of cats to have occurred in Ancient Egypt. Actually, there is archaeological evidence, going some thousands of years earlier, of humans and cats already being in a relationship, even if it was not exactly domestication. It comes in the form of a cat skeleton resting next to a human skeleton in a deliberate funeral burial.",1360972800,3,1307,4.4978902953586495
8119037,3,B000F8OIZK,"I was hoping that this was a documentary I saw on PBS back in the 1990's, but it turned out to be a monologue by a British cat expert as he walks around his country home.  He has cats all around him doing what cats do.  He explains it all for us.  Most interesting is his explanation of where purring comes from.  All in all it was an interesting seminar on cats and their behavior.  It's not as good as that documentary I'd seen, but I enjoyed it never-the-less.",1273363200,7,463,4.157303370786517
8119038,4,B000F8OIZK,"The was a good documentary on 'outside' cats.  I was unable to sit through an entire showing in one evening, but breaking it up for viewing a couple segments on different evenings worked well.  I've owned cats my entire life and was curious about my knowledge, so thought this might be worth seeing.  I'm glad that I did, and now am going to purchase the documentary for 'inside' cats.",1213315200,2,385,4.550724637681159
8119039,5,B000F8OIZK,My kids (boys ages 5 and 11) love cats and have watched this movie over and over. It has interesting information for cat owners.,1212969600,,128,4.375
