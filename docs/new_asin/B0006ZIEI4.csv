His talent is phenomenal and he has the gift of showing you just what he's teaching.  This is my second DVD of his, I have had the country piano DVD for some time and learned a lot from it too.  He assumes you have some piano knowledge and takes if from there.",1486771200,,387,4.1891891891891895

8044152,4,B0006ZIEI4,"This was an entertaining video but hard to learn the songs because it is not broken down for beginners so you have to re-wind it which can be frustrating.  Still, I would recommend it as there arnt' that many instructional videos on the market for this type of piano playing.",1211068800,6,275,4.5

8044154,5,B0006ZIEI4,"For starters, Bob Hoban is a jovial guy with awesome chops, so this DVD is a pleasure to watch.  It is packed with information and know-how, history of rock, suggestions for playing with a band, and recommended recordings for further study.  He shows you each lick played at full speed and then plays it very slowly so you can clearly see what he is doing, and he even names the notes he is playing to make sure you get it.  A booklet is included with some examples written out in notation (but many more are not notated, which you could do for yourself).  This is one DVD I will be using a lot, and when I saw that Bob Hoban also has done a Country Piano DVD for Homespun Tapes, I had to get that one as well.",1163548800,23,710,4.1231884057971016
