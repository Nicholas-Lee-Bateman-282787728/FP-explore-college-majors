6105805,5,B00GS1GWRU,Great anime. The artwork and story was great. I got mine at Ebay $23.96. Coco plan was good but not the best way . Rather it work or not. Only time will tell.,1418774400,,158,3.8181818181818183
6105806,5,B00GS1GWRU,Outstanding Anime.  Amazing story and great artwork.  Definitely buy this.  The only negative thing I can say is it ended.  It felt like there was more story to tell and it ended to soon.,1415232000,,187,4.411764705882353

6105809,5,B00GS1GWRU,"One of the best [newer] animes out there.

I highly recommend this along with Black Lagoon for a perfect action-packed viewing experience.

Great story, great characters, overall decent animation - five star product all the way around.

The BD is nice too for its audio. No noticeable banding or upconversion pixelation. Definitely worth it - support Koko.",1405900800,2,356,5.2105263157894735

6105811,3,B00GS1GWRU,"I loved the first 12 episodes of the show. I published a glowing review right here on Amazon. I had gargantuan expectations going into the second season. I expected guns blazing, rocket launchers and Valmet slicing her foes to ribbons in almost every episode.

Instead, I got a whole bunch of wordy expositions and recycled animation (come on, everybody already knows about how Jonah was recruited into Koko's service). Instead of competent villains that could give our heroes a run for their money (and scalps), we had a handful of worthless army rejects! Hex's cruelty and ruthlessness were showcased in the first two episodes, but the third (which concludes her arc) was lacklustre, to say the very least.

The next three episodes take us to Japan, where Jonah gets to meet the other children from his orphanage. The chase/gunfight combo is ruined by the punching-bag quality of the posse's opponents. The final arc showcases Koko's plan for world peace, but this is predictable and dull.

The worst portion of this 12-episode slug has got to be the unresolved conflict between Valmet and Karen Lo, although side characters R, Tojo and Wilee do get significant screentime. That's something to look forward to, at least.",1403136000,4,1222,5.009852216748769

6105816,5,B00GS1GWRU,Another season of Coco and the gang with things getting more intense. While I will admit I was a little surprised with the increase in nudity (I think there was one or two nude scenes in the first season compared to this season having 4-6 nude scenes) I still enjoyed this season. I loved this series and I am a little sad that its over. Farewell Coco and crew and enjoy your new world,1429920000,,385,4.216216216216216
6105817,5,B00GS1GWRU,Great show.,1427760000,,11,5.0
6105818,5,B00GS1GWRU,An expertly voice acted anime with very whimsical characters. The plot is all over the place but the series ends in a way that's open to interpretation. I'd reccomend this anime to anyone easily.,1426377600,,195,4.764705882352941

you love anime get it. It holds no punches trust me.",1425168000,,101,4.05
6105821,4,B00GS1GWRU,"Continues awesomeness from 1st season or part 1(whichever you prefer) I personally would have liked a little more info after the ending, perhaps we'll get a single OVA or so in the future. Anyway, a solid anime in my opinion. If you liked(or haven't seen)""Black Lagoon"" grab the first two seasons plus the OVA - Roberta's Blood Trail along with both seasons of Jormungand.  Your Welcome!

I don't want to spoil anything but I wish they would make a 3 third season!  There is a big following with Jormungand and I hope there will be a movie or another season!",1466899200,,382,4.338028169014085
