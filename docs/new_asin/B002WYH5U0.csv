8383414,5,B002WYH5U0,"This is the most beautiful DVD of the canyons I have ever seen - by far.  I've seen many of these places in person a long time ago and this great DVD brought that all back to me. I get motion sickness and have vertigo, but absolutely nothing bothered me on this video. Another reviewer commented on giving them motion sickness. I just can't see that with this DVD. I played it with nature sounds only and today played it again with the music. It's mostly flute and some piano, it was very good. I do prefer natural sounds only with no narration, but the music on this disc was really nice. For the price, getting an hour of breathtaking beauty, peacefulness, and absolutely serenity was WELL worth my money! If you like nature videos, I'd suggest also checking out Tony Helsloot's DVDs. He has MANY beautiful nature videos which are awesome too. I own MANY of them. Check on Amazon or Vimeo!!",1425686400,,892,4.47239263803681
8383415,1,B002WYH5U0,"I ended up with a massive headache, and was dizzy from watching.  the cover photo is deceiving as their are no pictures such as the one on the cover.  the photographer panned slowly, and I do mean excruciatingly slowly across several different landscape scenes.  After five minutes of watching this slow pan, it became rather bothersome.  in addition, quite a few of the scenes are duplicated, panning in and out -  basically the same shot.  towards the end the photographer is on some type of boat, taking photos while  moving - further increasing my dizziness.  Do NOT purchase.",1424390400,,580,4.846938775510204
8383416,4,B002WYH5U0,"Disk has option for natural sounds or for music . No verbal communication on the natural sounds option - haven't viewed the music option.  Landscapes are beautiful, sometimes stunning and  photographed at varying times during  the day for best affects of a rising/setting sun .. Photography employs  close ups, stills and scanning techniques.",1419120000,2,342,5.39622641509434
