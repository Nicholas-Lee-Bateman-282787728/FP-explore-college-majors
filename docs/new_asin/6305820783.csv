1079753,5,6305820783,"Wow, what a history lesson! I grew up with this kind of music but never really pictured what I was listening to and this movie is an eye opener!",1379980800,,144,4.0
1079754,5,6305820783,This movie...I thoroughly enjoyed.  Don't believe any negative comments re this DVD.  The music great...as long as you like blues and Dixie.  I am a Billie Holiday fan...and I really liked seeing her in this movie role.  I hope that more film of Billie Holiday is found.,1375488000,,270,4.680851063829787
1079755,4,6305820783,"New Orleans traces the rise of Jazz in the first part of the 20th Century. Wholly inauthentic as a story but a thing of beauty taken in its entirety. Arturo De Cordova, the great Mexican star, and Dorothy Patrick, with Irene Rich, a silent screen beauty and one of the first ladies of radio drama, along with composer Richard Hageman, in a straight acting part play the leads. They are all quite good but predictably  end up in the shadow of the music. Billie Holliday, Woody Herman, Kid Orry and many others are topped in every way  by Louis Armstrong. A great actor as well as musician, he brings his soul to the screen. To be cherished. The Kino Video DVD is just okay and for a musical that isn't quite enough but that's all  brother. The special features may not be ambitious but they are informative and intelligent.

Sidebar re Richard Hageman: He won the Academy Award in 1939 for scoring Stagecoach and throughout the forties Director John Ford used him on several other fine films including She Wore A Yellow Ribbon, Three Godfathers and Wagonmaster.",1358035200,,1060,4.652406417112299
1079756,4,6305820783,"Tells the story of the emergence of Dixieland Jazz primarily through the background love story of two charasmatic people - Miralee Smith, a talented opera singer, and Nick Duquesnes, owner of a Jazz Club-cum-gambling joint, who were at opposite ends of the social strata.  Musical renderings by Billie Holliday, Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman, among others, make it a unique and memorable movie.  There is no other movie like this one out there!",1260662400,2,447,5.109589041095891
1079757,4,6305820783,"The movie showcased the ascent of New Orleans ragtime music versus the uptown music. Miralee Smith (Dorothy Patrick) was the young opera singer who, together with her conductor, was attracted to ragtime music, against the wish of her mother and many. Mrs. Smith, to keep her daughter away from ragtime music and its staunch supporter, Mr. Duquesne (Arturo de Cordova), made sure New Orleans had no place for either of them. And in Chicago Mr. Duquesne popularized the music as jazz.

The real draw, of course, lies in the jazz music as epitomized by Louis Armstrong and his Band, Woody Herman and his Orchestra, and the beautiful voice of Billie Holiday, plus the professional musicians playing the cornet, trombone, clarinet, double bass ... . Billie Holiday exuberates a cool confidence with her unique rich voice and her swaying along the melody. Her rendition of Ms New Orleans was impressive, but the most outstanding moment was when she sang fairwell to Storyville and later  joined by the chorus of the black folks who were forced to leave New Orleans. Not to mention the solo played by Louis Armstrong and Woody Herman.",1167609600,4,1127,4.926315789473684
1079758,4,6305820783,"I am so very glad I bought it, as a person who loves great music and provocative movies, with love as a theme, in all vernaculars (except hip-hop), and a jazz enthusiast at heart it's a love story dotted with great musical contributions from the authentic jazz greats, Louie Armstrong and Billie Holiday to name a few.",1128038400,2,318,4.5964912280701755
1079759,5,6305820783,"I have always found jazz performances much more captivating live rather than recorded, and although I can't travel back in time and see Louis Armstrong play during his prime, this video is the next best thing.
The makers of New Orleans did not waste the talents of the musicians, and a good chunk of the movie is concert footage of many of the giants from the golden age of Jazz including Kid Ory, Woody Herman and Billie Holiday doing old standards such as Basin Street Blues and Do You Know What it Means to Miss New Orleans.
These performances truly convey the joy that enrapt the musicians as they played, and Armstrong in particular, is irresistably charming and funny as usual and appears for much of the film.
Unfortunately, Holiday is possibly the most wooden actress I have ever seen, but since for most of her comparatively short screen time is spent singing, it isn't a problem.
I strongly recommended this one to all fans of early jazz.",1049500800,16,948,4.648809523809524
1079760,4,6305820783,"I bought this DVD blindly just because I'm such a fan of Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and of New Orleans in general. The plot (what there is of it) is clichd and uninteresting, but the music is fantastic, and I ended up playing the musical pieces over and over. The entire movie is filmed on a Hollywood soundstage; if you're looking for shots of old New Orleans, look elsewhere.",996883200,14,382,4.550724637681159
1079761,4,6305820783,"For years I've wanted to see NEW ORLEANS, knowing that thestoryline wouldn't match the quality of the music, and now it is finally available...on DVD no less.  After watching it, I can say that the movie lived up (musically) and down (plotwise) to my expectations. However, with Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong and Billie 'Lady Day' Holiday in prominent roles, the musical strengths more than cancelled out the thematic/cinematic shortcomings.
The musical footage of Holiday and Armstrong (seen in solos and duets) is worth the price of admission, and the entirety of the movie is fairly entertaining if you don't expect too much....
Amid the cliched plot threads...  fortunately the racial stereotypes are quite inoffensive by 1947 standards (albeit Billie is cast as a maid).  Due to the lack of available Billie Holiday footage alone, this movie approaches essential status, at least among jazz fans.
The DVD includes two bonus shorts: a young Louis Armstrong sings and plays in the 1932 A RHAPSODY IN BLACK AND BLUE, and Duke Ellington teams up with a VERY young Billie Holiday in the priceless 1935 short SYMPHONY IN BLACK.",967507200,42,1122,5.086956521739131
7895578,5,6305820783,"I originally borrowed this film from the Enoch Prate Free Library here in Baltimore. It was ""love"" at first viewing.  I was so happy to find it available through AMAZON. If the story is a bit melodramatic and filmed in the style of the time, the music is amazing.  Louis Armstrong plays himself and he is wonderful.  Baltimore's daughter Billie Holiday is the real reason I bought this DVD. So much is made of her last years as a victim of drugs and prejudice.  Well, at this point in time, she commands respect from the moment you see her playing a maid and playing a grand piano. She is breathtaking. The rest of the cast is perfect.  You'll recognize many of the other actors. Finally, the quality of this used DVD was just fine.",1493942400,,732,4.432835820895522

7895580,5,6305820783,"Coming from my history in Jazz, and knowing personally several jazz greats from Armstrong to, Woody Herman, Jack Teagarden, and Vic Moore drummer of the Wolverines, this movie was a very welcome refresher of the history of Jazz from Stormville to Chicago.  The addition of Lady Day is a wonderful way to get to know and listen to Billie Holiday's wonderful voice. The stars in this film are legendary, and some of the greatest ever seen or heard.  It will be a very welcome addition to any Jazz lovers film library for many hours of watching.  Once you hear the song ""New Orleans"" you'll be humming or singing it yourself for days after.",1460246400,,637,4.619469026548672
7895581,5,6305820783,"Without Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday and their musical supporting cast, this would be a forgettable melodrama. To me the most interesting aspect of this movie is the contrast of cultures - the stuffy white world symbolized by classical/operatic music (some very excellent), the blues/jazz world of the downtrodden but resilient black population and the white ""early adopters"" of their music. The music is tremendous. Although this movie would never win an Academy Award except for music, the cast is overall excellent given their material. Anyone who loves Armstrong or Holiday should own this. I saw this on Turner classic movies and I'm going to buy it.",1460073600,,661,5.186915887850467

7895584,5,6305820783,"I had this film on VHS for many years but wanted a back up, just in case.
Anyone who loves Billie or Louis Armstrong will enjoy watching them here.

Many thanks to Goodwill, Seattle for their swift delivery.",1411344000,,207,4.447368421052632
7895585,5,6305820783,"Very pleased with dvd. To be able to see Billie Holiday, Louie and his band whenever I want is a treasure. The last time I saw louis, Velma Middleton and my beautiful Trummy Young was, as a child in Sydney in the early 1950's. Trummy recongised my father, a muso, and bent down to speak with my sister and myself. And, autographs! Such technique and vocal abilities. Man. Swing on! Marilyn",1408579200,,389,4.492957746478873
7895586,5,6305820783,"Phenomenal musical line up with Louis Armstrong, Billie Holliday, Kid Ory, Woody Herman and  other legendary jazz players.  A classic portrait of Storyville, it's demise and the migration of jazz north, coast to coast and around the world.",1390608000,,239,5.2631578947368425
7895587,4,6305820783,"It was a wonderful old movie; and particularly historic in that it was (I believe) the only one in which both Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong were featured. So, that was a treat. I grew up listening to both of those great giants of Jazz. The story line of the film was rather trite, by modern standards. Indicitive of the times. But, the music portions were absolutely fabulous; and that was what I really purchased this film for. If you love classic Jazz and the people who made that music, you couldn't do better than to review this old movie from a time long ago in our American history.",1383523200,,593,4.4495412844036695
