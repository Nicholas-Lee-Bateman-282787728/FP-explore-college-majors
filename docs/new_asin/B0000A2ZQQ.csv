7996013,3,B0000A2ZQQ,"Despite the fact that I bought this movie, I honestly have no idea how good it is.  I bought it strictly because Idaho's Governor, C.L. ""Butch"" Otter, has a small speaking part and have limited my viewing to his scene.  Butch looks good.  It's probably not a very good movie.",1445990400,,275,4.46

7996018,5,B0000A2ZQQ,"Why doesn't Hollywood make more Westerns?  I can't get enough, and I know that I'm not the only one out there.  Accordingly, I was very pleased to hear that A Time To Revenge was coming out on DVD.  Great action in the classic style.  Check it out!",1146787200,,248,4.212765957446808
7996019,2,B0000A2ZQQ,"The producers made this movie a sort of catchall for all interest, althought classified as a modern western. It includes some adventure, romance, music, violence, and yes--sex. Although it bears an ""R"" rating, I presume it must be for theme.  I had a little trouble stay tuned . Found in the bargain bin, as low budget movie, pick it up if you like and give it a try.",1111017600,4,367,4.397058823529412
