387717,5,6301880447,"It's difficult to me, to be objective with this film. So I resign. Simply, this Turandot's record is a document of the TOTAL SPECTACLE, as well as Wagner wanted that his operas were the Total Master Work , Puccini achieved it.
The opera is beautiful, exciting and covers all the Puccini's forts: the drama, the lyricism of the Italian melody, the dense modern orquestacin, the tenderness, the cruelty, the visceral thing, the humor, the grotesque thing, the exotismo; and any sewing as a perfect suit, that alone we are sorry that it was remaining incomplete with "" the death of the master "", as Toscanini said, but whose Alfano's conclusion is sufficient.
This version possesses the performances and magnificent voices of Marton and Domingo. It is a testimony to possess the version in alive of Domingo (in study with Karajan), whose Calaf's immaculate conception, his performance fills of details and performances promoted by Zeffirelli, and taken advantage by the direction of Kirk Browning's cameras, is unforgetable. Marton, in one of her several Turandot's recordings, is powerful as her princess's role indicates, chill seemingly, but betrayed by several reactions of flirtation, and feminine surprise (in the cruxes seduced by the Calaf-Domingo's courage and in the torture of the Act 3 for Liu's loyalty); her voice resounds in the stage and melts the people, the Metropolitan and this spectator in his house. Hitherto this record already is a marvel. But these performances are inside a fabulous scenery (Zeffirelli), allegoric choreographies of China very beautiful and integrated to the moments of masses (cruxes and overcoat the wonderful final), many details of creation as for the libretto (Calaf's loving look to Timur-Liu after his victory, for example, again Zefirelli and opportunists for the camera), the choir (another personage in this opera) and the orchestra of the Metropolitan they work fabulously (some goofs of the direct take in VHS seemingly have been corrected in the step to the DVD).
Leona Mitchell's Liu does not make us forget the Scotto or Barbara Hendricks, she fulfills with her voice but she loses the concentration in any moments. Paul Plishka is a blind and aggrieved Timur for the pursuit, disconcerted by the attitude of his son, and subdued by Liu's death. Three masks are impeccably portrayed by Schexnayder (what will be of him?), Glassman and Laciura; justifying absolutely the incorporation of this curious comic trio in the action and also sometimes fearsome. Their unfolding with another dancers' trio that takes part in the ceremonies is interesting.
Will it be necessary to say that the sound is fabulous and the image (putting to test in the night scenes) of impeccable invoice?
This DVD is the whole experience. If you know someone who hates and does not understands the opera, give him this gift.",1074902400,9,2851,5.146551724137931
387718,5,6301880447,"Esta produccion de 1989 en el Met es la mejor opcion existente para ver Turandot. Esplendido y lujosisimo montaje escenico (de FRANCO ZEFIRELLI, que sabe usar bien los movimientos de masas para crear efectos impresionantes en una escenografia mucho mas convencional de lo que parece). Vocalmente rinden sobresalientemente el heroico y apasionado Calaf de PLACIDO DOMINGO, la sensible, y extraordinariamente cantada Liu de LEONA MITCHEL y ese coloso que es EVA MARTON, una Turandot que ya impresiona desde su primera aparicion, hacia la mitad de la obra, con 'In questa reggia'. Notable PAUL PLISHKA como Timur, al igual que todos los secundarios (todos ellos 'de la casa') entre los que destaca la presencia del veteranisimo HUGUES GUENOD como el Emperador Altoum.
JAMES LEVINE consigue una de sus mas destacables interpretaciones al mando de los cuerpos estables del Met (tambien extraordinarios coros y orquesta por cierto), dotando a la obra de toda la fuerza que precisa.",1068163200,5,975,5.296774193548387
387719,4,6301880447,"If you want a conventional production of Turandot -- i.e., one that attempts to set the opera in some interpretation of ancient China -- this is the one for you.  As usual with Zeffirelli productions at the Met, no expense is spared in producing the spectacle.  Peking in Act I is depicted in a multi-level set as a teeming hive of activity, amongst which Mandarins and soldiers push their way.  The emperor's palace in Act II, Scene 2, is as lush as any illustration in any edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  The chorus and extras probably double the number used in most productions. The costumes are varied and rich in detail.  And so on...
None of this is meant to be a criticism, just a description of the production values.  The Met assembled an impressive cast to handle the big four roles, and they handled them all well.  Eva Marton and Kathleen Battle both sing well and appear lovely in the roles of the female protagonists.  Placido Domingo illustrates in his portrayal of Calaf why he is the primario of the so-called three tenors.  Paul Plishka sings the somewhat lesser role of Timur at a level of intensity and ability commensurate with the rest of the cast.
My criticisms, admittedly small, with this performance lie in two areas.  First, the three ministers, Ping, Pang, and Pong, generally seem to fade into the background.  The Met reached into its stable of comprimarios to cast these roles, and it shows.  They don't compare well to the enormous primario horsepower that appears on the stage.
Second, a few Zeffirelli tricks don't work.  Primary among these is the replacement of the singing Ping, Pang, and Pong with masked dancers during the trial scene.  The ""masks"" cavort around and pull flags out of Turandot's back as Calaf successfully answers the three riddles.  Now what is this all about?
Nonetheless, if you have never seen Turandot, this isn't a bad starting point.  Then, when you have it down, go take a look at the San Francisco and Saltzburg productions.  The contrasts will make you wonder what would have happened had Puccini lived only a couple of years more.",1064102400,12,2098,4.751381215469613
387720,5,6301880447,"This is one of the best opera DVD's I have ever seen. You could not ask for more. It was recorded during one of those MET nights where everything goes perfect.
The title role is held perfectly by Marton. She isn't a great opera actress, but she IS a great soprano, and for Turandot that's enough.
As for Domingo's warm voice, it has rarely been more enchanting. For him, everything went perfect that night. Calaf's role suits him perfectly in both acting and singing. You could see him suffering during high C's, but this is even more thrilling especially since they come out perfectly.
Mitchell's Liu adds the cherry to the perfect Cake, while Levine's traditional conducting is amazing.
Zeffirelli's sets alone would have made a good reason why to buy this DVD. Acts I and II are majestuous.
Finally, the DVD's digital sound and image quality are outstanding. In summary, everything is Perfect!
Highly Recommended.",1060300800,211,916,4.878205128205129
387721,5,6301880447,"How can a 40-year old Hungarian woman portray a twenty-something pre-Medieval Chinese princess? Very well is the answer. Many people feel that Marton is the definitive Turandot of our generation. She has power to spare in her voice, and although her acting is minimalist, it's by no means wooden. There's an economy of gesture, but she mimics many of the hand movements of the Peking opera and comes across as convincing.
Leona Mitchell, a large American woman playing a frail Asian slave, is less convincing to watch, but was in great voice on the night this was recorded at the Met. Domingo is the favorite tenor of many people and sings well here too. All the supporting cast members are well-chosen, and the ensemble movement is particularly effective--it looks as if there's a cast of 1,000s on the stage.
If you've seen opera at a provincial house, this is a good way to see how they do it at the Met, with the good (excellent musical preparation), the bad (endless curtain calls) and the ugly (Jimmy Levine mugging a self-satisfied smirk for the cameras, or is that how he really looks?).
It isn't quite a perfect opera: Puccini was beyond weird in his relations with women and knows nothing other than ""love at first sight."" And this opera was famously finished after Puccini's death by Franco Alfani, his pupil. There's a big bump in the score when you get to the Alfani bits--we move from daring modern harmonies, to something that sounds like a rehearsal pianist vamping major triads. But interesting for all that.
Highly recommended--if you own one opera on tape, this should be it.",1041552000,18,1594,4.778985507246377
387722,5,6301880447,"This video is in my top 5 favorites because of the production which is the very best the Met has to offer.  Even better than Aida!  Zefferilli is the master and the dream cast is almost perfect.  The roles are highly demanding vocally as the tessitura is very high.  I think the sets and costumes are unequaled in any other opera available on video.  A friend of mine who has seen almost all of the Met productions in the last 10 years has confirmed this as the best.  I am looking forward to LA Opera's version to be performed in 2002 with a new ending being written for a premier here.  I'm not unhappy with the existing one, but something new and different, if good, is also welcome.  Mitchell is a triumph as Liu (the audience goes nuts); Marton works very hard, manages vocally and dramatically to exceed performances than almost anyone else in this role (its a voice-killer!); Paul Plishka as Timur was excellent as was the chorus and orchestra under the baton of Levine.  Domingo looks totally wonderful and except for one little crack in his voice when his fortisimo was over the limits of the voice, also almost perfect. Domingo slighted his support at the end of Nessun Dorma and ran out of breath but covered it quite masterly.  If they would have allowed him to move closer to the audience, doubt if he would have made this fluff.  Who cares!  He looked quite good in that soft teal leather!  Not to nitpick! If you could only buy ONE opera video or thinking of a first purchase of an opera video - make it this one!  You'll watch it over and over again - and it has a happy ending!!  I bought the VHS when issued and later it was the my first LD. Truly Grand Opera! Highly recommended!!!",996796800,22,1700,4.403846153846154
387723,4,6301880447,"I wish to thank the two prior reviewers of this recording for confirming its provenance as the Levine set done at the Met for Deutsche Grammophon. I have not purchased the VHS version but the Laserdisc, and that format is  effective too. As I recall, the Liu of this recording (as I recall, Barbara  Hendricks) is the same one as in the Karajan studio recording, and she  acquits herself very well on both of them. The rest of the cast generally  is very fine, and special marks go to the chorus.  The ascent of the moon  in Act I, when yet another unsuccessful suitor meets his dark fate, is very  moving, particularly aided by the stage sets and original costuming.
Domingo as Calaf is self-recommending and he acts the role well too.  I  have some reservations about Eva Marton's performance in the title role -  hence 4 stars instead of 5 - as she has a noticeable beat in her voice, and  in spite of the costuming does not look at all like an irresistable  Princess that men would literally be willing to risk their heads over. It  would be difficult to criticize her acting because the role does not  require much of it. Vocally she is no match for Joan Sutherland in this  role, nothwithstanding the difference between live and studio conditions.  To be fair, she is better here than in the 1983 Turandot done live in  Vienna with Jose Carreras and Maazel conducting, also available on VHS.  Levine conducts very forcefully and revels in Puccini's exotic percussion  and chromaticism. He also handles the Franco Alfano ending as well as  possible. It is a great tragedy that Puccini died from throat cancer before  completing Act III.  The scene of Liu's death is as inspired in its own  right as the Liebestod, and then the chords introducing Calaf's  ""Principessa d'iglessa"", where Alfano takes over, hit you like a  diatonic jolt.
Overall, this remains a very enjoyable experience and  gives a thrilling idea of experiencing a live performance at the Met.  Highly recommended.",960854400,78,1986,4.730994152046784
387724,5,6301880447,"An excellent work. Mr. Levine is faithfull to G. Puccini's musical drama and the singers convey the tragic and emotional moments of the plot with  full force.

387788,5,6301880447,"Turandot is a beautiful opera with a happy ending. It was Puccini's final work, completed by his student Franco Alfano Puccini's death. The MET production is spectacular with beautiful costumes, great acting, great voices, and great ballet. It is staged to reflect Chinese culture very accurately. There is another opera performed at Forbidden City in China, which has even a grander scale. But, the Met production is more intimate with better singing and acting. I had purchased the VHS version of this opera, but the DVD has better fidelity of image, better sound, and a better English version of subtitles. It also has subtitles in other languages.

387790,4,6301880447,"This is my favorite Puccini opera. The Met did a wonderful job with Zeferelli's sets, the costuming is spectacular, the choreography adds a lot to the production, as well as the wonderful chorus. The orchestra under Levine has always been top notch. Marton does a great job as Turandot. She is regal and haughty. Ping, Pang and Pong are a delight. Leona Mitchell has a beautiful voice and her acting was very convincing as Liu. However, she has a fair amount of vibrato, which I found did not communicate the delicacy and innocence of Liu, and was too similar to Marton's voice. Placido Domingo - what can I say? He was made for the part of Calaf. His voice has such beauty and depth, and he communicates his passion so convincingly. I loved the interactions between him and Marton, her rejection of him as he continued to pursue her. Her change in attitude was completely believable to me. She played her part exceedingly well, probably because Placido Domingo was so spectacular. I loved the little intimate touches he added to his performance as he wooed Turandot.

Bad parts: the quality. I swear to God this is the last DVD I ever buy. If it's not on Blu-Ray, then I  must not need it. But mostly I was surprised at how bad Placido was in this. There are some roles he is made for, but Calaf simply is not it. Not only is it the worst rendition of Nessun Dorma I've ever heard, but he actually sung a part differently in the second act from how I've ever heard it sung and I swear he did it to avoid straining his voice so he'd be fresh for the 3rd act. None of the notes in the second act are held long enough by the way. In any case, find the Nessun Dorma from the MET that's on Blu Ray. That one is not perfect, but it's better than this. Oh how I wish I could have gotten a performance of Turandot on Blu Ray starring Joan Sutherland, Mirella Freni and most of all Luciano Pavarotti, but alas it simply does not exist.",1456963200,,1026,4.1767676767676765

387875,5,6301880447,"This is tremendous production. The singing (with the exception of the emperor) is top notch. The acting is emotional. The music and the chorus were all fantastic. Despite being recorded live, the sound quality is as clear as a studio recording.
The first thing that is very gratifying about this DVD is the SUBTITLES!!! Holy s***! THE FIRST opera that I've watched, whether live or from a recording, that literally translate ALL of the librettos and follow closely with the singing. The English translation isn't perfect, some liberties were taken to make sure the non-Italian speaking audience understands, but they are close enough. This really made the viewing significantly easier and smoother. Because with the translation I can see just how beautifully written the libretto was. I never understood why people object to subtitles. But this time, it has been done right!
The set is also fabulous, and unlike other versions of Turandot, the set and the acting pretty much all directly corresponded to the meaning of the libretto, so it makes it easier to understand and made the performance more natural. I only wished that Domingo had done this performance much younger than in this production. Here he is already entering the 50s, so age-wise not really suited for Calaf anymore. You can also tell that he has sung this role way too many times already because he has a bit of a smugness for the role. Whereas in his earlier year performances (e.g. 1982 in La Scala), there was a bit of uneasiness and more focus and passion, and also the acting is a little bit more physical, which suited the character of Calaf better. Whereas here Domingo has this smirk at times, which is fine but I just like his younger year performances better without it. But his singing is fantastic as always--gentle phrasing on the language, smooth transitions and powerful ring of voice resolves in velvet-like softness. Eva Marton is very good as Turandot, she also closely follows the character of Turandot as written. Her acting is not always natural but she does all of the emotional spectrum, unlike other performances of Turandot that I've seen which tend to be more stale. Marton's chemistry with Domingo is also smoking! Leona Mitchel is also great as Liu. The other main casts all sang their parts excellently. Especially to note are the three tenors who sang ping pong and pang. Best trio from any performances that I've heard. Top-notch singers who harmonized perfectly.

A couple of minor complaints:
Although I know that it's an opera set in a fictional China, I still wish that they at least stick to some fundamentally known style of costumes. Why is the emperor in black and wearing the clothes of an official? Is he supposed to be mourning or something? Which doesn't make sense since even the libretto tells you that the color of mourning in China is white not black. The emperor always wear golden color unless you are talking about extremely early dynasties, which then wouldn't match the rest of the set and costumes, or when the story supposedly has taken place. The set designer also seemed to confuse what the emperor is suppose to wear on his head. As two people (I'm not sure what they were supposed to be) standing slightly lower than the emperor actually wear the emperor's crown, whereas the emperor wears the official's head piece. It's just totally laughable to me, a Chinese, while watching this.
The emperor's singing was just bad. The singer portrayed an emperor shaking in his boots the whole time. Okay, I know that it's fictional and that supposedly even the emperor is a bit wary of the princess, but still, seriously? The emperor of China acting like a weasel old man? Unless the libretto specifically mentions it (it doesn't), it's just not how it's supposed to be. The emperor of China is supposed to be glorious and divine. I like the La Scala version of the emperor, and even with that one the emperor still looks a bit too humbled. But the bottom line is, the way he acted in this production seriously compromised his singing, which I find to be the worst thing you can do.

But if you like Turandot, I really do think that you should take a look at this one. It's quite a fantastic production overall. I wished that I would have seen it live. But I'm grateful for this recording to enter my collection.",1443484800,,4329,4.770666666666667

I've read the libretto, listened to the music, researched all the analyses and criticisms I can find, and watched the DVD a few times - and I'm still struggling to find anything to like, apart from the Nessun Dorma aria which courtesy of the Three Tenors I'd heard already.  But to me it feels as if this opera - and Zeffirelli's production of it - is a ham-fisted, Western trivialisation of a culture that has been poorly understood by non-Chinese for far too long.  I think the plot is foolish, the ideas more so, and the protagonists unlikeable.  I appreciate that opera isn't necessarily realistic, but I defy anyone to convince me that a plot line like this one is credible on any level.

As for the production - Zeffirelli's set is cluttered and distracting, as if he's thrown in everything remotely Chinese-looking into the mix, then given it a stir.  Eva Marton doesn't look much like a beautiful ice princess.  She shrieks a lot.  It's hard to understand why Calaf fell in love with her.  This makes Calaf's decision - to turn his back on Liu, and risk his life for a callous murderer - equally incomprehensible.  And that makes Liu's unconditional devotion hard to swallow as well... and so it goes on.

I'm going to try closing my eyes and just listening to the music next time - perhaps then I'll find out why this work is so popular.  The opera must have something going for it to have survived this long in the repertoire and I wish I knew what it was.",1433980800,6,1579,4.406896551724138

The Ping, Pang, Pong trio had their act together and sang the heck out of the opening of the second act.  I loved the DTS 5.1 mix, which was an unexpected bonus.

I've read the quibbling in some other reviews about dim lighting, Zeffirelli excesses, etc. Since I have seen no other production I lack standards for comparison, so I have to say I'm quite pleased overall. BUT...there is horrible digital audio distortion when Marton and Domingo are ""pressing hard""!!!

I'll admit I'm not a big fan of Turandot, but this production does nothing to win me over.  Did they not pay the light bill?  It's so dark during the opening scenes that you can't see what's happening.  I'm not sure what effect they were trying to achieve with the direction, lighting, and camera work, but I felt like I was watching rats scurrying around in a dimly lit sewer.  Bizarre costumes in some cases (e.g., Turandot).

Bottom line:  unlistenable and unwatchable.

In contrast, following are my recommendations for wonderful film adaptations of Puccini operas:

1. La Boheme starring Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon
2. Madame Butterfly starring Ying Huang and Richard Troxell

This lavish production seems to me to be a monument to Zeffarelli and the Met to how much they can spend on a production and get away with it.  It is opulent and overblown.  There is so much unnecessary, fussy action on statge that it distracts from the singers.  The Chinese dragon prancing in the middle of the first act was distracting and incongruous.  It is as if Mr. Zeffarelli put in everything he could think of that was Chinese regardless of whether it was apt.  Everyone seems to be singing at top volume with no subtlety or grace.  I felt sorry for Paul Plishka having to waddle about like Attila the Teddy Bear.  Domingo is the only one in this cast who seems to redeem himself.  I like Eva Marton's work but amplifying her voice destroyed any beauty.  ""In questa reggia"" may as well have been spoken through a microphone.  Levine's conducting is superb but there has to be more than the orchestra to redeem a production.  I'm sorry I wasted my money purchasing this recording.",1306368000,5,1052,4.507936507936508

387988,3,6301880447,"Yes...this is a grand production,with huge everything...sets,scenery etc.,but as a finished product I'm not sure this is the best of the best.
The singers are fine, and they even act well. Ms. Mitchell built a good career,a lot of which was devoted to her role as liu, which she sang all over the world. Domingo is fine-a big role for him,but despite a failure to navigate a high C- a note that he has never had anyway,his work is very good. Marton has the vocal power and a pleasing enough voice. Plishka looks, plays, and sings the part wonderfully. Ping,Pang and Pong are just right,with Ping offering a truly beautiful baritone. The orchestra led by Maestro Levine is adaquate,but not thrilling. Part of the problem, on a metaphysical level is the ability of anyone or anything to match the Zeffirelli stage. But,the general failure of the highly touted Metropolitain opera chorus to command it's role in this production astounds me. The first tenors missed ""fuggi.fuggi-only one being sung, and sounding like one tenor at that! The following ""Va Va""...Va Va""is flat and amateurishly sung. Now this is a live recording and I do understand that fact-still, cues are cues and proper technique is proper technique. During this Met chrorus' history waeknesses were often evident, whcih were worked on under new direction,but I've always felt the Met chorus to be highly overrated. Believe me, having sung in the chorus of this opera,the role of the chorus is of prime importance. You may also notice a big voiced lead soprano, with a rather aged and wobbly attack. I spent time on the chorus here because hardly anyone else does.
It was an OK production,but give me the Corelli,Nilsson productions hands down every time. None has ever matched the power and beauty of sound. Imagine- they did it without a Zeffirelli set and a budget only God could afford.",1282435200,3,1855,4.8734177215189876
387989,5,6301880447,"Ever since my taste in music did a 180 and all I now listen to is classical music, I have been in love with nessun dorma.  One of my newer recordings had this breathtaking climax of music that turned out to be the Turandot's first act closing.  That sealed it for me, I had to see the opera.  My PBS station aired it and I recorded it.  In replaying it, just as Turandot entered for her first scene, a previously set program came on and that was the end of that recording of Turandot.  All that was left to do was purchase it.  Upon arrival I opened the DVD, trying not to use my teeth to get the wrapping off, then sat back in comfort to watch Turandot.  It was everything I could have hoped for.  My ruined recording was a Franco Zeffirelli production but all that was available was an earlier Zeffirelli production, but as a consolation prize, I got Placido Domingo.  Sublime.

As a plot line, Turandot's refusal to gracefully accept her loss and live up to her bargain made me want to somehow slap her silly face, but since one cannot do that, I tried to ignore that part of the story.  When that happens I know the author has done well.",1271203200,2,1141,4.26046511627907

387994,5,6301880447,"Turandot is the one Puccini Opera that lends itself to the most opulent of settings. Franco Zefferelli is one of the few producer/directors who could fill the expanse of the Met stage with jewels in a setting. Domingo is at the height of his career and Marton is perfect as the icy princess. Kudos especially to Leona Mitchell as Liu and Paul Plishka as Calaf's father, Timur. Incidentally, there are the best Ping, Pang and Pong I've ever heard or seen. Grab your copy before it disappears from any profferings or gets a price like Julia Migenes' ""Carmen"" of $1,500.00. This production is a must-have for any listener of opera.",1241654400,3,628,4.718181818181818
387995,4,6301880447,"For those who are familiar with 'Madame Butterfly' and 'Tosca', 'Turandot' is a considerable hurdle for some opera viewers and lovers. Puccini was the great heir to Verdi, he had established himself with 'Manon Lescaut' and created hits with his verismo works such as 'Il Tabaro' and 'La Boheme'

So why is 'Turandot' a hurdle? First it was left unfinished. Puccini died in November 1924 succumbing to throat cancer. Alfano, under the great conductor Toscanini finished the opera. The composer had left behind sketches and notes for the last act. (When you watch the opera, everything is Puccini until Liu's final aria in Act III, scene 1.) So what begins as Puccini ends as what others believe Puccini wanted. Of course it is excellent, true to form and as good as its going to get. Secondly, despite Calaf's and Liu's moving arias (especially 'Nessum Dorma' made famous by the NFL and 'Moonstruck'), the music is getting closer and closer to the modern styles of Strauss, Berg and the atonal crowd of composers of the early twentieth century. Where before we hear the beautiful motifs of Mimi and Rudolfo, flowing in and out of the music, 'Turandot' offers a musical circus of expressions, medleys, tempos. It is a richer Puccini, diverse, eclectic, multicultural but not as endearing.

In consideration of the performances, I feel strongly it is Leona Mitchell as Liu that steals the show. As an audience we are drawn to the hero because he challenges Turandot, he wants to solve her three riddles and marry, all at the risk of losing his life. Yes, it is captivating and it keeps us bound to the story. But Domingo as Calaf and Eva Marton as the Princess, although we are satisfied with their performance, not completely moved. Perhaps it is the role of Liu but I'm sure, very positive it was Mitchell's delivery - her singing gave me shivers. This also has to do with Puccini's style at the time. When Domingo and Marton are given the chance to sing, they are closer to the modern whereas Liu's arias feel closer to the earlier Puccini most of us know and love. I fell in love with Mitchell's voice.

Domingo's strongest role, I feel is Otello. Here, he is just a little too close to not pulling it off. His 'Nessun Dorma' doesn't have the gravity and power of Pavarotti's. If there were any other weaknesses, it doesn't show until he sings at night about how none shall sleep. Impressive, obviously but it won't shatter through your soul. I still think Domingo is a better actor and his love for the princess is heartfelt.

This opera is a satisfying challenge. The staging is excellent, the sets incredible, all the exotic notes are there, the chorus delivers. Zeffirelli's direction is a must-see. It is a visual splendor matched with a haunting fairy tale story. Well worth the time and dedication to know it but truly, keep your eyes and ears open for Mitchell.

Then, why I am giving to this Turandot 5 stars?  Well I do not have a rational answer to that question.  I have to confess that these 5 stars come from the depths of my heart and have nothing to do with my brains.  I really love Turandot,  I think this is Puccini at his best, moving dangerously close to that thin line that separates the sublime from the bad taste, but always moving on the sublime side.  Therefore you need an extremely intelligent stage director that would avoid crossing that line to the kitch side.  Curiosly Zefirelli succeed doing that!!!! I never thougth that Zefirelli was that inteligent!!!  I love Placido Domingo, I think he enhances every opera in which he sings and this Turandot is not an exception.  I always have serious difficulties following the line of Turandot's parts and hate that particular spinto way of singing used by most sopranos that sing this role.  However Eva Marton does an extraordinary job here.  Indeed she instills some sweetness into this rather cold role.  The scene of the three riddles in the second act is impecable.  The acting of both,  Marton and Domingo, is legendary to say the less.  You feel the tension and the anguish of the characters on stage.  Liona Mitchell is beautiful and delicate in her impersonation of Liu.  The scene of her death in the third act is particularly moving.  The action all through the opera goes fast paced thanks to the phenomenal singers/actors, the stage director and James Levine great (as always) musical direction.  Fully recommended.  This is a completely unbiased appreciation of this wonderful opera and production since I watched it, in the first place, with the sick intention of critizicing it badly.",1213833600,6,1848,4.803174603174603

The one who stole the show was Liu - Leona Mitchell.  A voice of an angel, innocent and full of emotion.  The entire opera lacked believability.  The story itself is unbelievable, so it takes a master director to make the audience be transported to China to witness this love story.  It was the first time I have even seen Calaf sing Nessum Dorma seated!  He looked very uncomfortable.  Marton was truly an ice goddess but even when she realized then end result, she was cold.

So why the one star and the title: Tutto Dorma/ Jay David Saks SUCKS?
Opera is an all encompassing audio-visual art form. Sound balance is critical. As the audio producer, Saks must have been asleep while recording the audio portion of this DVD. How else can you explain the awful sound imbalance? All singers are constantly overpowered by the orchestra: the principals sound as though they are singing in a cave a mile deep inside while the recording microphone is placed in the midst of  a pile of  bat guano at the entrance just adjacent to the orchestra. Time to wake up and tinker with your audio-control panel Mr. Saks...and shame to DG for allowing the release of this DVD before such correction.

Additionally, Kirk Browning the video director must have been short of funds when hiring his camera crew. From the looks of things, he must have hired a crew of 3 year olds who had never handled a camera prior to this occasion: the focus either constantly shifts from close-ups to pan-outs at random intervals without attention to the action or to side shots of no particular interest or connection to the action on stage.
And, of course, he too must have been a 'dorma' while directing the visuals-- otherwise, in good conscience how would he have allowed such ""visuals"".

Two other less significant quibbles:
The first-  also, in part, relates to the camera operators: a lot of the action is partly obstructed by the throng of supernumeraries sitting at the apron of the stage during a significant portion of the opera; was this really necessary Mr. Zefirelli--- and if so, why couldn't the camera shoot over their heads allowing an otherwise unobstructed view of the stage?
The second- the stage was very dark ( i.e. lack of lighting) during much of the first Act and a significant portion of the second Act.

Again: opera is an audio-visual art. With crappy sound and poor visuals the enjoyment factor is markedly lessened for the viewing audience. Shame on DG for releasing this otherwise excellent Turandot.",1207612800,17,2219,4.898666666666666

Eva Marton as Turandot and Placido Domingo as Calaf both sang as they should, and no more. Marton is sufficiently cold and aloof as the title role princess, and Domingo in fine vocal condition, with perhaps the exception of the famous aria Nessun Dorma. Leonie Mitchell is convincing as Liu both vocally and visually. The biggest bonus, however, comes from the male trio Ping, Pang and Pong. Their excerpt in the second Act is actually the pointer to the theme of the story, and usually in Chinese literature this type of pointer is of fundamental importance. The producer rightly places adequate emphases on this scene, and the three singers really performed marvellously both in terms of singing and acting.
The only slight dramatic flaw in this production is the lack of significant high light for the change of heart of Turandot after the death of Liu. Marton could have acted more effectively, but she left most the changes to be brought out by the libretto alone.
The music, however, really could not be bettered under James Levine's firm conducting. Generally speaking, this is a very entertaining production of a famous Pucini work.",1194912000,2,1434,4.979166666666667

James Levine and the Met Orchestra are in superb form - drawing all the drama and exoticism out of this dynamic score.

Perhaps it's a singer who isn't on par with his or her cast members, or -- more likely these days -- the design and/or directorial ""concept"" is anachronistic and distracting.  But there's absolutely nothing -- and I mean nothing -- that doesn't work about this Met ""Turandot.""  One can quibble perhaps with the scope of Zeffirelli's production, but for once his obsession with size pays off.  This is an Asian fairytale, and the design is appropriately fantastical.  (I actually recommend that, if you get the chance, you see this production in the house, as it has to be experienced live to be believed.)  And the VOICES!!  I was leery about Marton and Mitchell, as I haven't always loved their work in the past; but they're brilliant.  As is Mr. Domingo, whom I've always loved.

That said it is a wonderful production that I and my six y.o.  daughter appreciate.  Domingo is in fine voice and the ladies as Turandot  and Liu are spectacular.

Five Stars. [A-]  Wonderful production.  Only two possible flaws to note.  The first is that the stage is so chocked full of people at times that it is hard follow the action (at least this is true for small fry).  And second, there is a slight flaw in the recording quality in the last act.  We are happy with this production and would gladly purchased it again.

Notes for Parents of Young Children:  The music and production is delightful,  HOWEVER, like many opera's this one has some violence. There are heads-on-pikes at one point.  Not to mention the hunky swordsman who is sharpening his blade in order to decapitate that poor Prince of Persia.

I vowed that when it came out on DVD, I would be the first to get a copy. This was over 3 years ago! I watch this DVD repeatedly and I am still bowled over with the overall effect of the singing and staging. Eva Marton as Turandot has been superbly costumed and directed by Franco Zefferelli and to my ears, a fine Turandot. She owns the stage in Act 2 Scene 2 and her curtain call at the end of the opera is a well-deserved ovation! Domingo had a bit of an off night with this performance, but still manages to deliver the goods as Calaf. Leona Mitchell will make you cry with her singing as Liu and the rest of the cast is first rate! This will be a difficult choice amongst some people, however the only competition will be the 1983 Vienna Turandot with Harold Prince directing and Lorin Maazel conducting.",1150156800,14,1074,4.429292929292929

The costumes weren't interesting, the sets tended to be stylized and even the music seemed to be rambling and pointless.  I tried listening to the opera on CD, with much the same reaction.  Then, one night I happened to see this production on PBS and the opera totally changed for me.  Zeffirelli had somehow managed to pull this opera together and make it interesting to watch and to listen to.  Suddenly the opera seemed to make sense and I was drawn into the production. The entire cast was excellent and I disagree with a previous reviewer who felt that Leona Mitchell wasn't effective as Liu.

388063,5,6301880447,"I've seen Turandot performed live, the latest by the Kirov Opera at the Kennedy Center, and I've watched videos, but this is the very first Turandot where the majesty of the music matched what I was seeing on stage, and where I was able to really understand how Turandot came to her final acceptance of the love she feels for Calaf.

Marton's Turandot is minamalist, but more would not, I think, have been better.  Her voice is glorious.  When I think of Turandot, her performance is the one I'll remember.

Mitchell's Liu makes me cry every time.

And, of course, Domingo is Domingo.  I think he was born to play Calaf.

Ping, Pang and Pong were, for once, not just slapstick figures.  They were played not only with humor, but also with a depth of feeling that is lacking in some other performances.

And, yes, the parts that Alfano wrote are different, and yes, Liu's death scene is masterful, and the last ""real"" Puccini that ever was -- but even after multiple watchings of this DVD, my jaw still drops when I see the final scene of Act III.  Zeffirelli, better than anyone else I've ever seen direct Turandot, has come close to matching the glory of the music that Alfano put together from Puccini's themes.

Even after multiple viewings, I still get a shiver down my spine when the chorus sings ""Decimilla anni al nostro Imperatore!"", and I still thrill at the final ""Gloria!"".

388065,5,6301880447,"Deutsche Grammophne produces first-class opera and classical music on recording and DVD and this 1988 performance of Turandot from the Met is visually the best. It stars Eva Marton in the title role, Placido Domingo as Prince Calaf, Leona Mitchell as Liu and Paul Plishka as the Tartar King. It is thanks to Italian film director Franco Zefferelli that this Turandot has gained special notoriety. The afterparty was rumored to have been a grand affair in itself, and the press photos were in the cover of Opera News. Guests at the party included Elizabeth Taylor who attended the premiere. This is exactly the type of grand opera that fits Zefferelli's taste for the grandiose, lush color, scenic backdrops, huge crowd scenes and lavish design. The costumes are particularly striking. Eva Marton looks and sings the part with virtuosic aplomb, though she does not convey too much characterization when compared to such celebrated Turandots as Eva Turner, Ghena Dimitrova and most notably Birgit Nilsson. Still, Turandot is wonderful as the man-hating, icy Princess of Peking. Placido Domingo was born to play Calaf, for he acts the part with aplomb. He sings wonderfully, with a voice that perfectly captures heroism and Puccini's vision of this determined prince. Domingo was criticized for taking on such a difficult part (in truth it is Puccini's most difficult tenor part) but it is a performance that is yet to be surpassed. His ""Nessun Dorma"" is far more moving and emotinally direct than the showy, meaningless manner that Pavarotti sang it. Domingo is the real reason I bought this DVD. It's sad that he was paired with weaker singers. If Eva Marton does not potray a dramatically moving Turandot (who goes from goddess to mortal woman in love in the course of only a few hours) Leona Mitchell fails visibly as the slave girl Liu. Leona has the right voice, sweetened but full-lyric, but she is a large woman who cannot possibly understand what it is like to be a frail, lovesick slave who is driven to suicide. I prefer smaller Lius (like those of Renata Scotto and Cecilia Gazdia). This is a dream of a Turandot however and looks stunning. We are whisked away to another time and place. It is a mythic China, a Shangri-La where a princesss under a dark spell is saved by a Prince. Enjoy!",1131926400,13,2297,4.847328244274809

2. Blood...This cast has passion.  Levine is divine.  Domingo is a strong Calaf with a dramatic voice that soars over Puccini's masterpiece.  His acting is tremendous as usuall.  Mitchell is the bonus of this great cast.  She sings flawlessly and one of the best Liu I have heard.

3. Turandot...Eva Marton might not be the best Turandot, but that does not matter.  When she and Domingo were singing in act III it was magic.  When she was shedding tears while singing my heart palpitated to a renewed passion of why I loved Opera to begin with.  My eyes and ears where glued to my home theater.  For all I care Marton and Domingo could have cracked their voices and it would have not mattered to me a bit, cause folks the stars were alligned right over the Met that night.  I have not seen Metha's version of the Turandot, but this is the best Turandot I have seen so far.",1131235200,15,961,4.301675977653631
388067,4,6301880447,"Well, this is a very large turandot.  The sets are lavish and the stage action is evocative of chinese new year.  The costumes appear to be, almost incredibly, detailed!

I own several Turandots, but I the vienna Marton, Carreras, Riccarelli is the most fruitful comparison.

Musically, Levine conducts a more restrained Turandot than Maazel.  He holds the orchestra back a bit more, more than likely due to the size of the Met.  But I have no complaints on this reading, it is a 5 star reading.

  Turandot is the Dramatic Soprano Eva Marton.  When choosing between this and the other option, consider that here her voice is more forced and squealing.  Her top is extrodinary to behold, a real force of nature.  Soimetimes the squelch is exciting, but it is not healthy.  He costume is much more impressive in this Met production, and she is dowright scary.

  Domingo plays Calaf.  He is, to me, surprizingly overwhelmed bythe orchestra.  This true from the end of act 1 until act 3.  When the orchestra turned up the heat, domingo was drowned out.  Now, Placido sand this role with the legendary Birgit Nillson in 1968, and he was heard just fine.  The difference here is the constant forcing.  He appears to be under great strain, (noting the 2nd act Crack at ""No, Gli Enigmi sono tre!""

His acting is intense and heroic, with much posturing and heroic arm gesturing.  It is clear that Domingo was a bit overtaxed by the tessitura of Calaf.  He does, however, excel whenever the Orchestra allows it.  The Vienna production features Jose Carreras, who, unfortunatley, has many of the same problems.  Although, If I were forced to choose Calaf, I would choose Carreras as Calaf.

  As Liu Leona Mitchel really shines.  Signore Ascolta is well sung, and she is a wonderful actress.  Paul Plishka, who these days can be seen as the Judge in Sweeney Todd, is a perfect Timur.

  Overall, this is the most Lavish production of Turandot, with the best costumes, the best Staging and the most overwhelming scale.  The Vienna production, available on video, is perhaps a touch more polished.",1098662400,18,2086,4.777464788732394
388068,4,6301880447,"Certainly I found this an enjoyable night's viewing, and rewatchable. The production is appropriately spectacular, the score frizzes with the excitement it should, and the principals parts are all taken by stars.
Leona Mitchell sings a wonderful Liu, shading her tone beautifully and floating the high notes as any worthwhile Liu should.
Eva Marton has a big voice that would have been great live but by 1988 had developed a judder in her voice that recording shows up glaringly. Her high notes sometimes squall - something hard to square with the idea of a sexually irresistable ice princess, whose top notes should be clear and, well, icy.
I found Domingo's Calaf is enjoyable enough but Chris' reservations are not without warrant. Paul Plishka makes a good Timur and Ping, Pang and Pong fuss about as they should.
All in all, a performance that I am happy to have, but would be grateful for a better one.

388069,3,6301880447,"Placido Domingo is undoubtadably a very fine singer, musician and actor. The sets are magnificant, and as a visual it is great. However, musically there are many flaws, and this has much to do with Domingo's difficulty with the role. He may have warmth and spinto in the tone to match the heroicism of the role, but he can't sing the high tessitura, making a mess of the top C at the end of In questa reggia, and producing very narrow tone in many of the other difficult notes in the score. His last A crowning Nessun Dorma is ordinary to say the least. Maybe my fellow reviewers are getting misled by some wonderfully meaningful hand and arm gestures, but what about the singing?
  The version from the Vienna state Opera, with Jose Carreras and Eva Marton from 1983, is from a period when Carreras could sing. His performance is everything that Domingo's isn't and most of all is technically secure (ie he can sing the role with  Nessun Dorma much more convincing with a slower tempo and much better legato). Eva Marton is also better in this production rarely producing squalling above the stave as she does in the Met production. Maazel and the VPO in the pit are also better in many aspects. If you can get a copy of this on VHS, it is the real definitive version of Turandot and hopefully someone will see the sense in releasing it on DVD soon.",1087430400,39,1350,4.479674796747967

Placido Domingo as Calaf and Eva Marton as Turandot are such super stars in singing as well in acting to be able to present the music into a divine and enchanting entirety. Also other singers like Mitchel as Liu matched the beautiful singing of the two above. The costumes and background sets was arranged in such elegant and rich designs which is as perfect and harmoniously matching to the place and contents of the story itself which make the entire opera a complete magnificent performance.

Therefore it casts only a little shadow to see him circumvent (or better circumsing) the high note at the end of the 2d act (""No, no, Principessa altera, Ti voglio tutta ardente d'amor"").
