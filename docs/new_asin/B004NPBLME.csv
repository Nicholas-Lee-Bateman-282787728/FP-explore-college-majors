8436769,5,B004NPBLME,Good movie illustrating the dangers of pelagianism and the way in which Finneys altar call conversion doctrine (first time ever taught in history) has led to an exponential rise of falsely assured professors in the church.,1442620800,3,222,5.194444444444445
8436770,1,B004NPBLME,"This has got to be one of the worst documentary movies ever made in the history of film.  Poor filmography.  Not at all objective.  Quotes from the subject were either exaggerated or taken out of context.  If the presenters had to argue their case in court, they would lose.  If you want to see religious bias at its apex, watch this film.  Otherwise, don't waste your $2.99.  I think these people should use their energy to spread the gospel instead of character assassination of a person who has been dead for over 100 years.  I'm sure that since they approach the film from an ultra-reform perspective, that any historical figure who approached conversion from an experiential or somewhat Arminian viewpoint would be labelled as a heretic by this film company.  I wish I would have watched something a little more objective, like the terminator.",1430179200,3,848,4.833333333333333
8436771,1,B004NPBLME,"Very sad, If only Calvinists showed the love and grace they espouse. Dr Michael Brown shows more class that anyone connected to this pride laced Christian bashing waste of time. Too bad they did not spend the effort, time, and money promoting the gospel of Jesus Christ instead. I pray they realize and repent one day.  How un-edifying and hateful this really is. Surely not of the true Spirit of our Living Holy God.",1368489600,6,417,4.635135135135135
8436772,1,B004NPBLME,"From what I can see this is just more in-house fighting, one Calvinist against another. In fact, I find that Calvinism is pretty much one academic head butting heads with another. That in a nutshell is the history of Calvinism. Always an argument, always a debate, always one ego against the other, always about themselves, never about Christ. Just like their founder ""The Geneva Pope"" John Calvin, all they can do is burn one another at the stake (albeit, in this case verbal not literal). Now we have a Calvinist pronouncing that Finney is burning in Hell. Yet history records that Finney led more people to Christ than the author ever will in 10 lifetimes. Calvinists hate everyone including other Calvinists because, you see, they have 5 points to wrangle over, so the 2 pointers lash out at the 3 pointers while the 5 pointers curse the 4 pointers, while most Calvinists today are just 1pointers and they all think they are doing God's work. This is why Calvinism is such an empty voice. Calvinists hate the Wesley's (whom God used to save England from a revolution and ushered in a massive revival), they hate Whitfield who was a Calvinist because... well, nobody really knows why except that Calvinists just hate. They hate Spurgeon who was a Calvinist because most of his sermons have a Wesleyan bent to them (Spurgeon believed in obedience, Calvinists don't need too since God hand-picked them to be His eternal darlings while the rest of the world burns in Hell). Calvinism: no wonder Wesley called it the ""damnable heresy."" Forget this item on Finney and get a book titled: ""Life in the Son"" by Robert Shank (A Baptist for those of you who fear to read anything that isn't Calvin approved). Then follow it up with ""Elect in the Son."" Of course there is always Dave Hunts book: ""What Love Is This."" In the end a Calvinist couldn't read these books, because most Calvinists are not trusting Christ for their salvation, they are trusting their doctrine handed to them by a man who had people murdered. It's too frightening for them to step out of the fold.",1335571200,10,2064,4.704419889502763
8436773,1,B004NPBLME,"The claim is false and even ridiculous on the face of it. In fact, the Rev. Charles G. Finney was actually TRIED on charges of heresy by the Presbyterian Church in his own day. And, when they had to listen carefully to his views, he was acquitted. Not guilty! So the script writer supposedly knows more at this distance than Finney's opposers and questioners who dealt with him face to face. Further, the period of history during which he taught and preached is now known as the Second Great Awakening! At least half a million persons were saved. And these were not nominal professions of faith, but active believers who improved society. Finney's teaching are, thankfully, now available to examine more carefully in theses basic works: The Autobiography of Charles Finney, Revival Lectures (or, Lectures on Revivals of Religion), and his Systematic Theology. For those who wish to delve further, many more of his works are viewable at [...]. Go ahead and view this film, but make sure to read Finney for yourself - many of his works are available as Kindle downloads immediately.",1333238400,11,1080,4.875
8436774,5,B004NPBLME,Our church watched this video for our Wednesday night study.  All we can say is it was excellent.  I have ordered six copies to give away to friends and family.  I just read the review of the other guy on this site and wonder if he watched the same video. He seems to be a hateful man with an axe to grind.  I feel sorry for him.,1309219200,7,329,3.8656716417910446
8436775,1,B004NPBLME,"First, it's important to note that this video is made by a producer who spun off from Eric Homberg's Reel to Real Ministries / The Apologetics Group. A few years back Jerry Johnson split from this corporation, but still calls his organization ApologeticsGroup.com because he was able to get control of the Internet URL address. Eric Holmberg is the founder and president of The Apologetics Group and is best known for producing over 30 video presentations since 1987, some of which are highly acclaimed. Two of the best known are Hells Bells and Amazing Grace: The History and Theology of Calvinism. Because I am currently part of R2R / The Apologetics Group and have known and worked alongside of Eric Holmberg on and off since 1989, I wanted to make it clear that Jerry Johnson is not the same ""Apologetics Group"" as Eric Holmberg's organization. From what I have seen, two subsequent DVD presentations produced by Jerry Johnson in the past four years are not the same caliber and spirit as those produced by Eric Holmberg and The Apologetics Group.

Second, it also might help potential buyers to listen to an interesting interview by Revival historian and theologian, Dr. Michael Brown with Jerry Johnson. The interview summarizes and critiques the 60-minute video in a half hour radio program.  In short, Jerry Johnson claims that Charles Finney was a false prophet and goes as far as to say that Finney is in hell now. Dr. Brown states in the interview that although he disagrees with Finney's moral government theology, that the 19th century revivalist was used powerfully of God to reach souls and lead many to a deep conviction of sin and resulting repentance in an age when many preachers had become apathetic and lackadaisical in their preaching and evangelistic efforts. He also points out that Finney never set out to deceive people or gain selfishly from his preaching. Finney's own journals attest to the sacrificial lifestyle he led in order to win the lost to Christ.

I first became aware of Charles Finney through the ministries of Keith Green, Leonard Ravenhill and David Wilkerson. For a time, Wilkerson's church in Times Square was even named after Finney's 19th century church, The Broadway Tabernacle. Finney became a huge inspiration to 20th century revivalists who used some of Finney's methods and sermon outlines in an attempt to exemplify the preaching fervor the 19th century Second Great Awakening. I became a big an of Finney and especially liked his Lectures on Revival and his Memoirs. However, I never attempted to read his Systematic Theology until years later

But what did Finney really preach? Was he really the heretic from hell that Jerry Johnson portrays? To understand Finney, one must first understand the difference between the ""New School"" Calvinism of Jonathan Edwards' followers and the classical Calvinism brought to America by the Puritans, Presbyterians and a other Reformed denominations. By the late 1700s, preachers who were influenced by the First Great Awakening tried to employ the measures that they thought would result in the same revival fires that had transformed America two generations prior to their evangelistic efforts. One such preacher was Jonathan Edwards' grandson, Timothy Dwight, who presided over four or five revivals as the president of Yale College. Essentially, what the ""New Lights"" - as they were called - did was to confront Enlightenment humanism, Unitarianism, Deism, Universalism and Arminianism, which they saw as a threat to their Christian faith. However, in doing so, they employed many of the philosophical constructs of Enlightenment philosophers, such as John Locke and also flirted seriously with the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation thought called Moral Government Theology. Thus they ended up with a sort of a synthesis of two strains of Protestant thought that were popular after the 1600s - one that used the terms of contemporary philosophy in defense of a New School Calvinism.

The New Lights also began to employ a series of techniques in their evangelistic meetings known as the ""New Measures."" These included, for instance, a mourner's bench, which can be seen as a forerunner to the modern ""altar call."" These techniques were not used by earlier preachers such as Jonathan Edwards --even when he would call sinners to repentance in sermons such as ""Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God."" It is little understood by modern evangelicals that Edwards thought that only those that were already born-again could repent and believe. He did not reverse the order of salvation as many moderns do and call sinners to change their own hearts first, prior to regeneration. Calvinists have correctly have understood that conversion is a three-fold process in which regeneration causes repentance and faith. One cannot be had without the others, but repenting and believing cannot cause us to be born-again. Arminians and all other Christians reverse the order of salvation and say that repentance comes first, but all agree that one aspect of conversion cannot be had without the others. This reversal has led many Arminians to talk about a true and false repentance and a true and false conversion in describing those who are swept up into the harvest of evangelism, but make no lasting commitment to Christ.

Of course, repentance cannot be ""false repentance"" if it truly proceeds from spiritual regeneration. But in reversing the order of salvation, Arminians had to explain how it seemed that some repented, but in the end were not really converted and saved. Obviously this was due to a different definition of repentance. One focuses on individual acts of sins, but the true definition of repentance is a total change of the mind and heart attitude toward sin that results from a renewed spiritual nature in which sin nature is put away through regeneration. The Calvinist understands that repentance is the continual putting away of sin after we are converted. We will repent because our nature is turned away from sin and toward holiness. On the other hand, one extreme end of Arminianism sees a false conversion if individual acts of sin still remain in the professing believer. A relentlessly logical mind such as Finney's would then consider sinless perfection - at least eventually - to be the mark of a true convert.

Although Finney saw himself as following in the footsteps of the Calvinist preacher Jonathan Edwards, he took the New Light theology a step further. Finney fully embraced Moral Government Theology as the foundation to his Systematic Theology and added some extreme elements of Wesleyan Arminian moral perfectionism - the teaching that Christians may become sinless in thought, word and deed.

In Finney's day, his Systematic Theology book publication was met with opposition by some well-known Calvinists such as R.L. Dabney, Charles Hodge, Ashael Nettleton and B.B. Warfield. However, it is also worth noting that almost without exception each of the men who published against Finney were also avowed racists who defended slavery and hated Finney's abolitionist efforts. I believe that this led them to exaggerate the positions of Finney - which were commonly held by many - and label him as a Socinian, a Pelagian and a host of other heresies. Finney wrote a rebuttal to these critiques in a later edition of Systematic Theology. He absolutely denied these charges, writing that he understood what these heresies taught and repudiated them. Finney countered that his critics hadn't understood him correctly. The problem in understanding the debate over Finny today is that his Systematic Theology is a cumbersome read and most will not be able to sustain enough interest to get through it. Many instead rely on these earlier assessments by Finney's critics. Jerry Johnson claims to have researched Finney for a period of a few years going as far as to track down some rare and out-of-print volumes. However, I have to ask why - if Finney repudiated the heresies imputed to him by Hodge and company - we should not take him at his word.

While I admire Finney for his accomplishments especially in his attempt to eradicate slavery and even seeing that the first black woman in America to graduate from college when he was president of Oberlin College, I reject his eclectic approach toward the theology of salvation. However, I disagree with Jerry Johnson both in his arrogant demeanor and fallacious arguments he makes in debate with Dr. Brown. Being a committed Calvinist, Johnson makes Calvinism the standard of orthodoxy. Of course, there is nothing wrong with that. I agree with the theology of Calvinism and I am a member of a Reformed church. However, I am often troubled by the condescending attitude that Calvinists have toward non-Reformed evangelicals who work tirelessly in evangelism. If someone is not a Calvinist, they are not orthodox. I have seen this attitude many times in Jerry Johnson. According to his view, Roman Catholics are not saved. Charismatics are named as false prophets. Numerous evangelicals are labeled as heretics. A condescending and austere attitude is taken with anyone who has not attained his level of understanding. And while Jerry Johnson treats Dr. Brown with a superficially pretentious tone of respect in the interview, he privately mocks anyone who does not fall into his theological stream of thought.

I receive frequent e-mails from Calvinists who believe that to move away from Calvinism even slightly is to deny the Gospel. As one blogger recently put it: ""In their minds, Paul preached the gospel, Catholics distorted the gospel, Luther and Calvin restored the gospel, Arminians ruined the gospel, and the Synod of Dort endorsed the pure gospel once again. Calvinism then, through TULIP, judges all things.""

Dr. Brown correctly points out that Christians are not followers of Calvin, Arminius, or any creed or confession. We are followers of Jesus Christ. While Reformed theology and its comprehensive creeds and confessions have great value and are sadly ignored by many, they are not the litmus test for saving faith. We can use them as a standard of orthodoxy and to judge what we call ""Christian,"" but we cannot use them to determine with all certainty who specifically is saved. Jesus Christ and the Word of God judges us. So while I encourage the listening laity to study theology for themselves and pick up the fat books written by a bunch of dead guys and avoid the popular trash that is churned out by the evangelical pulp mills, I cannot recommend this video by Jerry Johnson. I agree with Jerry Johnson in his conclusion that Finney is not the path to sound theology and especially soteriology. However, his presumption to know the hidden counsel of God and know for certain that if Charles Finney held the beliefs imputed to him by his critics, then ""he is in hell now"" is absurd and offensive. To endorse such a video with a rating of higher than one star would be to endorse a brand of Pharisaism that I find repugnant and in fact heretical in and of its own exclusionary nature.",1308700800,34,11071,5.040961223375205
