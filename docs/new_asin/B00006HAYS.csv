1757015,1,B00006HAYS,"Well, gather round this here campfire, shoppers an' horror movie lovers, an' let me tell you a cautionary tale thet might keep y'all from havin' to sit through this pitcher like this here reviewer did! Y'see, this ole reviwer's always had a thang fer them horror-anthology pitchers thet tell several tales in one. Since some of'er fav'rite horror films are Creepshow, Tales from the Hood, Tales from the Darkside, Twilight Zone the Movie and the likes, she thought she might enjoy watchin' this pitcher. Why, she even sawr a reel scerry one called Campfire TALES, not t'be kinfused with this sorry excuse fer a pitcher, thet scered her so bad she made her husband come inter th' room to hold her hand!
Now see, yer reviwer was fooled by the credit sequence, which showed a comic book come to life, and a talkin' skull warnin' ya about the movie yer about to watch. Why, it even had that neat Creepshow-lookin' font! She thought that looked real cool and gots kinda excited, cause she figgered there was no way anyone could screw up a pitcher thet opened like that.
 Well, turns out yer ole reviewer was wrong! Fans o' that Jamie-Lynn Sigler from that citified HBO drama the Sopranos, should be warned that she only appears in the pitcher's inept framin' device. This here framin' device has her and two young fellers stranded in the woods waitin' fer a tow truck, when who should they run into but a feller that looks a lot like thet David Johansen of the New York Dolls, playin' a crazy character name o' Ranger Bill! Fer some reason, even though the pitcher advertised that it was filmed on location in New Jersey, this here Ranger Bill talks like an old prospecter from a bad Western, kinda like I am right now. I guess them fellers that made the movie thought it was a mite scarier than a Brooklyn accent. Anyway, he proceeds to tell the young fellers three campfire stories.
Now this here revirewer is a mite confused, because she always figgered that campfire stories were supposed to be scary. The tired, predictible-like stories are about, first, a killer in the woods, featuring a real unnecessary-like prologue, second, about some mean young'uns who kill a Native American Medicine man fer no apperent reason, then start smoking some o' his wacky tobaccy and hallucinatin' some o' those fancified CGI critter effects, only not very good ones .In all fairness I gots to admit thet middle story wasn't quite as predictible, but it shore was borin'! But don't git yer hopes up. There's a third story that's just as tired an' predictable as the others concernin' two couples in a supposedly haunted house bein' stalked by a killer with a camcorder. Evidently that there killer straps the camcorder to his haid when he murders people, since he films his victims while killin' im with both hands! Also, fer some reason, at the end of the framin' device, (the predictible endin' o which is given away anyway in the trailer, which by th' way is the only DVD extra), that there band the Misfits show up! This ole reviewer wondered if any o' this was supposed to make her feel a mite scared, cause by this time she was a-strugglin' to keep awake. By the way, there ain't much gore in this pitcher, in fact, them MPAA varmints coulda rated th' thing PG.
Yer ole reviewer was also feelin' a mite sorry fer the likes of The Misfits, David Johansson, and thet Sopranos chick by the time this dadblamed pitcher was over. Durin' the end credits, we get to see thet Ranger Bill sayin' things to the camera like, ""Have you kissed a Ranger today?"" intercut with some comic book pages, which turned out to be th' only mildly interestin' thing in the cornsarn flick!
Anyway, this here reviewer thought she'd better gather y'all consumers an' moviegoers alike round the fire an' warn ya not to rent, buy, or sit through this sorry excuse for a horror pitcher, so y'all don't hafta suffer the same terrible fate!

1757016,3,B00006HAYS,"I wouldn't call this the greatest B movie ever made, but it does have it's moments.  Such as [low-budget] effects and bad acting.  The stories told aren't that bad, with a bigger budget the movie could have given us horror fans justice.  But it's based off of the comic book by the same name so it's just a little tribute.  the best part of the movie is a cameo the the greatest punk band ever The MISFITS!  If you liked the Tales From The Crypt, Creepshow 1 or 2, or Tales From The Darkside check it out.  Or in my case bad B-movies, I dug it.",1030924800,5,544,4.084905660377358
1757017,4,B00006HAYS,"Campfire stories is a B rated horror flick that delivers on pure entertainment value.  It is set with the typical story of three teens, lost in the woods after their car gets a flat, who come upon a crazy looking guy in a boy scout uniform.  The overgrown boy scout proceeds to tell the teens three scary stories around the campfire, ostensibly while waiting for a tow truck.  Each of the three scary stories become small movies within the movie.  Very Tales From the Crypt in style.  Of course, the movie ends with them dead.
While I can't consider this great horror or very thrilling, it delivers on all the necessary points to be graded as an excellent Bgrade flick.  There's enough entertainment value to justify a few watchings if you are willing to suspend disbelief and your higher sensibilities.  Much like a Jello No-Bake cheesecake, you can enjoy it if you just accept it on it's own terms and stop trying to convince yourself that it's something other than what it is.",1029974400,,979,4.624277456647399
1757078,5,B00006HAYS,"My roommates and I rented this movie in college, thinking it would be scary.  It was so awful that we were in hysterics for pretty much the whole movie.  I think we had to pause it so that we could calm down from laughing.  If Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still around(sniff...I miss that show), this would be the PERFECT movie for them to watch. Rent (or buy, the cheapest copy is 29 cents!) this movie if you want to be entertained by just how bad a movie can be.",1174521600,,469,4.188888888888889
1757079,1,B00006HAYS,"This ranks down there with the worst of the straight-to-video horror movies of recent years.  The acting is sub-par, the ""campfire stories"" are dull and predicatable, and the myriad video camera angles and technqiues border on the nauseating at times (oh, not to mention the worst CGI you'll see this year in the ""Indian"" story).  It's such a waste of time, that there is really nothing at all ever remotely interesting enough to make a comment like ""worth seeing for a laugh"" or the usual...  Just skip it - save your time and money. (yes - it is one of THOSE movies, sorry to say).

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125792000,3,837,4.415584415584416
1757080,1,B00006HAYS,"this movie is not even worth renting, trust me. the entire crew of this movie put so little effort into all aspects of production that it is completly unwatchable. The plots are simple and childish(essentialy poorly acted and directed ""Are you afraid of the dark?"" sequences.",1095033600,,275,5.0
1757081,1,B00006HAYS,"Ok... so if you want the ""plot"" of this movie read some of the other reviews.
If you want to know how much it sucked then read this one. I think all the other reviewers were really too generous in their praise for this film. One of the reviews says watch this movie if you are bored. DONT it will increase your boredom. The stories are rediculous and badly acted [not in that great b-horror shlock kind of way either...if you want that then get killer Klowns from outerspace].
I'm not a buff by any means, but I do love horror, all kinds of horror, good bad, great, gory... you name it. But this movie is none of that...it's just boring and disapointing.
Don't buy this movie. Please. If you must then rent it.. then write a review like mine and tell everyone how bad it was.",1071532800,,775,4.27891156462585
1757082,3,B00006HAYS,"Hmmm, what to say. First, there's this skull that talks for like fifteen minutes. The movie starts out with these two dorks with a flat tire, and this chick in a skirt flags them on the side of a dirt road. After a little bantering, the chick leads the dorks into the woods to a campfire where that Buster Poindexter guy is sitting. I'm not sure what circumstances there are in which Buster Poindexter could be seen as frightening, but, none the less, he tells everybody to sit down and listen to three poorly-shot, badly written, disjointed tales of horror:
The first story is about a pack of high school football creeps trying to bully the janitor---who just happens to be an escaped mental patient. I think my little sister could take any of these football players in a fight---one at a time or simultaneously. It's really easy to hate and ridicule them. They chase the janitor into the woods, he ends of stalking and killing all but one of them, then the last one, the ring leader, gets pinned down to a chair and ostensibly butchered. This is the kind of crap that wouldn't even make the cut for an episode of Tales From The Darkside.
The second story is the worst, involving three lowlife creeps that like to hang around and roll the old folks. They set their sights on an old Indian, follow him to his place out in the woods. Then they kill him, steal his magic weed and begin smoking it. They have really lame Ronny James Dio type hallucinations, and then, they begin turning old, realizing that the magic weed sucked their life force and put it into the Indian. Blah blah blah. I know it's that literary device where, in the interest of justice, God assumes the form of a greater evil to consume the lesser one. It's cool when it's done correctly, but in this case it was just kind of flaccid.
The last story was really no better than the other two, but it had two fine chicks, a blonde and a brunette, trying to play some kind of high school ""get even"" prank on their sissy mary boyfriends. It's cool because the chicks get into these leather skirts, but the whole thing really goes nowhere, as the brunette's ghost grandmother starts a miniature killing spree. Mainly just watch this one for the chicks---try to tune everything else out.
Anyway, at the end of the stories, the two dorks and the chick from the beginning get a tow truck, and idiotically enough they find this bar out in the middle of rustic nowhere where's there's some kind of half-baked Misfits cover band on stage. And then you find out they were all in cahoots together, Buster Poindexter, the janitor, the Indian with the evil weed, and the brunette in the leather skirt. Oh boyohboy. I don't know, just watch this if you're bored and in the mood for a bad movie, but don't expect alot. It's not like we're talking Pieces or Burial Ground ""The Nights of Terror"".",1068681600,6,2844,4.502901353965184
1757083,4,B00006HAYS,"others here have told of bad acting, i didn't find it all that terrible, i've certainly seen much worse
i thought there are many parts that are lame, but i don't think the film set out to be the most terrifying thing either, so given that, it does pretty well
like many other movies like this, it has about 4 different short stories that are strung together through the the storytelling of a park ranger
i found each of the stories a little bit too simple and easy to give them much credit in originality, but they at least held my intrest long enough, all in all i'd say worth watching and worth renting if you are looking to watch some campy scary stories, especially if there are youngsters with you, as the stories are not too scary",1067212800,5,736,4.340579710144928
1757084,3,B00006HAYS,"Heck, it even has its moments when it borders on being good! ""Campfire Stories"" (not to be confused with the superior ""Campfire Tales"") is a new horror anthology that begs to be rented at the very least. The opening could put a jolt through some people, if they`re watching it alone and in the dark, featuring a creepy talking skull introducing the movie you are about to view, but he stays on the screen too long and just becomes stupid. Actually, the only reason the thing is scary to begin with is because it makes you feel like you're about to watch one of those Traces of Death videos everyone talked about with such high respect in grade school. The story he takes you into is that of two young men driving down a deserted road and stopping suddenly at the sight of a young, female traveler (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) standing in their path who also claims to have had car trouble (though her car is nowhere to be seen). The travelers decide to team up and look for help by, of course, wandering into the woods, and this is where they encounter a very unsettling David Johansen playing an oddball character called ""Ranger Bill."" Ranger Bill is clearly a freak. He instructs the kids to have a seat around a campfire and listen to his stories while they wait for the tow truck to arrive.

The Ranger's first story is about a campus bully who picks on the wrong school groundskeeper. The creepy guy is actually an escaped mental patient who learned a lot about the art of inflicting pain from his even crazier doctor back before he ""checked out."" After the tedious flashback intro where we see the mental patient being tortured by his doctor until finally escaping, the story begins interestingly enough with the antics of the mean-spirited football players, led by the bully quarterback, causing a stir on the campus lawn and making us think maybe, despite the horrible acting, this might get interesting. Unfortunately, it really doesn't, as the rest of the story consists of the football players running through the forest trying to find the groundskeeper while he is slowly picking them off one by one. That's pretty much all of that story. No real clincher to it. I suppose the end scene in the psychotic groundskeeper's lair is supposed to be shocking, but it really isn't.

At this point I should mention that, since Ranger Bill IS narrating the stories, his voice does come in now and then and pretty much ruin any scariness that might be on the verge of being felt by the viewer. His fake backwoods accent makes it sound like you're watching an old Disney nature story every time his voice interrupts with a comment, usually spewing out something that makes absolutely no sense.

The second story is a tad more creative. Unfortunately, it drags on in the drug-use sequences. The story opens in an old diner in which it seems only the elderly come to eat, except at one table occupied by three hoodlums; two male, one female. Then, in walks an elderly Native-American man. When he leaves, the hoodlums follow, and when they find him sitting outside his trailer smoking something funny, they are dying to take part. The three set out to murder the old man, and they do so, and spend the rest of the night smoking his pipe and hanging out in his trailer. But, when the trip starts to go bad and the CGI snakes start swirling around, it's all downhill from there. The next day, we find our three hoodlums tragically altered by the bad medicine.

Finally, the last story comes around, and this one is pretty good. Okay, maybe it's just another ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" rip-off, but I thought it was pretty creative, and it keeps you guessing throughout. The story involves a young girl living in an old house her grandmother left to her, with her very cute, but very unstable roommate. The two have been having some guy troubles and decide to turn the tables on their mischievous boyfriends. Their plan is to humiliate the boys on camera and then post the video on the internet, as they suspected the boys were planning to do to them. But, there are a lot of bad vibes flowing through the old house, and someone is up to more than public humiliation. Trying to figure out who's the real baddie isn't as easy as it seems, even if it probably should have been obvious from the start.

Now, we come to the end of the movie. Ranger Bill has told his stories, and the Tow truck is ready to go. But, of course, this film isn't going to end on a happy note, so someone in the group of weary and frightened travelers is probably not going to make it home alive.

Overall, this movie is bad, no doubt, but it CAN be fun to watch, especially with a group of friends. The acting is bad, of course, and the writing too, though I gotta say that the last story I thought was pretty okay. And, then there's the wraparound story, which I thought had a good little ending to it. No, there's nothing much in this movie that's scary, unless the punk band ""The Misfits"" freaks you out, but it's still good, sick fun. The only DVD extra is the trailer though, and you'd probably be better off not watching it until after seeing the movie.",1042934400,14,5139,4.520430107526882

1757086,3,B00006HAYS,"some friends and i rented this one weekend thinking it would be  a nice scary movie. well there is not a single moment in the film where you are even slightly frightened except for the point where your brain tries to gnaw its way out of your skull from the painful lameness.and even that fright is quick to pass. there is, however, one quote in this movie that is funny enough to justify the time you spent watching it. it is simply this: ""just when you think you've got life by the balls, you  kill an indian, and then he steals your soul"". do not ask me what it means i couldn't tell you but its wisdom has helped me through some tough times. on a side note i think the guys at mystery science theatre could help this one out a bit.",1035504000,2,734,4.125874125874126

7968702,2,B00006HAYS,"After a mild berating from a poorly computerized skull, CAMPFIRE STORIES kicks off its trio of terrors with a wrap=around story involving three teens that are stranded in the forest. The kooky Ranger Bill invites them to sit by the fire and enjoy some campfire tales while they wait for their tow truck. In the first story, an insane criminal makes a bloody escape from prison, only to end up the tormented janitor at a local high school twenty years later. It isn't long before he gets revenge on his teen assailants using a variety of gardening accessories! Next up, three teens face an ancient Native American curse after killing an Indian shaman in an attempted robbery. Lastly, four young lovers are targeted by a voyeuristic killer during their drunken party games. Each of the campfire stories are unremarkable in every way possible, barely getting by with its passable acting and filmed on what looks like a hand-held digicam. The only thing that makes it worth watching is for the early performances by television stars Jamie-Lynn Sigler (The Sopranos), John Hensley (Nip/Tuck), Charlie Day and Rob McElhenney (It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia), and pop culture Blogger Perez Hilton. This is otherwise a tired and empty omnibus collection riding on the popularity of late-90's Teen Slashers like I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and URBAN LEGEND.
