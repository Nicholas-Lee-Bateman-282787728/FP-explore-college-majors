2452991,4,B000C65Z9S,"""Assisted Living"" is a grey film--a film without definition, without the comfort of a border between black and white. First, it's a fictionalized documentary, and that shading is important to the meaning the film has for us.  Watching it, we'd like some resolution, some plot, some gripping and overwhelming message.  But there is none of this.  The film slides between a mother's passion and and senile boredom, between love's tragedy and a human comedy, between a drugged haze and a clear reality, and between the hard facts of old age care and the casual fiction of a screen play. And throughout it all are the hands--old, gnarled, veined, like dark birds.

""Assisted Living"" is a beautiful film. It's not easy to watch, and it isn't meant to be.  It casts an ominous shadow which hangs

over the heart long after the film ends.",1140134400,6,831,4.776223776223776
2452992,5,B000C65Z9S,I didn't think I was going to like this movie when I first started watching it.  Personally I think they could have taken the drug use out of this movie and it would have been a much better movie.  I am a guy who works in a nursing home. I have for almost 20 years now in different capacities.  Other then the drug use I was the main character at one point or another.  Still am to a degree despite the fact that I don't do much patient care anymore.  This movie really brings out the truth of being a resident in a nursing home or assisted living facility.  These residents really are our treasured past.  But most of the time they are tossed into nursing homes as if they were useless trash.  These people should be respected.  The residents that are in nursing homes today are who made this country what it is today.  It was on their backs that the United States became the great country it is today.  This movie reminded me so much of where I work it was scary.  The movie was filmed in a real assisted living /Nursing home.  One note if you haven't worked in a facility you probably won't appreciate this movie like I did.  My wife didn't really care for it for this reason other then feel depressed after seeing it.  It takes a special person to work in this environment every day.  I guess I am one of those people.,1137110400,6,1322,4.228

8095779,2,B000C65Z9S,"I am not, as a rule, a fan of docudramas, and the description of this film leads one to believe that it's a more of a dramedy.  Not the case.  Anyone with a camcorder visiting a nursing home anywhere in the country could come up with this film.  Two stars only because the two ""leads"" managed to pull off some decent acting.",1439683200,,324,4.193548387096774

8095784,4,B000C65Z9S,"I watched ASSISTED LIVING with my ALS patient in a nursing home exactly like the ""home"" protrayed in this excellent movie. What struck me, beyond the obvious relationship that Todd struck up with the elderly Mrs. Pearlman, and her innate pathos (and the lack of real caring by the nurse at the nurses station) is the following:

No matter how fancy we may make such places, with lovely sitting rooms and big screen TVs, organized games, elegant dining rooms and beautician services, no one is being fooled. Some residents realize with despair that they are in effect locked up in a gilded cage. Escape seems to be a subtext of the film.

The head of the movie nursing home secretly drank in his office to try to escape the inherent horror and fear we may all have at some level of growing debilitated as we age, and ending up in an ""assisted living"" situation. In one scene, an aging golden retriever (owned by an elderly resident) could not take it anymore, and was whining and scratching at an EXIT door. While not an ultimately compassionate act (the dog would probably end up in a pound), Todd let the dog go. The dog ran across the distant fields at top rate, until it disappeared in the distance.

To me, this symbolized the soul of each person in the nursing home at some level, the nursing staff, the management, and the residents, all who really wanted to be free.

Ironically, I (as a hospice volunteer) was watching this with a paralyzed young man of 42 who has been ""filed"" in such a place. He urged me to view the movie with him via his PC. He was deeply moved, and wanted to share his feelings with me via the movie.

Now, I have a question for anyone who has seen this movie and can comment here. I watched this movie in a very noisy environment, and was left with some confusion: Did Mrs. Pearlman actually have a son in Australia, or was all of that a delusion of her mind? Was her assertion that she was only going to be in the nursing home a short time before being picked up by her son and taken to Australia a total delusion, since there was no son? (Note that the nurse at the station had no one listed as a contact e for Mrs. Pearlman. So was she fighting the horror of realizing that she was totally alone in the world and would die in this place, perhaps no longer remembering who she was?).",1212278400,,2316,4.364269141531323
8095785,5,B000C65Z9S,"I thought this was an excellent film.  This was a truly beautiful depiction of the character Todd.  We meet a very realistic person who struggles with continually escaping his own emotional needs and self.  Meanwhile, he generously provides validation to the needs of the elderly residents.  It seems he is tireless with some of these adult children.  He exibits true empathy in a way that I have not seen captured in film.  What is entirely touching is how the elderly woman, that he befriends, exhibits an attachment to him that appears to really affect him and even fill a hole.  This film depicts the ugly side of human desparation and emotional flaws-- all the while in such beautiful light.  This film made me feel closer to humanity.  --- oh, and as a side note, I didn't think that the ""jokes"" were done in effort to hurt the elderly residents at all.  Instead, I thought the jokes were really methods to add spice and hope to the resident's dull, routine reminents of life.",1197072000,,982,4.656976744186046
8095786,2,B000C65Z9S,"A janitor works in a assistant care living center and amuses himself with harmless phone calls that perhaps makes the old people happy. Or at least it seems nobody is getting hurt. He develops compassion for an old woman who knows Alzheimer's is taking her mind. He tries to placate her with a fake call from her son but it makes things worse.

I failed to see the comedy in this movie. I thought the technique of shooting in a real care center interesting and gave the film a feel of authenticity. The part fiction/part docudrama was poorly executed and just didn't mesh well. I was glad it was only 72 minutes. It was getting long at 50 minutes.",1155427200,,647,4.436974789915967
8095787,4,B000C65Z9S,"Wow!  I have been taking care of my aunt who has Alzheimers and my mom who has dementia for the past year (which seems like a lifetime).  They are now residents of a nursing home, and this film is must-see viewing for those who are caregivers.  Ya gotta laugh or you'd cry.  The world of ""Assisted Living"" is a bizarro world where what you think is right in the ""real"" world no longer works--and the film accurately portrays that.  A true heart (which Todd acquires) and a creative, loving imagination are what real-life assisted living requires of both its clients and their caregivers.  And this film has those qualities.",1151712000,,623,4.669724770642202
