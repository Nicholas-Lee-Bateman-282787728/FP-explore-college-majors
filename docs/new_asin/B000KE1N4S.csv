It's interesting from page one, and you wonder at such an odd family - none of whom are alike, and not liking one another all that much. It has drama, suspense, love stories, and some very interesting descriptions of monks - and their lives - because the youngest son becomes a monk. I haven't finished the book yet, so don't know if it ends well - but so far, excellent!!",1377561600,,459,4.476190476190476
8155756,5,B000KE1N4S,"I saw this movie decades ago when it was first released and loved it.  I saw it again in the last ten years and it was just as good on every level.  It is a great story, full of every kind of human interaction: philosophy, romance, intrigue, and mystery.

The actors are top-notch; the photography and sets are excellent.  I am about to buy a copy so I can see it again and show it to my grandchildren.  Jean",1325030400,,408,4.113924050632911
8155757,3,B000KE1N4S,"I found this movie to be uninteresting, as I'm not ""steeped"" in the particular setting.  I began viewing, then about half finished, I quit....and then REWOUND, of course...tee-hee!",1230249600,,180,5.428571428571429
