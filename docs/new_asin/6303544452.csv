687310,4,6303544452,"Weird and wonderful.  I caught a but of it on TV but didn't see it offered again.  It's a bit B but compelling.,",1252540800,,112,3.8260869565217392
687311,5,6303544452,I first saw this movie in a sci-fi class during college and loved it.  Sad that it wasn't picked up by the TV studios.  I would love to see/buy it again but it only seems available in VHS.  Hoping that a DVD version might be released soon?,1194739200,15,239,4.042553191489362
687312,4,6303544452,"I saw this originally back when it first played on tv. It was so good that I couldn't forget it and eventually had to find a copy for myself. The characters are rich and the story is fresh and unlike any other I have ever seen or read about. It's not in print, but if you can find a copy, you are not wasting your money to buy it.",1190332800,7,330,3.7971014492753623
687313,5,6303544452,I loved this movie when it was broadcasted and I can't wait till it is released on DVD!  A must have!,1053993600,11,101,3.8095238095238093
687314,5,6303544452,"This fantastic fantasy story is stunning in both the visual effects as well as its' written script! Paul Winfield gives a great performance as "" The Local Country Doctor"" on a bipolar planet, half in eternal light and half in eternal dark! Both sides demanding His services and all the while training a new intern, newly landed on the planet to at first cultivate stories from far afield in the savage frontier of space, only to be taken in by the beauty and lore of this world! A film not to be missed by any fan of science fiction!!!!",1018396800,35,536,4.424242424242424
7851153,4,6303544452,"A great cult classic.  Cast and directorship top notch.  (Francis Ford Coppola)  However...very strange movie indeed. Under all the weirdness, it is a story that could happen anywhere.  A young intern is sent to a remote place to do his internship and as a city boy, laughs at the rustic country folk, at first. As he begins to grasp the reality of other peoples' lives, some in his hands, he is finally disarmed.  In service to others, he finds the antidote for his own pain.  Spoiler alert...soupy ending.",1466035200,,507,4.704545454545454
7851154,4,6303544452,"I only saw this once, when it originally ran on TV, but keep hoping it will be released on DVD, since I'd really like to see it again, and share it with some people. I'm intrigued that none of the reviews mentions the stunning similarity to the the Kurosawa film, Red Beard.",1451260800,,274,4.288461538461538
7851155,5,6303544452,"This is probably one of the best science fiction movies out there - and it was a made-for-television movie. The story is so different and has points that you desperately want developed more, but my guess it was filmed as a potential series and never picked up.  That being said, you will always remember this film, it's visual impact and creativity stays with you. Another reviewer used the term ""haunting"" - very accurate.

Anyone new to the film will be amazed at its cast and special effects (way before CGI, thank you).  That it is only currently available on VHS breaks my heart!  Someone find me a remastered DVD!",1436140800,2,619,4.651376146788991
7851156,5,6303544452,Perfect exactly what I ordered,1426032000,,30,5.2
7851157,5,6303544452,"White Dwarf is Sci-Fi At Its Very Best! I don't know why in the world this film is so obscure, It shouldn't be! It has humor and it is also very intense. Paul Winfield plays his role brilliantly! The story is imaginative. The special effects still hold up well. I hope whomever wrote this story has more of his/her work turned into a movie!",1415577600,,340,4.328125
7851158,5,6303544452,I LOVE this movie!  I saw it originally when it aired on TV.  I have continued to look for it on DVD and I would buy it whenever it comes out.  And then I would buy a few more copies to give to friends so they too could experience the wonderful story that is White Dwarf!,1389225600,2,271,3.8035714285714284
7851159,5,6303544452,This movis is the best and is one of my all time favorates.  I would recommend the movie to friends,1372550400,,99,3.95
7851160,4,6303544452,White Dwarf caught me by surprise. It was a well-written story with excellent production. Well worth adding to one's movie collection.,1357344000,,134,5.428571428571429
7851161,5,6303544452,"An interesting blend of Sci-Fi genres in one film, White Dwarf captured my attention when it was aired (2 part showing) on television. Steam Punk mixed with advanced space travel, a deadly virus, shape shifters, the eternal conflict of oppositional cultures, corrupt government, and a rather unique penal system, implemented by an off-world warden (who happens to be in the process of ""devolution"").
I liked it.",1315526400,2,411,5.242424242424242
7851162,4,6303544452,"OK, so I have owned the VHS for about 8 years, and let me tell you it was extremely difficult to obtain back then and even a few years ago was almost impossible to find & or own.  I notice the price for this  VHS remains rather high too.  Well, about the story it is really confusing, and there seems to be a lot of different things going on including genre intermingling , but the premise, of a ""dark side"", ""light side"" of a plant, which are comprised of 2 different society types is great.  It seems that everything including the proverbial kitchen sink was thrown in this movie; themes that just don't develope that start from interesting situations, camera shots, verbal comments, or whatever and are dropped.  A lot more plot development and some more back story is needed to pull this movie together.  Regardless, this film is haunting and I love it.  Unfortunately I only watch it once every two years-it is VHS. It would be great to get this in a remastered DVD version ""The planet Rusta, a white dwarf star light years from Earth in the year 3040"". This film was actually produced by Francis Ford Coppola!! Directed by Peter Markle, written by Bruce Wagner.  The film is a mere 91 minutes long (My VHS through Cabin Fever, International, Inc) 4 stars only because of the issues mentioned.  Lets get people raving so we can get it in DVD! Kya",1256688000,3,1351,4.504098360655738
