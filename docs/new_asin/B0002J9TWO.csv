8028201,4,B0002J9TWO,"I did not begin by anticipating a very effective performance of this work.
In any event, the plot is flimsy.
Even so, the production is a very fine, if not perfect, one.  There are lots of funfare and spectacular costumes (though some are quite bizarre), and on the whole what meets the eyes and ears are more than satisfying.
Of the huge cast, there are some clear standouts.
Corinna, the poetess that are being given the most spectacular vocal displays, is very effectively performed by Elena de al Merced.  The French  Comtesse di Folleville is being portrayed by Mariola Cantarero.  If not too visually convincing as being 'young and frivolous', Cantarero does deliver all the vocal goods required of the role.
By far the most convincingly beautiful portrayal comes from American mezzo-soprano Paula Rasmussen.  Her rich timbre carries the best among all the soloists, with the best stage presence.  That said, her major duet with Kenneth Tarver is not entirely even, with Tarver having a much thinner timbre and much drier vocal delivery.
In the same league of vocal delivery is Maria Bayo's Madama Cortese, who wishes to upstage every one on stage every time she starts singing, but fails at almost every instance.
Still four fully justified stars.",1327881600,,1254,4.976076555023924
8028202,5,B0002J9TWO,"I write this for those who are relatively new to opera, and who read over these reviews for assistance in deciding which one
to try ""this month"".(budget constraints, you know). I am confident you will delight in this one. I wish they were all so sublimely carried off as this one. It is mentioned in another review that this masterpiece by Rossini was ostensibly  meant to be a bon bon, performed for a special occasion of a French Coronation. The French Revolution had taken place many years before, which as it turned out was not a pretty sight thanks to barbaric excess. But now, there seems this chance to reclaim the old glory days of the Regency. So from all over Europe come the creme de la creme of society to attend the coronation and, of course, rub elbows with everybody who IS anybody. Alas, their plans are foiled, ""curses""...""drat it all"", and they must remain to celebrate the coronation from afar, in a gorgeous and sensuous spa. (awww) Here lies the opportunity to have a little fun with pomp and elitism, indulgence, and romance. Here also lies the opportunity to provide a glorious array of sublime melodic rapture. The difficulty of this opera is the sheer number of consummate talents required ( I counted 19 taking curtain calls?) . Rossini, ever gracious, allows each talent a gracious plenty of limelight opportunity, and miraculously, is able to provide each with a tour d'force aria- solo, pair, trio, quartet, quintet, octet...you name it. This is an opulent melodic romp from start to finish-an endless stream-an encyclopoedia of soaring, bird fluttering melodic line.

One of the most  astounding things is the very delicate balance of gorgeous people whether in sartorial splendor or in skivvies, managing to walk the  comedic tight rope taking themselves dead seriously, exuding melodrama, yet without ever once going too far with aping, or awkward bufoonery. I don't have any other word for it but consummate comedic artistry.

It is mentioned elsewhere here that Rossini brought some of the music over to his ""real"" opera buffa, ""Le Comte Ory"". I am afraid that if you see Il Viaggio a Reims first, Le Comte Ory will seem a let down. Dramma Giacoso is indeed a delicate art. It suffers with the slightest  heavy handedness... owing to which the tight rope walkers plunge. In this opera, they all remain gloriously aloft, cavorting and somersaulting with the greatest of ease.

The really nice thing about this opera, the story line is not so very critical...you know the story now...it is a series of melodramatic vignettes for vocal artists...you can just select the scene you want to see again..and you Will want to see them again...and again!

Oh how I wish more operas could be this superbly staged. What a glorious set, what glorious costumes, every bit player playing his or her part perfectly. The lighting beautiful. This is a fun opera, every scene.  I like the Russian, played by Kenneth Tarver, with a burning passion for the voluptuous and beautiful Polish Marchesa.
I must describe this one scene in the hope of enticing you-This scene being but one of numerous  wonderful sets-The Spanish regent, ""Don Alvaro"" ( played by Angel Odena -one of the most pleasant baritones you will ever hear ), is seen flirting with the gorgeous,and voluptuous Paula Rasmussen, playing the Polish Marchesa Melibea-and both are in turn of the century swimsuits in the Hot Tub Pool. What man would not flirt with her?
I want to draw your attention to the glorious melodies they sing- so joyous, flitting and soaring-so perfect for the scene. Even though it is a comic opera, Rosssini does not let anyone off lightly. Each one in turn sings a matching suite of melodies, requiring each to jump whole octaves at a single bound ( try this one you singers!). Paula gets to display her rich tambre and range, and so does her flirtatious partner in crime - partner in crime?  Well, immediately after they each proudly display their talents like a pair of peacocks,  while flirting shamelessly,-enters the Russian Regent Conte Libenskof, played brilliantly and with astonishing facility by Kenneth Tarver...it is now his turn to continue with the same complex and exceedingly artful melody set-but this time, it takes on a subtly different character...an ominous character, for the Marchesa is his ardent love interest. Kenneth also jumps whole octaves at a single bound. All the while the men are posturing like school boys about to engage in fisticuffs...and in their skivvies, I remind you. What perfect comedy. things ease down a bit, thanks to the timely and artufl intervention of the Marchesa...and Kenneth then goes into one of the most beautiful, heartfelt melodies. And it just goes on and on my friends! Kenneth Tarver both acts and sings supremely..one of the best in the entire opera ... (they are all so very good, though, how can one choose, really!  Following this enormous tension, easing bit by bit, then is heard in the distance, the tender aria by Corinna the Roman Poetess, who sings a peaceful, sensuous, a deliciously soothing aria followed by a fervent chorus of prayer by all, a curious blend of sincerity, contrition, and bombastic, tumultous joy. In the last scene The Roman Poetess, Elena de Merced, sings another tender praise of the ""King to be"", and all the hapiness and joy that will fall upon the populace now,  which she sings so sweetly... a sweet song which gradually becomes a majestic prayer again for blessings on the future,( don't forget that Rossini wrote wome of the most beautiful hymns ever composed ) sung by all on stage....while scenes of the grim future of Europe and the world are projected behind them...this is irony..sweet, brilliant irony. It is a masterpiece.",1140134400,8,5733,4.902992776057792
8028203,1,B0002J9TWO,"Not worth the money, in fact not worth a cent. Viaggio is a beautiful opera, but this version is wrecked by incompetant amateur singers, no costumes, and no scenery.",1139788800,2,165,4.724137931034483
8028204,2,B0002J9TWO,"En este dvd se recoge una muy interesante produccin de esa gran pera que es 'Il Viaggio a Reims', proveniente del Liceu de Barcelona. Si bien la produccin escnica (con piscina en escena includa) es divertida e ingeniosa, para montar esta pera hacen falta al menos 14 solistas de primer nivel, algo que aqu no se ha conseguido reunir. Solamente Mariola Cantarero (La Condesa de Folleville), Elena de la Merced (Corinna) y Josep Bros (Belfiore) brindan interpretaciones realmente interesantes. El resto del cast se mueve entre lo discreto y lo impresentable: Enzo Dara aporta su veterana y su conocimiento del rol, pero la voz no est; Mara Bayo desafina; Nicola Ulivieri podra estar mejor; Keneth Tarver no puede con su parte, y lo mismo cabe decir de Paula Rassmussen. Y estos son los papeles ms importantes. As no se puede montar esta obra.

La direccin de Jess Lpez Cobos es bastante correcta, pero tampoco consigue levantar el producto.

Es una pena que no se haya optado por sacar otra versin ms vlida de esta interesante obra. Se pueden encontrar interesantes vdeos de Psaro (1984 y 1999), Viena (1985) y Londres (1992) infinitamente superiores a esta grabacion. No se entiende porqu el Festival de Psaro no ha sacado alguna de sus ediciones en dvd.",1123891200,2,1253,4.877934272300469
8028205,5,B0002J9TWO,"I was quite excited when i first heard about a DVD of one of my very favorite Rossini Operas. Il Viaggio is an opera that is seldom perform and that laid dormant for way over a century. How wonderful to hear it here, with excellent singers (though msot not quite known) who give life to an unknown opera by many. Rossini's vivid and florid score is one of his best. There is so much invention here that it makes you wonder what more could have been composed by Rossini if he had continued composing after he retired with Giglielmo Tell. He definately take opera buffa to the highest levels of invention.  He knows how to tickel the heart and mind, how to add notes so that the exact emotion is sensed in the music even without understanding all the words. I found it very imaginative to put side by side the idea that this opera was composed SPECIALY for the coronation of Charles the X, with the contemporary ocassion of celebrating the Union of european countries into the European union (i think that just before the EU was enlarged from 15 members to 25). Wonderful and very imaginative. It excites me when designers and directos take a opera and try to somehow make it 'relevant' to contemporary times with events that the public feel more related to. It just gives a closer level of connection to that piece of artistic music. Would be wonderful to see more often such imaginative stagings.",1121904000,5,1396,4.561752988047809
8028206,2,B0002J9TWO,"I must respectfully disagree with the previous reviewers in that I found the singing mostly inept. There have been three other telecasts in Europe with better singers; see if you can track them down. Sound is excellent, production is beautiful, conducting very slack and some of the singing quite painful.",1102550400,5,305,5.12
8028207,4,B0002J9TWO,"As I watched Viaggio I couldn't help think of Strauss' Cappricio with its question,""Which is more important, words or music?""  No question here. The plot is just an excuse for Rossini to pour out strand upon strand of enchanting melody. I won't give any more details since they are wonderfully covered in another review.

I was a little apprehensive about ordering this since it is a real showpiece for 14 top singers and I knew none of these singers. Well, if this is what the Teatre Liceu can put out for Rossini we are in good hands. These young singers give me hopes for the furure. Only one was having a slightly off night. The rest are a joy to hear and to watch.  And the production does put some bones on the story.

If you enjoy bel canto this will be your cup of tea and you won't have to deal with some silly plot like Somamula or Puritani. Just one glorious number - solos, duets, trios, and finally a concertato for 14 (count them) solo voices. Only thing lacking is a mad scene. Thank God this was rescued from the dust bin of history and brought back to delight us all.",1097452800,18,1084,4.325123152709359
8028208,4,B0002J9TWO,"'Il Viaggio a Reims' is an extremely difficult opera to produce, largely because it requires the services of ten world-class soloists as well as four other singers who can hold their own in the huge ensemble that closes the first part of the opera. It was Rossini's last Italian opera and was, in its time, strictly a pi&egrave;ce d'occasion (the coronation of France's King Charles X) that he did not expect ever to be staged again; indeed, knowing this he recycled most of the music for his later sparkling French comedy, 'Le Comte Ory.' The piece lay unproduced for almost 200 years before it was mounted at Pesaro, Italy (Rossini's birthplace and the site of the Rossinian Pesaro Festival) in 1984. That production was recorded by Deutsche Grammophon and made a huge splash in the operatic world at the time. (It is still available at Amazon.) It featured such star singers as Katia Ricciarelli, Samuel Ramey, Ruggero Raimondi, Lella Cuberli, Cecilia Gasdia, Lucia Valentini Terrani, Francisco Araiza, Edoardo Gimenez, Leo Nucci and Enzo Dara. And since the plot of the work is structured by Rossini primarily as a showpiece for reigning singing stars of his time, the story-line is weak and simply an opportunity to line up a string of arias, duets, and other ensembles, with no semblance of credibility or dramatic engagement. The plot, simply, is that a group of European nobility and gentry making their way to Reims for the coronation of the French king are stuck in a spa, called the Golden Lily, and cannot make the last leg of the trip because there are no horses and carriages to be hired. They turn their virtual imprisonment there into a house party, with plenty of opportunity for romantic  intrigues and self-made entertainment (lots of singing, of course!). Thus, this long one-act opera (almost three hours, and here divided into two acts) is rather similar to the 'entertainment' so often provided in Act II of gala productions of 'Die Fledermaus.' As a result, one can say that a recorded or concert performance gives us most of the 'juice' of the piece without the distraction (or enhancement, if you prefer) of the silly plot. In this two DVD set, however, a performance mounted lavishly at Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu is presented, and I have to confess that the list of singers is, dare I say it, mostly competent and far from illustrious. Still, it makes its impact and in some spots is fully the musical equal of the Pesaro recording.

Amazon has not, at the date of this review, listed the ten main singers so I shall do so:

Corinna, a Roman improvising poetess:  Elena de la Merced, soprano
La Marchesa Melibea, a Polish lady, widow of an Italian general: Paula Rasmussen, mezzo
La Contessa di Folleville, a young widow, very fashion-crazed: Mariola Cantarero, soprano
Madama Cortese, a Tyrolean lady, hostess of the Golden Lily: Mar&iacute;a Bayo, soprano
Il Cavaliere Belfiore, a young French officer, enamored of Folleville: Josep Bros, tenor
Conte di Libenskof, a Russian general, enamored of Melibea: Kenneth Tarver, tenor
Lord Sidney, an English colonel, in love with Corinna: Sim&oacute;n Orfila, bass
Don Profondo, a man of letters and an antiquarian: Nicola Ulivieri, bass
Barone di Trombonok, a German major and passionate music-lover: Enzo Dara, baritone (repeating his Pesaro rle)
Don Alvaro, a Spanish grandee, also in love with Melibea: &Agrave;ngel &Ograve;dena, baritone

There are several musical highlights in the opera that are given their due: Corinna's two arias ('Arpa gentil' and 'All'ombra almena') are done brilliantly by de la Merced, and she receives a rapturous reception from the sophisticated Liceu audience, who indeed withheld their applause rather pointedly at some other spots in the score. The 'Gran Pezzo Concertato a 14 Voci' that ends the first part of the opera is simply spectacular, both in terms of Rossini's wit and craft, and in the performance. Don Profondo's comic aria, 'Medaglie incomparabili' in which he imitates the accents (while singing Italian, of course) of all the nationalities represented, is hilariously done. Good as Ulivieri is here, though, I must say that Ruggero Raimondi, in the Pesaro CD, outshines him both vocally and as an actor. The duet, 'D'alma celeste, o Dio,' by Tarver and Rasmussen as Libenskof and Melibea, is meltingly beautiful. (Both these singers, by the way, are real finds, with immaculate fioriture and the ability to blend perfectly with each other.) Unfortunately, Mar&iacute;a Bayo, the only singer previously known to me besides Dara, has a beautiful voice and a beautiful aria, 'Di vaghi raggi adorno,' at the very beginning of the opera, but was having a bad night; some of her singing above the staff is woefully under pitch.

The big disappointment here was the grafting onto this simple (even simple-minded) plot a hugely inappropriate attempt to convey 'big thoughts' about world events. Stage director Sergi Belbel, who also wrote a sententious essay in the program booklet, sets the action around 1900 and although that makes for interesting costumes and sets it makes no sense of the plot. Further, when he has back-projections of stills showing Hitler, the Vietnam war and other similarly horrendous scenes during Corinna's last aria, it makes no sense at all in spite of Belbel's special pleading in his essay. Another problem is that the booklet synopsis is scanty and there is no libretto; if one is unfamiliar with the opera it really takes some detective work to figure out who is who in the cast of characters.

Jes&uacute;s L&oacute;pez Cobos, known to me from his long tenure at the Cincinnati Symphony and one of my favorite conductors, is in the pit for this production and one simply couldn't ask for more flexible, alert, vibrant pacing for this comic gem. He gets marvelous playing for the Liceu's orchestra.

One is likely never to see another production of this opera, largely because it is so rarely done and because 'Le Comte Ory,' which contains so much of the same music, is rather more popular. So if you, like I, have been intrigued by the 1984 recording and want to see a production, this one will most likely have to be it. I will admit, though, that I'm unlikely to view it very often, and much more likely (as I've done in preparing this review) to pull out the old DG recording from Pesaro.
