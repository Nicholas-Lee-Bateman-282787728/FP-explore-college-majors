8479625,5,B005MQJP9E,Using some of these videos for my lessons in middle school music class. I wish there were captions for English as they help my students concentrate on what is being said in the video.,1493424000,,183,4.411764705882353
8479626,5,B005MQJP9E,"The box set is a thrill to watch. There is so much jazz history in these DVDs, that I'm missing sleep gladly.",1398643200,,109,4.0
8479627,5,B005MQJP9E,This was a gift for my fianc'e. He is a bis jazz fan and just loved getting this box set. The price was a great steal for me!,1381449600,,125,3.5
8479628,5,B005MQJP9E,"This is a box set that bundles five standalone videos from the Masters of Music series into an economical way to obtain them.  I'll briefly cover each of the videos, but will not go into deep detail since each has been reviewed in more depth on their respective product pages:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-American-Music-The-Story-of-Jazz/dp/B002Q1LKA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of American Music: The Story of Jazz</a>. This is what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-A-Film-By-Ken-Burns/dp/B000BITUEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz : A Film By Ken Burns</a>&nbsp;would have been like on amphetamines. It's fast and covers a lot of ground in 98 minutes. It's unfair to compare it to Burns' work, but I will say that it does not have any sub rosa agenda, and, while there are inevitable omissions, it's a decent - if compressed - history.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Celebrating-Bird-The-Triumph-of-Charlie-Parker/dp/B00000G3CX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Celebrating Bird: The Triumph of Charlie Parker</a>. Of the four biographies in this set, this was the weakest. That is not to say that it was without value, but it just did not flow like the others. On the other hand, the producers had some obstacles to overcome, not the least of which is the dearth of live film of Parker. This was balanced by commentary by Chan Parker and Rebecca Parker Davis, both ex wives,  as well as a large number of musicians who played with and knew Bird. There were no factual errors that I could discern, but it was all over the place in sequence.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-American-Music-Lady-Day-The-Many-Faces-of-Billie-Holiday/dp/B002Q1LK9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of American Music: Lady Day - The Many Faces of Billie Holiday</a>. Know that anything I say will be biased because I cannot get enough of Billie. Moreover this video included a lot of footage of Lester Young (my musical inspiration) and gave Teddy Wilson his due, which should caution you to take any accolades I heap on it was a grain of salt. There are some true gems of information here.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thelonious-Monk-American-Composer/dp/B00006672J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thelonious Monk -  American Composer</a>. This was one of the best, with first hand commentary by his family, as well as producers and fellow musicians. I had low expectations of this DVD, but cam away impressed and even more informed.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masters-of-American-Music-Sarah-Vaughan-The-Divine-One/dp/B00354XVJ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masters of American Music: Sarah Vaughan - The Divine One</a>. Next to the Monk bio, this was the best of the lot. Factual with the good and the bad, and it placed Sarah in her proper context within the music, including why she was so ""divine"".

Overall, this is a great set of videos that will provide a quick introduction to jazz and some of those who made significant contributions. Do be aware that some footage is shared across the entire set, giving a sense of Deja Vu as you watch the series, but that also has the effect of giving it a feel of an old, comfortable pair of shoes.

Also, if this set inspires you to watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-A-Film-By-Ken-Burns/dp/B000BITUEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz : A Film By Ken Burns</a>&nbsp;(which I highly recommend), you will see some of the same archival footage in that series - repeatedly!  However, this set is a great starting place, and, dare I say, would make a great gift for any lover of American music.",1335484800,15,3842,6.299047619047619
