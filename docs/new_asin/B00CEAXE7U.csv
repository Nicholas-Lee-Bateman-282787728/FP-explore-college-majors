5717289,2,B00CEAXE7U,"My boys, ages 4 and 7, loved this movie, but my husband and I were left wishing we'd just pulled out ""Goonies"" instead.  It was a fun, clean adventure story but just didn't have the polish I would have liked.  It felt a lot like a made for TV movie.",1376438400,2,249,3.96
5717290,1,B00CEAXE7U,"We just watched this with our kids.  It was truly terrible.  Bad acting, bad script, bad direction, bad editing.  Elements of a potentially-good story, completely buried in an endless stream of predictable cliches badly delivered.  We like silly, kitchy, predictable stories, but they must be told well, and this one isn't.  Truly not worth the time it'll take to watch.",1376092800,6,370,5.1

5717292,4,B00CEAXE7U,"Don't expect too much from this movie. It's a low budget film but it is well done. And with very good acting unlike some if not most B-movies. Story revolves around the adventures of Mickey and his new found friend Sully. They must follow a series of clues left by Mickey's grandfather. Along the way,they encountered alliances as well as enemies who will do everything in their power to stop Mickey. If they succeed it will be the end of the world as we know it. But will they?Watch the movie and find out. It also has references to the Civil War which makes it interesting. You will see familiar faces like Christopher Lloyd(Back to the Future),Ernie Hudson(Ghostbuster) and Lee Arenberg(Once Upon A Time).Rent the movie on Redbox($1.27) instead of Blockbuster if it's still in your area. Ours closed. Also it's cheaper than Amazon Instant Video or if you rent it from Xfinity On Demand.",1374364800,11,889,4.741935483870968
5717293,4,B00CEAXE7U,"Pleasant enough and well done enough adventure movie for kids with a typical treasure, follow the clues format.

Mickey and friends chase after the clues left behind by deceased grandfather(Christopher Lloyd).  The setting: Michigan countryside.  The clues lead to three ""elements"" that could unlock a mythical device.  Of course, a group of bank robbing badguys are after them.  Everything ties to the Civil War and secret societies and treasure.

The movie's nowhere near as involved or exciting as National Treasure, but it redeems itself by very good children actors, some veteran co-stars, fair editing and a story geared towards the elementary aged and above.

It's mostly lots of build-up and lots of dramatic music and a bit of action- most near the end.  The Civil War intentions are less than accurate, the badguys look creepy but soften it up by being moronic and falling for every juvenile trick in the book.  Christopher Lloyd is barely a cameo; however, Ernie Hudson(Ghostbusters) provides some good comedic umph.

Our kids liked it- therfore the 4 stars.  As a generous parent, I'd give it 3- I found it slow and boring in parts, maybe, because I'm hardened by the usual intensity that Hollywood shoves in our face.

Dove approved 4 Doves, there are scenes of endangerment, some knives, guns, fisticuffs and shin kicking by the heroine.  Mickey's parents are financially struggling, his girl friend's parents are dealing with a possible divorce(mentioned not delved into).  A behind-the-scenes featurette is included.  Overall, well shot and OK for family movie night.",1374278400,12,1583,5.177165354330708

5717300,4,B00CEAXE7U,"The star rating was a little tricky for me to decide this time. For me it would rate three stars, but that's because it's really a film for kids, which you realize a little way in. For kids I'd give it four stars because I think they'd be entertained by it, though even then I'm thinking eleven and under. since the massive success of The Lord of the Rings there was a big wave of fantasy films only recently subsiding in favor of comic book superhero films. Some spawned popular sequels and others wanted to. Some were aimed at a general audience, some at young adults and some were for kids. A big fan of the Tolkien books and films, I've been seeing some of these later films recently and have found some really good ones. The ones I've really liked so far were aimed at an older or at least a general audience, had larger budgets and very experienced actors. Two of my favorites were The Spiderwick chronicles and The Water Horse.

This film did not have the kind of budget those films had and the one experienced actor, Christopher Lloyd, had what was basically a cameo role. Overall it felt like a television production rather than a feature film and might have better as a cable series. The plot plays out mostly as a mystery as Mickey and his new friend Sully go about looking for three mysterious objects, encountering adventures and enemies along the way. As is usual for this type of plot, the location of these objects could have been spelled out rather than hidden in clues, but then you wouldn't have a movie. The scenario is a perfectly crazy idea about a secret Copperhead society wanting to revive the Confederacy by turning objects into silver through an alchemical machine. Just accept this plot contrivance because it makes no sense if you think about it.

After the set up it plays out about how you would expect. since it's aimed at a young audience I really can't complain too much. I think the'll have fun watching it. The two juvenile leads are winning and play their roles well enough. I do have a gripe about the comic villains, who I think are too comic. In fact, they're really buffoons and can't be taken seriously except for comic purposes. Is it really necessary to make the villains so silly for a younger audience? Would they really be so terrified if the villains were a little bit believable? i remember older films I saw as a child on television or at the movies where the villains weren't clowns. In any of the Robin Hood versions the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John were anything but clowns, yet I don't remember being traumatized by them. Just a thought, because they really made me lose interest in the film.

It's directed by Christian film director Harold Cronk (God's Not Dead), so it does have a sense of teaching values of honesty and integrity. Watch it with your kids or grandkids who will probably enjoy it.",1489795200,,2862,4.553398058252427

5717303,5,B00CEAXE7U,"Great fun for all ages.  Adults may have to do a little suspension of disbelief, but remember, this is a family movie.  It is intended to appeal to younger folks as well as adults, more so the kids.  Its plot includes some wild references to the Civil War and secret societies empowered by the President to safeguard precious items, which seems to have offended some viewers but makes perfect sense in context of the movie.  You might use this as an opportunity to discuss the real Civil War, the truism that all barrels have bad apples and how to spot them while believing in the goodness of most people,  or how real people with differing cherished beliefs can end up in a fight instead of trying to figure out a way that will work for both of them, as well as -though the movie does not go into this at all- subjects such as racism and slavery if age appropriate, with your kids.  So, you can have fun and turn it into education as well if you like.  At any rate the plot is fun and fantastic, intricate clues must be solved, the kids get the chance to save the day with the help of old folks (now THAT's Cool!), magic and pluck abound, and the story is visually entertaining as well.",1489104000,,1187,4.31981981981982

5717474,2,B00CEAXE7U,"Not okay for kids until they are old enough to view rated R, in my opinion. There are some scenes where it cuts away from an imminent prisoner torture and some where it shows close quarters battle. The Civil War is a complicated historical topic, and while this movie is really interesting for an adult, it is just not appropriate for kids not yet in highschool. The sleuthing part is really cool, but the premise of the theme is complicated for kids to understand, and the fact that some bad dudes are truly trying to kill the kids is just not okay.",1476057600,,550,4.401960784313726

It was a little cheesy at times as the dialogue / script needed some work. It was very ""Scooby Doo ish"" at some points and then ""National Treasure"" at most.

My 12 yo and 6 yo were like ""meh"" at the beginning. But 20 minutes in they were glued.

Child Co-star Sully was lots of fun, and a great little actress; she had some of the best lines and totally saved it for me. I think if the kids in your house are about the same age as the kids in the movie, it might be accepted by them as alternative entertainment if their digital handheld device rights have been timed out for the evening.

An Allan Quatermain movie or book would be better. We'd all like an accurate Fortean style excitement with at least Jules Verne grounding, however this movie fails too many times and provides too poor of an elementary level introduction to the subject for tweens with bad logic and a lack of general classical history. Percy Jackson is better, though I'd save this for variety fodder. It tries. I wanted to say better of it, though I can only tolerate it as an adult who knows better on the subject matter.

During those voyages Confederate Agents did investigate alchemy as the South was desperate for cash silver and gold.  Copperhead Agents were Northerners who were sympathetic to the South.  In this DVD movie, once again Christopher Lloyd stars with two teenage prodigies Derek Brandon and Francesca Derosa who are the star actors to decode mysteries in an adventure.  Derek Brandon stars in the role of Mickey Matson who drips of decency, morals, family loyalties and values of a good citizen and its not Hollywood Fantasy:  It is the ideal any family viewing is worthy of.  This is a family movie at its best, with historic facts of the Civil War that come alive.
