3444268,5,B0019VNXDA,"I bought this 8 dvd set of old TV shows, cartoons and movies from an era gone by. It has some wonderful shows, movies and cartoons of Christmas shows along with all the wonderful memories. Some of the TV shows are Ozzie and Harriet, The Bob Cummings Show, Liberace, Burns and Allen, Dragnet, Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol with Vincent Price, The Ruggles, Red Skeleton and other various TV shows of that era. The movies are, A Christmas Without Snow (1980), Scrooge (1935), The Miracle on 34th Street (1955), Santa Claus (1959)just to name a few of the movies. The cartoons are Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer, Jack Frost, Jingle Bells, Howdy Doody's Christmas, Merry Christmas, The elf and Mr. Little, Hector's Hectic Life just to name a few of the cartoons. Some of these shows are black and white and some are color. It is a great collection to have at Christmas time. It brings back so many memories of what Christmas used to be. Anyone who likes these old shows I would recommend buying this 8 dvd set of some great old shows, movies and cartoons of an era gone by. Amazon sells it for a great price to make it easier for you to own this 8 dvd set. I'm glad I purchased it. Sandy McClaflin",1264982400,5,1198,4.474885844748859
3444269,5,B0019VNXDA,"Don't buy this for the 50's picture quality, but what a hoot to see these old shows-- most likely for the first time if you're under 55.

Sitcoms from Peter Lawford & Betty White; a Dragnet ""stolen Jesus"" story; Ozzie & Harriet Nelson's teen idol son Rick (w/ legendary guitarist James Burton!) rocking the Eve; so-not digital cartoons; a Jimmy Durante film; Howdy Doody; beaucoup variations on A Night Before Christmas .... The list goes on & on.

Good stuff, and lots of it, especially at the price. A great gift: make some cocoa and share the old-school warmth.",1252886400,,564,4.686868686868687
3444270,3,B0019VNXDA,"Hours Of Holiday Watching!
That is the best thing I can say about this. From the old classic TV shows to very strange and forgotten Holiday movies of old - there is a lot to see on this DVD collection!

Most everything on here is fun and some quite good. However the production value is that of its original broadcast or film quality. The video tapes of the original broadcast would never hold up to the digital quality we have now with HD and more.

They compiled many Holiday Themed obscure TV shows, commercials and movies and made a really good comprehensive collection of some of the most extremely classic celebrities, performers and actors in the Holiday Theme.

Great deal for the price - just don't expect much in the quality department. The DVD's are fine - its just these are the original broadcasts that go back to the early 50's and the quality of TV back then was very scarry!

I enjoyed this collection - most of the time. 3-26-09",1238025600,10,945,4.508771929824562
3444271,5,B0019VNXDA,"This is an excellent collection of truly classic Christmas and holiday movies, cartoons, and TV shows. They bring back many good memories of ""Christmas's Past"". I remember watching many of these when I was a kid. And while some of the shows are not the best quality, I think that adds to their character. Lets face it, some of us that have been around as long as these films, have a few wrinkles ourselves. So don't hesitate to buy this collection if you like good wholesome entertainment.",1230681600,3,489,4.632183908045977
3444272,4,B0019VNXDA,"This ""FAMILY HOLIDAY COLLECTION"" with 12 Holiday Movies (from 1935 - 1964), 49 Holiday TV Episodes (1950's and 60's) and 27 Christmas Cartoons (1940's - 1960's) is a very nice mix of seasonal Favorites of yesteryear.  8 DVD's and over 40 hours of Holiday entertainment!

NOTE: Most is in Black and White format, direct VHS transfers, ALL 4:3 aspect ratio (Standard) and some are grainy with some audio inferiority.  But for the most part a very enjoyable and entertaining mix for the holiday's.

My favorites and suggested viewing for the movies: Beyond Tomorrow (1940) a very nice story about 3 old rich gentlemen who take in a young forlorn couple during the holidays (with a nice twist). The Miracle on 34th Street (1955 made for television) not as good as the 1947 version with Natalie Wood but still a fun story. And Scrooge (1935) a rare English version nice touch (a little grainy but a treat to experience).

My favorite Cartoons were The First Christmas, Howdy Doody Christmas, Jingle Bells, and Rudolph, the Red Nose Reindeer.

My favorite Tv episodes were many; All 5 of the ""Ozzie and Harriet"",  Racquet Squad (the Christmas caper), Charles Dicken's The Christmas Carol with Vincent Price as the narrator, The RUGGLES (Christmas Eve 1952) and the A Child is Born.  Also there is a BONUS virtual fireplace sequence too!! (very clear with crackling burning logs in COLOR)

Just sit back and enjoy some really memorable Christmas / Holiday fun!! I recommend this Collection for any family there something here for everyone!!!!  Enjoy.",1228176000,38,1543,4.945736434108527
3444273,5,B0019VNXDA,"a lot has been said about the quality of this set. it is presented the way the programs were produced in the past. it's a great way to look and remember the way we used to watch tv. the movies, programs and cartoons are great although i must admit there were several i had never heard of! i loved it!!",1358812800,4,301,4.033333333333333

the quality is not much to be admired, but otherwise alot for the $",1357084800,,124,4.208333333333333
3444275,3,B0019VNXDA,"Some of the stuff here (and there is plenty) is good in an archeological sort of fun way.  The cartoons are pretty bad.  None are funny but little kids might enjoy them for their Christmassy themes.  The movies are a hit and miss bunch that no one has ever seen--for good reason.  But the greatest saving grace is the Mexican movie Santa Claus--the worst movie ever made.  It begins with truly obnoxious children singing songs from every country for an unendurable amount of time and then somehow goes to outer space and ends up in Hell.  It is a laugh riot for afficionados of egregious filmmaking.  I highly recommend this set.  I have yet to watch the Yule Log disc, but the rest is well worth the inexpensive price.",1331942400,,719,4.51937984496124
3444276,1,B0019VNXDA,"I was very excited about this collection of nostalgic Christmas programs because my family has been watching many of them year after year on my father's aging projector.  It was definitely time to take a step up in technology.  However, neither of the DVDs in this collection would play on the DVD player.  We were able to get them to play on our computer, but the video production was of such poor quality, we would be better off watching them on reel-to-reel.  The vids look like someone copied them to DVD from a VHS tape.  Because they are not mastered, the sound differs from one vid to the next.  Some videos froze and others skipped.

When I requested a refund from Amazon, they were happy to oblige and said that I needn't bother returning the DVD collection.  That should tell you something about the product quality when Amazon doesn't want to be bothered with restocking it.",1326585600,,885,4.628205128205129
3444277,1,B0019VNXDA,"Let me start by saying that the amount of Christmas related shows on this DVD is incredible, as is the content- some very rare and hard to find cartoons and shows appear on the list. I was so excited to see some of my childhood favorites- old cartoons from far before my time that I watched with my family every year. But the quality of the transfers on these dvds is absolutely horrid. Some of the cartoons actually look like someone shot a (shakey) video of the the program while it played on a TV. My other issue with the dvd is that 2 of the cartoons that I bought this collection for are mislabeled and not the ones I was looking for. ""Silent Night"" and 1968's ""The Night Before Christmas"" are excellent and extremely rare cartoons that I cannot find on DVD. They are listed on this box (under cartoons) but when I played the dvd they were on they were not the correct cartoons- rather neither was a cartoon at all. I thought that perhaps all would be saved by ""Santa and the Three Bears"" (another favorite and one that is hard to find) but the quality was so poor that I could not stand to watch it. I am so disappointed and hoping I can find these wonderful cartoons elsewhere with good quality. Heck, after seeing how bad this transfer is I would settle for dvd with decent quality.",1321574400,,1290,4.3347107438016526

3444279,5,B0019VNXDA,"We saw this in a store last year and my wife wanted it for our collection. How right she was! It contained holiday episodes featuring not only some legendary favorites like The Beverly Hillbillies and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet, but some forgotten early shows definitely worth a second (or first) look. My son was complaining when we started watching these because, as every teenager knows, if it's black and white, it isn't right. But by the time the first couple of episodes were over, he was getting into it, cheering on Captain Gallant, laughing at Jack Benny's antics and almost moved to tears by a particularly moving episode of Dragnet. I'm getting another copy this year as a gift for someone special. If you have a few extra bucks and need to beef up your Christmas DVD collection, give yourself a gift and add this one to your cart!",1316476800,6,851,4.642384105960265
3444280,4,B0019VNXDA,"I really enjoyed the Holiday Family Collection of DVDs.  Great variety of programs!  Every entertaining.

I didn't give it 5-stars because some of the dvds would not play properly in my tv/dvd combo, which is a few years old.  Some of the dvds when played, would make a noticably loud noise.  Some of the programs would skip or not play.  If I wanted to watch these programs, I would have to play them in a newer dvd player.

Also, I first saw this dvd collection in a mail order catalog.  I looked on Amazon to see if I could find it at a cheaper price, and I did!",1298678400,,565,4.166666666666667

8275386,4,B0019VNXDA,"I picked up this 8 disc set on sale last year one month after Christmas for under ten dollars. It's made up entirely of public domain TV material, cartoons, old movies, and some educational films. Okay, the quality on some of this material isn't that great...it's similar to VHS, but you sure get plenty of rare nostalgic Christmas stuff to watch! There are great TV shows like the Beverly Hillbillies, Dragnet, Jack Benny, Ozzie and Harriet, Colgate Comedy Hour, Petticoat Junction, and more! 12 Rare Christmas films like Beyond Tomorrow and the 1935 version of Scrooge. The Holiday Family Collection is a combination of two Mill Creek 4 disc packs. Holiday TV Classics and Holiday Family Classics. This DVD pack includes 12 feature films, 49 holiday TV episodes and 27 cartoons...it's running time is 42 hours! It's highly unlikely that any of this stuff will show up on regular TV during the holidays. In the mood for an old fashioned Christmas? Well then, with it's abundance of material from the 1940's through the 1970's, this set will definitely have you feeling quite nostalgic in no time.

And tv special were fun to watch. Cartoons were so old i did not remember any of them  That was a bit disappointing.  I rated it a three because it wasn't a bad deal and 1/2 of the shows were good and 1/2 were not worth the time.  But for the price. Not a bad deal.,1366675200,,434,3.7777777777777777
