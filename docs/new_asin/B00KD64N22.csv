Tom Hardy is a key but ancillary character.  A Frenchman who joins the French Foreign Legion with two buddies from Spain.

It's 1960 so they are sent to Algeria for their mandatory minimum service of 5 years to fight France's ill fated attempt to keep its colony in Algeria.  They ostensibly fight the Algerian resistance, but they also fight the French colonists who don't want to leave Algeria as well as the regular French army under DeGaulle which wants to cut its losses, declare victory, and go home to France

The film centers on an English volunteer who wrote the book upon which the movie is based.

Their indoctrination/boot camp is hell, but this group of unlikely misfits bonds into a unit.  It quickly becomes obvious to the Brit that the French do not belong in Algeria after he tries to befriend Algerians and French colonists, the Pied noir or black feet
