8346910,5,B001W4BTUS,"This is an amazing, typically French comedy.
It is blessed with nuanced humor that has very little resemblance to the ""raunchy""/bathroom kind found in a typical Hollywood comedy and is very funny and engaging.

In order to safe his job, the main protagonist invites his boss over for dinner. The protagonist and his wife are a bit clueless in many ways, including in how to present themselves. The couple's neighbor points out that the problem is in their apartment and helps them to make changes that would make a good impression on the important guest.

I highly recommend this movie to people with varying cinematic tastes, and, certaintly, to those who like traditional French comedies (which I grew up wathicng).",1359072000,,717,4.966666666666667
