8588480,5,B00D29AAJM,"Cliff Richard was a acting surprise for me.  He does a very good, believable job; very real-life like.  It was hard for me to imagine him playing a cynical young man getting into illegal activities, but he convinced me.  Totally uninhibited, and very into character.  I found the movie fascinating for it's British life portrayals, as well as for the spiritual changes portrayed.  A very good flick to show young people, and everyone else should enjoy it as well.  Mostly wholesome.",1498089600,,482,4.888888888888889

8588482,3,B00D29AAJM,"Not as good as the other Cliff Richard movies that I have seen. As I have not seen Expresso Bongo and Serious Charge, I cannot compare with these two films.
There may have been a disc problem as it seemed to end abruptly with a fade to black, no end credits.",1482796800,,258,4.078431372549019
