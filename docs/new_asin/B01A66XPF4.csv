8746569,1,B01A66XPF4,I purchased this wonderful dvd set and was absolutely disappointed.  The one I  received appeared to be a recorded version with advertisements and ticker tape events of what may have have been going on in Korea. Love the drama but was sad I had received a failed product.,1523577600,,271,4.625

8746578,4,B01A66XPF4,"In FALLING FOR INNOCENCE (AKA BEATING AGAIN) director Young-Soo Ji creates a vision of modern day Korea in which the protagonist starts out as the heavy the antagonist seems the hero and the female lead loves neither. Though this approach is certainly novel enough, the viewer is required to shift gears to accommodate this metamorphosis. The pseudo-heavy is Kang-Min ho (Kyung Ho Jung) who swaggers into a factory and loudly proclaims that he has just bought it lock, stock, and barrel. His first action is to lay off nearly all the workers after which he will sell the corpse for a profit. Now this sounds very much like what Barack Obama accused Mitt Romney of in 2012 but in this case, Kang-Min ho is a true corporate destroyer who views human beings as disposable cannon fodder. Enter pretty secretary Kim Soon-jung (So-yeon Kim) who is in love with police detective Ma. They plan to marry but detective Ma learns of a scheme to defraud the public and he is killed to keep him quiet.  Enter the seeming hero Lee Joon-hee (Hyun-min Yoon) who also loves Kim Soon-jung. When detective Ma dies, Lee Joon-hee tries to win over Kim Soon-jung. At this point, FALLING FOR INNOCENCE seems likely to evolve into a fairly conventional Korean romantic triangle. But director Young-Soo Ji quickly changes the trajectory.

  Kang-Min ho is a sick man with a failing heart. He needs a heart transplant and he gets one--from detective Ma. Now there is nothing wrong or weird about that but in this case, the heart of the late detective carries within it the distinctive personality of its former owner. Kang-Min ho begins to think, act, and feel like detective Ma. And of course the enduring love of detective Ma is resurrected in the heart (and soul) of Kang-Min ho.  This reappearing of a seemingly lost love elevates FALLING FOR INNOCENCE into the realm of fantasy. The reaction of Kim Soon-jung to what seems to her an inexplicable mystery is step one in the change of dramatic positions of the two male leads. The villain and hero swap places even as detective Ma's heart did. The ability of the audience to accept this is a marker of how far they can go in accepting how two rivals merge into one another.

  There is a great deal to like in what starts out as a conventional romance but winds up as most un-conventional. Western audiences may have difficulty accepting a wide range of Korean romantic dramatic staples: the goofy sidekick, the non-stop soliloquizing, the extreme prudery of all concerned, and the heavy-handed overuse of slapstick forehead smacking. Yet, the acting often involves surprisingly tender moments that suggest that beneath the omnipresent Korean facial mugging lie some pretty universal emotional entanglements that center on a change of heart both figuratively and literally.",1456358400,,2800,4.8924050632911396
