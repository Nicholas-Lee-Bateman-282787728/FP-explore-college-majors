1018058,5,6305374961,"""City Hunter"" was adapted from a Japanese comic book and animated series of the same name... and it shows! The actors do the kind of double-takes, gestures, and poses that one expects to see in a  ""manga"" or ""anime."" This adds greatly to the hilarity  of the film.
The story revolves around Ryu Saeba (Jackie Chan) who is  hired to track down a run-away heiress. He ends up on a luxery liner,  trapped between his jealous secretary, the attractive heiress, a sexy  gun-toting female agent, and a group of terrorists bent on capturing the  ship and holding the passengers for ransom. And all Ryu wants is a bite to  eat... he made the mistake of skipping breakfast!
If you typically pick  up Jackie Chan movies for the amazing stunts, this might not be the film  for you; there really isn't much of that kind of action here, until the  climactic scenes. However, if have an appreciation for slap-stick and  screwball comedies, I recommend this flick highly!",950832000,12,956,4.698795180722891
1018059,4,6305374961,"When I first saw this movie on VHS years ago it instantly became one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies.  Most of Jackie's movies are serious, action oriented, and comedy is a side prduct of the excellent action and stunt  sequences.  City Hunter is one of his few movies where he purposely takes  over the top comedy to the extreme.  One thing that bothered me about the  DVD version, and prevented me from giving the movie 5 stars, was the intro  song and ""Gala Gala Happy"" were not translated and subtitled.  When you know the lyrics the songs are hilarious so i was very dissapointed  when there was no translation in english for the songs.  Overall this is a  movie I will watch over and over and force anyone who visits to watch it.",948067200,4,737,4.425373134328358
1018060,2,6305374961,"This movie was very disappointing.  Many parts were quite funny, especially the Street Fighter scene.  But the action was a bit to weak me.  Too many shenanigans and dumb jokes.  The supporting characters were very  annoying too.",947980800,2,229,5.081081081081081

1018062,1,6305374961,"This may have been one of those movies Jackie did as a favor to a friend.  If so, it must have been a REALLY good friend.  This has to be by far the worst Jackie Chan movie since the 1970's.  It is silly, sophomoric, and  moronic.  Jackie does almost none of the of the great stunt work he is  famous for.  Instead, he just clowns around mugging for the camera like  it's some sort of home movie for his friends. And it is not even his voice  in the soundtrack.
As a matter of fact, the only laughs I had during this  movie were the poorly done English subtitles: ""Out of bullets!  What a  miser!""
I was expecting something really good after reading these  other reviews.  To each his own, I suppose.  My first Jackie Chan movies  were the Police Story series.  If you are looking for another one of those,  this is not it!
This movie makes me wonder why great films like  ""Police Story"" are not out on DVD and most of Jackies worst films  are.  Save your money and avoid this one.",945993600,3,981,4.194594594594594

1018182,3,6305374961,"I great up watching this on VHS (remember those ;-) ?).  I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan and this movie was a real winner.  I know that it is based on a manga (Japanese-style comic book or ""Graphic Novel"" as they like to call it), which I have never read, but probably would have enjoyed.  The movie's lighthearted comedic style was just what I needed as a little pick-me-up.  There were only a few things that made me raise an eyebrow, though not all of these things were necessarily bad, just unexpected.

Notes: When watching the movie, the first thing I noticed was that it was in the Cantonese dialect.  This may very well have been the original recording, but I honestly thought that it was going to be in Mandarin.  No big deal, I can understand both.  There were some scenes where the lines got changed and made it less amusing (sad day, but I'll deal).

If you switch to English dub, the voice actor for Jackie Chan is all right...but I was really, really, hoping that Jackie Chan would have dubbed himself (he does that, you know.  He can speak in Cantonese, Mandarin, and English).  I guess this recording was made before he was proficient in English.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I was let down.

If you have English subtitles on, they are accurate for the most part.  I wished that they didn't change it from the VHS subtitles.  In some places, they translate it literally, which takes away from the scene.  They would have done better to use idioms.  In other places, they used illustrations that were totally different from what was used in the VHS.  Sometimes it worked better, other times it didn't.  Needless to say, I was let down.

Apparently, I had the edited version of the movie.  There were SO MANY scenes in the movie that weren't on my VHS copy.  If any of you know the differences between American humor and Asian humor, this is for you.  I completely understand why they cut some of those scenes out.  It just would NOT have been handled well given our American culture.  The drawback of course is that it made for some confusing scenes.  I remember watching this movie and thinking, I wonder how it got to these certain points in the movie...and now I know.  Watching this DVD with all of the scenes helped me understand the flow of the movie better, though it did make me cringe.  My roommates would wander in and out of the living room and go, ""wow...""  To which I would feel the urge to respond, ""this was NOT in the version that I watched growing up as a kid!""  However, I'm very familiar with Asian humor so that aspect didn't bother me.  What did bother me was that there were some people I wanted to watch this movie with and now I don't think I can.  At least, not without offending them or making them feel very awkward.

Summary: I fell in love with the VHS version of this movie.  Though parts of it were unexplained, it didn't take away from the movie as a whole.  It was hilarious and just a good time (5 stars).  This DVD version changed enough things that made me think that it was not as funny, whether dubbed/subbed in Chinese or English (-1 star).  Also, the unedited scenes kind of narrowed the audiences that would find this movie acceptable (-1 star).",1399075200,,3196,4.438898450946644

I guess making the comic into a movie didn't translate to well.

1018190,5,6305374961,This is a live action anime.  Very very funny.  Live action anime means that they are going to be very over the top and very fun.  There are a few scenes that I know will make anyone from 20 to 35 laugh histerically.  The bad guys are great.  Skilled and very good at physical comedy.  Great timing.  I would love to see more like this since Jackie loves comedy.  This might not be his best movie... but I would definatly call it his most hilarious.  That is saying something.,1207353600,,476,4.258426966292135
1018191,3,6305374961,"This really isn't that bad of a movie for what it is.  City Hunter is based off of the Japanese cartoon City Hunter, and although this is not an animated film, it is presented as such with loads of cheesy dialouge, goofy characters, cheesy music, and cartoony sound effects.  If that wasn't enough, the English dubbing version makes it just about as silly as it can get.  Chan's voice unfortunately is not dubbed by himself in the English version, although his English voice-over is present in many of his H.K. films.  The biggest reason anyone may want to own this film is that is also features charcaters played by Richard Norton (Road House 2, Mr. Nice Guy, Rage and Honor) and Gary Daniels (White Tiger, Rage, Riot) - the two bad guys.

At some point you may end up turning this movie off before the end arrives, if you are not into such a goofy film.  However, the ending is rewarding with a strong 5 minute fight with Jackie Chan against Richard Norton.  Easily the best entertaining fight in the film, the Richard Norton character beats up Chan repeatedly with 2 short poles that can change into numchucks.  Jackie does some cool small stunts using chairs and tables in the scene.  There is also 2 fights with Jackie against the Gary Daniels charcater.  The first fight is pretty short in a cabin on the cruise ship. The 2nd fight is just the silliest darned thing I have ever seen.  Street Fighter video game fans might enjoy it.  Jackie is thrown into an arcade machine, electricuted, and begins to take the form of various Street Fighter 2 characters, while Gary Daniels is Ken.  The scene is no more than for laughs.  The fight is set to look like someone is button mashing the controls to the game.  When Chan becomes Chun Li, that was actually pretty funny.

As for the story itself, its pretty simple.  A bunch of bad guys led by the Richard Norton character board a cruise ship and eventually expose their demands - robbing the crew.  Jackie Chan gets involved and tries to stop them.  The film is filled with action, but its mostly gun fire and chases, aside from the 2 forementioned fights.

Although most Jackie Chan films are never very serious, this one is beyond silly.  Its set to be that way, so if you are ready to see a cartoony film created with real people, then you may want to check it out.  It tries to be funny throughout, but it pretty much failed for me.",1189814400,4,2387,4.489559164733179
1018294,5,6305374961,"this flick is kinda cool... although i prefer the fighting sequences. i think that they tried to do this flic an family action flick. but anyways, what impresses me the most in this film is that use see how good people from the west is comparing to people from the east. take th fight scene jackie chan v gary daniels. u see that this is withoutv a doubt gary daniels best performance... jackie is funny as usual... if  like jackie chan, or gary daniels thisis a must see movie",1154908800,,477,4.359550561797753

1018296,1,6305374961,"I've been reading the reviews... and noticing how everyone who gave it 'top marks' saying it was 'hylarious', 'the bets movie ever', and so on and so forth, have never seen the original anime, or even better, read the manga.

If they had I'm sure none of those people would give it more than it's due - 1 star (for J.C. fans, maybe 2).

This movie is a poor excuse for an adaptation. And a disgrace for the original City Hunter. Jackie Chan as Saeba Ryo?! Puh-lease!

The attempts at manga/anime humor fall on barren ground and turn the movie into an even more of a farce as it already is.

I wouldn't recomend this movie not even to my worst enemy and I agree with the reviewer who said 'when you die and go to Hell, Satan makes you watch this movie'. I can't imagine a torture greater than that. I'd take boiling oil any time!",1143763200,2,828,4.254777070063694
1018297,5,6305374961,"I absolutely love this movie! If you're looking for a humerous movie that you can just watch and laugh, then City Hunter is the movie for you.

My favorite part in the entire movie is where Jackie Chan is electricuted and imagines himself in a video game where  he can change characters and has special powers to fight of the main villian.

I was a little lost however on some of the roles of  various characters in the film as I have never read, nor seen the original Japanese cartoon strip from whence this movie was pulled from. But the confusion doesn't really get in the way of watching and enjoying this movie.

Just one more little thing; its probally best to watch this movie in its original language as the English track doesn't have Jackie's voice over, unlike in some of his other dubbed films. As long as you don't mind reading subtitles. Otherwise you'll love this movie....after all, who doesn't like Jackie Chan?",1133827200,12,927,4.593939393939394

I did not see the anime of city hunter but from what i saw in the movie i bet they tried hard to keep to the series with the kind of antics the people in the movie do. I am writing this review without finishing watching the movie, but so far the movie is excellent. The voice is not Jackie Chan's though. Its some one else just like what they did with Gorgeous.
ONE THING I MUST WARN YOU ALL THOUGH IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE COVER SAYS WIDESCREEN THE MOVIE IS FULL SCREEN.
I bought this movie in best buy for 9.99 and was hoping for the widescreen like it says on the box. this is not a two sided dvd where one side is wide and the other normal. The DVD itself does not say if it is widescreen or full screen. it just say the movie name on it.
I hope this is a screw up on the part of 20th Century Fox where some dum guy mixed a full screen DVD in the widescreen box, but if it isn't then they SUCK real bad. STOP FALSE ADVERTISING to make movie off of Jackie Chan's name.  But i didn't find a full screen dvd for sale even online.

After that, you will be wondering what dolt thought that this would make a good movie. It is only about 90 minutes, but it is so bad that it seems like days when the movie is finally over. I remember reading an interview with Jackie Chan where he commented that this was the worst film that he had ever made, and if you make the mistake of watching it I think you will agree. It is based off of an anime series by the same title. The anime is better, and would rate about 2 1/2 stars. The film fails to capture even the average quilty of the anime. If you enjoy watching bad movies for laughs, I would strongly recommend that you avoid this one.

In the listing on the back cover, it says ""Hilarious"", but I sat through 50 minutes of the movie and grew sick to the stomach. Jackie seems restrained by the character he is forced to portray. It seems as if this is a comic-book based movie. In that, the most annoying part of the movie is EVERY FIVE MINUTES, Jackie strikes a pose, the action stops and a chorus of girls sing the words ""City Hunter"" while Jackie freezes in a Vogue.
I never finished the movie because I was so queasy that I could take no more. Sort of like the sensation one gets after drinking milk, orange juice, and eating a raw slab of fish that still squirms with its last meal of worms.
There is no acting, there is hardly any action, and when the movie pauses for a pathetic song and dance routine on the ship where they cannot decide if they are singing in English or Chinese, that's the last straw. (...)",1008547200,3,1084,4.241545893719807
1018370,5,6305374961,"I really like this movie a lot!  I first saw it at a Hong Kong film fest at the mall in its uncut subtitled form.  I later rented it from a Blockbuster and it was dubbed and many of my favorite scenes were cut out.  Don't rent from that place if you can help it!
Anyway, this movie is about Ryu Saeba, a private detective of considerable ability.  Well, he is cool anyway.  OK, he likes women and is otherwise not too competant, but he is a good fighter and acrobat.  He ends up getting a case to find a rich man's daughter and follows her onto a cruise ship that just happens to be a terrorist target!  Hilarity and action ensues as Ryu fights the bad guys.
I really enjoyed the ""Gala Gala Happy"" rap video in the middle of the movie (this is one that was missing from the Blockbuster version).  Also cool:  Jackie Chan gets turned into various Street Fighter characters.  The top heavy secret agent (well secret agent's friend) is not to be missed either!",1003276800,3,957,4.29608938547486

I first saw this as a low qulity fansub, so finding the DVD was very nice. I've never seen the City Hunter anime (or read the manga), but this movie certianly makes me want to! If you get a laugh out of seeing anime-style humor (falling down, giant mallets, etc.) done in REAL LIFE, then you'll love this! The Street Fighter scene is definately the best (and I'll leave it at that so it's not runined for people who have never seen it). Another great scene is the performance of ""Gala Gala Happy"", which is a cool song IMO.
If you're an anime fan who likes Jackie Chan, then buy this NOW! If you're not an anime fan, but like Jackie Chan, then you will probably enjoy this.

I think ""City Hunter"" is one of the best examples of this.  From the opening bell, this flick is pure kung-fu camp.  Even though the plot seems serious enough, the seriousness is dashed on the rocks by Jackie's (and the supporting cast's) on-screen antics filling every scene.  The physical humor is absolutely side-splitting, and the best part is, Jackie's not the only one pulling it off!  Nearly the entire cast contributes a moment or two of tomfoolery.  The movie did an outstanding job of capturing that anime feel.  It's like watching a live-action comic book!  Australian martial-arts star Richard Norton makes a great lead villian (he's even better in ""Mr. Nice Guy""), and Gary Daniels is awesome as his head flunkie.  The exchanges between him and Jackie make for the best fight scenes in the film, although the last battle between Jackie and Norton is a smash as well.  The fight between Jackie and Daniels in the ship's arcade is by far one of the most bizarre spectacles in the history of chop-socky; you've just gotta see it to believe it.  Although it's not the best-known, it's definitely one of Jackie's best flicks; every aspect of it makes it a must-buy for fans of this genre.",987638400,3,1356,4.772532188841201

My two friends hated this movie alot, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. Jackie Chan has done better, no doubt, and this is not for first timers. Its an attempt at creating the world of Anime in a non-animation setting. I appreciate what its trying to do, and it had alot of funny gags that you would find normally in an anime.

It is uncomfortable to enjoy the movie when it turns so stupid.  There is a good scene in which Chan, fighting inside a movie theatre, imitates the movements of Bruce Lee on the screen.  But thhat scene alone is not worth the experience of ""City Hunter""",973209600,,661,4.53781512605042

The Street Fighter II parody in this film is more enjoyable than the 1994 movie starring Jean Claude Van Damme. Jackie Chan did this film as a favor to his Japanese fans. Chan also starred in Crime Story the same year. Crime Story was a dark, violent crime drama.
Chan was cast as Ryu Saeba, a private investigator. A Japanese businessman hires him to find his daughter. City Hunter has some problems. There's sexist and homophobic jokes. Wong Jing added a silly Cantopop song/dance number(Gala Gala Happy) in the film. Jackie Chan and Wong Jing had creative conflicts at the time. The plot is a rehash of Die Hard and Under Siege. Joey Wong was cast as Kaori, Ryu's partner. Joey Wong was great in the A Chinese Ghost Story series of films. Chingmay Yau was cast as a secret agent. Australian martial artist Richard Norton was cast Mac, the villain who takes over a luxury cruise ship. Yuen Woo Ping's 1995 film Red Wolf was similar to this film.

I HATE it when they have someone else dub JC's English...I don't care if he's got an accent, I can't stand to hear someone else's voice coming from Jackie...especially when they get someone with a really irritating voice, as here.",1445126400,,477,4.888888888888889

Fun party video to sit around and riff against,  if you're in the right mood. Somewhat slow pacing between very entertaining fight sequences may bore the more twitchy people in the room. Older audiences will appreciate the jokes more.",1404432000,,341,4.779661016949152
