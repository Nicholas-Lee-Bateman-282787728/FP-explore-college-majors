8010830,4,B0001DHSEW,I've been a John Cena fan since his debut in 2002. This was actually his best best dvd to date. The only problem I had with the dvd was it didn't start off with his whole career from start to finish of how he debuted against Kurt Angle pushing Kurt to the limit and getting respect from The Undertaker. It also didn't show his 1st title win against Big Show at Wrestlemania 20 for the United States title where it began for his 1st title run and reign as being the best in the business new rising up and comer talent that he was. It really just focuses on his rap persona being a top dog dissing all comers making a name for himself going from a full fledged bad guy heel to an unconditional loved fan favorite icon at that time in his career. Great dvd to buy if you're a real John Cena fan and really appreciate the art of hip hop and battle rapping.,1418256000,,852,4.107784431137724
