Most critics either praised this to the skies, calling it as powerful as
Bergman. or they damned it for being slow, too familiar, sappy and
not special. I lean more towards the positive.

First of all this is a wonderful bunch of older actors (Max Von Sydow, Susan
Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne, Christopher Plummer) and, as one would expect,
they each bring a lot to their roles.

It is also beautifully photographed.

If not quite Bergman, I do buy it as 'Bergman-lite'; the same sense of the
confusing complexities of the human heart, and the way earlier damage done
always comes back to haunt us.

Yes it has a few over-the-top moments, and it ultimately didn't pack quite the
punch I expected, but I was never bored, despite the deliberate pace, and found
each of these lost souls quite compelling.",1320451200,3,950,4.630952380952381
