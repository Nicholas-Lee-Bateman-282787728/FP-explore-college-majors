Just don't watch the English subs unless you're hosting a ""bad movie night"".",1498176000,,248,4.928571428571429
7880278,5,630489855X,"Not for everyone, but I thought it was hilarious and visually stunning! Plus....it's Denueve! :)",1414108800,,96,5.466666666666667
7880279,1,630489855X,This movie is awful to watch in English. The dubbed voice of Marcello Mastriani kinda sounds like 70's TV Detective Frank Cannon! Avoid boring yourself to death!!!,1381622400,,163,5.074074074074074
7880280,4,630489855X,"I like it because it's so silly.  I also waited for this DVD release for so many years because the theme song ""L'evenement Le Plus Important Depuis Que L'homme A Marche Sur La Lune"" by Mireille Mathieu is a great song, but it's never released on any of her CDs.  I hope that the film and soundtrack will be remastered.",1120348800,3,318,4.283333333333333
7880281,1,630489855X,"I saw this movie around 20 years ago and it was easily the worst movie Deneuve, Mastrionni, or Demy ever did.  It's excruciating to watch.",1120176000,5,138,4.52
