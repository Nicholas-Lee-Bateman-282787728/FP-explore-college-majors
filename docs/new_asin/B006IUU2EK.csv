8498887,2,B006IUU2EK,Not so much this one. It follows a meter maid who finds out he is terminal and his quest to fix a broken meter. The only character that I found mildly interesting was his friend Jay. I would say pass on this one.,1378252800,,212,3.953488372093023
8498888,5,B006IUU2EK,"First, for whatever it's worth, I really enjoyed this movie.  I don't normally rate movies for the simple fact that tastes vary.  So, I will limit my review to objective measures.

1.  The story is excellent and the screenplay is well done.  This is a timeless story that appeals to basic themes relevant to us all.  The writer explores these themes using the slightly surreal world of a painfully average man who really has a satisfying, yet mind-numbingly boring life.  He faces his own death calmly, but his loved ones and friends completely lose it around him and try to change his life by projecting their own hopes, fears and desires onto Randall, who is too polite to resist them.  He is literally under siege by people who want to ""help"" him.  The result is a very funny and touching story.

The comedy and tragedy of his life made me laugh out loud.  There are ""over the top"" scenes, carefully kept in perspective by the bland straight-man lead character, Randall Zimmerman, possibly the world's most boring man.  This character is like a toned-down Stan Laural playing straight man to an insane world.  He manages to find meaning in a meaningless existence as a ""parking enforcement officer"" for a university campus.  He finds joy in small everyday experiences, but nobody around him seems to understand this.  The character is delightful and shows the value of very ordinary people.

""I know I'm making a difference.  Without parking enforcement, there would be complete chaos...and there's nothing worse than that.""

Rachel Tucker, I salute you.  Good job.

2.  The acting is brilliant.  The lead actors are all top notch and the supporting actors are all good too.

Eric Starkey is perfectly cast as Randall.  His expressions and reactions to his loved ones coming unglued around him are flawless visual comedy.  Understated, deadpan visual comedy like this has got to be difficult, but he makes it look easy.

Topher Owen, playing Randall's loser friend Jay deserves special mention.  He plays the wild-man counterpoint to Randall with style and a surprising amount of finesse.

3.  The musical score is simply genius.  Acoustic guitar and whistling seems strange, but It sets an upbeat tone without overpowering the movie.  As the tone of the movie changes, the music reinforces the mood perfectly.

4.  The directing and editing are both excellent.  Scenes are laid out well and the flow is coherent.  The timing is perfect and the attention to detail is excellent.  The furniture, the sets, and even the costumes are noteworthy.  I intend to watch any other movie I can find directed by Nick Lawrence.

I recommend this movie highly",1358553600,,2649,4.909502262443439
8498889,4,B006IUU2EK,"This is a good movie and give it 4 out of 5 stars for the great acting and plot, since I only reserve my 5 stars for outstanding and great films.

-The one thing I like is that the DVD comes in a paper sleeve and it's only movie itself and no extras, hence the ""Basic Edition."" The low price for this movie makes up for the fact that it does not come in a plastic DVD case and it does not have any extras which I never watch anyway. More independent movies should go this route since more people are willing to pay a lower price and this will increase the availability to watch a film that they would normally not be able to watch.",1355270400,,631,4.007936507936508
8498890,4,B006IUU2EK,This is an excellently paced movie that doesn't feel low budget.  What seems to be a simple movie proves to be enjoyably complex.  The acting and dialogue were great. I identified with each character and laughed out loud.  I'm very impressed and hope to see more from these producers.,1338422400,,284,4.755102040816326
8498891,5,B006IUU2EK,"Lots of heart, lots of humour.  If only the big budget Hollywood movies could take a cue from this little gem.  Great performances all around and excellent music on the soundtrack.  Just goes to show you that you don't need a big budget or big stars to tell an entertaining and heartfelt story.  This movie has made the rounds at a few film festivals and is now available for purchase or you can view it for free on Youtube.

I highly recommend it!",1324339200,2,448,4.349397590361446
