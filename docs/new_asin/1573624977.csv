194607,5,1573624977,"Good 70's nostalgia movie.  It seems that Gabe would not be suited for this type of movie, but he pulls it off without a hitch.",1374019200,,127,4.08
194608,3,1573624977,"The plot is simple, but really not to realistic.  The acting is good to fair.  In short it was OK doing about all it could with the writing",1370649600,,139,3.9285714285714284
194609,5,1573624977,This is a great movie.  Gabe Kaplan was really a comedic talent and this movie has a variety a hilarious parts.  Plus one of the main stars is Bernard King who was recently named to the Basketball hall of fame.  Check it out!,1369180800,2,225,4.186046511627907
194610,5,1573624977,"I saw this movie on t.v. when I was about 10 years old, and was moved to stomach butterfly excitement to see all of those African-American men and woman playing the lead in such a fun-filled movie. What was a thrill to me was being able to see the first glimpses of love and affection by an black couple on t.v. I have been trying to remember the name of this movie for years. All I could remember was the bedroom scene between D.C. and Swish, as Harold Sylvester, who plays D.C. plays this cute game with Swish before letting ""her"" know his true feelings and I quote ""I am crazy about you baby"" and that he knew that Swish was indeed a woman. Finally, their feelings of new love could grow. That part of the storyline was never really developed, but I would love for some director or producer to remake this movie and expand this love story. I guess that back in 1979 when the movie first came out in the theaters that black love on the big screen was not readily promoted, but today it would be nice to take this movie to the next level. I had goose bumps then and it still gives me goose bumps now. Besides my second favorite movie ""Mahogany"" with Dianne Ross and Billy Dee Williams, I will always have fond memories of this movie. I am so happy that time and the talents of human kind has provided all of us the opportunity to find and view old movies that we may have forgotten the titles to or most of the details, but our hearts will always have a special place for the moment and time when we once were kids and innocent.",1273536000,5,1529,4.221843003412969
194611,4,1573624977,"I always thought this story line was original, but now that I have seen ""Glory Road"" I am embarrassed to admit, I am not as well versed on college basketball history and can see where its genisis came from.  So this movie is now the 2nd best basketball movie I have ever seen.",1153094400,,276,4.2075471698113205
194612,2,1573624977,"this was a Light-Hearted Film that was dealing with some subjects but this Film kinda is a lightweight take on TV's ""White Shadow"".still it's Ok in spots.",1045353600,,154,4.7407407407407405
194613,5,1573624977,"I watched this move last night 3/12/02 on TBS and just had to write a review for this movie.  I saw FAST BREAK when I was 10 years old with my dad, it was funny then, and it is still just as funny 22 years later.  If you haven't seen this movie see it.  Gabe Kaplan takes 4 inner city basketball players to Nevada, and finds one brute football player to make the fifth man, and a bunch of semi ok players, and turns them into one of the powerhouses of the smaller college confrences.  The games they play are fun and exciting to watch.  One of the funniest parts of the film is the bag of Marijuana and what they have to do with it. The finaly is great with a classic game of David vs Goliath pitting Kaplans team against the mighty, powerful, and nationally ranked Nevada State. A classic movie for any Sports fan, heck any movie fan would love this movie.  Rent this movie, or buy this movie.  You won't be dissapointed.",1015977600,10,922,4.204545454545454
194614,3,1573624977,"This light-hearted story uses the basketball court of a small unknown southern university to depict the struggle of a group of talented individuals who come together to escape the poverty which surrounds them  and the society which has forgotten them. Taken from the inner-city, each  player, some reluctantly,  join Gabe Kaplin as he travels across the county  in an effort to produce something that the university has never had before,  a winning basketball team. Paid only for each game he wins, Kaplin's  original motivation seems to be a financial one.  As time passes however,  this set of individuals learn to overcome their differences to become a  winning team... both on and off the court.  In short a simplistic, enjoyable,  and romantic comedy.",961286400,7,756,5.114754098360656

194638,3,1573624977,"Gave Kaplan, seems to be better in his old sitcom when he was a teacher.  However, the movie had a really good story line but it seemed to be a tad slow.",1403308800,,153,3.78125

I thought it was a great sports movie then and seeing it again now I still think this is a great movie. It has some good laughs and basketball action unlike other sports movies this movie doesn't stray away from the game, but still inserts human drama and emotion in with it. Although this movie was made in 79 there is not a lot that dates the movie with except if you notice on a couple times you notice a typewriter where now you would see a computer. If you are debating about watching this movie give it a chance it is worth it.",1478217600,,615,4.090909090909091
