I show it to my students because when you describe the Holocaust to them, they can't wrap their minds around what you are talking about until they see it first hand.  I only show it to the older students' class.  But I think it is necessary to show it because it is just words on a page until you see the people who endured this Hell.  Not for really small children.",1266019200,,393,4.2
8179255,5,B000NLS6XY,"An excellent reminder of just how ruthless, racist, and complacent a countries people can become when they follow someone who promises EVERYTHING but secretly has an agenda of his own.  A must see for all present day political followers now that we have been declared a non-christian country by a governmental leadership even more powerful than Hitlers'.",1239321600,2,354,5.2105263157894735
