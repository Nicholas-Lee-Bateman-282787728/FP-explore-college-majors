8689326,2,B00PULRJCQ,"Contains midpoint explanation of background.

The Waiter (Jason Konopisos writer/director/Cinematography/producer...i.e. he owns it) is a nameless person who works for a nameless company as a courier and hitman. He is a bit of a sociopath with the personality of a fish. We discover the background for the film about half way through as a ""once upon a time"" story. It is heavy into conspiracy theories that the govt./Russian mafia/ energy companies/Arabs were all involved in unrest in the Middle East and that one thing (9-11?). The middle of the film pauses for a long boring philosophical narration to help us go to sleep. Yes we define ourselves by our name and occupation, just like medieval times. We work for people doing jobs that are beneath them. And we move but are motionless. I was really bored with the paranoid mind of Jason Konopisos.

The film has some avant-garde elements and has won numerous indie awards. Go figure.

8689329,1,B00PULRJCQ,"Bad acting, bad lighting, just plain bad...plays like a high school project. Don't waste your time or money.",1422921600,4,108,5.055555555555555
8689330,1,B00PULRJCQ,"Nice opening architectural photography. Great 60's retro style movie poster. Very handsome lead. Credits feature actor Charles Durning; Mr. Durning's a grand old man of the movies, one of those legendary character actors who can carry any movie. But probably even Charles Durning couldn't carry this one. Sadly, because writing and directing were so bad (which of course tend to make even good actors look bad) I couldn't watch beyond the first few minutes, like the first 4 scenes or so. So I missed what may have been another excellent performance by one of the late greats.

Because I'm devoted to indie cinema, all genres, and believe in cutting non-Hollywood movies stacks and stacks of slack, I want to mention here that deciding not to watch any film completely through --no matter who the director or star or writer is-- is a choice I almost never make.

I should've tweaked to the fact that this film was written, directed, produced, and executive-produced AND starred the same guy.",1422576000,7,991,4.92814371257485
