4212311,5,B003VWDK06,"there's so much to say about this masterpiece it's hard to begin. with the exceptions of mickey rourke, bruce willis and arnold schwarzenegger, every actor has at least 1 showdown with another. this is truely an action movie of 1980's caliber with exaggerated muzzle flashes and huge explosions and bad one liners. great movie. go see it relive the glory days of the 1980's and leave the kids at home for this. ok mr. stallone let's see another mission for your crew.",1281657600,4,467,4.7073170731707314
4212312,5,B003VWDK06,"Lofty expectations are rarely met.  The Expendables is one of those unusual occasions in which expectations are not only met, but they are exceeded.  This is pantheon level action, a truly guy's guy movie, a knock-down drag-out, butt kicking, action extravaganza that pays homage to the awesome battles and ridiculous body counts of 80s action flicks.  There has been a dearth of traditional action films and heroes over the past two decades, but the old guys get together with some new blood to retake the title.

Speaking of the awesome battles, they are split into four definite specialties: guns, fighting, knives, explosions.  Last first, the explosions are incredible.  Absolutely everything blows up; it's as if gas lines ran throughout every set piece on the film.  Half way through the movie I began to visualize mighty pillars of the villain's estate as massive sticks of dynamite.  The knife throwing is thankfully more than a novelty, as roughly 20 enemies on the Caribbean island of Vilena get gutted, beheaded, and/or eviscerated.  With this cast, battles are guaranteed.  Well, it's MUCH more than expected, much more realistic than anticipated, so real that Stallone had to have emergency surgery on his back after Austin throws him into a brick wall (you'll know the scene when you see it).  Last but not least, the gun-play.  Put simply, this is a Waco stock-piling, NRA wet dream.  Thousands of bullets carve bodies apart like Commando on steroids.  No less than five times did I lean forward, wide-eyed saying ""F*** yeah!""  Turn the action up to eleven, folks.  If you don't like this movie, check your pulse.

The ensemble cast is everything you'd expect.  Stallone leads a group of mercenaries consisting of Jet Li, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Dolph Lundgren, and Jason Statham who are hired by an undercover CIA agent (Bruce Willis) to ostensibly remove a dictator/general and his rogue CIA agent funding.  Throw a beautiful woman who needs saving into the mix and you have enough plot, and enough reason, to fly a jet into a small port town and spray down twenty or so soldiers before lighting another couple dozen on fire with jet fuel...for starters.

Go into this tabula rasa, looking for minimal plot and sub-par dialogue.  Who cares?  Negotiate with hollow point is what I say.  Compromise with C4.  Adrenaline from beginning to end.  Expect John Matrix to kill without discretion, Rocky to battle Ivan Drago, Jet Li to kick everyone within roundhouse radius, Randy Couture and Stone Cold Steve Austin to dish out body slams like herpes, Jason Statham to trump his own Transporter movies, Terry Crews to blow everything up (p-p-p-p-p-p-power!), and just appreciate that Arnold and Willis are on board for the cameo, the camaraderie, and the yippee-ki-yay...(you know the rest)!!  It's that good.

Honestly, this is the best action movie I've seen in twenty years.  I could write a 50-page thesis on various subtleties I enjoyed.  The only negatives are the absence of Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme (both were offered parts), and some of the action was too choppy (think thirty straight one-second bursts).  Both easily overlooked.  However, unless you go in expecting Citizen Kane (if you do, it's your fault), this epic crowd pleaser should leave you cheering.",1281657600,5,3300,5.0220994475138125
4212313,4,B003VWDK06,"When I was a kid, heroes were larger than life. They still are today only with just one exception albeit a pretty significant one... in those days, Men were Men. They weren't pretty but they exuded their God-given male born testosterone with every ounce of testicular sweat dripping on celluloid. For a boy growing up in the 80's they were the male role-models and father figures that inspired impressionable pre-adolescent boys into shaping their adult manhoods. Those were the days of yore.

The Expendables isn't a great film by any stretch of the imagination but it knows exactly what it is trying to be and doesn't pull any punches. It tries to be the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magnificent-Seven/dp/B000BX0VRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magnificent Seven</a>&nbsp;of the modern action movie but doesn't quite hit its mark. It's more like the Magnificent Four and a Half (Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Austin, and Li). The rest of the ensemble more or less being, ahem... expendable. My friend and I once had a similar idea for a movie that would pit all of our favorite 80's action stars into one no-holds-barred-royal-rumble-of-epic-manliness which we appropriately called ""Cajones"" but that was back in the mid-90's when there was still a chance to see most of these larger-than-life-nut-swingers together onscreen in their prime. The fact that Stallone, now 64, can prove that he still has what it takes and show the younger generations how to make an action movie proper after two successful comebacks with his acclaimed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-Balboa/dp/B000N3AXQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky Balboa</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo/dp/B003KV3E36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo </a>&nbsp;is a testament that there is still not only a demand but a primal need for REAL movie star icons like Stallone that are legends who defy their generation and age.

There is only one thing you need to know about the paint-by-numbers plot and that is this: These titans of manliness have all come here to chew bubble-gum and kick ass, and there is a whole lotta bubble-gum to go around. When the blood and guts start flying it makes Peckinpah look like Walt Disney. If that is the kind of movie you are expecting to see you won't be disappointed. Perhaps the biggest fault with The Expendables is that it never quite lives up to itself. Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo feels like it was thrown in just for the sake of having the three biggest 80's action icons together at last onscreen for a Hard Rock Cafe Kodak moment. It just feels like 'The Guvinator' shows up to give his quick endorsement before going back to the office. Fortunately Sly has much better things to do these days than bankrupting the state of Culifornia. I was never particularly a fan of so-called ""professional"" wrestling for all of its phoniness so guys like Stone Cold Steve Austin never really appealed to me but I'll take him and UFC's Randy Couture any day over any so-called leading male action star in Hollywood today just on sheer testosterone levels alone. At least Mickey Rourke showed that not all of professional wrestling is fake with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wrestler/dp/B001TOD9VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wrestler</a>"" but ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man-2/dp/B0021L8V1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man 2</a>"" hardly qualifies him as a bona fide action-star, more like Harley Davidson without the Marlboro Man. One look at his fugly face and you can see that his days of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-1-2-Weeks/dp/0792838912/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9 1/2 Weeks</a>"" with the ladies are long over. Jason Statham is apparently the most masculine male action star Hollywood currently has to offer up and that's not saying too much with a resume consisting of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lock-Stock-and-Two-Smoking-Barrels/dp/B002QZ2DPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels </a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crank/dp/B000KHX73U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crank</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B000ICLRIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>"" series but I guess baldness apparently qualifies him in the testosterone brigade along with Bruce Willis whose days of headlining as an action star were washed up with the last ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000W4HIY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>."" The truly expendable were those 80's action icons who didn't quite make the cut like Chuck Norris who for whatever reason was unable to attend Sly's little shindig. As a kid I probably watched every action film that Chuck starred in like ""The Octagon,"" ""Good Guys Wear Black,"" ""Lone Wolf McQuade"" and ""A Force of One."" You can't think of the 80's without bringing up Chuck Norris, or the poseurs like Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal, all of whom are conspicuously MIA. Apparently Van Dammage was offered a part but he thought the script should have catered to his ego as well as a bigger paycheck so Sly made his part ""Expendable.""

The Expendables is a fun salute to the 80's and a throwback to the days when action films weren't trying to be politically correct and were all about blowing stuff up, flexing their muscles, delivering the one-liners, kicking ass and looking cool. To that end, The Expendables is a blast, but not a slam dunk. It's worth a matinee out of pure sake of nostalgia or a rental. If The Expendables accomplishes one thing it should be this: To send a message to the studios that there is a hunger for masculine male action icons who are on the endangered species list and to ensure their survival in the 21st century which has been corrupted by forgettable momma's boys and blood sucking vampires of the Twilight generation.",1281657600,102,6219,6.080865603644647
4212314,4,B003VWDK06,"Oh yeah!  This ain't no bingo parlor, the old folks home is exploding with a vengenance!  Even though they've got more arthritis and wrinkles now than muscles, the geriatric gods of cinema all unite for a back-breakin', hip-dislocatin', memory-erasin', braindead action-packed thrill ride.

Sly busts his old buddies out of the cocoon with a bang.  Of course most of their screen time is handicapped by their astronomical pricetags.  Still it was fun to see them all make an appearance in one flick.  The writing does feel pretty rushed, the story is incoherent and predictable...but who cares?  This is all about the bullets, the booms, and bad guys getting killed by all our ancient heroes.

Sly and Stratham lead a pack of good-hearted mercenaries ready to put their life on the line for some cold hard cash.  One of their covert missions lead them down to South America to take out a ruthless dictator.  The job seems a little too tough for them but of course a hot chick makes them reconsider.  The odds are pretty insurmountable, but that doesn't matter for this pack of macho men.  Time to grab the dentures and go save a third world country.

Willis and Swartzenegger have very small roles, just a few minutes of screen time.  Li, Lungren, Couture, Crews, and Rourke get a few more moments in the spotlight.  But Stallone and Stratham dominate the action here.  Lots of flying daggers and stuff getting blown up.  Some CGI moments do look kinda fake, but not too horribly bad.  There are definitely some gruesome, eye-popping deaths that will get your blood flowing.

Never a dull moment here.  This has to be the greatest action star ensemble of all time, hands down.  If you're looking for the blockbuster event of the summer, it all Depends on The Expendables!  (3.5 stars)",1281657600,3,1784,4.780327868852459
4212315,2,B003VWDK06,"All of the trailers and TV spots have given people the idea that The Expendables  unites as many of the biggest action film stars in one film and promises to be one of the bloodiest and explosive films in recent memory. So to expect strong writing or a coherent story in a film like this would just be absurd, so I thought that expecting an entertaining action film and nothing more would fit the mold perfectly. Somehow the film still managed to be an out of control mess.

The writing was cringe-worthy. It felt like we were thrown into a film that had already established a back story, but maybe that's what they were going for since most of these actors have action films that they're associated with. The dialogue will probably make you groan at how corny it is at times. If Mickey Rourke's speech about putting a Charlotte's Web tattoo on Jason Statham's ""perfect, round head"" wasn't improvised, then that is really disappointing as Rourke seemed to struggle on spitting the words out during that scene. The Expendables certainly felt like it filmed all the big action sequences first and then tried to throw together a script and a story at the last minute. One of the most humorous aspects of the film was the fact that it had to make a big deal about Steve Austin's character not having any objections to roughing up women when he was accused of abusing them in real life.

With this many stars in the film, you can probably guess that it isn't very well balanced. Getting all of these action stars in one film is certainly an achievement, but most of them don't have much screen time. The first half of the film seems to be very Jason Statham heavy while the rest of the film is mostly Stallone. Jet Li and Mickey Rourke have a few scenes where they stick out while Dolph Lundgren seems to sit on the sidelines for most of the film. If you're going into this film expecting a larger role from someone who isn't in this paragraph, then you'll probably be disappointed due to how small their role really is.

The film is capable of delivering some bone-crunching and blood soaked fight sequences in addition to an incredible amount of explosions that would even make Michael Bay contemplate whether or not he's had this much destruction in one film. Some of the ways that people die in the film are gloriously gruesome while the film shines brightest during the scenes where Barney's team is too busy fighting to say much of anything. Most of the action scenes in Vilena, the car chase that ends with the fight between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren, and the finale of the film are all deliciously explosive, fast paced, and hit hard enough to satisfy most action film fans.

The Expendables is poorly written and rather brainless, but is capable of giving its audience exactly what it advertised and that's deliver one of the loudest action films ever that features quite possibly the greatest gathering of action stars in any film. If you're somehow able to ignore the disconnected storyline and stupefyingly simple dialogue, then you'll probably be able to enjoy the clutter of explosive and fast paced action.",1281484800,6,3116,4.647912885662432

Later when the Dc came out was utterly blown away by how much better the movie was. The change in the music just added something to the movie it was missing and made it even more bad A** than it already was.  The changed scene with Tool just added even more drama to an already great movie.  Recently saw a version on television and it was awful how bad it had been chopped up.  This version of the movie is the only version to own, and the best version.

Pity stallone didn't do the same thing with the sequels to this. Another great addition to this version is the documentary on the making of the movie and the hell they all went thru making it and seems to explain why stallone hasn't chosen to direct any of the sequels.",1522972800,,832,4.18125

But there's not gimmick here and its really doing the movie a disservice.  If I had to pin down the problem its that the opposition is as generic as it gets.  The hero's are interesting but they're not given anything interesting to do other than just blow up fodder enemies in a standard location.  What if they were fighting robots or ninjas or hell maybe the main villain killed Stallone's dog.  Stallone was in Demolition man with Snipes doing all sorts of fun set pieces and a goofy world.  Mickey Rourke fought Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dennis Rodman on a mine field with a tiger in Double Team.  Jet Li  fought himself across multiple universes in The One.  Nothing as cool as any of that happens in the Expendables, not even close.

The new intro, ""We are the ghosts..."" was cheesy as hell and the music added over top of some of the great scenes was so over the top cheesy and detracted from the scenes. Seriously... who adds rock music over the climax explosion of guns and fighting? It was great without it! Music is supposed to enhance and fill empty air but when the automatic shotgun is going off and all you hear is cheesy anthem rock it's just sad.

Aside from that the movie is still good overall. If you took out the stupid intro poem and the added music it's gain 2 stars.",1468368000,2,761,4.141891891891892

They make references to each other's previous action movies that are really funny. It's also has plenty of action. And the repartee between the men is great. They are asked to overthrow a dictator in a small country, but find out he's not the real bad guy. So it has a good story line besides all the action. I really enjoyed it, and watch it every two or three months. We'll sit and watch all three of the Expendables in a row. It makes for a great Saturday or Sunday afternoon and evening.

Have seen before and the Blu Ray is worth getting if only for the extended cut,, now have all 3 in BluRay collection.

Personally the tongue in cheek humor of these actors, some have done action movies for 20+ years, who are comfortable enough at their position in Hollywood to poke fun at themselves.  Story is plausible and a good way to spend a couple of hours.",1461456000,,715,4.469230769230769

4212577,4,B003VWDK06,"Released in 2010, The Expendables stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a group of mercenary veterans who are hired by the CIA to do their dirty work. In this case their mission is to assassinate the merciless dictator of a small South American island. A scouting expedition to the island by Barney and his right-hand man (Jason Statham) brings them into contact with local rebel Sandra (Giselle Iti) who turns out to be the dictators daughter. Barney later attempts a suicidal rescue mission with his so-called Expendables. Eric Roberts is on hand as the main villain while Charisma Carpenter has a small role.

This was a great way to get all those action stars from the 80s & 90s together for a fun action flick that balances quasi-seriousness with amusing moments and over-the-top action scenes. With just a little more effort and depth this coulda been great, but it works well as it is. Uber-fans of those old action movies will like it even more than I did.

The film runs 103 minutes and was shot in Louisiana, Los Angeles and Brazil.

There is a cameo from  Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. His partner from Rocky IV, Dolph Lundgren, plays the part of a team member who gets hooked on drugs and betrays them. The plot is solid, the movie is action-filled. Mickey Rourke plays a very interesting character that, though he is not a present team member, adds character to the mix. Stallone seems to have established a ""rebirth"" on his career, now that the ""Rocky"" theme is over.

Lot's of gunfire, explosion, violence, and big names.  The action is just as cartoonish(and I mean that in a good way) and over the top, AND well done, as you'd expect.  The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed, pretty much a must for a Jason Statham movie.
  What surprised me was the dialogue. The banter between Sallone and Statham is wittty, clever, and at times, hilarious.  There's a scene featuring the two of them done strictly using facial expressions - not a single word of dialogue.  Yet it was brilliantly funny - and that one, single facial expression by Stallone gave me a whole new respect for the man.  This guy has been hiding some GREAT comedy chops from us all these years.  Speaking of inside jokes, there's no shortage of them here, played straight, but if you're paying attention, you'll laugh your butt off.",1439596800,2,1003,4.6477272727272725

And Sly Stallone looked good and then better and better by the third movie. I like how they finally put some light white streaks in his hair. It looked so much better on him than all-jet black hair. I always liked him and his movies, and he is still hot. I liked Arnold in the third movie also. Harrison Ford still rocked. And Antonio Banderas is definitely still hot, and funny!

Some movies are geared towards producing Oscar winning performances & some are made to entertain.  The Expendables is the later to be sure!  If you want to be a arm chair critic go for it, but this movie succeeds at its goal & that's to provide action & fun with a few laughs!  I predict a sequel & as a matter of fact with this kind of formulated film I can see a franchise capable of rivaling James Bond!  This movie is no where as serious as the recent Bond films but it is a lot of fun.  And if you are a arm chair critic that wants to bash the acting in this film do it in front of the cast!!!LMAO!!!  These are some real tough guys Mickey Rourke spent some time in the Boxing Ring, Randy Couture is a living legend in the world of M.M.A.  And Stallone did so many Rocky movies at one time his trainer said he was good enough to be ranked in the top 5 of his weight class.

and he comes back- all forgiven. Cured of ""using""-?  It seems his character was going to be eliminated from the movie,
but someone decided to ""bring him back.""
Albatross footage pretty good.
But WHY is C.I.A. ALWAYS A SCAPEGOAT FOR HELLYWOOD?
No humans can take the beatings any of these men take in these movies.
But, good ""escapism.""  Don't try ANY of this one your own, though!  We did it in Nicaragua, but we were kind of ""used to it.""
The large Bowie-style knife is by Gill Hibben,  designed after the real one owned by a close friend of mine in Hellywood. The large Bowie used by Lundgren is taken from one believed to be owned by Col. James Bowie. I have a model of this knife. MASSIVE!
These fellows never run out of ammo, though.
Mickey Rourke's performance is SUPER!  His character ""Tool,"" is really something. Watch for the scene where he tells ""Barney"" about how he could have saved a woman from suicide. Great acting.
It's a weird, but REAL feeling to be ""Expendable."" The REALITY can keep you awake at night, believe me.",1427328000,,1134,4.645

Expendables is the type of movie where actors go to die. I don't mean in the actual movie but career wise. This movie is the only box office movie I know that can run without having any script to operate on much like a porno.

It's a long shoot'em up movie without talent, direction, story, nor any cool factor. From Stallone to Li the acting ensemble is an utter disaster. The action is campy and breaks no boundaries other than accomplishing absolute lameness.",1424131200,,604,4.583333333333333

4212867,2,B003VWDK06,"I really wanted to like this because all the old school actors were in this. I think it would of been amazing if someone else wrote the script. The lines to me were horrible. I could tell it was written by Stallone.
Example of Bad lines-
:::::Spoiler:::::
Cool Boyfriend goes to see girlfriend (who he has not seen in a while) and finds her with bad boyfriend.
Cool boyfriend leaves all mad.
Later he finds girlfriend all beat up.
Then you see Cool boyfriend with his girl on the back of his bike(no words exchanged)
They ride up to a basketball court where bad boyfriend is playing basketball with neighborhood gang.
Cool Boyfriend then beats bad boyfriend with his motorcycle helmet almost killing him as girlfriend watches.
Cool boyfriend and girlfriend get on motorcycle.
Cool boyfriend says 'See you shouldn't have left me.'
She looks at him and gets on his bike.
He revs bike and drives off really fast

Are you kidding me??? ""See you shouldn't have left me?"" Really? Be forewarn I am a woman and I was laughing so hard when I heard him say this.
Reality check. First off, a battered girl probably does not want to go see you bash a guys head into the cement with your helmet. and then be told 'See you shouldn't have left me'. I get what Stallone was trying to say in the script which was 'I am a good guy I can protect you.' but there are other ways to show that and sometimes words are not even necessary. If I just saw a guy bash some dudes head into the cement on my behalf I don't think he would need to say anything at all. Although in reality I think I would appreciate if he not take me to see all that blood shed. Some of the lines in this movie were just plain stupid. Which made me sad because there are so many amazing actors in this film. And I liked the title Expendables -because I think Hollywood has treated a lot of actors as expendable. Meaning they stopped giving all the good actors scripts and kept giving the scripts to bad actors. Hollywood keeps neglecting a lot of great actors. They should treat its actors like a garden. Keep watering them(giving them scripts) and watch them grow. Bruce Willis, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson....These people brought us amazing films. Why not keep investing in them. Anyways...This is a dude film unless your a dude with brains then this film is not for you. Only muscle heads will like this.

4212888,4,B003VWDK06,"In 2010, Sylvester Stallone has the idea to take every current and former action star, and put them into a series of movies. The goal was to create the biggest, wildest, most expensive action movies ever made, and have them feature every big name action star from the past 30 years. The studio was so much behind the idea, that not only did they give Stallone a huge budget, but they also approved a sequel, before the first film was even in theaters. It took me 5 years to watch this movie, because I honestly didn't think it was going to work. There is an old saying about having too many cooks in the kitchen, and while trying to include everyone was admirable, I couldn't imagine it working, I was wrong. Stallone leads a freelance para-military organization known as the expendables. These guys work for the highest bidder and do things the government can't. In the first installment of the now billion dollar franchise, the expendables are tasked with stopping a coup on a Caribbean island. If the rival organization takes control, the island would be the largest manufacture of illegal narcotics in the world, and would be impossible to stop, enter the expendables. Sylvester Stallone may be a senior citizen now and still somewhat hard to understand, but when it comes to action movies, you'd be hard pressed to find a better leader. His second in command is currently the largest action star in the world, Jason Statham. Even after seeing hundreds of action movies, including most of Statham's, the guy continues to impress me at every turn. All the strange accents make for an interesting mix of dialogue, but that aside, the story is good, the fight scenes are better, and the special effects are amazing. The Expendables was billed as THE action film to see and it does not disappoint.",1420502400,,1797,4.744408945686901

The film was advertised as a throwback to action movies of the 80's and 90's. The actions scenes were definitely huge and excessively violent. No question that action film lovers will definitely enjoy and will be enormously entertained watching this movie. Too bad that despite the talent involved,the film came out to be just ordinary for there is nothing really new or groundbreaking.

4212948,1,B003VWDK06,"This is a very dark film--and by that I mean dark as in poorly lit.  Most of the film takes place at night or in dark places and it's very difficult to follow what's happening much of the time.  Maybe the film comes across better in a darkened theater on a big screen, but on my big screen television in my darkened living room I had a hard time seeing who was doing what to whom.  Much of the time I had to rely on what I was hearing.  I could have almost gotten the gist of the action by foregoing trying to watch this film and just listening to the audio track.  And there's not much to warrant doing that.

  ""The Expendables"" is your run-of-the-mill B grade action plot with nothing new to offer.  It could have been a fun diversion if you could see what was going on.  Sure, there are plenty of explosions, bursts of fire, flying fists, gunshots, and all the other cliches of action films of this ilk.  Too bad they didn't apply more of the budget to better lighting so audiences could see all of it better.

  The characters are not especially likable, the dialogue is weak--it seems almost improvised at times, and the story is rather disjointed with a mishmash of irrelevant stuff thrown in the mix to presumably reveal more character or merely add more action.  The car chases are unremarkable and somewhat hard to follow as are the fighting scenes.

  As with many action films this one relies on fast-moving camera sweeps, choppy editing, and a lot of standard sound effects.  Add to that a generic soundtrack that must have been used in dozens of other films.  Maybe this could be considered an attempt at Impressionism in film, not in the artistic sense, but in the sense that we get impressions of what is going on.

Not a film that I would recommend to anyone and it makes me wonder if I saw the same film as all of those who gave 4 and 5 star reviews.  Or maybe those folks just have different tastes than I do.  I just hope the follow-up films in the series were better than this one or at least better lit.",1418428800,,2025,4.327127659574468
