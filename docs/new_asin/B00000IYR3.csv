Bored Sexy housewife's older husband ignores her so she goes off and falls (almost) into the arms of the first guy who looks passionately in her direction.  The guy is an artist in so much as he has lots of glamorous girls around him who he seems to be trying to get them all their first big break into Pictures, Movies or whatever.  There is a twist and darker motivation in their affair but you can read that spoiler elsewhere.",1413504000,,469,4.306818181818182
7911734,4,B00000IYR3,"I taped this from cable in the 1990s and at the time I thought it was a phenomenal movie. carol plays a sexually frustrated housewife whose demented husband denies her love while foolishly playing head games with her.

She seeks out love and warmth from several men in this movie, including a sadistic artist who is more than what he appears. I won't go into too much on the plot save to say that this was a production that could have been better. Yet director Greg Dark holds his own with the material and I can honestly say that this is a movie I would enjoy seeing again.

I have not seen it on DVD but I plan to purchase it for my collection at some point. I can only hope that there are DVD extras on the disc. We shall see.

Probably by today's standards, Carnal Crimes might not seem like such a big deal but when I saw it on Cinemax in the ninety-two it was pretty hot stuff. Actually, I can still picture some of the scenes that managed to burn themselves into my memory.

Elise (Linda Carol) is a former model who is married to Stanley, (Rich Crater) an unattractive businessman, who can never seem to find the time for his beautiful blonde wife. In fact, he seems to be indifferent to her needs. This leads our restive housewife to seek adventure outside her home.

After visiting a photo exhibition by a handsome young photographer named Renny, (Martin Hewitt) she become enamored with him. The following day she goes to his studio in a warehouse area, only to find it locked with no one answering the doorbell.

Picture fine looking housewife mini-skirt and high heels decides to climb a fire-escape that had been locked I the down position. As she gets to the second floor she peers into a dirty window and sees Renny snapping pictures of Mia, (Yvette Nelson) a sexy, scantily clad subject in an increasingly suggestive way. All of a sudden, Elise is attacked by a vagrant who had been sleeping one off.  (the reason the fire-escape had been locked in place) She manages to fight him off but during the struggle breaks the window and cuts her hand. Renny's attention is drawn to the noise from the cracking window, lets Elise in and attends to her cut for a short time before beginning to snap her picture as well getting more and more friendly as he goes.

The next scene is the one that is burned in my mind. The camera moves to a ceiling shot showing Renny, on his knees, screwing the now naked Elise on her back, while Mia, kisses, caresses and fondles them both.

If my memory serves me there are two or three other good sex scenes involving Elise, including one in a bakery.

Conclusion

Since this was obviously an erotic movie, I haven't touched much on the underlying plot, which is weak. Apparently Stanley is something of a pervert and his wife's affair with Renny was set up by Stanley, pictures of which were given to him. I found this to be a stretch, wondering how Stanley would know whether Elise would go for Renny. Still with its faults, I still found Canal Crimes to be a compelling movie. Final rating 3.65 stars.",1174953600,2,2683,4.562761506276151
7911736,2,B00000IYR3,"Linda Carol plays the wife of a pudgy lawyer who shows no interest at all in his sexy wife. She decides to turn the tables by having an affair with mysterious, seductive photographer Martin Hewitt. Before too long, this heated affair is not what it seems, as Hewitt appears to have a dark side which could lead to a fatal conclusion. Stiff acting, horrible writing, and contrived directing all add up to one extremely boring flick. While the film does feature rather hot sex scenes (most films of this sort do), it can not compensate for much else. Julie Strain is featured in a 5 minute cameo in a Japanese restaurant bathroom, coupled with Hewitt in a rather graphic, yet amazingly hot sex scene--which earns this film its second star. Otherwise, skip it.",1161820800,,757,4.6992481203007515
