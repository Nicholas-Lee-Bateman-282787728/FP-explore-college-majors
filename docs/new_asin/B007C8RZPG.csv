5076953,1,B007C8RZPG,"I made the mistake of buying this at Target, not knowing it was from the same group that produced the dud ""America's National Treasures"". These are unquestionably the worst purchases I've ever made. The other reviewers are spot-on. Don't waste your time, and don't be fooled by the beautiful images on the cover.",1335657600,27,312,4.90566037735849
5076954,1,B007C8RZPG,"See the Eiffel Tower on the cover? Well good luck finding it during any of this video. I thought this would be a travel overview of some of the natural and human made sights in France and Italy. Instead it is a ridiculously overly detailed explanation of several architectural features in a few cities. Rome? Nothing! Paris? Nothing! On top of it, they seemed to have found two women to ""narrate"" who have been lobotomized and taken several ambien. They could not possibly speak more slowly or in more of a monotone.  Amazon should stop selling this item or at least provide an accurate description of what exactly it is. I managed to torturously get through maybe 1/4 of it, and watched it on fast forward some. Since none of the areas on my impending trip to Rome and Paris were included, even that was not relevant to me. Expect to see any other sites such as Venice, Florence, or Naples, well don't look here. I returned it due to the false advertising. Single worst DVD or blu-ray purchase I have ever made.",1334707200,39,1012,4.530054644808743
5076955,2,B007C8RZPG,"Beautiful Planet - France & Italy arrived at my door full of promise. I love the blu-ray format, and a high definition film that captures the beauty of France and Italy had to be a sure bet. I've spent a lot of time visiting both countries, and I was looking forward to revisiting France and Italy, in the comfort of my home. I don't think I have ever spent a more boring 4 hours in all of my life. The limited geographic areas covered by the films, the inarticulate narrators, and the lack of stunning cinematography compel me to give this blu-ray 2 big thumbs down. I gave one star for just making the bloody film, and another star for effort, and the bargain basement price. Don't waste your time on these awful movies - Rick Steves has visited many of the same places on his PBS Show, and is far more enjoyable and effective in standard definition. If I have to hear the word proscenium pronounced ""pro-sheen-ium"" again - I'll scream.",1334016000,49,938,4.459302325581396
5076972,1,B007C8RZPG,"Not only is this a VERY BAD documentary, but it is also marketed with a cynical attempt to deceive the customer. FIRST: the first half purports to be about France, but it only covers a few cities in the south of France (no Paris!). It was obviously part of a bigger series of french city documentaries, but they only had access to the least interesting cities in the series. SECOND: The narration is boring and repetitious and the video is uninspired and spends way too much time panning and scanning the same images. THIRD: The audio has music in the background that is truly irritating. It seems that the producer's brother-in-law owns a synthesizer and volunteered to do the music for free. FOURTH: This blu-ray is purportedly 1080p. If it is, it must have been upconverted from a DVD source. There is no detail to the video. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such garbage.",1375056000,,875,4.651612903225806
5076973,1,B007C8RZPG,"The makers behind this Bluray are hoping to trick you into thinking you'll get something similar to BBC's Planet Earth. That is not the case, not even close.

I will start by saying this ""film"" has absolutely nothing good. Nothing about it is passable as a ""film"" of this nature.

Cons:
-not in HD. The menu and the cover of the bluray are the only things in HD
-the narrator is the most boring, uninteresting, and unmotivated voice-over I've ever heard in my life
-the places you ""visit"" aren't even places you'd want to see
-cheap video graphics
-very long when it doesn't need to be
-the music is on the same level as elevator and porno music
-the cinematography is nearly non-existent. Most shots are static, don't move
-nothing is shown that seems natural. no people are ever shown, as if they kicked everyone out for ""filming""

I could go on and on. Bottom line: do not waste your time or money on this piece of regurgitated crap. The only reason I gave it a 1 star rating is because I couldn't give it a zero. If I could, I would give this product a negative number for a score.",1374969600,6,1085,4.388059701492537
5076974,1,B007C8RZPG,"I, too, made the mistake of buying this at Target yesterday.  I'll concur with the negative comments above:  it doesn't even look like it was filmed in HD, you don't get to see the Eiffel Tower or Venice at all (even though they're on the cover), and the cinematography and narration could both use significant improvement.  I'm going to add this company to Questar on my List Of Companies From Which I'll Never Again Buy Videos.",1374364800,,429,4.618421052631579
5076975,5,B007C8RZPG,I love these outdoors dvd's they are really good especially if you probably won't make it there kinda lets you feel like you are there,1372291200,2,134,4.4
5076976,1,B007C8RZPG,"As you can see from the other reviews, this product is mind numbingly dull. I thought surely it was done in the 80s or earlier, before they learned travel shows could be interesting. However, it claims to have been made in 2012. The narrators sound like they were told to speak in the most monotone voice they could as they drone on and on about the height and width of a wall. The camera slowly, slowly pans over the same wall for far too long.  Watching this felt like being back in high school when the teacher would put on this kind of video so she could grade papers. Thank goodness that this time I could turn it off. Do not waste your money on this awful, awful product.",1372032000,,677,4.248062015503876
5076977,1,B007C8RZPG,My mom just came home from a two week trip in Italy. I saw this dvd at Target and thought it would be a fun thing to watch with her - as she could relive her recent adventure with me. After the first ten minutes of listening and seeing nothing but Italian roofs (yes - like a roof on a house) we changed movies. The narrator was monotone and deathly boring to listen to. And the music sounded straight from an adult movie. Not recommended unless you're trying to fall asleep. Or laugh.,1371081600,,485,4.225806451612903
5076978,1,B007C8RZPG,"The is the worst piece at trash I have ever spent money on. Horrible video.  Giving this one star is an insult to those movies that deserve that rating, this video needs a new rating category:  0 stars.",1364083200,2,202,4.2894736842105265
5076979,1,B007C8RZPG,"I wish I could offer a review with substance - but that would belie the lack of content in this Blu-Ray disk.  The reviewer who said it was the most boring 4 hours they'd ever spent nailed that spot-on.  I learned about ""tourist attractions"" of which I'd never heard - and will never remember (nor do I want to) - and failed to see the most famous spots, including those depicted on the cover.  I picked it up because it promised gorgeous photography and was such a ""deal.""  Oh well, I guess it was a cheap-enough lesson to read reviews before laying out my money.",1362268800,,564,4.3428571428571425
5076980,1,B007C8RZPG,"I bought this at Target today for $5. What a waste of 5 bucks! It's all about ""buildings"" in some cities in these two countries. I've been to the Trulli houses in Alberobello. Maybe it went on too long FOR ME. Been to the Cinque Terra. They could have done a much better job. France? Nothing about Paris! Just a bunch of ""buildings"" in some French cities. And Bordeaux? Nothing about any vineyard, just the city.

Save the $5. Spend it on Visions of Italy (2004) or any of the other Visions videos.",1362268800,,498,4.354838709677419
5076981,1,B007C8RZPG,The cover has pictures of Paris and Venice. The cover is the closest the blu-ray comes to showing those two cities. It is an in-depth discussion (other reviews have shown just how boring and lengthy the discussions are) of a few cities. And those cities are not the most significant ones in the two countries. What a disappointment. The only redeeming factor of this blu-ray is that it was cheap.,1362182400,,396,4.671428571428572
5076992,1,B007C8RZPG,"how does one go about making france and italy boring and bland?  well, here's a master class.  there's really nothing more to be said than what has already been summed up in the other reviews. boring narrative, uninspired photography and poor video quality were huge disappointments.  if you're looking for something to convince you NOT to travel, this is the dvd for you.",1360022400,,372,4.873015873015873

Don't bother, if you are looking for quality tour information",1357862400,,142,4.72
5076994,2,B007C8RZPG,"Terrible ""documentary"". Major landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower are completely omitted in favor of dozens of shots of bland buildings and repeated generic locations. This video is 90% panning or still shots (in HD!) with small voice-over blurbs in between. There's maybe half an hour of material here stretched out over four. I think I enjoyed it as much as the narrator did.",1356739200,,376,4.890625
5076995,1,B007C8RZPG,This travel documentary was cheaply made. It consists of poorly shot video of tourist destinations in France and Italy combined with interviews with experts and tour guides. The video is ugly and the audio is worse. Don't waste your time or money.,1355961600,8,247,4.904761904761905
5076996,1,B007C8RZPG,"I bought mine at Target thinking of get a blue ray full of beautiful French and Italian images and some knowledge.
The narrator is so dry and monotone, she puts me to sleep. Background music is so boring that silence would be more exciting. This is a huge disservice to France and Italy.
I wish I bought 3 boring coffeehouse lattes instead! Too bad I can't get a refund on bad entertainment!",1353801600,7,391,4.444444444444445
5076997,5,B007C8RZPG,"When I watched this film, I felt as if I had been transported back to France and Italy...which is weird because I've never been there. The narration brought tears to my eyes as I could truly absorb the beauty that is Italy and France. I felt as if I could taste the creps and authentic pizza margherita. I cry every time I even think about the beauty of this movie....there I go again. It would be impossible for me to overemphasize how breathtaking this masterful work of cinema truly is.",1353369600,,489,4.444444444444445
5076998,1,B007C8RZPG,"I love travel films, and I never get tired of Rick Steves. So, after buying this film, I felt compelled to share a review. The film was a total disappointment! It's boring, uninspiring, and s-l-o-w... You won't recognize or be interested in any of the places they chose to film - through lots of gates, trees, and outside fences and with no people in sight... Lastly, the voice-over sounds like a European woman trying to make a textbook sound sexy while an easy-listening soundtrack plays in the background... Don't waste your money.",1352678400,8,534,4.815217391304348
5076999,1,B007C8RZPG,"It's basically a visual tour of the architecture and some of the art of several cities in each country, dropping a lot of names without connecting them sufficiently to either history or the architecture and art. The videos are tedious.",1345766400,2,235,4.9
5077000,1,B007C8RZPG,"Though I only spent $8 on this (from another vendor, not Amazon), it was still a waste of money.  The narration is monotone, the ""script"" is essentially the monotone narrator reading off sterile details (e.g., this building has 17 doors and 30 windows....45 steps lead up to this doorway....), and there are moments when one can view dirt/water stains on the camera lens as the camera scans across the skyline for panoramic shots.  Do not confuse this with the BBC's excellent ""Planet Earth"" series (which the packaging of this disappointing blu-ray mimics) - this is waste of time and money.",1338422400,12,592,4.91
5077001,2,B007C8RZPG,"I got this at Target for $7.00 thinking that at that price it could be pretty bad and still have value. Now I see it on Amazon for 4.99.

The packaging and title are compleatly misleading. This is a video about selected historical landmarks in the countries. The cover shows a widescreen view of Paris at sunset, but the disk does not show anything about Paris, rarely shows sweeping landscapes, and usually shows these places in the middle of the day when light is harshest.

The picture is sometimes soft, yielding a quality no better than DVD. A low frame rate per second means that panning is jerky. In Orange, some shots show a lot of dust on the lens. The commentary is mundane if not boring. The production went into far too much detail about a few landmarks, but you never learn anything about what these cities are like in general.

I'm giving this two stars instead of one because some shots are well composed and the interiors seems to be well done for dark historic buildings. Still, I would not recommend that  anyone buy this.",1336176000,5,1040,4.545454545454546
8514360,2,B007C8RZPG,"There are poorly done photos, and there is droning dialogue. The photos and dialogue start at the same time, but have nothing to do with each other. The dialogue will talk about one subject and the photos will be of something different. If I was posting this as a DVD about France and Italy, it would be only one star, which would be generous. But this DVD is EXCELLENT for going to sleep. When watching it, it has ALWAYS put me to sleep. The drone of the dialogue (no inflection at all) is great for insomnia. This DVD is invaluable for restless nights. I'm not being sarcastic. I'm very glad that I have this DVD.",1528416000,,615,4.356521739130435

It is probably the worst Blu ray ever made and definitely the worst one I've ever purchased.
It is NOT high high definition- it's worse than most regular DVDs and similar to what I recall from VHS video.  The color is washed out and at times weird reflections and dust on the camera lens are visible.  None of the shots of the sky show a blue sky, it's kind of a fuzzy monochromatic gray as if Europe had magically been transported to Oregon in Novermber.  I've been to Europe many times and it's never looked as ugly as it does in this Blu ray....even when it's raining.
The Blu ray consists mostly of a disjointed slide show of low resolution shots of buildings and slow motion panning shots of crumbling buildings, monuments and scenery.
The narration is insipid,  monotonous, pretentious and painfully repetetive and doesn't correspond in most instances to what it being shown.  Does anyone, and I mean anyone anywhere really care that some random statue of madonna in some random church in some random town weighs 4.3 tons???  I must confess that during the  Italy section, I kept having recurring fantasies about stuffing the narrators mouth with overcooked pasta until the insufferable droning stopped forever.
The ""music"" is akin to a low budget porn movie synthesizer soundtrack punctuated by abrupt almost schizophrenic changes - for example when interiors of churches are being shown the soundtrack switches from bad jazz to bad classical music then back to bad jazz, then back to bad classical music.  It's nauseating.
There is no editing to speak of..... transitions from one scene to  another abrupt and chaotic.  Zero cinematographic value.
I can't believe anything could be this bad.  I see that it is now selling used for as little as 46 cents, and it isn't even worth that much.  Other reviewers have commented that Paris and Venice - which are depicted on the box- are not even found on the Blu Ray.  I wouldn't know, I stopped watching after about 20 minutes.  The only way to watch this is to fast forward through it while doing something else (e.g. vacuming) and glance at the screen once and a while.

I honestly thought this was from the people who made Planet Earth, so I was expecting something amazing to watch, but I was horribly wrong. The narrators were horrible, the cinematography was okay, and the music (sounded like some cheap educational video music, you'd think they use come music related to the country).

8514367,1,B007C8RZPG,"You cant judge a DVD by its cover. The cover clearly shows Paris and Venice but the actual DVD did not visit either of these cities. I bought this Blu-Ray DVD as a gift to go with a new Blu-Ray player. I was thinking that it would showcase the beauty of our planet while showing the superior quality over a regular DVD. The footage is boring, the colors are washed out and not at all like the cover promises. It is almost like they took someone's home video and had a local person who speaks a little English narrate. There were parts where they kept saying the same thing over and over. I can't believe that this kind of video is available for purchase.
