8462442,5,B0058YPJU4,"Per usual, another rare, extremely well written show on network television has bitten the dust.  A wonderful cast, headed by Maria Bello, Aidan Quinn and Bryan F. O'Byrne, plus some of the best crime writing ever were not enough to save this excellent series from being axed by the incredible brains at NBC.  And they wonder why people have stopped watching network TV????  This is a prime example!",1461715200,,398,4.823529411764706
8462443,5,B0058YPJU4,Show was great and a great homage to the original Prime Suspect ( with Helen Mirren in the role). I ceased watching NBC shows subsequent to this cancellation as did many of my friends. NBC has zero writers and their news broadcasts and commentary is biased and worthless.,1440115200,,271,4.666666666666667
8462444,5,B0058YPJU4,LOVED THIS SHOW! HEARTBROKEN IT WAS CANCELLED!!!!!,1425686400,,50,6.285714285714286
8462445,1,B0058YPJU4,"Lovedthe series, but read the details on this item.  This is only the pilot episode and nothing more.  Not worth the price.",1418342400,,123,4.545454545454546
8462446,5,B0058YPJU4,"I agree with the other two people about what a great show Prime Suspect was. NBC had a hit, but unfortunately, was too stupid to know it. They make stupid decisions (The Today Show, Harry's Law)and then they wonder why their ratings are so low. In my opinion, the only shows on NBC worth watching now are Smash and Grimm. Two shows for a solid week, how pathetic for a network. Their own decisions have screwed them over, I only wish another network had picked up this great outstanding realistic cop show with some of the best acting I've ever seen. Guess I'll depend on other networks to provide me with entertainment.",1344124800,13,620,4.544642857142857
8462447,5,B0058YPJU4,"Maria Bello (who gives a very strong performance)and the rest of the cast of ""Prime Suspect"" bring a new view of law-enforcement to the small screen. The writers, cast, producers, and director ""hit the nail on the head"" with this show. So of course it was cancelled, after one season! Can't wait for the DVD to come out.",1337731200,15,320,4.5344827586206895
8462448,5,B0058YPJU4,"With so many terrible programs on television, it is beyond me why an intelligent, interesting drama like Prime Suspect has been dropped. The actors and the storylines were all excellent. After just 13 episodes, the network did not give this show a chance. If you like a crime show that makes you think, then this show is for you!",1337299200,21,329,4.593220338983051
