ABMP has a great video on performing hot stone massage safely that can be found on YouTube.",1500422400,,337,4.633333333333334

8239291,5,B0010XFC6S,"This video is a must when purchasing the hot stones and warmer from Amazon.  It definitely helps the amateur when wondering how to properly use the stones.  It was very detailed, did not rush through any important motions or methods and made the amateur Masseuse feel a bit better about creating the right atmosphere, using the correct techniques, and how to use the stones.  Care instructions were given in detail on how to care for the stones you purchase, and how each size stone can be used in the massage process.
I thoroughly enjoyed the video, as it gave me the knowledge I needed to use the stones as they were intended, and to practice the perfect massage.",1289779200,18,665,4.61864406779661
