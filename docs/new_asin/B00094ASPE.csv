I think it would be especially good for young girls to watch.",1222214400,,264,4.408163265306122
8232812,5,B00094ASPE,"Piano is the type of show that one could easily overlook. It excels at being incredibly normal. So you would think that it would merit an average grade. However, this show has a real wow factor for me. I think it is all of the little things that make up life so carefully collected and presented in a beautiful manner that give this show a real maturity. Piano is a bit like a mirror. Its down to earth simplicity quietly draws the viewer in. The appeal here is the accessibility of the characters. Any music student or girl of Miu's age can easily relate. This show is all about the little things in life, and sometimes you just need to set back and enjoy it.",1123459200,6,660,4.288
