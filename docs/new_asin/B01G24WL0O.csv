This is a true piece of rock & roll history. The story of George Harrison visiting America just a few months before the Beatle's invasion of 1964 is priceless. A true ""Beatles"" or ""George"" fan must watch this. Hang in there through the sometimes rough quality. The producer should be commended for having the foresight to collect these interviews before all those folks passed away. Despite what you learn from the annals of official rock and roll historians, Benton is the THE first place where Beatle records were being played with regularity before 1964. You have to buy the video to hear that story -- a big fan of this DVD.",1487462400,,796,4.817518248175182
8762072,2,B01G24WL0O,"The first disc is pretty lame (the city officials talking) except for when his sister shared her experiences, that was better.  And the video quality was not good.  Too much city officials & not enough George.  I got this because my husband's from Marion, IL (approx 18 miles) & thought he'd like it for his video collection.  The second disc is better.",1485129600,,353,4.645161290322581

8762075,5,B01G24WL0O,"I love this video and I love the book by Jim Kirkpatrick and Louise (Lou) Harrison (George's older sister). This is such a treat! (I have the DVD and not the VHS),

In mid-September, 1963 Beatle George Harrison and his older brother Peter visited their sister Louise and her family who, at that time were living in Benton, Illinois. Louise had local radio stations play her brother's records; she introduced him to people living in the area, including John Malkovich's family!

George met a local band called the Four Vests and played guitar with them; one Vest told George that ""with the right backing son, you'll go far."" That was humorously ironic because less than 3 months later, the Beatles would give a special Royal Command Performance for the Queen and, on February 7, 1964 make world history by their meteoric arrival in America!

I loved watching the interviews of Benton residents; one Vest said that when he saw George's hair, it reminded him of Moe Howard of Three Stooges' fame. Local disc jockeys and neighbors described their meetings with George as did the surviving members of the Four Vests. Interestingly, the Vests had a left-handed bass player like another band George played with.

In 1994-95, plans to demolish Louise Harrison's former house on McCann Street were made as the town wanted to install a parking lot. (Reminds you of Joni Mitchell's song, ""Big Yellow Taxi."") Neighbors, disc jockeys and even Louise herself rallied to save ""Beatle House,"" as the place was called. I loved watching the news footage from that time period and the tireless efforts of people to preserve the home George Harrison visited.

Their efforts paid dividends. Thanks to Louise, Beatle House is now a Beatle museum replete with Beatle paraphrenalia and videos. This is such a treat to watch and is a fascinating part of Beatle history. I give this a hearty endorsement and a ""yeah, yeah, yeah!"" Be sure to read ""Before He Was Fab,"" the book Louise co-authored about her brother's trip to Benton. You will be very glad you did.",1301875200,,2035,4.8530259365994235
