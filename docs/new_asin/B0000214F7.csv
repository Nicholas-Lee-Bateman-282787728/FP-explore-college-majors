8191956,3,B0000214F7,"This video includes six songs from the Land Before Time V and VI.  What I did not know when I bought it, is that it also includes three songs from An American Tail.  My five year old daughter loves the dinosaur songs but when  The American Tail songs came on she said, ""Do I have to watch this  part?"" The tape is 31 minutes long and a little less than half the  tape is devoted to American Tail songs.  We wish the entire tape included  Land Before Time songs.",959385600,84,461,4.112359550561798
