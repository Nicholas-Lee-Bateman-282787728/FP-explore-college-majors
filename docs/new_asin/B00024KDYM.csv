8022191,5,B00024KDYM,"This 1998 edition of ED SULLIVAN'S ROCK-N-ROLL CLASSICS is two half-hour episodes of the syndicated best of Sullivan series. Jay Thomas narrates vintage film clip montages prior to each act.

All are done ""live."" Only ""She Loves You"" is edited.

In contrast to their tough guy reputations, the Animals perform one number in b&w checked polyester leisure suits. When introing the Hermits, Ed calls their front man Peter Herman Moon. We learn from narration that Gerry & the Pacemakers were originally the Mars Bars until the candy company threatened to sue for copyright infringement.

Unlike the rest of these videotape clips, ""Time is on My Side"" is dubbed from film. After the studio audience went wild during this first Rolling Stones appearance, Sullivan vowed to never have the band on his show again. Even though he was riled by all the ruckus, Ed was still gracious enough to wish them success in an upcoming Sacramento concert. Despite that heat-of-the-moment threat, the Stones appeared five more times on ""Sullivan.""

Performances are ""live"" with these lip synched exceptions: ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,"" ""We've Only Just Begun"" and ""Love Child.""

The first half features two show-stopping Jackson 5 turns and the last TV appearance of Diana Ross with the Supremes. In part two, Janis Joplin has a pair of songs. It's noted that although ""Raise Your Hand"" was a Janis concert favorite, she died before the vinyl version of it was released. The Pips are seen in this ""First Women"" segment in bright green Robin Hood outfits. One week after Dusty Springfield's soulful ""Preacher Man"" appeared on Sullivan's show, the single hit #1 nationwide. During a post-song meeting with Ed, he gets Dusty to reveal that her name is ""Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien.""
