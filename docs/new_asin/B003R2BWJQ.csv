8403051,5,B003R2BWJQ,"One day we were surfing through on demand and I kept seeing Mona the Vampire they must have like 30 shows on demand on verizon...anyhow...I click on it and ever since then my God-Daughters were hooked.  Nice change from ""growny"" shows like the BRATZ no offense but they are a bit grown.  Mona uses her imagination a lot and the kids really enjoy the theme song.  Actually...we all do.  It is so catchy that we all sing it and sing it on the ending credits as well! =)",1347408000,,467,4.2727272727272725
