1785517,1,B00006LPJY,"Think about it people, this is a movie about somebody who isn't good enough to play on the worst nba team... so what does he do? he dresses in DRAG in order to play on a woman's basketball team. seriously pathetic. this movie is shameful to anybody and whoever sees it should be punched and/or kicked square in the teeth.",1025913600,4,321,4.366666666666666
1785518,4,B00006LPJY,This film was one that I at first hesitated to see but was quite impressed when I did.  I think Miguel Nunez Jr.(not Orlando Jones) was very funny in this comedy film.  Vivica Fox was as lovely as always.  In order to see this kind of movie one must come with an open mind and understand it's something not to be taken too seriously.  I have to say I'm happy to see Miguel Nunez getting more work and recognition than usual.  He's truly a very talented actor and hopefully we'll see more of him.  I have to say that I'm a little disappointed that so far there's no soundtrack for the film.  It has great music in it.,1024876800,10,616,4.169491525423729

1785578,5,B00006LPJY,"Juwanna Mann is so flipping funny! I don't know why its ratings on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes are so low. It's laugh - out - loud funny, and Miguel as Juwanna is a flawless performance--you never doubt him as Juwanna for a second. It's a feel-good movie that gets funnier each time you watch it. I highly recommend!",1484265600,,313,4.413793103448276

1785723,3,B00006LPJY,"Juwanna Mann(released Jun/02)stars Miguel Nunez Jr.in this better than average comedy as a ""star"" basketball player,who gets a much needed life altering experience/lesson. It also stars Vivica Fox,Kevin Pollack,Kim Wayans and Tommy Davidson;the latter two from the highly successful show In Living Colour.
The plot involves Nunez who is a star basketball player by the name of Jamal Jeffries,whose ego is only surpassed by the huge meltdown he has during a game in which,among other things,he moons the crowd. He is immediately suspended from the league and without a paycheck his extravagant social life comes crashing down around him. Broke and living with his Aunt,he comes up with a scheme to play in the major womens basketball league. He dresses up(much too convincingly I must say!),cons his former manager into signing him to a contract and ends up playing in the major womens league as he wanted,as Juwanna Mann. He is as successful there as he was with his former male teammates but again his ego starts to get in the way as he becomes a one man/woman team. He eventually falls in love with one of the teammates but learns some much needed life lessons to boot. His cover finally is blown when he does what his manager warned him not to,as he slam dunks a ball and in the process smashes the back glass. At the same time he loses his wig and the con is revealed for all to see.
Sitting before a tribunal to gain access back into the men's major league,his former lady team mates all come to rally around and support him. The film ends as his girlfriend gives him the team winners ring and a kiss.
Well acted all around,the entire cast is a boost to Nunez Jr.,who plays a strikingly beautiful girl player in the film in order to keep playing the game he loves. There are alot of nice comedy moments and Tommy Davidson plays an over the top suitor to Nunez's' Juwanna Mann. The main message of course is the human element of being a good person and overcoming ego to pursue that road. But it is all wrapped up in good fun and that's what counts.
Technically the film is in its a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is clear and crisp. Extras include a music vid by Fat Joe,the trailer,commentaries,and a behind the scenes featurette.
All in all an above average comedy with a wonderful life lesson lesson in the mix and Miguel Nunez Jr.going the extra mile in his wildly convincing cross-dressing role as Juwanna Mann. It didn't seem to get alot of traction when first released but I think this under rated sleeper is definitely worth the look.",1316217600,,2544,4.630530973451328

After he becomes desperate, Jamal decides to join the women's basketball team in order to stay in the game. He disguises himself as a woman and calls himself 'Juwanna Mann' After spending time with them, he begins to fall in love with one of his teammates, Michelle Langford.

He'll need brains, creative ball-handling and the right shade of lipstick. Jamal's only chance to get his game back is to join up with the other league--the women's basketball league.

1785756,3,B00006LPJY,Juwanna Mann isn't a horrible movie just a by the numbers comedy. The film has the same jokes that most gender benders comedy's do which get tired after a while. Miguel A .Nunez does good carrying the movie by himself but Tommy Davidson and Kim Wayans steal every scene their in. Ginuwine does a great acting job in his first movie and Mrs. Fox is good as always. While the jokes in the gilm are the same overall the film is good and has a nice message. If Warener had a soundtrack to back the film then it would have been better and Warner could have had a sleeper hit on their hands.,1221955200,,585,4.185840707964601

I admit I only made it to the part where he signs with the women's team, but I am not a glutton for punishment so I had to stop there. First off, the plot is stupid enough, but I let that go. Then the acting starts to undo the movie. The dude is so over the top it just makes me cringe. Not even Kobe Bryant is that arrogant and not even Ron Artest is that stupid. So the whole set up to him getting kicked out/suspended from the league is just ridiculous. Then you have to watch the overactor with the bad script in drag. I don't even watch the WNBA, why would I want to watch this corny verion? This movie should be banned and all copies destroyed.

I don't know how anyone can really be upset about this movie, if you read the back of the box you know exactly what to expect.  Gender/Racial stereotypes are the driving force behind the humor and, as usual, these don't add a whole lot of value to the movie.  I thought the Rasheed Wallace cameo was surprising and funny, but the movie overall is fairly predictable.  Rent it if you want to switch your brain off for approximately 91 minutes, but don't expect it to win any retroactive awards.",1092700800,3,575,4.39622641509434

1785763,3,B00006LPJY,"Juwanna Mann is one of those movies where you wonder what ...the actors and director were thinking!  I could see why Nunez Jr. ran for this role seeing how he hasn't had many starring roles but Vivica Fox, Kevin Pollack and Jenifer Lewis shocked ...me.  I kept wondering why in the world they were so desperate they took part in this.  The film isn't that bad, actually it's very funny but that fun can't help borderline on the verge of being pathetic.  Proving a cheap film can still get laughs unless you take it too seriously. If you take this film seriously you're in trouble.  The film has potential with the plot about a male NBA star getting kicked out of the NBA.  He cooks up a master plot of going drag and playing women's pro ball in hopes the NBA will see what they are missing. From there we have the typical "" Tootsie "". Juwanna falls for Vivica A. Fox, a teammate.  Kevin Pollack plays the slimy agent who will do anything to make a buck. Singer Ginuwine has a small role as Romeo, Vivica's cheating boyfriend and Tommy Davidson plays Puff Smokey Smoke, the man whose heart is stolen by Juwanna who he nicknames ( one tall glass of water ). Surprisingly Tommy was the funniest character in the film.  You never knew what he would do next and I hoped there would be more scenes with him and Juwanna. The basketball scenes ran too long and could have included more comedy.  The film was very short but that was probably a blessing in this case.  All in all the actors are talented and pull off this bad script well.  But it's nothing that they should include on any resume list. In fact they should all forget they made this film and move on.
One last thing, Lil' Kim was in it.  Take that any way you like.",1080259200,3,1720,4.32398753894081

1785785,5,B00006LPJY,"Hoop fans had the choice of not one but two basketball pictures in 2002 - 'lil Bow Wow's truly flacid LIKE MIKE and Warner Bros.' vastly superior JUWANNA MANN.  Bounced from the NBA for his incessant bad behaviour, Jamal Jeffries (Miguel A. Nunez, Jr.), plucks his brows, shaves his legs, and takes to the court of the WBA as the sassy and flashy Juwanna Mann, (Vivica A. Fox).  Liberally sprinkled with moments of humour and insight, JUWANNA MANN is a ""slam-dunk"" to please hoop fans and students of the human condition alike.",1038268800,2,527,4.717391304347826
1785786,1,B00006LPJY,"This movie is incredibly gut-wrenhing. I hate all movies where the whole story revolves around men dressing up as women,so it's kind of obvious why I hate this movie. Do you wanna know why this movie is bad?The movie is about someone who dresses up as a woman to play basketball. Nuff' said.

1785787,3,B00006LPJY,"This is good for some laughs and has a heart-warming story in a rather low-key way. But it will disappoint some. Pared-down to a PG-13 rating for whatever purpose, it seems a movie more suited for R-status. Those hoping for nude scenes in obvious places will be disappointed, for example. And gender bending issues are treated neither with aiming for depth or with the zaniest humorous effects, though they work somewhat more in the latter sense. Still for undemanding viewers it isn't the worst way to spend an hour and a half.",1032652800,4,528,4.75
1785788,5,B00006LPJY,"I felt this movie was excellent in so far as it was simple and had a good point. Yes it was somewhat unbelievable but what movie isn't? And yes it was a similar storyline to Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire but so what? It pointed out a good moral story, that teamwork is better than individual glory and it has some very funny scenes and cool music. So I would recommend it if you are looking for
a simple funny movie. ...",1031356800,2,417,4.160493827160494
1785789,5,B00006LPJY,"Juwanna Mann was full of laughs from the start to finish! Miguel A. Nunez Jr.(Jamal Jefferies/Juwanna Mann) handeled the role of playing both a man and a woman exceptionally well. Singer/Actor Ginuwine(Romeo)played his role as Vivica Foxx's(Michelle)boyfriend with great ease. Ginuwine has the talent,looks,and body to fit his character Romeo. Being that he is still new to the movie world he seemed to work with and play his character well. I will definetly look forward to seeing R&Bs sensation Ginuwine in more movies. I was so excited to see Ginuwine on the big screen again. Tommy Davidson (Puff Smokey Smoke) also made this movie worth wathcing. He brought a lot of comedy to this film. Vivica Foxx seemed to get in touched with her characters feelings. She got around to being the character well. Lil' Kim played a small role, but she played her role as a golddigger very well. They couldn't have chose somebody better! I have to say that Jesse Vaughan did a great job and all the others who were involved in this film! I really enjoyed this film!",1028246400,5,1054,4.7967032967032965
1785790,4,B00006LPJY,"I didn't think that Juwanna Mann was going to be that good but I decided to check it out anyway. I was wrong again. It was a very very funny comendy about a basketball player who acted rude during one game and got suspended. After his girlfriend left him because he doesn't make any more money he decides to try and get famous again after losing everything he ever worked for. Jamel(as that's his name)hatches a plan after seeing a really good female basketball player in the streets by his mother's house. He tells his agent that he knows a really good female basketball player and dresses himself up as a women and goes to his agent. His agent actually believes that he is a women untill Jamel shows himself. Jamel's agent doesn't think that his plan is gonna work but when he fool's everyone on a WNBA team the plan is set. Everything is going perfect for Jamel untill he falls in love....with a team mate.
Juwanna Mann is a very entertaining comendy about being who you are and not somebody eles. The film was slow at the start was rapidly got better.
ENJOY!",1027555200,,1062,4.4512820512820515
1785791,4,B00006LPJY,"Between 4 and 5 stars, Juwanna Mann is one of the best comedies of the year, I believe. The ending could've been better though, but the whole film is definitely great! For women looking into athletics, this is somewhat an inspiration; for others, it's a thought for life; all together, though, the movie is definitely hilarious with jokes, and other funnies to get you laughing. The whole cast is wonderful and sets the scene throughout, especially Miguel Nunez, Jr. who brings out the best of a feminine side. (Greatly played!)",1026172800,4,528,4.877777777777778
