5102097,5,B007OY6ZE0,"Would have preferred this had the original wrap most DVDs have when purchased since was sold as new, but was in perfect condition. Shipping was extremely quick which was much appreciated!",1372204800,2,187,5.064516129032258
5102098,4,B007OY6ZE0,I like the dvd pack of both the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds. The picture quality and sound was good. Only wish it was filmed in HD so you could feel the roar of jets when played on a home theatre system.,1366588800,,204,4.0
5102099,2,B007OY6ZE0,"Its ok, but you would think being released in 2012 it would have newer footage of the blue angels and an hour and forty five minutes on 4 dvds are you serious. It could have all been put on one disk. Should have gotten "" Blue Angels : a year in the life "".The seller was on time tho, yea.",1350259200,,288,3.816666666666667
5102100,3,B007OY6ZE0,"I got this for my Dad, because he loved the DVD Blue Angels: A Year in the Life. But, he was disappointed with this one. After watching it once, he said I could trade it back in on Amazon. In contrast, he watches A Year in the Life over and over again. The film quality on this one is not very good...like an older VHS of 80's film quality. Also, the music is very funky...very early 90's synth. LOL. He did say it had some interesting facts and footage, but it wasn't one he would watch again.",1349654400,8,494,4.103092783505154
5102101,1,B007OY6ZE0,"I am a big  Blue Angel fan, seen them in person at least 14 times and expected alot more from this dvd.  Picture quality was terrible  right out of older vhs  not dvd. Total disrespect to two great flying teams.... buy the blu ray of the Blue Angels it is money much better spent..........",1348185600,,289,4.296296296296297
5102102,1,B007OY6ZE0,"After seeing the Blue Angels a couple of months ago, I was looking for a DVD showing them. I preordered this so that I would have the most recent. Unfortunately, all of the footage is very old, the background music is a bad variation of ""Danger Zone."" Being old, the picture quality is poor. This did not keep my attention nor the attention of my preschooler. I have only watched one of the DVDs out of the pack because of this.",1344556800,2,428,4.296296296296297
5102103,5,B007OY6ZE0,"They don't tell you that this comes in a Digipak
I don't know why company's do this just makes it rough for the consumer.
Took all 4 out and looked them over for scratches and damage,all 4 look ok and all played.
I didn't put them back in their slots either,but put them in protective sleeves.
Outer case sleeve has a protective seal,you have to take the digipak out from the top after cutting the seal.
I hate Digipaks with cardboard on cardboard sleeves.
I'm including a pix of the Digipak.
Here is the run down on all 4 discs after playing them,there are 4 part's and the year shown at end,is 2008.
Also has cool menu-music.
Narration is extremely LOUD on all 4 discs unfortunately!
Part 1:Thunderbirds/Air Force,shown 1 fiery crash during an airshow.
Part 2:Thunderbirds/50 Years,better footage on this but loaded with info-teletype going across the lower part of your tv screen,music jazz score played,also better JET Sound.
Check out the X-35 hovering aircraft,a sight to behold changes like a transformer toy.
I like this disc for sound.
Part 3:Blue Angels/Navy,great sound and awesome interesting footage.
Check out the Fat Albert/combination prop+jets aircraft,really cool.
Part 4:Blue Angels/60 Years,excellent sea carrier footage and i like this disc.
So to sum it up,i like the Blue Angels better because they did more airshow tricks than the Thunderbirds.
If you like airshows and jets in general,then you'll like this.
I would recommend this especially if your in the Air Force or Navy.",1342137600,10,1500,4.9800796812749

5102115,2,B007OY6ZE0,I got these videos for my 4 yr old son who loves blue angels and thunderbirds... I thought 4 discs for 14 bucks why not well when we got them and I put them in for him to watch I know why the footage is literally from the 70s-90s nothing current on any of the DVDs very disappointed even my son asked why this looks so old when the DVDs are new.,1412467200,,345,3.8055555555555554

5102122,1,B007OY6ZE0,"This is a set of four DVDs. While the first disc had some decent footage the remainder of the discs were filled with old videos seemingly to provide the history of the Blue Angels and the Thunderbirds. The description provided is dishonest since it does not indicate that the majority of the time on the disks contains the second-rate older video feeds. Furthermore, the production is obscured by simple captions that travel around the screen and you cannot hear the sound of the jets (or older airplanes) over the annoying background music. I threw all four discs in my recycler to make sure nobody else would have the same disappointing experience I had.",1389312000,6,656,4.814159292035399
5102123,5,B007OY6ZE0,A lot of awesome maneuvers by the expert pilots.  It just go to show how good these professionals experienced pilots are.  This video is good to watch by everyone in a household.,1381449600,2,178,4.53125
