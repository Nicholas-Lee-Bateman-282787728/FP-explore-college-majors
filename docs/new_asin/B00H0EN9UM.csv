6126322,2,B00H0EN9UM,"***MAY CONTAIN PLOT SPOILERS***

Nick Di Santo (Luke Kleintank) what's in a name, has a special ability in that he can see how people are going to die. He has a small circle of friends and his mom is in a mental institution and only now is he seeing their deaths after 23 years. Nick inherits a house from his mom, an abandoned home which has things in the walls. He explores with his pregnant wife Eve (Alex McKenna) and meet Lilith (Lacey Anzelc) and Samael (Ethan S. Smith) and Seth (Tobin Bell) with an ax. Gosh. Where is this headed?

At this point it was pretty easy to guess who is Nick's father...his reason for visiting the house. Believe it or not I liked the film better with Frankenstein in it.

I grew bored watching the film. The building of the story and character was haphazard and ineffective. The actors weren't really that great except for Tobin Bell.

Mediocre rental.

6126323,1,B00H0EN9UM,"""Dark House"" needed a tighter edit on the screenplay and better direction. The film came off as ham-fisted, which is sad because the actors aren't bad and the premise is better than normal. If the film had been toned down, and more attention had been given to creating a darker atmosphere, the film could have been a refreshing break from the typical, murder-in-the-woods or found-footage dreck. Tobin Bell was wasted here, with terrible dialogue and a terrible hair-weave. Why the director decided to shoot the film in such glaring daylight is a mystery that killed any the actual film was trying to create. Victor Salva isn't a great director, but he can create an adequately on par film at times. This is not one of those. This is a sloppy film that smacks of someone phoning it in and collecting a paycheck. I'm not saying Salva doesn't have his heart in directing, but if he does, and this is the best he can do these days, maybe he should re-evaluate his next move.",1394755200,3,971,4.618497109826589
6126333,4,B00H0EN9UM,"A young man named Nick (well played by Luke Kleintank of MAX) has an interesting gift. If he touches certain people, he will be able to see how they die. This ability, however, ultimately plays no significant part in altering the final revelation in the unfolding story that is DARK HOUSE. In fact, it is the House that is the real star of this movie and appears to have (or contain) a life of its own. No matter what natural disasters affect the immediate area (the movie was filmed in Mississippi), the House survives and basically remains whole even though it is removed to a new locale a good distance from its original base. On his 23rd birthday (the number 23 is significant in this movie), Nick is summoned by his mother for a visit to an asylum where she has been institutionalized. Nick learns that his supposedly dead father may still be alive and Nick possesses the ownership deed to the Dark House. After Nick leaves his mother, she indulges in a strange conversation with a voice coming from an air or heating vent near the bottom of a wall in her room. Suddenly she is incinerated by flames emanating from the vent, and others in the asylum also perish in the fire.  Meanwhile Nick and a couple of his friends and pregnant girlfriend/wife(?) set out to find the ""Dark House"". With the help of a pair of civic surveyors, they miraculously find it. However, the great Tobin Bell (SAW) in all his spookiness suddenly emerges from DH and tells them to leave or else. Nick is stubborn and does not want to leave. Just then, a group of axe bearing shaggy looking individuals appears and comes after Nick and his associates.  To say anymore would be a spoiler.  Who are the creatures chasing Nick and why? Why does Tobin Bell want Nick gone? Why are all attempts to get away from the DH a failure since no matter which route is taken it always leads back to the House (shades of THE LEGACY with Katherine Ross)? Who are the real baddies? In the words of Julie Chen of ""Big Brother"" fame: ""Expect the unexpected.""  As usual, as is the case with so many horror movies, nothing is what it appears to be - And, in a final ""double"" ending, one is tempted to think of ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Omen"".  DARK HOUSE does not disappoint. Except for the DVD,  just don't go there.",1437436800,,2277,4.474698795180723

6126336,4,B00H0EN9UM,"Even with the film synopsis, I wasn't certain what to expect. The story was much more entertaining than the blurb described.  When his institutionalized mother dies in a fire, Nick Di Santo is left the deed to an old house which he recognizes as the one he's been sketching all his life and thought was only created in his mind. Nick also has the ability to tell how someone will die merely by touching them. This is barely utilized in the story but consideringhow things go, it relly isn't needed and seems to  have been added simply to give us a portent of the supernatural.

With his pregnant wife/girlfriend and best friend, he goes in search of his property. It's obvious to the viewer but not to Nick that his mother as well as her lawyer are conspiring with someone to get Nick to the house. He discovers both house and the town it was in were destroyed in a flood but a myth says the house merely floated downstream and still exists. Pushing it a little further, Nick encounters some state surveyors who just happen to know of the myth and within a few minutes help him find the house.  That was definitely a little fortuitous ...but in a movie Time is sometimes of the Essence, so we'll ignore that.

Up until discovering the house, there's merely a sense of ill-being. Once Nick finds the property, still in fairly good shape because it was stopped in its course by a hanging tree, the terror really begins. There's a squatter...long-haired, long-coated...who seems to know Nick and tells him in no uncertain terms to get lost. Other long-haired, long-coated figures shamble ape-like through the wood, wielding axes but Nick doesn't seem to be their target...

Interesting to see Tobin Bell unmasked in this one though it's a big question throughout as to who are the Good Guys and who the Bad. In fact, there's a twist here because looks can definitely be deceiving in this case. There's no Before to this story giving Nick's origins or why he has the power to foresee people's deaths or why his mother's in the asylum,  and one does wonder about that. A little more explanation would've been helpful though it definitely isn't necessary to sustain the note of incipient evil and terror throughout. It would've made things clearer but  viewing this superficially, the mindless terror involved reflects the way things sometimes happen...with no real explanation to those they happen to.

No one comes out and says who Nick's father is or why he's imprisoned in the house; consider his name and that may help a bit. One could probably sit around all night discussing what IS said and what it meant and never really come up with the conclusion the scriptwriter meant...if he had a meaning...but it would make for some interesting debates, I imagine. The main theme here seems to be scaring the viewer and it definitely does that.  You'll find this is one NOT to watch late at night, or if you do, not to think about afterward.

If analyzed, this movie would be considered a dud. Don't look for hidden, deep meanings, just watch it, take it at surface value, and be scared.",1427760000,,3080,4.6642066420664205
6126337,3,B00H0EN9UM,"This movie is OK for a Friday night light horror.  Mostly it is formula stuff but some parts get right under your skin, which is the whole point ...right?

The dragging axes was a nice touch. The movie is closer to a 4 than a 3 but you can't give half stars here and this one just doesn't make it to 4.",1426291200,,501,3.892156862745098

We could have an honest argument about whether it's a 2 or a 3, but it's not even a 4 and NO WAY a 5.

6126362,5,B00H0EN9UM,"I didn't expect anything near what I got. This film doesn't shy away from injecting fantasy and eschewing reality, so if you need things situated firmly in the laws of physics (the known ones anyway), then this probably won't be for you. If you have no trouble with suspending disbelief, then carry on. I am a sucker for demonic themed flicks, especially apocalyptic ones, and I so did not see that coming. The actors were competent and pulled off their respective roles, in appearing believable in a fantastical situation. I loved ""Seth"" and his hunchbacks. The latter gave me some good laughs. Overall, I am very pleased with the creativity shown here and wish I could see more like that. The story was intriguing and fun trying to decipher the clues, which were eventually all explained. I liked the 'next generation' ending and I would not mind revisiting the Dark House again, if a sequel was planned.",1396915200,2,906,4.777070063694268
6126373,4,B00H0EN9UM,"Dont mistake the title of this movie with the 2009 Fangoria-produced film of the same name.  I have not seen that one, but I would wager the plot lines are drastically different.  I wasn't sure what to expect going into this one because I had not heard any buzz about it, especially since Tobin Bell was involved.  But Im happy to report its a heck of a film with a unique story, good acting, and some great special effects.

Curiously, Ive read a few negative reviews about this film where the reviewer stated he/she didn't understand the film.  Im stunned to hear this, as I thought the plot line was easy to follow.  Not to mention, it is clever and intelligent, a nice change of pace from the traditional house-in-the-woods concept.

DARK HOUSE looks good and has a pretty decent production budget.  The production team does a nice job of fleshing out details in this film, especially when it comes to the house itself.  I like the location chosen, and the architecture of the structure is certainly menacing in its own right.

I enjoyed the acting in the film as well.  Tobin Bell never disappoints, and the rest of the cast does a good job overall.  I particularly like Luke Kleintank in the lead as Nick.  He brings a realistic depth to his role, and his chemistry with Alex McKenna (who portrays his girlfriend Eve) is very believable.

My sole complaint about the movie is that the ending seems a bit forced.  **SPOILER ALERT**  When Eve and Ryan find Nick in the house at the end, we are never shown nor told what happened when Nick went into the basement.  Theres a lot of assumption that is made (or at least there was on my part), so I feel the ending could have been fleshed out more.

Still, DARK HOUSE has a nice punch as a horror flick, and I do recommend it.  The film is available now, so give it a look.",1396915200,5,1823,4.42042042042042
6126374,4,B00H0EN9UM,"I thought this film was absolutely worth buying. It was cool, graphics were not SYFY cheap graphics done with cameras... it was scary, and a bit freaky but the end told you the story. I cannot imagine any horror fan not liking this its from the guy who gave us Jeepers Creepers and the first SAW. It was well acted and just had a creepy feel to it. I liked it as much as I did Conjuring. Though the subject matter was completely different. I do not believe you will find a better film. Most are using hand held cams I wouldn't sit through one of those... others are using all teen cast who can't act to save their lives... and if the actor can't act how do they expect anyone to be literally pulled into the film as if they were part of it... that's why so many films fail and whined up on that SYFY channel replaying movies over and frigging over until you lose your mind and don't even know what day it is. Buy this film or I will come over to your house and kick the crap out of your cat... ok then, your neighbors cat. And your neighbor. LOL!!!",1396915200,4,1048,4.117073170731707

Review - 4/5
I didn't expect much going into this until I seen Victor Salva (director of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers/dp/B000IZAHB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jeepers-Creepers-2/dp/B002Q32OQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jeepers Creepers 2</a>) was at the helm. Jeepers Creepers is at the top of my all time favorite horror films. Also, nice to know the 3rd is in the making. I wish he would hurry up with that one :(. This film reminds me a little of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wrong-Turn/dp/B001HM22W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wrong Turn</a>.

Tobin Bell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B000XSEPYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>), creepy house, and a partly original story. It isn't cheaply made with a handheld either. I would say the budget was somewhere in the millions. Though the acting isn't the greatest ever, it made me a little uneasy at times and wonder what would happen next. The ending wasn't as great. I felt like it was a little ridiculous. The lead actor Luke Kleintank did ok as the person who is able to see someones death if he touches their skin. It consists of him and others searching for answers about his father and a house he has been drawing for years. Well he finds the house and it's pretty action packed from then on. His father is actually someone ridiculous. Wont say more because it would ruin the film. All around good movie with great action. It's not really scary in the jump out of your seat kind of way. It's more of a backwoods Wrong Turn kind of terror.",1396569600,12,2029,5.831649831649831

Typically, from my experience, I get screwed by renting movies like that.  I was absolutely, positively WRONG with this film.  With the abundance of good reviews from people I trust as having similar taste to mine within the horror genre (my favorite genre), I rented this movie last night.  It was really good - I so enjoyed the entire film...the story, the actors, the scenery, the gore, the blood, the jump out of my seat & screams.

I have changed my previous review which I listed as a warning when this movie was first released - this movie was actually good, really good. My only question came at the ending, which was abrupt and left me with some unanswered questions on what actually happened.  What do you think happeaned at the end?

8629016,4,B00H0EN9UM,"I enjoyed the movie, DARK HOUSE. I thought the story was original and unpredictable. The actors were good, especially the young man (Luke Kleintank) who played ""Nick"".  Most of the main characters were well developed which made me, personally, care about their outcomes, especially the female who played 'Eve' and the aforementioned 'Nick', who played a couple in the film. I found myself rooting for ""Nick"" and ""Evie"" to make it to the bitter end because both of their characters were so likable, despite Nick having a rather strange ""gift"" of being able to just touch someone and know if that person will die a horrible death. (Don't worry-you learn this in the first 15 minutes of the movie!)
Anyway, Nick has had lots of challenges to grow up with, one being his mother who is residing in the State Mental Hospital and has been since he was 8 or 9. He's always wanted to know more about his father but his mother claimed not to remember him. In the first scene, Nick is going to visit his mother after several years and it's also his 23rd birthday. While he is visiting with her, she starts talking about his father and he accuses her of either lying now or when he was a child, as she always said she didn't remember him. She then tells Nick that she had ""promised the things hidden in the wall that she would tell him all about his dad, today"" to which he replies, ""Well, I just came by to see if you're still crazy and that kind of answers my  question"" or something to that effect. Nick then proceeds to go celebrate his birthday and the rest of the story kicks in from there.
