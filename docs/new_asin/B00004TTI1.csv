7923105,5,B00004TTI1,My Virtual Fireplace was the life of the party.  It arrived on time and just in time for Christmas and everyone was amazed.  It was relaxing for when I wanted to sit back and relax with a good book and I believe that it warmed my heart most of all.,1169078400,,248,3.94
7923106,1,B00004TTI1,I placed the video in the player and it worked for about 15 mintues and then nothing. I took it out and found that it was a broken tape..,1141257600,,137,3.7586206896551726
7923107,5,B00004TTI1,"This tape is the BEST GIFT. I gave this tape to my cryosurgeon and he loved it. I love this movie so much, I even made copy of it and sold it on E-Bay for 25.00$.

Buy this if you want to make a lot of money on E-bay.

Buy this if you have a big screen T.V. and feel like watching burning wood in a fireplace

Ps: it sounds like your room is on fire if you have Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound **********very Entertaining*********.....Great Quality Product",1101859200,2,457,4.170454545454546
7923108,3,B00004TTI1,"Besides the sound track sounding like out take SFX from ""Backdraft"" the video quality is pretty good. After I got this tape, I found a cheaper one (to give as a gift) that is just as good by doing a Google search on ""Video Fireplace.""",1100649600,,234,4.222222222222222
7923109,5,B00004TTI1,"One thing I miss about living in a house is having a fireplace, but now I have the next best thing---video fireplace! People I've showed it to thought it was a strange idea, until they start to watch the video...it's oddly comforting and almost hypnotic.
One note: turn down the sound on your TV, or you'll think your house is burning down.",1008460800,8,340,4.5
7923110,4,B00004TTI1,"Since we already own the one-hour Video Aquarium, we thought it would be nice to have the Fireplace for our winter parties in our basement.  We didn't like having to rewind Aquarium during our parties, so when we saw a three-hour Fireplace, we bought it.  We decided to buy the ""generic"" Fireplace instead of the ""Christmas Yule Log"" with Christmas music, because we can play our favorite Christmas CD's along with the crackling fire on the tape.  Our only criticism is that the crackling seems a little overly enhanced.  It sounds like a forest fire instead of a lazy fire.",972691200,35,574,4.71
