8382376,5,B002VR9QZU,"I found this  a very poignant story of a  family caught up in a historical situation, over a long period of time, which was beyond their control despite their contribution to the arts and particularly music. A very good genealogical story of the family's history  and survival in the face of continual .and yet at times subtle persecution.",1477440000,,339,4.810344827586207

8382378,3,B002VR9QZU,"Mendelssohn is my favorite composer, so I thoroughly enjoyed the story as well as the musical score.  However, the mix of narrative and music was poorly done; there were times when music should have faded into the background but didn't, making it difficult to follow the story at times.",1375401600,3,286,4.836734693877551
8382379,3,B002VR9QZU,"I was very excited about receiving this DVD on Felix Mendelssohn and the Nazis.  I viewed two other DVD's that I ordered from Amazon on Beethoven and Mozart from the same publishers.  Both had written subtitle options.  I was so incredibly disappointed to discover accessible options were not available on the Mendelssohn DVD.  I will try to find out how I can acquire a transcript. Why this is not available in caption for the hearing impaired and subtitles for other at least a couple of other common languages is a mystery. I can hear the music and hear some of the verbal when the voice and face is visible.  Otherwise, a narrator voice in the background  makes it impossible to decipher the words.  I gave the DVD 3 stars for this reason.",1364256000,7,743,4.583333333333333
8382380,5,B002VR9QZU,"For anyone interested in Mendelssohn and the fate that his legacy and family suffered in Nazi Germany this is highly recommended. Hayman deftly interweaves the issues of composer's dual identity as a Jew and Christian as reflected in his music with her own family's struggle with identity and the diabolical methods that the Nazis employed to weed out non-Aryans and to erase Mendelssohn's music from Germany's cultural heritage. The film isn't always easy to watch and I found myself tearing up a couple of times, but, in the end, it is also a tale of good triumphing over evil. After all, Mendelssohn's music survives and so does his family.

By the way, I believe that Hayman herself descended from Felix's sister Fanny who we now know was a gifted musician and composer, although, surprisingly, this is never mentioned in the film. I have read a lot about the Mendelssohn family in the past year and think this remarkable family deserves its own movie!",1284076800,19,956,4.865030674846626

I returned it and requested a replacement (in writing) but received a refund instead.",1270166400,,158,5.32
8382382,5,B002VR9QZU,"This is much more than your normal documentary. It is about the composer, his descendants, music, and religion. The nazi period documented is the culmination of bigotry, and its musical defeat. The no so extraordinary history of an extraordinary composer, his family background and the many human questions raised in the story are, to me, the center part of this documentary, more than the actual awful and stupid ideas of the nazi period. It is very poignant how Sheila Hayman poses the question of Jewishness in her family's blood.  Moses Mendelssohn, the grandfather of the composer, started to address the question of Jews separated from Christians, and Felix Mendelssohn answered it with his music. I leave it to each one who watches this DVD to question and answer it for himself. Highly recommended.",1266969600,14,806,5.06015037593985
