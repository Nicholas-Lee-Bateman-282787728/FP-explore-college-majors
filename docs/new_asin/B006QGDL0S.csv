This is Madhubala's last film (I believe) and there are some really emotional scenes which leads me to believe she was getting even better and deeper as an actress.  One can only imagine what kinds of roles she might have been able to start in later in life -- so very tragic that she died so young. Well, this is of many very good films she gave the world and it's truly a gift. Depending on your appreciation of classic Indian films, music and dance numbers, and the silliness of some aspects of the more commercially minded Bollywood directors of that era, I think Sharabi stands out due to its hard-hitting, universal social theme of alcoholism. Nevermind the somewhat stilted acting here and there by Dev Anand -- I think this is just the light-hearted style of the day, which works just fine for me -- the lovely songs by Mohammad Rafi (about drinking and loneliness) and the beautifully faithful Madhubala really make this sad story work. Despite a somewhat abrupt, shocking ending, it was a gratifying movie. Will watch it again.",1510531200,,1170,4.7073170731707314
