3411964,3,B001874QM2,Didn't show as much as I hoped! Not many villages shown & would have liked to have seen more countryside!,1371772800,,105,4.3
3411965,3,B001874QM2,"We expected something more comprehensive and fast paced.  After we visit there we will know if it captures the ""Real Cornwall"".",1365292800,,127,5.0476190476190474
3411966,1,B001874QM2,"Did not work in 3 different dvd players.  It did work in one and on a computer.  We had to totally strip the video and reformat it to get it to work.  I bought this for my grandmother who is from Cornwall and I had to spend 2 weeks figuring out why it didn't work and then stripping it to get it in the correct format.

That said, if you can do all of that or you get lucky and it plays on your DVD player, it is a good video.",1309392000,,426,3.6483516483516483
3411967,4,B001874QM2,"A nice glimpse of Cornwall.  They dwelt a bit long on the Pencarrow House at Washaway and the Tate St Ives, but it still has a nice variety and good photography.",1277424000,7,161,4.193548387096774
3411968,1,B001874QM2,This DVD does not play - I suspect that it was produced for UK use only. I returned it and asked for a new copy that would play - was sent the same thing.  It should not be offered as playable in America,1244505600,2,203,3.7209302325581395
3411969,3,B001874QM2,More realistic than views from the television . I liked how it showed history of area.,1455926400,,86,4.4375
3411970,5,B001874QM2,"This was made @ 1995 and is quite good. The history is wonderful and information about one of the port towns that makes ship replicas is incredible. I don't know if they are still building replicas, but I would LOVE to visit!",1455580800,,225,4.380952380952381
3411971,1,B001874QM2,This is s very old production probably from the 70s. It almost seemed home made. We only watched a small portion of it.,1455580800,,119,4.217391304347826
3411972,3,B001874QM2,brings back some memories,1454976000,,25,5.5
3411973,3,B001874QM2,"Very interesting but outdated,  The scenery was beautiful.",1447804800,,58,6.25
3411974,4,B001874QM2,Thoroughly enjoyed it.,1446076800,,22,6.666666666666667
3411975,5,B001874QM2,i enjoyed this presentation.,1444348800,,28,6.25
3411976,2,B001874QM2,Love Cornwall but the film is kind of 'old' and slow.,1441152000,,53,3.909090909090909
3411977,4,B001874QM2,Very informative. Beautiful scenery. Watch this before you watch Poldark series.,1439683200,,80,6.363636363636363
3411978,4,B001874QM2,Lots of interesting things in Cornwall.,1436745600,,39,5.666666666666667
3411979,3,B001874QM2,Cornwall is beautiful and I was hoping for a better tour of the area. I would have liked to have seen more and better photography.,1435968000,,130,4.24
3411980,1,B001874QM2,Way too slow to start.,1433721600,,22,3.6
3411981,4,B001874QM2,The countryside is beautiful.,1432080000,,29,6.5
3411982,2,B001874QM2,"What a disappointment. The couple of towns that were covered in this documentary were covered well, but I would much rather have seen a broader scope that included more towns, personalities, and variety in a superficial manner than simply leaving out most of what makes Cornwall Cornwall. An hour isn't long to summarize such a rich area, but it should have been named for the couple of towns it covered.",1430956800,,404,4.785714285714286
3411983,3,B001874QM2,"Ok, but not very detailed. It should've been longer to show more of the beautiful coastal villages. Cornwall is a place all it's own!",1425081600,,133,4.583333333333333
3411984,1,B001874QM2,Didn't  hold my interest,1425081600,,24,5.0
3411985,4,B001874QM2,"Fun, watch with Doc Martin series!",1420243200,,34,4.833333333333333
3411986,4,B001874QM2,informative and ineresting,1420070400,,26,8.0
3411987,4,B001874QM2,"I loved seeing it and will watch again. Have been watching a show called Doc Martin and he is in a town called FortWhenn. I guess it is not a real name for the place or maybe it is. Am so interested in the UK at this point in my life. I love the people and just different ways than America. Love my country but would like to learn about others. Would love to visit but in a wheelchair and would need some help. Anyway, I love Cornwall. Thanks Raven Steele.",1419897600,,456,4.021978021978022
3411988,4,B001874QM2,Informative and entertaining program about the history and natural features of Cornwall.,1417824000,,88,6.416666666666667
3411989,3,B001874QM2,"The subject matter was good, but the video quality was terrible.",1415404800,,64,4.909090909090909
3411990,1,B001874QM2,incredibly boring,1414886400,,17,8.0
3411991,3,B001874QM2,dated production and the resolution is low,1413244800,,42,5.142857142857143
3411992,3,B001874QM2,"Sort of dated, I expected more of a  scenic tour but was disapointed",1412121600,,68,4.230769230769231
3411993,2,B001874QM2,Interesting but does not provide geographical context. I know it is in the UK and it would have been nice if it explained exactly where Cornwall is via a map or some other graphic,1410912000,,179,4.294117647058823
3411994,3,B001874QM2,It's an older film showing Cornwall. I felt the focused too much on individuals instead of showing more of the area.,1409961600,,116,4.571428571428571
3411995,3,B001874QM2,"While there are many beautiful shots of Cornwall in this DVD, much of the narration is like a school filmstrip.  I was kind of bored watching this, and I'm an Anglophile and a teacher (I love school filmstrips!)  It's okay, but not very exciting.  I just couldn't get excited about an aristocratic silver dog collar or the amount of clay that can be loaded onto a ship in six hours.",1400025600,,382,4.428571428571429
3411996,2,B001874QM2,"Bored me silly. In my opinion, watching paint dry would have been more entertaining.  If you're an Anglophile you'll prpobably like it.  Pour a cup, sit back...and snooze.",1399507200,,171,5.071428571428571
3411997,2,B001874QM2,Some interesting history but not much for travel planning.  Rather outdated and I found the commentator's voice lacking in appeal.,1399334400,,130,5.5
3411998,3,B001874QM2,I took a trip years ago to Cornwall to see where my Great grandparents lived. They moved to the copper mines of the upper peninsula of Michigan in the 1870's.  I wanted to see more of Cornwall.  This travelogue was good.  I learned a lot. Watch it.,1394150400,,248,4.23404255319149
3411999,4,B001874QM2,This film is quit good and makes me want to visit this area of England. Book your trip now. Enjoy!,1394150400,,98,3.95
3412000,2,B001874QM2,The beginning of the movie was good with information about the area and lovely pictures.  But it got tedious about half way through,1391040000,,131,4.695652173913044
3412001,2,B001874QM2,"After loving Doc Martin (especially Louisa) I was really looking  forward to a look at Cornwall. Unfortunately my Texas ears had a real hard time with the dialects. I mean a really hard time! If you can understand them this looks like an interesting show, but since I cannot I will probably watch only the first episode.",1390953600,,320,4.614035087719298
3412002,2,B001874QM2,"Spent way too much time on the ""niceties"" like touring some mansion and no time on Cornwall's fascinating history and some of the attractions attached thereto; very little time spent on the stunning beauty of the coast.",1390953600,7,219,4.945945945945946
3412003,1,B001874QM2,"Very dated and dry.  Poor cinematography. Ignores nearly every major tourist site of Cornwall to focus on one ""Great House"" (which isn't that great) and a mildly interesting port village.  Not one mention of Arthurian legend sites, Truro, Port Isaac, etc.. Don't waste your time.",1390953600,8,279,5.177777777777778
3412004,5,B001874QM2,"Quite a lovely documentary on one of the most beautiful areas of the U.K., Cornwall. Easy paced and very much makes me want to plan a trip there someday.",1390435200,3,153,4.310344827586207
3412005,5,B001874QM2,"I love England, espcially the coastal towns, beautiful scenery, I am from Ipswich suffolk, have lived in the USA for 43 years, I miss the Seaside!  It was a very enjoyable virtual visit.",1390262400,7,186,4.636363636363637
3412006,2,B001874QM2,I found this to be dated and very uninspiring.  Have always wanted to visit Cornwall but not so sure after viewing this.,1389052800,5,120,4.454545454545454
3412007,3,B001874QM2,"My constant companion, my travel coffee mug, now sports a ""I love Cornwall"" sticker! I visited Cornwall last year and loved every minute of my 10 days there. A beautiful part of the world with friendly people and amazing hiking!
The film was good but neglected the outdoors, the pubs, and the bike trails.",1388880000,11,305,4.666666666666667
3412008,5,B001874QM2,Such beautiful country and information on where to go and areas to avoid because of heavy tourism.  But I`m not sure I would want to miss any place.,1379548800,2,148,4.285714285714286
8268618,4,B001874QM2,"Watching episodes of Doc Martin , I had an interest to watch The Real Cornwall .  It's very picturesque and full of information on the history of Cornwall . I totally enjoyed it .",1485388800,,179,4.264705882352941
8268619,3,B001874QM2,Although it was informative it was somewhat disjointed.  They never used a map to give you any idea where they were in Cornwall.,1485388800,,128,4.565217391304348
8268620,4,B001874QM2,"I luv anything made like this from England, I'v watched this 4 times",1483574400,,68,4.3076923076923075
8268621,3,B001874QM2,Ok,1475366400,,2,2.0
8268622,3,B001874QM2,somewhat redundant and therefore boring.  Nice scenery and not much more.,1471392000,,73,5.636363636363637
8268623,5,B001874QM2,The photography is wonderful.  Even though dated at this time (2016) the information has good historic information and is narrated very well.,1461801600,,141,5.409090909090909
8268624,4,B001874QM2,informative but a little boring at times,1461024000,,40,4.857142857142857
8268625,5,B001874QM2,Gives many insights as to the interesting history of Cornwall.,1458518400,,62,5.3
