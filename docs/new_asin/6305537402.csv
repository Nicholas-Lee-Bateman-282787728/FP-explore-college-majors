1042973,3,6305537402,"Visiually stunning!! I can see the influence these short films must have had on the band Tool's music videos. Dark ,mysterios,strangely erotic,humorous. It also has two music videos for the band His name is Alive. Very cool. Some of the short films are a bit on the boring side. The street of crocodiles is the crown jewel of this collection of short films.  Tool fans would probably dig this video.",1021593600,,399,4.7
1042974,1,6305537402,"I was ready to be swept away by the Quay brothers and their
""unique""...""bizarre"" style. After the initial viewing I sat stunned at the thought of the money I had just spent for
nothing because nothing is what you get with this DVD. Highly
pretentious titles to these shorts are married with (to me)
clumsy stop action, incomprehensible and seemingly random
story lines (if any exist), music that is atonal, irritating,
and sadly lacking in any redeeming feature. Well, I could go on
but won't. I wanted to like this but was unable to appreciate any part of it. I am deeply suspicious of anything that pretends to artistic merit because it is incomprehensible, disjointed, different, and chaotic. If you like clever animation please buy the stunning ANIMUSIC DVD-simply wonderful!",1013644800,6,779,5.0
1042975,5,6305537402,"When I first saw the animation of the Brothers Quay, I was totally entranced. Their stop-motion puppet style is so bizzare and unique, it pulls you in.
First, they use ""antique dolls"" for their characters. everything has an old and used feel.
Second, is the use of ""common items"". This really brings it to another level. Nothing is more artistic than a ballet of wood screws, an old pocket watch, and some very creative uses for red meat (you just have to watch it). It can be disturbing at times, but with their sense of direction and cinematography you will almost always find something new with each viewing.
I can see some people who are into mainstream things absolutely hating their work. It is bizzare to say the least. But there is a unique charm that these brothers have created in their dark world.
On this DVD, to me the main features are ""Nocturna Artificiala"", their first feature (a ""bonus"" on the DVD), ""Street of Crocidiles"" (the one that I found the easiest to follow, yet one of the more bizzare), and ""The Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer"" (tribute to the Chech animator). Most of the other films are shorts under 5 minutes, but it is still a great DVD to own if you like the art of animation.",1011916800,17,1205,4.532110091743119
1042976,5,6305537402,"This collection of ten short films is both revolutionary and revolting.  The brothers are actual identical twins, born in Pennsylvania, now living  in seclusion in London, who have created a warped vision all their own.  Using jerky stop-motion animation and a variety of inanimate household  items, this celluloid world is full of darkness and nightmares. Ranging in  length from one minute to 21-minutes, it's best to watch this tape in  segments; otherwise, your brain will become numb trying desperately to make  some type of sense out of the twisted visuals playing out before you. If  you have ever seen the music videos for Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer""  or Marilyn Manson's  ""Tourniquet,"" you have already tasted the  influence of the brothers. Particularly recommended for anyone with a  phobia of porcelain baby dolls -- face your fears!!",968025600,28,844,5.17037037037037
1042977,5,6305537402,"I'm not exactly sure how to describe the Brothers Quay work other than  it's one of those things that transcends its genre and evokes real and  powerful emotions in the viewer. These short films, all of which are  masterpieces of stop-motion animation, are all very dreamlike and abstract,  but the fact that you may not understand what's going on all the time  doesn't really  matter. What's important here isn't the plot or meaning,  but the aesthetic and style, much like other (narrative and non-narrative)  forms of art. Really, if I had to chose one word to describe the work of  the Brothers Quay it would be ""beautiful"".
My only complaint  with this DVD is that the menus and indexing aren't quite set up right, so  when one short ends, you have to manually hit the ""menu"" button  on your remote to go back or it'll keep playing through to the next short.  Regardless, these shorts are definitely worth having on DVD because of the  superior picture quality and the convenience of being able to skip to the  individual shorts (not to mention the fact that the DVD includes a few  extras, like an interview with the Quays).",965779200,24,1130,4.659898477157361
1042978,5,6305537402,"The Brothers Quay have been producing surreal short stop-motion animated films and videos since 1979.  This dvd features 11 different shorts, often grotesque but always stunningly beautiful animation in each.  The two  shorts I am most familiar with, ""Are We Still Married"" (1992) and  ""Can't Go Wrong Without You"" (1993) were music videos produced  for 4AD Records for the band His Name Is Alive.  Both feature similar  character animation to several of the Tool videos of the mid-nineties, such  as ""Prison Sex"".  Yet I think the Brothers Quay have a more  subtle and complex style.  Another stylistic influence on BQ is Czech  animator Jan Svankmajer, who produced a macabre version of Alice in  Wonderland called ""Alice"" using fish skeletons and animal skulls  as a medium.  Indeed, the link is more than a coincidence -- one short,  titled ""the Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer"" (1984) pays hommage to  Jan.
Any fan of animation should check out these artists.  Even if you  are not a fan of 'experimental' or non-narrative film, you will find much  to enjoy and discuss about their work in this collection.",961372800,22,1105,4.967032967032967
1042979,5,6305537402,"It's nice to have so many Quay shorts crammed together onto one tape, though some of their early films (""Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer"" especially) tend to get a bit tedious unless you're really in the mood. I'm  sure label/contract nonsense precluded them from including some of their  music videos -- the Michael Penn and his Name is Alive sequences would have  rounded this out wonderfully. The high points here -- ""The Street of  Crocodiles"" and ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"" -- are so unlike  anything else ever done, yet somehow so familiar, that they defy  description. The are like a glimpse into the dreaming self, steeped in  chittering dangers, endlessly self-elongating shadows and an Eastern  European/Central Asian musical sadness so rich and deep, and so strangely  flavored, redolent with the mixed smells of ancient motor oil, saffron,  cinnamon, dried blood, sulphur and woodsmoke. A peek into something we all  are but have not yet given a name to. Haunting, mesmerizing, creepy as  hell, these films will stay with you for days. The dance of the screws in  ""The Street of Crocodiles"" is especially jarring -- so visually  logical when it's happening right before your eyes, yet nothing you'd ever  have thought of before.",957225600,8,1231,5.024752475247524
1042980,5,6305537402,"I was quite literally blown away on seeing ""Street of Crocodiles"" 10 years ago. An incredible mix of dark surreal animation, moments in time and stunning cinematography. They have influenced so many  styles of animation and film making since then and continue to create a  brilliant organic style that will allways stand apart. Genius!",937785600,4,335,5.185185185185185
1043070,3,6305537402,"I first saw the works of these two brothers in 1990. I thought there style of animation was so different then what I had seen before. Although these twin brother directors are American you could not see it in there work. It looked very eastern European, as if it had come out of some Soviet block TV series.
While the short films on this DVD make little sense or follow any story line, there are visually fascinating to look at. Some times the imagery is disturbing to look at. If dolls had nightmares this is what they might look like.
I can't say I liked their work, but I do feel it is ground breaking visually interesting and creative. This is not for those with a passing fancy in stop-motion animation.",1259193600,,708,4.412213740458015
1043071,4,6305537402,"Strictly for lovers of old-time silent westerns. Full of excitement. You can almost hear the matinee audience yelling and cheering. Chuck Drexell (Bob Custer) is the all-around cowboy hero in a big, handsome hat. He's after a bunch of cattle rustlers led by beefy, balding J. P. McGown, who also directed this spirited oater. No time is wasted getting down to business - we meet the rustlers first, then the pretty heroine Dolly (Peggy Montgomery), who tries to stop them from taking her father's cattle, not knowing that he's in on the deal. Then Chuck rides in and soon starts sparring with Dolly, who doesn't like his condescending attitude. She even takes a shot at him with a loaded revolver.

There's much chasing back and forth on horses, a fist fight that somehow finds its way on to a barn roof before it's over, a message written in code, stunt riding, an Eastern dandy who turns out to be in cahoots with Drexell, and a race to save Dolly, who is cornered in a bedroom by two of the rustlers who have more on their mind than swapping recipes. In the end, the rustlers are taken away by the posse, and Chuck and Dolly disappear behind his big hat for a smooch. All in under an hour. Gives new meaning to the phrase ""those thrilling days of yesteryear."" Currently available for online viewing at Internet Archive.",1259020800,,1322,4.601694915254237

1043073,5,6305537402,"If your experience of stop-animation ended with ""Davey and Goliath"" or Gumby, you're in for a shock. The Quays present a series of works in unique, symbolic style. The question is, just what do those symbols mean?

The short pieces are nearly monochrome - something that seems to detach the works from any one time period. Puppets and props are finely crafted, and create conflicting moods. That one character, with head made from an open book, is an example. The steel blades that it uses for hands whisper of every slasher movie you've seen. Then you realize that they're pen tips for drafting pens, an artist's creative tools. Babydolls with open heads spew their stuffing, remains of birds return to something like life, dark characters lurk stained and scuffed landscapes filled with bizarre beings and machines.

They're some of the most eloquent animations I've ever seen - lyrical poems or dark chants turned into images, but in a language that I can't quite make out. Don't look for a close understanding, since you'll see something different each time you look. But you'll want to look, again and again.

Every short film of theirs that I have had the pleasure to see has been fulfilling on multiple levels; from lighting to composition to the amazing detail and story that is conveyed without words.  They share a twisted and thoughtful beauty that cannot be aptly put into words.

1043077,5,6305537402,"Within reason and on occasion, when it harms no one, I like accessing the parts of the mind capable of being reached only when confronted with something too weird for easy dismissal. In our jaded age when even the most ""unplugged"" among us are bombarded with an inundating miasma of images, it takes something truly unique to make us halt and evince a genuine reflex of revulsion mingled with curious delight. The collected Brothers Quay films are such a force. I first discovered these singular filmmakers, brothers who departed from the American Midwest for the freer creative ranges of London, England, when I happened upon their work through an old VHS tape of the PBS series Alive From Off Center, which featured a short film by the duo entitled Street of Crocodiles. I wanted to see more from the wondrously demented minds of this pair, so I bought the collection I'm reviewing. Not only does it offer the deliciously creepy Street of Crocodiles, but nine other pieces. It's worth the investment and it's worth seeking out. This DVD can be hard to find offline, so my advice is grab it from Amazon while it's available!",1167955200,,1125,4.774358974358974

Some interesting visuals and moody music, but at times it's unpleasantly grotesque.  The sequences are seemingly pointless.  I don't think any of these reviewers who give it 5 stars can explain in plain English what the point of these films are or offer up any good reason why one should invest one's money and time on them.

The original surrealists usually shocked to make a point, but these films seem to shock just because they can. If you can joyfully watch ""An Andalusian Dog"" over and over, then you will find this disc gets viewed a lot, too. Otherwise, it's something you may come back to once a year, and after watching it again shake your head and mutter ""So close, so close.""

I had no problems whatever with the mechanics of the DVD. Everything worked just as it should. There are a couple of shorts that are poorly framed (the edges are cut off) and the sound is lousy in the interview, but in general it's well produced.",1140739200,5,861,4.584415584415584

They are interesting and I would recommend watching them one at a time (unless it's the really short ""Still Nacht"" series) and late at night.

For example if you've seen Institute Benjamenta or any Jan Svankmajer films you'll probably pick this up. If you haven't it's most likely not your cup of tea. I would like to take some of the reviewers to task though. Alot of you have automatically assumed that folks who enjoy Hollyood movies, Coca-Cola, TV, and American beer are total drooling idiots and would never enjoy something like this, which leads me to believe you are probably teenagers, or complete fools. I enjoy all of the above. I see no difference between watching Caddyshack and listening to AC/DC or watching Holy Mountain and listening to Napalm Death.

The use of scavenged materials and cracked dolls, surreal environs, and the bizarre camera work, in addition to the haunting music are unforgettably unique and original.  Before all those  pretentious art students started using doll heads, there were the Brothers Quay. Before the MTV knock-off videos, their were the original Brothers Quay. Repetition and distortion reoccur in disturbing scenarios that can not fully be explained, nor should they be. In their B/W shorts, it is as though microsopic, hybrid forms have been filmed under a magnifying lens, and we, the voyeurs, are drawn into their obsessive-compulsive world. The brothers pay hommage to Czech animator, Jan Svankmajer (check out his trippy version of ""Alice"" in Wonderland), but lack his crisp, clear, punch-in-the-face political satire in favor of blurry,dreamscapes of paranoia and non-verbal insanity. What is revealed is a slow, intense inspection of parts: hybrid machines and dolls with human and animal instincts; at once  familiar yet frighteningly unfamiliar. Their perception through the camera lens is mind-tweaking with exagerrated depth of field, asymmetrical compositions/montage,and movements in and out of focus. Their atmospheric, equivocal expressions make contemporary digital animation seem gimmicky and expressionless. *Word of warning to DVD buyers and distributors: The DVD distributor, Kino, has advertised Special Features, including a rare interview with the Brothers Quay and their first film.  The Special Features of this DVD, unfortunately, cannot be accessed on most DVD players or computers until the company resolves this problem and puts out a new version, which they are evidently looking into (they've received complaints already).

You can if you want but that would get boring. It's usually something you must loose yourself in in order to enjoy. i.e. pick a lonely day when you're feeling particularly despondent and sit in a dark room and watch. Not with your girlfriend because she'll get bored and hate you for being such a boring pseudo-intellectual. I can't the entire DVD at once because I fall asleep. There's no apparent coherent story line to any of them. Sometimes, if you try, you can make out a story or an underlying message, particularly in ""the COMB"". All the films are more like dreams.

The Quays are true masters of stop motion animation. Creating fluid motion sequences like I have never seen anyone else do. They use B/W highlighted with color to bring emphasis to certain areas. .
They explore the relation of the individual vs. the institutional powers, without falling into the cliches that plague most films dealing with this subject. The juxtaposition of cute doll people set into a dark world of rigid control creates a world that is very engaging, but at the same time has an undertone of fear.  In many distopia stories chaos and social decay are the villains, but here mechanical control without regard for personal rights is the evil as it forces people to become players whether or not they want to.",1030665600,,839,4.668918918918919
1043237,5,6305537402,"Cinema seems to create more urban legends than any other art form.  It is a measure of their success that the Brothers Quay have already reached the point where there is some confusion about their origins.  Whether Minnesota or Pennsylvania, we do know that they received their journeyman artistic training in Philadelphia and then moved to London, where they felt there was more opportunity for them than the U.S. had to offer.  There they developed a well-deserved reputation for being true masters of puppetry and miniaturist animation.
Experiencing a film produced by the Quays is a lot like watching a travelogue through one of those 19th Century cabinets of curiosities that vied with wax museums for the attention of a public that still had neither television or radio for entertainment.  Whichever way one looks one finds startling juxtapositions of objects whose immediate purpose is often not quite apparent.  Lost in the shadows are countless grotesqueries that claim our attention and defy us to extract their real significance.  For the Brothers Quay scenery is not the background to events, but an active, and sometimes overwhelming, participant.
Against this stage occupied with machines that require living juices to operate and drawers of ever changing objects move a cast of characters every bit as fantastical as those who people Franz Kafka's stories and diaries.  Brainless dolls seek content, eerie puppets of bent old men gain and lose their souls, and stuffed rabbits defend egg like beings from attack.  Disembodied hands perform erotic acts with ladders while in the background plays a soundtrack both familiar and obscure.  Across all run countless images of lines, bent and parallel, shadowed and real, perhaps acting as a surreal circulatory system that ties all these components together visually.
The inspiration for these cinematic expressions are many - Kafka's nightmares, the epic of Gilgamesh, poetry, and admiration for the creative genius of others.  Message is not paramount to the Quay's productions.  Or, more accurately, linear explicitness is viewed with some suspicion.  Explication arises instead from the interaction between the visible and the signified, and so varies from viewer to viewer.  I am reminded somehow of Joel-Peter Witkin's photographs, although the Quays' work lacks the horrific overtones that Witkin plays on.
The DVD offers the addition of 'Nocturna Artificialia,' the trailer for 'Institute Benjamenta,' and an interview with the Brothers Quay.  For some reason, the menu is not immediately apparent when using the video.  Rest assured, there is one, and you will need to find it to enjoy the extra features.  On the whole, this is a remarkable viewing experience.  The influence of the Quays has become pervasive, and this is certainly the best way to expand one's knowledge of a remarkable expression of cinematographic creativity.",1026604800,18,2899,5.322368421052632
1043238,5,6305537402,"Technical matters:
The reviewer here who said this DVD has some technical problems was right on. I am surprised more people haven't commented on this. The disk's menu, even when accessed with a remote, never fully materializes visually. Instead, there is a jittery pixelated shadow of the menu that, if you are lucky and patient, may allow you to navigate to the bonuses and special features. (This may take some work; the highlighter did not want to move off of selections 3 and 5 once on them.) Some people may not ever get this far, and might assume it is a disk that goes straight to the feature without any menu. But, believe me, there IS one; it is glitchy and you will be probably be lucky to see it at all. But bear in mind you NEED to see it in order to get to the disks bonuses.
Artistic matters:
I can understand some people being off-put by the artiness of these shorts. But part of the value of this disk, to me, is that it backs you off from the threshold of instant gratification and easy/glib comprehension that modern media sets for you. It is something like a trip through an ancient back country to the rooms of an old house that has been abandoned in place. The ravages of time are in themselves something awesome to behold, and there is something happening -- an odd dynamism-- even in this stillest of places.
The magic here is simply achieved in a way that may remind you of Cocteau's Beauty and The Beast. In one scene a stuffed toy rabbit pitches an egg up, and is instantaneously there, standing upside down on the grassy, forrested ceiling, to catch it before it lands. This appears to have been done with a simple flopping of the image, or a mirror. But you believe it, and it doesn't seem at all forced or affected, but rather, like part of a dream you want to follow to its irresistable conclusion. It is as unexplained and repetitious as a dream too, which may trouble some.
The fact that these films stretch from 1979 tells me that either the Quays have been extremely influential on graphic design and media in the following 2 decades, or that they had their fingers on the pulse of a lot that was coming down the pipeline starting in the late 70s. (It is hard to grasp that this stuff-- with such a high level of layering and degradation and ""treatment""-- was done before the Macintosh or Photoshop.) Most of the images in these films are photographed in duotone-rich monochrome and extreme selective focus, denoting a wide open aperture shooting in the near-dark.
The Quays may have coined the concept of ""art damage"" as we know it today. Anyone interested in graphic and media design will want this disk. If I harp on the Quays connection to graphic design, it is at least partly because typography plays so important a role in their films. Their film titles and credits, and their general handling of type, 15 years old and older, is still edgy stuff. Any designer could study it to deepen their own work.
Get this disk. Problems and all, it is a must have.",1025395200,5,2994,4.495412844036697
1043239,5,6305537402,"A few years back I saw ""Institute Benjamenta,"" the Quay Brothers' full-length live-action film, at some festival. I'd never heard of them before, but they blew me away like they blow everybody away. The B&W was just lovely. I left the theatre like Moses left Horeb.
Of course, the Quays are better known for their stop-motion shorts, and when I mentioned ""Benjamenta"" to a friend, he loaned me a tape with ""Street of Crocodiles"" and a few others. All the Tool and Chemical Bros and NIN videos aside, when I watched ""Crocodiles"" for the first time, I realized I had hit bedrock. The videos are just cheap and tawdry imitations.  Mark Romanek chips on this vibe but he's just aping Quay. Nor can you blame him. Once you've watched a band of empty-headed, hollow-eyed Victorian dolls perform bizarre experiments with raw meat and insects to a stabbing violin score, you walk away a changed featherless biped.
Well I condidered myself a fan, but I hadn't seen the half of the films on this DVD before I bought it. I had like a month of Quay-Samadhi. My personal favourites are the lovely B&W ""Stille Nachts.""  ""Dramolet"" examines the secret life of lead filings (animated in stop-motion!) and magnets, presided over by an incredibly weathered and threadbare doll-puppet with cracked face and glistening black eyes. Later ""Stille Nachts"" were videos for His Name Is Alive (never heard of them before this either), including ""Are We Still Married"" and ""Can't Go Wrong Without You,"" which feature the comedy duo of a veiled doll in striped socks that rocks back and forth ominously on its heels, and a decaying toy rabbit orbited by kinetic ping-pong balls. Also in this series is ""Tales From the Vienna Woods,"" which displays much of the symbolic imagery later used in ""Benjamenta:"" antlers and hooves and plaques in German, etc.
These films ""aren't for everybody;"" there I said it. But neither is ""You've Got Mail."" If you're interested in them at all, if you're reading this page but you actually haven't seen the films but they sound like your thing - if you're the ultimate sitting duck consumer, in other words - all I can say in this case is CONSUME. I doubt you'll regret it. And if you do, well, you have no taste anyway, so what do I care. By the way, it doesn't necessarily follow that if you love one film, you'll love em all, or """" if you hate. I have to be in a very rare mood to watch ""Crocodiles"" again (now that I've seen the others), but ""The Comb"" and ""Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies"" endlessly facinate me. Each piece has its own atomsphere.",1025136000,59,2556,4.677777777777778
7890924,5,6305537402,"The Brothers Quay were inspired much by Czech surrealist Jan Svankmajer. Watching these, it's impossible to miss his influence on their work.

7890925,4,6305537402,"The Quay Brothers are (according to Wikipedia) identical twin brothers, born in the United States but working in England. For the most part they have made stop-motion animated films with puppets and common household objects. Their work in this line, judging from this collection, is very similar to that of Czech stop-motion artist Jan Svankmajer; one of the best films in this collection is dedicated to him. They have also made at least two live-action feature films, The Piano-Tuner of Earthquakes and Institute Benjamenta.

This is one of several collections of short films by the Quay Brothers. I haven't bought the others, so I cant compare them, except to say that this is one of the less expensive ones. It contains ten short films, ranging from 21 minutes to one minute, made between 1984 and 1993; an additional film, Nocturna Artificialis, said to be the Brothers first, is one of the discs bonus features. Other bonus features include an all-animation film trailer for the live-action feature Institute Benjamenta and an interview with the brothers.

My favorites among the ten films, The Comb, The Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer, and Street of Crocodiles, were among the longer ones; some of the short ones, such as Cant Go Wrong Without You (originally a music video apparently, as were several of the others), also had interesting imagery but weren't long enough to allow much to be done with it. The best of the films were wonderfully weird, featuring such things as dolls with broken-open, hollow heads and a variety of usually inanimate objects that here take on a menacing life of their own.

If you like avant-garde, Surrealist-style animated film, you should definitely get this or one of the other Quay Brothers collections, as well as Svankmajers shorts and Alice, his feature-length take on Alice in Wonderland. However, it would have been nice if the films on this disc could have been restored in higher resolution; some of them are rather blurry and/or pixelated on a large TV screen.",1498953600,,2006,4.982089552238806

7890929,5,6305537402,"Heavily influenced by the folk tales told in the European neighborhood of Philadelphia they grew up in, the Quays exploit the more disturbing aspects of dolls and puppets. Common objects seem to rot before their lens. Broken tennis rackets become the most sinister of instruments. There is no concern for narrative structure, as the brothers have more artistic pretensions. You could roll any of their films in a loop and hang it on a wall.

The DVD presents 10 Quay shorts in order, or easily accessed via Kinos lovely animated menus:

THE CABINET OF JAN SVANKMAJER (1984, 14m): After some preliminaries, a boy doll visits a learned creature and has the contents of his head examined, then assists in a series of experiments. A tribute to the great Czech animator of the early days of cinema.

THE EPIC OF GILGAMESH, OR: THIS UNNAMEABLE LITTLE BROOM (1985, 11m): A clown-like officer on a small tricycle has many strange duties to perform. He melts some ice on a mechanized table. A bird creature steals a peek at a piece of meat and is snared.

THE STREET OF CROCODILES (1986, 21m): A man (Feliks Strawinski) frees a puppet, who wanders through a nightmarish loft. Roaming screws are harvested. Robotic exhibits perform behind glass. More ice melting on tables. Zombie dolls dance with him and re-stuff his head. The threads are rewound.

REHEARSALS FOR EXTINCT ANATOMIES (1987, 14m): A black and white short that plays with focus and perception. A mad wire mummy with a vibrating eye scratches a pimple in the code room. The threads escape, covering everything, to the surprise of mechanical critters. It seems a plague is spreading.

DRAMOLET (STILLE NACHT I) (1988, 1m): By now, MTV had discovered the brothers, and commissioned a series of shorts from them. As a hideous puppet watches, hairy mold grows everywhere around his shack. Then spoons. Short enough that you can see half of it in the menu preview.

THE COMB (FROM THE MUSEUMS OF SLEEP) (1991, 17m): A surprise after their previous works: the title object appears in the first shot! The hideous puppet from Dramolet returns in the brothers first widescreen effort. While climbing in the sun-dappled woods, suddenly the air grows hard, and his hands steal his ladder to explore a nearby loft. Will the sleeper be awakened?

ANAMORPHOSIS, OR: DE ARTIFICIALIA PERSPECTIVA (1991, 15m): The brothers first educational work, this film was commissioned to illustrate painting techniques that give three-dimensional illusion, sometimes hiding pictures within pictures. Narrated by Witold Schejbal.

ARE WE STILL MARRIED? (STILL NACHT II) (1991, 3m): A domestic disagreement: she refuses to open the door, despite his feverish knocking. The bunny is upset and the bouncing ball is agitated. Music by His Name is Alive.

TALES FROM THE VIENNA WOODS (STILL NACHT III) (1992 3m): A bizarre epitaph. A floating hand. Odd furniture. Suddenly, a shot rings out.

CANT GO WRONG WITHOUT YOU (STILL NACHT IV) (1993, 3m): This second music video for His Name is Alive features the same characters. This time, the Easter Bunny protects his eggs from the specter of Death, while the girl is bleeding.

The DVD has some additional bonus features not available on Kinos videotape release:

NOCTURNA ARTIFICIALIA (1979, 21m): An undead puppet creeps through the dark city. Sometimes he rides the phantom trolley. Is he dreaming? Am I? The boys first short, and their weakest, is still interminable.

Theres also a 4-minute interview with the brothers, in which they discuss their influences (Kafka, obviously), and how they feel about their work. Wrapping up the program is a theatrical trailer for the Quays feature film Institute Benjamenta, composed of shots from TALES FROM THE VIENNA WOODS intercut with title cards.

The films can be accessed individually through the main menu, or watched straight through as a feature. A package booklet insert contains excerpts from a Film Comment article by Michael Atkinson entitled The Night Countries of the Brothers Quay.

Kinos transfers are excellent  too many shaky still frames for an animation DVD, but the images and soundtrack are crystal clear.",1409184000,,4140,5.073637702503682
7890930,5,6305537402,"The Brothers Quay are geniuses and masters at stop motion filming and surrealism.  The worlds they create are masterfully done and are a complex world of surrealistic images that defy categorization.  Fantastically complex and ever changing and moving; you can watch these films many times and never fully see and absorb all that is in them because there is so much to see.  I have these collections and they are among my top favorite films of all time.

To quote Salvidor Dali the surrealist artist when he was describing his reaction to the surrealist writer, Comte de Lautreamont, ""this excites me to delirium !"".  That is my reaction to the Quay Brothers.  I am delirious with visual ecstasy when I watch them.

Amazing and astonishing in it's weirdness, this is an art film's art film.
So strange, that I find it difficult to relate just how strange it is. (!)
Also instructive - it teaches much about anamorphosis - how things can appear to be quite unlike what they might appear to be from a different angle.
Each of these ten black and white shorts have the feel of dreams - yet are distinctly different from each other.  If memory serves correctly, two of these films are essentially music videos.  I found the musical score for most of these pieces to be nearly as haunting as they are visually.
