7926855,3,B00004Y7GW,"I can think of worse forms of entertainment than seeing a young Cheryl Ladd and Kate Jackson conspiring with a teacher incarnation of Satan in an all girls school.
Comical, a little spooky and so so surreal.
B-movie classic.",1071360000,2,224,4.769230769230769
7926856,5,B00004Y7GW,"the 2000 telemovie of satans school for girls would have to be one of the best movies ive ever seen and a very impressive performance by the young actress who played lisa( actresses name unknown) who showed true character behind a gothic's personality and alot of the time innocence.truly a great performance by shannen doherty and wonderful producing by aaron spelling.
the best movie i'll ever see
if only it were avaliable to buy",1004486400,3,432,4.851351351351352
