3474336,4,B001AYWY72,"i've done the 3 second trimester workouts....because that is where i am in my pregnancy.  at first i thought i'd do all three at once for a 45 minute workout.  i learned quickly that that was unnecessary.  each one is a challenging full body workout.  most other pregnancy videos i've done have not been challenging enough or did not work the whole body.  this one surely does, safely....quads, hamstrings, butt, abs, back, shoulders, triceps, biceps, heart.
the equipment needed are light free weights, a stability ball, a resistance band, a chair and a towel.  i did not rate this video with 5 stars because in my opinion, a resistance band is not easy to use anywhere.  i am unable to anchor a band in the area i workout.  so instead of the band, i use free weights when i'm able or no resistance.",1222646400,12,800,4.545454545454546
3474347,2,B001AYWY72,"I didn't find Gabby very engaging or fun to watch. I only did this DVD once. I would recommend the one with Summer Sanders. She is funny and entertaining, and I did that dvd throughout my entire pregnancy!",1304294400,,205,4.421052631578948
3474348,2,B001AYWY72,"While the exercises themselves were okay, there was A LOT of switching between props. I felt like it wasn't a very efficient workout because I kept having to stop to put aside one prop and get the next one. I do like that it's divided into the different months, and I liked Gabrielle Reece's attitude.",1301961600,3,301,4.490909090909091
3474349,3,B001AYWY72,"I will start out by saying that the exercises in this video are good and effective. I feel much stronger since starting them out and feel safe in undertaking them knowing that a professional designed them for pregnancy. Having said that, there are several issues to keep in mind before buying this DVD. It requires many different types of equipment that the average exerciser may not have on hand such as stability ball, band and hand weights. Worst of all, however, is the requirements for a a partner or steady chair, bedpost or wall, which were impossible in my case. I had to sit out several parts of the video for that reason. I also want to note that some of the footage is creepy. There are so may close-ups of Ms. Reece's burgeoning body that it often prevents the viewer from seeing how she is positioned. The banal talk between her and the trainer is also leaves a lot to be desired. Nonetheless, if you can stand these drawbacks, you can get a decent workout.",1294876800,,970,4.517045454545454
3474350,4,B001AYWY72,"This is a good workout DVD, but I haven't used it as much as I have the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Prenatal-Pilates/dp/B000RIWARG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates</a>"" that I purchased at the same time. The workouts are good, don't seem too long and there is a good variety. However (and this may be just me) I thought the way it was shot was kind of weird. There were lots of times when the camera was focused in on one specific body part (so when I was just learning the exercises I couldn't see what her whole body was doing.) I felt like it must have been filmed by a man, ""ok, I realize she has amazing abs/shoulders/butt/etc... I'd like to see what the heck she's doing...."" Also, the warm up and cool down are separate from the work outs so you have to select each one when you're doing them on the DVD, not too bad but not as motivational for a lazy non-exerciser like me. :)",1283644800,2,977,4.927272727272728
3474351,3,B001AYWY72,"About me: I am 7 months along and work out daily.  I consider myself (pre-pregnancy) a high intermediate/low advanced exerciser.  About the dvd:  Some reviewers have complained that you need a lot of equipment for this workout, but as a pretty committed home exerciser, I already had everything.  I do agree they should allow more time for set-up between exercises (maybe 20 minute express workouts instead of 15?)  When her trainer is holding onto her resistance band, I am looking for something that I can anchor mine to that won't move.  My desk and my coffee table didn't work- both moved.  They are already on to the next move while I haven't completed one rep.  After a few uses I have been able to plan ahead for these things and actually execute the workout, which I now find (after all this) isn't even challenging.  I bought this because it was rated advanced and I don't agree that it is.  My heart rate NEVER got up, whereas it typically would moving quickly from exercise to exercise in a weight training routine.  Most of the exercises are adequate, but nothing special, and I find that there is too much chatter between Gabrielle and her trainer.  With the other problems already outlined combined with the low challenge, this dvd wasn't a good purchase for me- so far.  I am holding out hope that I can find use for the post-natal segments once my baby arrives.",1281916800,,1377,4.640495867768595
3474352,2,B001AYWY72,"The workout was ok, but they move very quickly from one exercise to another and one prop to another with very little warning. Also, the trainer is handing her props and getting things in place for her as she goes while I was trying to do the workout on my own, with a bigger belly than Ms. Reece, frantically moving around an exercise ball and chair and weights and so on. The exercises done on the ball were pretty uncomfortable as well and the trainer was often providing partner support and telling the audience last minute: you may need to put your ball/back/hand against a wall or have a partner for this one, while they are already proceeding with the exercise.",1278374400,,667,4.520661157024794
3474353,5,B001AYWY72,"If you are looking for a pregnancy fitness DVD, in my opinion this is the best one out there.  Very manageable length for routines (15 mins each not including warm-up & cool down) and yet you still feel like you've done something good for your body -- and of course you can always add more routines on if you want.  9 different routines for 9 months.  The emphasis is not on getting a super-fit body, it's about taking care of yourself and maintaining good physical health to be able to get back into good shape after pregnancy.  And if you like the style & pace of this  video, AVOID the Denise Austin one -- she's the total opposite of Gabrielle Reece's down-to-earth attitude.
Props that you will want to do the routines to their full extent: a yoga mat (or something you can kneel on that won't slip), an exercise band, 2 sets of light free weights (maybe a 5 lbs. set & a 8 / 10lbs. set -- or whatever you are comfotable with), a medium sized exercise ball, and a sturdy chair to lean on.",1275523200,,993,4.288770053475936
3474354,4,B001AYWY72,"I worked out regularly for a year before my second pregnancy and really challenged myself with interval training and serious weight workouts.  Still, when I began the Gabrielle Reece Complete Fit and Healthy Pregnancy, I felt the moves challenged my muscles safely.  That has been great.  I began with month 1 and have used it through my entire pregnancy into month 9, where I am currently.  I really like Gabby's attitude throughout the workouts and the moves are designed by her trainer whom I believe has a degree in exercise physiology and really knows his stuff.  THAT SAID, different workouts at various stages in this process have been very frustrating for a few reasons.  You have to have A LOT of props: a chair that is very sturdy that you can also move by yourself very quickly, an exercise band, dumb bells at around 2 pounds, dumb bells at around 5 lbs, an exercise ball, an extra large bath towel or bath sheet, and different solid objects to wrap the band around at different heights that can support a fair amount of weight (I had a treadmill and a rowing machine that fit the bill here).  While Gabby has her trainer helping her transition between and set up for different moves, most exercisers will not have an assistant and that can be very annoying.  At times, they wanted you to have your head and neck on the exercise ball, a foot on the chair, and ""now grab your dumb bells"" - yeah right!  I'm pregnant!  I found ways to make it work and the workouts ARE effective, but there were times when I was learning a new workout for the month that I wanted to kick Mike the trainer.  I had to keep the remote close because I usually had to pause while I set up for the next move.  Gabby and Mike transitioned very quickly and were a few reps into it before I was ready to go.  Also, the person who filmed it might need a kick for zooming in on Gabby's face way too much.  I had to do lots of rewinding to get a glimpse of her entire body performing a move so I could figure out what I was supposed to be doing.  Overall, if you are a committed exerciser who wants a challenging and safe program and you're willing to put up with some inconvenience to make it work - this DVD is worth it.  I gave it 4 stars for effectiveness and because I really like Gabby Reece.  The missing star is for the sometimes ridiculous amount of work to transition between and set up for the various moves.",1268179200,6,2400,4.345291479820628
3474355,5,B001AYWY72,"I bought her shorter prenatal video first, and bought this one to replace it because it is the same but with some additional workouts, third trimester workout, and postnatal workout...So It is pretty much the same so I am placing a similar review here... (Hey, it can't be bad I am paying for almost the same video twice!)

First I must say I read a lot of reviews addressing how great Gabby is, how they didn't like her trainer, or the background, or the quality, or buying the ball, weights and band. On the equipment, Ball $2 at Tjmax, the band and light weights $4.50 at Play It Again Sports. This is 258 minutes of video for $9.99, still a great deal with the added $6.50 in equipment. The rest who cares, it's just cosmetic. On the actual video, the warm ups and cool downs are great, I use them to augment some of my other videos that don't have good warm ups or cool downs. Also if I am really short on time in the morning, I just do the warm up and go, or in the evening I will just do the cool down, it is better then nothing. The workouts are simple, quick, and fast pace, which is why I bought them, for days when I don't have a lot of time. If one of the workouts isn't enough for you just repeat it as a circuit, or pause the video and do extra reps of each exercise. I do not recommend ever doing a workout that isn't for your trimester and month of pregnancy. I really liked that the workouts are completely different for each month of your trimester for the first two trimesters, you can really get board of the same workout. The exercises are good, safe, and challenging, most of them are different from all the other videos I have reviewed. I am also very happy to finally have safe abdominal work explained for the second trimester, such as splinting your abs.

 Also a lot of workout videos don't have a specific third trimester workout and I am glad to find one that does, with my last pregnancy I ended up quitting all workouts except walking at that point, because your body really slows you down and everything I did before that point was just to much.

3474356,2,B001AYWY72,"I'm not saying this was a ""bad"" workout tape by any means, but to me the exercises were for someone who has never worked out.  They were VERY SIMPLE and I was looking for something much more challenging.",1265587200,,203,4.342105263157895
3474357,3,B001AYWY72,"I enjoyed this DVD throughout my pregnancy because it was challenging enough to get my heart rate up and really work my muscles.  Also, the nine completely distinct workout routines helped keep me from getting bored.  The only downside is that the exercises require many props (stability ball, weights, chair, fitness bands).  If you don't already have these props (especially the ball and weights), you will not benefit from this DVD because there are no modifications shown for those without props.",1263772800,,500,5.148148148148148
3474358,1,B001AYWY72,"I found this video good for mothers-to-be who are already fit.  Many of the moves are quite intricate and I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't already accustumed to Pilates, the exercise ball, and other props used in the video.  The trainer Reece works with suggests pulling a door (!) to replace a person when performing a stretch.  I assume he means pulling a door knob, but I don't find that to be very practical.  He also suggests using a chair yet he stands there holding it while Reece uses it in order to avoid it tilting!",1263340800,,530,4.43298969072165
3474359,4,B001AYWY72,"I thought there were a good variety of workouts included on the DVD. I like that the workouts are only fifteen minutes, so I can always find time to sneak in a workout.",1260230400,,168,4.121212121212121
3474360,1,B001AYWY72,"I had high hopes for this workout, and even bought a fitness ball and band to use with it.  but i was very disappointed.  it is a very low budget workout and doesn't even have background music.  and after each move gabrielle rolls her eyes and says ""ooooh that feels so good.""  honestly, every single workout can't feel that good (and they don't).  and for each move they teach there is a yoga or pilates equivalent that is easier to do correctly and stretches your muscles at the same time.  i used this dvd for a few months but found myself modifying most of the segnments with pilates moves i knew that got the job done better.  so i stopped using it.  i do not recommend buying this dvd.",1259107200,,691,4.3023255813953485
3474361,3,B001AYWY72,This is a great tape if you can't normally find time in the day to workout.  The workouts are 15 minutes- I wish they were a little longer but great exercies for preparing for the big day.,1257811200,2,188,4.081081081081081
3474362,4,B001AYWY72,"I really enjoyed this video. I liked that it focused on toning and core strengthening. I read some of the other reviews before buying and I agree that it is a little low budget in production. It's just Gabrielle and her trainer and a very boring set. I also thought that it could have be put together a little better. For example, the warm up and cool down are all separate segments. It would have been better to make those segments apart of each month's workout for a better flow.

You will need several pieces of workout equipment. If you are a home gymer like me you probably already have most of the necessary equipment. I do like the Gabrielle is pregnant and although she is in good shape she has trouble with some of the moves too. So, it makes it more believable that anyone can do it.

Even though it is only 15 min segments you get a pretty good workout. If you are feeling really energized you can do 2 segments together. I did month 1 and 2 yesterday and I felt great after the workout. Overall, I would recommend this video for people that like core training workouts and something that is a little challenging.",1251072000,2,1124,4.373205741626794
3474363,4,B001AYWY72,"As a one time Atlete, Gabrielle Reece has always been a role to me. She embodies HEALTH. Her goal with her pregnancy DVDs is to empower women to do something good for themeselve. Exersice shouldnt be about shrinking  down to a cookie cutter body image, it should be about obtaining a healthy body. I like that she designed her system to accomadate the needs and restrictions for each trimester. Also, Reece has made it so that you can opt to do brief work outs. If you are looking for a strnous work out, look in to your self to figure out why? Your weight and your pant size should be the last thing you are worried about while pregnant. Focus on gaining a healthy weight (around 25 to 35 pounds) and concentrate on keeping your body strong to sustain your growing belly. Understand that the media tells us that we need to get thin fast after our pregnancy, and this should not be the case. It takes a year for our bodies to recuperate after giving birth. Focus on getting your body back together, not getting your body back into jeans.",1248134400,7,1037,4.429319371727749
3474364,3,B001AYWY72,"I couldn't do this workout because I didn't have any of the equipment.  I don't have a yoga ball, I don't have elastic bands, and I didn't have arm weights at the time.  I am sure this is a great DVD if you have everything needed to participate.",1247356800,2,245,4.083333333333333
3474365,1,B001AYWY72,"I thought the video was boring and kind of weird.  Gabrielle is great in the video but the trainer with her is not the best.  I would skip this one and recommend denise austins ""fit and firm pregnancy"" video.  If you can get past her bugged out bubbly nature it's a really great preggo video.",1244678400,,292,4.2727272727272725
3474366,5,B001AYWY72,"I was afraid that a 15 minute workout wouldn't do the trick, but these workouts are just enough to feel more toned. I have been walking for 20 minutes, then doing one of the workout routines a few times a week throughout my second semester. I love Gabrielle and I am confident that the exercises are safe during pregnancy. I wish that I had bought this sooner! The only downside is that you really need an exercise ball, bands and weights.",1244592000,,439,4.432098765432099
3474367,2,B001AYWY72,"If you want a very brief workout, this video is for you. I thought I'd string together 2 or 3 of the 15-minute workouts to make one longer workout, but found that each segment is too choppy to do that and have an effective workout.

Each exercise is only done for 4 or 5 reps, so I felt like I spent most of the time switching exercises rather than doing one.

Gabby is sweet, though, and adds real-mom commentary as she's doing the exercises. I would love this video if each exercise was just repeated 10-15 times, but then it would no longer be a 15-min workout.",1244073600,9,564,4.261682242990654
3474368,4,B001AYWY72,"This is a great workout for women who want to keep strengthening and conditioning throughout their pregnancy... but I get so frustrated at the parts when the resistance band is required to be held on to by someone or ""anchored to an object."" As if I am going to pause the DVD to tie the band to my couch, and then pause to untie it! Fortunately I already had the other equipment for the DVD, but would have been REALLY upset if I hadn't. Included in the third trimester workouts are some that require you to put your balance ball up against a wall, which I'm sorry, I refuse to put my ball that rolls around on the floor up onto my nicely painted walls. It also suggests putting your feet up on the wall to intensify, which is just ridiculous. Good thing I have an ugly solid door to use. Too bad I can't see my TV from that door. Overall I would say the workout is really good, though it has definite drawbacks. I do 3 of the month sections per workout, so I'm going for more than an hour, and your heart rate does get up there if you're doing the moves properly, contrary to some of the other reviewers, as you're using large muscle groups and alternating upper and lower body moves. I can't wait to do the postnatal workout.",1240185600,,1227,4.247863247863248

3474370,3,B001AYWY72,"This video is good for someone who is looking for a little harder strengthening routine while pregnanat.  You do require a lot of equipment such as swiss ball, resistance bands, and free weights.  I felt that they went a little too fast through the workout.  By the time I was in position and starting the exercise I only had time to do about 5 repetitions beefore they were moving on to the next exercise.

3474373,4,B001AYWY72,"I haven't tried all of the 9 months worth of workout videos, yet, nor the postnatal workouts, but I can already tell this is an excellent video workout for the seasoned gym rat. My biggest question about my workouts when I found out I was pregnant was, ""What can I and can I absolutely NOT do?"" My trainer said she had seen women do everything they normally did until the day of delivery, which definitely did not answer my question. My doctor had different recommendations. She said I should be able to work out and talk the whole time, which is not something I could do in my pre-pregnancy routine.

I find that this video has it all - it combines the strength and weight training I was doing before in shorter and lighter doses with helpful recommendations for modifications for the pregnant woman. It includes a warm up and cool down for every workout. What you really need to know is that equipment is required for this workout. Dumbbells, a yoga mat, an exercise ball, and a band. There may be more to come; I have really only done the second trimester workouts so far. I am very impressed with the quality of the video as well as the information, and I highly recommend this product.",1234742400,,1190,4.483870967741935
3474374,5,B001AYWY72,"I bought this DVD exactly one year ago as I was just entering my 2nd trimester of pregnancy.  After the ""I'm pregnant, I can eat whatever I want!"" mindset helped me pack on unnecessary extra weight, I decided to take things a little more seriously.  One comment said that there was no cardio - that is true.  However, I would pop this DVD in AFTER a good walk around town.  Also, I would try to do 2 if not 3 of the workouts at a time.
Great workout, I was usually sweating beads when I was finished. Yes, there are several needed props (3-5 & 8-10lb weights, fitness ball, towel, resistance band), but they tell you things you can use to substitute.  I actually felt that they made the workout more interesting and fun to follow.
Anyway, I strongly recommend this - just don't use it as your ONLY form of exercise.  The workouts only go up to 6 months, but I was using this DVD right up until 40 weeks!

8280259,5,B001AYWY72,"This is a phenomenal video.  I teach full time, so when I became pregnant with my first child, I needed a video that I could fit in my busy schedule.  This video gives meaningful instructions about how to exercise safely.  The video's emphasis is toning muscles, rather cardio, but this is what I needed to strengthen myself before labor.  I loved how Gabrielle and her physical trainer designed different routines for each month of pregnancy and also for the 3 months after the birth of the child.  I was a bit bored by other videos because they have only 1 routine for the entire program.

I have a 4 yr old, a 2 yr old and now a 6 week newborn.
