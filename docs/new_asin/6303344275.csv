The opening bit with Dame Edna Everage (Barry Humphries CBE in drag) is cute and funny though. She flies to London, England; shops at Harrods' department store in Knightbridge and stops by Buckingham Palace where she picks up a Queen Elizabeth II celebrity impersonator and brings her to the Queens Theatre. Joan does her usual standup routine comedy with some below the belt humor as well. The hour long is episode is satisfactory.

I thought there was a connection to American comedienne and television personality, Ruby Wax, but there isn't unfortunately. Joan Rivers jokes about being single and married. She jokes about being a woman and jokes about celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor; Imelda Marcos; and others. Her jokes now are somewhat dated and lame at times.

If you like Joan Rivers, you might enjoy this nostalgic trip back to 1992 as Joan struggled to rebuild her career and name brand. She had a successful talk show at the time in New York City but she was always a workaholic.",1516924800,,1133,4.895833333333333
