8431939,2,B004JL14AQ,"The Legendary Collection from Joy Sales is a collection of films from the vault owned by distributor Fortune Star. This line is one I have a love/hate relationship for. I love it as they dug out some really great, obscure titles for fans of Hong Kong cinema but their transfers can be real hit and miss. The great forgotten actioner Fury is sadly miss.

Fury is brought to us by the D&B production studio, the same studio that graced us with the amazing In the Line of Duty franchise (which includes <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes-Madam/dp/B001ARY846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes Madam</a>, <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Royal-Warriors/dp/B0001NBMNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Royal Warriors</a> and legendary fourth entry <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Line-of-Duty-4/dp/B0000V46DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Line of Duty 4</a> featuring the astonishing Donnie Yen in an early role). ""Fury"", like those, is a great late 80's actioner full of grit and violence. Why is it forgotten? Perhaps it got overshadowed by the superior films of the same genre or for the fact that has a completely forgettable title. Though not a superior example of the heroic bloodshed genre kick started by Woos A Better Tomorrow series, fans will find much to like here. I will be honest I enjoyed the hell out of it.

My problem is with the transfer. Now I get these films are obscure and its not profitable for restoration. For that reason I am used to scratches, fading and other such impurities that grace Hong Kong cinema from the mid-90s and earlier (as fans know, southeast Asian countries in general are widely known for poor storage of their precious film negatives). The problem is the damage to the original film elements makes the picture jittery and the image moves up and down for a majority of the picture. I figured at first the annoyance would pass but to my dismay it continued for a majority of the film and hindered my enjoyment of the movie considerably. It would have been nice if Joy Sales would have put a little more effort into the transfer to at least make the picture not so jumpy.

Buying a Legendary Collection DVD from Joy Sales is like playing fire. Sure most of the time I am happy with my purchase but occasionally I get burned from a nearly unwatchable transfer (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Fiery-Family/dp/B00BYJTNEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Fiery Family</a> suffers from the exact same annoying transfer). And considering these DVDs can only be purchased as imports with a slightly higher cost makes it a constant gamble for fans of these films since reviews are sparse on the internet to warn them of poor transfers. I highly recommend the movie Fury, but highly disapprove of the DVD release unless you are even more forgivable than me for poor source elements. I ended up selling my DVD which saddens me since I enjoyed the movie itself.

Instead I would recommend buying <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angry-Ranger/dp/B0021TVZG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angry Ranger</a>, <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Profile-in-Anger/dp/B00OKXXR8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Profile in Anger</a>, <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Heat/dp/B007GDEAUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Heat</a>, City War, Forbidden Arsenal, Sea Wolves or <a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bloody-Fight/dp/B01GUOULSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bloody Fight</a> DVDs from the Legendary Collection line.
