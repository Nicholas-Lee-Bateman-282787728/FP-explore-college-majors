8189593,4,B000P6RBZ6,Really fun and some good and entertaining taiko. Really inspiring to see the kids with so much commitment to this art practice. These folks deserve a lot of support.,1463529600,,165,4.724137931034483
8189594,3,B000P6RBZ6,"I had high expectations for this DVD, so perhaps it's unfair to say I was disappointed, because there are some really great parts, but there are some not so good parts as well.  For variety of styles, extra material and video quality it is good, but the ability of some of the performers is not too impressive and less than half of the disk is performed by Taiko Project!  So the twirls and high speed tricks they do were really limited to a couple of songs.  Even Omiyage was performed by other groups!  Still worth it though.",1219881600,2,527,4.402061855670103
8189595,4,B000P6RBZ6,Taiko project has taken a classic old world style of japanese music and modernized it with some hip-hoppish twists. They are all excellent musicians and being based out of California i can see their western influences in the music. But they mesh it well without disgracing the traditional music. This disc even has a bit of situation comedy on the part of the announcer and a children's group that performs. I've been practicing taiko for nearly a year and the children on this disc are far better than i am.,1218585600,,508,4.655555555555556

8189597,5,B000P6RBZ6,"If you love Taiko, you will love this CD. TAIKOPROJECT does Taiko with a uniquely Hip Hop twist. The choreography is as amazing as the drumming. And, the drumming is thrilling. All four groups [adults, college age, youth and the professional group [TAIKOPROJECT] have a different, but related, flavor -- and are all fun to listen to and to watch. Watch the CD and you will want to see them in a live performance.",1192320000,2,412,4.581081081081081
8189598,5,B000P6RBZ6,"I really liked it. I thought it was really entertaining. Great dancing. The drum routines were really creative. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

My husband was sitting on the end of his seat through the whole thing with a big smile on his face. He kept saying ""Wow! This is great!""

The colors and the different types of drums they used were amazing. There were all age groups -- little kids, teenagers, adults, and old people. All of them were packed full of energy and it made the show really different.

Really glad we went!",1192060800,,520,4.51063829787234
