8758547,3,B01EG1PVCA,"Decent amount of gore, but the story fell apart at the end. The subtitles showed up well after the characters had spoken so it was difficult to follow. Some characters motivations didn't make sense. Buy it for the gore only. Don't expect a good story.",1530144000,,251,4.6

cover looks like a sci-fi movie but just about sone sick killing without points... the director should have watched Seven first...",1485388800,,232,5.297297297297297
8758550,5,B01EG1PVCA,Ok well if you don't like gore not only are you boring but you will also not like this movie. This movie starts off a little slow but get very interesting very quick. The special effects are pretty good. The acting is believeable and they look the part there playing unbelievably well. It had a couple unique moments and ideas that I haven't seen in any other movie before and I've seen a lot of horror movies. It also stays pretty close and true to its original short film. And the ending is just as adorable as the rest of the movie! I give it a 10/10. That's my opinion.,1485216000,3,573,4.218181818181818

8758552,3,B01EG1PVCA,It's a brutal violent movie but didn't live up to the hype for how extreme it was suppose to be.,1481155200,,96,3.85
8758553,5,B01EG1PVCA,Perfect brutal and gory. My Favorit this year.,1477785600,,46,4.875
8758554,3,B01EG1PVCA,"I've seen more graphic then this. It was alright and worth a watch but the production of the Blu-ray issue par. Whoever did the subtitles should never work on another film. Misspelled words and dialogue displaying well after a character spoke. The story has too many holes and is just poorly written. Really, only watch this for the gore, nothing else.",1477526400,3,352,4.786885245901639
8758555,5,B01EG1PVCA,"This is something special. It's more than just torture and gore, there is plenty of hardcore violence, but it does have great creative use of found footage scenes edited into the main movie which is shot in HD. It's a murder investigation and they're finding these murders on tape, and grilling the killer over the footage and trying to find out where the bodies were dumped. There's a really clever narrative that leads to some crazy twists that are all perfectly built up, and there's a big twist ending, which I've seen some reviewers not understand the first time through, but I got it. I consider this to be the underground horror equivalent to The Usual Suspects. Nothing said or shown is just there. It all builds to the main plot and the twists, there are some flashbacks later on and things to keep you from getting too lost. It's more about telling a grizzly story, and the most disgusting scenes of violence are saved for the last found video tape. I'd rank the violence close to the first August Underground and a bit of AU's Mordum, just this is a bit more restrained and focused than Mordum, which helps.",1476230400,2,1118,4.595
8758556,5,B01EG1PVCA,"""Atroz will make you never want to tour Mexico! I can fully understand why Cannibal Holocaust director Ruggero Deadato fully backs Lex Ortegas graphic horror film an associate producer and presenter as the two films, separated by decades, are much alike with the majority of their likeness in found footage techniques, frighteningly realistic imitations of murder, and their artistic and austere grandeur of filmmaking narration. Ortega also sustains an effective horror feature through the confines of a problematic ultra micro-budget. Along with aid from a talented roster of actors and crew, no way was Ortegas film was not being made.""
