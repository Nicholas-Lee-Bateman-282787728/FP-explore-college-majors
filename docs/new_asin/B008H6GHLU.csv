5163518,5,B008H6GHLU,These are classics and well worth the price.  You get four movies and the quality is great. The old classic of Shaggy Dog with Fred Mcmurray and the new with Tim Allen plus the Shaggy DA and The Ugly Dachshund. Just great family viewing.,1376092800,7,237,4.386363636363637
5163519,5,B008H6GHLU,"I loved traveling down memory lane watching the older Shaggy Dog.  Even the three boys I showed it to this weekend liked it.....of course, wouldn't you know they liked the new version with Tim Allen better.  They loved the action when the song ""Who let the dogs out?"" played.

Good wholesome family fun movies.",1375660800,7,310,4.703703703703703

5163548,5,B008H6GHLU,"My wife and I really enjoyed watching these movies together! It's always great to see the cultural changes from era to era!  For example: the two single beds instead of one larger bed in the bedroom of the couple in ""The Ugly Dachshund"" were the cultural norm for the time in which this movie took place!  I find these details fascinating!",1519257600,,339,4.540983606557377
5163549,5,B008H6GHLU,"Normal DVD quality audio and video.  Better than VHS and haven't seen these out on BD, or I'd have picked that up instead.  Includes B&W and colorized versions for the original Shaggy Dog.  I prefer the B&W because it was shot with B&W lighting and textures in mind.  Color version doesn't quite look right.",1516147200,3,307,4.62962962962963

5163632,5,B008H6GHLU,"I mainly wanted this set for the ""Shaggy Dog"" and ""Shaggy D.A."", to send to my grand-kids, but having ""The Ugly Dachshund"" was a bonus. I don't believe I've seen that one again since it was in theaters when I was a kid, decades ago. All of those are good, clean Disney fun. The original ""Shaggy Dog"" was produced when Walt Disney was still alive and shows his special whimsical vision for family entertainment. I'm not familiar with the re-make with Tim Allen, but the the ones with Fred McMurray and Dean Jones are good clean Disney fun.",1465516800,8,538,4.5
