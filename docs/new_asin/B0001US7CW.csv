It comprises a long gig from 83,followed by 4 tracks left out from the Sexual Favours VHS/DVD (highly recommended) and superb footage of their first american tour,plenty of funny dialogues,situations,and takes of the audience. The sound is overall bad and imbalanced but listenable,with good bottom end;the american tour part is best left to your TV set speakers. Picture quality is FAR better than I'd expected,in fact I found it an excellent VHS tranfer. WARNING:FOR FANS ONLY !!! If you want pristine sound and Spielberg-quality picture and camera angles get the Beat Em All DVD.I'd kill for a Live In Japan 91/Buenos Aires 93 double header DVD,people at Cherry Red PLEASE take note !!!!",1127347200,,827,5.036496350364963
