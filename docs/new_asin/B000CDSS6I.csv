8097942,3,B000CDSS6I,"In late spring, 1981, ""two children playing in a vacant lot in Queens, NY, made a grisly discovery. They had stumbled on the decomposing body of ""Sonny Red"" Indelicato, a mobster who had gone missing just three weeks before.""

The FBI knows that this is from a power struggle in the Bonnano crime family, but they don't know that there are more bodies buried in the lot until they fully excavate 23 years later, in 2004.

The immediate effect of Sonny Red's murder, though, is that by July, 1981,  it's too dangerous for Joe Pistone to remain in his undercover role as Donnie Brasco, jewel thief. Pistone, now retired from the FBI,  is one of the people interviewed for this show, strolling down a Queens neighborhood street in a natty suit. And someone off-camera with a long memory hollers ""Rat!"" while the camera is rolling.

""Gangland Graveyard"" first aired in November 2006. It is about that vacant lot, its contents, what lead up to the murders and what happened after.  It is interesting, though it seems we've seen this story before. I just ordered this disc in December 2016, and was very surprised to find that there are no subtitles available on the disc.

It does direct you to the PBS website, though, where you can find additional background detail on the NY crime families, and a longer interview with the District Attorney who worked on the case.

The show is nicely done, but not as fascinating as some episodes of ""Secrets of the Dead"". 3.4 stars rounded down to 3.

8097943,5,B000CDSS6I,"My mother and I used to walk down Graham Avenue past Emily's Pork Store, Graham Avenue Meat Market and the bar these guys hung out in almost every week when she wanted to shop at Scaturro's supermarket just off of Metropolitan Avenue. Little did we know what was going on behind those barroom walls. A great insight into how the mob really works and thankfully free of bad re-enactments.",1363824000,,387,4.6231884057971016
8097944,3,B000CDSS6I,"Most ""Secret of the Dead"" installments involve corpses from a long time ago and far, far away.  This covered dead bodies found in NYC about three decades ago.  Unlike the other installments where the focus is interpreting corpses, this work had much more to do with why the victims died.  This felt more like an episode of ""Forensic Files"" than other installments.  I wonder if the series is trying to attract the many people that find the Mafia and Mafia films fascinating.

I did learn some stuff about corpses.  For example, this said you can differentiate between a bullet wound and a non-bullet puncture.  However, this was mostly two things: 1) praise to Pistone/""Donnie Brasco"" and 2) a display of what happens when the FBI catches Mafiosos.  I never saw the ""Brasco"" film, but fans of it may love this non-fictional work.  When the FBI catches ""bad guys,"" some rat, but others willingly die rather than betray their peers.

This work had lots of chest hair, spaghetti, and olive skin.  However, mobsters weren't called things like ""The Ox,"" ""The Hammer,"" or ""Babyface.""  There is a violent murder spree reenacted here and the sensitive should be careful in watching it.",1297296000,,1177,4.85929648241206
8097945,5,B000CDSS6I,"I assume bodies are now being buried more deeply.  This is primarily a show about a rare FBI infiltration at a low level of one NYC Mob Family which eventually snags the new Don: Massino.  Massino could have been put away for any number of crimes, but his elimination of his intrafamily rivals in a scheme against ""code"" ultimately comes to haunt him when his underlings also go against the ""code"" in testifying about this murder (Massino then also becomes a government informant).

This new generation ....
