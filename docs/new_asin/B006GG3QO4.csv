8497521,1,B006GG3QO4,"This movie was poorly directed, poorly acted and looked like someone's home movie. The characters made no sense, the acting was terrible, the actors were horribly unattractive- especially the ugly guy w/ rotten teeth and no talent. Avoid this ""film""- if you can even call this home movie w/ no talent or intelligence at all. A waste of this lesbians time. Gracias losers!",1475193600,,371,4.904761904761905

8497524,5,B006GG3QO4,"Some FANTASTIC singing in ""POP-U-larity!"", who knew?

Some not-so-great singing too... oh well... it's a small town, yo!

The ""Darque"" character and Hippie-Healer girl were funny.",1323993600,2,179,5.846153846153846
