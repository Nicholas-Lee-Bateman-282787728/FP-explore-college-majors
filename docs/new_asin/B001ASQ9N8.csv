3466939,5,B001ASQ9N8,"I was pretty happy about this box set. Compared to other anime box sets this actually comes with some special features that are pretty watchable. It's also great having 20 episodes in one boxed set, and the translations are actually pretty good compared to the Naruto boxed sets. So if you are a fan of this series it is a must buy. Can't wait till the third season comes out!",1221091200,,376,4.385714285714286
3466940,3,B001ASQ9N8,"While there are several other reviews regarding the show itself, I'm going to focus primarily on the technical aspects of the box set. After all, I figure if you're looking for season 2, you already know what the show is about.

The box set itself is sharp looking and made the same as the first season. It's made in 'book' format, which, in my opinion, is a lot more easy to handle than the usual fold-out box sets. While the first season had a poster of Ichigo with character reference sketches on the back of it, this Ichigo poster is blank on the back. There is no inclusion of a paper with the episode titles, which I wish they did. While all you see on the screen are episode numbers, each one does, indeed, have an official title that would make locating favorite episodes much easier.

The special on this set focuses on four voice actors: Michelle Ruff (Rukia), Wally Wingert (Renji), Spike Spencer (Hanataro), and Dan Woren (Byakuya). They discuss their opinions on their characters, as well as voice acting itself. I'm not sure how long it was, but it was long enough to enjoy.

If you are looking for good subtitles, these are mediocre. They pretty much keep to the dubbing 'rules'. For example, they don't keep character names as the Japanese VA says them, but always their first name. Chad is always put as 'Chad', even if Ichigo is not the one speaking. They also leave off any honorifics (-kun, -san, -chan, etc) in the subs. If you're picky about that (as I am), it can be pretty irritating. Viz releases always seem to be this way, however.
They sub the opening and ending themes as well.

While they claim the episodes are uncut, and the main body of the episodes are indeed whole, they do not include the Shinigami Golden shorts. I'm not sure if the Japanese DVD releases have them, but I know that they've started by now, even if all these particular episodes only are character introductory ones. I only hope that when they actually are little side stories, Viz includes them on the DVDs. This complaint is particularly confusing as they even dubbed Kon's announcement that they would start soon in one of the episode previews.

All that aside, $40 (as of today) is a fantastic price for an entire season of a great anime.",1220745600,32,2244,4.5721393034825875
3466941,4,B001ASQ9N8,"The first season of ""Bleach"" ended with Ichigo, Uryu, Chad, Orihime and the cat Yoruichi leaving the living world for the Soul Society, intent on saving Rukia.

But getting there isn't the least of their problems. The second major arc of the ""Bleach"" series -- called ""The Entry"" -- continues our heroes' quest to rescue Rukia from a death sentence, but they run into a new set of obstacles. It's pretty divided between action, slapstick and exposition, as well as a series of mysteries and conspiracies -- and a lot of likable new characters.

Ichigo and Co. narrowly make it into the Soul Society, almost losing Uryu along the way. And unfortunately -- between lethal captains and a building-sized Gatekeeper -- it's almost impossible to get inside the Soul Reapers' fortress, the Seireitei. Their only way inside is to ask an eccentric friend of Yoruichi's, a fireworks expert called Kukaku Shiba, to blast them (and her rough-edged brother Ganju) inside the Seireitei from the sky.

But surprisingly, being shot into orbit with a giant cannon isn't the worst thing that happens. The little group gets split apart -- and Ichigo finds himself facing an increasingly strong series of opponents, including the enraged Renji Abarai and the battle-hungry Captain Zaraki. Facing defeat and death, Ichigo is forced to call upon an ally he never knew he had -- and face a horrible inner enemy.

When a murder is committed in the Seireitei, the Soul Reapers are thrown into chaos, as they automatically blame the ""ryoka"" intruders for the death of one of their own. Orihime, Chad and Uryu are trying to fight their way in, but it's Ganju and the timid Soul Reaper medic Hanataro who make it to Rukia's cell -- only to reveal a horrifying secret from her past.

If the first season of ""Bleach"" was all about introducing the main characters and the concept of Soul Reapers, then the second season is all about Ichigo and Co. causing as much mayhem as possible in the Soul Society. Well, the Soul Society is not as pleasant and peaceful as Rukia led us to believe -- in fact, it has even more weirdos than Ichigo's hometown.

And while the storytelling is well-balanced, the second season is much more violent -- there's floods of blood, massive near-fatal injuries, and Byakuya Kuchiki's ability to shred opponents from a distance with tiny ""cherry blossom"" pieces of metal. And the storyline takes an unexpected twist halfway through, when a character is apparently murdered and the lieutenants start turning against each other. And since there are hints of a conspiracy involving Rukia, it's pretty obvious that something is rotten in the state of the Soul Society. Just what it is remains to be seen, but it promises to cause even more chaos in the Seireitei.

But not all is doom and blood in the second ""Bleach"" season -- it's still liberally peppered with funny dialogue (""That's a pretty cute name for someone who takes himself so seriously."" ""MY NAME IS NOT CUTE!"") and physical goofery (Yoruichi's true form is revealed to Ichigo). Though our heroes spend a lot of time running around causing mayhem, they also create a lot of humor as well -- such as when Ichigo screams for Ganju, only to realize that he just alerted several off-duty Soul Reapers to his location.

Ichigo has to learn a bunch of new skills in this season, including getting closer to his inner, um, sword. Uryu's chivalrous side gets a workout when Orihime is threatened. And Chad's history is finally revealed in full, such as how this gentle giant became determined never to fight for his own sake, and how he became fast friends with Ichigo.

There are a couple of new characters too: we get to see Renji's miserable youth with Rukia, and why he's hellbent on defeating Ichigo. And our heroes team up with an adorably timid Soul Reaper medic named Hanataro, who serves as tour guide/comic relief for much of the season (""See how full of life and energy and vitality I am?"") as well as the boar-riding Ganju.

While most of the Soul Reapers aren't fleshed out, they are given enough quirks and personality to seem very realistic -- narcissists, child prodigies, bookworms, battle-o-philes, bombshells and little creepy girls with pink hair. Two particular standouts are a laid-back, sake-chugging captain named Shunsui Kyoraku, and Rukia's captain, a sickly hunk named Ukitake.

The second ""Bleach"" season takes our heroes straight into the heart of the Soul Society, and a lot of new trouble as well. Definitely worth checking out -- but expect one heckuva cliffhanger.",1214352000,5,4543,4.864165588615783

story-line. With the plot twists involved this is truly a series worth

Since the show is now on hiatus, (I guess until more episodes are translated by Viz Media) I've decided to start purchasing the DVD box sets on Amazon. I picked up Season 1 about a year ago for $27 and just recently I snagged Season 2 when it finally came down to $27 (now its back up to $53). I picked up Seasons 4 (both parts 1 & 2) for $29 each!!! Once Season 3 comes down in price even more I'll pick these up. So basically I am watching these all the way through from Seasons 1 through 4. This is an incredible series and Tite Kubo's manga style really translates well for the anime medium. The characters are quirky, fun and sometimes complex enough to be enjoyable by adults (even though its targetted to teenage boys). Great plots and in particular this season chronicles Ichigo's journey to the Soul Society, the ghostly world where spirits of dead people go.

I've actually watched through the third season on Youtube, but I started buying the DVDs. I WILL HAVE THEM ALL!!!

I don't go into technical details about the quality of the DVD or the extras. Truth be told, outside of the trailers, I don't watch any DVD extras at all. I like the English dub because I don't want to spend the entire show squinting at subtitles. All I can say is that it's a show that needs to be enjoyed as it is. Don't try to read too much into it. It's an adventure story about young heroes, and it's filled with everything that it entails. Ichigo, Chad, Orihime and Uryu are headed to Soul to rescue Rukia. You know, from the first season I thought it was just going to open with a few episodes to get her back then on to something else. Boy was I wrong!

Season two has them in the afterworld, or Soul Society, trying to find and rescue their friend. The plot isn't as simple as that. The Soul Society's 13 guard squads are determined to stop them. Add to that a mystery and a potential traitor in the squad's midst had me on the edge of my seat. It's a complex storyline and they aren't afraid to delve into the personalities of all the characters --no matter how minor they might be. Leave it to Tite Kubo to lay out a fantastic story!

Parents: If you are opposed to cartoon bloodshed, then you probably should watch this first and see if the level of violence is acceptable to you. This isn't American television --it's not edited for content. The heroes get hurt. They bleed. And yes they fail. I actually prefer it because it's in a sense much more realistic than American cartoons which seem to gloss over that fact. Superman and Batman never bleed on Justice League --You ever notice that?

It's a really good show, and I enjoy it thoroughly. I don't really have anything negative to say about it. It's one of my favorite shows.",1274400000,4,2153,4.308641975308642

3467023,3,B001ASQ9N8,"Bleach: The Entry Season Two box set is a five disc set that contains twenty-one episodes.  The first four discs contain four episodes and bonus features, while the fifth disc contains five episodes and bonus features.

On the first disc, there are four extras.  The first extra is ""Production Art,"" which is nineteen pages of line art of the characters that appear on this disc.  The second feature is ""Manga Preview,"" which includes ads for Bleach and other Shonen Jump manga titles, as well as an ad for Shonen Jump magazine.  The next feature is ""Clean Ending,"" which is a textless version of the first closing theme that appears in this box set.  The final extra on the disc is ""Shonen Jump Home Video,"" which contains previews for Naruto, Hikaru no Go, and One Piece.

The second disc has production art, which is eighteen pages of line art of the characters, locations, and weapons that appear on this disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" and the ""Shonen Jump Home Video"" extras are exactly the same as the features that appear on disc one.  The ""Clean Ending"" on this disc is a textless version of the second ending that appears in this box set.

The production art of disc three is fifteen pages of line art of the characters that appear on this disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" and the ""Shonen Jump Home Video"" extras are exactly the same as the features that appear on disc one.  The ""Clean Ending"" has the same song as the ending that appears on disc two, but the animation is different.

The fourth disc has production art, which is fourteen pages of line art of the characters and weapons that appear on this disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" highlights some different titles than the feature that appeared on the previous three discs.  The ""Shonen Jump Home Video"" feature is exactly that same as what appeared on the previous three discs.  The ""Clean Ending"" has the same song as discs two and three, but the animation is unique.

On the fifth disc, the production art consists of twenty pages of line art of the characters that appear on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" is different from any of the manga previews that appeared on the previous four discs.  There are two different endings in the ""Clean Ending"" feature.  The first is the same song that appeared on discs two through four, but the animation is unique from the previous three discs it appeared on.  The second clean ending is a textless version of the third ending song that appeared in this box set.  The ""Shonen Jump Home Video"" feature on this disc includes previews for Bleach the Movie and Naruto the Movie.  The final feature of this disc is ""Bonus: Behind the Scenes of Bleach.""  This is a roughly twenty-one minute feature of interviews with some of the English dub cast (the voices for Rukia, Renji, Byakuya, and Hanataro are interviewed).  This final feature is definitely the best bonus feature in the whole set.

While I knew to expect the repetition of bonus features on this set after seeing the first season box set, I was still a little disappointed.  Like with the first season set, perhaps Viz Media should have considered putting the extras on only one or two of the discs to minimize the repetition.  And I still wonder why textless versions of the opening aren't included as bonus features in either set.  Even though I'm a little disappointed by the bonus features, I would still recommend this box set to anyone who is a fan of the Bleach anime series.",1257206400,,3433,4.646766169154229
3467034,5,B001ASQ9N8,"Pretty much like my first review, the second season of Bleach was something to look forward to. And I can honestly say that season 2 is an instant favorite of mine. This season shows, for those who have watched or bought the first season, Ichigo and his friends stepping into the spirt realm to save Rukia from execution. Along the way, they encounter the Soul Reaper captains of the Soul Society on their way to save her. Again, each episode I watched got better and better; made it worth putting in the other discs because your need of wanting to know whats going to happen nexts starts kicking in. Introducing the Soul Reaper captains was cool and I already like about 4 of the captains because they pretty much stand for the defintion of ""bad-ass"". I highly recommend this season box set for all anime fans. Bleach is one anime worth watching.",1257033600,2,847,4.578947368421052

3467039,5,B001ASQ9N8,"The episodes contained in this Bleach season were originally aired in English in 2007.  Unfortunately, television stations do not air reruns and for those people who do see all of the Bleach paraphenelia there is no other alternative than investing in this DVD boxsets to see the episodes.

Starting off from the end of Season 1, we find our heroes making their ""Entry"" into the Soul Society (the world of the Soul Reapers, who are entrusted with purifying lost souls or vanquishing evil spirits, known as hollows).  It is actually possible for someone to avoid getting the fairly slow Season 1 of Bleach and just jumping right into the series here at Season 2.  With the amount of backstory containing in many episodes and the nice ""review"" type episode at the beginning of this season people can become fairly acquainted with many aspects of the series.

For the DVD themselves, VIZ Media continues to impress with the amazing designs and red colors of the discs. The boxset is sturdy and the character art on each part of the part of the DVD case that holds the discs looks nice too.  The only bonus included within is a poster of Ichigo, which is different than the one in Season 1 Box Set.

The bonuses on the disc include a ""Behind the Scenes of Bleach"", artwork, clean ending (creditless endings), and lastly, Shonen Home Video preview (the same as the first boxset, which includes Naruto, One Piece, and others), and a manga preview.

And for theme songs, the boxset uses the opening theme (that countinues from the first season), Orange Range ""Asterisk"", and Uverworld's ""D-technoLife"" which showcases several of the Captains and lieutenants in the soul society. The ending them is ""Thank You!!"" by Home Made Kazoku, Younha's ""Hokiboshi"", and lastly Skoop on Somebody's ""Happypeople"".  The feature of the endings is that each of them individually for each episode features different scenes and artwork focusing on different characters.  I find the opening theme to be the more provocative and interesting here.

To sum it up, for those that missed Bleach or want to start watching Bleach, this is potentially the season to get.  There are more storylines introduced here, more background given here, the action takes a huge step forward, and a huge event takes place in the middle of the season that will make you crave for the third season to release immediately (which is already out, Bleach: The Rescue).",1251331200,,2416,4.880195599022005

I've left off a few episodes after that point, and am not too thrilled with the storyline, but I know it's going to get back to what I'm wanting since I kind of cheated and read a quick review of a future episode... so, I'm still hooked... WARNING!!! This is definitely a series that you want to start from the beginning, as there is a lot of explanation and background in season 1 that they do not waste time recapping in season 2, if you can even call them ""seasons."" I'm not a huge anime fan, but I would highly recommend, if you think you might enjoy this type of show, buying the first 3 box sets all at once, because otherwise you'll reach the end of one and go nuts waiting for the next to arrive, like I did, twice.

In fact I have found myself getting as engrossed with the backstories of Renji and Rukia and Momo as I am with the main plot of saving Rukia.

The fight scenes are excellent as epic and well executed as one could hope.  And Ichigo's growth as a warrior and as a person is brilliantly executed, and on their ow would make this series on not to be missed.

But it's the bredth and depth of this world and its immense variety of characters that really make this series particularly great.

Picture and sound quality are excellent.  There's a nice featurette introducing the English voice cast and this really is the best way to buy these.

3467054,4,B001ASQ9N8,"after ichigo and co hone their abilities in the world of the living with the help of urahara and yoruichi, they embark on their mission to save rukia before her execution.

in my point of view, the beginning of the second season begins much like the first season. whereas we are already well acquainted with ichigo and his troupe, we are now introduced to allies and enemies in the soul society each with their own interesting pasts. the only down side is that introductions are sometimes so quick that you sometimes can't remember who a character is (especially if you are unaccustomed to hearing japanese names). these introductions really seem to keep the plot line at a stand still for nearly five episodes until the rescue actually begins.

after about the first four or five episodes, however, we are dropped right into the action. ichigo and co are divided while entering the sereitei and are forced the fight for their lives while the members of the thirteen court guard squads attempt to hunt them down.

in contrast to the first season that has a really even pace, the second season accelerates very quickly by dropping us into the action as each of ichigo's troupe is forced to face off against the soul reapers, and later even the captains of the thirteen court guard squads. the only problem i have with this is that much of the action is balanced by unnecessary dialogue. in at least two instances one fight may stretch over two episodes which leaves you feeling if you had gotten your money's worth. action is also interrupted by semi-relevent or irrelevent back story, such as the explanation of chad's loyalty to ichigo and the karakura superheroes respectively.

as for the tone, despite the greater degree of action, the second season is much like the first. we are given our dose of action, humor and even sentimentality over the course of the season creating a very solid anime.

though the second season seems to really take off after the first few episodes, the uneven pacing can become rather annoying as unnecessary dialogue interrupts action. even so, the content and plot make-up for this small downfall.",1223337600,4,2131,4.811475409836065
3467055,2,B001ASQ9N8,"The plot is actually decent, when they actually make progress on the polot, that is.  Toward the end 50% of any given episode is spent on meaningless repetitive flashbacks, grunts, and repeating the same statements over and over ad infinum.  It is getting to the point where a single attack will require an entire episode, and already the writers are too inept to fit a fight in a single episode.  I am guessing that in future episodes a single grunt will be all the plot progression you get for your time and money.... oh wait, that's intentional.  By taking a single action and dragging it out over several episodes the writers create more DvDs for the rabid fans to purchase.  Brilliant.

The way they did this was via grandual degradation of the plotline.  In season 1 virtually the entire episode was plot and relevant, with almost no unnecessary overlap.  Now they overlap at least 2-3 minutes at every break thereby reducing the amount 'episode' by roughly 5 minutes (20 minute of anime - 5 minute of overlap).  To make matters worse, they are now including incessant flashbacks that are nothing but animation you've aleady watched.  A minor quantity of flashback properly placed can be a good thing, but over and over showing the same footage is simply insulting, especially when it delays any plot progression and restricts the main plot progression to roughly 5-7 minutes in any given episode.

Still, at the moment it is better than Naruto whose plot progression averages 2 minutes max per episode.  But I can see how in the future this will be just another DragonballZ clone.  Hopefully they end it before it gets that far.",1223251200,5,1635,4.775800711743773

All the episodes are well done, the animation is fantastic.  I love all the sword fights, it's just entertaining to watch.

As for the Japanese audio and English subs, I have to criticize all the so-called ""fans"" who just watch fansubs and have no intention of buying this set:

You're not a real fan unless you actually buy something to contribute to the original creator.  If someone downloads a fansub and doesn't buy this DVD, they're only hurting the people who make the show.  Sure, hate on the dub all you want, but if you like the Japanese language so much go take classes and become fluent so you can watch the DVDs without the subs, and to the reviewer who said that the English subs are similar to the English Dub, I'd say you're wrong, it's a WHOLE lot different than the dub, there's dialogue that wasn't even in the English version on the subs.

Yes, they say ""Soul Reapers"" instead of ""Death Gods"", but there is is a lot of dialogue that is not included in the English Dub, but the subs are professional, not those stupid inaccurate, clique-ish fansubs, it's still very good though, if you want to truly support Bleach and keep the DVDs coming, buy the DVD sets, I just did and I love it. But I prefer the dub because I, unlike a lot of these fans, do like shows in English.  The average, non-die-hard person just getting into anime is not going to want to watch it in Japanese, they want to watch it in English, so hence, the REASON for English dubbing in the first place.

On another note, Bleach is not for young children, there's profanity, but not any more than a LOST episode.  There's lots of blood, people get hurt and die in this show, so this is not meant for anyone under at least 12 or 13.  Anyone younger should watch with a parent.
