8385487,1,B00305KF98,"Wretched quality and the films are not even complete.  Max Takes a Bath is missing the entire set-up with the doctor.  I will never buy another Grapevine Video release; I've tried them four times now, and their quality is ALWAYS the lowest of the low.  I would rate this ZERO stars if I could.  Instead of buying this, go for ""Laugh with Max Linder"" which is excellent.",1320624000,8,369,4.462686567164179
