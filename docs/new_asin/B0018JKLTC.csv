3417622,5,B0018JKLTC,"You nailed it.  Those Chen Kuan Tai inspirational speeches are awesome in this film and coming from Chen Kuan Tai, you know it!  My favorite from him is the last one he delivers to Gordon Liu, "" Hung Fei, not only are you skilled at kung fu you have the right humility.  This virtue is much more important than kung fu excellence.  When you've beaten your opponent, you've only beaten him in a physical match, but if you can win that man's heart... well then.  That is the way real kung fu should be, forgive men and forbear! Hung Fei, never forget your humility and kindness.  Awesome english dubbs.  Also that showdown between Liu Chia Liang and Liu Chia Yung is priceless in it's own right!",1221523200,,693,4.4523809523809526

3417627,5,B0018JKLTC,"Challenge of the Masters is my favorite kung-fu film, and in my opinion, one of the best kung-fu films of all time. Yes, I've seen 36th Chamber of Shaolin, and tons of Venom Mob movies which I love, but Challenge of the Masters has a few qualities that make it one of my favorite. First, unlike many Shaw Bros. films where revenge is the key goal of the main character, CotM promotes a different kind of message - more compassion and less aggression. It's heroes like Wong Fei Hung that I tend to look up to. I like characters that try to win the hearts of enemies instead of brutally beating them to death. In the Gordon Liu interview on the Dragon Dynasty release of The 36th Chamber of Shaolin, Liu echoes the same sentiments. Second, the training scenes between Chen Kuan-Tai and Gordon Liu are short but sweet, and often humorous. There are really only two fight scenes in the whole movie, but they are pretty good (not as good as Venom Mob movies though), so for those that are all about the choreography, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. I recommend adding this movie to your collection if you're looking for something other than kung-fu dudes wanting revenge.",1301875200,,1176,4.578199052132701
3417628,5,B0018JKLTC,"this movie is a must have for the gordon liu/hung gar/kung fu flick fanaticos. get it, know about it! peace!",1292544000,,108,4.45
3417629,4,B0018JKLTC,"This is  an awesome film by the Shaw Bros.  Lau Kar Leung almost never disappoints, and this is no exception.  Gordon Liu makes a good turn as Wong Fei hung, and he is trained by Chen Kuan tai (the Master from 3 Evil Masters).  This is one Gordon Liu movie that ends in bloodshed, and its a justified and satisfying ending, to say the least.  Great choreography, too!

Tokyo Shock always releases strong prints from Celestial with as many audio options as they can.  This will not disappoint.",1276905600,,492,4.5227272727272725
3417630,5,B0018JKLTC,"Definitely deserves five stars. Liu Chia-Liang (Lau Kar-Leung)'s second directorial feature is amazing, it's also one of the few films where all three Liu brothers are in it. I would probably rank this as my third favorite Liu Chia-Liang film; right below my all-time fave ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" & ""Heroes of the East.""  Great fu (the weapons used in the film were real) especially the fights between the Liu brothers, and a bunch of cameos. Tokyo Shock did a fabulous job restoring this gem; remastered, widescreen, well done subtitles and your choice of audio (Mandarin, Cantonese & English). The interview with Chen Kuan-Tai was awesome & informative. Although the whole movie is great; for me, the meat of the movie is the teacher/student relationship between Chen Kuan-Tai & Gordon Liu. I've seen plenty of martial arts pictures (just check out my reviews), but I've never seen that teacher/student aspect done with more emotion and heartfelt sincerity; ""More forgiveness, less aggression."" (quote from the subtitled track).",1231891200,6,1036,5.203592814371257
3417631,5,B0018JKLTC,This is an awesome kung fu movie with a classic premise. Gordon Liu is totally amazing as usual. The quality of the movie is really good - its been digitally remastered - awesome picture compared to some kung fu movies.,1223337600,3,219,4.5
3417632,4,B0018JKLTC,"This is one of the best films by Shaw Brothers director Lau Kar Leung (""Executioners From Shaolin""), yet the lack of fights may deter some fans of kung fu flicks.  That is often a criticism of mine on many films too.  Well... not this time.  The characters, story, and overall theme pulled me right in.  I'll admit that it would've been nice to see more fisticuffs, but this is easily good enough to recommend without the constant brawling.

Another chapter in the story of real-life Chinese hero Wong Fei Hung, the subject of many unrelated films by the director, whose own father was taught by a student of Fei Hung's.  This is the first time actor Gordon Liu would portray him, but not the last.  Here, Fei Hung is a mischievous boy, who wants to learn to fight from his father, Master Wong Kay Ying (Kong Yeung).  Master Wong feels that Fei Hung lacks the right temperament to seriously study kung fu.  When he messes up a competition for his father's school, he is sent to learn Hung Gar Kuen from his father's master, Lu Ah Tsai (Chen Kuan Tai, ""Crippled Avengers"", ""The Master"").  Soon after his training begins, Fei Hung learns that his friend (Lau Kar Wing, ""Knockabout"") was murdered trying to apprehend a criminal, played by the film's director.  Master Lu talks him out of going to find his revenge, and into staying, to train.

It should certainly be mentioned that though there are only a couple of fights in this film, they are excellent.  Especially when you consider when this was made.  Fairly fast and full of form.  All alliteration aside, I think this movie is quite an accomplishment.  Other than ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"", this may be Lau Kar Leung's best film.  It should be shown to all students of the martial arts, as a positive example of why fighting should only be used as a last resort, and how compassion can change an enemy's agenda.  EXAMPLE:  As a kid, during an unsupervised basketball game, I assaulted someone who could've ripped me to pieces.  Instead, he restrained me just long enough to let me know that I was being irrational, and that all would be forgiven if I calmed down.  It took me a second to come to my senses, but the problem was resolved, just like that.  He had every right to smash my face in.  I was embarrassed, but he saved me from an even worse humiliation, and a lot of pain.  Not to mention teaching me a valuable lesson I would carry with me for the rest of my life.  Though I rarely see him, we are still friends.

I only wish I had this DVD from Media Blasters.  I have a remastered copy from Red Sun, with fantastic picture quality that lives up to the usual job from Celestial.  What you'll get if you purchase the Media Blasters version is that same great remastered picture, plus interviews with Chen Kuan Tai (who I should mention is terrific, like always), and several language options.  I wouldn't have purchased the bootleg, except that I found it used for $4.  Who can pass that up?  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  4.5/5
