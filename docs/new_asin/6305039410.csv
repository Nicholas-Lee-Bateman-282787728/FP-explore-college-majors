7881614,4,6305039410,"GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY is simply one of the best Documentary Series ever made. Produced between 1992 and 1996, and originally broadcast on BBC2, this fascinating series examines some of the greatest criminal cases in history. Bizarre Deaths, Unsolved Murders, Serial Killers, Legendary Trials, War Criminals, Gangsters, Kidnapping Cases, and more are profiled in these fascinating episodes. Solely making use of archive footage, stills and interviews, GREAT CRIMES AND TRIALS OF THE 20TH CENTURY was produced in an era when ""true crime"" television was dominated by dramatised reconstructions, a genre that became popular in the 1980s. Everything about this series is great: the many different cases covered, the narration, the information given to us, the special ""atmosphere"" created by the music and the voice of the narrator... This is a wonderful series and I highly recommend it to anybody having an interest for True Crime, murder cases and Real life mysteries. Enjoy !

On this VHS you'll find two episodes: John Bodkin Adams & Buck Ruxton. Each episode is 26 minutes long.

Episode 1: John Bodkin Adams
The case of Dr John Bodkin Adams is a contentious one due to the fact that the general practitioner was never actually found guilty of murder or professional negligence. However, years after his own death conflicting views remain about whether Bodkin Adams was guilty of murder or euthanasia. To some he is regarded as a forerunner of the medical mass murderer Dr Harold Shipman, while others believe that he simply carried out mercy killings at a time when painkillers were the only way to alleviate terminal suffering.

Episode 2: Buck Ruxton
Buck Ruxton was a Parsi doctor and murderer, involved in one of the United Kingdom's most publicised murder cases of the 1930s, which gripped the nation at the time. He was hanged at Strangeways prison, Manchester on the morning of 12 May 1936. The case is remembered now for the innovative forensic techniques employed in solving it.",1351036800,,2011,5.1063829787234045
