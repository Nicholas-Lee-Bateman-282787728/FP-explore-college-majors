8191410,2,B000PHW2S6,"Jackie Stevens, Jess Wakefield, Darian Caine, AJ Khan, Lora Renee and Jen Ewen are all very attractive ladies, but I must admit, I got this DVD because of AJ and Darian's appearances. I've seen Lora Renee in a few DVDs, notably the wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erotic-Survivor-2/dp/B000062XEB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erotic Survivor 2</a>, and Jackie Stevens in the comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-Hex/dp/B000O76Q16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex Hex</a>, but I'm not familiar with the other performers' work.

`Softcore Divas' has each performer talking directly to the camera about such subjects as how they got into the adult entertainment business, what their fantasies are, what they look for in a man, what they like and dislike about themselves - the sort of thing you'd ordinarily see in a behind-the-scenes bonus feature. In between these interviews, the girls are paired up for some very tame, very ordinary sex scenes.

Darian, AJ and Lora seemed to exude more confidence about their performances in these scenes (Lora is so carefree that she looks like she's chewing gum in her scene with AJ). Their experience seemed to shine through whereas the others tended to look more hesitant about their work. The opening pairing, Jess Wakefield and Jen Ewen, was rather static and there didn't seem to be much chemistry between them. Once they are both naked, there are some pleasant posed positions, but the scene evolves much too slowly. They are both very attractive: Jess is quite tall with long, crinkly blonde hair. In the interview segments, she displays an engaging personality, all smiles and charming giggles. Jen is a petite brunette, and she talks a good game: ""I've done it in a car going 90mph,"" she says. Moments later she reveals, ""I had a boyfriend who was in the hospital and we did it in the hospital bed. He was recovering from a car accident."" She didn't say whether or not the two events were related.

In Jackie and Lora's scene, one picture dissolve follows another with such frequency that the scene stutters along and ends up just being irritating to look at. However, Jackie sports an engaging look here. Her eyes are heavily made up and her hair is styled so that she looks as though she might have stepped off the set of one of Nick Phillips' grindhouse classics. Call me old-fashioned, but I like that look! Darian has two scenes: one with Jess and one with Jen. She takes control in both, removing her clothes very quickly with Jess, while divesting Jen of hers in a flash. Darian usually puts on a good show and, given the lack of imagination that hinders this production throughout, she manages to up the passion factor here. She really should have been given a scene with AJ, but perhaps the thinking was that we've already seen these two ladies together in other films.

AJ looks stunning just in the interview segments wearing (I think) a low-cut pink number with her long hair covering her breasts. I kept thinking she was topless with such a vast expanse of cleavage displayed, but it was just my imagination. In the interviews, Jen Ewen probably comes out with the most interesting comments. She tells of her passion for visiting swinger clubs and talks of organizing some parties of her own. You'd never think it to look at her; she looks like such a nice girl.

The extras feature seven interminable minutes in the company of a naked Jackie Stevens who has raspberries and raspberry juice dropped on to her. This is intercut with Jackie biting and licking a raspberry. It's all filmed from side-on and doesn't elicit any emotion from the viewer except boredom. There's also a collection of short black and white loops featuring women in striptease situations. The only one of interest was ""Nude Frolics"" with four women playing nakedly in a swimming pool.

Overall, `Softcore Divas' is an opportunity missed. There is no imagination in either the sex scenes or the interviews. These ladies must be so bored with answering the same old questions about their fantasies and sex lives. It's to their credit that they answer so eloquently and with such good humor. As for the sex scenes, could there not have been a threesome thrown in? Could none of the scenes be filmed outdoors? Or in a location different to a room in a house each time? As I mentioned earlier, Darian and AJ should have had a scene together. I also think that some other, more experienced performers, such as Katie Jordon, Allanah Rhodes, Syn Devil, Andrea Davis or Julian Wells should have been drafted in - assuming they are still in the business. My biggest gripe, however, would be for the way the sex scenes were mangled by such poor camera work, editing and direction.

This is a DVD that you should only buy if you're a fan of any of the participants. I certainly would not recommend getting it on a whim.",1186185600,9,4937,5.006090133982948
