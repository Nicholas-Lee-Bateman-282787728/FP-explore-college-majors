7919970,5,B00004CRN8,"Bride of Chaotica is a great episode of Star Trek's Voyager.  It is based on the holodeck program of Tom Paris as Captain Proton.  When subspace photonic aliens find the program, they believe it is real.  Great acting as the Dr plays Teddy Roosevelt, and Captain Janeway gets talked into playing the vampy Queen Arachnia to the arch-evil Dr. Chaotica.  The whole episode is a very funny spoof of the 1920s black & white Flash Gordon series.",1294099200,,440,4.675324675324675
7919971,4,B00004CRN8,"The last half of the second season of ""Star Trek: Voyager"" was stronger than the first half and the series really began to hit find its stride.  Of course, there is still one major development to happen down the road when Kes leaves and Seven of Nine joins the cast, plus the various romantic entanglements that will play out, but there is a gathering of momentum.  Volume 2.9 of this PAL videotape collection offers a nice pair of episodes, the first giving Captain Janeway one of those fun ""Star Trek"" universe problems, and the other giving Tuvok a chance to solve a mystery:

Episode 37, ""Deadlock"" (Written by Written by Brannon Braga, First aired March 18, 1996) is the ""Star Trek: Voyager"" episode where a space anomaly generates a duplicate Voyager (sooner or later in the Star Trek universe there has to be more than one captain). Pursued by Vidiian ships, ""Voyager"" enters a plasma cloud just as Ensign Wildman (Nancy Hower) gives birth to Naomi. But when the ship comes out of the cloud the ship starts falling apart, several crew members are lost when the hull breaches, and Wildman's baby dies. When the bridge is evacuated Captain Janeway thinks she sees herself and when she goes to sickbay she admires Wildman's healthy new baby girl. It is only when ""Voyager"" beams aboard an unconscious woman who looks just like Kes that Janeway begins to suspect what is happening and that there is another ""Voyager."" Meanwhile, the Phage ravaged Vidiians are closing in, eager to make the crews of both ""Voyagers"" part of their organ donor program.

""Deadlock"" is one of the better ""Star Trek"" episodes dealing with doubles, mainly because both Janeways cut through the nonsense and get to the heart of the problem quickly. The episode is more about the search for a solution than it is about catching on to what is happening. The other strength is that it manages to kill off some characters and still have them survive in a way that is both effective and affective. ""Deadlock"" also shows once again that ""Voyager"" had a clear conception of Captain Janeway's character from start to finish with her peculiar but compelling combination of pragmatism and idealism. Does this have something to do with her gender or simply because she was written in a way that would make her clearly different from Kirk, Picard, and Sisko? You decide. This is an episode where the long range impliactions end up being primarily the birth of Naomi Wildman, although it should send Harry Kim to talk to the EMH's psychoanalysis program for a while. An excellent episode that might not be part of the classic canon but definitely a personal favorite (Warp 4.5).

 Episode 38, ""Innocence"" (Teleplay by Lisa Klink, Story by Anthony William, First aired April 8, 1996) is another episode that puts Tuvok in an uncomfortable position. While piloting a shuttle to an uninhabited moon, Tuvok crashes and the ensign with him dies. Suddenly three young children--Tressa (Tiffany Taubman), Elani (Sarah Rayne), and Cori (Tahj D. Mowry)--appear, claiming their ship crashed on this moon as well, killing the adults. Meanwhile, back on ""Voyager,"" Captain Janeway is butting diplomatic head with Alcia (Marnie McPhail), the Prelate of Drayan II. Of course the two plot lines are related, as the children tell Tuvok they are afraid of being killed by a creature called the morrok and they were sent to the moon by the Drayans to die. So when a search party of Drayans shows up, they beg Tuvok to hide them. The Drayans find the ""Voyager"" shuttle and Alcia orders Janeway to get her crewman off of her people's sacred ground.

""Innocence"" is a standard Star Trek mystery in that by the end of the episode all of the plot threads are going come together. There are enough red herrings that I really doubt you are going to predict what the big secret is that all the Drayans are tiptoeing around, but by the same token you are not going to be blown away by it either (especially if you watch the final season of ""Mork & Mindy""). The episode does serve as something of a reminder that Tuvok is a parent and you have to feel a bit sorry for these children who do understand why making emotional appeals to a Vulcan is not a sound persuasive strategy. On balance the episode is engaging enough to keep you interested in find out about the big secret and does not offend your sensibilities enough for you to feel that your intelligence has been insulted.",1147046400,2,4417,4.743489583333333
7919972,4,B00004CRN8,"Volume 2.1 in the ""Star Trek: Voyager"" collection of PAL videotapes does not begin with the premier episode of the show's second season.  That episode, ""The 37's,"" appears on Volume 1.11, but aside from having the ""Voyager"" crew rededicate themselves to getting back home from the Delta Quadrant it was not that good of an episode (if you go with the ""Star Trek: Voyager Collection's Edition"" you can start from the beginning of season two).  In the two episodes here we finally get to find out something about Chakotay's beliefs beyond his omnipresent tribal tattoo, and Harry Kim is granted his biggest wish:

Episode 21, ""Initiations"" (Written by Kenneth Biller, First aired September 4, 1995), finds the ship's First Officer receiving permission from the Captain to borrow a shuttlecraft in order to perform a ritual commemorating the death of his father. But then the ship accidentally ends up in Kazon space and Chakotay becomes the target of Kar (Aron Eisenberg, a.k.a. Nog on ""Star Trek: Deep Space 9""), a Kazon youth who will become a warrior and earn a new name by killing the Starfleet officer. However, it is Chakotay who destroys Kar's ship, beaming the youth aboard at the last moment. Chakotay tries to return Kar to his people, but is captured and learns that Kar will never earn his warrior name because of this disgrace.

However, all of this turns out to be the set up for a series of moral choices which confront both Chakotay and Kar and what makes ""Initiations"" an above average ""Voyager"" episode is that it avoids making the conventional choices each juncture in the narrative. Of course, there is a certain affinity between Chakotay's tribal traditions and the Kazon manhood rituals, at least enough for the First Officer to have empathy for Kar's position. But what makes this episode work is that Kar does not become a convert to Chakotay's way of thinking. Ultimately, there is no meeting of the minds here but at best a tentative and limited understanding. The result is that ""Initiations"" rings truer than other ""Star Trek"" stories like this one that we have seen. This would be because of both Biller's script and the performances of Beltran and Eisenberg (Warp 4).

Episode 22, ""Non Sequiter"" (Written by Brannon Braga, First aired September 25, 1995) is about the person on ""Voyager"" who is most desperate to reach home.  So when Ensign Harry Kim wakes up in San Francisco you would think this would be a good thing. But the strange thing is that his girlfriend Libby (Jennifer Gatti) acts as if he has not been lost in the Delta Quadrant for over a year and neither does his friend Lt. Lasca (Mark Kiely) at the design lab at Starfleet Headquarters. When Kim checks Starfleet records they indicate that ""Voyager"" did indeed disappear in the Badlands and that he was never assigned to the lost ship-and neither was Tom Paris, who is out on parole and now living in Marseilles (What? Everybody knows Paris is in France, right?).

This is another in a long tradition of ""Star Trek"" episodes where a crewmember wakes up and finds everything is completely different. Of course Kim is desperate to believe this is really happening, but his sense of duty keeps intruding. When Kim tracks down Paris and learns that his best friend has no idea who he is, Paris is still interested in the story. But his questioning gets him arrested as a Maquis spy, which leads Kim closer to the truth. The explanation, of course, is rather confusing, but what makes this a decent ""Voyager"" episode is how Paris responds to Kim's insistence that they are friends and the idea that in a quadrant far, far away he is not a worthless disgrace that washed out of Starfleet. The ending of ""Non Sequiter"" plays out along those lines and the episode has some resonance in the series in that it does end up helping Harry Kim get his head straightened a bit regarding how his duty might be more important than his plight (Warp 4.5).",1146355200,,3932,4.748169838945827
