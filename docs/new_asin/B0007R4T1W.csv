2234013,4,B0007R4T1W,"It is rather amazing that having used Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes for dozens of movies over the course of almost the entire century, Hollywood finally went back to ERB's novels to find another property for a film and ignored the John Carter of Mars series and went for ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" a rather second-rate potboiler. But if you forgive the cheap special effects (be kind, it is a 1975 film) this is not a bad adventure story. Burroughs basically wrote his own version of ""The Lost World"" as a German U-Boat sinks a British ship whose crew manages to take over the submarine. Traveling to South America they find a lost continent where there are dinosaurs and cavemen (ergo, ""The Land That Time Forgot""), neither of whom has any respect for civilized human beings.

Doug McClure stars as American adventurer Bowen Tyler in this British production. McClure and director Kevin Connor would make two other similar films based on Burroughs novels, ""At the Earth's Core,"" from the more ambitious Pelucidar series and a sequel to this film ""The People That Time Forgot."" Along for the ride are the beautiful and brainy biologist in distress, Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon), U-Boat Captain Von Schoenvorts (John McEnery) and his cunning second in command Deitz (Anthony Ainley), along with a savy Brit named Bradley (Keith Barron) who manages to be put off by being eaten by the dinosaurs longer than most of his mates. Of course not only do these people have to watch out for dinosaurs and cavemen, they have to watch out for each other. ""The Land That Time Forgot"" is a film that teaches its young British audience that even during World War I when the Germans were not Nazis you still could not trust them.

The story is basic adventure, with Tyler and company facing one peril after another. The script is decent, given the going ons; Michael Morcock worked on the script along with James Cawthorn, so there is an inherent assumption that all of the good stuff belongs to the noted fantasy writer. There is an attempt to get into some of ERB's reasoning for the existence of ""Caprona,"" as the lost continent is called, but it only muddles the film until the action gets going again. The cast takes the situation seriously, which is a prerequisite in any film like this, but while the action is above average the special effects are tacky. The dinosaurs are laughable and the miniatures are not much better. Still, you get an indication of how much fun the action-adventures elements are (for this particular genre and this particular time) when the film still gets 4 stars despite the hokey dinosaurs.

""The People That Time Forgot"" is the 1977 sequel, although in between the two there was the 1976 film ""At the Earth's Core,"" which is mentioned mainly because all three films star Doug McClure, are directed by Kevin Connor, and are based on novels by ERB. Ironically, the tag line for this film makes it sound like the films are a trilogy, although ""At the Earth's Core"" is based on the Pelucidar series, which is quite different. ""The People That Time Forgot"" is definitely the weakest of the three, which is not all that surprising because it is based on the second book of a second rate series of potboilers by ERB. O

.

The basic plot reminds you a lot of ""Return to the Planet of the Apes. Major Ben McBridge (Patrick Wayne) leads an expedition to Antarctica to find his friend, the American adventurer Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), who is marooned on the lost continent, Caprona, a.k.a., the land that time forgot, where there are dinosaurs and cavemen. McBridge has a plane, but it crashes and his little expedition has to survive until they find McClure (where they can break the good news that they are there to rescue him!). McClure had to deal with Germans from a U-Boat but McBridge has to put up with Lady Charlotte Cunningham (Sarah Douglas), who goes from royal pain to damsel in distress pretty quickly once things start happening, Dr. Edwin Norfolk (Thorley Walters), who fortunately knows everything about dinosaurs and cavemen, and Hogan (Shane Rimmer), the faithful side kick who is the obvious first choice to be dinosaur food.

""The People That Time Forgot"" provides the same sort of lousy special effects that plagued ""The Land That Time Forgot,"" but without the non-stop action and adventure that redeemed that first film. Besides, Tyler has ditched Lisa, his paramour from the first film and replaced her with Ajor (Dana Gillespie), a cave woman who probably took the pretty English biologist apart with that big knife. There is no need to watch this sequel out of a sense of completeness to the ""story,"" because you are not going to be happy to the ending. However, pay attention to the Executioner, who is played by David Prowse, who came to this set after having wrapped up a little film called ""Star Wars"" that you might have heard about.  That is the only reason I am rounding up on this DVD, because the first film is a four and the sequel is barely a three.",1109548800,6,5014,4.723428571428571

2234065,5,B0007R4T1W,"I saw this movie in the theaters when I was a kid (10 or 11 years old), with my brother. It was an amazing adventure! For its time, the special effects were extremely good. The actors actually PLAYED their parts to the hilt, despite the probability of a German U-Boat and British prisoners finding a lost continent in the South Atlantic inhabited by prehistoric dinosaurs.

Veteran actor Doug McClure, who starred in a number of these Edgar Rice Burrough novel-based movies, heads the cast, with John McEnery as the German U-Boat captain.

In 1916 a British freighter is sunk in the North Atlantic Ocean by a German U-Boat. Doug McClure, a lady named Lisa, and a number of British sailors are all who survive. They make their way in lifeboats when the sub surfaces to recharge its batteries. McClure's character, Bowen Tyler, is a descendant of submarine pioneers, and he knows the operation of a sub like the back of his hand. With no hope of survival in the open sea, Bowen and the British cohorts board the sub and surprise the German mariners as they come out of the hatch. They take over the sub and force them to steer to neutral territory. Their plan is thwarted by a die-hard German executive officer, who destroys the radio so they cannot make verbal contact with the British. He also tampers with the compass, and leads them on a course to the South Atlantic, where the German captain retakes his sub and threatens to have Bowen Tyler transferred to a German supply ship where he will be shot as a pirate. Lisa, the British lady, helps Bowen Tyler and his British friends escape from their cabins, and once again they retake the sub. They even give the German supply ship a surprise! However, their supplies (food, water, fuel) are low, and they become lost. With little options, Bowen Tyler asks the German captain for help, which he does. As they continue traveling south they find what they believe to be a lost continent named Caprona, after an Italian seaman who stumbled upon it 200 years ago. The crew need food and water, and take a harrowing trip through an underwater cave. When they surface they find a surprise no one could have fathomed.

In the center of the continent is a land full of dinosaurs and cavemen. The territory is lush and green, kept warm by a giant volcano still very active.
The crew ventures ashore in search of food and water, and are attacked by a tribe of cavemen. They capture one, who shows them where a pool of oil is located. The crew plan to refine the oil for fuel so they can return home. But they must survive the elements of living in a hostile land full of dinosaurs. As they hunt in the north they learn that the cavemen resemble many different species of human evolution. They also learn if they are to leave Caprona they must learn the secret to its existence.

This movie is by no way a disappointment. The producers made the submarine according to history, and the story line is very good. Yes, it does not come close to the special effects of today, but one cannot help admire the efforts and work they accomplished in a time where they did not have computer graphics.

The People That Time Forgot is its sequel, starring Patrick Wayne, the son of the great American actor John Wayne. It came out in 1977, and picks up where The Land That Time Forgot left off.

Wayne plays American pilot Ben McBride. He is a childhood friend of Bowen Tyler and is off on an amphibious plane with a female reporter, played by Sarah Douglass, his co-pilot, and a British professor to search for Tyler. Their plane is attacked by a Pterodactyl, and forced to land on Caprona. Leaving the co-pilot behind to make repairs on the plane, McBride and his team march off in search of Tyler. The come across a cave woman who helps them, fight off dinosaurs, and learn of the fate of Bowen Tyler, also played by Doug McClure in a return performance.

I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel, although not as much as its predecessor. Still, I had to watch it because it picked up where the first movie left off. Wayne does a good job as the American pilot, and Douglass too, is fine as a spunky reporter. You will not be disappointed by either of these movies and if you are a fan of these movies from the past you will be glad to see them again and add them to you DVD collection.

2234091,5,B0007R4T1W,"It's a great idea to have these two films under one roof, so to speak, not so great that they are done on double sided DVDs.  (It took two DVD players to get the first movie to play.)  Both movies are fun (but the books are definitely better).  Both have spectacular cinematography by Alan Hume, giving them a consistent look.  The dinosaurs are freakishly made puppets (hand-held and/or worked by strings).  My only complaint with the first film is that it spends far too much time focused on being a war movie that I was afraid they forgot what they went there for.  Hello, fantasy land with dinosaurs, where are they!  The first film deals with enemies joining forces, refining oil to get them out of Caprona.  The second film is a rescue mission to save/retrieve Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) from the first film.  It took them years to mount this search, better late than never.  Both films deal with the denizens of the unknown continent, where the creatures evolve through migration, heading north across Caprona, rather than natural selection.  It's an odd notion, that location-location-location decides how we end up as a species.  In the second film, it's put forth that Caprona is itself a living entity that literally chases them off the continent via volcano.  Gives a whole new meaning to `don't tread on me.'  Both films are quite fun to watch back to back.  I enjoyed them when they were first released back in the late 70s; love them just as much now as nostalgic kitsch.",1408838400,,1486,4.683397683397684

After Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (a 50's masterpiece), I can recommend Land Unknown, Gorgo, Dinosaurus, and Beast of Hollow Mountain.  The first two are monster suits; the last two are stop action photography.  They aren't bad.

2234207,5,B0007R4T1W,"Hello

For whatever it's worth I submit this laconic review of my Amazon purchase of some SCI-FI movies from the 50's and 60's and 70's. Now that I recently semi-retired from WORK I have some time (space-time) to set aside for watching again some of the sci-fi classics on DVD such as King Kong with Fay Wray and The Lost World and The Land that Time Forgot and The Time Machine with Rod Taylor and Time after Time with Roddy Mcdowell, etc.

I enjoy the sci-fi original versions alot more than I do the more current re-makes. For example, I love Journey to the center of the Earth starring Pat Boone but did not enjoy all that much the more current version with Brendan Fraser.

I especially love the fact that this DVD has two classics on it : The Land that Time forgot and The People that Time forgot (for the price of one) - both movies providing Ray Harryhausen-type special effects and Dinosaurs and lots of action and PRETTY WOMEN.

I bought from Amazon as well the following DVD's which are all enjoyable and exciting conceptual movies :  Invaders from Mars, Day of the Triffids, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Mighty Joe Young, When Worlds collide, Sinbad's 7th and golden voyages, Forbidden Planet, World without End, etc.

I really love to transport myself vicariously to these far off places while thinking about Albert Einstein's contributions to the movies through his General theory and Special theories of relativity........

So I give these movies 5 stars and hope that Einstein's cosmological constant was and is not his BIGGEST BLUNDER!!!!!",1350172800,2,1559,4.773234200743494

I guess the filmmakers decided the whole volcano scene added more excitement to the movie.

Anyway, you can't go wrong ordering these old ""B"" classics.  I really don't understand how people can rate these one star.  It seems to me you know what you're getting in an old sci fi.

And the sequels were just hideous! Spielberg likes to repeat himself a lot so he decided to throw in some ""Goonies"" routines for the kids and he ruined it. In many ways, The ""Land That Time Forgot"" and the extra-cheese sequel ""The People That Time Forgot"" were superior to the J.P. series, and if you don't understand why, then you don't understand the art of sci-fi fantasy cinema. My personal favorite in this genre is ""At The Earths Core"", and not just because of Caroline Munro's amazing abdominal region, among other things. ;)",1336003200,,682,4.837606837606837

This low budget fantasy centers around a World War I submarine that is carrying prisoners which stops down at a refinery in Antartica but stumbles upon a world that is still locked in Prehistoric times. The special effects are incredibly bad by today's standards so you have to accept that they're well made puppets and roll with it or you won't enjoy the film at all. Certain elements in the story were uneven or just didn't make sense. There were some mildly interesting touches on evolution and the beliefs of the primitive men.

2234229,4,B0007R4T1W,"When I first saw these titles I assumed they were very low budget second feature films - the type that satisfied kids but really no one else. But that was OK with me. I have many memories of filling Sunday afternoons with just that type of film with my buddies during my pre-teen years.  What a surprised to find these films, while true to the type, are quality-wise a good bit more.

The first thing that struck me was the quality of the set used to emulate a First World War submarine in The Land That Time Forgot.  We are used to seeing WWII subs and if such a set had been used it would have gone unnoticed, at least by me. But the producers cared enough to make the vintage appear correct. And the cinematography captured the confined feel of the place too, much more so than in what I would have expected - a quickly set up, over-lit set.

Same with the dialog and the character development. Again, not what I expected. Better by far!

The story itself however fit the bill perfectly, Classic Edgar Rice Burroughs! Delightful!

Any shortcomings? Well yes. The stop animation was, while not terrible, certainly not up to the standards of Ray Harryhousen or Willis O'Brien. But then again, whose is?

Bottom line: If you too have memories of Sunday afternoons spent in the movie house watching young people's thrillers these will remind you of exactly why. Not high brow. Not ostentatious. Just good, simple, cinematic fun!",1287360000,10,1427,4.594488188976378

2234231,3,B0007R4T1W,"MGM's Midnite Movie series continues with the release of two films back to back,""The Land That Time Forgot""(Aug/75) and ""The People That Time Forgot""(July/77).Even though the latter film is the third of the series it is a direct sequel to the first.""At the Earth's Core""(/76)the second in the series was available at one time but is not anymore.
The Land That Time Forgot,like its' sequels,stars Doug McClure as Bowen Tyler. The film starts with a bottle with a message inside being tossed into the ocean off a cliff. As the opening credits roll it floats onto a distant shore(Scotland,we later learn)and is picked up by a resident there who starts to read the message,which dissolves into the rest of the movie. It seems Tyler was an American passenger on a steam ship which was torpedoed by a German U-Boat(circa 1917).Floating in life boats the remainder of the ships crew with Tyler come upon the U-Boat at the surface. They manage to take over the boat and head for a neutral port. But the Germans sabotage the compass and the sub sails south for hundreds of miles instead of west. The sub changes hands once again into the Germans' and then back again to Tyler and the group. They sail farther until they come upon a mysterious island that the German U-Boat Captain believes is one mentioned but never explored by the  famous explorer Capt. Cook;Caprona.
Low on food and provisions they decide to take the sub through a large cavern which brings them out into the interior of the island. It is a tropical but prehistoric land. During their forays onto the island they have some close encounters with more than a few dinosaurs. They eventually meet the native population and befriend one Ahm,a friendly caveman who becomes their ersatz guide. As time passes they learn there are more than one tribe of humans there,each an advancement on the evolutionary scale,with Ahm's tribe at the bottom. To get home they discover and start to refine crude oil for the sub's engines while Tyler and his girlfriend search the rest of the island. When the island's volcano becomes active the U-Boats sub lieutenant opts to take the sub and get out of there,leaving Tyler behind. However strange gasses from the air quickly incapacitate the crew and Tyler and his girlfriend watch in horror as the sub sinks and blows up before their eyes. The two are left stranded,head north on Caprona and send the message in the bottle that the film opened with.
McClure known more for his television work(The Virginian,Roots,etc)never made a major dent in films,but he does a credible job in this series of B pictures. This film was done by the same English company that did ""Tales From the Crypt"" and others,Amicus productions. Unlike the movie to follow,this film had better production values and the story is far more interesting. The whole German U-Boat part of the plot runs well and keeps your interest. I rate this a solid 3 stars.
The people That Time Forgot again stars Doug McClure as Bowen Tyler but with a much lesser role this time out. The leading man this time around is John Wayne's son David who,like McClure,tried his hand in film work but just didn't have what it took to become a major name. David had an even harder time of it than McClure as his Dad was still very much alive and still casting a big acting shadow from which David could never seem to come out from under. Wayne is Ben McBride who has been persuaded by a professor friend of his of the message from the bottle's authenticity(from the first film) and has under taken this mission to find his old friend. Along for the ride,beside the professor is a camerawomen and his co-pilot. The co-pilot is to help him operate the plane which is stowed on board the ship which is taking them to Caprona. Once there McBride and company head out to find Tyler. At first their plane search is not successful but eventually they find the interior,land and start on their way. They soon run into a fleeing cavewoman who knows Tyler and can speak broken English;taught to her by Tyler. In fact it seems her entire tribe was taught by him but they have been pretty well wiped out by another tribe. It is this other tribe they seek as they are probably holding Tyler hostage. As with the first film the group again encounters more than a few dinosaurs,some harmless but others quite malevolent. Along the way they are confronted by tribesmen riding on horses dressed in Kabooki-like masks. They speak English and say they are there on Tyler's behest to greet them and take them to him. But it is a lie and before you know it all are captured and the two women in the party are now to be offered as sacrifices to the local volcano God. However the men's imprisonment has once good consequence;they find Tyler in an adjacent cell and are reunited. Together they overcome their guards and all escape the tribe and their mountain skull-shaped retreat. However the tribe dogs them all the way and Tyler gets killed before they can reach the plane. McBride and the original party,now with the cave woman, make a shaky and harrowing get away in the plane. They reunite with the ship and sail home.
David Wayne really brings nothing to the acting table here. In fact McClure has a great dying scene in the film in the arms of Wayne;one of the best moments in the film. In fact all the acting is pretty much pedestrian stuff and the plot does nothing to enhance things either. There are many moments where the film is padded with much fleeing footage and not much else which again weakens things considerably. The special effects in regards to the dinosaurs are also cheaper looking this time out. Watch for the wires on the Pterodactyl that brings down the plane at the beginning and watch quickly and you will see human feet under the monster in the cave. I can only give this film 2 1/2 stars at best.
Technically both films here have been transferred pretty well and are shown in their original 1:85:1 widescreen aspect ratio. Other than their respective trailers there are no special features at all. This is of course another DSD,double sided disc,and as always watch out for any scuffs and scratches that either may come with the disc or that YOU may put on the disc inadvertently. I wish they would stop making these things from being made as they are just cheap(i.e.more profits for its' maker)and far too prone to damage.
The Land That Time Forgot is the clear winner amongst these films. These were the perfect Drive-In features of their day and are still good to watch with a beverage of your choice,your favourite main squeeze or family members by your side(great for kids)and a big bowl of popcorn...not necessarily in that order.",1269820800,,6680,4.675446049277825

His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventures were a mainstay of Summer holiday movies in the days before Star Wars: they weren't masterpieces, they didn't boast state-of-the-art special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of kids wanted from a film back in the mid 70s.

The poster for The Land That Time Forgot made it look like this was going to be the greatest film ever made when I was a kid - dinosaurs, U-boats, cavemen, erupting volcanoes and Doug McClure: how could it NOT be great? Well, this being the mid-70s, the crummy special effects in the form of Roger Dickens' prehistoric puppets that don't exactly give Jurassic Park a run for its money. But still, this low-budget adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' terrific adventure novel does have some good ideas in its script as well as dinosaurs, U-boats, cavemen, erupting volcanoes and Doug McClure, so it's not a total wash, and compared to the incredibly poor sequel, The People That Time Forgot, which threw away all that was best about the premise, it's still fun, if somewhat muted. And it has a really great poster.

The People That Time Forgot was barely released, and it's not hard to see why. Filmed on the cheap - this time round there are few dinosaurs, glove puppet or otherwise - it drags on forever to little effect. With McClure reduced to a cameo, the film focuses on the rescue mission led by Patrick Wayne, Sarah Douglas and Thorley Walters but apart from Dana Gillespie's spectacular cleavage and an okay score from John Scott, there's not much to recommend it.

2234300,4,B0007R4T1W,"PLOT:
The Land That Time Forgot (1975): The story begins in June of 1916. World War I is raging on land as well as in the water. A German submarine controlled by Captain Von Schoenvorts (John McEnery) spots a British warship and torpedos it. Two of the survivors are Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) and Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon), civilians. Pretty soon they discover that some of the British officers survived as well, including Captain Bradley (Keith Barron). The survivors watch the submarine come out of the water and devise a plan to hijack it. They row the lifeboats over to the sub and successfully take the German crew hostage. Tyler commands the crew to sail due West to the United States. After 6 days, no land turns up. Tyler discovers that the Germans placed a magnet next to the compass, and that they had really been traveling south for 6 days. This means they are actually near South America. They find an island surrounded on all sides by ice and rock. The only way in is through an underwater cave. Captain Von Schoenvorts believes this to be a legendary island known as ""Caprona"". The two crews realize that on this island, the war means nothing. They decide to put their differences aside, cooperate with each other, and explore the island. Once inside the island, the crews realize that Caprona is a lost world of dinosaurs and cavemen. The biggest question is, ""Will they get out alive?""

The People That Time Forgot (1977): Tyler's message in a bottle is found off of the coast of Scotland at the end of 1917. A year later, an expedition is formed to find Tyler and the island of Caprona. The expedition includes Tyler's boyhood friend Maj. Ben McBride (Patrick Wayne), Lady Charlotte Cunningham (Sarah Douglas), Dr. Edwin Norfolk (Thorley Walters), and pilot Hogan (Shane Rimmer). They take a ship to the island, then fly a plane to get inside it. The plane is attacked by a Pterodactyl and crashes. Hogan stays with the plane to fix it. The other three decide to go off and explore. The explorers see many of the dinosaurs that Tyler described in his letter. They eventually come across a cavegirl named Ajor (Dana Gillespie). Ajor speaks English and tells them that Tyler taught her how to speak it. She also says that Tyler was taken prisoner by a group of mutants. The four travelers then set out to find him, with hopes that he is still alive.

COMMENTS: These two films are based on a trilogy of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan. The storyline is awfully similar to Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Lost World."" Both films were directed by Kevin Connor and featured Doug McClure as Bowen Tyler. The special effects are ridiculous by today's standards, but the stories are pretty cool. Look out for a cameo appearance of David Prowse (Darth Vader himself) as the executioner in the second film. These films are great for anyone interested in dinosaur or adventure films. Kevin Connor also directed another Burroughs adaptation called ""At The Earth's Core"" (1976), the first story of the Pelucidar series. It was released between the other two films and also featured Doug McClure in the starring role. Many people mistake this film for being another sequel, but it is unrelated to the other two films.",1139184000,81,3242,4.756660746003552
2234301,3,B0007R4T1W,"Overall, ""The Land that Time Forgot"" is a decent fantasy/adventure fare with interesting characters and a good story but unfortunately I have a couple of problems with it.
It seemed that the German and English sailors couldn't wait to start shooting at everything that moved whether it be dinosaur or CroMagnon.
Its one thing with the pleisosaur started munching on crew members and attacking the submarine, but later on what exactly where the two T-Rex's doing that warranted their slaughter? McClure and crew didn't seem to be too concerned about escaping and the T-Rex's weren't even attacking them, but what do they do? Shoot first and ask questions later apparently.
The same is true when the poor triceratops just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when the trigger-happy U-boat crew started blasting away for absolutely no reason. It looked like all the triceratops were doing was protecting their egg nest, but nooooooo....blast 'em!!! The sad tear rolling down the snout of the dead triceratops was a fitting metaphor for the impulsive violence of McClure's crew.
But the biggest indignity of the film is the tragic figure of the friendly CroMagnon Ahm who tries to befriend McClure and crew, tries to warn them of the ""evil"" CroMagnons found further up the valley but nooooooooooooo, he ends up getting a la carted away by a pterodactyl while McClure and friends do nothing to help him out. Apparently they must have been out of ammunition from all their other ""battles"" rather than help out the one native that befriended them.
Regardless, the film is fun to watch and shouldn't be taken at as serious as I have (tongue in cheek) written above.",1134691200,8,1672,4.890845070422535
2234302,5,B0007R4T1W,"i watched these films as a kid and loved them. sure they are a little dated in the fx but these movies both have a heart and do just what a movie should do,make you enjoy them as you watch them. no they don't have a deep message,but sometimes you just need to sit back pop some popcorn and get lost in ""the land that time forgot"" go on and enjoy!!!!!!",1134086400,29,351,3.9577464788732395
2234303,4,B0007R4T1W,"This is a great double-feature Drive-In fair.  The monsters are hokey, but this is still great family type fun.  They were done on a shoestring so what do you expect?  Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs novel The Land People Forgot has sort of a Lost World premise.  Americans and Brits are travelling to South America when they are torpedoed by a German U-Boat.  Later the survivors manage to catch up and overtake the submarine.  They end up finding a lost continent, before you can say ""Is Barney Purple"" there are monsters trying to make lunch out of our explorers.  Instead, they make Barney Burgers.  Then they find T-Tex, cavemen and all sorts of adventures.  However, Doug McClure (Travis of The Virginian) and Susan Penhaligon are left behind in the final brouhaha, which leaves the opening for the second movie.  The People Time Forgot.

Patrick Wayne and Sarah Douglas star in the second film.  It has the feel of the second Planet of the Apes where they come to find what happened to Chuck-baby.  This time Wayne and Douglas are flying into the island to see if they can find McClure and Penhaligon.  There is more monster chompings, a sexy gal in a One Million Years B.C. costume that says she knows McClure and can lead them to him.  It's a race of time to keep away from the bad guys and find McClure before the whole bloody isle goes BOOM!

So pop the popcorn, turn out the lights and pretend you are at a Drive-In.  They play better!",1129766400,29,1445,4.538759689922481
2234304,4,B0007R4T1W,"Land That Time Forgot is a pretty cool movie.  Sure, it may seem silly these days when everyone has seen Jurassic Park and a bunch of other CGI creatures in various flicks(not that CGI looks very real either, it's just better at showing fluid movement).  So, yes, the puppet dinosaurs in this film will probably get a few chuckles from you.  That's all part of the fun though.  The story is pretty cool.  The whole idea of a hidden island stuck in prehistoric times is an interesting one.  The story takes place during WWI, where fueding British and German naval officers have to band together to survive and get off the island, which looks to be somewhere in the arctic.  And what better man to have with you on an island of dinosaurs and hostile neanderthals than Doug McClure?  Highly recommended and fun.  Midnite Movie indeed!  The People That Time Forgot follows a rescue mission to find Doug McClure(he had put a message in a bottle and thrown it into the sea where it conveniently ended up on British shores and into the hands of McClure's buddy).  This search party consists of Patrick Wayne taking over hero duties(he's no McClure, that's for sure), an English professor(with cane), B movie queen Sarah Douglas(with the worst Princess Leia hairdo you've ever seen) and a supersexy cavewoman who's too hot and well groomed to be believable as a neanderthal.  Basically this is all thrown together as an excuse to rehash the events of the first film.  McClure's character has apparently taught the entire island how to speak english, including the villans!  So now we don't have to bother with subtitles.  The evil tribe of humans seems way more evolved than any kind of cro-magnon society.  They wear armor, use swords and ride horses.  They look like the Juns from the Beastmaster crossed with samurais.  McClure gets his cameo when our heroes reach the Mountain Of Skulls(scary) and find him prisoner.  They stage a jailbreak that would make Thin Lizzy proud and try to escape before the volcano erupts and destroys everything(again).  More fun with rubber dinosaurs and miniatures.  Well worth your time if you like your movies a little bad.  See it before they remake it.",1124236800,4,2184,4.798927613941019

8050642,4,B0007R4T1W,"Adapted from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, ""The Land That Time Forgot"" and its sequel, ""The People That Time Forgot"" are, by today's standards, dinosaurs. Relics of a time long gone, the films notably use miniatures to create their set-pieces and puppets to bring the prehistoric creatures to life. Sure, it all looks downright crude but in comparison to the overblown CGI of today's blockbusters, it is not entirely without its charms. Compiled in a bare-bones set under the MGM ""Midnite Movies"" banner, these twin films admittedly have limited appeal, but will definitely satisfy those craving an old-school creature feature (or two).

First up: ""The Land That Time Forgot."" The film is admittedly a little sluggish; as a matter of fact, it takes a third of the film before our crew reaches the land of the lost. A convenient framing device, and what must be the longest message ever stuffed into a bottle, washes up on the shores of Scotland. The message tells the tale of a crew of soldiers and civilians who stumble upon an exotic lost world where the water is warm and crude oil flows freely. Oh yeah, there's also dinosaurs. Big, mean and undeniably tasty dinosaurs! Doug McClure leads the group as they stumble through the jungle and teach their ways of life to a Cro-Magnon tag-along. There's also a female scientist (Susan Penhaligon) aboard who does little more than what the men tell her to do. The film also features one of the most awkward and hilarious Pterodactyls ever committed to film.

Next, ""The People That Time Forgot."" Having finally finished reading the novel in a bottle, a rescue crew is sent to Not-Skull Island in search of survivors. Turns out the dinosaurs are of little threat this time around, and take a backseat to the rapidly developing natives. The buxom and beautiful Ajor (Dana Gillespie) steals the show and stirs confusion in viewers. The film is also host to more humor than the first, namely with the character who is tasked to watch after the plane and guard it from Pterodactyls. The plot goes a little off the rails, but no matter. The film is equally as entertaining as its predecessor. Doug McClure shows up once more, but only briefly.

There's a respectable amount of consistency between the two films, which no doubt results from both being directed by Kevin Connor (who also directed one of the best bad '80s horror movies ever made, ""Motel Hell""). For lazy Saturday afternoon entertainment, you could do much worse. If the idea of watching latex monsters lumber around while goofy humans ham it up appeals to you, this double-feature is just for you.",1488585600,,2608,4.829977628635347
8050643,4,B0007R4T1W,"THE LAND THAT TIME FORGOT

Released in 1974 and directed by Kevin Connor, The Land that Time Forgot is an adventure flick based on Edgar Rice Burroughs book: A German sub during WWI sinks a British ship, but some survivors commandeer the U-boat whereupon there are tensions amidst the two factions. After taking a wrong turn, the sub comes to an unknown land, which they discover is Caprona, a land where dinosaurs and primitive people dwell. Can they ever get back to civilization?

John McEnery plays Captain Von Schoenvorts while the English girl, Lisa, is played by cutie Susan Penhaligon, a biologist. The two have an interesting discussion over the German conduct in the Great War. Lisa observes that Von Schoenvorts is a sophisticated, respectable man, which sparks her to inquire of his brutal war actions.  The Captains Germanic contention is that Lisa is naive considering that ""life is founded upon killing and destruction"" and ""the sea is teeming with living things that prey upon one another to survive."" Say what you will about the dinosaur puppets, but this is some pretty heavy stuff for an adventure flick appealing mostly to youths. The Captains second in command, Dietz (Anthony Ainley), more fits the stereotype that Lisa projects on Von Schoenvorts. Actually, the Captain is the wise father figure.

The British are portrayed in a diplomatic, pragmatic manner (Keith Barron, amongst others). But its the American, Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure), whos the brash, masculine hero. Hes essentially boorish but Lisa cant help but be attracted to him even while she has more mental affinity with Von Schoenvorts, the suave, but maybe-too-old sophisticate.

This was a British production and the dubious dinosaur effects are noticeably inferior to Hammers stop-motion effects used in 1966s One Million Years BC. But if you can embrace their quaintness or ignore their cheesiness, The Land that Time Forgot is a surprisingly decent adventure, almost in the same league as 1954s 20,000 Leagues under the Sea, at least as far as ship-going adventure and worthy mindfood go; plus it lacks the hokey Disney-isms of that movie.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot at Canary Islands and Scotland with studio work done in England.

GRADE: B-/B (6.5/10)

=========================

THE PEOPLE THAT TIME FORGOT

The People that Time Forgot"" is the inferior 1977 sequel to ""The Land That Time Forgot"" from 1975. The basic plot is essentially identical to ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes,"" albeit far less serious.

An expedition (including Patrick Wayne and Sarah Douglas) goes to the savage antarctic hidden land of Caprona to find Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure). There they run into fairly cheesy prehistoric creatures and a ravishing cavewoman named Ajor (Dana Gillespie). She leads them to the Mountain of the Skull wherein Tyler is held captive by a hostile neanderthal-like tribe dressed in cool samurai apparel.

The Spanish locations are outstanding, as are the costumes and many of the life-size sets and opticals. The story moves along pretty quickly (the flick's only 90 minutes long). Patrick Wayne and Doug McClure are Great and Dana Gillespie is awe-inspiring in her skimpy cavegirl outfit, in fact, in my opinion Dana blows the more popular Raquel Welch in ""One Million Years BC"" out of the water (Raquel is a bit too thin to my tastes; Dana has far better curves).

Unfortunately, the story is less serious than ""The Land That Time Forgot"" (i.e. campier) and not nearly as compelling; so don't expect to be enraptured by the story. The miniature sets are too-obviously unreal and the creature F/X are only mediocre-to-poor (for the time period).

FINAL ANALYSIS: If you're into these types of Edgar Rice Burroughs adventures, ""People"" is worth having in your video library. It's nothing exceptional or captivating, but it's certainly fun, light and brisk. And catching the voluptuous Dana Gillespie at the height of her physical beauty is a must. Lastly, it's far better than the awful ""At the Earth's Core,"" which also stars McClure.

The film was shot in the Canary Islands with studio work done at Pinewood Studios, England.
