574491,5,6303153305,"Number one all time favorite movie! I never tire of this classic story with a great plot twist. The genre is magical realism which makes a mundane event magical. Not appropriate for a high school class but definitely a college Spanish class. Please review before showing the students the movie because this is my opinion. I am some what liberal. There is nudity of male and female. The movie cover says  erotic and delectable . Even so,the plot is fabulous and scenery is sublime. Dont miss this movie!",1511136000,2,502,4.704545454545454

574759,5,6303153305,"This foreign film provides a convoluted plot that's quite engaging.  Such films have a tendency to take this author back to his studies of film and foreign language at the same time at a major university in the 1960s where the number of films playing with subtitles was vast and set a very big change from the common fair at the local theaters.  American audiences tend to shun ""sub titles,"" but films of this genre provide opportunities for learning since often what is said is not what the sub titles relate.  That concept was once again born out by this film, originally recorded in Spanish.  One need not really speak the language to perceive the subtleties of word play and this author enjoys the  euphonic intrigues as a major part of the film.  This film is full of intrigues of all sorts.

The main character, Tita the youngest of three siblings, is a battered girl living on a ranch owed by a well-to-do family in Mexico.  Filming was done in the state of Coahuila, Piedras Negras depicting the year 1895 forward for about forty years.  During that time Tita grows up to rebel as do her sisters most notably Gertrudias who fought in the war of Independence.  The recurring themes were rebellion while continuing to be female in every way.

A lot of time in the film is spent on feelings about being a woman whether with or without guilt.  The main character has to overcome guilt and manages to do so very well.  That  realization comes about in argumentative vignettes with her deceased mother's apparition.  Overcoming  required female servitude becomes Tita's goal and she greatly succeeds in passing the freedom of self respect on to her niece Esperanza.  Tita did not get to marry the person of her choice whereas her niece achieved that reality with her aunt's help and support.

Tita's cooking, learned from a senior servant, is intertwined throughout the entire plot in a very quaint and interesting way.  Women of those times were cooks and mothers and not much more.  Even so, they held families together, made wonderful homes and made life tolerable for everyone with whom they came into contact.  A person's life, no matter how simple, is something of great value.

In the end, everyone has a limited amount of time on Earth.  Children are born, people pass on and the past fades away.  Such is life.  This is a film to revisit. It leaves a wonderful feeling of love and peace.",1472428800,4,2398,4.679425837320574

574823,4,6303153305,"A strange fantastical tale of lost love, an evil mother, a wicked selfish sister and consequences thereof. Of how emotions can effect the preparations and the effects of food on the psyche. Crazy at times and never dull. BUT....this movie has been edited form it's original version which I was lucky to see on Netflix years ago. The matches thing was the doctor's Kikapo Indian grandmother's lesson to Tita, who comes to Tita in ghost form when Tita is recovering from the catatonic state she was in. The whole end of the movie is what Tita remembered being told from the ghost. The ghost makes a brief appearance when Pedro gets burned and they use the bark remedy. Why they edited this part of the storyline out is beyond me. But the rest of the movie plot is untouched. Still though the original version is better. Just sayin",1470787200,8,828,4.601351351351352
574824,5,6303153305,"I cannot begin to express how much I love this movie.  It is one of those movies that I can watch again and again, especially if I am introducing someone to the movie who has not yet seen it.

I first saw this movie when it came out in the theatres, with a dear friend whose family is from Mexico.  After the movie he told me ""This is just like the stories that my abuela (grandmother) used to tell me.""  That was high praise indeed.

There is truly something for everyone in this movie - and every man I know who has seen it has enjoyed and appreciated it just as much as every woman - so, even though it's based on a grand, undying passion and romance, it is not by any means a ""chick flick"".

In fact, I consider it a perfect date movie.

The movie is in Spanish, and subtitled, but even if you don't know any Spanish at all, the subtitles are more than sufficient, and I, at least, found that I barely even noticed that I was reading the subtitles in order to follow along.  By the second viewing, I barely even needed the subtitles.

Seriously, this is a fantastic movie!",1470096000,4,1076,4.184466019417476

574826,2,6303153305,"I watched this movie for the first time while recuperating from foot surgery.  I have not read the book, and my first problem with the movie was that the title never made sense. Some reviewers stated that there were many scenes from the original - perhaps the scene that clarifies the title is in a missing scene?  I am fine with subtitles, but I could not understand the English dialogue popping in sporadically.  The only time it was explained was with Dr. Brown's aunt.  I'm also OK with fantasy, but I couldn't determine if the pink roses that turned to red roses was a continuity problem or a fantasy element.

I really wanted to like this movie, but it left me wondering if I had taken too much pain medication!",1468713600,,717,4.484615384615385

575299,3,6303153305,"""Like Water for Chocolate""(1992) was directed by Alfonso Arau. The film is about a Mexican family with a dominant mother who prohibits her youngest daughter from marrying her lover, but through the making of food the daughter continues to express her love for her lover. This magic realist story is full of humour and sorrow as the daughter seeks to find happiness in the world with an oppressive mother.

The blu-ray looks fine though was evidently filmed with a lower resolution than one might expect as the images appear a bit grainy. The film also did seem a bit choppy at times and this was likely because this blu-ray is only 105 minutes long while the original film was 123 minutes long. For some reason it was decided that by shortening the film for the blu-ray/dvd release that this would make the film more palatable for audiences. If not for this I would have given the blu-ray a higher rating. The only special features is an audio commentary by the director and some of the actors.",1432080000,,994,4.6477272727272725

575418,5,6303153305,"Even though filmed in Spanish language (with English subtitles), this is an excellent 1992 movie adapted from the novel of the same title (Como Agua para Chocolate, in Spanish) by a first time Mexican novelist woman. She also wrote the screenplay.
  There are very few flaws in it (perhaps a little slower speech and more emotion depicted by the main character's mother; and a few longer camera 'holds' in places to capture emotions and reactions) to otherwise compete with the best. Definitely talent involved here, with the acting for the most part excellent.
  The plot? NOT as I expected, but better. Because at first I thought it would be one long affair between a young man and the young woman he couldn't marry ... when he married her sister instead and resultantly lived in the large house on the ranch in Mexico with the scorned young woman.
  Close and tempting quarters, anyone would say ...

Lots of  'voice over explanations' by the main character while the action was transpiring, in lieu of less of that and more revelation through direct action and dialogue. Much of this isn't good, but it seems to work okay here, without debasing the quality of the movie much.

Throughout it keeps you glued to your seat, even while reading the English subtitles. Enough time is usually allowed to read them without pausing and backing up on the film to read them again.

Yes, it's a drama, with a lot of meat in it. And well worth your time moreso than most movies.

It now amazes me how good, incidentally, many foreign films are becoming. I think foreign film makers are finally beginning to catch on to the usually better writing and filming techniques of high-profile American Hollywood films. Kudos to them!",1428019200,,1716,4.763513513513513

LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE: Tita (Cavazos) was born on the kitchen tableliterally. Fed and tutored by the family cook, Tita grows up in the kitchen, learning the secrets of food and mastering the culinary arts. At 20, she feels the first stirrings of love. But as the youngest of three daughters, she is tradition-bound to serve her mother Elena (Torme) until her death, and her stern mother quickly dashes any hopes she has of marrying her paramour Pedro.

Pedro (Leonardi) resolves to marry Titas sister, if thats the only way he can be near his beloved. When Titas tears fall into the batter for the engagement party cake, it has a strange effect on the pastry and a devastating effect on the party: Every guest who consumes the cake is overtaken with weeping melancholy over lost loves. Slowly, Tita begins to realize and develop her kitchen alchemy, projecting her deepest feelings into food and transforming the lives of everyone near herfor better or for worse.

Discussion: Thus begins this multi-generational family saga of strong-willed women frustrated by love; of sisters at war and at peace; of fate teasing people with hope and quashing their hopeful plans; of tragedy and joy and love that transcends death; of birth and life and death and the twin threads that tie them all together: food and love. The movie is suffused with a gorgeous saffron glow, as if filmed through a filter of pure honey, and the passionsuch as lust that can literally ignite firesreaches right off the screen.

The travails of the lovers are many, longlasting and heartrending. But above all the film is a celebration of food for the soul: food as a metaphor for passion, sublimation, redemption and salvation. The movies kitchen bruja, reveling in romance, even reveals the secret ingredient in any recipe, whether its a dish, a meal, a marriage or an entire life: Make them all con mucho amor. After viewing this movie, you might never look at food (or bareback riding) the same way again. Salute!",1422576000,,2243,4.758354755784062

(Someone involved with the production, told me that... I'm not making this up!

Let's make a campaign for Lionsgate to release at last the COMPLETE 140+ minute version of this film... It's been years since it's been available here in Mexico an it has NEVER been available in the US!

The tradition itself is stupid enough, but the fact that the daughter just meekly accepts such capricious and despicable treatment, when there's a houseful of servants to cater to the mother's every whim, makes the condition even more absurd and the spineless daughter totally unsympathetic. Who cares what happens to a person with so little self-respect?

Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but I am unable to force myself to swallow such a preposterous contrivance just to make this silly story work.",1400544000,2,758,5.154471544715447

For instance, Mama' Elena died because she stopped eating the food that Tita was preparing for her after she was injured, not killed, durig the attack to the farm.

I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie because it makes it that much more enjoyable.  The movie is actually in Spanish but there are subtitles. I really enjoyed the movie and the story is so well told. This is a hard movie to describe but it is a sweet story that does not take itself too seriously and  did a great job of keeping you smiling and entranced.

However, strangely enough, the credits are all in English!  Why not keep the Spanish version completely intact?  The credits also refer to a special documentary made for this DVD, but if there is a documentary here, I can't find it.  I had also hoped, upon seeing a longer running time than on other available copies, that the parts of the movie Buena Vista edited out would be restored, but they don't seem to be.

I can't fault the film itself for these few small peculiarities.  ""Como Agua Para Chocolate"" is a masterpiece, and the plot is clear enough to follow even if you don't speak Spanish.  Lumi Cavazos' performance shines--it is impossible to look away when she is onscreen.  Every aspect of the movie is delicious.  If you purchase this particular DVD, revel in the music, the scenery, the cinematography, acting, and, above all, the exquisite tapestry that Laura Esquivel created, both in her novel and in her screenplay.  If you love the book, the movie will not disappoint--her story comes vividly to life, a rare thing to see in a world where cinema and the literature that inspires it appear to come from two different worlds.",1390176000,,1284,4.790909090909091

576332,5,6303153305,"This has been one of my favorite movies/stories since its release in the 90s -- I even have the VHS version. It's considered to be a part of the magical realism realm of literature and art.  So you have to be willing to suspend disbelief and accept it as it is presented.  It tells the story about a family of women in Mexico in the late 1800s early 1900s.  The story spans generations within the family and examines the relationships, traditions, secrets and lives of the women.  It is a very female-centered story with extremely strong female characters all around.  In its simplest most boiled down version, it's a love story.  But it's so much more than that.  There aren't a lot of films with strong female characters but it's definitely rare to have the cast and plot dominated and carried by multiple strong female characters.  This film is chock full of strong women doing things that society says women should not do.  It's ironic because on the surface, the film is about a woman mooning over a man, and women cooking -- the most traditional roles for a woman ever.  The story is extremely new and interesting, it's beautifully told, and visually gorgeous.  If nothing else, the film will make you extremely hungry.

A depiction of food as the love emanating from one's soul as auspicious to evoking love in the relationships most dear to us and for which are necessary for thriving and survival.  It is a must see for anyone who knows what it feels like to place your love into the food you prepare and and to serve it to those you love.

literally translated from the phrase como agua para chocolate, which is a common expression in Mexico and was the inspiration for Laura Esquivel's novel title. In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, hot chocolate can be made with water instead of milk. Water is boiled and chunks of milk chocolate are dropped in to melt thus creating the hot chocolate. However, the saying also refers to describing a state of passion or - sometimes - sexual arousal or, more popularly, ""boiling mad"" in anger.[4] The phrase is also commonly used to mean something is ""perfect"" for something else.",1381104000,,686,4.863247863247863

One example:  the sister who became a General in the Revolution tells her sister (dubbed), ""The Revolution would be more fun if you were there to cook for me every day.""

MOVIE REVIEWS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GIVE AWAY THE WHOLE MOVIE.  WHY DO SO MANY PEOPLE ON AMAZON

recommend it, as I know it has substantial cuts from the original.  I haven't been able
to find any more complete versions on video.

That said, I still found this a warm, funny, bittersweet, moving fable about three
sisters, their horrific mother and their lives and loves in early 20th century Mexico.

Feels epic in scope, despite only being 1:45 long.  That does mean a few things get rushed,
and there are moments that edge into too cute.  Perhaps that is the effect of the above mentioned
cuts.

But for the most part, this mix of romance, cooking, melodrama, gentle satire
and magical realism works wonderfully well, and the constant use of food as a
metaphor for sex, and for life feels original and creative.",1344729600,,806,4.673758865248227

577082,1,6303153305,"This was unbelievably awful.  It focuses heavily on metaphor, and I'm ok with metaphors--but I resent being expected to take them literally.  The ""heat"" of her sister's sexual arousal in the shower physically burned down the shower?  Is this some kind of joke?  Eating matches causes her bed to catch fire?  Are you %$#@ing kidding me?  The movie is full of these overblown metaphors, which would be funny as jokes or passing comments, but shown as physical happenings in a movie, they're just absurd.

Add in the two-dimensional characters (which would be most of them) and the unrelenting cruelty of the heartless mother, which everyone reacts to with ""Oh, that's so sad, but I guess we just can't do anything about it"", and you come away thinking the moral of the story must be that it's ok to be an enabler for someone who treats you and your loved ones like dirt.

I understand this is part of a genre called magical realism.  It seems to me that as with Socialist Realism, if you have to add the word ""realism"" to try to convince people there's anything realistic about what you're portraying, you've already failed on that point.

I felt intellectually insulted and emotionally abused by this movie.  If you'd like a great story about food, chocolate, family, and sensuality, skip this one and watch ""Chocolat"" instead--now that one gets it right.",1343347200,9,1354,4.793103448275862
577083,5,6303153305,"As a Latina, I love when I find rare films which showcase my cultural roots.  The film reminds me of a great book, Rain of Gold.  I love the folklore, the culture, the tradition (harsh, but to true to form), and the passion of the film.  Be prepared for subtitles and for some full frontal nudity (male and female) if you will be watching with young adults. . . a little embarressing for my 14 year old.  (My fault, parents, make sure to check for these things FIRST, before inviting the young ones in to watch.  I was so excited to FINALLY see this film, that I negelected to check any warnings.

Overall, a very entertaining film.  It's worth watching again and again.

577084,5,6303153305,The movie was very interesting and showed how old traditions could be cruel. The way that ingredientes were added to foods and their affects described so sensual was very entertaining. The difficulties this couple went through for the love that they had for each other was interesting and funny at times.  The climax was totally unexpected and very nice.  This movie is very romantic.  I recommend highly it.,1333929600,,408,4.970588235294118
577085,5,6303153305,"I saw this in 1992 but have no recollection of it now. So I got the truncated version after reading the reviews.

It's still an excellent film despite the cuts. This Mama Elena is a selfish, self centred woman to ruin three lives. Knowing her daughter Tita is in love with Pedro, she forbids Tita from marrying. Mama Elena insists on the tradition of the youngest girl is to look after her mother for life.

Mama then proposes Pedro marry her other daughter Rosaura. He does it to get close to Tita. What follows is that Rosaura tries to make a sham marriage work while Tita and Pedro have to sneak around for some stolen moments.

Like Water For Chocolate utilizes food as a metaphor for love and sex very well. Tita's feelings are conveyed through her cooking. The wedding cake she's bakes for her sister is filled with bitter tears. So all those who ate it longed for the love they can never have and ended up puking it all out.

There's also a very sensual scene involving quail in rose petal sauce. I'm very tempted to try out the recipe myself. Tita's sister Gertrudis felt so aroused after consuming the dish that she ignited the bathroom, ran out naked and was scooped up but her future husband on horseback.

As Tita and Pedro reach middle age, Rosaura dies and her daughter gets married. Now, the pair are free to be together. The ending is so sad and beautiful that you really have to watch it for yourself. What I can give away is that the pair is consumed by the flames of passion, literally.

577212,4,6303153305,"Note: Although I've only seen this DVD release, and quite enjoyed it, I also hesitate to fully recommend it, as I know it has substantial cuts from the original 123 minute film released in Mexico (there was also supposedly a 144 minute version, but that may have only been shown at a couple of film festivals, before being voluntarily trimmed by the director).  It's been hard trying to get all the facts as there are a lot of contradictory stories about the film and its history. But in any case, I haven't been able to find any more complete versions on video than this 105 minute version cut down by Miramax.

All that said, whatever is missing, I still found this a warm, funny, bittersweet, moving fable about three sisters, their horrific mother and their lives and loves in early 20th century Mexico.

And the film does feel epic in scope, despite only being 1:45 long. Of course, at that length a few things get rushed, and there are moments that edge into too cute, too neat. Very possibly that is the effect of the above mentioned cuts.

But for the most part, this mix of romance, cooking, melodrama, gentle satire and magical realism works wonderfully well, and the constant use of food as a metaphor for sex, and for life feels original and creative.

Since its very possible none of us will ever get to see the 'full' version, you might as well allow yourself the tasty pleasures of the current DVD and blu-ray.",1300579200,5,1425,4.572549019607843

577307,5,6303153305,"Like water for Chocolate (Como Agua Para Chocolate), released in 1992 is based on a novel published in 1989 by Laura Esquivel. This is a good portrayal of why certain traditions should die. The film consists of a Mexican family of Dona Elena and her three daughters: Gertrudis, Rosaura, and Tita. TIta, being the youngest, is to stay home with her mother until her passing. ""Never, for generations has anyone in our family ever questioned this tradition!"" Dona Elena states.  Day in and day out Tita is obligated to daily chores like the housekeepers Chencha and the Nacha. She spent much of her childhood in the kitchen and is the best daughter  at cooking. The older housekeeper, Nacha, has been way more of a mother to Tita since day one. Tita confides in Nacha greatly. Pedro had confessed his love for Tita during a party. Pedro tells Tita, ""One doesn't think about love. Either one feels it or one doesn't"". He asks for Tita's hand in marriage, but Dona Elena refuses the proposal, but offers Rosaura as replacement.  Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura to be closer to Tita. Pedro disappointed me with this decision. He was not in love with Rosaura. There was no fooling anyone with his new marriage proposition. My solution for Pedro: impregnate Tita. That way she would have been forced to marry Pedro to save what would be left of her reputation, unless the ancient tradition still presides over that.  It seems like there aren't enough Pedros to go around in the neighborhood. Where are the other eligible young men? Throw one in Rosaura's direction.  I find it odd that Rosaura accepts Pedro's hand for marriage when she knows he loves Tita. I dislike Rosaura for her pushiness in having sex with Pedro when clearly he had been avoiding it.  In the meantime, Tita cooks everyday on the ranch for the family. Everyone is affected by Tita's cooking.  She cooks the most deliciously seductive dishes that bring out sensations of love and desire amongst everyone at the dining table. One day the sensations of passion and sexual desire drove Gertrudis to remove all her clothes due to the hot flashes. She jumped on a horse with one of the revolutionary soldiers and rode off. Dona Elena disowned her existence for it. Every opening chapter starts with food. Author Esquivel does an amazing job incorporating food, such as the salt, onions, and soup broth.  My favorite dialogue takes place during the scene where Pedro walks into the kitchen to watch Tita make mole: ""Preparing the `mole', Tita Knew how contact with fire alters elements. How dough becomes a tortilla. And that a breast untouched by love's fire just isn't a breast, but a useless ball of dough"". This is the best hyperbole/simile that exactly describes my personal feelings. It is so relatable for anyone. ""In one instant Pedro had transformed Tita's breasts from chaste to voluptuous without even touching them"", Esquivel continues. It was a heated scene. Bottom line, you cannot keep lovers separate under one roof. And you cannot force someone to marry a person they don't love. It will only end tragic. Dona Elena finally sees that this living arrangement is not going to work. She suggests that Rosaura and Pedro move to San Antonio, TX in hopes she can keeps the lovers apart.  Dona Elena is obsessed with giving Tita orders and work to which drives her insane. She is released to the doctor for care for her behavior. Dr. John Brown uses an incredible analogy of a matchbox to the human heart, and the processes it should take to recover. If the viewer understands this scene then, the viewer too will understand the ending scene. Meanwhile, Dona Elena and Chencha faced trouble with a pack of malevolence men at the ranch. Dona Elena dies. Rosaura comes back home for the funeral of her mother and has a baby girl. Rosaura is stupid and wants her baby girl to go through the same tradition of taking care of her mother for life without marriage. Tita rejects the idea for what it has done to her own life. And what a surprise, Rosaura is still coming on to Pedro in the bedroom to no avail. She is like the third wheel. She is always sick and needy. She just does not get it. She is the last person to understand what is happening around her. I liked the idea of Dr. John marrying Tita. He was very nice and helpful. I felt bad that the marriage didn't follow through for him. Poor Dr. John Brown was left alone. Dr. John and Gertrudis are my favorite characters of the film. Gertrudis inspires Tita to take hold of what she wants.  Tita tells Dr. John that she cannot marry him. The film jumps well ahead into the future, which is my only complaint of the film. Finally, Rosaura died of too much gas and farts.  Her daughter Esperanza marries Dr. John's son. The ending comes full circle. This movie is well done, but now I have grown an appetite to read the book. It is a classic now. Note: the title, Like Water for Chocolate, refers to how water is simply added to chocolate in Mexico to make hot chocolate. Chocolate releases serotonin in the brain,  which creates the same sensations as if one were to be in love.",1282435200,,5097,4.638580931263858

577313,3,6303153305,"Apparently once you get on the topic of food there is no end to commentary on the subject. Recently I reviewed the food-centered ""Julie and Julia"" about the marathon efforts of a modern day blogger to race through and prepare every recipe in the famous Child's cook book. Now we have this little precursor, a little Mexican import that has the mysteries, portents and usages of food, if not as the central plot then as an important prop in the narration of the story.

And that story? A tale straight out of the ""magical realism"" trend that is still, mainly, in vogue these days in novelistic treatments. In short, a tale of love, longing for love, love thwarted, love twisted, conventional family life Mexican style gone awry, old time views on the place of women and children in the nuclear family structure and all glue together by...endless scenes of the preparation of this and that in the ever present kitchen. A nice sent-up of a film and a cautionary tale or two to make one think.

577315,2,6303153305,"If you like Spanish-language films and are not averse to some of the ""magical realist"" aspects of Latin American cinema, you should enjoy this film.  The problem is that the film was originally released in a 144-minute version, and then was commercially released in a 113-minute version, and neither this Mexican-produced DVD nor the American equivalent apparently is more than 105 minutes long.  (Some ads even say that the Mexican issue is ""about 90 minutes"" -- whatever that means.)  So at best the Mexican release of the DVD, even if 105 minutes long, has cut out 39 minutes of the film!  As another reviewer asked, will it take us until Criterion finally decides to rescue the full film before we can have a look at the original 144-minute version on DVD?  Or even the full 113-minute version that was commercially released, perhaps with the other 31 minutes available as ""extra scenes""?  Or could the distributor do what other DVD distributors have done, and offer BOTH the 144-minute original release AND the 113-minute commercially released versions together on opposite sides of the same disc?  It is simply too much to have the only DVD versions available as truncated as this one and the currently available US version are.  This really is a missed opportunity for the distributor, and for the viewer as well.  Again, the film itself is wonderful, and a great companion to anyone who is reading the book (in Spanish or in English).

577436,3,6303153305,"I missed this movie when it was released back in 1993 but I've wanted to see it for long time because I've read and heard so much praise for it, and from the description it sounds (and tastes) like my kind of movie:

""The passionate Tita (Lumi Cavazos) is in love with Pedro (Marco Leonardi), but her controlling mother (Regina Torne) forbids her from marrying him. When Pedro instead marries her sister, Tita throws herself into her cooking -- and discovers she can transfer her emotions through the food she prepares.""

Passionate romance that is hot like boiling water for chocolate, delicious food that changes the people in the most amazing ways, magical realism - these are the components for a perfect cinema dish. I was salivating while waiting for the DVD to arrive from Netflix...

Well, now I've seen it and even though I like it, it did not seem so magical. Of course, this is very much in the South American literature tradition of magic realism. More than once, Gabriel Garcia-Marquez came to my mind, especially his two major novels, 100 Hundreds Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera. I easily recognized supernatural realities that organically become a part of everyday life in a Mexican Farm in the beginning of the 20th century. Like in ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" the unrequited and undying love that lives through decades and all sorts of obstacles, plays the major part in Like Water for chocolate. The film has some beautifully done emotional and sensual scenes but overall, something is missing. Maybe it is simply impossible to adequately adapt this sort of literature to the screen? Whatever is truly magical, unique, and beautiful in the words, sentences, paragraphs, and chapters where you can create your own vision of what you read simply does not always make you accept fully the film creators' vision. What is meaningful, moving, and passionate on the pages of the brilliantly written book, may lose its charm and seem preposterous or pretentious while being adapted to the film. Like Water for Chocolate is an entertaining movie with the exotic settings and very interesting idea of expressing the repressed love, unfulfilled longing, desperation, and hope in cooking and in the ability to change the people's lives and fates through the meals they consume. It was just difficult for me to fully accept the fateful romance between two main characters and the old tradition of not letting a youngest daughter in the family to get married and to fulfill her own dreams of happiness. Maybe this book requires another cinematic reading with better production values including  more fluid camera work. The way it is, some scenes just end abruptly, and the following scenes would not make much sense. Where the movie succeeds for me, is in my wish to find and read the novel, to capture its magic to which each reader keeps referring, and to try to cook some of the Tita's dishes. The novel which consists of twelve chapters named after twelve months opens each chapter with a new recipe. Now when I think of it, if Tita had been happily married to Pedro, she more likely would not have become such a genius in cooking and there would not have been her delicious recipes for us to enjoy.

Recipes are passed from generation to generation, from mother to daughter most often, or perhaps from aunt to niece, whichever, food and love go together as inherited traits in our character.

For those viewers that compare a book to a movie, you are all living in a true fantasy world.  An author, director, and a screenwriter ALL have totally different views.  So the mental-picture conveyed by all three is going to be totally different.  One should NEVER expect a film to mirror a book verbatim, NEVER.  So the next movie that you decide to go see that comes from a book; just remember that it's the screenwriter and directors `minds eye' that you're viewing and NOT the author.  Expect things to be missing or different!  It wouldn't have the chance to be considered ART then now would it?

That being said...  It's also a good art piece to watch for those who love to watch film for their ART value.  A lot of my artistic friends who love this movie are actually the ones responsible for my watching it also.

I'm not going to get into the descriptive meat of this film, but it does have its humor, passion, desire, treachery, love, remorse, and much more, laced with its bouts of adding emotion to Tita's cooking (this she picks up from her abuelita) is a great way to help her convey or rather lash out how she's feeling about her situation.  You get kept into the happenings of the family, and aren't bothered with what's going on in the world outside; keeping the focus on the family and its story.  The `good-guys' you want to like, and the `bad-guys' you just want to smack around till they come to their senses!",1201564800,2,1604,4.433447098976109

When the movie came out, I wondered if the film maker would adequately appreciate and take the time to reflect the author's wonderful melding of passion for food,  love and longing. The movie almost ""got it"", so I felt it met the requirements of a true ""foodie movie."" I know that some of the descriptions in the book would be a challenge to interpret, especially on a limited budget (as was the case for this film). So, I was going to buy it for my ""true foodie movies"" collection. (e.g. Big Night, Babette's Feast, Chocolat, Eat Drink Man Woman.)

Now, in reading these reviews, I realize that this version cuts food scenes... YUK! The sensuality of touch, desire and sexual consumption intertwined with that of lovingly prepared and consumed food is the whole point of the movie! The title says it all -- trying to sublimate one via the other is like substituting water for chocolate. Those pesky food scenes ARE NOT fluff. They are half of the film's equation. I am SO thankful that I read these reviews, since I won't buy a version until I know it is an uncut version.

Everyone has done the obedient thing,but not what they really wanted. That said, this film needs absolutely no explanation. Everything is viewed through the lens of sexual frustration. Whether it be Tita and Pedro,or the mother and her lost lover,or the sister and her emotionally unavailable husband,everyone is missing the magic ingredient that ignites passion and love.

577744,5,6303153305,"If you are looking for a great introduction to magical realism and food, in cinema, COMO AGUA PARA EL CHOCOLATE (LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE), directed by Alfonso Arau, is the film to see. For those of you unfamiliar with magical realism, this is probably the most straightforward way to explain it.  It is an artistic genre in which magical elements appear in an otherwise realistic setting.  CHOCOLATE is rich in this fine art of storytelling, prevalently seen in Latin American literature.  This splendid adaptation of the novel of the same name, by Laura Esquivel, is beautiful.

Tita (Lumi Cavazos) is the youngest daughter of Elena (Regina Torn), a heartless Mexican woman, who, by tradition, must stay with her mother and take care of her.  This tradition is upheld even when Lumi remains in love with Pedro (Marco Leonardi), who wants her for his wife, but is turned away by Mama Elena, and marries her older sister, Rosaura (Yareli Arizmendi) to be close to her. This is just the beginning of Tita's deeply rooted connection between her emotions and the food she prepares.  Everything from a wedding cake, to a dinner, becomes a reflection of Tita's state.  It also is her way of connecting with Pedro, to show him her love. What's more, those who consume the food absorb Tita's mood and react accordingly.  One example is in the wedding cake she prepares of Rosaura and Pedro.  Tita cries tears of anguish into that batter and everyone who eats it wants to die and gets really ill.

I feel that food and mood are very interconnected.  I have made a habit not to cook when I am angry.  Something always goes wrong when I am unhappy.  I will burn the meal, it will come out too salty or I will almost have an accident with the knife.  Yes, I have had kitchen accidents.  This film confirms that for me.  This film is a very sexy, beautifully acted and sensuous journey for the senses.  Tasty!",1181606400,3,1897,4.648648648648648

Basically, this is the story of Tita, the youngest girl of 3, who is bound by tradition to never marry so that she can care for her heartless mother until she dies.  Tita falls in love with Pedro, who then requests her hand in marriage.  But because of the tradition, the mother decides Pedro can not have Tita as his wife, and promptly offers her eldest daughter!  That is terrible enough, but then when Pedro accepts the offer, it is even more troubling.  His idea is to marry the sister so that he may be close to Tita (a difficult task considering the mother watches them like a hawk).

Over the period of many years, Tita uses her cooking to express herself and her love for and with Pedro and it affects her family in many interesting ways that make this an excellent film.

577851,5,6303153305,"If  ""Babette Feast"" glorified the maxim expression of kindness and became an ""Ode to the friendship"", an unsaid requital for the multiple attentions around a woman in the exile, Like water... walked the dense brume of the magic realism - a classical term proposed by Alejo Carpentier - , so many times expressed in Literature ( Garcia Marquez) that would explain its engaging charm and bewitching attraction. Who can deny a splendid food does not it hide dedication, and a special facet of love inserted; the whole process implies and commits multiple sensations? From the captivating visual decoration until the seductive scents; with the appropriate good wine and candlelight? If not think about the unbeatable French food and tell me if this gastronomic ritual is ruled or not by this observation?

In ""Heist"", a middle ranked thriller directed and written by David Mamet, there is a smart reflection: love or money? (Remember the fatal decision of Alberich in Wagner `s Ring?) and Gene Hackman replies: ""Love of money"".

Perhaps we should include ""the love of food"" as one main ingredient of the magical spell, originated by the scents of the food, as a tantalizing device to inspire and generate passion. There is not a most sincere love than love for food, argued Bernard Shaw. A human film, where sensuality emerges as the main ingredient , an undeniable and enigmatic sensorial spell that seduces, inspires and generates unsaid, unthinkable and unrevealed hidden fantasies.",1144800000,,1481,5.1115702479338845

This movie is an absolute delight in period story-telling, imagery, color and endearing passion. For anyone who enjoys fantasy romance and food, Laura Esquival's touching story is full of warm vibrancy and an exquisite beauty centered around one woman's passion for a childhood sweetheart and cooking (Tita, the main character).

I was literally swept away by the colors, and the intensity of the story, which does have its bittersweet moments. There is a homliness and a feeling of comfort and contentment coming from Tita's kitchen that I connected with immediately.

Like Water For Chocolate by Alfonso Arau is a very romantic mexican movie. It has a very traditional story of the way that true love should be portrayed. Tita & Pedro are the heroine and the hero of the movie. Even with all obstacles in the way (such as the family tradition and Mama Elena- the head of the family), there is no real power that could come between their love, well only death- which is what we see in the story at the end. But even though their souls still remain together.

''Como Agua Para Chocolate'' is a mexican expression which tells how hot chocolate is made. The water has to be boiled to a maximum point. Like Water For Chocolate is an expression which is used to describe an extremely passionate and sexually aroused person- i.e. in love.

Food in the film is a fundamental part, and new recipies are found in almost every scene! Food is a metaphore in which emotions are transmitted to other people to show whatever Tita was feeling at a certain time and place within the movie.

The film contains a vast amount of Magical Realism and fantasy which makes it different from all other films that have happy endings. It shows you what you don`t expect... I highly recommend it if anyone wants to know how real love should still be like... :)",1111968000,6,1454,4.454887218045113
577969,3,6303153305,"This is a Mexican romance novel set in the early part of the 20th century masquerading as a naturalistic melodrama with supernatural overtones, penned by director Alfonso Arau's wife, Laura Esquivel.  We can see from the frequent narrative voice-overs that her novel was beautifully, if idiotically, written. Although ""Chocolate"" strains credulity at times and offends my sensibilities, it provides moments of pleasant diversion.  I am reminded of Dickens, somehow.  I think it is because the mother is so bad, and so many years pass before she gets her comeuppance, which is the way Dickens used to do it.  She is truly a mommy from hell.  She even comes back to haunt her poor last-born daughter.

Tita, the youngest daughter, played sympathetically by Lumi Cavazos, is a sort of Cinderella to her two older sisters and her evil mother.  She has to work in the kitchen and is constantly abused by her mother while forbidden to marry since it is a family tradition that she must take care of her mother in her old age.  Consequently, her true love, Pedro, a wooden pretty boy, is given to her sister instead of her.  He goes along with this since it allows him to be close to Tita.  One gets the sense that Pedro figures he's getting two for the price of one, although initially he acts out a celibate role, the better to whet the appetite, I suppose.

The scene where the oldest daughter is carried off by a swashbuckling rebel, (...) on his horse, reveals the romance novel heart of the movie.  Further swells the fancy of the feminine heart when she returns years later as a revolutionary general (!) in tweed jacket wearing bandoliers of bullets, still beloved by her handsome abductor.

As is the rule in women's POV fairy tales, the men in this movie are without personality: they just fill the roles as heroes, lovers and villains.  What counts is the interaction between the women and the fulfillment of romantic notions.  Nonetheless, there are a number of nice touches, especially the sumptuous feasts including such delectables as baked quail with rose petal sauce, chillis with walnuts, and corn fritters with syrup.  Yummy!",1109808000,9,2137,4.829670329670329

The scene is great, the storyline is wonderful. The ending is truly bitter sweet. Like water for chocolate... all I can say is, it's wonderful. A must see for movie fans worldwide. I have to note that it's better to see the movie in spanish language with english subtitle and not the english dubbed version. The direct translation of spanish to english is horrible.

Regardless, my favourite character in the movie is the priest. Look at his expression throughout the movie... it's superb! I especially love the part where he ate the wedding cake... great acting! He should get an oscar for eating the cake alone!

577971,4,6303153305,"This is an ""R"" rated movie but barely so.  There is some nudity and adult situations but it is really a delightful story.  It is about a young girl whose life is pre-ordained to be that of a spinster caring for her parents.  In her youth, she falls in love but her domineering mother will not allow her to marry.  The story moves on from there in a way that amuses, endears, angers, and, occassionally, confuses us.  It has a kind of mystical nature to it and much of it is tied into the special family recipes.  Apparently, the original book was both novel and cook book.  This is probably not a good movie to see on an empty stomach.

The acting is very good.  The role of the mother is excellently protrayed as cold, and calculating.  One sister is free-wheeling while the other tends to take after mom.  There are many other characters including a couple of suitors, maids, and others who give the story a multi-dimensioned flavor.  It is the heroine of the story, Tita, who carries the movie.  Her innocence, patience, sincerity et. al. leaves no doubt as to whom we are cheering for.  The ending is where some of the confusion comes in.  You can decide for yourselves what to think of it.  I might have chosen a different ending but it probably wouldn't have had the same impact that this movies brings.

The problem is that out of her 3 sisters, it is she the youngest who has a suitor who has fallen in love with her and she with him. Her mother is a very strict stern woman who will not allow her to marry. So Pedro (Tita's suitor) decides that he will marry her older sister to be close to Tita. Pedro's decision is questioned throughout the movie. Was his decision wise or foolish? At one point Tita asks him why didn't you just ask me to run away with you. Did he take the coward's way out by marrying someone he did not love or was that a true sacrifice of love. Regardless, their love is strong and always present throughout their lives. Tita spends most of her time in the kitchen preparing family meals and her emotions go directly into the foods she prepares. I found this facinating. Her mother forces Tita to put aside her emotions and bake the wedding cake. Well Tita starts to cry for her lost love while she is mixing the cake batter and her tears fall into it. When the guests eat the cake, each person is taken over by deep meloncholy in remember their own unrequited love. And a massive crying and outpouring of emotions take over the wedding. It's funny yet profund in showing how each one of us has a story of a lost love. The movie is great. I found so much enjoyment in it.

I have only given the DVD two stars, however, (and that is being generous), because approximately one-sixth of the film (18 of its original 123 minutes) has been inexplicably cut, leaving a sadly truncated 105-minute version.  It is unclear why Buena Vista Home Entertainment chose to delete nearly a sixth of the film, but even if they believed that a shorter version would appeal to a wider audience (maybe, maybe not), it is unforgivable that they did not include the missing footage as ""deleted scenes"" so that those who wanted to see the entire film would be able to do so.  This is simply too big a cut for buyers to accept (even at this rather attractive price).  Rather than pay for a film that has been so badly butchered (the only worse case I know of is the Region 2 (European) version of ""The Big Country,"" from which nearly an hour was cut, for reasons no one can explain), I will avoid buying this film on DVD until Buena Vista provides a ""Collector's"" or ""Director's Cut"" version that restores the film -- one way or another -- to its full original length.",1078704000,427,1239,4.493333333333333

578066,4,6303153305,"""Como agua para chocolate"" is a fabulous feast of film, pun intended for the dollops of cooking that make a big chunk of the movie.
Set in Mexico at the turn of the century, Tita is doomed never to marry. Her family's tradition requires the first born daughter to spend her life taking care of her mother until death. But Tita is in love with Pedro, and he with her. Since he cannot marry Tita, he asks for the hand of her sister, in order to be near Tita. Tita's third sister runs off with a group of guerillas fighting in the civil war. The movie follows Tita and Pedro through 1932.
Along the way, the movie manages to develop some interesting themes about the roles of women in Mexico. The women in the movie are repressed in, and yet empowered by, the kitchen which gives them a mystical control over everyone who eats their meals. Tita, in particular, is forced into the kitchen by her mother and she learns to appropriate the kitchen as her tool of revenge. Food also creates a bound between women that eludes time.
Mexican national identity is explored with the mix (often a clash) of cultures that seem to define Mexican History -- Spanish colonialism and its idiosynchracies, indigenous beliefs and traditions, and to an extent American influences.
While not a deeply profound film, it is insightful, well done (no food pun intended) and a very refreshing change of tone for movie buffs -- the direction, the cinematography and the narrative lush with a magical quality. It's a tribute to an old vision of romantic love, a love that transcends time, and overcomes distance, madness, and even the direct interference of Tita's family. Some viewers may find this style and tone slow, even boring. But for those who enjoy contemplative film making this is a very enjoyable treat.

In fact, she eventually uses food as a weapon against the sister whom she has betrayed. She has the opportunity to learn as much about genuine love as she knows about food and to nurture herself. Instead, she is literally consumed by lust. This had the potential to be a really good story about self love that is shared with others, like food often is.",1044835200,6,846,4.841379310344828

578119,5,6303153305,"This film is a feast for the eyes. Based upon the best selling novela of the same name by Laura Esquivel, who also wrote the screenplay, the film successfully captures this tale of forbidden love. Well directed by Laura Esquivel's husband, Alfonso Arau (The Magnificent Ambersons, A Walk In the Clouds), the cast delivers wonderful performances in this mystical tale.

During the early twentieth century in Mexico, just south of the border, a girl catches the eye of boy. A number of years later, the boy, Pedro, now a young man, speaks to the girl, Tita, now a young woman, and declares his heartfelt, passionate love for her. Pedro (Marco Leonardi) wants Tita (Lumi Cavazos) to marry him.

He and his father meet with Tita's mother, Elena (Regina Torne), and ask if she would give her consent to a union between Pedro and Tita, Elena's youngest daughter. Elena forbids such a marriage to take place, as it is an unbroken family tradition that the youngest daughter remain single, so that she may take care of her mother until the mother dies. Such is the destiny of Tita. Elena, instead, cruelly offers to have her oldest daughter, Rosaura (Yareli Arizmendi), marry Pedro.

Surprisingly, Pedro agrees to marry Rosaura, his twisted logic being that this is the only way he can be close to Tita. Thus, begins an untenable situation. Tita, forced by her selfish, harridan of a mother to prepare the wedding feast for Rosaura and Pedro, begins a lifelong sublimation of her passion and emotions with food. Its mystical properties become self evident in the expert hands of Tita, as she becomes a superlative cook. She has the ability to imbue the food that she prepares with the fervor and feelings, both good and bad, that she dare not express. Her love, her pain, her passion is evident in every delightful and delicious dish that she creates, and her feelings manifest themselves in those who ingest her meals.

This is a glorious film about love, filled with mystical, magical, and supernatural portents. Sensual and evocative, it details the road that Tita and Pedro must travel before their journey is complete. Wonderfully acted and beautifully told, theirs is a story that will long linger in the mind of the viewer. Awash in amber tones, the brilliant cinematography contributes to the mystical properties of this film. Sumptuous and surreal, it is a feast for the eyes and not to be missed. Bravo!

The DVD offers clear visuals and great sound. It does not offer much in the way of special features. Watch it in the original Spanish with English subtitles in order to retain the intended flavor of this superlative film.",1026604800,165,2628,4.844097995545657
578120,5,6303153305,"I first saw this film when I was in Berkeley. I fell in love with it. There are many reviewers here who have given summary of the story as well as the emotional timbre and the magical realism of the film.
Magical realism is not a stranger in the Latin American literature . Witness Colombia's Nobel Prize Winner in Literature, Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his One Hundred Years of Solitude as well as his other works.
The one interesting part of the film that no reviewers have touched so far is the American doctor in the film, Dr. Brown. In the original Spanish version, he speaks Spanish with a very American accent. Tita actually marries Dr. Brown. Dr. Brown understands her lovesick heart for her true love Pedro. Dr. Brown relents her to go back to Pedro (what an understanding guy !! This American doctor of all people!!). He does warn her, that she should do it slowly, because if she pours all her love at once, it is like all the matches are lit up all at once and that starts an uncontrolled fire. Of course, Tita, being deprived of Pedro's love for such a long time, wants all his love at once, like wanting to be flooded with love. And as Dr. Brown warned, fire did start and burns the house where they were at, and the lovers tragically die, together.
There was comment by several people that they don't see what is so great about this movie and why people get so emotional about it. I once saw the film Joy Luck Club with a guy, and he could not understand why people were crying. I realized that people are really different. Of course, when there is a sports game on, I don't understand why some people are so crazy and emotional about sports either....
In other words, this film really appeals to emotions based on love, fidelity, romance.... and some people may say it is a women's thing ... but romance is a two way street... you cannot have romance coming only from one side. Tita's love could not have been fulfilled unless Pedro was also seeking to fulfill this love for her. This love was mutual for both of them, just that circumstances and history and tradition hindered that love.
Yes, the original languages of the film is always superior to the dubbed version. I have not seen a dubbed version that is a good one.

578127,5,6303153305,"A thrilling, intoxicating masterpiece, ""Like Water for Chocolate"" will leave you hungry, happy and hung over with its surreal vision and unforgettable performances.  Some of the film's charm lies in its uncompromising vision of what it must be like to be a poor, Mexican woman, surrounded by angry sisters and petty jealousies.  The food is a miracle of texture and authenticity that makes the book a recipe lover's dream.  But the spiritual aspects of the movie take it someplacve else altogether....by tying food and unseen forces together, the author and director have fashioned love as a cycle of human emotion coupled with betrayal and passion.  Believers and non-believers alike are asked to suspend judgement and just BE with this movie, for it raises issues and themes rarely imagined or acheived on film.  A few sequences are startling - such as a wedding party where every guest is gastronimically infected by a soup that is stewed with the tears of our protagonist, and they all end up regurgitating the mixture, and in the end, understanding that true love should not be gambled away for money or superiority.  Another sequence, where the middle daughter Gertudis, is literally kidnapped by a horse riding gunslinger while she sits alone in an outhouse doing her business, is hysterical, yet also painful to watch, because it symbolizes the woman's need for free choice in a world where men have so much of the power.  Besides, any couple who has eloped or married without their parent's blessings will quickly make the connection to their own experience.  If you can keep up with the subtitles, I'd advise against a dubbed version, for in its Spanish - eloquent, funny and dramatic - the film c aptures its truest form of communication.  And food as metaphor - used in other terrific fims like ""Babette's Feast"" - has never been presented in such an awe inspiring manner.

578401,4,6303153305,"This much loved Mexican tale is at once original, vibrant, sensual, funny, and passionate. The premise is simple: a girl, Tita, loves a man (although I cannot think of his character's name now) from the time she is young. He is also desperately in love with her. Tita is mistreated by her mother who insists that Tita's place in the family and in life is to never wed and to take care of her, and therefore prefers the charm of being in the kitchen with her grandmother. Tita learns all the secrets of working magic in the kitchen. Eventually Tita's beloved sister runs away, and the remaining sister ends up marrying the man who is Tita's one true love. This makes Tita desperately sad (and her sadness magically ends up in the food she cooks for the wedding party), but eventually she realises that her man only married Tita's sister in order to be close to her. At some point Tita's mother dies, and this creates a lot of problems for Tita. Throughout the film, Tita's culinary creations reflect the person herself-her sadness, her love, her beauty, her revenge, and so on. The film shows the magic inherent in everything Tita touches. Of course, at some point Tita leaves (if I recall she got very ill-perhaps emotionally ill). Tita ends up marrying a man and having a child. And when her child grows up, he falls in love with and marries the child of Tita's sister and Tita's one true love (the sister's husband).

578530,5,6303153305,".....if you can get the same amount of passion as these two lovers.
I absolutely adore this sensual, quirky romantic comedy drama about forbidden love and family ties set in early twentieth century Mexico.
When Tita,  the youngest of three daughters, falls in love with Pedro, a local lad, it  seems only right that the two should marry and live happily ever after.  But Tita's strict and cold-hearted mother has other ideas; according to a  family tradition the youngest daughter in the family must stay at home and  take care of her mother until she dies and thus making marriage at the  bottom of the list of priorities.  Determined to stick to it,  Tita's  mother forbids the marriage and instead offers the hand of her eldest  daughter to Pedro. Believing that through marrying her sister it will mean  remaining close to Tita, Pedro consents without fully realising the strain  on the family this move will involve....
This film maintains it's charm,  passion and wit all the way through and there are also really good  performances from everyone especially Lumi Cavazos as the sexually  frustrated heroine Tita.
I confess to being shocked by all the nudity but  then in the Latin countries nudity is no big deal and it is not at all  gratuitous - so if you're hiring for titilation then you'll be  disappointed
Just in case you're confused by the seemingly nonsensical  title it translates into ""Como Agua Para Chocolate"" in Spanish  and is a South American idiom used to describe someone who is sexually  frustrated.  And there is certainly plenty of that here.....",956620800,47,1573,4.856603773584905

In both book and movie,  this is a tale of the tortures of repressed emotion. The youngest daughter  of cold, powerful, and autocratic mother, Tita learns that she is forbidden  to marry because she is designated to care for her mother in her old age.  Rejected as a baby by her mother, Tita grew up in the kitchen, nurtured by  the loving cook. Blocked at every turn from acting on her emotions, Tita  magically transmits her frustrated and repressed feelings through her  food.
This is a story filled with the sort of simplicity and symbolism of  legends and fairy tales. The food is stunning and complex, and adds yet  another level of sensuous symbolism. With either the book or the movie, you  will be swept into romantic allegory.",953856000,5,997,4.672413793103448

(Better than the dubbing in those lame, 1960s Godzilla movies from Japan.)  Its better that you add the option for English subtitles. Woman will like  it because it shows the struggle for independence by a woman, while feeding  their ""chick-flick"" taste. Men like it because it isn't too  ""feme"" for our sensitive mentalities.

I wanted to give this 5 stars because I love this story so  much, but the DVD has a lot of artifacts from what appears to be a fairly  battered copy of the film. The most salient artifacts are the reel cues  (which appear as ragged circles along the right edge, centered vertically.)

578622,5,6303153305,"""Como agua para chocolate"" truly takes Laura Esquivel's emotional and magical story and brings it to life.  Taking the romance of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and combining it with the magic from  ""Cinderella"", ""Como agua para chocolate"" includes  'ingredients' for almost any viewer.  With the film's predominantly female  cast along with the kitchen as the main setting, many often assume that  this film only pleases a female audience.  However, anyone searching for a  multisensory experience. in which taste, smell and touch seem to become  possible, should rent this movie.  Even those who are unable to understand  the words, whether they be in english or spanish, will never feel left out  during this film.  The director's interpretation of color, ilumination and  angles, along with the actors' facial expressions and body language, is  what truly make this film magical.  Esquivel succeeds in her novel by  making a reader savor each one of her words and descriptions, and this  adaptation, even without the words, allows its audience to savor and  experience the same themes of unconditional love, struggle and liberation.  Scenes of passion and frustration, of sadness and sheer relief, only add to  the film's ability to reach out and become a story of our very own.  From  the first moment when the narrator talks to us while peeling an onion, we  are invited into Tita's kitchen and asked to join this family on a journey.  The only problem is being able to leave Mama Elena's ranch at the end of  the film and return to 'reality.'  ""Como agua para chocolate"" is  truly HOT, and anyone who finishes this film without being entertained as  well as emotionally satisfied has not taken in the whole experience that  this film has to offer.",945475200,52,1742,4.968641114982578

In order to  release her overwhelming emotion, Tita cooks, knits, and learns of the  spirit of shamanism.  The lighting, the music, and the expressive actions  of the young woman symbolize her frustration, anguish, and attempt at  liberation.

The principal character, Tita, is subjected to a life of servatude to her mother because of the family tradition that decrees the  youngest daughter must give up everything to provide for her mother.  She  is subjected to being the family cook, her mother's caretaker, and the  right not to marry until the death of her mother.  The movie takes you  through this girl's life as she encounters the stuggles of this  arrangement.  Alfonso Arau did a tremendous job visualizing the  repression and liberation of Tita.  Althogh the descriptions that flavor  the novel this movie is based on are missing, the visual image clearly  overcompensates for the lack of description.  Overall this movie has a  captivation story that carrries you into the life of Tita and her family.  Como Agua Para Chocolate definately will relate better to the female  viewers because so many of Tita's experiences, from cooking, to nursing a  baby, to falling in love, are common to the life of a woman",945302400,11,1067,4.932203389830509
578625,5,6303153305,"Lumi Cavazos blazes in a role that could have lapsed into Victorian mad-woman-in-the-attic melodrama.  Instead, Cavazos internalizes the frustrations of her character and conveys a mountain of meaning with just a  look, a smile or a frown.
The film is sensual, playful, and extremely  evocative.  It helps that the source material, Laura Esquivel's novel, is  also exquisite and unusual (using recipes as a structural device, much in  the way diary entries have traditionally done).  Alfonso Arau visualizes  the novel brilliantly; this was one rare case where the literary work and  the film are complementary instead of in competition. Ironic, then, that  this bittersweet romance of almost mythic emotional force came from the  collaboration of Esquivel and Arau, who are divorced.
Minor side note --  all the performances are great, the cinematography stunning (the final love  scene ranks among the very best I've seen) and the narrative completely  engaging.  This one broke the record set by La Cage aux Folles for  highest-grossing foreign film in the U.S. in its time, and a well deserved  honour.",945129600,,1106,5.264367816091954
