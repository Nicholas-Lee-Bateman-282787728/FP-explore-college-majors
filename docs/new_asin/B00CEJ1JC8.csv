Every goal was shown, even the pointless goals, which made the movie longer than probably necessary.",1518652800,,265,4.911111111111111

8580919,1,B00CEJ1JC8,"This was a big disappointment. The picture quality was awful - any time there was quick motion on the screen, players running, shooting etc., parts of the picture would jump up and down. Unwatchable. Strangely enough, the picture was okay on the computer - but I didn't buy it to watch on my computer. All my other DVDs, including several Man Utd season reviews played just fine, so it's not the DVD player. I returned it and requested a replacement, assuming it was a one-off problem, but the replacement did the same thing. Incidentally, putting the jumpy bits aside, if you're thinking that this was going to have a particularly good picture because it's been 'remastered', think again - it doesn't look much better than my old VHS copy. I think when they say 'remastered', they mean 'copied it from a video to a DVD'.",1485734400,,821,4.6689655172413795
