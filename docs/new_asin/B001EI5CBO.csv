8298268,5,B001EI5CBO,"This provides fascinating (and often, very moving) background to the excellent film, Kundun, that tells the story of the Chinese invasion of Tibet and the flight of the 14th Dalai Lama.",1474070400,,185,5.0
8298269,5,B001EI5CBO,"Lovers of KUNDAN will want this alongside it on
their dvd shelf.  It magnified my understanding,
appreciation and enjoyment of Kundan and had
ample contributions by the current Dalai Lama.
The location filming in in India and Morocco combined
with rare archival Tibet footage was breathtaking.  Director
Scorsese may be the best of his generation.",1394409600,,347,5.290909090909091
8298270,3,B001EI5CBO,"After watching the movie Kundun, I was eager for more. This movie made my Scorsese was truly a masterpiece. It captured a time and place in history that many have never and will never see, gives you background history in his the life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama but all done with essentially unknowns; actors and actresses who were Tibetan and some related as well.  I purchased this DVD to learn more about that experience but what this was instead was a dull recap of taping scenes, some narrative. For the cost, very disappointing.",1392508800,,537,4.652631578947369
8298271,4,B001EI5CBO,"loved the movie Kundun so I had to get the behind the scenes film. Very glad I did, wonderful film",1388534400,,98,3.95
8298272,5,B001EI5CBO,"This film Kundun is as a document for Tibetian and the world to know the history of Dalai Lama XIV. God bless you all. This KUNDUN movie is very fantastic . MARTIN SCORSESE and MELISSA MATHISON and staff caught the emotional of spirits in this film .How their best talents are. I almost watch my KUNDUN movie by every night before sleeping. I've wondered the monks and DALAI LAMA's people acted so well like they lived into the real event.

Talking or asking or begging the China communist are useless and like speaking with the walls. They've never listened .
Only hoping and waiting the young generations of CHINESES changing.

8298273,5,B001EI5CBO,"This is a documentary of the making of the Kundun film, which is a fantastic movie for all spiritual seekers.  Don't miss it.  Once you've seen Kundun, you may well enjoy In Search of Kundun as well.  It fills in some of the historical background of the period covered in Kundun.  Gives a glimpse of Scorsese's own spiritual experience with the project.  Seekers will not be disappointed.",1323302400,7,388,4.731343283582089
8298274,5,B001EI5CBO,"I will watch anything with a Tibetan Buddhist theme. I love the Dalai Lama, even though I grew up Baptist. I own a copy of Kundun, and have watched it, oh, maybe five times. Watching In Search of Kundun simply heightened my appreciation for the film, and in no way ruined my sense of being ""in"" the world that director Martin Scorsese creates through his film. Scorsese is not Buddhist, and yet he felt passionately about making this film realistically Tibetan; he does this so well that his film is perhaps more Tibetan than parts of current-day Tibet (Lhasa, for instance), because of the Chinese rule of formerly independent Tibet. Also, you get a sense of Scorsese, the man, and learn some of the history of Tibet that is followed in Kundun. Recommended!",1262563200,21,758,4.706766917293233
8298275,4,B001EI5CBO,"My wife had first run across the advertisement for this engaging DVD,billed as ""now available"" in a magazine called Buddha Dharma. It was anything but available at or through Borders or Barnes and Noble. Amazon was the first to offer it,and at a discounted price, albeit several months later. It was worth the wait.
Martin Scorcese has produced a ""making of"" stand-alone DVD on his modern classic film,Kundun. The story of this magnificent production is both a tribute to the filmmaker as well as the film in its gentle reflection and shared moments with cast, crew and director as well as The Dalai Lama himself.",1234137600,25,613,4.847619047619047
8298276,5,B001EI5CBO,"I hunted high and low for this film after seeing it years ago on the Sundance Channel.  I found it at an obscure online movie rental site and have the VHS version of it.  I will definitely buy this, and here's why:

Not every body knows about the problems in Tibet and many do not understand His Holiness and how he can have compassion for all life forms, not only human.  Every living being has the potential of being a human, the ultimate life form; not for reasons many think.  Every sentient being has a consciousness and it's the MIND associated with the consciousness which holds this potential to develop.

This film not only shows how it was made, but gives insight into His Holiness' family, how he was raised, how he loves his Tibet and I say everyone should buy this film to support more of these films to be made. I also suggest buying Kundun as it makes a perfect set, the film and the extras on it's own disc.",1224115200,42,923,4.337209302325581
