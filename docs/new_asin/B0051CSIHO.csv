8452547,4,B0051CSIHO,"This DVD clearly explains and demonstrates the basics:  how to hold the mandolin; basic right-hand and left-hand technique; basic open and closed (barre or chop) chords; and simple single-note leads on a few fiddle tunes.  If you are completely new to the mandolin and have little experience with stringed instruments generally, this DVD is better than a lot of other introductory material, since it goes slowly and gets you playing songs in a way that never gets too complicated.  A lot of ""beginner's"" material moves too fast too quickly for true beginners.  But if you have played a little mandolin, or have a fair amount of guitar experience, this DVD will probably move too slowly for you.  It does not get to Bill Monroe-type chop chords.  The ones here work perfectly well, and I still use them a lot, but they are not the classic bluegrass chop chords.  This makes total sense for beginners, since the Monroe-style chords are harder to play.  Also, the leads here are very simplified.  Again, this makes great sense for total beginners who would find it hard to play a string of eighth notes fast enough to feel like they were really playing the tune.  But if you have played a bunch of fiddle tunes on the guitar, these versions of Old Joe Clark etc. will likely be too simple for you.  If you've played some mandolin or are pretty experienced on the guitar, maybe start instead with Butch Baldassari's DVD's, which treat the basics but move quickly to more challenging material. If you sound like the target audience for this DVD, buy it, it will help you lay a good foundation, and Baldassari's DVD's will then be a good next step.",1454025600,,1642,4.686411149825784

8452550,5,B0051CSIHO,"This is just what you need to get started.  Steve Kaufman walks you through the basics, and does it with a great sense of humor and patience.  If you've never played mandolin before this is a great place to start.  This DVD is full of great tips and exercises, so it's giving me (a complete novice) a lot more confidence and really jump-starting the learning process.  This one's a great choice.",1344297600,2,395,4.52112676056338
