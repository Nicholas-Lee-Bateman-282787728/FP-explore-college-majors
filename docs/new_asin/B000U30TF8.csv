It's unreal, barely anything about Paris, just some old man with shoe-polished hair showing off some older pretty asian woman he's bagged, posing in Paris.  The first 5 minutes is spent watching traffic!!!  I've never seen such trash.  I'm glad I got it from the library and didn't spend money on it.  I wanted to see the Eiffel Tower, which showed about 30 seconds of blurry footage from far away, then the 2 of them going on and on about the traffic.  This is the worst video I've ever seen, ever, about anything.",1343433600,,559,4.431372549019608
8212047,1,B000U30TF8,"I agree with the other reviewer. This is a shockingly bad video for anyone interested in visiting Paris or just enjoying armchair tourism. It's an amateur video with 1980s production values, including annoying video-trick transitions you expect to see in home videos.  The content shows the Eiffel Tower briefly, then, looks at the hosts at dusk marveling at how the traffic gets around the Arch de Triumphe, over and over again. There's no background information, and the narrative consists of the hosts being thunderstuck by everything they see. The female speaks French, so her co-host makes her say everything in French to show her off. We see a translation as she speaks, yet he makes her repeat everything in English.  It's slow-going. There is one interminable interview with a rep from Christian Dior that makes the video appear to have been highjacked to become a perfume infomercial. The interviews don't appear to edited, so they're tedious. It looks like a night or two was spent shooting footage of the same trip down the Champs Elysees with a side trip over the to Moulin Rouge. This is milked for all its worth. Then, we watch our hosts eat crepes and listen to a bad singer. I'm venting because I was incensed that this could in any way represent an overview of Paris or be considered ""The Beauty of Paris.""  Paris was never so poorly served.",1331251200,,1358,4.794871794871795
8212048,1,B000U30TF8,"By all rights this should be NO stars.  We borrowed this video from our library and fortunately did not purchase it.  It shows very little of Paris and has very poor production.  The tour guides interview a few people, show some street scenes (mostly of moving cars) and have a dessert.  Photography is poor, only a few locations are shown, and the narration contains no information for someone visiting Paris - it is just a conversation between the hosts.",1315180800,,456,4.734177215189874
