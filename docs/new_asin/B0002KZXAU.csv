2102738,4,B0002KZXAU,"I was quite thrilled when I heard someone had recorded the complete etudes for DVD.  Highly educational to watch for an amateur pianist.  This review will address two points:  The Instrument and Audio Synchronization.

The Instrument.

It was clear from the opening octaves of Op. 10 #1 that the star of the show was not Ms. Lisitsa but...the bass register of the Bosendorfer.  Talk about an orchestra in a box.  Its presence haunts (in a good way) the entire recording.

Bosendorfers are generally lightly regulated and this 1925 275 is no exception - in fact I have a feeling it is a bit over-enginereed.

This allows the performer to play with considerable ease and do some pretty spectacular things.  Note the feather touch of Op. 25 #6 (thirds).  Splendid.  Remind me to record the etudes on this instrument.

Audio (A)synchronization.

With this ambitious project (Etudes AND DVD), its pretty much 'damned if you do, damned if you don't'.  That is, if you choose to record uncut, you risk having people used to edited perfection on CDs dismiss the recording as amateur.  If you dub, you risk having people cry fraud!  Sigh.

It is a shame, but they chose pretty much what they had to do in today's world.  Dub.  One reviewer mentioned 40% of the material.  I think that is high.  The suspension of disbelief is held intact for most of the DVD.  You may think the sound is late for quite a bit of the recording, but it is actually the delayed action of the instrument.  This may be evident at the beginning of Op. 10 #3, and why would they dub that?

I would have preferred to just let the girl play.  She has technique to burn.  I can live with a few mistakes.  Take Op. 10 #1.  This one is definitely uncut.  This is actually one of the harder etudes, yet she really makes it look easy.  And dead even as well.  Yet, there are a couple of misses. So what.  And Op. 25 #6 (thirds) is also uncut - and she is just about perfect.  If you want a lesson in physical economy, watch her play this etude.  It cannot be approached better.

I recommend this DVD highly.  It is certainly a 'pianists' video and I guarantee you will learn a lot from it.  I took a star away for the audio sync, but don't blame her.  Blame us.

And mortgage the house.  Buy Bosendorfer.",1108080000,73,2263,4.43520782396088
2102739,5,B0002KZXAU,"In my forty years of collecting recordings, I have acquired or heard at least a couple of dozen versions of the complete Chopin Etudes.  The first thing I can say is that even if this recording by Valentina Lisitsa were an audio-only CD, I would still be very happy to own it.  I would place it among my top two versions, the other being by Juana Zayes.  Lisitsa is not only magnficent technically and tonally, but is much more musically compelling, and plays with much greater imagination, than such famous pianists as Maurizio Pollini (dull and colorless) or Vladimir Ashkenazy (who rarely offers anything more than mere competence).  Her interpretations are personal, but never sound willful or mannered.

Add to this the stunning video production and excellent, rich sound, and this becomes a truly exceptional document.  The camera work is breathtakingly imaginative, with beautiful lighting and multiple camera angles that exchange or crossfade into one another, never haphazardly or randomly, but always in a way that illuminates the technical demands of the particular Etude being played and enhances the musical experience.  This DVD is a magnificent achievement, and I recommend it highly.",1104710400,20,1199,5.213541666666667
2102740,3,B0002KZXAU,"It's not Cziffra, Martha Argerich or Vladimir Horowitz.

As come guy stated before, there's nothing wrong in someone playing the Chopin Etudes at a graduate level, but, please, call that so.

I bought it 5 years ago and would buy again. From 2004 untill now, I'vemet her 2 times in person and heard several recordings. She doesn't seem to get mature, not at all.

But she's an interesting young artist. I fear she'll never be more than that.",1102204800,16,441,4.628205128205129
2102741,5,B0002KZXAU,"Ukrainian virtuosa, Valentina Lisitsa, is nicely filmed playing the Chopin etudes from Opus 10 and 25. Her Bosendorfer piano is well recorded in Dolby Digital / PCM Stereo sound. I particularly liked the transitions from one etude to the next. As a pianist, I enjoyed the various camera angles that display Lisitsa's hands and technique. In general, her interpretation of each piece allows the music to ""breathe."" Her playing is reminiscent of Rachmaninov's style...almost improvisatory in long melodic phrases but taught and rhythmic when needed. A wonderful first dvd from a rising star. Check out her amazing performance of the fugue section of Beethoven's ""Hammerklavier"" sonata: [...]",1100736000,10,689,5.4485981308411215
2102742,2,B0002KZXAU,"The music on this DVD is, for the most part, solid. Some of her interpretations are genuinely exciting. Her Op. 25 #5 is the only one I really disliked.

HOWEVER, if you think you're going to be watching a ""live"", uncut performance, you'll be disappointed. In probably 40+ percent of this DVD, the audio is noticeably out of synch with the video.

Some etudes, like Op. 10 #2, are out of synch right from the start. Others *gradually* become out of synch - a clear sign that what you're hearing is from a different performance than the one you're watching.

In some cases, you can see her playing wrong notes (if you know the pieces anyway) but you hear the correct ones.

Another example of ""fraud"": At the beginning of Op. 25 #3, you see her smiling, hands bouncing away. We go to a different angle where she's not smiling, then right back to the shot where she's smiling. Apparently, she can't even make it through one etude in a single take! (I'm sure she can but the director certainly casts doubt by combining these different takes).

Anyway, if you want to watch an uncut performance of hers, go to her website and watch the video in which she attempts the Carmen Variations.

A final note on the DVD's special features: There are none.",1099785600,28,1243,4.526785714285714
2102743,5,B0002KZXAU,"I've watched this several times, and I agree that this is a DVD worth purchasing.  For pianists, especially, it's instructive to watch an artist with perfect technique.  She clearly plays these pieces with ease, which is necessary if one hopes to play them musically, rather than as practice pieces.

As far as musical inspiration is concerned, this set is interesting, but falls a little short of the more well-known recordings (Pollini, Cortot, Ashkenazy, etc).  Yet there are many moments of real poignancy here, and many of her tempos depart from the mainstream, usually with very good effect.  I was impressed by the middle section of 25/10, which she plays very slowly, giving it a haunting quality.  I was astounded by the lightness of touch in 25/6 and the ease with which she tosses of 10/1.  In her hands, 25/9 is scintilating and 10/4 breathes fire.  My main disappointment was with the last two.  Both sounded a bit mechanical - I percieved neither the wind-swept desolation of 25/11 nor the surging pathos of 25/12.

Sound quality is first rate.  The camera work is especially nice.  I found it to be a perfect blend of angles - the hands are shown at the appropriate times, but the camera cuts to various views of the artist frequently enough that the audience is always aware of her presence as a person.  We catch her smiling on multiple occasions (which I understand is a trademark of hers) but she never succumbs to the sort of contortions which are so distracting in some artists.  The back and forth cutting of the camera in the middle section of 10/4 is clever and very effective.  Clearly, the video people were very in tune with the whole music making experience and probably intimately familiar with the pieces.

Overall, the set is entertaining and instructive from beginning to end and well worth adding to any collection.  For anyone who has actually learned any of these works (and I have) this video is full of superb insight.",1095379200,28,1955,4.770833333333333
2102744,5,B0002KZXAU,"Valentina Lisitsa is a superb artist.  She possesses tremendous technical skill and is musically wonderful.  Her playing appears effortless.

Hopefully, Ms. Lisitsa will produce additional recordings of great pieces in the near future.",1091923200,4,340,5.339622641509434
2102745,5,B0002KZXAU,I purchased this DVD because I wanted one which enbodied all the Etudes.  The DVD arrived and straight away I played it and was dumbfounded.  I was so amazed at the magnificant rendering by Valentina Lisitsa that I have purchased two more copies for friends as Christmas presents.  They are now on the way.  I have played the DVD practically day after day and can't leave it for long before listening again!  Valentina's hands are so strong yet they can slide along the keyboard with no effort when required.  She really feels the music and I cannot tell which Etude I like best but it probably would be the Revolutionary Etude in C minor Op. 10 No 12.  Opus 25 No 11 is also a favourite but then it is hard to choose which is the best they are all awesome.,1321660800,3,757,4.326241134751773

As to the composition- may I say that- along w the Goldberg and the WTC- it is hard to comprehend- for me- such genius!!

I could find this DvD in France ( !!! ) , and once some Zoning problems were solved out, I must confess I had one of the most unbelievable experiences in my amateur Pianist's life.....

  I know all these Studies by heart and studied most of them : first, I couldn't believe my eyes, but even when closing them the impression remained.

  Well,I adore Nicola Lugansky's rendering of them, which seems to be one of the best ones, but it was AWE I felt when looking at Valentina's fingers , apparently hovering a few centimeters above the Keyboard, as if a sort of magical trick gave the keys instruction to depress just because the fingers were above them....

  I am lucky enough to own Valentina's THREE DvD's and the impression is always nearly the same.

As for the Bsendorfer 275 type, I read the complete story of bringing it back from the sinister back office of a British shop, where they had left it to oblivion, up to the final setting by genuine Bsendorfer Technicians, in the US Country where Valentina Lisitsa lives with her family...

2102750,5,B0002KZXAU,"I give this video a five star rating.  The pianist is astonishing!  I have been fortunate enough to have been intimately acquainted with many of these Chopin Etudes and understand the technical problems that a pianist is confronted with, given the limitations of one's own anatomy.  Never mind what I have read and heard about the lack of synchronization between the actual video camera and this rendition on the piano.  This video is a great learning tool for any pianist who aspires to play any one of these wonderful preludes.

This girl's technique is astonishing and one almost uses the phrase "" I see and hear it but still can't believe it!""Add to that the fact that she is extremely attractive makes this a most desirable DVD. My only slight reservation is that the Swan Songs are really very sad and mournful but then a lot of Schubert songs are thus; This is definitely not the disc to play if one is feeling down in the dumps!
none-the-less it is very beautifully played and the idea of displaying the text of the songs is very helpful and makes the enjoyment even greater On DTS the sound of the Bosendorfer piano is superb .When one listens to this through top-end ear phones the result is other worldly and the base is sumptuous.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that she's playing the works of one of the greatest composers in human history (citation needed)...

2102755,2,B0002KZXAU,"It is very good amateur playing, reasonable amateur recording and lousy filming and editing at best. If you are expecting and looking for professional performance and recording, you would be utterly disappointed, if not shocked!  The playing is not too bad, good for amateurs, but probably far too lousy for professional and experienced pianists.  There are much better performances in other recordings of the Chopin Etudes.

The pianist should dress properly and professionally for the recording, not half naked in a nightdress, with plastic necklace, heavy make-up and messy hair flying around, which constitute cheap presentation!

They should get professional cameramen experienced in shooting piano performances to do the filming.  The recording is filmed from odd angles and distances from the keyboard, never seen in other piano broadcasts and recordings, with rather frequent swinging of the camera and zooming-in-and-out over various parts of the keyboard as the player's hands move across the keyboard.  The editor should not constantly change the angle of the camera.  Both the cameramen and the editors should take beginners' lessons on how to film and edit piano performances.",1271116800,8,1189,5.5
2102756,5,B0002KZXAU,"Valentina Lisitsa here plays the 24 etudes of Frederic Chopin in a very distinctive manner. I checked the score and I am very satisfied. To listen this on high-end speakers is ultimately great. The Bsendorfer is a bass wonder. To record it is the ultimate challenge for recording equipment because the Bsendorfer is so rich and heavy in the lower frequency range.

I hope that this record of Valentina as a Bsendorfer reference will lead to a revival of Bsendorfer. Steinway is good as well but Bsendorfer is a bit more ! - Thie piano has heart and soul.

2102757,5,B0002KZXAU,"In an age that rewards athletes with millions of dollars per year for various bodily feats of derring-do and sometimes beauty, Valentina Lisitsa's video recording of the Chopin etudes is a bracing reminder of why art matters more and why in the largest scheme of things money matter less.
At least one great 20th-century pianist (Rubenstein) avoided for technical reasons recording the complete etudes. Nowadays it seems that every conservatory graduate has mastered all the finger-bending hurdles they contain. But, as has long been known, the Chopin etudes, no matter the extraordinary physical demands, are far more than advanced exercises. Witness the many stirring and insightful recordings available in the pages of Amazon.
Lisitsa's DVD stands alone, for several reasons, the most astonishing being that it was done in one take. One, I might add, technically flawless take. With the utter confidence of the master musician, she sits at the keyboard, starts, plays, finishes. (Can you imagine Gould ever allowing the release of one unedited take of the Goldberg Variations?)
Of course Lisitsa doesn't just start-play-finish. This is a performance for the ages. Whatever gasps our highly paid athletes draw from us with their hail-Mary passes, home runs, lay-ups, eagles, and drop shots, their physical mastery is only half the human story. Whatever those lovely arching bodies do, Lisitsa's fingers match--and then surpass as her mind and heart bring forth the passing miracle and mystery of music.
No cuts. No edits. For an unbroken hour she recreates, and welcomes the listener-viewer into, Chopin's paradise.
Notes:
1. This was a modest video production, involving only one camera. After the first--and complete--recording of all 24 etudes, Lisitsa played them them a second time to allow the camera to get shots from different angles. This added video was then edited into the original video take, while the audio track was left uninterrupted.
2. She's playing a magnificent 80-year-old Boesendorfer, which has its own unusual story, from Wigmore Hall (London) in the 1920s to a Yorkshire storage shed and finally to Miami, where the recording was made. The whole tale is told in the liner notes.",1266883200,6,2206,5.269886363636363

2102760,1,B0002KZXAU,"I do not usually post comments on Amazon but this recording compelled me to do so.
If you are expecting a high artistic standard, both in terms of performance and in terms of the recorded sound you will be sorely disappointed. The sound of the piano is not good ( what the point of view of the producers is can be gathered from the explanatory note included in the DVD's booklet : they recall listening to the piano for the first time ON THE PHONE (!) and deciding that it was a great find ). The recorded sound lacks clarity and detail and basically is like something recorded in somebody's basement. Very amateurish.
As to the interpretation it is devoid of any depth. The pianist plays either with tiring and cheap affectation or , in the fast passages, very ""straight"" and without nuance. She manages to get rid of any sense of polyphony even in those etudes which entirely rely on it , such as Op. 10 No. 3 or Op. 10 No. 6. The pedaling is not well thought out and in some pieces and places ( again Op. 10 No. 3 comes to mind) is actually quite appalling.
The DVD is advertised as an unedited recording, which is clearly not the case considering lack of synchronization between the audio and video. Even assuming that there was no splicing in the individual etudes they undoubtedly were played many times over. This is not a recording of a live performance. Having said that, the wrong notes and sloppiness of articulation in many places are simply inexcusable. To give an example, it is one thing for Martha Argerich to leave a wrong note in  her stupendous, passionate, white hot and justly famous studio recording of the Chopin Preludes for Deutsche Gramophone - when it is done for artistic reasons. It is quite another to leave imperfections in an otherwise uninspired performance, such as the one on this DVD. Then it is just sloppiness trying to pass for great art.
And this is my main problem with this DVD. If you decide to record a monumental work such as Chopin etudes, you better be ready to measure up to the great recordings of great pianists. Many famous artists of the past, such as Rubinstein and Horowitz showed much artistic humility by choosing not to record the complete Etudes.
This DVD is a ""B movie"" at best. It is the Thomas Kinkade of musical performance. Many people will be deceived. Many people will find the visual side of this production attractive. ( By the way , I do not. The negligee and the heavy lipstick are not appropriate or in good taste - and I am not a conservative person).
There is nothing wrong with somebody playing Chopin Etudes at a level of a graduate student. But let's be honest about it and call it what it is.",1247270400,22,2668,4.5010309278350515
2102761,5,B0002KZXAU,"Valentina Lisitsa is a true artist. She plays these etudes with power, with fire, and even a fine attention to detail in the delicate spots. The quality in every single one of these pieces is just outstanding. You will hear the melody line being brought out in every way, shape, and form.

At first, I thought I was just purchasing another one of the hundreds of recordings of Chopin Etudes that must be available on the market today. When I watched this DVD, within the first few measures of the outstanding Etude in C Major, you see the arpeggiations that Ms. Lisitsa so eloquently plays and you are hooked. Her technique and perfection at all of these incredible difficult passages seem so effortless you would think it's nothing to play these. You see so much personality in her playing, so much calmness, yet so much passion.

I find myself watching this DVD over and over again to try and soak in more and more of how this amazing performer plays Chopin. Not only are these recordings representative of the artist's original markings, but she takings them even further and plays beyond what you would expect. They're not just robotic interpretations, they have so much feeling.

Another great asset to this DVD is that she performs these on a legendary 1925 Bosendorfer Concert Grand, with a sound that is just unbelievable. The bass, the clarity, the beauty of this instrument makes these Etudes all the better.

My favorites from this set of Etudes are:

Op. 10, Nos. 3 - 5 (E, C#-, Gb, respectively) - so expressive, exciting, and fun!
Op. 10, No. 8, F - just awesome
Op. 10, No. 12 - The Revolutionary, with more melodic aspect than I've ever seen before

Op. 25, No. 9 - This fun little ""joke"" in Gb--she plays it so fervently and voices the melody and the bass in perfect synchronization
Op. 25, No. 11 & 12 - from the outstanding intensity of the A minor ""Winter Winds"" Etude to the out-of-this-world ""Oceans"" Etude, these last two are just fantastic.

I highly recommend this DVD of a truly phenomenal Ukrainian artist. She is extensively on tour these days so fetch the opportunity to see her! Enjoy.",1229731200,2,2115,4.654155495978553
2102762,5,B0002KZXAU,"By what criteria should one review and rate a music DVD? It surely shouldn't be by the quality of the performance alone, otherwise a CD recording of the music would suffice.  Having spent the better part of 30 years collecting LP then CD recordings of the classical repertoire, it's still quite a novelty to now be buying DVD's of the same works. It has taken me only 5 months to conclude that this is the best way to enjoy recorded music, and it was this DVD of Mrs Lisitsa playing Chopin's complete etudes which made me realise it.

There are many other ""studio"" (as opposed to ""concert"") video recordings of great works by great artists.  However, this one is the best I have seen.  Why?  Well, to start, the quality of the playing is musically very satisfying and technically flawless.  That, of course, is a minimium requirement of any recording these days.  What makes this video recording unique is that it has been conceived like no other.

Mrs Lisitsva plays at the piano as if for you alone.  The intimacy is created by the use of a totally dark backdrop, which lasts the entire recording. No matter which angle she is being viewed from, there is only her and the piano - no background distractions, so the focus is entirely on her and the music.

This is coupled with some of the finest footage of hands at a keyboard you are likely to see.  The cameraman is obviously familiar with the works, and anticipates their movement across the keyboard, enabling the camera to focus in very closely.  The lighting seems brighter than usual (probably because of the black backdrop), which together with the clarity of the digital recording, adds to the sense of immediacy.  It's as if you're standing over the keyboard watching.

The editing is also well thought through. There is a satisfying balance of close-ups (hands and face) and of the pianist at the keyboard, flowing seamlessly from one image to another, keeping it visually interesting throughout.

Finally, most (but not all) etudes within each opus group are played in succession without edit or interuption.  This creates a sense of their being presented as an organic whole, with each set comprised of richly varied and contrasting pieces.

Should you wish to sample before you buy, I suggest you go to Youtube and watch the Opus 25, number 12. Just superb.

DVD's such as this are a new direction for enjoying recorded music in one's own home.  It's as if the artist has been invited in to perform for you alone. I hope the mainstream labels pick up on the style, and follow it for everyone's  benefit.

2102764,5,B0002KZXAU,"Valentina Lisitsa is a young pianist from Ukraine who emigrated to the United States about 10 years ago. The first time I heard her playing, I was struck by her awesome and dazzling technique. I had never heard faster runs, arpeggios, and octaves, with precision that seemed supernatural. Valentina's recording of the Chopin Etudes is fabulous. Whenever I hear a rendition of the Etudes, I automatically compare it to my previous gold standard, which I consider to be Maurizio Pollini's Etudes cd from 1972. Valentina's playing matches Pollini in technique, as one would have expected. But there is also a depth of passion which makes these Etudes very special indeed. But what is really amazing is that this recording appears to have been made without a break or cut. She plays the entire set of Etudes straight through, one after the other, without any editing or retakes. Each Etude just flows off her fingers with ease, with power and ease. Unedited recordings are a trademark of Valentina's, but doing it with the complete Chopin Etudes seems that much more startling. The camera angles are very good, allowing the viewer to see her hands and fingers flying over the keyboard up close. I strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to have a special experience, to hear and see the Chopin Etudes played by a wonderful and dazzling pianist and musician, and, of course, to anyone who has ever tried to play these technically and musically challenging works. You will love it.",1187049600,5,1483,4.888888888888889
2102765,5,B0002KZXAU,"Valentina Lisitsa is in my view a comparatively undiscovered great pianist of our age. She has a growing - almost cult - following that can be seen on [...].

I have all three of her DVDs - the Chopin 24 Etudes, the Black and Pink, the 14 Schubert Songs transcribed by Liszt. I love the informality of these DVDs with their atmospheric lighting and camera takes (while the productions are excellent) but to discuss the etudes in particular, these recordings serve to illustrate Valentina's ability to immerse herself in the very soul of the composer no matter the origin or era. I agree with a review I found out there on the internet :
""Everybody plays the etudes, at least everybody who's ambitious. They are one of those hurdles that all serious piano students try to clear. Formidable (and often profound) as they are, they are still basically exercises which in an hour test just about every skill a human body needs to interact meaningfully with the infinite recalcitrancies of the object known as a piano. Some master the technical difficulties. Few go on to combine that mastery with release of the emotional depths contained in these deceptive little pieces.

The etudes have been recorded a million times (go to Amazon if you don't believe me), often--given the level of pianism in the world today--quite successfully.

I'm here to tell you that if Chopin matters to you and if serious piano-playing speaks to you, our Rapunzel, Ms. Valentina Lisitsa her own self, has given the world an audio-video rendering of these overplayed pieces that is, well, to die for.""",1175817600,7,1574,4.843866171003717
2102766,5,B0002KZXAU,"Everything is good in this DVD. The performance is excelent, the quality of image and sound too. Someone sad about a fail in synchronism between image and sound. In fact, I delay more than one year to buy it because of this information. BUT, I didn't experience anything like that. The DVD is perfect!

I desagree about ""bad"" interpretation. The performance is different in some cases, thats true. Some of the pieces are faster than, for example, Arrau. But, I think she have ""the right"" to perfom as she wants. She is a very serious artist and you can confirm this information going to her site. ([...])",1153267200,10,604,4.644859813084112
2102767,5,B0002KZXAU,"At the conclusion of a student piano recital at my home, serveral of us, including a piano teacher on the faculty at New York's Mannes School of Music, gathered to look at Lisitsa's DVD. We are experienced concertgoers and have heard a wide range of pianists from the histrionic Lang Lang to the sublime Richard Goode. We were mesmerized by Lisitsa.  Several of the students had played a few of the etudes and knew the difficulties of fingering and touch.  Early on, they commented repeatedly on this and that of Lisitsa's virtuoso technique, but as she moved through the Etudes, all became quiet.  The music she made silenced the room completely.  At the conclusion, I offered to play some sections at slow motion so they could better analyze Lisitsa's technique.  The group declined; her performance was too good to be spoiled by just technique.  If you are serious about playing the piano, this DVD is a must.",1148428800,19,912,4.777070063694268
2102768,3,B0002KZXAU,Piano has been a long term love of mine.  It simply will always be my first love.  Deep within that love are the Chopin Etudes Opus 10 and 25 which denote the pinacle of the art of technique and musicality.  This young pianist is the first to record for DVD the Chopin Etudes.  But readers please first listen to Perahia recent ride up the pyrrhic mountain and then compare to this young Russian pianist.  Her tone is rather flat throughout and not as expressive as should be.  Chopin utilizes the entire resilency of artist prowess in these masterpieces and playing most fast and somewhat loud does not bring them to heaven where they always belong.  Perahia shapes each with seperate character and presence that makes each stand out with singular profile while she doesn't achieve this same effect.  She is pehaps 30 and will need to grow more into their interpretation.  If I could I would play myself playing Opus 10 no1 and Opus 25 no11 do give you an idea how profound each of these pieces truely is.  She will be a very good performer but musicality is still most important which unfortunately I find still mildly lacking.  She simply needs more development.,1146009600,13,1165,4.661764705882353
2102769,5,B0002KZXAU,"I took a shot at this one based on the Amazon consumer reviews. I have a problem with the delay between sound and visual -which could leave one with the impression that the sound was dubbed. The velocity and dynamics are so wild - almost demonic -kind of like Horowitz on speed -that it was hard to believe it was coming from such a delicate looking creature, until I checked out her web site and viewed the numerous generously long samples of super virtuostic repetoire on her site.  I think shes the real thing. Scary stuff!!  Definitly worth a buy.",1142467200,9,551,4.5
2102770,5,B0002KZXAU,"Beutifull technic, young and mature pianist full of talent; for my taste in some litle pasages the camara changes point of view  giving the impression that needs to improve musicality and syncs; but, it is Outstanding any way.",1140134400,,226,4.947368421052632

2102773,5,B0002KZXAU,"Five EBULLIENT Stars!! Valentina Lisitsa is one of the most heralded stars among the current generation of classical pianists and the DVD ""Chopin 24 Etudes For Piano Op. 10 and Op. 25"" is an excellent introduction. It's also a pleasure to ""see"" Ms Lisitsa playing, displaying her awesome technique and her tremendous right hand. The DVD is a graphic visual demonstration of how artfully different her fingering technique is on some works. Forget the controversy, this woman can 'scorch' with the best of them. And Chopin etudes are an excellent choice with which she can display her command of nuances as well as her keyboard fireworks, all while displaying little facial emotion. Total concentration. Fire and ice!!

My best of the best, Pieces D'Resistance, are the beautiful 10/1 with it's awesome arpeggios, the challenging fingerings of 10/2 (an apparent direct antecedent of the future ""Flight of the Bumblebee""), 10/3 (""Tristesse"") which Chopin felt was his most beautiful melody, the raging flames of 10/4, and the resounding echos built into 10/5: ""the Black Keys Etude"". Add to that, the stunning performances of 25/1 (""Shepherd Boy""), 25/2 (""Bees""), the grace notes of 25/5 (""Butterfly"") which has been a huge influence on jazz pianists, 25/6, the howling gales of ""Winter Wind"" (25/11) and ""Ocean"" (25/12), and you have a wonderful compendium of Chopin etude performances, visually and aurally. It's interesting to note that these etudes were the first true seriously taken stand-alone pieces of their type and were dedicated to Franz Liszt (Op. 10) and Countess d'Agoult (Op 25). Chopin was in his mid-20's and already a certified and somewhat iconoclastic musical genius.

(NOTE: Truth be told, however, Ms Lisitsa's stunning good looks and her blue silk dress, cut to demand attention, occasionally threaten to upend her pianism with 'eye candy' shown from multiple camera angles. She could be dressed in a potato sack and we would notice her statuesque nordic-like beauty. But this can't be helped; this about the MUSIC. A few times, I got up and walked over to the speakers to just listen to her magnificent pianism, in and of itself: She's a great pianist!)

Five MAGNIFICENT Stars for her pianistic reading of Chopin, for the excellent sound recording, for the cinematography, and yes, the dress designer. LOL.",1117238400,53,2329,5.156084656084656
2102774,3,B0002KZXAU,"Both video and audio quality of this DVD are very good.  The editing spoils the show a bit for us pianists.  Lots of camera angles and lots of time spent away from the keyboard.  During the whole ""arpeggios"" etude you don't see her hands at all.  Makes you wonder if there was some kind of problem.

There is no printed enclosure to tell you about the pianist or the recording.",1111190400,19,377,4.328571428571428

8028727,5,B0002KZXAU,I bought this as soon as I found it on Amazon after watching Valentina play numerous works on you-tube and being enthralled by her virtuosity and obvious feeling for the music as the composer likely felt it .  This empathy with the composers makes Valentina Lisitsa unique among pianists and instills her playing with a magical beauty which is further enhanced by her kindly and friendly manner and her own beauty.  To watch her playing transports one above the bleakness that often pervades daily life these days and makes her recordings rare gifts to be savored.  I also have her CD of the Chopin and Shumann Etudes and this has the extra thrill of seeing her play as well as  hearing the music.,1429488000,2,697,4.642276422764228

8028731,5,B0002KZXAU,"Watch all the masters play these etudes. (i.e. on YouTube) I enjoy Lisitsa's playing/interpretations of these Etudes far more. But most of all - I enjoy the sound of the piano. It is by far the best performance and sound of any piano recording I've heard of these Etudes. I imagine this is partly due (aside from using an amazing piano) to it being a 24 bit recording. (Audio on a DVD.) The disc is layed out very intuitively - to allow one an easily obtained high degree of familiarity with the pieces. Plus, she looks very beautiful. Congratulations Valentina on such an extraordinary achievement.",1333497600,5,599,4.714285714285714
8028732,5,B0002KZXAU,"This video can only be highly recommended, especially when having detailed experience - or even practice - with the piano. Where else do you get the chance of being close witness to the artist,looking over her shoulder and watching her hands, nearly controlling her fingering! And this in sufficiently long takes, intermixed with decently portraying Valentina's concentrated face. And all the while you keep deeply impressed by her genuine interpretation of Chopins music, counting to the best he has written.
This DVD should also be offered in the German catalogue of amazon.de !
