8750291,3,B01BIDBI76,"This movie has aged badly. Despite the strong visuals from powerful Italian director Mario Caiano able to create intriguing and terrifying atmospheres, in Italy 1971 circa, and with a small budget, and, despite a strong cast, headed by Rosemary Dexter real trying hard to make of her lead character a psychological, more believable and alluring lady than what she ends up being, and with the always reliable Alida Valli, splendid as the villain, Adolfo Celi always playing with gusto what could be called 'ambiguity', a young and lovely Sybil Danning, already outlining her cold, bitchy character lines to become quite well known a decade later,  and even, the young studs Benjamin Lev and playboy Gigi Rizzi, among others, this terrific restoration from the original vaults of the movie, is never less than trippy and at times a fun to watch and well executed, shocking Giallo of cult genre, and, that many 'fans'  will enjoy with pleasure, even today. However, again, some of the main, and key plot's  premises are too trite, and, possibly even way triter today to make of this a real classic cult film, despite its harrowing and hypnotic visuals, and good Italian location work, with a consistent sinister suspense.",1466640000,,1218,5.01980198019802

8750293,4,B01BIDBI76,"Code Red has excavated an odd, surrealistic psycho thriller from Europe's Golden age.  Director Mario Caiano's 'EYE IN THE LABYRINTH' aka 'L'OCCHIO NEL LABIRINTO'  -1972  was never given a proper release in this country thereby having its reputation lost in the shuffle to this day until now.  This strange photoplay of a woman's friends disappearance is peppered with eccentric red herring characters acting illogically as Director Caiano builds his atmosphere but never really involves the audience due to its irrational set pieces.  Caiano dipped into many genres mainly Sword and Sandal and Westerns but is mainly known for his colloboration with cult actress Barbara Steele,1965's 'NIGHTMARE CASTLE' aka 'AMANTI D'OLTRETUMBA'. This film is better suited for repeated viewings as the plot's puzzles reveal more and more with each unveiling and the erratic behavior of the characters makes more sense but to give away more of the story would diminish the films impact.  It is aided with excellent photography by Giovanni Carlo to give its images a maze like feel for it's heroine's plight.  The jazzy score by Roberto Nicolosi seems out of place at first but begins to work well towards the films surprising climax.  Rosemary Dexter is excellent as our leading lady aided by a great supporting cast in Adolfo Celi, Franco Ressel, Horst Frank, the great Alida Valli and a very young Sybil Danning.  Code Red releases the Blu-Ray in a nice, crisp transfer in its original 1.78 ratio with an English dubbed soundtrack.  It is not a Giallo per se but deserves a better reputation in the psycho thriller genre.  This release has no extras but may be a limited edition thereby having its price a little on the steep side.",1463788800,3,1718,5.014084507042254
