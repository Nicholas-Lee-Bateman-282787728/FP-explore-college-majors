4860413,5,B005QW98IW,"This is an excellent documentary on much of the current theory in astro-physics.  It is aimed at the general public.  Complex theories are explained well and there are excellent visuals to support the explanations.  As a 5th grade teacher, I'm seriously considering using this as a teaching tool in my classroom to help my students better understand astronomy.

He is a true artist because he is able to demonstrate and clearly explain the basics physics. In this scientific film, composed of three series, Professor Hawking invites us to go into the Universe. Together, we will make a dangerous and exciting journey into a Black Hole and find out why she is able to slow down time. While watching this film, I was very pleased with the fact that Professor Hawking touches on the theme of flight in the future. I personally learned many new and interesting things, as well as to enhance their knowledge about subatomic and quarks. And it's all thanks to the outstanding scientist Stephen Hawking!

4860492,4,B005QW98IW,"People love stories and fairytales, thats the reason they also call Hawking the worlds most famous living scientist although hawking is not a real scientist, Real scientists like Tesla could demonstrate their science with testable experiments.
Thats what I call science. Science isn't sitting in a vacuum theorizing about hypothetical stories of how the universe could have been created. Science and scientists should stick to their guns and work within the perimeters of testable science.
It seems to me that most people are under the false impression of what constitutes science, including Dr Hawking. He is also under the wrong impression of metaphysics [spirituality] and philosophy. He writes a philosophical book on philosophy concerning his assumption of there not being a God and then openly declares philosophy to be dead. The average couch potato or non scientist, evolutionist or atheist has bought into Hawking lies. They cant care less about what is really objectively true or not, they are to busy playing with mathematical formulas on the event horizon. Soon every atheist will be sucked into the black hole [hell] from which there is no escape. Good graphics and fascinating Hollywood movies might fascinate the gullible, but never the true Christian or true scientist who has escaped the black hole through Jesus Christ, the only True God and savior of mankind. What makes Hawking the most fascinating storyteller on the block might also have something to do with his miraculous life and his unfortunate condition. Jesus Christ has blessed this highly intelligent though god rejecting individual with such longevity which is a miracle in itself. Its just a pity that his caught up in the creation instead of the creator.
Mathematical formulas can never give one the meaning to this one AND ONLY universe. The meaning is wrapped up in the creator and you have one life to find God or avoid God before you enter eternity. Theorizing has its place, but then one must see it for what it is; only theories or speculations. I go with Gods book, the King James Bible and a literal 6 day creation 6 thousand years ago which true observational data supports. True science must fulfill the ministerial use in life; it must not set itself up as a false god or idol pretending it has all the right answers to life, or even worse, try to supplant God!",1395014400,,2355,4.94949494949495

I used this material as backup for my book on the historical separation between Science and Religion; that I wrote as a guide for today's righteous Fundamental religious Extremists' to, once and for all,  rationally reconcile their steadfast faith in Scripture with modern science.  Especially the treatment of the so-called Big Bang's creation of the universe and supernovae, which are both prophetically already mentioned in the book of Genesis; vis--vis how the universe and Adam were first created from nothing and the dust of the Earth respectively.",1378684800,,825,5.584

It is full of gee-whiz ideas and Mr. Hawking's guesses at what possible form that life elsewhere in the universe could take. But he didn't go very deep at all.

The Computer Generated Imagery was fantastic, though. On the other hand, there very little knowledge or information contained there.

4860526,5,B005QW98IW,"Seen many educational DVDs lately?  If you like learning and getting  entertainment value at the same time, this should be your choice.  Great for children and adults, this movie(s) provides great computer images and easy to understand narration. [This narrator has the best diction ever, and I don't mean Mr. Hawking's computer generated voice!]. If you want to understand the universe and how we came to ""be"", don't miss this.",1350172800,,428,5.085714285714285
4860527,5,B005QW98IW,"The narrator of this series is Stephen Hawking, one of the leading scientific minds of the day, whose voice morphs back and forth between his familiar computer-generated sound and the voice of an actor speaking the lines.  For me, perhaps the most memorable highlight was the introduction to each of the three episodes on the disc. As he sits crumpled in his wheelchair, Hawking's computer voice says ""Hello. My name is Stephen Hawking, physicist, cosmologist and something of a dreamer. Although I cannot move, and have to speak through a computer, in my mind I am free...""  When any member of my family wandered innocently through the living room, I had them listen to the introduction.

Produced by Discovery Channel, the video quality of the Blu-ray is wonderful, with computer graphics that look like photographs from the Hubble telescope except that they are in motion. The three episodes are: ""Aliens"" and ""Time Travel"" which are about 50 minutes each; and ""The Story of Everything"" which runs almost 90 minutes. Aliens consists of conjecture about the likely existence of extraterrestrial life and what possible forms such life might take. Time Travel discusses ""worm holes"" and orbiting a large mass such as a black hole as possible ways to travel in time. Ultimately these are dismissed as unlikely, and Einstein's theory of time slowing down as one approaches the speed of light is deemed to be the best hope for time travel.

The Story of Everything is the real mother lode of information, and perhaps was saved for last in order to prepare the audience by starting with the shorter episodes and the trendier topics. It is the story of the universe, how it began, how it developed into what we see today, and what fate is thought to lie in store for it.  The narration is remarkable, threading a fine line between cutting-edge physics and cosmology on the one hand, and providing information in a manner that is palatable and understandable to the intelligent layman on the other.

Watch and listen, and have unimaginable vistas open up before you.  Steven Hawking cannot move, but he will move you.",1349481600,7,2111,4.896358543417367

The dvd did not disappoint with its outstanding picture quality and with some new ideas about life beyond our Solar System that Professor Hawking offered, some of it though seemed far fetched even to me.

If PBS's <Hunting the Edge of Space> makes one aware of the world we live in, this documentary (esp. the third part) brings us the knowledge of how transient life, the Earth, and the entire universe are, and how inadequate modern technology is. I was sitting in my garden feeling invincible, content with the modern conveniences and gadgets, totally oblivious of the coincidences that made life happen, and the fiery fate awaiting humanity. Not anymore. Watching the lifeless Earth being swallowed by the sun is incredibly sad. The future is not Star Trek.

Well-made documentary. The narrator Benedict Cumberbatch is simply fantastic.",1348358400,,651,5.25

Most reviewers have already given great info on the content and I can only agree with them. Strangely, after having been re-watching 'sliders' for the last few days, this dvd seems almost complementing the concept of this series about wormholes. I know it's speculation.

I -LOVE- space/universe shows, and I figured that this would be an interesting choice, seeing as how I always liked Stephen Hawking.  IT WAS AWESOME!  The way they shift from Stephen in real life to what is portrayed as the voice in his mind is very clever and feels like he is truly speaking.  He then goes on to explain very complex thoughts into very understandable terms that non-scientists can understand.  I am no scientist, but I was able to comprehend and fully undestand what Stephen was talking about.  The time-travel episode was my favorite, and to hear what he says on the subject was fascinating!  This whole DVD was very intriguing and a well thought out format.
Bottom Line:  If you like space/universe shows, and want to feel as if one of the leading minds in Science is teaching you about it directly, give this DVD a shot!  For the price, you cannot go wrong!",1344556800,,933,4.606060606060606

Stephen Hawking's voice is played by Stephen and a British actor named Benedict Cumberbatch, better known by the title role in Sherlock, the Masterpiece Mystery modern series about the odd detective.

The science is crazy interesting and I watched all of them in one night on the Discovery Channel.",1344297600,,501,4.758620689655173
4860535,5,B005QW98IW,"I'm fascinated by our Universe and all the wonders contained in it, so this disc is a must-have for me. The fact that it is (partially) narrated by one of greatest minds of all times, Mr. Hawking is a pure bonus! When I say partially, (SPOILER!) I mean that Mr. Hawking starts talking and then another narrator takes over, usually mid-sentence. I guess producers thought that his somewhat robotic voice will annoy people. I myself don't care, I wouldn't mind listening to him but either way works.

This disc is full of interesting things and is very well presented. Material is fairly new, with some newer theories understandably absent but still since most of them are still being developed I don't mind that either. While I try to follow new discoveries regularly even I found some info quite new to me, so I'm even more happy now for buying this item.

Graphics is amazing - you simply MUST watch this on a FullHD TV 40"" or bigger! Not all animations are state-of-the-art but they're pretty well done and easy to understand.

In conclusion, I do recommend this inexpensive item to everyone who likes to explore mysteries of the Universe. I find it well done and quite educational, with abundance of useful information that will blow your mind - at least until new theories replace ones contained herein! :)

And Mr. Hawking, while in a poor state of health, proves that he's still one of greatest minds of all times and I wish him well and send my greatest thanks for his efforts to share his wonderful mind with us!",1342137600,3,1520,4.639405204460966

4860538,2,B005QW98IW,"I finally got to see some of this series on the tube while channel-surfing, after hearing about it for soooo long. That is, hearing about it ad nauseum from reactionaries who tsk-tsk about it in the most over-the-top fashion. Strangely, though the part that I caught seemed strangely cut from the same cloth as a reactionary series as Padre Baron's catholicism series. And here's why. For starters there is the very strange videographic trope of trying to make the viewer feel insignificant in every way. This is a surpassingly odd prima facie and de facto goal in a series that is premised on the notion of a the human mind's great ability to grasp cosmic matters with one of the great achievements of the modern age, science. But there the trope is, in the most blatant fashion, with human life portrayed relentlessly like ants scurrying around. Pray tell, if we are trying to discern what life is really about on the planet realistically in relation to the vastness of the universe, when do we ever see locomotion sped up like a cartoon of the Road Runner, but with masses of people doing the running? Not very subtle intent, cinemato-psychologically, I aver. Then there is really very odd way they portrayed Hawking. Apparently the man is a respected teacher or physics sage. So why not portray him interacting in some way. No, they have him in a big old room witting alone, very preposterously. Where are those around that make his life meaningful, and help him physically. No, instead they portray him there sitting like a Cartesian cogito all alone, and it is hilarious, Now I do NOT want to be thought of as mean, and laughing at the physically challenged, but it seems to me the way they did portray him is doing that in the most egregious form already. The lighting and odd angles on the guy seems entirely concocted to make him look like the utter evocation of the Ghost in the Machine. One is almost not surprised to find in the next scene the utter confirmation of this, in an historical digression on Descartes,  (And a rather handsome Descartes too, which he was not by his pictures.)

But it gets worse. Then Hawking opines that ""philosophy is dead"" Oy vey, how many times have we heard that?! Again?? But the reason why is really sooo outre that it is one for the record books. Look, I barely could handle Algebra II in  Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame Catholic High School with Miss Acevedo, so I read carefully here, and with deference to the man's extraordinarily brilliant mind. But being alive and not a slouch in my own field -- which touches on philosophy -- I have room to comment. Switching again from exploding galaxies to Hawking sitting alone in a Cambridge classroom like his nurse forgot to come pick him up after class (does this bizarre chose  portrayal  of him by the producers of this DVD not reek of a certain cruelty, truly?!) his computerized voice gives the money shot. Before the Big Bang there was not time. Thus there no time for God to have been in prior to the creation of time, and so no God at all possible generally. Is this very well educated man not aware that the entire history of Buddhist thought is bound up with notions of void. And that this did not preclude elements of conceiving God in some historical parts of Buddhist thought? Maybe he doesn't agree with it. But it is not as if the science has destroyed the possibilities of such meanings. Further, even in the West, amongst those thinkers or mystics of more ""apophatic"" tendency there is a way of conceiving God that is not at all precluded by the science presented by Hawking. Poor Meister Eckhart, great thinker that he was. After dealing with the Inquisition even, his memory is not respectged in Western Culture, even at Cambridge apparently, to have his notion of ""Nichts"" somehow factored in.

Somehow the extremes seem to meet here, with an effort like Robert Barron's Catholicism series, which also makes people look small. Both truncate the vastness of human religious questioning. I am not bothered personally by atheism, and don't see it as very challenging to the ultimate dimension of the religious instinct. But I am am bothered by propaganda. That's what this is.",1339286400,9,4187,4.705320600272851

That given however, this is a great DVD to have around the house. I don't know about you, but for me, the whole debate about alien life is not even an issue anymore.  Statistics alone would indicate the reality.  Mr. H's chapter on alien life presents some intriguing ideas and good visuals/animations about it (and let's be honest, it's the 'crew' and their work that make or break these films, not the ""star/singer/celebrity"" standing in front.); which only reinforce my opinion that it's not if, but only when we confirm intelligent alien life.

Hawking and the team illustrate all sorts of physics and astronomy concepts. There is a section on the beginning of the universe, on alien life, time travel. He explains a great deal, including several quantum mechanics concepts and also including topics that have not been seen a thousand times on other media.

They use anologies, not technical jargon, to illustrate complex concepts..... and in ways that are creative and suprisingly correct (basically anyway).

The DVD was meant for the 'average' person and is highly educational, but will not go over your head.

This video was so fun and amazing. I seen in on TV and decided to purchase it. He goes through everything from how life started, to the existance of aliens, time travel and how everything in the world works. He covers what the world will be like and look like billions of years from now. It is so cool to learn from him. He makes this stuff very easy to understand with amazing examples. He does an EXCELLENT job at dumbing the information down so that we can understand it.

If you haven't seen this video you know NOTHING about how the world works. This is a ""need to watch"" for everyone, even if you aren't interested in aliens or time travel, because it will give you the knowledge to understand how the world works.

Dr. Hawking if you're reading this.. you are AMAZING. I can't believe all the good things you've done with your life, even with your issues of being completely unable to move, and confined to a wheel chair. I've always looked up to everything you do.

All three episodes (Aliens, Time Travel and Everything Else) were magnificent and gave me the very best starting point for understanding the ""un-understandable"" about our own Universe (and perhaps others) that combined interesting logical ideas, mathematics (but not so as to distract the non-mathematician) and absolutely gorgeous visual effects in a single package.

But given his way of describing things and his disabilities that do not seem to hold him back much, I'd say he's very important in his field.

I laughed very much watching modified elephant with trunk size of half its body sucking some slug from stones of obliviously dead desert. You don't have to be a scientist to tell that this kind of life won't last a week. And again why is scientists so sure that without hydrogen won't be no life? It won't be life like ours but self-reproduction could be in a different environment and thus life forms. Mr Hawking does not give any calculations or solid evidence of time traveling. Instead he says: ""I do not say it could be done (making a wormhole) but if it would... what a wonderful opportunity we have"" then pure fantasy speculations take a place. There is theory (and it in this movie) that mass object were created by dislocation in some kind of perfect matrix of equal particles on equal distance. They (theorists) ""take"" away 5 particles and then say that all structure will be shifted away from this empty spot by gravity forming dense matter. What an imagination!!! They imagined absolute ideal conditions excluding other forces of interaction ""somehow"" making disappear those particles. Wow! The gravity is a weak force in small scales thus if electrical field existed then that what would took an initiative in such a model. Otherwise if they imagine gas then it would be spreaded  equally (nothing would be changed). But most funny conclusion was made after this theory that: ""...we all exist because of Universe imperfection..."". NO dear Stephen, imperfection did not let you live your life in full (no offenses). Imperfection is a key to destruction. It breaks a program - not create. A symmetry and order can't be born out of chaos without selective forces applied in programmed sequences to any sort of  matter.
 As for Doppler effect. It shows that galaxies move away from some center BUT it is absolutely not necessary that some blast happened milliards years ago. (Blast would not create and keep creating new galaxies - try to build aircraft by blasting aircraft plant and see what will happen). Using Doppler effect could also mean that galaxies filling up layers like electrons around an atom but on spiral trajectory directed away from Center. As for theory of relativity, people take it on fate not understanding a part of it. To understand this you need understand what time is. What you thinking first of all when you say time? - The watch. What is the watch - mechanism iterating cycles. For what purpose? - To organize your life. Why? - Because it ends one day and you may want to achieve something. How do you know how long do you have? - By watching day-nights changing, by seasons changing. But we needed more accurate scale to measure day making plans. So a watch was invented. To do what (from human body aspect)? - To scale processes duration. And What is any process? - Is a MOTION. Try to imagine that there are no motions of anything at all... What would you measure and even how? So the Time is a scoop of movements in different directions of all things what have a mass (in any form) with a constant reference system taken for basis so you could measure its quantity. It does not matter what speed you fly with if you take the same constant reference system to calculate from. 4 years for astronaut will be same as four years on Earth. He'll just cover a great distance for very short time unless if you gonna suggest that his biological process somehow will slow down. Speed of light will disintegrate particles and this what you will end up with. If we assume that you could to disintegrate particles and ""somehow"" put them back in absolutely same structure then for this structure time did not exist ('cause matter would not exist) during photons traveling (which would hold the information of that structure) from time of disintegrating to recreating it back. Then yes all processes of disintegrated matter would stop but you won't be able to count time for stopped process (only time of light traveling) and thus this matter won't become any older if you ""freeze"" it. Then no matter how much time will pass on Earth for ""matter"" traveling with light speed disintegrated in photons time not gonna change a bit. But this is another story and theory of relativity has nothing to do with that. There is absolutely stupid example referring to theory of relativity like speeding car passing you by at the very high speed and for its driver you are not moving at all even if you did. How and why is that human eye imperfections fit in theory of relativity? Take a fast camera with high resolution and you'll see all subject movements in the speed (after editing) suitable for your eyes. Another example in this movie like circling train around Earth with light speed and then comes Narrator's question: will speed of passenger inside the train be added to a speed of light if he'll start moving forward the train direction? - He answers: No. Well in that case passenger's speed will be equal zero and it won't be able to move. Where is a mistake? Same as I described above. Nothing but photons travels faster with light speed, so you'd have to disintegrate matter in photons and in that case no stream of photons (passenger) will go faster another of photons' stream (train). This example in the movie is absurd. You can't simply project one physics laws in different conditions.
In two words. Theories in this movie is outdated and there is a lot of guesses and fantasies.
I'd recommend to buy ""Universe"" season 3 instead. There are lots of more opinions and observations there.
As for Stephen, he achieved a lot but for me, if I'd have a choice among of opinions in physics, it would be just not enough.",1297814400,12,5804,4.710629921259843
4860561,5,B005QW98IW,"This is excellent series of three episodes by Hawking on his analysis and conclusions about the universe - aliens, time travel, and the development of the universe.  His style is not flamboyant; the visuals try to make up for this but are repetitive in some instances.

However, his logical approach to these topics, analysis of current research and thought, and his own opinions and comments make this series well worth viewing a number of times.",1296259200,47,447,4.946666666666666
4860562,4,B005QW98IW,"This is a fantastic mini-series from one of the brightest minds of our time.  It invokes a lot of interesting thoughts concerning where science and technology may take us in the future.  Somewhat sobering to realize what has happened to Stephen Hawking throughout his life and yet he still has a fantastic outlook on life.

Hopefully this series will be used in science classes throughout the globe rather than the old film strips I endured as a child.  It serves as a great jump off point for further learning, creating a real passion for learning more about the subject matter presented.

This mini-series consists of 3 segments:
Aliens:
This segment takes an interesting look at whether life might exist outside of our planet and what forms it would take.  It has a well reasoned approach to theorizing if life could potentially exist elsewhere.  The most intriguing part is actually trying to imagine life that doesn't need to resemble anything we are currently familiar with.  The segment is made all the more amazing after the recent discovery of life in a pool of arsenic.

Time Travel:
This is also fairly interesting in the way that Hawking presents his arguments for Time Travel and the possible uses we might make of the ability to do so.  I don't want to say too much as it would give away his interesting take on the subject matter.  Not necessarily what you might expect to hear from a scientist.

Everything:
This is the largest portion of the mini-series and by far the most interesting as Hawking explains what is essentially his expertise.  He explains the effects of gravity on the formation of everything and how it all might someday end.  He also takes a peek at the potential for our species to further ourselves and extend our existence beyond that of our humble Earth.",1295654400,123,1792,4.757281553398058
4860563,4,B005QW98IW,"I've only seen the story of everything episode, myself, which I thought was actually amazing. Very informative and interesting and genius without being too complicated (for those without a science background). I thought it was eye-opening. I got this dvd for my dad and they started out with the aliens episode which, according to them, wasn't so great. Their complaint was that the dvd seemed to make up alien creatures and it was founded on nothing. They thought that anybody could make up whatever they wanted about aliens. This won't deter me from watching that episode in the future. Of course the aliens in the dvd were founded on nothing since there's no available evidence to go on.",1294012800,,690,4.8559322033898304
