8565760,4,B0000AKMZP,"Don't get me wrong.  I like wall to wall mayhem, and that's not Director's Cut.  But this Killer Comedy is better than any reality TV show on TV.  Of course, it isn't reality TV, but then neither is reality TV, know what I mean?... This is better.  Way better.  Funny, original, perverse.  Instead of Survivor, I recommend Director's Cut!",1082592000,3,338,4.6440677966101696
8565761,5,B0000AKMZP,"This is one of the most refreshing pieces of low budget horror I've seen. It was slick well cut and bloody, with a good plot to help it along too. This is the direction horror films should be taking. Nothing like praying on a fear of missused power tools to make this type of film great.
This is one flick that you can't go without in your horror collection.",1082592000,2,358,4.202898550724638
8565762,5,B0000AKMZP,"Director's Cut is the new kind of horror, fast, bloody and unrelenting. This film isn't just a bunch of good looking faces getting killed (which is enough), it also has a cool plot and odd characters.  The box cover doesn't give this movie justice.  If you like horror you will want to know this movie because it will come up in conversation.",1059004800,2,342,4.5
