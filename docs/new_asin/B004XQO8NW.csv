4497115,5,B004XQO8NW,"I'd heard less than raving reviews of this movie, but I bought it, nonetheless, and found it to be rather enjoyable! Sure, the acting isn't top-notch, and the plot is far-fetched and campy, but for Herman's Hermits fans, it's a definite must! From a fan's perspective, it's endearing and fun and full of fab familiar tunes. Bonus points for Herbert Anderson; what a babe.",1363564800,3,371,4.8125
4497116,5,B004XQO8NW,"This movie really took me back to a great time in my life, and I used to ""Love"" Herman's Hermits.  I remember being riveted to this movie as a child.  As movies go, this one was never much of an ""Oscar"" contender, but it brought back wonderful memories for me.  Glad I found this, and the quality was quite good.",1362960000,4,312,4.166666666666667
4497117,4,B004XQO8NW,"Finally glad to see this movie available on DVD.

Shot in various places in Los Angeles, including Ontario Airport (tarmac and interior of airport scenes), Fairmont Miramar Hotel in Santa Monica, Pacific Ocean Park (POP) in Santa Monica which used to be along Ocean Park Blvd., Pacific Cove Beach in Malibu (the dream sequence with Herman & Louisa), and the Rose Bowl.  Only the country club scene where the charity concert was played I'm not sure about.  The amusement park scene at POP is the most fascinating, because no obvious remains of that park exists in Santa Monica today - it was completely torn down (this is NOT the Santa Monica Pier amusement park that we see on the pier today, as I thought when I first watched this movie).

Bernard Fox who plays the manager, is best known as the physician Dr. Bombay in the 1960's TV series Bewtitched.

The musical soundtrack was recorded in Los Angeles and the Hermits played on all the songs they perform here (one great thing about the movie!), less subject to the controls of Micky Most, who was an ocean away.  P.F. Sloan wrote the title song and the hit single ""A Must To Avoid"", along with ""Where Were You When I Needed You"", which not long after became a hit for the Grass Roots later in 1966.",1362182400,4,1253,4.546666666666667
4497118,3,B004XQO8NW,"If you are reviewing this dvd strickly as a movie than you would
have to agree that its rather poor. It makes HELP! look like Shakespear.
However......if you take into account that its Herman's Hermits and
the nostaglia of it, than its a pretty good buy. I didn't get to see this
movie back in the 60's and was very curious about it.  Its fun in a
Don Knotts/Brady Bunch kind of way. I am glad I bought it.",1355702400,4,406,4.139240506329114
4497119,3,B004XQO8NW,"This film seems to be a quickie made to cash in the `British Pop Invasion'.

Harmless fun but not up to the quality of  Hard days Night' or `Help'.  Songs are far better than the story but as a souvenir of this era it is worth adding to your library.

The film is in 2.35:1 (correct format) not 1.77:1 in your product description.

Transfer is very good and trailer is included.",1334966400,3,378,4.267605633802817
4497120,2,B004XQO8NW,"About a dozen years ago PBS broadcast a British Invasion reunion special from some dreary hotel-casino in who-knows-where.  Highlights included Eric Burdon without the Animals and the Foundations.  It was Peter Noone going solo who brought down the house with a spine tingling rendition of ""There's a Kind of a Hush"".  What does all this have to with ""Hold On!"" you may ask?  Nothing but I thought I'd say something nice before I slammed this turkey.  Noone and his mates are amicable geezers but that can't save this stink bomb.  The story is pure bubble gum.  It's as though it was written in crayon.  The songs are mediocre save ""Leaning on a Lamp Post"".  It's as though the film was shot quickly and haphazardly designed to cash in on the band's popularity before they fell out of favor.  It should come as no surprise that this enterprise was produced by Sam Katzman, teen exploitation extraordinaire.  Oh, well.  Better luck next time, boys.",1333238400,4,947,4.777777777777778
4497121,3,B004XQO8NW,"If you're looking for a Herman's Hermits version of A Hard Day's Night here, ""Hold On,"" this movie isn't it. The biggest obstacle to that is because the other band members of Herman's Hermits, Karl Green, Keith Hopwood, Derek Leckenby, and Barry Whitwam are underused in the film. The band plays some tunes, but their speaking parts are sadly kept to a minimum. The focus is on Peter Noone as ""Herman"".

Now, if you're a fan of Sixties Hollywood -- or Bollywood and Elvis Movies -- you'll enjoy this movie. The script is pretty basic and contrived, but the cast and crew carry it off. The film is what it is: a Hollywood attempt to exploit the popularity of Herman's Hermits by using good local talent to craft a film.

The first Hollywood face you'll recognize is Herbert Anderson from Dennis the Menace. He's the harried scientist who is forced to investigate Herman's Hermits. I won't go into plot details but as the movie unfolds the story begins to seem vaguely familiar. When Sue Ann Langdon and Shelley Fabares appear on screen the mood is pretty much set. Although Elvis doesn't show up, this has all the earmarks of an Elvis movie. With a little bit of Bye Bye, Birdie thrown in. Sam Katzman produced Hold On, as well as a number of Elvis movies back in the 1960's. The director, Arthur Lubin, although not a household name, is the man behind the talking horse, Mr Ed. His film before this, The Incredible Mr Limpet, has always been a favorite of mine.

I enjoyed this movie. Peter Noone has a likable screen presence, but I just wish the band had more screen time. The stock Hollywood characters make this film feel as comfortable as an episode of The Beverly Hillbillies. The Elvis girls were a treat: Sue Ane Langdon is a great comic beauty, and Shelley Fabares brings that special something that has graced every production from The Donna Reed Show to Coach.

It's good to see this has made it to DVD.",1313798400,18,1914,4.571428571428571
4497122,5,B004XQO8NW,"Although this isn't a perfect movie by far! If you enjoy the british invasion music from the 60's and into a little nostalgia,it was really fun to watch. I particularily enjoyed their song""I'm Leaning on a Lamp post"" done on a space capsule! The only other movie Herman's Hermits starred in was the 1968 film,""Mrs. Brown you've got a lovely daughter' which I think had more character considering that it was filmed in Manchester where they were from plus it also starred the reknowned Stanley Holloway. I also wish that another 60's british invasion movie""Ferry cross the the Mersey"" starring Gerry and the Pacemakers would be released. That would be great!!",1309996800,6,658,4.936936936936937
4497143,1,B004XQO8NW,I thought that the movie was probably better in the '60's but in 2016 it did not appeal to me.  I liked the music and a few of the jokes were cute.,1457827200,,147,3.59375

4497145,3,B004XQO8NW,"Really the only thing good about this movie is the music, which gets five stars. The movie has a ""let's cash in on this British invasion thing quick before it fades"". The movie is around the level of the Elvis film Harem Scarum, a stinking suppository of a movie. You certainly won't want to watch this more than once. If it was SciFy it would have a candidate for the Mystery Science Theater treatment. You would be far better served by watching Mrs Brown You've got a Lovely Daughter, Herman's Hermits other starring movie which is actually pretty good.",1434931200,,555,4.616161616161616

I will watch it again and again. I am not one who watches a dvd and complains about the quality of it, I just want to see old movies. If they can put old movies on a dvd, I say do it and don't worry about the Quality to much, It would be a shame to not put old stuff on a dvd so we would never see it ever again and it would just sit in vaults for the rest of time.

4497170,3,B004XQO8NW,"There seem to be an infinite number of these pop-sploitation films, from Alan Freed's ROCK ROCK ROCK (1956) to (surprisingly) one of the best, The Monkees' HEAD (1968). Pop stars not noted for their acting skills run around through goofy situations that somehow provide them with many opportunities to perform their hits. In the middle, of course, is the immortal A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964), and that's the film this one palely imitates. On the plus side, it's in glorious color; on the minus side, it's obviously made by studio execs who (unlike HARD DAY'S NIGHT's Lester and Shenson) have no idea why girls keep screaming and fainting over this silly band. And, needless to say, Herman's Hermits are no Beatles. But if you like the Hermits (or the whole early pop phase of the British Invasion) there are several cute and tuneful performances of fun, catchy songs, and it's stylishly filmed in that sun-drenched BEACH BLANKET BINGO mode. (Stylish, that is, except for the two dream sequences, which are almost intolerable. Who ever thought any dream sequence was a good idea?) Watch it when you've worn out your DVD of HELP! and need a smile. Or, better, try scratching the Britpop itch with this instead: http://www.amazon.com/T-M-I-Show-Collectors/dp/B0030ATZIA/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1366387278&sr=1-1&keywords=gerry+and+the+pacemakers+awards",1366329600,3,1358,5.565217391304348

8447398,5,B004XQO8NW,One of my Favorite films. Great musical numbers by Herman's Hermits. Great fun thru the whole movie. And my favorite actress Shelley Fabares is the love interest. Shelley looks gorgeous thru the whole film. She has a scene in the film where she and Herman set up something special to make a charity benefit more fun. They bring out guys dancing with girls in bikini's. Shelley joins in by stripping off her blue dress and revealing her beautiful  body in a nice bikini! She dances across the walkway in front of Herman and the Hermits as they sing their song. I would say it's my favorite scene Shelley has ever done in a bikini. Her body and her face are near perfect. Look for her in a bikini the the pilot film for Medical Center as well. It's called U.M.C.,1467331200,,760,4.428571428571429
