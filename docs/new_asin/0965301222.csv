7793789,5,0965301222,"This is a great video because Sal Severe brings his wealth of ideas to life using clear language along with his dry wit! If you are visual learner, this is a great supplement to the books. Dr Severe puts the ideas across with warmth and uses many short stories, often funny, to illustrate the messages in his examples. I am finding this useful as a parent and also as a facilitator of parent classes in London, England. Although over 10 years old, I find the material very refreshing and powerful, especially the clear ideas that teaching children to cooperate using a variety of positive techniques, is far more effective than punishmnent. The idea of 're-directing' behaviour is facinating and is a simple idea that I had not heard of before. Dr Severe uses the term 'positive reinforcement' but I found myself thinking of the more user-friendly word 'praise' when listening to his examples. I wish this was available on DVD. Luckily, I have a VCR/DVD combi, but this should be available on DVD to reach a new generation of parents.",1298332800,,1034,4.75
7793790,5,0965301222,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter was going through the terrible two's and dealing with the arrival of a new sibling all at the same time. Additionally her father traveled and the coming and going had her attempting to make him feel guilty by manipulation.
With the stress/temper levels on the rise I decided to order the ""How To Behave"" parenting video so that my husband and I could jointly watch it .
We would stop it after one hour and discuss what we had just seen. We then could discuss our toddler's negative behaviors and how we would both use the information from the video to consistenly and jointly apply loving discipline and teach her the right way  to do things.
WOW! The information was very well delivered and plentiful with examples of ""How To's"" .It really left no unturned stone in how to work with my child to help her and our family lead a more respectful and happier life.
The best part is that after about one week of consistency we had GREAT results.",996019200,36,967,4.463276836158192

7793793,5,0965301222,"If you're like me, you've read Dr. Sal's book, _How to Behave So Your Children Will, Too!_ from cover to cover. You've used the techniques he describes to help yourself and your child behave. But as time goes by, you  begin to slip-to forget some of the techniques that are essential to  practice. Every time I pick up the book, it's a big, ""Oh, yes!"" for me.  ""That's right! I had forgotten . . ."" ""I want to try . . . ""
Even if you  have the book, _How to Behave so Your Children Will, Too!,_ you will enjoy  the video. You may have a spouse who would watch the video, but would not  take the time to read the book. When both parents use the same strategies,  everyone benefits. The video is divided into sections, making it is easy to  view-for whatever time you have available.
My husband and I were  fortunate to be invited to attend Dr. Sal's workshop on parent and child  misbehavior the day this video was filmed. It was a rewarding day. We were  positively impacted by the power of Dr. Sal's parenting message. It was  easy to sit back, listen, and absorb. We left with a renewed commitment to  our son-to practice the parenting behaviors that would enable him to know  how to behave. It felt good to know my spouse was ""on the same page"" with  me. We were a parenting team.
This workshop video is as powerful as the  book, and you have the advantage of listening to Dr. Sal explain the use of  his techniques. You will see real parents-just like you-ask the same  questions you have. In fact, one of the things you will learn is that you  are not alone. Other parents are like you, with the same parenting  challenges.
Some sections of the book are more relevant to you and your  family depending on your child's age and current behavior patterns. When  you view the video, you will find that some concepts are more relevant to  you now than when you first read the book. Most importantly, you will  remember more. This video gives you more exposure to Dr. Sal's parenting  guidelines so that more of the message penetrates.
If you think the book  is easy to read, you should hear the words coming right from Dr. Sal on the  video. He has a gift for explaining complicated ideas in simple and  easy-to-understand terms. Although he makes use of proven psychological  techniques, he explains them in plain English, so that they are easy to  understand. Some experts are big on theory, but do not give parents  specific ideas. Dr. Sal tells you exactly how to behave, so your children  will, too-just as the title suggests.",961545600,44,2531,4.458515283842795
