8329929,5,B001O7SWJ4,"I've watched all 3 of the movies.  You can skip the first one and just go to the second one.  In order to understand the third one, you MUST watch the second one.  I gave the first one a 3 stars, the second one a 4 stars, and the third one a 5 stars.  Why?  Because the third one sums everything all up perfectly.  I debated on watching these movies because of other reviews but I must say that they are pretty good...the second and third one at least.  I won't get into the details, it'll just ruin it all up.  I must say though that in the begining it was a little confusing but once you continue watching, everything just all made sense.  The movie got me thinking back a few times and I had a few moments of ""AH's and OH's.""  There are many, many, MANY, gory scenes.  So gory that I had to look away, cover my face, and cringe.

All in all, a must watch!!!",1289520000,,860,4.023668639053255
8329930,3,B001O7SWJ4,"I bought this movie to watch with my Thai girlfriend and did not get teh chance. She told me kn the phone she was watching it.

She seemed to Enjoy it overall. When is howed this one and 1-2 to her she said its not for her. She lieks scary movies but this one did not apeal to her.

Well she did watch it and enjoyed it. I won't get to watch it untill Aug. But i am looking forward to it.

I gave the 3 star because i have not seen it. I would have givin it a 1 or a 2. It was moved to a three because of my girl friends opinon. First she said not for her than she said good movie. So it changed her mind.",1272931200,,605,3.6030534351145036
8329931,3,B001O7SWJ4,"Art of the Devil 3 (or Long Khong 2 in Thailand) arrives with a weaker story than its predecessor, AOTD2 (LK1).  Basically, there's a cheating husband, a vengeful wife, and an equally vengeful spirit ghost who desires revenge after too much dabbling in the black arts. In the end, there's something of a morality tale (the good character lives because he is innocent and pure, a common theme in Thai horror).

It's all an excuse to show buckets upon buckets of blood, gore, intestines, bones, whatever the filmmakers can do to top the previous death scene.  It's disappointing in that Long Khong 1 had a pretty good story, a creepy setting AND gore that was extreme, but not unwatchably extreme.  This film had everyone in the theater breathing a sigh of relief after it was all over; easily the most gory film I've ever seen.  More than Hostel.  Way more than Saw.

What's unfortunate is the film's first half seems to set up a plot that would result in interesting character developments that might have created some interesting drama, which would be rare for a horror film.  Instead, the story gets lost once the torture starts happening.  Highly recommended for gore hounds, but for those wanting more scares in their horror there is no suspense at all in this one, just lots of body parts ripped to pieces.",1238457600,,1311,4.714912280701754
