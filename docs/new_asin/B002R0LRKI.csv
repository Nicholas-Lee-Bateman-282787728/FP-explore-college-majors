Aside from the (slightly) interesting idea of giving the character choices throughout, the poor acting and ridiculous, unfunny storylines rapidly outstay their welcome. The entire movie is given a posterized, (comic book?) strobe effect that looks circa 1992 and not in the cool, retro sort of way; I felt like I was watching someone's bad movie from high school video class. I'm sorry, I was really wanting to like it.",1442361600,,456,4.922077922077922
8378263,3,B002R0LRKI,"I think if you're willing to give your time to this, you can have fun. Sadly, I wish they hadn't gone for a 'comic-book' aesthetic because I think it distracts and frankly, makes it hard to see what is going on at times (since most of the film takes place at night, the distorted color scheme tends to blend things together). Likewise, it can be hard to navigate the menus and choose the right option because the way you choose seems opposite of what is traditional (usually the highlighted option is what you choose, but in this, the darkened option is what you're really picking).

Still, the plethora of choices and the comedy that can come from them can be very entertaining, especially if you're with a bunch of friends and are making group decisions.

So it comes recommended, but don't be expecting a fantastic product. It's flawed and could be better, but still a worthwhile play-through.",1367625600,,896,4.7006369426751595
8378264,5,B002R0LRKI,"The Weathered Underground is an extremely entertaining movie in a choose your own adventure style.  You take control of a young man and send him on very amusing adventures over the course of one night.  It has many paths to explore, and the choices you make affect not only Eric, but the art style and even genre of the movie.  On different playthroughs you can have wildly different adventures.

The tragidy is that, after releasing a trailer for a sequal, the company that made it appears to have gone out of business, the DVD has gone out of print, and it has even vanished from the iTunes app store.  I strongly recommend that you buy a DVD, so that you can enjoy this unique experience.",1316995200,,691,4.496
