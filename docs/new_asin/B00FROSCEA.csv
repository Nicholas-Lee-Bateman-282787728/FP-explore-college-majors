6030191,5,B00FROSCEA,"I LOVE HULABURN for so many reasons. I'm currently training for a marathon coming up in July and because of all the running, my legs and knees begin to feel a lot of pressure every now and then. I started doing hula burn just once a week and the exercise targets all the areas I need to strengthen as a runner. I was surprised that it challenges my core and lower back muscles too! I love it so much I increased my hulaburn to 2-3 times a week. I feel a difference in my muscle tone too. Alternating long runs and hulaburn seems to be the perfect system for my body and mind! It's great to have an hour in the middle of the day to feel so feminine and sexy. Try it and you'll be hooked.",1391385600,4,686,4.014598540145985
6030192,5,B00FROSCEA,"Loved the work out! I do yoga about 2-3 times a week and I thought my legs would be able to handle  this work out cause it's a lot of squats and poses, but boy was I wrong. The constant moving the hips and constant change of legs during the squats bring that heart rate up and bring the sweat all over JUST in the FIRST 10 minutes!!!!

I really enjoyed the intro to all the moves before the phases started, Kahealani did a really great job instructing.

The moves are not complicated at all, very easy and EFFECTIVE! I work out 6 days a week and this video works your body hard! Trust me you will defiantly feel in in the first 10 min like I said before.

I would highly recommend buying this, if you want a way to burn those calories up! Can't wait to continue to use this in my weekly workout routines!",1390608000,8,804,4.101910828025478
6030193,5,B00FROSCEA,"I love to workout at home so when I saw the commercial for Hulaburn I had to get it.  I emailed the company and they were nice enough to send me a copy to review so I could share my findings with you my readers.  This morning I popped the DVD in and got started with this fun new workout.  I didn't put on shoes just got a big glass of water and hit play.

The DVD starts out with a warm-up and instructions for the basic moves.  The instructor Kahealani takes you through each of the moves slowly and demonstrates them.  She gets you moving and grooving right from the start.  After we go through the moves one time slowly then we add the arms in.  The moves are simple and quite effective at getting that core stronger and more fit.

After you get the moves down then you are able to start the different phases.  There are four phases and then a cool-down.  This workout is a lot tougher than I expected it to be.  There are countless lunges and squats.  Each exercise is separated by the hulaburn signature moves.  I was sweating and had a hard time getting through to the end.  Even though it is difficult it's fun and I can't wait to do it again.  I know that I am going to be sore tomorrow.",1390435200,4,1196,4.1347826086956525
6030194,5,B00FROSCEA,"My sisters suggested that I work out doing what I love...dancing. I used to Hula as a child and loves it. So here we go!! A lot harder than when I was nine. But just as much fun. Start out slow because it is no joke. It is however fun and addictive. I can't wait to do it again. If you have bad knees like I do, just don't squat too deep until you are stronger. Which shouldn't take long since this workout is so intense. I am also glad to be in touch with my hips after having three kids. Nice to know they still sway.",1389139200,4,519,3.8598130841121496
6030195,5,B00FROSCEA,"I had the pleasure of doing this entire Hula Burn workout and felt so great afterwards. It targeted my hips, thighs and arms like no other workout I've had in a while. I love how feminine I felt while doing it as well.  If you're looking for an articulate, sexy and time efficient workout try Hula Burn! I promise you will love it!",1389139200,8,331,4.253968253968254
6030196,5,B00FROSCEA,"So much fun! I never write reviews and buy on Amazon all the time. This was a little misleading because I thought it would be easier because it is hula but it was a tough one! It is very unique and the quality is great. The instructor looks like she has been doing hula her whole life and it gives you something to work up to. She is not annoying like other videos and the music is modern and good, not hula. I would certainly recommend it.",1387411200,2,440,4.068965517241379
6030197,5,B00FROSCEA,"This is an amazing workout, WAY better than Tracy Anderson.  I have been doing it every day and see a noticeable difference.  Have lost 10 lbs so far and almost at my goal weight.  It's fun too, something different and challenging.  Highly Recommend.",1387411200,8,250,4.744186046511628
6030198,5,B00FROSCEA,I just did Hulaburn for the first time and can't wait to do it again. It was hard to get through but so much fun! I had given up on exercise DVDs because I couldn't find one that actually made me feel it soon after. This one did it! No pain no gain! Might actually learn to dance too!,1387411200,2,284,3.830508474576271
6030219,5,B00FROSCEA,I highly recommend this video! Great over all workout and fun to do! Time goes by fast! I felt like my muscles really got a great workout. I''m a former hula dancer and I feel this workout utilized a lot of the basics to constitute the title HULABURN! Love love love it!,1403136000,,270,4.211538461538462
6030220,5,B00FROSCEA,"Love the workouts very beneficial for health, trimming the body and weight loss.  The instructor is very good and obliviously an excellent hula dancer.  I also, take her senior classes at a local gym and she and the class are outstanding.",1402617600,,238,4.780487804878049
6030221,5,B00FROSCEA,"This is the only workout that I've tried that has really put the focus on toning my body, not bulking. I have always had bulkier legs due to fast twitch muscles, and the exercises in this dvd helped me strengthen and elongate my muscles without making me too muscular. Once you learn the moves, it is fun to do to your own music! Definitely worth a try.",1400025600,4,353,4.2835820895522385
6030222,5,B00FROSCEA,"I have tried so many different workout routines and this one is amazing!!  Because I've tried so many, I watched the intro video just to make sure this was something I wanted to do.  I ordered it and, WOW, I was sweating my butt off!  At first I didn't realize how much my butt was burning but halfway through, I really noticed it.  I love the workout and I feel really sexy doing it.  I'm glad there are traditional workout moves incorporated into the workout with the hula moves.  I think you do need a mix of different things and it really makes a difference.

I would definitely recommend this video!  It's fun, sexy, challenging, and different.  I can guarantee you haven't done a workout like this before!",1396137600,7,711,4.4921875
6030223,3,B00FROSCEA,"I was disappointed with this workout.  It is an hour of different variations of squats with very little hula mixed in. I was expecting more hula dancing and this workout doesn't have much, so the name is misleading.  You can save $20 and just put on some music and start squatting. If you need a structured leg workout, then it would be good for that",1395964800,5,350,4.369230769230769
6030224,5,B00FROSCEA,"As a half marathon runner training for my first full marathon, I have become accustomed to tough workouts. I felt the ""burn"" in Hulaburn I mean that in a good way, I definitely felt it working! The great thing about the workout is that it's fun and it goes by seemingly fast. The girl in the video is cute and easy to understand and follow her instructions. She isn't hardcore and overly intense like some workouts I have done previously. As an added bonus, you get a great workout while learning some sexy hula moves. I will be continuing Hulaburn as a part of my marathon cross training and will be recommending to my girlfriends for preparing for bikini season!",1395273600,2,664,4.541666666666667
6030225,5,B00FROSCEA,"This is an amazing and fun workout!  It's a workout that targets multiple muscle groups at once-my thighs, glutes, hips and core really get a workout every time.  And I have really enjoyed learning all the hula moves. Totally recommend it!",1394496000,2,239,4.804878048780488
6030226,5,B00FROSCEA,"So, I have a confession...I only made it to the 2nd phase (out of 4) because this is a legit workout.  My legs were burning halfway through the first phase.  But I love this workout!!!  It works my core, my legs, and who knows what else in the 2nd half of the video.  I just had a baby 6 months ago and this definitely helped me loosen my hips and get my sexy back.  Can't wait to strengthen my muscles again and hopefully make it to the end.  :)  And for all you preggos out there, this would be a great prenatal workout (maybe a low impact version) because it's all about keeping those hips loose.",1392076800,5,599,4.112068965517241
6030227,5,B00FROSCEA,"I love, love, LOVE Hulaburn... It's a great workout plus it's just fun :)
You work up quite a sweat and your body feels more sensual after you do it.
My friend and I started working out together, she loved Hulaburn so much!
I get a lot more out of this than I have most other workout dvds.

Love it.",1391731200,3,299,3.9833333333333334
6030228,5,B00FROSCEA,"This is more of a workout video than it is a video on dancing hula. Kahealani takes you through five basic hula moves: the Ka'o, uwehe, hela, kaholo and ami and incorporates them as transitional moves during squats, kicks and other intense movements. It is definitely a great workout and you really feel the burn. The DvD is divided into a warm up, four phases and a cool down. The phases get more intense the higher you go but they give you a chance to stay hydrated! I'm really pleased with this DvD, Kahealani is very positive throughout the workout and the music is relaxing. I've been doing this workout for a couple of weeks and have already noticed that I am much more flexible and stronger and my posture has greatly improved! I'm very pleased with this purchase!",1391731200,13,771,4.553956834532374
8618348,1,B00FROSCEA,"This is an extremely boring workout. I won't even call it a hula workout because hula is only sprinkled in there conservatively. Five basic moves with no flow, no dance. Not much hip revolutionizing. Squats and a few ami, lunges and a few uwehe. The workouts are also extremely easy, hardly a sweat and none of that liberating feeling dance gives... one star. I will say this would be fine for a beginner for someone who has never done hula, needs low coordination and isn't expecting a hard burning workout! I swear all the good ratings are from friends, there are only a few reviews!",1489881600,,585,4.580952380952381
8618349,5,B00FROSCEA,"There are things I don't like about this dvd, but the bottom line is, every single time I do it I'm down 1 to 2 pounds the next morning, and that has to deserve 5 stars. I think the hardcore Hawaiin volcano on the cover is misleading, because there's no gorgeous scenery as I was hoping for, and the hula moves are a bit of an after thought. I prefer Island Girl ""Abs and Buns"" or ""Tahitian Hip Hop"" to focus on hula and I have better ab results from those. But my weight loss would take much longer without Hulaburn and it's trimming my thighs! I can't recognize them! Lol. There are so many squats and kicks I get super energized by the end. Lost 45 lbs this year since I started.",1478390400,3,682,4.135338345864661
8618350,5,B00FROSCEA,"Loved it the workout greatly!  It was very enjoyable trying this workout. A friend of mine suggested this product, she took into consideration that I have a preference for low-impact exercises, that I am capable of carrying out all the way thru.  The music in the video was a bit slow but the rhythms worked with the workouts intensity. To my surprise, I could with no trouble follow the instructor movements with ease.  In fact, within a few minutes I felt a bit of perspiring and feeling the HulaBurn. Telling all my girlfriends about this workout !:)",1461801600,,553,4.680412371134021
8618351,5,B00FROSCEA,Love this workout one of my favorites I own great for glutes,1457913600,,60,4.083333333333333
8618352,2,B00FROSCEA,"I am very surprised this DVD has received so many 5-stars.  There wasn't much I liked about it.  I opened it, did the workout and will not do it again.  I will probably give this away or give it to Goodwill.  I am really trying to find something good about it, so let me say this.  If you have NEVER done hula, you might like it.  If you don't care about music being inspirational during your workout, you might like it.  If you have never worked out, or you haven't worked out in a long time, you might like it.  If you want to watch a really pretty girl do a pleasant workout, you might like it.  Oh, and there are some beautiful ginger plants in the background.  Now for what I didn't like:  THE MUSIC!!!  IT'S HORRIBLE.  I don't know who on the production crew chose it, but they need to not come up with anymore ideas. I don't want to be mean, but it feels like a joke.  It seriously feels like the crew said to themselves, ""most people who buy this DVD won't know the difference between good music and cheesy music, so let's just use cheesy stock music.""  I was angry the whole time that I paid $20 for such boring music.  The best I can describe it is that it is VERY un-Hawaiian and more like what you would hear in a dentists office in the 1990s on the mainland.  It's really bad.  Secondly, this is supposed to be Hawaiian inspired, correct?  Why isn't Kahealani outside or somewhere tropical or beautiful?  She is in what looks like a nice living room which could be ANY workout DVD.  I expect more from a DVD called, Hula Burn with a tropical paradise on the front of the cover and explosive lava on the back of the cover.

Now to the actual workout - it is very disjointed.  If you buy this you will do some squats and then some basic hula moves, some kicks and then some basic hula moves, and so forth.  The hula is not fused with the exercises, which is what I was hoping for.  Additionally, Kahealani is doing moves without really telling us how to protect our lower backs - it is very questionable, especially since this DVD says that she has a B.S. in Kinesiology.  Kahealani doesn't really describe how to set up the movements - whether it is the standard workout move or the hula move.  She never addresses posture and we do the ami in the same direction almost the entire way through the DVD (very imbalanced).

This DVD is more expensive than other hula workouts and I am not sure why. Other DVDs have multiple workouts on them, whereas this only has one.  And, it is boring at that.

I did look at the reviews before I bought this.  As I said, there were so many good reviews that I was excited and looking forward to having an inspirational hula workout.  This is anything but that.

I am giving two stars (instead of one) because I think people who have never had hula and don't care about having motivating music while they exercise might like it.  But I have to finish by saying that there is a warning on the DVD that says, ""not for tourists.""  Actually, I would recommend this for tourists, but not anyone who is interested in good music, exciting hula and an inspirational DVD.

Sorry to the people who put money and time into making this.  And sorry to Kahealani who seems very nice and looks like she might be a lovely dancer.  If the crew would have filmed her outside with great music I would be writing a whole different review, because those two things would have made a huge difference.

Post note:  Why didn't the creators of HulaBurn use the music in the DVD that they use in the end credits?  The end credit music is MUCH better than the music used in the DVD.",1436486400,7,3600,4.2976190476190474
8618353,5,B00FROSCEA,"This video is amazing! I do a lot of different videos, and this one has got my booty in shape! Really great for doing a few sections of it at first, or if you just want a quick but effective booty builder. Thank you!",1431043200,2,216,3.9318181818181817
8618354,1,B00FROSCEA,"Not as advertised. Not a burn, not hard, very repetitive.  A few kicks or squats mixed with a few repetitive hula moves. Music is like you are at a massage, slow, not exciting like I thought I would get with the ""Hulaburn"" title and the advertised DVD pics. Also, not outdoors or in a Hawaiian setting, but in someone's home.  Not interesting at all. I got bored.  Also thought she was a novice DVD instructor, her timing and cues were not very good.  Maybe good if you are just getting back into shape. A disappointment for me.",1427846400,5,528,4.412371134020619
8618355,2,B00FROSCEA,"I was disappointed in this video.  It's boring and the woman doing it seems so out of it and unprofessional.  It's a lot of squats, nothing really ""hula"" about the video at all.",1418342400,3,177,4.333333333333333
8618356,3,B00FROSCEA,"This DVD does provide a good workout, certainly the ""burn"" is delivered...but this is boring. The movements are very repetitive, and the music is reminiscent of some workout videos from the 80s. Do not expect to learn much hula from this DVD. Expect, rather,  to do a lot of SQUATS.
Also, the production values aren't very good; the setting appears to be this woman's living room! Similarly, she wears standard workout clothes for this hula- themed workout. For the price, and for what I went through to get this-- had to order twice-- I'm quite disappointed. I recommend the Island Girl DVDs instead; the first two are both fun and a decent workout.",1418169600,5,650,4.752212389380531
8618357,2,B00FROSCEA,"Boring, slow music & not fun. I'm sure I would have gotten a good workout if it was more fun.",1404086400,3,93,3.7
