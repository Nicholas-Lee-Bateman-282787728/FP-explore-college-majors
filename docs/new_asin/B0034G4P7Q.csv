4066811,4,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network,"" while it is a realistic look at the creation of Facebook, it is also a look at the culture of cool that pervades our society, ostracizes some, and a few are able to overcome the odds and become successful. At the end of the movie we're told that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is worth 25 billion dollars, but the unanswered question is, at what cost to the person?

Losing a girlfriend has long been the reason for writers to create their first seminal works. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Kerouac and probably any other writer would be a good example. This is how we first see Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) in the fall of 2003, an undergrad at Harvard getting dumped by his girlfriend. After a flip-flopping run home he proceeds to get drunk and start hacking the college's ""face books,"" pictures of the dorms inhabitants, putting online the pictures of the female students and asking them to be rated on beauty. This crashes Harvard's servers and brings attention to Zuckerberg. At first further ostracizing him from the female students, but also putting him in contact with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence respectively), who have an idea for an exclusive student dating service that lists likes and dislikes, interests etc. but they need somebody to write the code for them. Zuckerberg quickly takes their idea and runs with it, runs away with it. He incorporates their idea with his and enlists his one friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), to provide money for operating expenses and act as CFO. Soon ""The Facebook"" is becoming wildly popular. Eduardo is trying to get Zuckerberg to get advertisers but Zuckerberg resists because ""Facebook is cool."" Along comes Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), as a nerds idea of a rock star, fresh from the demise of Napster and looking to hitch his wagon to a paying concern. He mentors Zuckerberg through the minefields of a business, he maintains, only they can understand. All Zuckerberg really wants is to find a girlfriend. At each point where he's rejected it pushes him to expand Facebook and at each of those points he willingly screws the partners that helped him get to where he was. I think there's more back stabbing going on in ""The Social Network"" than in Wall Street.

Zuckerberg is shown to be an inherently unlikable character. Even when he's trying to attract investors he acts anti-socially and contrary to his own goals. Eisenberg's Zuckerberg will probably piss you off, or maybe you'll be sympathetic to his point of view, but ""The Social Network"" is doing its job you don't see the actors as characters but as the people they're meant to represent.

While Mark Zuckerberg may act anti-socially in his private life, the ultimate point may be that social networking is inherently anti-social in that it's not true interaction with people. Or the real ultimate point may be, and what will really matter is, that the first thing you'll probably do after seeing this movie is check your Facebook page.",1285891200,6,3013,4.915520628683693
4066812,3,B0034G4P7Q,"If your main interests in films are the three things in my title line, you're definitely going to love this movie.  They aren't mine, and so I never really got into The Social Network.  I was surprised that it never came together for me, as I have appreciated director Fincher's past work, even his interesting failures such as Zodiac.  This movie had the historical element of seeing the origins of Facebook, but it was much more about the relationship between two friends & business partners, Zuckerberg and Saverin.  In portraying how their relationship fell apart, it was apparently deemed necessary to center the film around scenes set in a conference room, with the two partners (and one other group of aggrieved parties) talking with lawyers.  Actors Eisenberg and Garfield, as Zuckerberg and Saverin, do their best to enliven the lawyer scenes with a lot of sulking, whining and sarcastic asides, but I still felt there were way too many lawyer scenes.  As for the other scenes (partying and programming), that's where Aaron Sorkin's gift/curse hurt the movie.  As screenwriter, he relied almost entirely on his trademark brainy, rapidfire dialog.  It's something that has worked well for Sorkin in the past, on the West Wing and elsewhere, but it can also get pretty annoying sometimes.  That happened right away for me, in the film's opening scene between Zuck and his then-girlfriend Erica.  Their discussion was occasionally funny, but too often just frustrating to listen to.  At one point later in the movie, Saverin is talking to his girlfriend in a cab just after a dinner meeting with Napster's Sean Parker.  He makes a comment about how Sean's self-absorbed monologue ""set a new land-speed record for fast talking.""  At that moment, I was thinking that could be used to describe the entire Social Network movie.

It wasn't entirely without redeeming elements, however.  The acting is often above par, especially Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.  Even Justin Timberlake was good as the Mr. Napster.  And the film's score, by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, perfectly supports the action on the screen.  Overall, though, I didn't enjoy The Social Network nearly as much as I had expected to.",1285891200,16,2202,5.019283746556474
4066813,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The movie hits theaters on October 1, 2010 but I was able to see it at a screening last night.

The Social Network is a great film with an intelligent script, solid acting and great direction. It's enjoyable to watch. It portrays the Facebook phenomenon in a refreshing light.

In the first opening sequence the audience the audience is introduced to a script that makes them think. The film contains very witty dialogue as an Aaron Sorkin (Charlie Wilson's War, The West Wing) film should.

David Fincher's direction is subtle and natural. Fincher (Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) stresses the balance between the characters, choosing to let the actors do the work, instead of forcing them to act in specific ways.

The film is a portrayal of what led to the invention of Facebook and as such is fascinating to watch. Jesse Eisenberg (The Squid and the Whale, Zombieland) is key to making Mark Zuckerberg come off as an understandable character. At one point, he is told, ""You are not an asshhole, you just try hard to be one."" And that, to an extent, is what Facebook is like too.

For anyone who is a Facebook user and mildly interested in the man who created the social network, this film shows a glimpse of the man behind the software and of the intricate powerplays that have made it Facebook what it is today.",1284595200,7,1333,4.63135593220339
4066814,2,B0034G4P7Q,"In light of recent FB events, I though I'd finally get around to viewing this movie.  I gave it a 2 for realism, but in the end it glamorizes the arrogance of Mark Zuckerburg, and wow is he arrogant!  I had no idea that he started out rating women's appearances in an insulting way and that FB started as a stolen idea about a Harvard connection site.  Then everyone sued him.  Lawsuits and depositions will be his legacy as much as FB.  This film puts all of his behavior and his reputation in context, and in spite of the great acting and aspirational entrepreneurship, the main character was so unlikeable and deceptive that I find it hard to give higher than a 2 star rating.",1523836800,,679,4.4

4066831,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I know there will be some that talk about the inaccuracies of this film from what really happened with the creation of FACEBOOK, BUT what I am reviewing here is the film itself---and for me it is masterful.

We're able to see how someone is able to have an idea---albeit questions as to where the seed for the idea came from---and how they were able to turn it into a worldwide phenomenon. This movie is one I have seen over and over---and every time it inspires me. It shows not just the level of concentration and commitment it takes to create something great, but that you have to be willing to go against the grain.

There are some amazing highs shows in this film, but there are also the lows that are not just dealing with relationships and what happens when you are reaching for the stars.

The actors did an amazing job of telling a story that has to be complicated but that is needed for us. Again, you might disagree with some of the ""facts"" in the film, but it's something that is usable in real life if you have a goal or dream you want to see realized.",1514678400,,1065,4.288557213930348

4066869,3,B0034G4P7Q,"If you can buy advertising, you can make or sponsor a movie. I believe Mark Zuckerberg must have watched Almost Famous, the enjoyable biography of Cameron Crowe, teen-writer at Rolling Stone Magazine. Eisenberg's performance here suggests the same inner strength, pliable likeability and reserve of something called faith, throughout the trials and very-important Opportunities along the film's short span.
Nothing like Zuckerberg. One sees more the opportunist, in the news and the creepy mechanisms of the online world.
The reserve and strength of Eisenberg's character suggests at least a role model, if not a family. Yet Mark Zuckerberg and his ""one-friend,"" the feathered hair, nice boy with no gonads, like other Harvard students spring wholly formed from Mt. Olympus. Corny but it's assumed, so they can get straight on to dating. The boat house jocks, though have Daddies. Daddy's lawyer to consult with. Papa's parties, etc. Families, yuck. Not Napster Dude, he comes with a girl bearing his suitcase, and maybe his blow (or just an inhaler?).
Don't buy the nice-fellow side. That's mainly Eisenberg, another trip altogether, like Cameron Crowe of Rolling Stone ""in real life,"" too. In a couple scenes he looks (Eisenberg) as if he has seen Ryan O'Neal's character turn in ""Love Story."" Lacking the hard sell I suspect on the character-level, I'd give this movie 4 or 5 stars, because it also adds to Harvard and academia's allure; here, the campus suggests cool-air Summer nights, cooler or very cold-air congregations during the Fall where so much is at stake, and one need grab or consider each important opportunity.

For better and worse this movie represents America. The ability to create, free enterprise, the internet, without having a dollar to your name, you can use these things to make yourself a millionaire. But we all know, being a millionaire isn't cool anymore. What is also inherently American is to take someone else's idea and improve upon it, with or without their consent. Though what follows, will likely be a lawsuit, another American tradition.

From a filmmaking standpoint the story was told incredibly well by one of the greatest screenwriters of his generation, Aaron Sorkin, using the legal proceedings as the wraparound for the plot from start to finish was a clever device that intrigued and enlightened without being a distraction. The score by first time screen musician (and long time Nine Inch Nails member) Trent Reznor and his tandem composer Atticus Ross was probably the best thing to happen to this film. Without the score it isn't the same movie, it provides a somber tone that gives the movie it's unsettling feel.

You could make the point that the movie also embodied another American ideal, greed. Although Zuckerberg didn't seem to care much about money (in the film and apparently in real life) the corporate greed of the lawyers during the takeover, as well that of the way Sean Parker was portrayed seemed to leave a heavy footprint.

But in the end Rashida Jones' character was right. Paying everyone who was rightfully owed a piece of the pie was nothing more than a speeding ticket. At the time of writing this Mark Zuckerberg has a net worth of $49.7 Billion (making him the eighth richest person in the world), and no amount that was given away could even be remotely considered as significant to that sum.",1480550400,6,1976,4.872023809523809

4066948,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I see that are a lot of 1 stars. I understand. You didn't like the film. That is good. Now, what I like the film? I like Aaron Sorkin. I like the way he writes people. The fast talk. Also, they had to talk fast because the film had to had a specific duration. I read the book and it has a lot of this in the movie. Yes, the beginning of the discussion is made up. Sorkin had to invent some argument to start the movie. He decided that what you saw was the best. I like the fact they talk like that. The real Zuckerberg said in an interview that he had a girlfriend at the time, for which the argument did not happen. That he didn't create face-match due to breaking up with his girlfriend. Ok. Sometimes real life is boring. As most movies done for Sundance, it has the pace of life, which is a guy in a sofa getting high and watching cartoon network.  I am sure a lot people would watch that. I think a guy like Seth Rogen might do it and a lot of people would pay to see and make him millions. Because most people are like that. You know who you are. So, coming back to the movie. Perhaps the movie could have been better using more of the courtroom as the movie a few good man but it is hard to say because everything in the book and the movie is hearsay. If I am upset about someone stealing my idea, I don't think no one is going to see my movie. But it is Zuckerberg from the eyes of Aaron and the book which is in theory Eduardo Saverin doing catarsis of what supposedly happened. It is the same with Apple and Microsoft. We will never know. Justin Timberlake does not drive me crazy. This character in real life is worse. They could have used an actor who can do a more damaged, drug user personality. Who knows, maybe Sean Parker offer in real life to use cocaine and other drugs to Zuckerberg to get ideas and to help him over work the creation of facebook. I would not be surprised. If you hang out with the rolling stones, I don't think you are going to drink tea. This movie could have been darker. I went to college in the 80s and I have seen very strange stuff. So, I wouldn't be surprise if it is worse today. In that sense, the movie was really, really, really light. But, I guess more courtroom and the rich twins asking for money might have been great, but then stories of rich kids it is a hard sell. Who cares. I like bad movies too to learn how not to do things. There is always something to learn from every movie.",1456790400,,2437,4.077083333333333

4066957,1,B0034G4P7Q,Cause I almost fell asleep. I couldn't get into this and Eisenberg talks to fast. His rants are self-indulgent and a pain in my gut to listen to.

Seriously, I have a hard time seeing Jesse in any of his other movies as that movies character.  Fortunately, he rocks as an actor and I start seeing him in that role pretty early.  So, it's all cool.  Now, Nicholas Cage, he's always Nichols Cage just playing a role.

I don't think much about this movie was accurate in the slightest. I don't believe Mark Zuckerberg was really that witty in those hearings. I don't believe he used to club like that, hooking up with girls and all that. Looking at his real life relationships, it's clear he's not anything like that. David Fincher took serious creative license with this project in hilarious ways and a lot of people fell for it.

The reality is, this guy made a social networking site that made people realize how much they really hated social networking sites. Not sure how much money he will end up with in the end, but I hope he has it saved, because the gravy train is coming to an end soon.",1452988800,3,839,4.343949044585988

4066961,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Quite disappointed with Sorkin's script of ""Steve Jobs"" I decided to watch ""The Social Network"" again, Sorkin's ""other script"" about a computer industry giant.
""The Social Network"" is a lively, emotional movie, with a riveting story line. Since most people are familiar with how Facebook came to be, the script is about the little details. ""The Social Network"" has everything ""Steve Jobs"" doesn't.

Whereas I criticized that viewers of ""Steve Jobs"" (the movie) don't know what drives Steve Jobs, ""The Social Network"" features all these scenes. In this movie Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg) suffers being taken as a nerd. He wants to be a part of the ""in""-crowd.

He observes how the popular and the not so popular students experience college, which is why he is able to create this social network better than others. He has churned every thought before it became part of the FB profiles.

The movie also shows the difference between the ""old way of doing business"" personified by Zuckerberg's original partner Eduardo Saverin (played by Andrew Garfield) and the new way personified by (Justin Timberlake's ) Sean Parker.

It was a brilliant movie in 2010, when I saw it first, and it still is today.

All that could be shown in a movie called ""The Social Network"" is not here. It's more about ""My idea of how Mark screwed us"".
I was hoping for something different. The good news is, there is more information for someone else, with a true vision of ""The Social Network"" to revisit this subject, and make a really good film. So tired of Mark sitting, staring, walking in sandals, and being an unfit partner and friend.
Too bad, they forgot that he met his now wife during this time, and obviously could partner with someone.  It would have been good to learn more about the person, and less about the cartoon version. Two stars for the Sean Parker character. Not because I believe that this is an accurate portrayal of Sean, but, because Justin Timberlake at least brought life to his character, albeit skewed life, that was the written role. So Justin's Sean Parker had life, and good acting for the part.  I believe all of the roles were written skewed, but hey. Justin killed his.",1444176000,,1221,4.754716981132075
4066997,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network (2010)
  2010 was a kind of desert that we have to cross to find the occasional oasis of great or even above average films.  The Social Network comes along and shows us what not just a very well made film looks like but what a film of historical importance looks like.  The Social Network gives us a peek into the fast moving world of high technology and high finance.  The mostly true film tells the story of college student Mark Zuckerberg over a period of about one year when he invents and develops a new idea for application to the worldwide computer network.  Zuckerberg went from unknown college kid to mulit-millionaire in that time.  He is now 26 years old (in 2010) and worth about seven billion dollars.  He is also stupefying intelligent.  The movie shows what can happen when outright genius meets with the proper opportunity.  It is marvelous.
 There is so much that is good about this movie that it is hard to pick out the best people to laud.  First place should go to writer Aaron Sorkin for the script.  The development of the character of Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg-more about him later) is very carefully controlled and deliciously spooned out.  We get a feel for the young genius in the first scene where he is in conversation with his then girlfriend.  It is as good a dialog as anything I have ever seen.  Great screen writing.
 And the great writing is spoken, with bewildering rapidity, by actor Jesse Eisenberg (most notably from Zombieland, The Social Network was his fourth screen appearance in 2010.)  Eisenberg plays the young genius as a fast thinking, socially inept striver who knows absolutely that he has his finger on the main chance.
 Justin Timberlake, of whom I have no clear opinion or even knowledge, delivers a smashingly good performance as the dude who invented Napster.  He falls in with Zuckerberg and shows the young up and comer the ins and outs of the venture capital world in California.  His personal flaws quickly force him from active participation in the new company, but not until he slices off a little, very profitable chunk for himself.
 There is a reason why things like Face Book are invented here rather than say, France.  In America we reward people who have successful ideas, genius ideas, and can build them into something that people will want to use.  This film shows just how quickly things can happen when the time is right.  It is very instructional.  Do French geniuses go into philosophy or do they move here to make their fortune?
 This mostly true drama has already brought in a satisfying $85 million on a $50 million budget.  It is rated PG-13 (some pretty raw simulated bathroom sex, some drug use) but I rate it as deserving a very high 4.5 saw blades.  This is a very good movie, a timely movie and an instructional movie.  You should enjoy it as much as I did.",1443571200,,2869,4.646123260437376

Thought it really got across well the personality of a very bright, ambitious but insecure and egotistical computer person who gets his extraordinary success at the cost of trampling collaborators and a girlfriend.  Of course he's very young - just a college kid -  and somewhat drunk a lot of the time; anyone could have made some of the same kinds of mistakes in his situation.  The film is a bit like a moral tale is showing you that you've got to stay away from the internet when upset and beery.  It also shows how central creator characters forget that they had collaborators as their projects gain traction.  They only see their contributions.  But, hey, a pretty amazing website was born and nobody got killed, just a couple of relationships, and, in the end, Zuckerberg made things right, apparently, in the legal settlements.  I wondered about whether the twins really were responsible for the idea, since, in all that time they never did a project like that themselves.

I use facebook every single day and i'm happy he made the decision to make facebook global and not just a university website like it was when it was first launched. The social network is one of my favorite movies that is based on a true story. It's not a ""nerd"" film and it can be enjoyed by people of all ages i believe. It's one of my favorite movies ever and i love the story and i think the characters we're played very well by the actors.

Normally I'm not a Jesse Eisenberg fan, I don't go for the whole pensive, uptight and skittish personality he always portrays, but in this film it really worked for him. Add in a little attitude for flare and you get a dot com anti-hero of sorts. It's an engrossing movie, but wavers on its ability to captivate you entirely. That however doesn't keep it from being a fantastic movie none the less, full of one liners and comedic deliveries that make the film not only epically quotable, but great fun to watch!

A couple of the high points in this movie seemed to mean that this movie should get 4 or 5 stars, but the rest of the movie deserved like 2 or 3. I hate to say the most obvious thing, but the casual subject matter kind of pulled down seriousness and gravity of this movie. Just a movie about the guys who started FaceBook? Only partly interesting, and not fantastic. I've said it before, but movies based on real life events tie your hands as to how dramatic and exciting they can be, because most of life is pretty run of the mill, even events like founding FaceBook. The watershed, cathartic moments were fantastic, but the movie fell back down into focusing on pretty ho-hum events. The whole time with a movie like this, I am also wondering if we are getting the whole story, and are we just getting one guy's point of view. Is the ""bad guy"" in this movie truly bad, and how did things happen from his point of view? At the end of the day, the movie masterfully handled the subject material, but didn't choose great subject material to begin with. I keep wondering when movie making will finally get so casual that we just watch two people sit there, and then finally get up to go throw something in the microwave, and that is the whole movie. Movie making no longer concerns itself with grandiose subject matter anymore, and it's getting too casual to be noteworthy.

4067133,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Mark Zuckerberg was a talented computer science major at Harvard in the fall of 2003. His girlfriend had just broken off their relationship. He needed an endeavor to fill the void, and he had an epiphany. He downloaded pictures of 'hot' women members in the various sorority houses. His group of friends then compare two photos and vote on the more attractive in appearance, setting up a ranking system. Others online begun to take part in the voting process, and it becomes a campus-wide phenom with more than 22 thousand hits (requests for web pages) in two hours, causing the university's site to crash. The female students being voted on and ranked apparently were not too amused, and some were even offended, thinking it callow and a superficial, contrived means of attributing value to anyone. Mark was practically ostracized in one of his classes when a fellow student passes him a derogatory note. After reading the brickbat, Mark leaves. But before exiting, he gives the answer to an abstruse, esoteric problem the class had been working on. The instructor, impressed, asks if the class saw how Mark derived his answer (OK, a nominal overstatement, this is the crme de la creme, after all). When no one responds, the instructor proceeded to work through the solution with them. Later, in the movie, negative opinions of him reverse, and he reached celebrity status when the popularity and use of Facebook climbed into the stratosphere. Students and student governments from around the country began emailing and calling Facebook to have their colleges added to its roster. During this expanding phase, Mark was fortunate to meet and have as mentor the convivial Sean Parker (soft-spoken Justin Timberlake), a founder of Napster, the peer-to-peer music-sharing site. Sean convinced Mark to spend the summer of 2004 in Palo Alto, California. Silicon Valley, as it is known, is the entrepreneurial capital of the high-tech Internet industry. There Sean will introduce Mark to savvy San Francisco investment bankers and venture capitalists who understand social networking. Very entertaining!",1415145600,,2097,5.188790560471976

4067154,4,B0034G4P7Q,"Mark Zuckerberg is a bad guy. Mark Zuckerberg is just trying very hard to be a bad guy. David Fincher's The Social Network examines this binary and other conflicts resulting from the founding of social media website Facebook, without judging Zuckerberg, or the other main players. For a movie about a socially awkward programmer defending himself in court, Fincher has created a surprisingly compelling experience, but focusing on Zuckerberg limits empathy.

The movie is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which Aaron Sorkin adopted. It begins with Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) in a college bar with his girlfriend Kate (Rooney Mara). ""Dating you is like riding a stairmaster,"" Kate gives as her reason for breaking up with him. Drunk, angry, stupid, and blogging, he returns to his dorm room and, using an algorithm created by roommate Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), develops a computer program that allows users to rate female undergrads on looks. After this program crashes the university computer system, the resulting notoriety gains the attention of the Winkelvoss twins (both played by Armand Hammer), who recruit Mark to develop an online social network that utilizes the Harvard.edu email address. When Mark develops Facebook on his own, and it becomes a phenomenon, Saverin and the Winkelvoss twins file separate lawsuits.

Fincher uses the legal proceedings as an entry point. The movie intercuts between the courtroom and flashbacks, allowing for a Roshomon-like multi-perspective retelling of pertinent events. The editing is masterful in keeping different strands and sequencing together. Despite multiple time jumps and changes in perspective, the viewer is always oriented. Similarly, Fincher is in full mastery of cinematic grammar. Note how the film emphasizes Zuckerberg's isolation in how he is shown as an outside observer of celebrations in his honor. The largely digital score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross has the perfect tone, locating emotion in digital whirls and bleeps. The acting is strong too, as Eisenberg plays Zuckerberg with a focused, yet isolated intelligence. Justin Timberlake is very good too as Sean Parker, imbuing the Napster founder and Facebook investor with an odd combination of attraction and paranoia. And Mara shows strength in the show-stopping opening bar sequence.

And yet, despite the cinematic achievements, this is at its core a legal drama about a college students pursuing their own self-interest. At its core, The Social Network is oddly cold and smooth. The closest to an empathetic point of entry is Rashida Jones's character, who specializes in jury selections. She listens to the courtroom narratives and concludes that creation myths need a devil. The devil in The Social Network is characteristically evasive.

It is easier to admire The Social Network than to adore it. Strangely, or perhaps appropriately, for a movie that explores the role of technology as a social tool, it is sometimes difficult to connect emotionally with The Social Network.",1410393600,,3049,5.385744234800838

Many proponents and critical champions of the film have had the gaul to herald The Social Network as my generation's Citizen Kane. Well... I think that's a completely accurate statement to make. Even I agree with them. It actually is my generation's Citizen Kane. The themes and nods are all there. Hearst as Zuckerberg, right down to the sled. Refresh, refresh, refresh. The Social Network is a very touching and revealing character study about a troubled young man who will become wholly emblematic of his time and place.

""You have part of my attention - you have the minimum amount.""

The film opens with a lengthy scene of dialogue between Mark and his girlfriend. What's so unique about it is that you have to listen closely because the scene is jumbled with the chatter of a murmuring pub. And you can hear the background noise louder than you would like to have it or have been used to hearing it in other films. It's almost like we're right there with them, listening in. It's hard to hear comfortably at parts but I find that decision enthralling. Director David Fincher is trying to tell us something here, he's trying to prepare his audience. He's telling them to listen up and pay attention because this movie demands it. He uses this same tool later on in the film at a night club where Mark is being taken under the wing of a character with questionable motives. Fincher says once again, listen closely. This is a scene that demands concentration. Read between the lines, Mark is. Why aren't you?

Let's talk about the star of the film, Jesse Eisenberg as Mark, for he is going to be the reason why this film will never be forgotten. Eisenberg was outstanding here, laying down the best performance in film since the '70s. Naturalistic and contained, it was an absolutely beautiful portrayal. It harked back to Al Pacino's Michael Corleone from The Godfather Part Two, it was that impressive. What Eisenberg was able to do with Mark was something very precise. He made the character a complex one. One that was guarded, calculated, methodical, and incredibly lonely. A character that can be very cold and sad and unforgivably oblivious.

The idea proposed by Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin is an interesting one, that the creator of a website designed to connect people around the world to all of their friends is not only socially off-putting but is so selfish and vengeful that he has no friends of his own. He has no support system. Eisenberg makes Mark out to be a loveless, wounded, and perpetually hurt person with quiet anger and resentment. The most perplexing aspect of Mark's character is that he is opaque and protective, resentful but there is a dying desire there as well. A want not of fortune but of impulse. I don't think Mark wants to be so cold. Then again, sometimes I think that's exactly how we wants to be perceived. He never really seems to honestly enjoy his successes. He never acts like he wants the money. He never really seems to want much more other than to be seen as someone stronger than he is. He wants to be different. Eisenberg communicates things along the lines of self-punishment and hatred with Mark. It's in his face and the quiver and shake of his voice. It's all in how a person so precise can be so uncomfortable in his own skin.

Eisenberg is a very responsive actor and the key to his performance is in his reactions. The little ticks that he does or the facial stretches that are both surprising and full of pathos. Eisenberg did something extraordinary in The Social Network. Truth be told, this was an unsurmountable performance, mammoth in poignancy and tragedy. What Eisenberg was able to communicate with his portrayal of Mark is something for the history books. If this film will be remembered for anything, I hope that it will be because of him. Such a complex delivery! I love that The Social Network is not really a film about Facebook but a complex, intimate, and puzzling character study of the touching from a distance variety. His performance is made of composites, all of which equally compounding and involved. Eisenberg's intricate approach, along with the occasional trip of haywire, is only augmented by Mark's impenetrable and inaccessible frozen heart.

Or is it even frozen? Maybe he's a kid who has a whole lot of heart but doesn't know how to use it. He had forgotten how a long time ago. Now he just is. But does he want to be? Does he yearn? In a performance that touches upon both the easily readable and the abstruse, Eisenberg molds a legendary character. A pillar of the actor's cinema. A startlingly perfect performance from an actor who has obviously mastered the craft. He got lost in Mark. I'm sure of it. This role had so many layers and it only gets more astonishing the more of them you peel back. Eisenberg was stunning here. A truly perfect and touching performance. Like I said, one of the best performances I have ever seen.

What is this film trying to say about my generation? Honestly, I don't really care much about that aspect of it. With the exception of the actors in participation, the rest of the filmmakers were older men who are most likely out of touch. I mean, my generation is inherently out of touch by nature so how could Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher know any better? This is not to say that Sorkin's script isn't great or that Fincher's vision wasn't coherent, fluid, and interesting to watch. I'm only saying that this film may not be the generation defining film in terms of territory and material, but it is generation defining in terms of acting and character. Eisenberg towers over his contemporaries. I've been waiting for an actor like him to come around for a very long time to kind of show the way for the others. I also hope that this film brings the character study back into popular demand. It's been a few years now since The Social Network was released and films just aren't seeming to catch on. It was a special kind of film and I guess we're not headed toward a new renaissance but at least it existed. A reminder of what the medium can accomplish. It focused on and examined a character who was not only a complicated one but one that shared a great likeness to it's coeval and modern audience. In the idea that Mark as a character is representative of my generation's cold resolve, the film is truly generation defining. It might not be the film my generation claimed but it's the one it deserved. It may not be an exact interpretation of my generation but it makes for a damn good silhouette of it.

4067190,5,B0034G4P7Q,"A movie about Facebook, Directed by David Fincher.

Spoiler Alert: This Movie Was Awesome.

So in the 21st century, we as human beings are very aware of the online invention that is Facebook, and the fact that a movie has been made about ti is no surprise, but what is a surprise is how good it was.

Now I don't have a Facebook account nor do I want one, but what I did want before I saw this movie was some info about why Facebook is such a big deal, and guess what, I finally got ALL my questions answered.

In terms of ""Based On A True Story"", they couldn't have chosen a better Director than the Ever-Realistic David Fincher,
and per my opinion, that's probably what made this movie so compelling.

Before this movie, I knew Jesse Eisenberg was a good actor, but this movie showed me that he is a great actor.

Apart from the truths in this movie, it also worked as a kind of Social Commentary about people.
I've seen some of the behaviors exhibited in this movie in real life, and I now
have a better understanding of why and where these behaviors come from.

And to think, a movie about Facebook should have been a cash grab/box office bomb, but this movie went above expectations,
and The Bottom Line is holding steady at an
89%- David Fincher directs a grand look into one of the biggest and most profitable inventions of all time and
it's creators, as well as a social commentary for the modern generation that is deserving of multiple views.",1401667200,,1452,4.395522388059701

Okay, so the movie was good and flows well. This is something that all Hollywood features now-a-days lacks. Content is well presented and to be honest I think it was the best movie I seen that year as StarTrek (2009) took the crown for the year prior.

Some might not agree with this analogy but the Social Network or MZ story closely parallels with the Manga Berserk. He slayed his friends and was reborn as this Social Networking god. Throw in a women or two here and there. Blood and guts is really just economic and legal sanctions and the stories share a similar tale!

I highly recommend this film if you're into individuals that become massively successful, like the Google Guys or Bill Gates. This film also teaches us a lesson of greed. Don't be greedy, but in some cases, it might have to be necessary. This is so because in order for companies to evolve, they're going have to make some sacrifices, in which Facebook took the necessary precautions to do so. Eduardo Saverin personally deserves much more recognition. For those who doubt my statement, then think of yourself in his shoes. Not fair, right?

4067258,5,B0034G4P7Q,"By 2013, you would have to be the most disconnected, non-technical person in the world to not know what Facebook is.  With over 1 billion current active users, there has never been a more ubiquitous method to connect to so many people in the world.  Of course, there have been social network sites in the past that made somewhat of an impact (Six Degrees, Friendster, MySpace), but never with the reach that Facebook has achieved.  A seminal cultural construct like this begs to have its origin story told.

  ""The Social Network"" is the relatively successful attempt to tell that story.  Adapted for big screen by impresario Aaron Sorkin, ""The Social Network"" is based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich.  There is some debate over the accuracy and over-dramatic nature of Mezrich's account.  However, assessing accuracy should not be the point of a review like this.  Assessing the entertainment value, acting and plot is the point.  On that baseline, ""The Social Network"" is a very entertaining tale that holds up under multiple viewings.

  The plot surrounds how Harvard undergrad, Mark Zuckerberg, along with friends Eduardo Saverin and Dustin Moskovitz (and, later, Sean Parker) brought Facebook to life and the roller-coaster of battles that ensued:  with the Harvard campus for violating privacy; with the Winkelvoss twins for allegedly stealing their idea and using it to create Facebook; with Saverin, after he was unceremoniously booted out of the company.  The acting is top notch.  Jesse Eisenberg looks like Zuckerberg's doppelganger and acts very much like how one who expect `Zuck' to act based on his public persona.  Andrew Garfield exudes pathos as the frustrated and betrayed Saverin.  A real find in ""The Social Network"" is Justin Timberlake, who plays Sean Parker, the highly motivated entrepreneur (and Napster Co-Founder) who is determined to help take Facebook to next many levels.  Timberlake continues to prove that he has legitimate acting chops (see ""Alpha Dog"" for another example).  He's not just a former boy band member trying to `diversify'.

  One interesting aspect of repeated viewings of ""The Social Network"" is how your perception of the main characters can change over time.  Upon the initial viewing, Zuckerberg comes across as a complete anti-social, self-centered jerk while Saverin seems like the earnest, hard-working and horribly-wronged co-founder.  However, when you see the story unfold multiple times, you realize that, while some of the personality traits remain constant, the motivations are no longer as black and white as they seemed.  You can see that Zuckerberg had a vision for making Facebook something well beyond your typical social site and Parker (who seems Machiavellian, initially) has the know-how and drive to make that happen.  Saverin, who you would original sympathize with, begins to be seen as more of a guy who was content to let this be a middle-of-the-road business (as his actions would show), as he lacked the insight to see outside the box and help take Facebook to where it would go.

  Overall, ""The Social Network"" is a fascinating parable about business, college life and friendship.... And all the headaches they entail.",1384300800,,3225,5.191860465116279

that it illustrated his rise to fame and showed his flaws and immaturity as well as his genius.

What is also showed is what a great country this is, that college kids can become millionaires with a good idea and hard work.

Kudos to all the actors who were imminently believable in their roles. In movies there is this thing called ""suspension of disbelief"" where you give yourself over to the story line.  It was so well acted and filmed I felt like it was a a home movie shot behind the scenes.

4067264,4,B0034G4P7Q,"THE SOCIAL NETWORK is very well-filmed, and though the dialogue is sometimes a little TOO ultra-witty, its natural acting helps to bring about an immediate realism.  It focuses mainly on the legal complications and conundrums, i.e., lawsuits by Zuckerberg's fellow students at Harvard who played big roles in spawning and developing the whole idea of Facebook. I never would have dreamed it possible that someone could make a legal drama set mostly in depositions rather than trials work so well, but this film accomplishes just that--the fact that it's a true story certainly helps. It gives a well-rounded and convincing picture of the various entanglements Facebook went through in its early stages, also effectively showing how just about any large corporation-to-be experiences similar issues. While Zuckerberg is portrayed as less-than-likeable, his precocity is hard to ignore, and THE SOCIAL NETWORK gives a very non-editorialized portrayal of him and all the other players here. There's also a lot of Ivy League-level girl-chasing, partying, and so forth, which, again, is shown so realistically that it's quite engrossing.",1378771200,,1132,5.468571428571429

Along with a gorgeous looking transfer of the movie with top-notch picture and sound, this disc has a looong documentary showing the making of the film.  It's entertaining and very enjoyable to watch.

I can't say enough great things about David Fincher's work here.  He took a recent story that I thought sounded meh when I heard he was working on this project, and with the amazing writing by Aaron Sorkin and directing OCDness by Fincher himself made a GEM of a movie.

Incredibly rewatchable, this is what most films aspire to be and few achieve.

Millions of people have ideas, but most are not able to implement their imagination.  This film gives the public a window into Harvard, the students who attend that institution, how an idea is germinated, and finally, how what seems to be a simple idea is turned into a multi-billion dollar company.  The Big Three (listed above) did not actually graduate from college, not counting honorary degrees; however, who cares?

Unfortunately, the film just wasn't as good as I hoped. I do think most of the actors did a good job but the story suffered from too much ""poetic license"" and the embellishments detracted from the facts of how Facebook really came to be, the relationship between Mark Zuckerberg and others, etc.

There were also points where it really dragged, and the film told in a series of flashbacks wasn't the best method of execution. But it was well-paced and held my interest.

Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

4067342,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network (2010) Starring Jessie Eisenberg Is About Business Majors In College And Their Destinies.

Money won't buy you happiness, but you'd never know that due to screening ""The Social Network"" about billionaire before he was 30 Mark Zuckerberg, founder and owner of ""Facebook"" internet website of fame.

This movie is a love letter to Mark and all others who worship big money as an ideal....the reason to go to Harvard University, the reason to drop out (not clear from the movie if Mark dropped out or just took time off but did indeed get his undergrad degree....no mention in the movie of his major studies...if any...at Harvard!)

The Social Network (2010) starring Jesse Eisenberg is about young man named ""Mark Zukerberg"" who was a 2003 era Harvard College Massachusetts USA undergraduate computer nerd who became the main owner of Facebook and is accounted the youngest billionaire in the USA ....possibly in the world (as of 2010 according to the printed ""what happened later"" post script words flashed onto the screen in the final scene, a closeup of Zuckerberg/ Eisenberg at his laptop computer staring mournfully at a photo of his former girlfriend.) The movie won the 2010 Golden Globe ""Best Drama"" award and may win the top 2010 Academy Award prize (not yet announced as of January 2011 when this review is being written).

So, what's it all about and why all the interest? It shows the world of money hungry business majors in college and shows the life of one who grabbed the golden ring, and achieved big money....the wet dream of all business majors and of the part of American society which believes (sincerely!) that ""the business of America is business!"" And profits, and big money, and all that is part of that.

The star of the movie, Jesse Eisenberg, is a young man portraying a college age undergrad at Harvard College, and was probably born in the 1980's when Ronald Reagan was USA President, and put the final nails in the coffin of Franklin Roosevelt's ""New Deal"" programs, and Lyndon Johnson's ""Great Society"" and ""War On Poverty"" programs.

USA President Bill Clinton put additional nails of importance into the same coffin when he gave the USA ""NAFTA"" and ""ended Welfare as we know it."" Reagan and Clinton (and the two Bush USA Presidents) announced sincerely that ""the party's over"" and it was and is.

What remains is what The Social Network (2010) starring Jesse Eisenberg shows.....a heartless social climate where the most famous and prestigious undergraduate college in the USA turns out alumni like Mark Zuckerberg and Zuckerberg's great contribution to America is Facebook and status for him as a billionaire under the age of 40.

When American politicians and government renounced Socialism and all vestiges and/or imitations of it starting with the election of Richard Nixon as USA President in 1968, the world of ruthless business grabs, takeovers, fast buck artists, and kingpins like Mark Zuckerberg began.

Nixon rolled out the red carpet for all this, and the men who followed (USA Presidents from both major parties, both controlled by big business always without a doubt, regardless of protestations to the contrary) began.

The Social Network (2010) shows the USA's national disease at the college level, and shows at least partly what Harvard College has become....not a center of culture and higher ideals, or a place where ""Veritas"" (""truth"" in Latin...Harvard's emblem motto) has any place, but place which attracts and nurtures people like Mark Zukerberg and his minions.

The Social Network (2010) is not great art. It's not even good art.

Like so many Hollywood movies of past times, it is sensational journalism...a portrait of ""what's happening"" and a behind the scenes look at it all the ""newspapers of record"" never quite inform people about.

It's depressing, but it's the truth.

The Social Network (2009) is a paradigm of what American culture has become. Low standards, the best school in America taken over by low life, dreadful people, and a major Hollywood movie of low quality made about it all, and given the ""Best Picture"" Academy Award in Feb. 2010 (for ""Best Picture"" of 2009).

Ugly people doing ugly things, and we're all supposed to celebrate this and pay attention to a big movie made about it. Damn!

It's like Gertrude Stein telling the world 100 years ago that Pablo Picasso was and is a good artist, and his ugly art worth being ranked with Michaelangelo and Raphael.

The Social Network (2009) is eerily similar to Wall Street (1985), made almost a quarter of a century before (Michael Douglas got the ""Best Actor"" Academy Award for Wall Stree). A movie about bad guys presented in a way that many are expected cheer for the bad guy.

Michael Douglas played an ""Ivan Boesky"" type.

Jesse Eisenberg played the actual guy who goes to war with his friends and others at Harvard, cheats 'em and wins. In The Social Network (2009) the movie makers didn't even change the name. It's really a ""docu-drama.""

Ugh!

Aaron Sorkin won the best screenplay Academy Award for SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) and deserved it.

The male Harvard students show similar arrogance, though to a lesser degrees. As for the female students, they seem to be in school just as groupies for the sex parties.

The directing/scripting calls attention to itself away from the story through the gratuitous use of flashbacks and the mannerism of having the characters speak very fast.'

Once again we are taught that the way to financial succes is on the backs of others - even your friends.  lol  And that Zuckerberg is more like Bill Gates than I ever knew.  Both seem to be d-bags to anyone who befriended them when they were nothing but complete nerds.

FWIW & just my opinion, I've often noticed how nerds bring the dislike of nerds on themselves.  They are often self centered & either unaware or uncaring of others' feelings and then wonder why no one likes them.  If Zuckerberg were cool and talked to people like he does in this film we'd all be calling him a jerk.  Remember this the next time you feel sorry for ""the nerd"".  People often get what they give.  Man, what a film!  Sorry for going off there, but that's what watching this film did for me.  Got me to thinking, alot.

Happened to have this film SOCIAL NETWORK film in the house and watched it with my son who joined Facebook in 2004 when he was a student at NYU. It is fun to recall how it first entered out lives. Myspace was just so junky looking, my son commented. And when you're in college you really want to know people's status.

This is a fascinating look at the company's origins--did Zuckerberg really steal the idea from some Harvard twins?

And cheat his partner by diluting his stock? One more good reason for Eduardo to move to Singapore and avoid hundreds of millions on his taxes when Facebook went public.

It was hard to tell the hype from the honest story and you were so entertained by the film, you really don't care. You are willing to watch the suspenseful unfolding of the success. The script by Sorkin is masterful. You hang onto the repartee. It's fun to watch smart people interact--too bad their character doesn't always keep up with their intellect.

My son commented he wanted to know how the ideas came up for some of the features of Facebook and wished the film had featured that more. And show how use of Facebook has evolved. We'll probably need another film--perhaps a documentary--on that. It is reported that Facebook created their own film when it went public that is more interesting than this one. Truth is often more interesting than fiction, if stranger. But in the meantime, this fictional film regarding Facebook's origins is worth watching.

I heard Zuckerberg say after seeing this film that he doesn't remember partying as much as the film indicated they did--they were working most of the time. But he agreed it was an entertaining film.

I loved it and am looking forward to Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, take on Steve Jobs in an upcoming film, based on Walter Isaacson's biography. If you're fascinated by Facebook and social networking, you should enjoy this film.",1337472000,,2130,4.774456521739131

He objectifies women, capitalizes on hurting people, and delights in humiliating others. He's a tool and a jack***. What's more disturbing is this movie is glorifying it as people come out of the theater talking about how brilliant instead of disgusting Mark is. But I guess that is the status quo. Nobody cares anymore. Narcissism is cool. It's all about ""self"" and the ""I do what I want!"" attitude.

4067365,5,B0034G4P7Q,"David Fincher's take on the men behind a social networking juggernaut is an ensnaring riff on adolescent genius, intellectual property, misplaced loyalty and the blurred line between inspiration and plagiarism. Jesse Eisenberg is magnetic as the quick-lipped, scorned, socially acidic orchestrator Mark Zuckerberg; armed with both a fiery stockade of dialog and a vibrant crew of supporting actors to fire it at, he never wants for the right words, nor the perfect target, for an occasion. Eisenberg is especially effective in the dry, serious legal hearings he's subjected to throughout the plot, where he's most at liberty to cut to the quick with a pointed jape or toy with the formulaic arguments of a prosecutor. Sufficiently technical without flooding the plot with IT-speak, it's as sharp and engaging as Good Will Hunting, if not as touchy-feely and redeeming. When it was all said and done, I was left with the same impression of Zuckerberg as I was of Steve Jobs after finishing his biography: the guy's a scumbag, but he found his sweet spot in this world and made the most of it, for both himself and society at large.",1331683200,,1130,4.9526315789473685

I find period pieces to be a very intriguing genre of film. They depict a past that I'll never know. But if I'm lucky, the really good ones will manage to transcend the times and live on as a sort of cultural imprint throughout the rest of history. David Fincher did this for the most in 2007's Zodiac, in which he showed audiences the captivation and obsession of the Zodiac Killer saga through the eyes of Robert Graysmith and how the case affected the lives of many throughout Northern California area in the late '60s and early '70s. However, Zodiac is a period piece with emphasizing more on sleuthing, police procedure, and mystery-solving elements and isn't so much ""relevant"" as it is just ""engrossing."" Enter Fincher's next period piece: The Social Network, which follows the accounts about the founding of the social networking behemoth we now know today as Facebook. One night during a presumably harmless conversation between Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his date, Erica Albright (Rooney Mara), the two strike the subject of final clubs, which would then lead to a rather harsh breakup and serve as the sole catalyzing moment that would lead to the evolution of said social network. Fast forward to a legal hearing in the present day where Zuckerberg is giving depositions for the lawsuit against him from the likes of his once best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), and supposed ""intellectual theft victims"" Cameron and Tyler [the] Winklevoss [twins] (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence). Meanwhile, there are various jumps throughout the rest of the film depicting other events, including a meeting with one Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), about all the drama and deceit in-between, and its bitter aftermath for the people involved.

I know, it sounds weird; this movie was released in 2010 and I'm already calling it a ""period piece."" But I believe this film has accomplished the extremely rare feat of solidifying itself as an instant classic way before its place in hitory has even been determined yet. It's difficult to say just how far the Information Age will progress. Fifteen years ago, I don't think anyone would've expected smart phones, computers, and the Internet to develop as quickly they have, let alone the mere existence of a concept like social networking. But it all goes beyond technology. The Social Network also represents the feelings, attitudes, and demeanor of an age where people can now get by, not just with tech-savvy knowledge, but through something even more valued by these times: social status. In particular, social status and its exclusivity. It's become a harsh, but often forgotten, fact of life that what you know will not always get you somewhere in life, but also who you know. Throughout the film, despite Zuckerberg's ""punk rage"" and ""rebel cause"" to take a concept like exclusivity and make it a worldwide phenomenon available to everyone, it also depicts the fast, cold, and cutthroat values capitalist society has come to accept as ""successful,"" as evident by all the legal proceedings, arguments of ownership, and constant involvement of money. Even more shocking, it also puts our own values into question with the power to friend, unfriend, or look people up at the simple click of a button. In the end, The Social Network is a timeless masterpiece that will serve as one of the pinnacles of the, now, fb generation and Information Age and serve as a fantastic character study in the coming decades when society has moved to the next big thing.

Shot digitally by Jeff Cronenweth on the Red One MX camera at 4.5K resolution, the video transfer is as sleek and stylish as its script and the clarity as eerily defining as the film's thematic legacy. Much of how I feel the movie itself is a monumental representation of its era and place in history, the cinematography does a stupendous job showing this in parallel. Being a mostly dialogue-driven film, a lot of the shots consist of closeups and static frames that contain very little to no movement by the actors (who are mostly just sitting and talking to each other). But don't let the talk-heavy nature fool you. Despite what little motion there is, it's still very easy to appreciate the lighting, production, and general photography of the all the people, sets, and actions happening within these moments. The color scheme tends to possess a very natural palette that more so reflects the time of day or mood of the situation, but leans a little more towards amber skin tones, greys, browns, and other Fall colors for the overall art direction.

Detail is amazing for all its subtleties, crispness, and extremely sharp line quality. Black levels are especially deep with a great deal of delineation in low-lit scenes that help maintain the movie's dark mood, while at the same time providing a very clean and precise presentation. Just look at the opening scene when Zuckerberg is talking to Albright in the crowded college bar. Even amidst all the smoke, haze, and dim lights, the picture is proficiently sharp. Contrast picks up in a matter of minutes when Zuckerberg gets back to his dorm and starts programming, with everything from the curls in his hair to the individual smears of marker from the algorithm written on the window being clearly visible. Subsequently, later shots in the movie (specifically the Ruby Skye VIP room) will display some deeper, more vibrant colors. At any rate, the film has an enormous amount of detail in just about every shot (even the dark ones), which is especially easy to appreciate with all the closeups, and should come as no surprise as to why it rightfully received its Oscar nomination for cinematography.

As low-key as the movie might seem in terms of audio potential (a character drama about the creation of Facebook with lots of dialogue), you wouldn't think the sound design would be all that great. I mean, it's a lot of code speak, keyboards clacking, and vocal reverberation in a bunch of dorm and deposition rooms, right? Not the case. As unremarkable as the audio may appear on the surface, this is quite the understated sound design that really does more than it should thanks to the mastery of subtlety by sound mixer Ren Klyce and the musical genius of composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, whom I really have to praise for their Oscar-winning score. The music simply drives the film's overall sound mix by creating a great deal of ambiance and an electronic tone reflective of the movie's theme to really keep the audience in to things. Particularly, the piece ""In Motion"" when Zuckerberg goes on his drunken hacking spree, has a lot of bass and rhythm to it that really gives the surround sound system a nice work out and contributes an ""engaging"" to the grand scheme of things.

Directionality and separation of sound effects and ambient noise are crisp and clear from the front and rear speakers. The opening scene in the bar is just one of the many examples where you can hear a lot of the subtle sounds of people talking, glasses clattering, doors opening, and furniture moving all over the place. Or, even in quieter scenes like where Zuckerberg throws a bottle cap across his desk; a chicken clucking in the background when Zuckerberg is talking to Saverin; the grandfather clock ticking in the background of the Winklevoss' dorm; the door bell at the summer house in California; all of these are subtle in presentation, yes, but the quality and architecture of it all and the fact that it mixes so well with the music is what's outstanding. And then there's the bass. The Ruby Skye VIP room is by far one of the loudest scenes in a movie I've ever watched on BD. The bass is so insanely deep, my wireless keyboard literally fell off my couch by the end of the scene, which has only happened in two or three other instances. So yes, the audio is deceptively reference.

Extras - 5.0

Disc 1

- Audio Commentary (Director David Fincher)
In another great commentary by Fincher, he starts off in detail about the casting of Jesse Eisenberg and Rooney Mara and how he sort of fell upon them with just a little bit of exposure. He then talks about how the shots of Harvard were actually filmed at Johns Hopkins with the occasional matte painting insert because Harvard was being uppity about filming on their actual campus. He also talks about a number of other topics such as: realism in the technicality of actual typing/programming and how it was all just blue screen that later had the text typed up to match the actions of the actors, the omniscient presence of The Phoenix Club and the kind of ""mysticism"" that came with its name, the awesomeness of Josh Pence and his ability to pick up a lot of the physical mannerisms that Armie Hammer had created while they worth both playing the Winklevoss twins, how the Bill Gates in the movie is actually the official Bill Gates impersonator (whom I honestly thought WAS Gates when I first saw him), the 3 distinct musical forms of the main theme and how each one represented a different aspect of transition in the plot, the casting of Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker because of his innate ability to channel a form of ""executive charisma"" required for the character, how they couldn't shoot at the actual Ruby Skye club, and many other anecdotal stories or explanations pertaining to themes of the film. This is a must-listen for fans.

- Audio Commentary (Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin; Actors Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, and Josh Pence)
This track is a lot more jovial than Fincher's, but also contains a wealth of information and trivia. It's funny to hear Sorkin talking about how he wrote the whole movie and how the script looked on paper, but then couldn't understand a single word of what Eisenberg was saying in the context of things like the code speak or deposition lines. He also talks about some of the script/screenplay changes they made, how they ended up casting some of the actors, and then shooting logistics. Eisenberg talks a lot about his portrayal of Zuckerberg, the chemistry he tried to build with Garfield, about his sister and how he used her as a little bit of inspiration for the role, and points out the fact the costuming was all taken from actual photos of the real people. Garfield, Hammer, and Pence interject here and there with some great anecdotes about shooting the movie and the research they did in preparing for their characters. Timberlake doesn't get a whole lot of time, but he does a good job telling how he landed the role of Parker and the kind of character he wanted to portray in relation to, not so much the authenticity of the history, but for the movie itself and how everything would work out thematically by the end. If you like the movie, I highly recommend you give this track a listen to compliment Fincher's.

Disc 2

Note: It is not a typo that I kept all the featurette titles in lower case, they were all lower case on the extras menu in Facebook font. I thought it looked cool and am trying to preserve it here as my own personal quirk.

- how did they ever make a movie of facebook? (HD; 1:32:43)
The following featurettes pretty much cover the entire production of the movie itself showing how they shot some scenes on location, CG'd some others, did the whole Winklevoss twins look with two actors but only one of their faces, the various different angles they used for editing, and even have some pretty insightful comments from cast and crew throughout. The four segments are as follows:

- commencement (7:56)
Talks a lot about the 3-week rehearsal they had and the kind of mood they wanted to establish in the delivery of the script and how those lines could best be achieved through the characters. It wasn't so much about learning what to say, but how to say it and effectively set the atmosphere with the dialogue from the get-go.

- boston (29:19)
Starts off with Eisenberg talking about the filming experience and how it was a little easier to do this than what he's done in theater. Also takes a look at how they shot the opening bar scene from two cameras to capture the speed of the conversation so they could make the multiple angles for the final cut. Eisenberg then goes on to talk about his character portrayal of Zuckerberg showing a little footage of he, Fincher, Garfield, and Sorkin in a meeting to further break down some the underlying themes of the story. Of most interest, though, is the work that went behind the Winklevoss twins. It shows the preparation taken to cast both Armie Hammer and Josh Pence, the computer trick they used in grafting Hammer's face onto Pence's body, the training they underwent for the rowing sequences, and the difficulty in eating a lot of hamburgers when doing as many takes as Fincher likes to do.

- los angeles (26:01)
Starts off by showing the Bill Gates speech rehearsal, then shows the pool scene, how it was shot, and has a little opinion from Eisenberg about why that particular scene didn't agree with him and who he thought Zuckerberg was being portrayed as. Then, there's a little blurb about Sorkin and how he loves to write screenplays and dialogue, but not so much a plot. Next, is a look at Timberlake and his reflection on playing Parker and how he wanted to point out certain details about his character, as well as the irony of playing Parker who basically ruined the music industry he was once a part of. Next, they take another look at the work that went into the Winklevoss twins' performances, specifically how each one of them fed off the others' work and incorporated said quirks as their own. And finally, we get an interpretation from various cast and crew about the themes of ambition, its power to corrupt, and how it ultimately affected the friendship of Zuckerberg and Saverin.

- the lot (30:02)
This segment has more visual exposition just showing how things were shot with a little bit of commentary in-between from the actual set, rather than showing something and having cuts of interviews in front of the camera to go with it. While there's not a whole lot of information being given from anyone in particular, I find it fascinating to see the whole process carry out from something of a voyeuristic viewpoint as a natural flow of things instead of the usual retrospective they give after the fact. Around the last third of the feature, however, they start to add more interview-esque commentary about the overall experience of the film itself, their general feelings of the characters and writing, and how good of a finished product they ended up making. It's a nice way to cap things off, as I feel it really shows all the hard work they put into it.

- jeff cronenweth and david fincher on the visuals (HD; 7:48)
Both men go into detail about shooting the film digitally and how the Red One camera does such a great job capturing a wider color spectrum and even the smallest amount of lighting from on-set fixtures. They also talk about how Fincher shot Zodiac and Benjamin Button on the Thomson VIPER Filmstream camera, and how he sort of helped pioneer the use of digital cameras in film-making in general.

- angus wall, kirk baxter, and ren klyce on Post (HD; 17:24)
I'm particularly amazed at the amount of editing Wall and Baxter did. They had 268 hours of footage and different-angled shots that had to be cut down to a 2-hour movie. They give an example by showing about a dozen takes of Zuckerberg saying, ""If you guys were the inventors of Facebook, you'd have invented Facebook,"" and of Saverin saying, ""I was your only friend.. you had one.. friend,"" just to show how every performance on each individual take can vary and that capturing the right kind of emotion is key to making the scene ""feel"" that much more connecting. Meanwhile, Kylce talks about the sound design and how Fincher wanted him to take a lot of the important dialogue scenes and crank up the ambient noise and effects to full volume so that audiences would be forced to listen carefully. They show us a couple of examples in the various versions of the opening bar scene and the Ruby Skye club. They give us a dialogue-only, a noise/ambience-only mix, then the final product of each. This is easily my favorite extra on the entire collection, and I highly recommend it to those who are interested in technicalities of film-making.

- trent reznor, atticus ross, and david fincher on the score (HD; 18:55)
Reznor and Ross are basically in a giant room with a bunch of synthesizers, keyboards, and other instruments with Reznor doing all the performing and Ross mixing all those sounds together to make music. Reznor points out that he wanted to make the soundtrack more like something you can just listen to as music, as opposed to music that accompanies a scene. Fincher then discusses the film's main themes (""Hand Covers Bruise"") and how there are 3 different versions to symbolize the progression of Zuckerberg's character. They then show us how the theme changes between the beginning, middle, and end of the movie. It's a very insightful look at the music and I'm really glad that Fincher or whoever put this together realizes the importance of how a good score can really affect a movie.

- in the hall of the mountain king: music exploration
This is more of an audio exposition with comparisons between the first and final drafts of the track itself and how it looked in the finished shot. In the previous feature, Reznor and Ross talk about how it was a fairly easy process to make the actual score for the rest of movie outside of this piece. For this one, they spent about 3 straight weeks working on it and were figuratively ready to just kill themselves when they finally finished it.

- swarmatron (HD; 4:28)
A short look at one of the instruments used for the music. It's basically a big strip that you can run your finger on and make a different number of sounds on with varying pitches. But there are also a bunch of knobs that can combine and separate the sounds into one or many different other pitches. Some of the sounds were kind of ethereal, while others were a bit creepy. Interestingly enough, the machine needs a key to turn it on.

- ruby skye vip room: multi-angle scene breakdown
This is an interesting look at how they planned and filmed the entire scene of the conversation at the club. It actually has 4 different segments that can either be viewed individually or as a composite view where all 4 of them are open in their own window and whichever box you've highlighted will play its audio. I couldn't get the time stamps down, as each chapter said it was only about 3 minutes, but then the title time said the whole thing was around 19 minutes, which just doesn't add up. But here are the 4 views, anyway:

- rehearsal
- interviews
- tech scout
- principal photgraphy

Overall - 5.0

The Social Network is an amazing film. It's a period piece and character drama about rebellion, ambition, betrayal, the driving forces of our society, and the innocence lost in all that mess. It's more than just about how Facebook was made, it's a commentary on the what happened because of Facebook, how all the people involved were affected, the decisions they made, the philosophical issues raised, and how we, as a society, can relate to that, be it directly or indirectly, whether we use Facebook or not. Regardless, though, Sony has a winner here with reference quality A/V specs and lot of great special features. This is definitely a must-own movie and a cinematic gem that will surely stand the test of time throughout the years to come.",1327276800,2,19861,4.736476713913798
4067376,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Though I do use Facebook, watching a movie about the guy who started it all sounded like a total snooze-fest. How could a movie about a nerdy code-writer who was sued by everyone who claimed to have helped, be worth watching?  On the advice of others, I finally watched Tne Social Network, and saw that this is the story of one man's quest to connect to others, and how he failed miserably for himself, yet ended up allowing the world to connect. Now that's Irony with a capital I.

Zuckerberg was so inept socially, that I had to wonder if he suffers from some sort of high functioning type of autism, like Asberger's or something similar that might account for his chronic foot-in-mouth disease.  I love the opening of the movie where Zuckerberg's soon to be ex-girlfriend tells him that one day he will be very successful at his computer programming and end up wealthy, which will cause him to think that this is the reason for his lack of success in his personal relationships. No,she tells him, it won't be the success that will be at fault, but Zuckerberg's himself, because he is an a...hole.  There is a sad scene in the movie where Zuckerberg's looks up his old girlfriend on Facebook, yet knows that she might be the only person on earth to refuse to accept his friend-request.

Who knows how much if this movie is the truth, though Zuckerberg was sued by all those connected to the beginnings of Facebook, and he lost, so it would appear that Zuckerberg did betray his friends and others who obviously had stake in Facebook.

By the time the movie was over, I wanted to cancel my Facebook account, but then there does seem to be a bit of sociopathy that goes along with succeeding in our society. Justin Timberlake plays the inventor of Napster, and what a great job he does of it. For such a like able actor, Timberlake made you hate him as he portrayed the drugged-out, authority-phobic, megalomania with apparent glee.

The Social Network is worth watching on many levels. My favorite, was as a character study on how intelligence can make a person miserable if it's not balanced with an equally high level of emotional intelligence.",1327190400,2,2147,4.63421052631579
4067377,4,B0034G4P7Q,"This latest David Fincher movie is all it's cracked up to be.  What is seemingly a pretty boring premise (geeks and the internet) turns out to be an interesting character study and even presents a more modern day equivalent of Wall Street than ""Money Never Sleeps"".  We see how ideas are corralled and fortunes are made.  Well we don't actually see how the fortunes are made.  Advertising and sales are seemingly not important.  Money is to be made when ideas are packaged and sold to others who think they can figure a way to be profitable.  If we are to believe this quasi-biography we see that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is a real ass-hole.  A great performance by primo geek Jesse Eisenberg is spot on.  We also get a nice performance by Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker, another real ass-hole.  There is another brief but important peek at Rooney Mara as Zuckerberg's erstwhile girlfriend.  We can see how Fincher is smitten with her.  Me too.",1326844800,,970,4.748502994011976

4067391,4,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network"" is based on the true-life story of Mark Zuckerberg, founder/creator of Facebook, the vast social-networking site.  I'm not sure how true-to-life the movie actually is but I'm going on the premise that most of it is correct.

Mark Zuckerberg is not a nice person, not a friendly person, not a sociable person.  In fact, if he's at all like the movie, I would hazard a guess that he has the developmental disorder, Asperberger's.  He does not deal well with social interaction; he's brilliant at a narrowly focused field which allowed him to have Facebook up and running (and expanding) very quickly; he has a difficult time separating his actions from consequences.  If he doesn't have Asperger's, he definitely suffers from some developmental/social disorder.

But over and above all that - I've had this DVD for months and put off watching it because I couldn't believe that it would be very entertaining.  I finally decided to take a chance and this is one compelling movie.  It's kind of like watching a train wreck and being unable to look away.  Amazing performances especially by Jesse Eisenberg playing Zuckerberg; Andrew Garfield as Wardo, Zuckerberg's ONLY friend; and Armie Hammer playing the Winklevoss twins.

All of this makes it totally appropriate that it's a film by dark director David Fincher, with a soundtrack by the equally-sinister Trent Reznor. When I first heard that Fincher, known for making violent films like Alien 3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and Zodiac (okay, maybe Benjamin Buttons doesn't fit that bill entirely), I thought it was pretty strange departure from his oeuvre, and that his adaptation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo would be a return to form; now I wonder if The Social Network is actually the film that returned him to form.",1318723200,,815,4.513513513513513

But, it's just so robotic, there really isn't any human element at all; it's empty.  Jesse Eisenberg does a fine Jesse Eisenberg, which is a shorter version of Michael Sera.  Timberlake has some appeal early on, but it quickly fades and you question why he continues to be in the story.  I did enjoy the portrayal of the Winklevoss twins and their little buddy; they were a bright spot in the movie.

4067396,4,B0034G4P7Q,"This involving and fascinating film is the story (and the trial) that surrounds the development of the social phenomenon, Facebook. I got my DVD the moment Amazon.com notified me it was available.

We start in 2003 (was it that recent?) as we watch Harvard undergrad Mark Zuckerberg clumsily derail a potential date. He is brilliant, thoughtless and socially incompetent (maybe a touch of Asperger's?). Oblivious to the hurt he inflicts in that perfectly fine young woman, his first on-line venture springs from his desire to strike back at her.

This perfectly cast film boasts the following characters:
*  Jesse Eisenberg (""Zombieland"") IS Zuckerberg: smart, ambitious and emotionally isolated.
*  Andrew Garfield (""Boy A"") is perfect as his patient and much-exploited roommate and would-be friend. It looks like this guy might be our new Spiderman in 2012...
*  Roonie Mara (""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" US version, 2011) is that unfortunate date.
*  Armie Hammer (TV credits) is amazing as the conflicted Winklevoss twins; Harvard gentlemen don't sue other Harvard gentlemen just for stealing an idea. He (they) look like taller versions of young Prince William.
*  Justin Timberlake (""Alpha Dog"") is Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, who wants a piece of the action.
*  John Getz (Lots of TV) is Zuckerberg's lawyer. I'm only including him because I've liked him ever since ""Blood Simple.""

A lot of the action takes place on a college campus, so we see stereotypical parties, drug use and general misbehavior which is mostly ignored by our computer hacker/nerd, Zuckerberg. The contrast is nicely depicted by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (""Charlie Wilson's War"") and director David Fincher (he'll be doing the American version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""). There is plenty of humor because we have 20/20 hindsight and KNOW what happened with Facebook. The tagline for this movie is: You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.

Once again, we are treated to snippets of what happened after the trial which is central to the film. I always appreciate that!",1317945600,,2094,5.114369501466276
4067397,4,B0034G4P7Q,"I went to wikipedia after watching this movie because I was a bit curious as to what Zuckerberg was like before he got to Harvard. I think the addition of the material I found there would have put another layer of understanding for us in this movie.  It is very well written but I think the pre Harvard Zuckerberg needed to be included. This movie begins at Harvard and we never look back in time.

What I discovered was that Zuckerberg was a child prodigy.  He was creating things from earliest childhood and since electronics were there in earliest childhood, he latched onto them.  He was blessed in having two educated parents who realized they had a prodigy so he was given all the support and education such a child needed. He was also the head of the fencing club at school and was excellent at fencing. (To put it mildly, this would have fit this movie's storyline perfectly.) He was also excellent at the classics and could recite the ILIAD and the ODYSSEY to anyone upon demand, among other things. Harvard took one look at his record and he was accepted.

The movie tends to view him much more one dimensionally.  He is seen almost exclusively as a computer nerd and that he has a computer person's personality.  He is extremely unlikable from the very first frame of the movie.  His mannerisms are as off putting as possible.  This makes a lot of sense when you realize he was a child prodigy.  They have a long history of not adapting to social situations well and are notoriously bad with people.  So Zuckerberg's ""problem"" with having a miserable personality does not really stem from his being outstanding at high tech.  He was outstanding at everything.

The movie greatly concerns his legal problems with other students at Harvard who claimed they were in on the making of Facebook and that Zuckerberg needed to compensate them for that.  But one thing is apparent from day one: on their own they did not have the ability to create anything complex from start to finish. Inventors do have to be able to go the distance with an idea, not just get an idea.

So there is a lot of law in this movie and a lot of legal wrangling.  I could have used a lot less of that despite my being a lawyer.  I was much more interested in Zuckerberg's emerging from being a child prodigy into being the creator of Facebook than I was in anyone else's sort of working with the same idea and wanting to sue Zuckerberg.

Jesse Eisenberg does a wonderful job as Zuckerberg. I am looking forward to seeing more of his acting work.

4067400,3,B0034G4P7Q,"Zuckerberg's opening statement in the movie - ""Did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States,"" reflects either Zuckerberg's fatuity, which I doubt, or the screenplay writer's - Dean Evenson's (who probably didn't score 1600 in his SAT).  In the distribution of IQ scores of any large randomly sampled population, we use an operational definition of those referred to as ""cognitive elite"" or ""genius"" as the top 5 percent or the 95th percentile of that population.  China today has a population of 1,348,527,108 people; those in China who would probably be considered genius number approximately 67,426,355 individuals (POP X 0.05).  The population of the U.S. today is approximately 311,000,000 - an amount far greater than the 67.4 million probable geniuses in China.  Those whom you would consider to be ""unusually bright"" are probably somewhere in the upper fractions of the 99th percentile - a very thin slice of the overall Chinese distribution and much fewer than the 67.4 mil calculated above.

That un-nerdy statement at the beginning of a movie about nerds turned me off immediately, however, the acting and the rapid fire dialogue resurrected my interest!

There are very few films I will watch repeatedly, and this is one of them. In fact, the first time I watched it was late one night, and I watched it again the very next morning. Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is neurotic and spot-on. Justin Timberlake plays a slimy Sean Parker.

4067406,3,B0034G4P7Q,"I fall into the latter. I am not on FB and have no interest in being on it. I don't consider The Social Network a movie. It was more like a documentary without being a documentary (of course it couldn't be because some of the info/characters are made up, and I think it is horrible that the makers did that). If you admit you are intellectually shallow and need to watch cars blowing up, sex scenes, or hot women/men, to keep you interested, then this is not the film for you. It's a film with lots of dialogue, a lot of talking, and no action. I enjoyed it from the aspect of business. How the seeds of it came about out of a man being embarassed and depressed (business lesson: turn your heartache into a business), how deals were made, how you can get screwed over, there was also a story about the man who founded Victoria's Secret, why he did it, that I did not know, e.t.c. These are the things I enjoyed about the movie. We all know that most of the portrayal of Zuckerburg is true. He really is a cowardly, cunning, and very computer-smart thief. The twins brought the idea to him, he took it, yet out of all the money he was making and becoming ""cool"" he still seemed very unhappy. Right up to the end of the movie. And I did not like how the film ended. It seemed ""unfinished."" Timberlake is good in his portrayal of one of the most annoying, disgusting, rude characters I've ever seen (looked up Sean Parker and breathed a sigh of relief that he said his portrayal is completely fake; he's actually friends with Eduardo). This is an interesting film about business and extreme greed but only needs to be watched once.
Personal opinion: I don't see why Zuckerberg was named Time's Person of the Year and gets all this attention. He honed someone else's idea about a site for people to connect with each other. He has not saved lives. I'm not knocking his achievement, so I say a Nickelodeon award or something like that is appropriate, but Time? Sorry but Cesar Milan should receive that for saving the lives of millions of dogs. Lack of knowledge has caused the deaths of many of them.

That girls wouldn't like him because he was an a-hole. He went on to make the last part of the prediction true by drogging (drunk blogging) and starting a demeaning girl comparison website that very night.

The first part of the prediction took a little longer.

This is a look at why and how the monster Facebook was started, and reveals the players, the greed, the conniving and the strategy that has made it the thing that it is.

It turns out a lot of friction concerning Harvard grads were responsible for its creation, or rather... that's what makes up the storyline, resulting in one boardroom meeting after another. In fact, expect to see a neverending series of boardroom meetings that brings forward all the young college kids who believe they are the ones responsible for the creation of facebook, so from here, it's all about money issues and legal ownership of the website.

The Social Network isn't for everyone. Some might find it ludicrous sitting through a 2-hour movie on the subject of facebook. I won't disagree. However, to be fair, the movie writers made it so there's never any *really* dull moments. The need to keep the viewers attention must have been evident by the movie writers because they found a way to make it work, so they deserve a lot of credit for that.

Overall, patience is an obvious requirement, but besides that, if you can sit through a storyline dealing with the development of college computer geeks finding worldwide success with a website everyone still raves about to this very day, go for it.

However, a trio of other students are impressed by his technical skills and hire him to create a social networking site. When they discover that Zuckerberg has created a rival site based on the same idea, 'The Facebook', they decide to sue him for intellectual theft. At the same time, as Zuckerberg's fame grows and the site becomes more and more popular, he risks alienating the friends who helped build him the site.

The Social Network is a movie which has a substantial problem: the premise is a very hard sell. The story of Facebook's founding is pretty straightforward: geek hits on winning idea, becomes billionaire, cheeses off a lot of people along the way and gets sued. In order to make a compelling and entertaining movie, the producers decided to bring out the big guns: hire the writer of The West Wing to pen the script, get the director of Fight Club and Se7en to direct, employ the creative force behind Nine Inch Nails to produce the score and finally bring on board a number of the best, promising young American actors of their generation to play the roles. And it more or less works.

David Fincher directs the film like a thriller, using intense close-ups and a steady pace, intercutting between the two court cases in the present and events unfolding on-campus in 2003-04 to give us a clear overview of the situation. He uses some great techniques to make otherwise dull scenes real energy, such as the use of rather bizarre camera techniques whilst the Winklevoss twins row in a boat race to the sound of a crazy cover of Flight of the Bumblebee. He is helped by Sorkin's clever script with its rapid-fire dialogue and cutting insults which may lack realism (were these young people really all that incredibly witty?) but is a lot of fun.

Performances are excellent, particularly Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, who delivers a controlled, twitchy performance with outbursts of (improbably good) acerbic humour. Armie Hammer plays both of the Winklevoss twins through a combination of CGI and split screen techniques which are flawlessly executed (not being familiar with Hammer's prior work, I genuinely thought they'd hired a pair of twins to play the roles), and his performance is excellent, reaching a height in a scene where the twins confront the president of Harvard and are told to their incredulity that they don't have a leg to stand on as they try to punish Zuckerberg for 'stealing' their idea. Andrew Garfield - the soon-to-be new Peter Parker - is also great as the most sympathetic character in the film, Zuckerberg's best friend Eduardo Severin who is screwed over for no real reason (though note that Severin is the only major player to cooperate with the writing of the book the movie is based on, which may account for this). Justin Timberlake fulfils his early acting potential by playing Sean Parker, the founder of Napster whom Zuckerberg turns to for advice despite Parker's irresponsible reputation, to Severin's disgust.

So, we have a great script, some great actors and a great director. Does this add up to a great movie? Almost. The film is ticking along nicely and is saying some interesting (if somewhat over-familiar) things about fame, avarice and genius when coupled to a strong work ethic but a lack of morality, when it just stops. There's no real climax or a conclusion, the movie suddenly screeches to a halt on a rate trite note: Zuckerberg is told, completely contrary to everything we've seen, that he's not a bad person in an awkward scene that might as well have, ""PLEASE DON'T SUE US,"" flashing at the bottom of the screen. This is one of the risks of making a film based on events that are so recent. The Facebook story is still ongoing, and the film simply catches up with the present day and then runs out of plot. No real conclusions are reached, or are indeed reachable, since we are also told that none of the major participants could take part in the movie due to various legal gagging orders and NDAs, meaning a fair amount of guesswork has to go into the story. There's also some rather interesting deviations from the facts for the sake of drama, such as the fact that Zuckerberg had a steady girlfriend for almost the entire timeframe of the events in the movie, but in the film he is presented as a bachelor who is motivated by a bad break-up.

The Social Network (****) almost succeeds in being a modern dramatic version of Seinfeld: a movie about nothing that succeeds thanks to winning scripts, performances and direction. The tremendous creative forces involved make the film as tense and effective as it can be, but at the end of the day there is the feeling that this is a movie which is based on a thin premise. That they make it into such a compelling movie is a tribute to their skills, but the lack of a climax leaves the film feeling a little incomplete. The movie is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).",1310947200,,5062,4.728199320498301

4067418,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Fans of the movies always seem to adopt films as defining their youth.  For my folks, it was hard to beat ""The Graduate.""  For me and my friends, John Hughes' ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"" capture the careening highs and lows of being a teenager in Reagan's America better than any other movie.  I imagine that college students of the last decade will look to David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" and say, ""Yeah, they got it right.""

""TSN"" is not a documentary by any means, but despite focusing on the meteoric rise of the world's youngest billionaire, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), and the founding of Facebook, ""TSN"" gets to the heart of what it means to be a young adult in the age of the Internet.  Zuckerberg's genius was that he could step back and recognize the desperate human need for social connections and he was able to translate it to the Internet.  Older generations may see younger Americans as a batch of loners as they sit glued to their laptops or PDAs, hammering out emails and texts while seemingly ignoring the world around them.  But thanks to Zuckerberg, the youth of America are connected as never before.

In lesser hands, the story of the creation of a website would bore you to tears.  Instead, Fincher took a script by Aaron Sorkin, one of the most incisive, thrilling writers we have, and created a fascinating tale of the creative spark and the toll it took on friendships.  The ""hero"" of this story could only be Zuckerberg, but Zuckerberg fails almost every test of heroism.  A social outcast at Harvard, Zuckerberg should cherish the few friendships he has, but he uses blatantly lies to friends and colleagues.  He willingly ""trades up"" from his best friend and business partner, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), when the bigger-and-better-deal comes along in the form of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), founder of Napster.  And so it is that Sorkin and Fincher are able to use two competing lawsuits to structure this complex story as well as give it a Rashomon-style changing perspective.

I'll leave it to others to recap the plot details, other than to say that this is a complex, dense story. Sorkin won his Oscar for best screenplay for telling this story with such energy and style.  The early scene showing the creation of Facemash, with its hacking and e-gibberish, deserves heavy analysis by every wannabe-writer out there.  The special effects are subtle but powerfully effective, including having Baltimore and Johns Hopkins step in for Boston and Harvard as well as allowing Armie Hammer to play both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (with a major boost from Josh Pence).

All the performances are strong, but special kudos need to go to Eisenberg and Garfield for playing best friends who go to war over Facebook.  Eisenberg personifies the wounded little genius who exacts his revenge on his best friend for (largely imagined) grievances, while Garfield plays the loyal friend who gets pushed too far.  In a director's commentary, Fincher gives a lot of credit to these two actors, but it's safe to assume that Fincher coaxed these two actors along.

I think, the script diluted the copyright phase to make it faster or understandable. And so was the episode moving to Silicon Valley and financing. But surely the shot with Sean Parker in the club was most fascinating ... it encapsulated the very concept of entrepreneurship and venture capital and its relation with tech and industry in US.

Garfield is the perfect friend. I can't wait to see his version of Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the upcoming superhero movie.

Justin Timberlake gives us the man behind Napster and you can pretty much place the blame on his shoulders for how Facebook exploded out West as well as the destruction of the friendship between Garfield and Eisenberg.

4067425,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Having never been a fan of David Fincher's work, I was knocked out by the quality of his visual story telling in this film.

Fincher uses some great nuances within his photography: how Eduardo is constantly seen 'outside' of the party, how Zuckerberg is obsessed with becoming 'part of the crowd' - an indicator of his character's desperately low self esteem.

My favourite scene in the film was where Zuckerberg receives the call from Parker towards the end, and the caretaker turns off the lights in the facebook offices. It's a great touch, Zuckerberg has cast aside his old reliable friend and now his new unreliable friend is also soon to be gone. No matter what he does, Zuckerberg is shown as being constantly alone - even when he is in a crowd.

I'm sure a lot of the film was made up, but there are some great messages within the script.

1. The problem between Zuckerberg and Eduardo is the fact that Zuckerberg has low self esteem and Eduardo does not. We see Zuckerberg constantly trying to gain approval from those around him, and even filling his house with sycophants in a bold attempt to make himself feel popular. Eduardo doesn't suffer from the same complexes and seems happy enough in his own skin, he never seems angry at being made to be the outsider - he doesn't need the approval of Parker or anyone else - he is content to be his own man.

2. The film isn't really about facebook, its about how you perceive yourself.

3. NEVER sign anything without having your lawyer read it!

4. Eduardo doesn't mind being Eduardo. Zuckerberg hates being Zuckerberg. Hence, Zuckerberg dislikes Eduardo and betrays him in a desperate attempt to make himself feel better.

It's a great story, a great movie, and ultimately a sad tale that relates to the real world.

The actors each bring a measured amount of understated sophistication to their roles.

From Andrew Garfield to Justin Timberlake, from Rashida Jones to Rooney Mara, and even Joe Mazzello (""The Pacific"" as well as being the little boy in ""Jurassic Park""), the performances were pitch-perfect.

On Blu-Ray, the colors and editing shine even more brightly and allow deeper appreciation.  Both commentaries (one with cast, one with Fincher & Sorkin) are both worth watching as well.  The Sorkin/Fincher one gets a little dry and detail-drowning at times, but anyone who appreciates filmmaking will appreciate the discussion of the trade.  There is also a discussion of the whole ""playing an actual person"" aspect of Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.  I think this goes a long way to simply file away the argument of how ""accurate"" the movie is.  They truly strive to portray Mark Zuckerberg as simply a character, rather than it being a completely factual documentary.

Clearly, I had heard of Mark Zuckerburg's name before, but what I did not realize was how much drama was really involved. His peers ended up suing him for taking their ideas without giving due credit, and Zuckerburg was a truly unpleasant, self-centered man.

Of course, you would have to take everything in the movie with a grain of salt. The movie is based on a book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accidental-Billionaires-The-Founding-of-Facebook-A-Tale-of-Sex-Money-Genius-and-Betrayal/dp/0307740986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal</a>, which in turn is based on alleged conversations that occurred regarding the development of Facebook. The author of that book did not interview everyone, not even Mark Zuckerburg, so you can't automatically believe everything presented to you in this movie. But whether the facts in the film are true or not, the film itself is pretty enjoyable. The actors play their lines well, and if you like sarcastic humor, you should love this movie because there is a lot of it.

At some moments I feel like the film moves a little too slowly and becomes boring, but it should still keep up the attention of most people throughout the time. Do see it if you want to to know the history of Facebook.",1305158400,,1632,5.421259842519685
4067431,3,B0034G4P7Q,"Actually, I really liked this film right up to the end.  The acting was wonderful, the dialogue snappy, and the characters well drawn.  There was the tension of wondering how the lawsuit would turn out (OK, I admit it, I'm one of three people in the US who didn't already know), the drama of friendship betrayed, and some very nice comic relief provided by the Winklevoss twins.

And then it ended. I felt like Steve Martin looking down at his plate in LA Story and commenting, ""I'm done already and I don't remember eating."" Or, in less culinary terms, while I was waiting for something to happen, nothing happened.  Sure, Mark Zuckerberg ended up forking over $65 million to the Sons of Thor, but with $16 BILLION at his disposal, that wasn't even a slap on the wrist.

The problem with this film, and other movies that are based on actual people, is that the story the writers devise is never as interesting as the real thing. The only motivations that film writers seem to understand are sex and money. So, if someone does something extraordinary for any other reason, real life is adjusted until it fits into their limited sphere of knowledge. In the end, the complexity and mystery that surround the question, ""Why did he do that?"" is lost.

Mark Zuckerberg did not invent Facebook because he was a social failure aching to get back at the more popular (and less Jewish) Harvard students.  He invented Facebook because 1)he is a computer genius, 2) he realized that the main function of college is to socialize and, 3)he could. Doing something simply because you can is a huge motivating factor for people who are brilliant.  (Clifford Irving, author of The Hoax, pulled off the biggest literary hoax of the century, not for love, or money, but simply because he could.) I wish Sorkin had explored that concept a little more instead of leaving us with the trite, and completely hackneyed concept of ""Unpopular kid betrays friends and ends up rich but lonely."" Trust me, right now Mark Zuckerberg is not sitting alone in an empty room clicking on Erica Albright's Facebook page over and over and over again.",1304640000,14,2112,4.7046070460704605

He searches the databases that contain pictures of people to gather them into one location. A harmless pastime? [Appropriating other's work or an invasion of privacy?] The activity takes advantage of a human flaw: the need for attention. The high traffic causes a network crash (too many users for a limited space). Does Mark have a sense of humor? Two brothers, wealthy heirs who row crew, want to talk with him. They have an idea for a web site. [The film begins to switch scenes, disturbing the flow of the story.] The idea of a web site where people could advertise to access their friends seems appealing.

Erica tells him ""good luck with your video game""! They will expand to cover other colleges. [No permission?] Does Mark violate Harvard's Law? Entrepreneur or unemployed? [Was President Lawrence Summers really like that? A stuffed shirt? Was he later forced to resign?] Mark and Eduardo went to New York to visits an investor, and Shaun Parker. Shaun warned them about what happened to him. [Would anyone hire a private investigator to learn about him?] Could someone plant an article to embarrass Eduardo for a commercial advantage?

There is a contest in hacking computer systems. The winners are hired for Facebook. We hear a story about the invention of ""Victoria's Secret"". A parable? The Winklevoss twins are in the Thames Regatta. ""Do you have `Facebook' in America?"" They will sue in Federal Court. Eduardo flies from New York to learn what's happening behind his back. As CFO he controls the money. Mark finds investors in San Francisco. Peter Thiel invested $500,000 in the company. ""We did it!"" Was Eduardo cheated in this deal?

The Winklevoss twins received $65 million in their settlement (for their idea). Eduardo Saverin received a settlement and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead. Facebook has 500 million members in 207 countries. The shares are currently valued at $25 billion. Is it recession and inflation proof?

The movie focuses on a friendship that is quite tragically broken by ambition, the inexperience of youth, and dog-eat-dog nature of modern financial capitalism. Facebook was created by an antisocial guy who is smart as a whip, has no friends, and is desperate for recognition and acceptance.  The movie definitely portrays Zuckerburg as a selfish jerk, but allows both sides to present their views and lets the audience decide who is at fault. The movie has smart dialogue, brilliant acting (the portrayal of Zuckerburg as an asocial, self-absorbed jerk is brilliant) , and fantastic directing.

What is at stake in TSN? here is a matter of some millions due the ""true"" creators of Facebook...a question of authorship, I believe? And the super rich guy might lose a little of his riches to some other super rich guys. And it's a matter of pride, I believe? Honor at stake? Something like that...who cares? It's the MacGuffin. Doesn't matter. So..what is at stake? Zuckerberg's humanity? His...ability to exist in a true community? A real relationship?

What is at stake for this socially retarded college kid with no friends? Is his mortal soul at stake? Might he crack and go on an Ivy League shooting rampage? I'd even take a ""get the girl,"" if...the character ever seemed like he wanted the girl or deserved the girl.

Spiritual emptiness may be a real stake in a Fellini film, but there is not one scene in TSN, not one line of dialogue, not a whisper of any existential reality beyond the glowing screen, the ivy-ensconced walls, the pulse of the club.

Imagine if Michel Gondry writes/directs this story. What fun! Or you want to camp out in the existential angst aspects? Go with Alejandro Gonzlez Irritu. Or why not Neill Blomkamp or Peter Jackson? It's a technology story, let's let the tech guys handle it. Let them love it into existence.

Sorkin can't write real stakes. He doesn't do heart and soul. He does ambition and wonky political minutiae...the kind of small-room doings of men who think their brains are the uttermost reaches of the universe.

Ultimately, TSN fails because...well, see the famous trailer for the film. A children's choir singing Radiohead's ""Creep."" When I saw it I was mesmerized. Until...I watched it again. And again...and...oh crap. This...this trailer...it's the movie! Watch that trailer again. It's the best short film you may ever see.

4067438,4,B0034G4P7Q,"THE SOCIAL NETWORK is nonlinear but still always makes sense, which is trickier than it looks. I'm not sure if it's really ""the best movie of the year"" -- it's actually a small story, for all of the billions Zuckerberg was eventually worth, since it's just about how one guy had an idea and pursued it even when that meant screwing over all of his friends and acquaintances -- but it's certainly a good movie, which is definitely something.

I should back up slightly, for coherency's sake: THE SOCIAL NETWORK is the story of Mark Zuckerberg, who founded the social networking Internet site Facebook.com, and is currently worth north of a dozen billion dollars. In the time-honored way of tech pioneers, Zuckerberg founded Facebook while he was still an undergraduate (at Harvard -- the other time-honored part of the equation is that the pioneer must be a privileged over-achiever to begin with) about seven years ago, and the movie runs through roughly the first year of Facebook, from the night Zuckerberg threw up a ""rate the girls of Harvard"" site called Facemash.com to get back at the girlfriend who just dumped him to the point where he'd driven out, locked out, outmaneuvered, or alienated all of the people who had helped get Facebook started.

Of course, that's this movie's angle; presumably Zuckerberg himself would have a different story. SOCIAL NETWORK is based very heavily on the depositions from two suits brought against Zuckerberg: one from his former best friend and the original ""outside man"" for Facebook, and one from a pair of vastly more overprivileged twin rowers, who seem like a gift from heaven to make Zuckerberg seem more likable in comparison with their endless smug rich-prep pose of superiority. SOCIAL NETWORK keeps looping back to those two deposition sessions, presumably because the events of them are legally guaranteed, but that keeps framing this as a story about money, when it should be a movie about connection. It is, more or less, but it could have been more visually inventive -- it's an old-fashioned, plodding sort of movie to look at, for all its zippy modern subject matter -- and could have either focused more tightly on what Facebook was -- why it was so successful, so quickly -- or on Zuckerberg himself. As it is, SOCIAL NETWORK has a bundle of good performances circling the enigma of Mark Zuckerberg, and it raises a whole lot of questions and thoughts that it isn't sure how to address.",1303516800,,2447,4.865707434052758

I realize that you don't have to ""root"" for characters, but Zuckerberg is so repellent, it was difficult to get involved.  He treated others so poorly that it was really disappointing to see him become successful in the end (although obviously I knew that going in).

4067442,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Rating: PG-13 - contains some strong language, and some sensuality.

Overview:

This movie covers the story of the creation the Facebook web site. The Screenplay is simply brilliant as it takes you the various hearings that Mark Zuckerberg had to attend, firstly for his exploits at Facemash, and then with the Winklevoss Twins and also with his former best friend, Eduardo Saverin.

Background:

This movie is based on the book: The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal (2009) by Ben Mezrich. Both Zuckerberg and Sean Parker (played by Justin Timberlake) strongly challenge the accuracy events portrayed in the film. While the overall concepts may have some truth to them, they have been embellished so as to make it more exciting and entertaining. Everything unfolded in a much more mundane manner.

Zuckerberg:

There is no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, while in Middle school his father taught him Atari Basic programming and as he progressed, a private tutor was hired to assist in his development. Zuckerberg has listed as non-English languages he could read and write: French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He is also skilled at fencing.

Value of an Idea:

For me the value of this film is that it shows what is possible when a person's talents are identified at an early age and properly channeled. In my opinion, Mark's father is the real hero here, for doing just that for Mark.",1303084800,,1458,4.94672131147541
4067443,4,B0034G4P7Q,"It took me a while to finally get around to watching The Social Network. It's award nominated and the critics mostly loved it. So what took me so long? Well, watching how Facebook got started just didn't seem that compelling to me, but ultimately the movie was fascinating.

Jesse Eisenberg is a great pick to play Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Whether or not the portrayal is accurate I have no idea. But as far as I'm concerned, by the end of the movie I felt like I knew Zuckerberg personally and I felt like I tagged along with him while he went from Harvard genius to Facebook Founder & CEO. Kudos to Director David Fincher as well for taking a potential bore fest and turning out one of the best movies that I've seen this year.

I think a common misconception is that guys like Zuckerberg are ""lucky"". As in, ""Man, why didn't I think of Facebook"" lucky. Like if you thought of it first you'd be a billionaire. If you had any illusions (or should I say delusions) that simply coming up with the idea first would have made you rich, you will not be so confident after watching this movie. Zuckerberg was/is a computer savvy, cut-throat entrepreneur that makes Donald Trump look obsolete.

I had no idea that one of the creators of Napster was involved in making Facebook succeed. However, while Shawn Fanning is renowned as THE Napster creator, he is not the character played by Justin Timberlake in the movie. Timberlake plays Sean Parker who indeed was one of the Napster pioneers along with Fanning. So just in case you were wondering, there's my trivia moment for this review.

When they are not doing bong hits, they are using that 176 IQ and software to create contests of ""which chick is hotter"" (gee, and when I was in college in the Midwest, I was reading Socrates and Nietzsche and T.S.

Then we have more inane software contests, culminating in Larry Sommers being very university and stating that the university will take the easy way out, and not take sides.

4067448,4,B0034G4P7Q,"Finally got to see it on blu-ray, really good film. For a movie about someone creating a popular website its a pretty nuanced experiment. Eisenberg's Zuckerberg was a pretty good ahole, a layered ahole, you could feel his anxiety, his uneasiness around people and his frustration with people specially when they disagreed with him. Almost like a robot he reacts only to logic. Timberlake on the other hand was a Cameron's villain, serviceable yes but one dimensional. Garfield's Saverin brings a little humanity into the mix which was refreshing. When he confronts Zuckerberg about his settlement and Parker starts mocking him like a little girl ""look I got your candy"" I really wanted to punch him in the face and suddenly I realized I had my fist raised as if I was ready to start a fight I guess that goes to show how involving the movie is or how much i dislike Timberlake in any scenario its a pretty good accomplishment.
All around the acting was pretty good even the Winklevoss brothers which could have easily been throwaway characters were played very distinctly by Hammer.

The irony in the final scene was brilliant that the guy who created the most popular form of social networking is in real life socially inept and is not even fb friends with the girl who inspired him to create the website in first place. Of course that doesn't mean that the real Zuckerberg is like that, but it serves for compelling storytelling.

Which goes to my second point by looking at the trailer with the cool A-Capella version of Creep it kinda looked like it was going to be a little more of that social commentary on how the digital age social networking experience completely sheds light on our shallowness, arrogance and impotence. But this was more about the legal tribulations of the creating parties which is still pretty interesting but not as big of a scope as I hoped. But yeah I know that's my fault. I saw the trailer of Spider-Man 3 and I thought it was going to be the most awesome-o movie ever but then it wasn't...

In the end I really enjoyed it, a lot of back stabbing, smart quick remarks, a psycho pyromaniac girlfriend and you can even conclude the final statement was ""gaining the world at the cost of your soul and friendship""  but then I dunno if movie Zuckerberg had a soul to being with.

4067449,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network is a breakneck paced drama about the genesis and evolution of Facebook and the people who were elevated to iconic status (namely Mark Zuckerberg) and those who were betrayed and left behind in the process.  Yet it is so multifacted and complex that it actually benefits from repeat viewings not only to appreciate the accomplishments of the creative team involved, but also to absorb the full scope of the tragedy that lies beneath its ultra sleek surface.

When I first viewed The Social Network, it was hard to ignore the nearly deafening critical acclaim that the film was being met with.  Not only was it being hailed as the film of the year, but it was also being referred to as the film of the decade and a movie that defined a generation.  It was going to be quite difficult for any movie to live up to those unfair expectatiions.  Still, I was impressed with the film on my first viewing.  David Fincher's direction had an almost clinical precision to it.  Trent Reznor's score seemed to capture the tone of the film perfectly.  The performances were superb, particularly Jesse Eisenberg, who absolutely nailed the narcassistic persona of the Facebook founder.  And of course Aaron Sorkin's screenplay was smart, scathing and funny all at the same time.  The Social Network was an unflinching and unsentimental account of the rise of the Facebook empire and the friendships that were destroyed in the process.  Yet for all of its technical saavy and zeitgeist qualities, the movie left me feeling a bit cold.  It was a movie that was easier to respect than to love.

But then I watched it a second time and was blown away by all of the subtleties I had missed the first time around--not just in the machine gun fire pacing of Sorkin's dialogue but in the nuances of the characters as well.  Zuckerberg, for example, is not driven by mere greed to create Facebook but rather from a deep rooted sense of insecurity.  He is driven by the need for recognition and to be the first person to revolutionize social networking.  He also seems to be full of a sese of self hatred that stems not only from his own insecurities but also from his mistreatment of the people who matter the most to him.  Most notable are his girlfriend who he breaks up with at the film's beginning and his best friend and business partner (Andrew Garfield) who gets left out in the cold when Facebook becomes bigger than anyone expected.  In order to hide the disgust he feels with himself, Zuckerberg plays the role of an arrogant, power hungry jerk that nobody is capable of liking.  He seems incapable of, or unwilling to understand why he is all alone atop his self-created empire.  Again, much praise goes to Eisenberg for capturing all of these facets of Zuckergerg while effortlessly handling Sorkin's high octane dialogue.

The closing scene of The Social Network is a stinging statement on just how alone Mark Zuckerberg truly is despite the fact that he has created the most popular social networking website ever seen.  To paraprhase one of his attorneys in the closing scene, he's not a jerk--he's just trying hard to be one.  It is that quality of Zuckerberg's extremely fragile persona that drives his every action and leaves him alone in the end.  It is also what gives this smart and insightful story of success and betrayal a much needed soul.",1302652800,,3357,4.708904109589041

Most successful biopics are of royalty, like The King's Speech, military leaders (Patton, Lawrence of Arabia), political leaders (Gandhi), or celebrities (Frida, Babe, Capote).  But a successful movie based on a techno geek is rare.  Even movies like Tucker and The Right Stuff showed the nerds in heroic form.  But here is a movie about a socially inept, brainy, and emotionally incomplete person who strikes gold with people, while striking out with the people around him.

4067454,3,B0034G4P7Q,"I've been looking forward to finally getting around to watching this movie for a long while. I thought it'd be right up my alley - I'm all about geek-dom and such.

To be honest, I watched this movie over a period of 3 evenings in short spurts. I don't know if my reaction to the movie is all thanks to not watching it in one fell-swoop, but I only thought it to be okay. It was a little lackluster and the plot was a little open-ended, which, I'd think, is somewhat to be expected with a subject such as this. It seemed unfinished and didn't really have much of a climax. There wasn't much to keep my interest - nothing exciting.

All in all, I think the only thing I came away with was the knowledge that Mark Zuckerberg was pretty much not a nice fellow. By the end, he was a tiny bit redeemable, but not enough for me to root for him as the hero.

One great note, however, was the acting. The leads were very well cast and, for the most part, they were a delight to watch.

4067455,5,B0034G4P7Q,"This was much better than I expected it to be (I expected it -- like Zuckerberg himself -- to be annoying!) It's true, for the first half an hour or so (as you acclimatise to the Harvard setting, and Zuckerberg's petty hostility toward (and inability to interact with) the social side of campus life) it is as annoying as expected, but you do get involved and it does become a great film.

Everything is very well shot: the campus atmosphere captured perfectly and the acting is first rate (especially Andrew Garfield as -- the only character who is really likeable -- Eduardo Saverin). It doesn't really follow a standard plot -- the story of how Facebook was founded (and how quickly it became a global success) is interspersed with two subsequent lawsuits against Zuckerberg -- though it is simple enough to follow. I think the main reason this works (as others have mentioned -- as well as the excellent direction by Fincher) is that Zuckerberg (and most of his peers) are portrayed as being just as irresponsible and foolish as you expect them to be! This isn't the story of how a genius founded a global empire, but of how someone with little social skills managed (through a combination of hard work, other peoples ideas (largely stolen) and sheer luck) managed to revolutionise the Social Networking phenomenon. It portrays him as a dedicated professional and programming genius, but with little charisma or morality. If it had tried to idolise him, then it would probably have lost me early on; as I say, after the first 30 minutes, I was totally riveted.

It's not necessarily something you will watch often, but you will be glad you watched. In a nuthsell: you'll probably enjoy it much more and it will irritate you much less than you thought it would.

The red and white envelope held a ticket that would allow me to go to places I had never been before. I had indulged for a low monthly rate of unlimited transportation to magical kingdoms; time travel to the Wild West; the opportunity to wine and dine with kings and queens and sleep in alleys and dine on pork and beans. There are some trips that I wish I had never taken and this was one of them.

The trip was back to 2004 to Cambridge, Mass., to hang out at Harvard University with Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook. The red and white envelope held the movie, ""The Social Network,"" sent to me by Netflix.

I had wanted to see the movie for a while and I finally got to this past Saturday. The movie was well-written and the actors did great jobs in their portrayals, particularly if everyone in there were jerks, especially Zuckerberg.

In a minor role in the movie, Brenda Song does a great job portraying the girlfriend of Facebook co-founder, Eduardo Saverin, played by Andrew Garfield. In a fit of jealous rage, Song puts a wastebasket on Saverin's bed and sets a scarf that he bought her ablaze.

The only likable character in the movie is Saverin. Garfield evokes our sympathy for Saverin and makes us despise Zuckerberg. In one of the movie's scenes, Saverin is suing Zuckerberg when Zuckerberg's lawyer asks Saverin about charges of animal cruelty. It seems that Saverin had been accused of animal cruelty during an initiation into an exclusive club. Saverin had to carry a chicken with him everywhere he went and he is at a dinner party, where chicken is being served, so he gives the chicken tiny bits of chicken to eat. This causes him to be accused of forcing cannibalism on the chicken. The animal rights groups are in an uproar at Saverin.

In the late 80s and early 90s, I worked at a hatchery owned by the Cherry family in Lee, Fla. The egg shells, discarded (read ""dead"") chicks and yolks would be sent to the feed mill over in Live Oak to be made into chicken feed, so I guess that would be forcing chickens to be cannibals also.

The least likeable character in The Social Network is Zuckerberg. Portrayed by Jesse Eisenberg, the Facebook co-founder has no redeeming values.

In the end, the whole movie seemed more or less a hatchet job on Zuckerberg. I don't know the true story of what really happened in the formation of Facebook and I probably never will. Internet sources are full of contradicting statements. In the end, I guess that Zuckerberg is laughing all the way to the bank.

This film chart Facebooks inception, its growth and the legal wrangling over it's ownership.  Zuckerberg comes across as a narcissistic, arrogant, socially inept misfit, but also someone who happens to be extremely clever and able to take a basic idea and run with it.  You see how he alienates all those around him, as well as betray those who believed in him and gave him ideas and support.  It is quite sad to see and leaves a mild distaste in your mouth when you next go to logon to your Facebook account.  You also feel slight pity for him and you have at least some understanding of what drives him and why he behaves the way he does.

This is acted well by all involved and Timberlake is a particular surprise as the cocky, self assured Sean Parker.  It is also directed very well and the muted colours and dark lighting add a certain atmosphere to the proceedings.  I was pleasantly surprised how interesting this was for the duration and what could be a rather staid and uninspired story is portrayed in an interesting and entertaining way.  I credit Sorkin with a great deal of this success.

It seems like hours of monologue with a dash of dialog thrown in. As the ending credits roll up you realize that all he did was talk and talk and talk.

Of course if you like long boring conversations this is a great movie and a perfect representation of one great big long diatribe that starts from nowhere and goes to nowhere. On the positive side the music was nice and the period costumes were up to acceptable.

I only saw the Blu-ray.  I'm not sure they made anything other than Blu-ray.

However, the performances and gut wrenching irony of the story behind how Mark Zuckerberg's Internet empire was created in the ""mean streets"" of Harvard (where pretension and douchebaggery are as common among the students as brilliance and creativity) only make this filmgoing experience that much more layered and enjoyable.

This film was well deserving of its Oscar nominations, and Sorkin won a well deserved Oscar for the writing as did Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross for their excellent film score.

The audiocommentaries are a bit disappointing as I was hoping more from Sorkin about his research and what was elaborated upon or dramatized in the script versus what was ""factual,"" alas, there was none of that. However, what it does have are excellent mini-docs on the post-production processes of scoring, sound mixing, and editing. There is also a nearly two hour documentary on the making of the film, which is separated into four parts.

4067501,4,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network"" pushes boundaries between communication, both good and bad -- right and wrong -- light and dark. Some stories about corruption are sometimes poorly executed, but ""Network"" does not skimp on the amazing story about how two friends became enemies, over a little thing called Facebook.

Mark Zuckerberg -- menace, geek, traitor (well, at least according to the DVD cover) -- is in Harvard; yes, he's trying to come up with the next big idea, but he can't. He doesn't have a lot of friends, he's arrogant, single, and his ego is as big as the Sun and Moon combined. This, unfortunately, slows down his momentum. However, one night, when intoxicated and recently dumped, Zuck creates a website dedicated to Erica Albright (his ex), comparing her and other girls on a hotness ratio. Not only does he embarrasses her through Facemash.com (the comparision site), he ruins her reputation at her college by calling her a 'bitch' on his popular blog, in addition to correcting her bra size and her family name.

See how vindictive boys can be? But Mark doesn't stop there!

With the help from a few of his programming friends and his best mate Eduardo Saverin, he creates theFacebook, a site dedicated to Harvard students who are looking to connect with their peers easier.

But wait, there's more! Not only did Mark steal the idea from three other students at Harvard -- who wanted to help him restore his new-found badass image with Facemash.com by helping them with Harvard Connection (a dating site for Harvard students) -- he also dupes his friend Eduardo into helping him expand the site. Not only does Mark expand, he begins to piss a lot of people off, including Eduardo, who has his own plans for Facebook.

Brilliant movie, excellent cast, terrific score, awesome cinematography. Not only does ""The Social Network"" pushes buttons, it shows you how some things in life aren't fair -- at all. So you must fight the battle that comes along with it.

Starring Jesse Eisenberg as Mark, Andrew Garfield as Eduardo, Justin Timberlake as Sean, Brenda Song as Christie, Armie Hammer as Cameron and Tyler, Max Minghella as Divya, Rashida Jones as Marylin, Joseph Mazzello as Dustin, and Rooney Mara as Erica.

The film won three Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing.

I agree with another reviewer.....this movie could have been so much better if they went after more of the ""real story"" rather than making up half of it. Another thing was that the drinking and goofing off was way over-acted, making you think this was nothing more than a bunch of drinking and laughing stunts gone good.

The pasty faced fools who have somehow become the hero ideals of our generation are seen leaping about with Oriental 'hos of one type or another, while ""the adults"" all appear bored out of their mind. Most strange of all is the music, which is often so loud (obviously to make up for the lack of drama) that is actually drowns out the dialogue!

4067511,5,B0034G4P7Q,"So many times we hear about a great film and how it's the best thing ever! Only to be left so disappointed by yet another over rated movie, however The Social Network does not fall into that category, because yes the critics praise has been worthy, The Social Network is one of the best films to come along in quite a while!

The first thing to say is that this is not a film about Facebook, yes its based around its creators Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin, but what it really is about is how their invention came between their friendship. The way the film is set up works really well as far as story telling goes, Mark Zuckerberg played by the brilliant Jesse Eisenberg is involved in 2 cases at once, one involving co creator Eduardo Saverin played by Andrew Garfield and the other case involves Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss who claim they asked Zuckerberg to design a social networking site for Harvard and claim that Zuckerberg took their idea. Eduard Saverin is also involved in that case.

It says alot for a movie that features a lot of dialogue that The Social Network never becomes confusing, boring or hard to follow. This is helped brilliantly by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross amazing score for the film. Director David Fincher(seven, fight club, zodiac) really brings out the best in all the scenes and to listen to his commentary on the film is amazing.

The Blu Ray comes packed with extras such as Fincher's Commentary as well as screenplay writer Aaron Sorkin along with the cast. On disc 2 there's a brilliant feature called How Did They Ever Make A Movie of Facebook? Its over one and half hours long and shows a great insight on how they made the movie including the difficulties that they had to over come, it also show what a great director Fincher is. It shows him and Sorkin discussing what they think would work better in different scenes. You also get Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross talking about the creation of the award winning score and how tough it was to recreate ""In The Hall Of The Mountain"" for the famous Henley Royal Regatta scene, they include two versions, one that made the movie and an earlier version that didn't.

The Social Network is a film you will come back to watch more than once, it features a great cast even Justin Timberlake playing Napster Founder Sean Parker plays his role very well.

""Facebook"" 1/24/11
by Rachel Mangieri

'It all cascading into technology, the complexities of being until you must come down, you MUST come down to relax, step down to my world, tune into the colors, all every little freaking coincidence of all the people we know and love ON FACEBOOK all is happening ON FACEBOOK not ""the"" Facebook but Facebook, with all its problems and complaints and saying ""Oh screw that Facebook movie, that's so stupid, I don't want to see that"" exactly like that, I'm unable to believe the feeling distilled from this movie, ""The Social Network,"" the movie that shifts lives that introduces you to the ""Time Magazine"" 2010 person of the year MARK ZUCKERBERG, the CONNECTOR the man (boy?) who connected one tenth of the world's population in seven years, the magic number, seven and three, my lucky numbers, being a Cancer (if you want to talk astrology, something I am far too involved with). Facebook, the wide open plane of offices, no cubicles, no offices, not even the creator HIMSELF has an office, the ""Facebook CEO, Bitch"" business card holder, the place where they hold meetings in Palo Alto, the conference room, a glass box in the midst of this huge, huge array of computers all updating posting linking chaining our soul, Mark Zuckerberg is BUDDHIST, caring, he just cares. When he and his friends were sitting around, thinking about Facebook, the connective tissue, they thought; why hasn't anyone done this before. The internet held the possibility, the capability of the connection of nearly 600 million people. Mark says, ""The craziest thing to me in all this is that I can remember having these conversations with my friends when I was in college. We would just sort of take it as an assumption that the world would get to the state it is now. But, we figured, we're just college kids. Why were we the people who were most qualified to do that? I mean, that's crazy!"" he goes on. As time magazine says, ""We have entered the Facebook age, and Mark Zuckerberg is the man who brought us here."" Mark Zuckerberg was born in 1984, the same year that the first Macintosh computer came out. This makes him 26 years old as of the beginning of 2011. Mark had a star-wars themed bar mitzvah. He is a ""precocious computer programmer."" Now Wikipedia bills him as ""an American Computer scientist, software developer, and philanthropist best known for creating the social networking site Facebook, of which he is CEO and president.

Mark Zuckerberg. The ""inventor"" of Facebook. Making stuff happen. Every day writing code for his creation, never giving up.

4067514,4,B0034G4P7Q,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Aaron's Sorkin's screenplay, based on the 2009 non-fiction book 'The Accidental Billionaires', attempts to turn Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, into the 'Citizen Kane' of the computer generation. Like 'Kane', it's the chronicle of the rise of a boy genius to the heights of power, who is a dogged by a character flaw. The question in both films is whether each of the protagonists truly has an 'Achilles heel' that tarnishes their legacy or is it some sort of unconscious jealousy on the part of the films' scenarists who seek to drag these boy wonders down from their high perch in order to take them down a peg or two in the public eye?

As an only occasional user of Facebook, I hold no implicit disdain for the social networking site that Mark Zuckerberg created. I've noticed that some internet posters hate Facebook so much that they refuse to be objective about the film. If they were honest, they would recognize that the material the film is based on, is difficult to make into a compelling film. 'The Social Network' IS dry material and veteran director David Fincher has managed to turn this story into something that moves along at a fairly brisk pace. I also wonder why some posters find the subject matter, not to be worthy enough to be made into a feature length film. Certainly the way in which Zuckerberg rises to the top as the world's youngest billionaire, to my mind, is a compelling enough subject to merit the attention of the average film goer.

Sorkin's technique is to tell Zuckerberg's story as a double flashback: the two alternating depositions in which a bored looking Zuckerberg must give testimony at. First is the Winklevoss brothers' lawsuit, fellow students at Harvard who claimed Zuckerberg ripped off their original idea for a Facebook-like platform. The other lawsuit is instituted at the behest of Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former friend, who provided some small start-up capital in the early days of their business venture together.

While I was overjoyed that Jesse Eisenberg finally got to play a role where he wasn't a geeky good guy, as 'The Social Network' moves along, his performance as Mark Zuckerberg becomes a bit one-note. It's really not Eisenberg's fault since the script calls for him to play Zuckerberg as both the manic overachiever and sullen bad boy who basically remains the same throughout the narrative (the real Zuckerberg doesn't see himself worthy as a dramatic character--he's quoted as saying, in substance, that he spent most of his time writing computer code during those heady days). A bit more interesting is Eduardo (Andrew Garfield) who gets to emote a lot more, especially after he discovers that his best friend and partner has ripped him off royally! (Garfield's Eduardo also collects a few laughs when he attempts to deal with a girlfriend who will not change her mind about dumping him).

What 'The Social Network' really comes down to is our verdict on Zuckerberg's moral character. And in my opinion, that verdict must be a mixed one. Certainly, the Winklevoss part of the lawsuit seemed to me to be without merit. In the end, we find out they prevailed to the tune of $65 million but did Zuckerberg really copy any of their ideas? They may have had the same concept but web pages are all in the details--and it was Zuckerberg who came up with all the unique ideas. As for Saverin, Zuckerberg probably would not have become successful if he took the cautious advice of his business partner. By seeking out the wild and unpredictable Napster founder Sean Parker (who Saverin couldn't stomach at all), Zuckerberg found a partner who truly had the connections to make things happen. Nonetheless, the way in which Zuckerberg and his new business associates 'tricked' Saverin, was reprehensible. Saverin counted Zuckerberg as a friend and Zuckerberg took advantage of this fact because he knew Saverin would never read the fine print of the contract he was signing. Zuckerberg was right about one thing: Saverin, as a successful Harvard business student, should have read the fine print and hired an attorney to go over the contract he was about to sign.

In Citizen Kane, Orson Welles offers up the image of 'Rosebud', a childhood keepsake which symbolized the loss of love for the film's protagonist. Here, in 'The Social Network', Sorkin serves up Zuckerberg's 'Rosebud' as something much more mundane: a college sweetheart who rejected him. The audience gets to have their 'Rosebud' moment when Zuckerberg tries to send a Facebook friend request to his lost love. In an earlier scene in a restaurant, Zuckerberg can't bring himself to apologize for his crude blogging when he was a student at Harvard, and ends up begging his ex to join him in a private tete-a-tete where presumably he'll try to rationalize his behavior once again. It's a long stretch to suggest that Zuckerberg's occasional sour disposition is all due to his rejection by an ex-girlfriend. The implication is that this is the one thing Zuckerberg can't have--and it consumes him (just as Kane/Hearst pines for the lack of love in his childhood).

'The Social Network' is no masterpiece as some have maintained here on the internet. It's really a workmanlike story chronicling the machinations of a driven overachiever who becomes insanely successful in our new computer age. Mark Zuckerberg's story is certainly worth watching at least once. If I do see this film again, I'll be sure to concentrate on the technical aspects since I'm quite satisfied that I've already absorbed most of the major plot points and internal/external arcs of the principal characters.",1298937600,,5657,4.954689146469969
4067515,3,B0034G4P7Q,"Aaron Sorkin won an Academy Award for his adapted screenplay for ""The Social Network"", which takes inspiration from Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Millionaire"", an agenda-driven account of the creation of the world's most popular social networking web site: Facebook. Director David Fincher brings his dark palette and perfectionism to the story, which begins in the fall of 2003 on the campus of Harvard University. Sophomore Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) hacks the web sites of student houses in search of photos of female undergrads, which he then uses to create a face book where students can vote on who is hotter. Charming. That prank attracted the attention of a pair of blue-blooded identical twin jocks, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer), who solicit Zuckerberg's help in building a social networking site for Harvard.

""The Social Network"" uses the subsequent lawsuits against Zuckerberg by the Winklevoss brothers, their business partner Divvya Narendra (Max Minghella), and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) to follow the creation of the web site until its millionth member. There is not much to this story. Facebook was created by a bunch of guys sitting in front of their laptops for days on end...coding. The lawsuits allow the film to jump around in time in order to keep the audience engaged. I have to give David Fincher credit for doing the best job yet at making typing and staring at a computer monitor interesting. The non-linear narrative helps. But mostly Fincher accomplishes this through fictionalizing the history of Facebook.

There is a lot of cross-cutting to scantily-clad young women at various raucous parties. It helps that Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) of Napster fame is in the mix as one of Facebook's early advisors. He was forced to leave the company after a cocaine bust. ""The Social Network"" is a creation myth. I don't object to that in itself. It's an entertaining movie. I was amazed by how fast the 2 hours flew by, especially since nothing much happened. But a movie about the creation of one of the internet age's most influential social instruments needs to either give us the facts for the historical record or say something intelligent about the implications of this open global community. Barring that, it could at least provide an accurate representation of the personalities involved.

""The Social Network"" doesn't attempt any of those things. It doesn't have any ambition. It's a showcase of impressive craftsmanship without substance. Mark Zuckerberg seems like an upbeat person in interviews and comments by his friends. He's brooding and sullen in the movie. Not only does the film fabricate a lot of narrative, it omits too many of the details of Saverin's ouster from the company and of Zuckerberg's less savory activities. No one comes out looking good, but that's not because the film is critical; it's just because everyone is obnoxious. I came away from ""The Social Network"" impressed by the editing and struck by how unambitious the film was. Not sure why the Academy awarded an Oscar for such a dull, shallow screenplay.",1298937600,4,3125,5.135559921414538

She was the contrast of the Erica Albright character and was nearly the ""2nd girl"" in his life after he got dumped in the opening scene. In a way, both girls are right about him. The difference is the lawyer girl wasn't dating him and gave him the benefit of the doubt.

As he was continuing to hit refresh on Erica Albright's personal page, it was interesting to see someone who had become so powerful be so anxious about whether his ex-girlfriend would accept him as a friend on his own website. Many of us have wondered if we really should try to add certain people from the past because we are unsure of whether that person still wants us in their life even if it is only FB.

Mark is vulnerable in only 3 scenes and they all have to do with his former love interest whom he can't impress because of his classist and arrogant personality.

The final scene makes me wonder if he would have been happier just being a normal Harvard student without the Facebook site and dating a cute BU undergrad. In some ways, that might have been worth more.",1298937600,,1250,4.31063829787234

I can't let the Oscars come and go without seeing at least one nominated movie so I watched The Social Network. I thought this was an entertaining movie only because of Aaron Sorkin's dialogue. Without that, I don't think I would have been impressed with the movie at all. I haven't read anything about Mark Zuckerberg and I was surprised to learn what a jerk he was (is?). However, I don't know how factual the source material (The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal by Ben Mezrich) is. My understanding is that Zuckerberg had nothing to do with the book so, unfortunately, we're hearing only one side of the story and like the old saying goes, ""Until the lion learns to speak, the tales of hunting will always favor the hunter"". The Social Network was an entertaining movie, brilliantly written, well directed and acted, but it didn't make me feel any better about wasting time on Facebook, or make me want to rush back to my Facebook account. I'm not sure the movie would have been nominated for Best Picture if the Oscar field were moved back to only five nominees.

4067531,5,B0034G4P7Q,"As a chronicle of events leading to the creation of the social networking site Facebook, touching nearly every computer user in the world, The Social Network is a fascinating take on Mark Zuckerberg, a maverick, whose brilliant mind is matched by his arrogance.  Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, The Fight Club) from an excellent screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The West Wing) and based on the book, The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, this is a fascinating study of a success story complete with intrigue and subterfuge.  In this case, the incidents play on a very human level.  You would think this would make an excellent made for television HBO movie, but Sorkin and Fincher have created a remarkable, cinematic vision of an inventor, albeit a troubled one.

In the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is portrayed as a computer genius at Harvard University with few social graces.  What we know now as Facebook had its modest beginnings as a response to a failed relationship with a girl.  Needing to vent some anger, Mark modifies a campus website and with the help of his buddy, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), a concept is born for socializing on the internet.  When web traffic to the site spikes to record numbers, people begin to take notice, and a phenomenon is born. A group of Harvard students enlist Mark to develop his site with their financial backing, but when they discover that he is working on his venture without them, they become incensed and contemplate legal action.  Mark and Eduardo become popular `rock stars' on campus as the new Facebook spreads like an epidemic to other college campuses like Yale, Columbia, and Stanford.  Soon, the company approaches critical mass and the milestone of being able to monetize the site and turn a profit.  Napster creator, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), reaches out to the growing network because he understands its vast potential.  Mark becomes enamored and captivated by Sean's leadership and vision and is drawn to Silicon Valley much to Eduardo's consternation.  But with Sean's guidance comes his lavish, illicit lifestyle which has potential consequences for all.  As the company expands to the whole country and becomes a global presence, it seeks more capital, and the ensuing growing pains will test friendships and lead to betrayals and litigation.  By the end, everyone is suing to get a piece of the action.  We're not talking millions of dollars at stake but staggering numbers that far exceed normal comprehension.

Jesse Eisenberg (Adventureland, Zombieland) is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg, a high energy geek running around a snowy campus in his shorts and flip flops and is quick to respond to his critics with venomous sarcasm.  Making us fascinated with such an unsavory character is testament to his performance.  Justin Timberlake is excellent as the charismatic entrepreneur Sean, who is portrayed as a narcissistic, lecherous Svengali and mentor to Mark.  Andrew Garfield lends very strong support as Eduardo, Mark's roommate.

The film's pace is rapid and driven, not a slow spot at all.  Its structure incorporates flashbacks and flash forwards in a masterful display of film editing. The story works as a kind of techie mystery especially from the point of view of a legal deposition that frames the events of the past.  Every major player gets a scripted point of view Rashomon style.  All through the narrative, you keep wondering if Mark knows more than he lets on.  Is he nave or is he a schemer or both?  Was the betrayal of Eduardo orchestrated by Mark or was it the machinations of Sean? It is never truly clear as to Mark's culpability.  This is success, but at what price?
There's very little to gripe about in this film.  A short scene with Eduardo's psychotic girlfriend is shocking but ultimately pointless. Were the filmmakers trying to show his poor judge of character?  Also, I noticed a scene where the actors talk in the supposed cold with digital condensation coming from their mouths; so how come the extras don't have any? A major subplot showing Eduardo's initiation to the elite Phoenix Club never makes clear whether Mark had a hand in his acceptance.

With its fascinating subject matter, the script begs your attention and participation.  Sorkin has done a marvelous job of bringing a book to life and complemented with Fincher's acumen.  The dialogue is stunning in its blatant display of Zuckerberg's intelligence and rebellious streak.  The result is a chronicle of a techie generation with not one false note and a thoroughly engrossing screenplay that has Oscar written all over it. Fincher is proving himself to be a great director when given superior material, and his branching out from thrillers to more mainstream fare has been remarkable (as in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button).  One can only wonder the goodies that await movie audiences as he explores further.",1298592000,,4929,5.008588957055215
4067532,5,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network"" captures the zeitgeist of the moment better than any movie of recent times.

This Aaron Sorkin adaptation of the Ben Mezrich nonfiction novel, ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" purports to tell the story of Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder of Facebook, who rose from simple Harvard student to become the youngest billionaire in the world. I say ""purports"" because clearly the movie takes certain liberties with many of the facts of the story (most egregiously, perhaps, the fact that Zuckerberg actually had a girlfriend during the time depicted here) and, thus, the movie isn't really all that valuable as a documentary account of the way things actually went down. What the movie does do incredibly well is to capture the mood of an era and to tell a compelling story for our times.

One of ""The Social Network's"" greatest strengths is its willingness to feature a protagonist who is not all that easy to like. As portrayed in the film, Zuckerberg is a brilliant, amoral, petulant, socially inept, overcompensating nerd who doesn't really care who he hurts on his way to the top. Yet, oddly, Zuckerberg seems to have no real yen for fame and fortune; indeed his initial impetus for creating Facebook seems to arise as much out of a desire to get back at his girlfriend for breaking up with him as to become rich and famous (those being mere ancillary benefits). Zuckerberg also spends much of his time trying to backstab those around him, including his best friend and roommate, Eduardo Severin, who is the initial source of funding for the project and who becomes the tale's ethical counterweight to the morally bankrupt Zuckerberg. But Zuckerberg is also eventually sued by the Winklevoss brothers, some fellow Harvard students, for allegedly appropriating their initial social-networking idea and making it his own.  Zuckerberg's motive for being a first-class jerk seems to be jealousy born out of his inability to fit in with the ""jock"" class at the school. Yet, every attempt he makes at ingratiating himself with others - particularly women - only serves to reinforce the sociopathic nature of his personality.

Yet, there's something about Zuckerberg that keeps him from becoming entirely loathsome and that actually makes us identify with him to some extent.  Perhaps, it's that very awkwardness - that inability to master or even understand the social codes by which relationships work - that makes Zuckerberg a more sympathetic figure than he perhaps deserves to be. As one of the characters late in the film says in assessing his character, ""You're not an a-hole, Mark; you're just trying so hard to be."" Or perhaps it's the subtlety and depth that Jesse Eisenberg brings to the role that results in that effect.

""The Social Network"" is like a fine Greek tragedy being played out in modern dress, except that Zuckerberg's ""fall"" occurs mainly in the realm of human relationships and fineness of character and not of fame, fortune or status (since Zuckerberg still seems to have all three still pretty much intact at this point). When, at the end, the creator of Facebook sits all alone at a laptop, having lost the one person who was ever really a true friend to him, and meekly asks permission to use the law office's computer, we see the tragic emptiness of a man who's sold his soul to the devil - if, indeed, he had a soul to sell in the first place.  It is that ambiguity that lifts ""The Social Network"" above the traditional morality play and makes it speak directly to our time.

There is literally not a single performance - whether major or minor - in this film that is less than outstanding. In addition to Eisenberg, there is tremendous work from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo; the perpetually underrated Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the crassly manipulative creator of Napster; and Armie Hammer as the Harvard rowing twins (lots of CGI here) who fall victim to Zuckerberg's conniving - and become surprisingly sympathetic figures as a result. There are also fine performances from Rashida Jones (""Parks and Recreation"") and David Selby (Quentin Collins from ""Dark Shadows"" for the really old-timers in the audience), among many others.

As director, David Fincher keeps the movie racing along at a breakneck pace while maintaining a complex balance between flashbacks and flash forwards that at no time become confusing for the audience.  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross have also composed a simple but haunting piano score that nicely underlines the seriousness of the piece. Fincher and Sorkin make every moment count, and the final confrontation between Zuckerberg and Eduardo - in which years of unspoken resentments suddenly erupt to the surface - is the most dramatically explosive scene I've seen in ages.

For all its topicality and relevance, ""The Social Network"" definitely seems more attuned to the down side of modern technology than the upside (see the recent populist uprisings in Egypt), highlighting how obsessive social networking can lead people to behave in ways that tear at the very fabric that holds society together.  After all, in the old days, one could vent one's grievances against others in private and be done with it.  Now, with the ability to do near-constant blogging, our hurtful words, petty tantrums and malicious actions can go out to a mass audience, ruin other people's reputations, then come back and bite us big time in the end.  That's the lesson Zuckerberg is forced to learn all throughout the movie - and it is one we would all be wise to heed.",1298505600,2,5532,4.960043196544277
4067533,4,B0034G4P7Q,"The essence of Facebook as described in this movie is aloneness. From its creator Mark Zuckerberg who is miserably incapable of real human relationships and whose autistic mind runs on feelings of extravagant kickback from feelings of revenge and exclusion,like a chess genius his brain takes off,it multiplies his power base,by inventing a system where virtual reality,of making friends,of eviscerating people's private selves and turning them into public property,empties this generation of its humanity. Alienation and loneliness fuel Mark's ambition. He gets fame and money,billions,but has no friends.

This film is remarkable in its ability to take the multi-faced apparition of the truth as evinced in its game-changing opening scene of fast rat-a-tat dialogue between Mark and his his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend(did she ever really exist?) and in the Rashomon-like depositions for the 2 different lawsuits intercut and a segway leap into the past to tell the story from different viewpoints. Did this in fact happen or do we get one viewpoint-that the character of Zuckerberg stole the idea from the `Winklevi' brothers and abused his friendship to get money for his venture and find someone better at raising capital?The script is 1st rate with needle-sharp dialogue.

As a sociopath he has no emotional connection with others,no empathy,totally self -centred in focus,finding an idea and not letting it go until its completed. If he feels people are holding him back or not going fast enough he'll dump them without a 2nd thought. He is difficult to connect with,is far from likeable,proves himself a ""prize*hole"",but by the end of the film there's a certain sympathy for him as a focussed personality,who's been taken for a bit of a ride,even if he's culpable for a lot of the hurt and betrayal(his `speeding ticket').We feel a slight ache for this non-partying,ascetic loner,pursuing his own ideas. He envies Eduardo's ability to get into clubs.

The Armie Hammer double role as the Winklevoss twins is both a technical feat and great performance and a great character. The best performance(and the emotional heart of the movie) came from Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin playing a frustrated character,who's out of his depth,but fighting to do as much as he could,outraged when the person he had invested in financially and believed to be his friend,took everything away from him and walked away. We connect with this character,the under-dog trying to keep up,betrayed by the man who sold humanity for success.

Justin Timberlake delivers a strong performance as the Napster founder who totally mesmerizes Zuckerberg like Mephistopheles,with a roguish,sleezy charm. You dislke him but you also pity him. Helping along the marketing by dropping ""The""from"" Facebook"",and saying "" You know what's cool?A billion dollars"".He's phenomenal,taking Facebook to the next level,leaving Eduardo behind as roadkill. Sorkin and Fincher pull off a heist of a movie,which does not skimp on complexity and sympathy,lacing their scathing telling with an underlying sadness and pity for what might have been and what was lost. A final image of Mark requesting his ex become his `friend',like a generation of users,pretending not to be alone. A superb film,thought provoking and engaging,grabbing hold of you and running.",1298505600,3,3315,5.381502890173411

If so, I found Zuckerberg to be surprisingly SAT/IQ bright, arrogant, ambitious, socially inept, insensitive, and willing to betray others. I also found that more work went into creating Facebook than I would have guessed, although luck was clearly also needed for it to become such a runaway success.

While many people are apparently fascinated by this, I didn't find this movie to be any sort of landmark, and frankly I found much of it to be boring. It's basically about a bunch of cocky kids who want to be rich (or richer), and they stumble on an idea that makes that possible, but then they fight over credit and money when they strike gold.

4067547,3,B0034G4P7Q,"There really isn't much point into going into the details of this movie as the buzz over it has made almost all of its details well known. I don't usually review movies, but the absolutely insane about of press, opinions and critical commentary really pushes a person into having some kind of opinion about it.
First, based strictly on the technical skills of the actors, cinematographers, editors and director it is a pretty good movie; but only pretty good. I love David Fincher's style, making Seven and Fight Club two of my favorite movies ever. The editing is a little jarring, but if you are able to follow Inception, you won't have any trouble with the way the time line jumps around. All this said, this movie isn't as good as the all the accolades that have been heaped on it would indicate. The only reason I can figure that the Oscars love it so much is so they can have a culturally relevant movie nominated that people under 40 actually went to see.
Now for the writing. Aaron Sorkin simply made up some stuff using the names of people attached to a well known company. If he was going to make up this much stuff, he should have just created a fictional story based loosely on the history of Facebook instead of trying to pass this off as something that might be accurate. It is common for people involved in the actual events of a movie to be involved in some way during their productions (John Nash with A Beautiful Mind, Hunter S Thompson with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, etc.) but in this case Sorkin used a book as his only reference and has said openly that he didn't want to be tied to the restraints of accuracy. Beyond this being kind of arrogant, it just goes to show that Hollywood has just run out of ideas and is content to sell us rewarmed or ""rebooted"" trash instead of actually coming up with something new (Star Trek, Alice, Planet of the Apes, GI Joe, The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds; I'm looking at you!)
Finally, there is what the audience is supposed to come away with from this movie. Zuckerberg is portrayed as a sort of passive aggressive villain, but if he was an athlete, politician, general, or CEO would anything that he ""said"" or ""did"" be so scandalous? Is the prejudice against ""nerds"" still so bad that we are willing to believe that a smart guy that doesn't take lip from people less successful than him would be completely alone in the world. In the music industry don't they call this sort of attitude being a ""diva"" and don't crowds eat that up? I think we are also supposed to believe that frat guys are misogynous, some entrepreneurs are just arrogant coke heads, and the computer world is male dominated. DUH! These are probably the most accurate things in the movie.

Pros:
The look and feel of the movie is awesome; great style.
I actually enjoyed watching Jesse Eisenberg tell off the twins and their lawyer. Saying what is really on your mind doesn't equal jerk; and if so it still doesn't make you wrong.
Despite some distorted facts and fiction, some of the story arcs are more or less true. My generation hasn't managed to avoid the pitfalls of ruthlessness and avarice in the business world. In the some ways its the same tune set to a different beat.

Cons:
Oddly placed attempts to create a feeling of drama or tension.
The one guy that played both Winklevoss brothers sucked so I don't know why they needed to clone him instead of hiring some twins that could act.
Too much hype can really create an level of expectation that can't be obtained. For sheer drama Inception was better than this movie, and for character development and writing Its Kind of a Funny Story was better, so why all the attention? Just jumping on the pop-culture band wagon I guess.
Sorkin wanted to create a high drama soap opera but the source materials just didn't have enough spice for his liking, so he had to wing it. Research the inaccuracies of the movie before believing you understand the actual history of Facebook; not that either the movie or the history of Facebook are really all THAT important.",1297814400,3,4067,4.531972789115646
4067548,5,B0034G4P7Q,"OK, it's not GWTW, but for geeky computer nerds like ME, it's a GREAT movie!  If you don't like this movie, chances are very good that you don't enjoy surfing the 'Net, purchasing online, using new technology and are also possibly envious of people who earn a gazillion dollars doing something you don't understand.  I'm both a computer/Internet junkie AND business/entrepreneur/business development junkie!  For that reason, I really loved it!

One of my favorite similar movies is Pirates of Silicon Valley about Bill Gates establishing primacy with his hardware/software combo over Steve Jobs and Apple.  I watch that movie, enjoying the humor and business history waiting for some of the last lines in the movie when Steve Jobs looks at Bill Gates and says, ""But our stuff is better.""  Bill retorts, ""You don't get it, Steve; it doesn't matter.  You're too late.""  (Or words to that effect.)

I warned my friends not to watch Amadeus years ago unless they LOVED classical music.  I'd say this movie (The Social Network) is probably in the same position for folks who don't love or understand computers or the Internet...or who don't LOVE watching business history being made.  If you don't consider yourself (with pride) a computer geek, this might not be the movie for you.  I love it and I'll probably buy it eventually just so I can watch it every year or so.  BTW, the music is FANTASTIC and I might just have to get a better sound system at home so I can really enjoy it there.

I hated to read the negative comments.  From a cinematic perspective, I thought it was a great movie.  Unfortunately, I don't think the detractors looked at it from a cinematic point of view; I think they just didn't like the subject and because of that, they slung mud on the movie.  Bad choice.  I don't want to watch chainsaw murders in films so I don't attend them.  I don't want to watch scary, horror films so I don't attend them.  If you, the viewer aren't interested in computers and the Internet, pass this by (maybe) but if you do love computers and the Internet (and business!!!) hey, hit the theater, grab the popcorn and soda and expect to sit through one of the fastest moving entertaining movies about a turning point in technology and business in our lifetimes.

Despite liking director David Fincher's work, the subject matter just didn't seem all that compelling.  But boy, was I wrong!

The nonlinear plot flashes back and forth between the litigation facing Facebook Mark Zuckerberg (played perfectly by Jesse Eisenberg) and the evolution of Facebook, first at Harvard and then in California's Silicon Valley.  Well-heeled twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer in both roles) approach Zuckerberg to help them implement their idea for a Harvard social networking site after Zuckerberg proves his hacking chops in an infamous campus incident.  But Zuckerberg secretly cuts them out and instead develops Facebook with his only friend Eduardo Saverin (played with incredible dignity by Andrew Garfield.)  With interference from Napster's founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the stakes rise.

Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin play up the irony of today's most influential social networking site being founded by a young man with no loyalty, warmth, etiquette, or even social awareness.  Eisenberg's Zuckerberg makes everyone uncomfortable, including the audience, but his narcissistic, painfully awkward personality is riveting the way John Nash's schizophrenia was in A Beautiful Mind: you can't look away because of its complexity and irony.

Toss aside any low expectations you have of the subject matter, and give this film a try.  It's well worth seeing, if for nothing else than understanding how the ubiquitous Facebook came to be.

The film is excellent, both in execution (from a great soundtrack to excellent cinematography) and the script. Just because you personally don't relate to a character (whether he is too intelligent, too angry, too self absorbed) doesn't make it a bad movie, take Gran Torino for example...i found myself literally frustrated and angry at Clint Eastwood's character for the first 45 minutes before realising what great character development they had achieved to evoke such a raw emotion.

There's a lot of underlying themes throughout the movie that it becomes much more than a simple tale of how some white privileged punk became rich. Seen it twice and considering picking up the blu-ray to watch it again.",1297209600,3,964,5.062893081761007

This film is not accurate on a few levels as stated by Mr. Zuckerberg himself, but it does have many offerings for history classes into the future of mankind. I found the movie entertaining and very easy to watch. The people that will find this movie the most valuable to see are those that find Facebook a part of their lives. I would say the movie is Kewl and Mark said he thinks it's ""interesting"". There is a funny video about Mark and SNL after Mark saw the movie. Go watch that clip and see the 60 minutes interview with Mark too. Those will enrich your enjoyment of this movie greatly. I think the best part about Mark's story is, he has so much more history to write for us. Bill Gates is in the Twilight of his life and Mark Zuckerberg is in the Dawn. Stay tuned for the sequel !

Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg, the inventor of Facebook. It starts with him creating it, and brought to a later time when he is being sued because the Winklevoss brothers claim he stole their idea.

4067585,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I loved this movie when I saw it back in October of last year. And I love it just the same on DVD. Firstly, I could have never expected the juicy narrative of the young dudes that created this unbelievable online phenomenon. But to see their characters unfold is a delicious detail you'll never get in gleaning one's superficial Facebook page, that's for sure. And it's this contrast that makes it so juicy!

Zuckerberg is a real anti-social creep--yet here he is creating a place online where everybody can list and communicate with their college buddies...everyone but him, of course. He's the typical nerd-type with a disdainful essence. In comes his close friend who gets fried, the handsome, aristocratic twin brothers who get swindled and you have some amazing drama.

Oh, the irony of it all!

This must win Best Picture--for all the social nuance implied and for the truly perspicacious insight into the inner workings of all the players--not just peach-fuzz- face, Zuckerberg.

No wonder I'm one of the very few who has declined being one of the many on that overly successful website! Non-comformists unite!",1296950400,2,1117,4.957219251336898
4067586,4,B0034G4P7Q,"Being a Facebook junkie for well over a year now, I was anxious to see the movie even though I pretty much knew Mark Zuckerberg's story from other news interviews and such. It definitely helps to know a bit of that too as you dive into this movie because right from the start your thrown into the night that Mark created facemash.com which was the precipice to the launch of the now billion dollar social network.

Jesse Eisenberg does an amazing job as a quick tongued Harvard geek not yet exuding the confidence that we see in Mark in interviews today. I laughed out loud seeing Mark blogging on LiveJournal in the beginning of the movie.  I had an LJ account to back then but left it for WordPress because unlike many, I'm still a blogger these days.  I microblog on Twitter and Facebook too if that's what you call it.

As the story goes, Mark is approached by the over confident and rich Winklevoss twins who want to launch a social network for Harvard students.  Mark teams up with them and agrees to be their coder, but somewhere along the way he runs with the idea and makes it better.  Yeah, maybe he did steal the premise and made it better.  Good lawyers helped the Winklevoss get a 65 million dollar settlement for Mark's intellectual theft, if that's what you want to call it.

Mark also turned on his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, who had 30% holdings on Facebook when Mark made him CFO.  Eduardo had good intentions to launch advertising space on FB, but he lacked connections so Mark swindled him out of his holdings thanks to some legal mumbo jumbo that Eduardo signed without reading.  And at that time, Mark wasn't so keen on the idea.  People hate online ads, right?

It took Sean Parker, creator of Napster, to convince Mark to go global and see the dollar signs. Justin Timberlake played a good money grubbing pompous druggie dripping with sex and confidence, but if you have ever seen the real Sean Parker in an interview, he's nothing like that.  The real Parker admitted about the movie that he wished his life was that cool. Parker stepped in with the ad revenue connections and was given 6% holdings.  Eduardo settled out of court for a lump sum probably larger than what the Winklevoss twins got. By now, like they say in the film, that was just a traffic ticket to Zuckerberg.

The characters, the storylines, and the hefty settlements are all true - the entire basis for the story and where Mark was when.  By now you probably know its the conversations and turn of events that are fictional.  Heck, haven't we all seen movies ""based on a true story"" that weren't even close.  Who cares?  It's the gritty fast paced edge to the film that keeps it interesting.  Face it, do we really care how a twenty-something year old Harvard geek became the world's youngest billionaire?  It's a newsworthy story, yes, and most of us, almost all of us, are hooked on his social networking drug.

As the movie bounces in and out of legal meetings, we get lots of sarcastic one liners from Mark.  The twins fight back with the chips on their shoulders.  Eduardo hangs his head in shame at the loss of a friend.  The movie definitely deserves the Oscar attention its getting.  It's different.  It's fresh.  And if you are on Facebook, then make it some required viewing.  It's worth the time away from the computer.",1296950400,6,3328,4.555555555555555
4067587,2,B0034G4P7Q,"I really don't understand. Aside from decent acting, I saw no reason to see this film or why the gaudy reviews stamped on it's dvd cover were even written. The founder of Facebook was smart and wealthy enough to get into Harvard, so he was hardly a hard-luck case, he ripped off a couple of already existing social networks, stole ideas and money from ""friends"" of his and somehow I'm supposed to be impressed that he's the youngest billionaire in history? Sorry, but I wasn't. When something comes along that 14-25 year-olds see as cooler than Facebook, I'm guessing he won't be a billionaire or relevant anymore.",1296864000,7,614,4.747663551401869

4067589,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I personally wanted to see this movie not because of the subject matter, but because of the cast and crew behind it. When I heard Aaron Sorkin, esteemed writer of The West Wing, was going to be writing this, I was so excited. And Kevin Spacey as a producer? Count me in. At the time Jesse Eisenberg was in the back of my mind. I'd seen him in Adventureland and Zombieland, and thought he was hilarious, but that was it. He never struck me as a ""serious"" actor. It wasn't until shortly before the release of The Social Network that I realized he'd been in several serious films, and was extremely talented. Needless to say, he blew me away with his portrayal of a seriously flawed genius in this film. I didn't even know who Andrew Garfield or Armie Hammer were. I love it when unknown actors shine in films like this.

Sorkin's script was phenomenal just as I knew it would be, and the acting was top notch - I was even impressed with Timberlake's cheeky portrayal of Sean Parker. The pacing and timing was impeccable. David Fincher certainly deserved his Golden Globe.

Overall, if you're looking for a movie to really enjoy through and through, watch The Social Network. It's alternately hilarious, tragic, introspective, clever, and frustrating. Fantastic.",1296777600,2,1259,4.718181818181818
4067590,2,B0034G4P7Q,"Everytime I ask a person what they tought about The Social Network, they always say something along the lines of ""it's a brilliant film about friendship and betrayal"" or ""It's just a movie about Facebook"". I fall on the second camp.

The fact that the main theme of this movie is supposed to be betrayal just goes to show you how manipulative it really is. The Social Network's one fatal mistake is that it's set on making you hate the main character from the start, making him into a predictable and manipulative device with a completely uninteresting personality.

I'm all for amoral characters, I love stories when the line between black and white is not exactly defined and I think the characters in that grey area of moral ambiguity can make a film great. This movie tries to sell Jesse Eisenberg's character as an interesting person along those lines, only failing to realize that to pull that feat off you need to add some depth.

There was no friendship between the two main characters to begin with, making their dynamic feel forced from the start. They want you to believe that the creation of Facebook and greed tore these guys apart, and that the great irony of Facebook is that it was created from a number of strained social relationships; when there is really nothing there. The story ends up being a shallow, manipulative story about a completely uninteresting person getting rich.

4067595,5,B0034G4P7Q,"From the opening conversation, you can tell you're watching a David Fincher movie, just by the lighting. After the conversation, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's score first plays and it was from that moment on that I knew I was about to watch something really special. This is a film I didn't get to see in theaters due to the never ending calling of the parenthood drum. I wish I had but hey, I got my hands on the Blu-Ray and I'm happy to say that the film gets a very well deserved treatment.

The film itself is really something. It maintains a level of intensity that rarely lets up, something pretty impressive for a film that is about 99.5% dialogue. The acting across the board is perfect. Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake all turn in exceptional work. I'd really also like to point out the efforts of Armie Hammer and Josh Pence, who play the Winklevoss twins. Seriously speaking, they had their work cut out for them and they achieve something truly awe inspiring with their performance with the help of digital effect magic. I am not the biggest fan of CGI but when its used in the right way and as seamlessly as it is presented here, then I'm a happy camper.

Aaron Sorkin is indeed a master of the written word and his dialogue comes off as near perfect. Fincher is running on all pistons and really, were you expecting any less? This guy has come a long way since being the plucky filmmaker screwed by a major studio. I'm happy to see that he's still putting out great work that walks a fine line between flashy and superbly efficient filmmaking.

OK, enough about the film. The Blu-Ray presentation is pretty well laid out, with a feature length look at the making of the film. It covers just about everything you could ask for. There are several other featurettes that focus on other topics, the most interesting being the one concerning the score. I think the score is one of the things that make this movie work and in a way is its own character. Two separate commentaries provide you with plenty of insight from director, writer, cast and crew. The film looks pretty crisp and the sound design, as it usually is on Fincher's films, is high caliber.

Yeah, I'd recommend this disc. If you liked the movie, you will like the presentation and appreciate the supplemental materials, that is if you're interested in that sort of stuff. And if you haven't seen this film, you should. It's a film that has received an insane amount of praise and nominations and I can honestly say that it's a very rare thing when a film or anything else for that matter lives up to the hype.",1296604800,2,2606,4.538297872340426
4067596,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy, Alan Sorkin has written one of those screenplays that come once in a lifetime David Fincher has directed this marvelous film. How do you portray a nerdy brilliant Harvard student who has little or no social skills?

It became apparent that Mark Zuckerberg, the brilliant developer of Facebook, might have Asperger's Syndrome. Brilliance and a remarkable lack of social skills. We are introduced to him when he is in the midst of a discussion with a girl he really likes and she finally gets up and leaves and calls him an 'a**hole'. There you have it, he had no idea he had upset her so, and went on to cause her more anger. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect in the role of Mark Zuckerberg. Off in his own world, but able to snap back in an instant. His story is told in a back and forth between a court disposition and the real world. Eduardo, played by Andrew Garfield, one of Mark's Harvard friends becomes the CFO of this new fledgling site called 'The Facebook'. Along the way there is some confusion surrounding the Winklevoss brothers, Cameron and Tyler both played by Armie Hammer. They are rich kids who believe Zuckerberg stole their ""Harvard Connection"" in making Facebook. Of all of the people in this story the Winklevoss brothers come across as real 'a**holes'. Along the way, once Facebook become known we are introduced to entrepreneur, Sean Parker, played by Justin Timberlake. He is one of those men you would like to throw a pie in his face, manipulative, jealous and smirky. Zuckerberg may have had the insight to develop Facebook, but he could not do it alone, and along the way he gets lost at times. He is not interested in money nor the lifestyle of drugs and rock and roll. The dialogue is wonderful, you find yourself rooting for Zuckerberg. A man of great intellect, but little insight into himself and the outside world.

This is a wonderfully made film, and I found myself so wrapped up in it. The two hours went by very quickly. Great performances and a film well worth an Academy Award.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 02-02-11

4067598,4,B0034G4P7Q,This movie is not about a social network but about some of the people involved in its formation. The story about this phenomenon's formation from the ground up I found to be intriguing but if it was really about the social implications of Facebook and how it deceives people into believing you can have a social life without being around people is another story. Another unintended result is how it can be instrumental in toppling autocratic regimes like the one in Egypt. I bet Zuckerburg never imagined that during his days at Harvard. It's ironic that one of the most socially inept people portrayed in film is its founder.,1296604800,,626,4.752293577981652

4067601,5,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network"" was an excellent movie, and this came as a surprise to no one that I know of.  It was written by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"", ""Charlie Wilson's War"") and directed by David Fincher (""Fight Club"", ""Zodiac"").  It has a likable cast between the well known Jesse Eisenberg (""Zombieland"") and Justin Timberlake (The current prince of pop music and part time actor of some quality), along with up and coming actors Armie Hammer jr. (who, from what I hear, is in the running to play Superman in the next film adaptation helmed by Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan), Andrew Garfield (who will be starring as Spiderman in that characters upcoming reboot), and Max Minghella (which will be good in several movies that currently have little hype, but for all I know might be good).

 The movie has fast dialogue, characters exchange very smart punchy quips, and the props and sets emphasizing this speech pattern, having the central protagonist doodle during a deposition, barely giving any attention at all to the multi million dollar proceedings.  If anything the dialogue might be too fast, the initial scene doesn't start slow and build it starts at a run, and if you aren't used to the style, you'll have to get used to the style or be left behind in the movies strongest character building set ups.

 Considering the movie is about a gifted nerd being swept up into a culture of money-beyond-your-wildest-dreams, the film actually is very reminiscent of ""Almost Famous"", covering a similar time frame, but having an extremely different resolution (SPOILER: he remains a jerk at the end of the movie).  It also evokes Doctor Greg House of the TV show ""House M.D."" as Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as obviously thinking on a higher level, and being rendered so lonely by his considerable intellect that he clings to it as his identity.  He seems to care little for money, and really just wants to be the smartest guy in the room, even when he becomes rich-beyond-your-wildest-dreams he sits alone and continues to construct some massive social directory (the one you are viewing this note on currently), unable to connect with those around him and clinging again to the veneer of aloof arrogance that shields him from the world.

 This movie's strongest selling point is the fact that it has no antagonist.  It has one central character, Mark, and numerous tertiary protagonists that are all working toward their own ends frequently bumping heads as they go, al of the characters are complex and sympathetic, even though half of them are entitled millionaires and the other half is misanthropic nerds.  You feel bad for the Wicklevoss twins who had their idea stolen, limited as their initial vision was, and to see that idea go on to make billions is frustrating; maybe this sympathy is due to Armie Hammer's performance as the two brothers (very elaborate split screen was used), and he is just a likeable presence, but I really liked their scenes, especially when they get royally dismissed and screwed over by the Harvard President.

 With effective direction, a strong cast, and a fast script I give ""The Social Network"" 4.5 stars out of 5.  (Go watch it, as I imagine that my being a little sleepy was the only reason it is not a 5 out of 5, and it was hard to get my mind into gear for the dialogue speed till about 5 minutes in).

 (And yes, part of my enjoyment of this movie is that I am both a blond, tall, and slightly entitled guy, and a misanthropic nerd who would wear flip flops and a bath robe to a business meeting.  But I don't think that should reflect on my ability to evaluate this movie).",1296432000,,3625,4.7253968253968255
4067602,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network is another masterpiece by David Fincher. The film is gripping, entertaining, and important. The Facebook movie easily could've become a joke but Fincher is able to make things that are boring and foreign really exciting. I saw The Social Network first in theaters and thought it was solid but after watching it on blu-ray multiple times the film has really stuck with me. There are lines in the movie that I still think about weeks after seeing the film. Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin and Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg are both tremendous. Garfield is the heart and soul of the film in my opinion and Eisenberg is so believable as the aloof and slightly arrogant lead character.

The blu-ray version of the film looks and sounds wonderful. The film is really dark in the sense that there is very little light in the film and most of the scenes are in the dark and indoors. This is where the blu-ray quality really stands out - every scene is clear and there are no dark spots.

The script is well written. Snappy dialogue refers to the inspiration & development of Facebook features, capitalizing on the affinity with viewers when they experienced those features themselves for the first time.

4067605,1,B0034G4P7Q,"This movie kind of reminded me of the movie Burn After Reading.. a movie which laid intensely dramatic music over comically absurd drama to achieve a nice blend of satire.  In The Social Network there was dramatic music and an emphasis on establishing just how seriously this movie was taking itself, but there was no satire to be found.  No drama either.  Jesse Eisenberg, like Michael Cera, is mostly the same in every movie and The Social Network is no different.  Admittedly sharp line delivery, but through a perpetually soulless monotone and painfully awkward demeanor.  Hardly anything you'd call ""acting"".  Lay that all onto a character who is nothing more than a 1-note jerk for two hours and you're left with a main character you don't like, don't respect, and don't care about because in most cases, you already know how the story ends:  A nerdy narcissistic jerk begins the world's biggest website using other peoples ideas and becomes a billionaire in the process.  People along the way get mad and sue him.  There.  I just saved you a couple hours.  Justin Timberlake's character could've been played by anyone.  Andrew Garfield is really the only highlight of the film as he's the only character that has anything resembling.. well, character.  Depth.  He's the ONLY thing in this movie with any depth that could illicit any kind of emotional response.  The rest of it, like Facebook, is mostly comprised of fake drama being passed off as real drama taking itself way too seriously.
I like true stories.  I like thrillers and dramas and smart wordy flicks that make you think and tell a good story.  The Social Network was an excercise in how to attempt to do all of that and fail.  Zero entertainment value.  Zero.",1296345600,44,1730,4.803389830508475

Justin Timberlake stands out for me as the wily Sean Parker, especially when he gets caught doing something, say, slightly less than legal, and embarrassing Zuckerberg and Facebook in the process.  As 'Seabiscuit' was so much more than a horse racing movie, 'The Social Network' is so much more than a movie about facebook.  Do not miss this one.",1296345600,,705,5.333333333333333
4067607,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network is a 2010 film directed by David Fincher (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven/dp/B001BPQT8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B0007DFJ0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>), penned by Aaron Sorkin based on a book called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accidental-Billionaires/dp/0307740986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accidental Billionaires</a>, and it stars a tremendously deep cast of Hollywood's finest young up-and-comers.  The Social Network tells the origins story of Facebook; as appropriate and timely a social commentary as there could be, and it just so happens to have been made into a story that provides pinpoint Hollywood courtroom-like drama as well as the slimy business ethics we sometimes regretfully behold as a culture.  Many may think that Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed in a negative light here, but certainly not among many of the people I've known.  He is the cutthroat enraged nerd that many can not only identify with but possibly even admire.  I went to graduate school and worked right up the street from where Facebook began its enormous growth and influence, and all around the same time it happened.  I know a Hollywood production when I see one and I certainly know Boston enough to see a fair balance between the two very different realms.  I of course mean that as an additional compliment to the many deserving accolades The Social Network has already received, including 8 Oscars Nominations and 6 Golden Globe nominations with 4 wins, including Best Picture - Drama.

It is 2003 at Harvard University and Mark (Jesse Eisenberg) suffers a horrible break-up with his girlfriend Erica (Rooney Mara).  He begins a blog that coldly insults her and then soon after creates the website Facesmash, which draws the attention of several fellow Harvard students and internet entrepreneurs who approach him with an idea for a social networking site.  From there Mark begins creating his own website called thefacebook.  Along his journey he draws the ire of his former business partners, eventually sticks it to his best friend and CFO Eduardo (Andrew Garfield, in what is likely the film's greatest performance), and even teams up with Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the co-founder of Napster among other successful internet ventures.  The narrative certainly makes the story far too slick and far too fun to seem like real life, and the real-life people it portrays referring to their real lives as boring by comparison doesn't help the movie's claim toward authenticity either, but I'm willing to forgive it for that because this movie has too many other things to appreciate.  And really, who wants to watch a bunch of homely computer geeks eat pizza and sit in front of their monitors for two hours?

Sorkin's screenplay is certainly the film's greatest strength but David Fincher may deserve just as much praise for putting it all together.  The performances are outstanding by almost everyone, but especially Eisenberg and Garfield.  The film's audio and visuals are top of the line and no doubt deserving of their praise, while the soundtrack is in perfect tune with what appears to be a less stylized but more controlled and mature Fincher.  This is great filmmaking but for those who don't appreciate drama like this or for those who despise the very existence of Facebook, it's probably best to just watch the movie win Best Picture and be bitter about it.  It isn't my favorite movie of the year but it is close, and I would pick it to win the year's biggest award.",1296345600,,3725,5.553003533568905
4067608,5,B0034G4P7Q,"We all know of Facebook and the staple it has become in our culture, but how did it become what it is today? 'The Social Network' is the story of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg and shows us how he went from average Harvard student to the youngest billionare in the world today. Now, first and formost this story is not entirely factual. The film, which David Fincher brilliantly directs is based on a novel that is also not entirley based on 100% fact. However, when it comes to seeing a movie esepcially a movie about actual events as long as it is done well by the cast and crew it doesn't have to be 100% acurate (At least for me)

'The Social Network gets every thing right when it comes to making an excellent film. The acting is supurb some performances are better than others as always. The script is great, Aaron Sorkin gives us a brilliant screen play and his fast switching diologue is perfect for a movie like this one because people who have such extrem brain power tend to talk like that to themselves and others. The sountrack drives this movie. As a huge fan of Trent Reznor it is amazing to see him break away from the industrial/pop music scene and put his haunting sound into film soundtrack. Of course David Fincher as I mentioned did a fantastic job brining us this film it is fast paced entertaining and all around awesome. The Social Network was one of the five films that I chose to be the best in 2010 and now it is nominated for best picture. So win or not it was well done and I highly recommend it.",1296345600,,1527,4.3578947368421055

4067612,4,B0034G4P7Q,"The story of the birth of Facebook is not at all inherently interesting.  But a good director, a good script, and especially exuberant performances lift this film above what could have been childish frat house antics and boring lawyer meetings.

David Fincher's great pacing of Aaron Sorkin's long but carefully crafted screenplay give a charged atmosphere for the actors to come alive in.  The effect is a suspenseful biopic that I was not expecting.

Jesse Eisenberg's clipped and deliberate performance characterizes Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg as alternately socially inappropriate and rigidly confident.  Zuckerberg initially comes off as aloof and arrogant, but he eventually loses some of his sharp edges and becomes somewhat sympathetic.

Other great performances include Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss twins (I was fooled here; I thought the unlikely event of a set of excellent twin actors had been cast in the film. The digital effects are that good.), Justin Timberlake as Napster founder Sean Parker, and Andrew Garfield as Zuckerberg's business partner, Eduardo Saverin.  Garfield gives the most dramatic performance in the film.  It's clear Saverin wanted to be a partner with Zuckerberg on a great adventure, but they make difficult decisions and end up hurting each other.

If you don't care at all about Facebook or find it interesting how quickly the website spread around the world and made billions of dollars, you will still enjoy this film for the rest of its elements.",1296259200,,1497,5.256302521008403
4067613,5,B0034G4P7Q,"First off, I love this movie.  It isn't necessarily a movie about Facebook, but it does involve it.  The movie is all about best friends, jealousy, betrayal, and other common themes.  I first saw it when it was out in theaters, and second time saw it on the blu-ray.  The second time I watched it I began to see how some of the themes inside the movie can relate to how dangerous Facebook is, such as lack of face-to-face communication and obsession.  The blu-ray makes excellent video and sound quality.

On the second disk is a boatload of bonus features, including possibly the best behind the scenes documentary I've ever seen.  I was pleased, as an aspiring filmmaker, to see if follow the entire movie-making process, from table reads, to costumes, to post production.  Another great documentary was about post-production and deciding which takes are best to be used and when to go from one angle to another.

Andrew Garfield, my favorite actor, is in it and he was amazing in it. He is such a good actor. I just thought the movie was extremely good.

4067616,4,B0034G4P7Q,"This may well be seen as director David Fincher's best ever film, deserving of all plaudits bestowed by critics and audiences alike. An improbable idea for a movie, the ""The Social Network"" is unexpectedly involving from the opening scene when we're introduced to Facebook originator Mark Zuckerberg as a Harvard undergraduate sitting across the table from his girlfriend (who is about to dump him for ""being an a**hole"") in a night club. We're shown up-front what kind of character he is: nerdy, a little socially challenged, no effective censoring filter from brain to mouth, definitely not your average movie-hero type but at the same time immensely intelligent, creative and uninhibited by conventional thinking. Young Jesse Eisenberg puts in an oscar-worthy performance as a not-exactly-endearing Zuckerberg (the real life Mark Zuckerberg has apparently seen the film and claims that a lot of the details are wrong). Though we don't know how close Eisenberg's mixed-bag portrayal is to the real Mark Zuckerberg, Eisenberg does a masterful job sustaining a difficult character role and slowly revealing more nuanced and complex traits as the film progresses.

The storyline unfolds by juxtaposing two latter-day lawsuit hearings where Zuckerberg was sued simultaneously by Facebook co-founder and Harvard student friend Eduardo Saverin (played again to perfection by young Andrew Garfield) for being deceitfully cut out of the business by Zuckerberg when he moved to California, and by the rich high-society Winklevoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer in a triumph of seamless CGI technology) who claimed to have seeded the original social networking website concept to Zuckerberg who then allegedly took their basic idea, wrote the program code and made it a successful venture. These round-table legal hearings alternate with the main action, shown in flashback.

The script is razor-sharp and makes for delicious black comedy as the audience eventually ends up rooting for the socially inept and unlikeable Zuckerberg as he navigates his way through the maze of greed and self-interest ranged against him whilst working day and night to perfect his programming for the Facebook site. The pacing is fast and the editing snappy: the viewer needs his wits about him to follow every twist and turn. Justin Timberlake puts in a stellar performance as cynical, iconoclastic but visionary Napster founder Sean Parker who enticed Zuckerman to relocate to California, and had the vision to see that the Facebook concept could be a one-off opportunity to make billions of dollars for the founders if it was handled right and not sold off too soon; that accepting advertising would make the site ""uncool"" and, though it might bring in needed short-term revenue, it would at the same time inhibit growth and downgrade its ultimate floatation value.

The script is full of biting one-liners and dense, intelligent dialogue. Virtually every minute of the running time is, unexpectedly, edge-of-seat drama. Alan Sorkin's screenwriting is sharp, economical, witty and with never a wasted line; the comedy the deepest imaginable shade of black.

Anyone who knows the story knows that Zuckerberg was persuaded to settle out-of-court and everyone ended up rich, even the undeserving. Everyone is a winner, but only financially and not morally and we don't have a conventional ""happy ending"". The film's cynical heart is another great strength: it's a bitingly realistic social commentary on contemporary values, on a global economic system which disproportionately rewards the originator of one creative idea whose time has come, so long as said originator is smart enough and ruthless enough to time it right and carry it off. Zuckerberg became the world's youngest multi-billionaire by age 25. Echoing the opening nightclub scene with the disenchanted girlfriend, the lawyer's final throwaway line on advising Zuckerberg to settle out of court ""You're not an a**hole Mark, but you're trying hard to be one"" could be the definitive quote summing up not just the characters in the movie, but the current zeitgeist in an inequitable and money-obsessive world. The understated musical score is perfect for the mood.

If you haven't yet seen ""The Social Network"", put it at the top of your movies-to-see list. If you're smart, educated and socially aware, and just a little cynical about our contemporary society you're probably gonna love it.",1296086400,,4430,5.322857142857143

It is quite possible the most important and socially relevant film to come out in the past 20 years, and is without a doubt a contemporary classic. I cannot recommend this film enough. I found the screenplay engrossing, the score haunting, the directing first rate, and the acting by the entire cast is nothing short of astonishing. I would choose this at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director, and even go so far as to say Best Actor for Jesse Eisenberg. His performance as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg is challenging enough, but he does it with the grace and sarcastic wit that is needed to portray the arrogant young genius. Eisenberg is always aware that he is the smartest one in the room, and his performance, in my opinion, is the performance of the year (excluding, of course, Natalie Portman in Black Swan)",1296000000,,944,4.658682634730539
4067621,3,B0034G4P7Q,"I'll keep this short since everyone is probably in a hurry to check their facebook statuses. After all they hype this movie got I decided to buy it on blu ray. Well me and my girlfriend sat down and watched the movie. The first thing that bothered me was the character of Mark Zuckerburg. His character is a know-it-all annoying character that most of us avoid in real life. I've never met Mr. Zuckerburg but if he is anything like the movie portrayed him, he is arrogant and frankly uninteresting. I cared little for him through out the whole movie and was waiting for him to get his come-up-ins.

  After the movie was over I was a little confused as to why this movie was hailed by some as "" The defining movie of this generation"" god we are in so much trouble if that is true... I ended up reading something in a newspaper about how the movie made up the story about how Mark started to create facebook. I guess making a movie about guys who sat around their dorms and ate pizza while they talked about girls would be pretty boring.

 The Social Network is not a bad movie, its just a very average one. It tries so hard to be this epic story of betrayal and greed when in reality the movie had very little impact or lasting impression on myself. On a different note, the acting is pretty top notch.

4067624,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Critics around the world have hailed THE SOCIAL NETWORK as the best film of the year. It won the Golden Globe for best picture, director, score, screenplay, actor and supporting actor and has been nominated for best picture at the Oscars. So is it really a good movie? Fortunately the answer is yes.

The movie tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a computer geek at Harvard with practically no skills whatsoever when it comes to interacting with actual people. Dumped by his girlfriend as the movie opens, he returns to his dorm room, drinks heavily and begins blogging about her in the worst way possible. At the same time he hacks into various dorm data banks for pictures of girls across campus and then with a little help from his friends creates a web site that offers people the chance to rate each one against another. One can only imagine how well THAT goes over.

Chastised by the administration, Mark is then sought out by a prestigious pair of twin students, the Winklevoss brothers, in the hopes that he will assist then in creating an information site that will provide personal information between students at Harvard. He accepts but places their needs on the back burner while working on his own site, The Facebook. Unfortunately the whole idea behind The Facebook is similar to what they've asked him to create.

Using none of the computer code they used on their site, Mark creates Facebook and it becomes popular with the student at Harvard. With the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), he gets the financing to make the site even bigger. But as it grows so do the problems that come with something this big.

Mark views the world differently than most. His inability to communicate with people on a one to one basis is less about his not caring and more about the fact that he is more comfortable with writing code than having a simple date. And while he may be a genius when it comes to computers, his desire for a higher social status interferes with many of the decisions he makes throughout the film.

As the site becomes more popular, Mark and Eduardo expand their horizons making it available to universities other than Harvard. This of course doesn't set well with the Winklevoss brothers. But more problems are on the horizon as Eduardo insists that they begin posting ads on the site to create a flow of income. For Mark the site has nothing to do with making money. It's about the creation of the site and his being able to take credit for it, to elevate his status on both the campus and in the world.

As the site expands to Stanford, it draws the attention of Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster, who has a nose for business as well as trouble. He entices Mark to take the site over the top and make it the biggest most profitable web site around. As Eduardo attempts to gain funds via advertising and more in New York, Parker involves himself with Mark and gets funding set up in California. The rivalry between the two over the fortunes derived from Mark's creation is a parallel storyline as both Eduardo and the Winklevoss brothers are both suing Mark for millions.

A film about computer geeks that's interesting? No action, no explosions, gunplay involved? The answer is yes, the film is quite interesting and yes it does offer one of the best stories told on screen. The wordplay is fast and furious and Aaron Sorkin deserves every nomination he receives.

The acting is once more top notch with you feeling as if everyone involved truly is their character. Eisenberg is a master at fast paced conversation in every film I've seen him in and he takes it to a whole new level here. Even Timberlake, who many would want to toss off as just a boy band singer, does a great job here as a character who is both charming and slithery at the same time.

Most of us online know that Facebook exists and many of us use it. But my belief is that few know the story behind its creation or the turmoil that came between friends over its success. As with most movies my guess is that there is a certain amount of one sided story being told here but it still offers one hell of a story.",1295913600,,4172,4.559412550066756

4067629,5,B0034G4P7Q,"When it was announced that director David Fincher's latest project was about Facebook, I was taken aback. As the film approached its release date, I became even more astounded at how critically acclaimed it was. The Social Network received nearly universal acclaim, has been called ""the movie of our generation,"" and has been compared to Citizen Kane. It has also won nearly every award it's been nominated for and it's a safe bet that the film will take home Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film succeeds because it isn't just about Facebook, but instead uses the tremendously popular social networking site as a backdrop for the action. Writer Aaron Sorkin explores themes in his screenplay that elevate the material far beyond what a simple ""Facebook movie"" would be.

The film begins with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard student and his girlfriend Erika (Rooney Mara) discussing Mark's obsession with getting into a Final Club. By the end of this brilliantly staged opening scene, Erika breaks up with Mark because he's ""an a**hole."" Intoxicated, Mark returns to his dorm room and begins blogging about Erika while creating a website that compares two female college students and allows users to pick the one they find more attractive. This site crashes Harvard's network, which impresses twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) and their business partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella) enough to approach Mark to help them create a social networking site called The Harvard Connection. This meeting inspires Mark to create The Facebook, a social networking site that ""puts the entire social experience of college online."" Bringing in his best friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) as CFO, the film follows Mark as his idea grows larger than any of them could have imagined. While this is taking the place, the film cuts between Mark's depositions in two lawsuits: one filed by the Winklevoss twins and one by his best friend Eduardo Saverin. The architecture of the script is brilliant, cutting between many different storylines and perspectives but never growing confusing or collapsing under the weight of its own ambitions.

 The entire cast is made up of young actors, some of whom you may have seen before but none that have really made their mark until the release of this film. Jesse Eisenberg puts the rumor that he's nothing more than a diet-Michael Cera to bed with his performance. Playing a real person is difficult, but playing a real person who is not only still alive but only a few years removed from his age at the time you're playing him brings a whole different level of difficulty. It's been said that this film makes Zuckerberg look bad yet Eisenberg makes him a highly intelligent, driven individual whose obsession with creating the ultimate social networking experience alienated him from those around him. Zuckerberg, as portrayed in the film, is sarcastic and ruthless but Eisenberg makes him ultimately sympathetic. Getting an audience to care about a man who seemingly screwed a lot of people including his best friend to become the world's youngest billionaire is a very daunting task and Eisenberg creates a convincing, three-dimensional human being.

Garfield has received the most notice and accolades for his performance as Eduardo Saverin and his vulnerable, likeable performance is a brilliant contrast to Eisenberg's performance. Garfield does a splendid job but I was much more impressed by two other performances:

Superstar Justin Timberlake portrays Napster-founder Sean Parker, who discovered Zuckerberg's Facebook once it expanded to Stanford. I've seen Timberlake in a couple films previously, where he established himself as a good actor. It's this performance where he not only establishes himself as a serious actor, but a star. Timberlake plays Parker as an intelligent, charming, and manipulative businessman who has all the connections and answers that Zuckerberg lacks. Out of the supporting cast, Timberlake made the biggest impression with me. He gives a mature, focused performance that is both convincing and fascinating. With that said, it is Armie Hammer who is the unsung hero of the cast. Hammer and Josh Pence both play the Winklevoss twins, but special effects allow Hammer's face to digitally replace Pence's to portray the two. This is the same method that Fincher used in his previous film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to allow Brad Pitt to age backwards and it's used flawlessly here. After seeing the film the first time I was shocked that the Winklevoss twins were not played by a real set of twin brothers. Hammer creates two identical twins that one can easily tell apart, but it's the remarkable screen presence he brings to the role that I found really impressive. One doesn't see a performance like this anymore. He captures the perfect amount of upper-class arrogance and respectability, being both fascinating and hilarious. Hammer has a certain quality as an actor that makes him seem to be a movie star from a forgotten era. This is an actor who has the potential to do great things.

The score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross seems to have people drawn about whether it's great or intrusive, but I find it to be one of the most memorable scores I've heard in some time. It's a pulsating, unconventional score that has little time for subtlety. A lot of great film score's serve as background noise or as a way of heightening the intensity of certain scenes. This score alternates between pulsating and quietly sinister, but it somehow works for every scene and compliments the overall tone of the film perfectly. It may not be your typical film score, but it's a great one that shows Reznor could have a serious impact on film music.

This is a very energetic film that moves at a lightning quick speed. The script is a masterwork of plotting and dialogue leaving Sorkin no chance of leaving the Oscar ceremony without an award for his work. When a film is essentially two hours of dialogue, yet is widely accepted by a major audience with no big action sequences or a sappy romance, the writer has done something correctly. The dialogue is both intelligent and clever and the script has a surprising amount of humor, including some very quotable one-liners that don't seem forced or unnecessary. It's one of the few films I've seen recently that I was so engrossed by, I found myself not wanting it to end. Even coming in at the 2-hour mark The Social Network seems to conclude too quickly, yet it doesn't feel rushed. It's a brilliant marriage of writing and directing. Fincher proved his visual flair with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but that film suffered from a weak script and obvious symbolism. While it initially seems out of place, the Winklevoss' rowing scene is extremely well-directed and well-structured, while its look and choice of music reminded me of something Kubrick would have directed.

Comparisons to Citizen Kane are not without merit as both films use similar sources of information (Kane used newspapers, TSN uses the internet) as a backdrop and similarly driven individuals as a main character. Furthermore, both films explore similar themes. Not wanting to be out-done, other critics have said this film defines our generation. After my first viewing, I thought it was a great film but I questioned whether it would have longevity. If this film had been made 3 years ago and had been about myspace, would it be relevant today? The more I think about it, the more I feel this film will enjoy longevity because of how Sorkin and Fincher avoided making a ""Facebook movie."" The film has timeless themes of friendship, betrayal, loyalty, and social interaction that I believe will allow it to be remembered and appreciated for years to come. Does this film define a generation? That I cannot say. It may not define this generation, but it does define the social climate right now. If it's not remembered as a defining film of this generation, it will serve as a time capsule of how people interacted with each other at this moment. The Social Network is a complex, marvelous film; never boring, remarkably well-made, and one of the best films of 2010.

GRADE: A

*As for the packaging and presentation, Sony did a miraculous job with it. The bonus features are very in-depth and the packaging is some of the best I've seen from a major studio.

4067631,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I have very mixed - feelings about this movie. It has some very witty and quick- paced dialogue. The key - courtroom scene in which the Zuckenberg character played by Jesse Eisenberg answers the Attorney of the Winklevosses is brilliant. Here the leading character makes his strongest self- defense and really expresses his credo. The world he is making is one in which it the Imaginative and Creative are the winners and masters. The 'elite' he represents an elite of merit in a sense revenges itself and puts down the 'elite' of 'money' and 'traditional privilege'. The nerdy guy outplays and outthinks the super- Old - Line giants.
But there is too much ugliness and too my mind, immorality in the story to give additional pleasure. The ugly side of the Zuckenberg -Facebook story is the betrayal of the friend co- founder, and the racing after the fast- lane values of the Napster founder- Sean Parker character. There is too the ugliness involved in the initial impulse for the founding of the Social Network  which is presented ( I understand non- accurately) as having come from the Zuckenberg character's being rejected by a girl he has been dating.
The presentation of the permissive and hedonistic world of both the academic elite at Harvard, and the business elite at 'Facebook' adds to the sense of frivolousness and superficiality.
It is difficult to have any real sense of some great moral message and meaning in the creation of 'Facebook' from watching this movie. The movie itself seems to be a successful effort at telling a story of Success in which the price of Success is betrayal of friendship and deeper human values.
Superficiality and cleverness triumph, as does pleasure and amusement.
So I can say I have very mixed feelings about the Movie. A slickly done job in which Slickness is criticized but nothing very Substantial is presented in its place.",1295827200,3,1875,4.877742946708464

Why?

Well because it is. That's cool...right?

In real life, Facebook is boring. It is the social pornography millions are addicted to where everybody posts pictures of all the parties they go to and beefcake or women they meet, but it's not a scene you can actually hook up on for real -- so strange. It is something I'll never understand. IMDb.com is cool. Who doesn't want to rate movies? But Facebook? Grow fake crops? Add friends? But no beer? Lame.

The Social Network is a dry, talky and lifeless odyssey about why we should care. Well, not really. A Lifetime TV movie in all but name, The Social Network chronicles the rise of the Facebook phenomenon and eccentricity of Mark Zuckerbeg, but it doesn't succeed in making the topic interesting. This is Real Genius but minus any actual dramatic investment or humor. David FIncher uses a deft deadpan touch and Trent Reznor funk to jazz it up, but the problem is, this is a movie about people making a website.

Jubilation over how many hits the website gets in The Social Network is simply not enough for me to be wowed by a bunch of hoodie geeks fighting over vaporware.

And speaking of unrealistic, the scene where Mark and Edourdo speak outside in the 20 degree weather looked laughably fake with what looked like special effects to create condensation on their breath (it was probably filmed in July when Harvard is on break) - next time just have the conversation in a hallway or something. Actually their mouths looked like their were expelling smoke rather than cold weather breath condensation.
Technically, most of the film is shot in the evening creating this irritating dark quality which the new LCD/Plasma tv's often have problems with - found this very irritating - could be different in the cinema though - something that the director had not thought through perhaps?

Good:
Jesse Eisenberg, top class acting, he stole scenes easily.
Score, the score was surprisingly perfect for the movie, very nicely done.
The rest of the cast, Justin Timberlake was awesome as Sean Parker and even though her part was small, Rashida Jones was perfect. Andrew Garfield was very good as well.
Screenplay, wonderful.

Bad:
The movie got boring at times and I found myself yawning every once in a while, I found it hard to pay attention. Even though Jesse was acting beautifully as Mark Z, i found his character surprisingly hard to like. He acted like an ass that would make TV's  House proud, but House is funny and likable at least while he is being an ass, Mark is not. I also found that Andrew's character got on my nerves for some reason, I just found that he seemed almost whiny and annoying.

4067642,4,B0034G4P7Q,"--Mark Zuckenberg, the founder of Facebook about the makers of The Social Network.

The Social Network (2010) is fast, smart, sharp, and very modern because it tells the story based on the real facts going back to the origins of social network called Facebook that started few years ago,  continues  growing every moment, and  forever has changed the way people communicate  whether we like it or not.  At the same time, the story is timeless, because it has been told many times already, that of the unpredictable and sky rocketing rise of a young genius, in this case computer prodigy, not very popular socially among his peers, who creates the comprehensive, easily accessible and the most popular and populated network of communication, which as of now includes 500 million participants all over the world and has made its creator the youngest billionaire ever. According to Kevin Spacey (yes, THE Kevin Spacey), the  film producer and owner of the rights for the book  by Ben Mezrich (""Bringing Down the House"") ""The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal,"" which is the basis for the script by Aaron Sorkin, it is ""captivating story of betrayal, vast amounts of cash, and two friends who revolutionized the way humans connect to one another--only to have an enormous falling out and never speak again.""

What made the film about birth and growing of the largest Internet social network truly remarkable are directing by David Fincher, the film's pace, and masterful editing. Seems that it moves with a speed of 100 megabytes per second, sweeps the viewers like a tornado, and throws them in a blink of eye back and forth from  the recent past when there were no Facebook yet but it was inevitably meant to happen to the present switching between two lawsuits that Mark Zuckerberg had to face. One was filed by his former best friend and business partner Eduardo Saverin, and another - by the Winklevoss twins  who claimed that Zuckerberg stole their original idea for his Facebook.  I am not sure if it is the best movie of last year but certainly one of the most inventive, coolest, and interesting,  the happy combination of intelligent and entertaining film with mass appeal. While watching,  I could not help thinking of it as of Citizen Kane of modern day - even before I found out from reading about the film that I was  not the only one who thought so.

The cast of the young actors all did terrific job.  I've always liked Jesse Eisenberg since I saw him for the first time in the independent film Roger Dodger (2002) and I knew instantly that he would have a great future. In addition to Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield is very good as Eduardo Saverin, the best and the only friend of Mark Zuckerberg in Harvard, and co-founder of Facebook, who  later was forced to leave the company and sued  for his share  in the Facebook stocks. According to the film, the big role in the fallout between Mark and Eduardo  played Sean Parker - himself, a very remarkable personality. Parker was one  of the creators of the enormously popular ten years ago  but forbidden by  court Napster - free Peer-to-Peer file sharing of music.  Sean Parker, as played by Justin Timberlake, is very clever, charming, smooth, insightful, and totally unscrupulous, a Mephistophelian figure.  I never thought of Timberlake much as of  actor but I was pleasantly surprised by his performance. I also liked Armey Hammer who provided some comic relief in the double role of twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, golden boys who belong to the circle of ""American aristocracy"", the members of the Harvard row-crew that  hired the fellow  undergrad, Mark Zuckerberg to create  a social network that would connect the Harvard students and let them communicate with one another on line. While working on the project, Zuckerberg took the idea to  creating the global network, and the rest is history.

I would only suggest to a potential viewer not to take the film as an accurate documentary. It is not. From what I've read about real Mark Zuckerberg, his persona is somewhat different from the character that Jesse Eisenberg masterfully created  in the Fincher/Sorkin's film. The main triggers  in the film that started Mark working  on the new site were frustration caused by the break up with his girlfriend and inability to join the most prestigious student clubs in Harvard.  Real Mark has had the relationship with the same girlfriend since he was 19 - before he had become the creator of Facebook. He said in the interviews that he did not care about joining the clubs, and I believe him. The worlds he has created using his talent and his computer, starting as the teenager, were more exquisite than any prestigious club but jealousy and resentment just look so good in the movie that it would be much more difficult and challenging to make a compelling movie without them,  just about someone who ""might build something because they like building things"". But then, we would be talking about completely different film.",1295568000,3,5051,4.851808634772462
4067643,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Among other things, this film is the story about the birth of the empire. Whether or not you actually use it, you know what facebook is unless you've lived under a rock for the last five years. As a user of this wonderful social networking site, I was surprised about how little I actually knew about the founding of this juggernaut. The film is beautifully shot (as always) by Fincher, has a wonderful ensemble cast and has one of the best scores of any film I've heard in ages. This is not even mentioning the wonderful script that truly breathes life into a film that many would have said unmakeable a year ago. Now it's a Golden Globe winner and sure to pick up some top honors at the Oscars. What I found most fascinating about this film is the apparent rift between generations in our world. Most telling of this is the scene with the Winkelvi and the dean of Harvard. His dismissal of their idea of something intangible such as digital ownership of an idea shows how clueless the older generation is of the younger's potential. Simultaneously this potential is devestating in how it effects the creators. A multi dimensional and layered masterpiece that is sure to become a touchstone of American cinema, I'm looking forward to the ""kids"" cleaning up at the Oscars.",1295568000,,1272,4.632743362831858
4067644,1,B0034G4P7Q,"This movie does not deserve the hype it is getting.

Having now watched the movie and discussed it with many of its fans and read the favorable reviews, it appears the appeal of this movie is a) that it's ""smart"" and b) that it reveals the grand irony that the founder of the world's most popular social network is in fact a total jerk.

I was not impressed with the movie on an intellectual level. The movie is essentially about the creators of Facebook, and not about the nature of facebook per se, its hidden privacy controversies and the fact of that such a shallow and virtually useless site is so popular in our soulless times. These to me are intellectual issues worth making various movies about, yet interestingly enough they are issues fans of the movie are quite oblivious of. Instead we get a movie about the creation of facebook and the petty controversies over intellectual rights (among the creators) for the site. Mr Zuckerberg as portrayed in this film is indeed a rather interesting persona himself, yet this socially inept, backstabbing cyber genius smacks too much of an antihero, that bad guy you like. Is it any wonder that in a time filled with so many egotistical, narcissistic facebook and twitter bloggers that this movie has been heralded as best film of the year and Zuckerberg as 2010 Person of the Year? That to me is just depressing.

Visually, the movie has nothing to offer. It's just 100% of the time people in rooms arguing. What they argue about (the intellectual rights to facebook among the creators) is only very vaguely interesting. Director, actors and composer do everything in their power to make said talking appear profound by talking super fast in noise-filled clubs, but it didn't help (in fact it made it more difficult to follow). The ending/resolution is abrupt and highly anticlimatic.

In short, this movie lets facebook users feel like they've learned a great deal about the site without compromising their own role in the site. People who watch the film come out saying whatever they like about Zuckerberg, but in the end they'll go home to their computers, mindlessly refreshing their facebook walls, posting status updates that no one really cares about, and adding complete strangers with whom they have nothing in common to their ""friends"" list, without once questioning why they feel compelled to do so. Nor, moreover, will they come out any more enlightened as to the dangerous role Facebook has played in undermining our privacy. The movie aims the lens at the wrong people (the creators rather than the users), leaving us with little more than a movie about annoying people making money.",1295568000,99,2649,4.853982300884955

So I pre-ordered from Amazon and watched it once I got it and I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. It was not about facebook.

I don't want to spoil it but please know this isent just about facebook. This is a truly amazing movie.

Not a moment or scene of the movie I remembered either. And the ending was so abrupt it made me and my roommate go, ""WTF? Are you serious?...wait...this can't be the ending."" It embarrased me, to say the least.

All in all, I'm not knocking the fans of the movie, if you love it that's great. I'm just delivering my honest to God opinion that I didn't enjoy it. ""The Social Network"" is terribly overrated.",1295395200,21,862,4.2560975609756095
4067655,4,B0034G4P7Q,"Facebook has become one of the most used social networking sites. And while Facebook has grown by leaps and bounds, its creator (Mark Zuckerberg) seems both illusive and mysterious, maybe even aloof, yet brilliant. ""Social Network"" was intended to offer us a look (fact or fiction) into the psyche of Zuckerberg as he builds something that will influence society in ways that we never imagined. We view Zuckerberg's rise...from his creation of an idea that resulted from an uncomfortable situation with a girlfriend...to those speed bumps that marred his rise to notoriety. While his intentions initially seem ""mean spirited"", you see what power someone can have when they are able to communicate with large numbers of people with mere keystrokes. While he intended to embarrass a girlfriend, he literally created an idea that would revolutionize communication with the creation of the Facebook. While it seemed that his genius often caused him to be insensitive to his friend's feelings and at times seem heartless, you soon come to understand the sheer genius of someone who is so caught up into creating something unimaginable that they become ""disconnected"", not necessarily arrogant or ambitious (as you would expect).

The movie also delved into the two lawsuits that surround the evolution of Facebook. There was Zuckerberg's best-friend who not only bankrolled the operation, and created the language that allowed the system to interface (or something like that), but who was pushed aside when Napster creator/party animal Sean Parker burst on the scene (who suggested changing the name from ""the Facebook"" to just ""Facebook""), with ideas that would literally move Zuckerberg's College networking system to the International arena. The other lawsuit revolved around Harvard/Olympic bound twins who felt that Zuckerberg stole their idea after they approached him about creating a dating site. As the two suits are eventually resolved, you aren't really sure if anyone is really a winner, especially from the perspective of Zuckerberg whose reputation, energy and time has gone into fighting both. To me, the movie really wasn't about the money or the fame, but about how ironic it is that someone who is responsible for single-mindedly changing communication through social networking could seem so alone. His seeming ineptness, social awkwardness, or perhaps lack of concern for others makes you truly sympathize for him. But then again, aren't most geniuses socially ackward?

I am not sure if this is fact or fiction, and it really isn't important. Social Network was a thought provoking movie that I recommend without reservation. I think that Jessie Eisenberg was brilliant (mannerisms and diction) as Mark Zuckerberg. Andrew Garfield was compelling as the dedicated yet betrayed best-friend. And Justin Timberlake is exceptional as Sean Parker, the charismatic Napster developer. Again I recommend this movie to those who want to see how an idea can revolutionize the world and change society as no other.",1295395200,,3018,5.338235294117647
4067656,3,B0034G4P7Q,"It seemed like all computer-genius, but socially awkward/inept (at least that's how he's portrayed) Mark Zuckerberg wanted to do was have a normal social relationship.  When that went south and he got dumped he drank, and wrote a code for a program that would let people compare the ""hotness"" of two girls matched up against each other.

From there Zuckerberg and a friend developed ""The Facebook"", a web-based social network that included an important element of exclusivity, in that people were invited to see info only if they were invited to do so...this is pretty much common knowledge these days.

This film protrays those early days of ""The Facebook"" through it's 1,000,000th member and becoming ""Facebook"", and all of the interpersonal relations and maneuvering that went on as it gained popularity and increasing profile on the net, and multiple lawsuits over questions of intellectual property.

I have to admit that when the movie was over I had anything but a feel-good attitude.  Of course, not all stories are feel-good epsiodes, but even so, when it was all said and done, I have to say that for me it was ""Just OK.""

THE SOCIAL NETWORK definitely falls into this catagory.  It sounds like it couldn't possibly be all that interesting yet not only is it but it is uncommonly entertaining!  Thanks to a terrific script,a fascinating musical score and a director who envisioned this story in a unique, almost mystical way THE SOCIAL NETWORK is quite a ride in an intellectual, nerd-filled amusement park.  The film quality is first-rate and the acting is outstanding.  If these roles were not handled by these particular actors, I'm not sure the film would have been as good as it is.

4067663,4,B0034G4P7Q,"David Fincher has a knack for seedy underbellies, and he finds a juicy one to stab in ""The Social Network."" Working from a wordy script from Aaron Sorkin and a bravura performance from Jesse Eisenberg (as Mark Zuckerberg), he boils the creation of the most successful internet site down to friendship, betrayal and insecurity, with side servings of jealousy and greed. It's the same old story you've heard a million times before, just updated for the 21'st century.

Eisenberg shows the kind of detached brilliance of the uber-nerd stereotype, and he makes Zuckerberg into a believably arrogant genius. His zingers are cruelly on target, even though many of them are delivered at deserving targets. (It also is worth noting that had these things been said in an actual legal deposition, the speaker would have been escorted away.) However, you see essentially a hurt young man whose brilliance doesn't impress many folks because he is an overbearing ween. This fact is set up in the brutally dark comedic exchange at the movie's opening, where Zuckerberg is trying to score points with a girl, all the while continually berating her. One drunken revenge hacking later, and the seeds of Facebook are planted.

But it is that isolated anger that fuels ""The Social Network."" When the spoiled rich Winklevoss twins (played with a bit of trickery by one Armie Hammer) are trying to sue on the grounds of intellectual theft, Zuckerberg snaps at the lawyer representing them that his thoughts are ""back at the offices of Facebook, where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing."" Then to drive his irritation at the attorney home, he sneers ""Did I adequately answer your condescending question?""

There are snakes all over this grassy web, all trying to get to Zuckerberg's money, and at the same time, Zuckerberg stabs one of the only people to show him kindness, his co-founder (Andrew Garfield) Eduardo Saverin. It's hard to comprehend Zuckerberg's reasoning for trying to jam his one friend out of the business, although the snake oil spewed by Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake, who seems to be playing himself) seems a likely explanation. The way these three triangulate forms the emotional core of the film, with Parker playing demonic mischief maker, trying to grease his way into a spotlight that he envies Eduardo for having. The rapid-fire back and forth between all these spokes still centralize back on Zuckerberg, and ""The Social Network"" turns on how much you either believe the story or how much you can tolerate two hours of listening to these wealthy but morally bereft children spearing each other.",1295308800,6,2718,5.022172949002218

I should have known that the actual social network itself is the master of modern buzz and that the hype was propagated by those in it. Don't get me wrong. It's fascinating to see how Facebook came to be and to see technical genius at work but I actually liked ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" -  the story about Bill Gate and Steve Jobs - better. The movie was well done but one of the things that really bothered me was that there were highly technical discussions going back and forth and the movie makers felt the need to have loud background music during some of these discussions. Maybe they were trying to give it an essence of cool or maybe they were going for some special effect but it was more frustrating than anything else. There were a number of us of different ages watching: the teenagers went to bed because they thought it was boring and my husband went on Facebook because he felt it was more entertaining. I plugged through it but those two hours plus could have been better spent reading the Wikipedia version of what happened and then watching Toy Story 3 or The Town. I hope this movie doesn't win an Oscar although if the score does it would make sense since that's what you hear most anyway.",1295308800,15,1302,4.380165289256198

4067666,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Let me start by saying that I am a sophomore in college majoring in Computer Science and Economics (and Math), and my brother is an entrepreneur, so I can relate to this movie on so many different levels.  That's one of the reasons I love this movie so much, so I can understand if you don't think the movie is that great.  Also, I realize that this movie may not accurately depict the story that it tells.  I don't care.  The story was fantastically written and portrayed.

I like this movie for so many reasons, but like any movie, the central focus is the characters and the interactions between them.  The characters in this movie are SO well done.  Mark Zuckerberg is simultaneously the protagonist and the antagonist.  Eduardo Savrerin is such a likable guy that gets betrayed.  The Winklevosses really don't want to get into conflict, but get dragged in anyway.  And every character has clear motivations for doing what they do.  Again, maybe it's because I relate to these people so much, but I really got attached to these characters.

The future of every one of the characters lies in the span of this movie.  You get to see the most important moments in their lives.  You know from the beginning that Facebook is a multi-billion dollar corporation, and you get to watch as the characters vie for their stake in the company.  And in the end, you wonder if it was worth it to tear apart friendships for money.

I have never liked a movie so much that didn't have any fancy plot twists or really cool action scenes.  My favorite movies are The Lord of the Rings and movies by Christopher Nolan, but somehow this movie drew me in like few movies ever have.

Back-stabbing behavior is prevalent in many films, and some of the finest, like Network ('76) and Amadeus ('84), are only 2 examples that come to mind. The rapid-fire script, directed by Fincher with a cast of our best young actors, is an example of an old story meant to apply to modern sensibilities. The screenplay also allows some room for consideration that Zuckerberg had a few ideas of his own, elaborated on some inspirations, and ran with it. As a film, I found it immensely entertaining. A fine film; Recommended highly.",1295222400,,629,4.779816513761468
4067668,3,B0034G4P7Q,"First off, why did this film receive so many accolades?  And why did this film receive so much attention?  Facebook is a social and technical phenomenon. 2010 in essence was the year of the Facebook, capped off by FB founder Mark Zuckerberg receiving ""Man of the Year"" distinction by Time Magazine. And the fact that he's worth billions of dollars.

Let's get to the movie. Aaron Sorkin's script is superb mainly because this is largely a conversation-driven movie, with very little, if at all, action. If your movie is going to be largely conversation driven, it better feature sharp, crisp, and crackling dialog. And Sorkin does it. The actors are superb in their delivery. But I found myself half-way into this film, becoming bored. Yup, bored. It became a tiresome exercise watching how Zuckerberg ""screwed-over"" his business partner and the twins who to this day allege that Zuckerberg stole their idea for FB. Justin Timberlake does act well as Sean Parker. And it's interesting to learn how important a role Sean did play in getting FB the VC funding it needed to get so big.

The fact is, you know the outcome of this film from the beginning. So why is this story so engaging from the start? It's actually not a terribly engaging story to begin with. But the fact that there's never been a film done before on a young individual such as Zuckerberg who founded a billion dollar company makes it novel. I've lived and breathed the Internet start-up atmosphere so watching it on screen didn't make it anymore entertaining to me. Again, the controversy surrounding the founding of FB, the relationships that Zuckerberg had with his business partner and his alleged stealing FB from the twins at Harvard, just didn't captivate me the way it seemed to everyone else.

Don't get me wrong. This is a well-made film. But I don't see any reason why I would watch this movie TWICE. So instead of buying the DVD, I recommend you go rent this film out from your local library. I don't think this film deserved all the accolades it has received and I don't think it deserves best film of 2010, either. Again, all the hoopla behind FB is what propelled this movie to begin with. Much more so, than the ""greatness"" of this film.",1295222400,22,2220,4.696658097686376

This is pretty close. I was interested only in the historical aspect of the movie; who was this facebook founder? I suppose I found the answer but was bored to tears getting to it. Easily directed at the 18 to 30 age group, it left other generations behind. Of course the founders roots were in this generation but the film was too hyper smart. One too many longwinded lines.
  At the start of the movie I almost shut it off. I entered a laboringly dull conversation, and its reaching attempt for the viewer to be clued into a nuanced dilema of nerd vs. pretty girl. The film lacked any and all real humor. Think of all the great ways that the beginnings of Facebook could have been a laugh fest. The Zuckerberg charactor was for the most part unappealing. The zealous desire to reach realism overplayed itself. Too deep for its own good.
  The last seven to ten minutes were the best, and opened the key to what the film should have been. The conversation with the female law intern was natural and less contrived. Sending a friend request to his old girlfriend was great stuff. The camera pulling back, the notes to the Beatles' Rich Man slowly building. Then, a pondering look covers his face. This  gave the charactor of Zuckerberg charisma. That was the snapshot that endeared itself to what Facebook has become.

This is a great movie for the younger generation, it teaches you to go after your dreams and do not give up. Also how to react towards people around you and how keeping the wrong people in your life can backfire and how a person could be so smart but so dumb when it comes to other things. The thing I like most that seems to relate to the real creator of Facebook in real life is that he thinks of something and he stays to it no matter what, its not about the money not about getting girls or becoming famous, he lets people around him worry about that to him its about creating this website and getting people to join and enjoy it. It is crazy to see someone that young make so much money but it is inspiring that someone his age can have a dream and have it translate to that much success and regardless if you use Facebook or not you have to admit that very few things have impacted so many people all across the world whether it be good or bad. It is a type of movie where you watch it and you want to watch it again.

The Social Network was well written backed up by solid performances but I could have easily shaved 30 minutes off the movie and came out with the same understanding. There was way too much useless dialect and the story seemed to go in circles without much of a dramatic impact to grab the attention of the audience.

David Fincher has always been a great director but aside from the dark lighting, it was hardly Fight Club.

The music was great and though I'm a Reznor fan, I was skeptical about whether the music would fit the film. Surprisingly the haunting, and very Reznor-esque, music complimented the movie really well.

This was a good movie but it wasn't the great, best movie of 2010, Oscar worthy film I expected. I was glad I watched it but I think I was happy with the rental for one-time viewing.

The only bad thing about this movie, is the case. The cover slips right off after taking off the plastic. After that, you're left with a black case with the text from the movie poster. While it sounds cool, it's annoying. I found it very hard to take the movie out of the case. I had to spread the case to take the movie out, thus possibly damaging the case.

4067682,2,B0034G4P7Q,"First of all let's put this movie into perspective and try to make sense of why everybody is saying this is Oscar material. It's GOT to be because the writing is witty and well thought out. That is it. It can't be for anything else. Impossible.

Now, let's look at the negatives:

1. The movie moved WAY too slow for as fast as everyone was talking. What was with the speed-talking anyway? Verbalizing words quickly and with arrogance does not make someone sound intelligent. It makes them sound more like they're begging for a big, fat knuckle sandwich.
2. Jesse Eisenberg is not a believable actor in portraying MZ. He comes off as too much of a narcissistic brat, one who knows much less than he thinks he knows.
3. And who is it that continually seems to think of Justin Timberlake as a credible actor? Every scene that this doofus is in is incredibly awkward.
4. The material is fictionalized non-fiction...that's an oxymoron...not cool.
5. Every single character, in one way or another, is a self-centered, arrogant, smart ass, which leaves no one to side with.
6. It was an extremely noisy movie, considering what it was supposed to be. Hey, man, this wasn't supposed to be ""American Pie VI,"" was it?
7. It's sad to know that Facebook was originated from the ashes of deceit, lies, betrayal, and an assinine college prank...all this by a self-centered jerk, who deserves not a penny of his riches. It almost makes me want to pull my Facebook page down indefinitely.

The movie was okay, not great, but okay, and it was definitely not what the major populace would have you believe it is. It's just not that good. Watch and see my ""Was this review helpful?"" button rating go to pot, when all in all, I am being extremely honest and completely helpful. The kind of people who vote down helpful reviews are the kind of people who find this movie to be good. It seems that the majority these people, who claim to like this drivel, must be the types who have to do what everybody else does...they are the followers. C'mon, folks, be realistic. Was this yawn-fest really that good to you, when exceptional movies like the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Inception,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" and ""The Godfather 1 & 2"" are out there?",1295049600,11,2251,4.650753768844221
4067683,4,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network is an intriguing piece of work that spotlights the arguments between founder Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra over whose idea it was to create Facebook. Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin insists that the film is a work of nonfiction, yet the movie opens with Zuckerberg being arrogant, insensitive, clueless jerk and getting dumped by a young lady, an event that never occurred. This was a huge hurdle for me to cross. Nevertheless, the scene sets the tone perfectly for the movie with its spitfire dialogue even if Zuckerberg is unfairly portrayed. The acting is great, the screenwriting is fantastic, and the direction is pitch-perfect. There is a reason that the reviews here are lengthy - the film inspires much dialogue and arouses much curiosity. It's an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the founding of a social networking tool that is turning out to be as ubiquitous as the telephone. The film is also an interesting study of characters that I find it difficult to admire except for Saverin.

A second problem I had was the irritatingly cartoonish portrayal of then-Harvard President Larry Summers (currently one of President Obama's economic advisers). The actor portraying him is a frequent guest on Rush Limbaugh's show so it's hard to believe that there was not an agenda to cast Summers in a dark light. Some thought it ridiculous that he would have been dismissive of the Winklevoss' allegations that their idea was stolen; I found it ludicrous that the twins expected him to assert disciplinary action against Zuckerberg based on accusations alone.

A number of articles have been written criticizing the film of its portrayal of women. Is the environment on even an elite American college campus like Harvard as misogynistic as depicted in the film? It may very well be an ugly truth.

Without judging whether or not the events in the movie are true, The Social Network is a superb feature even if it's not my favorite of 2010. Viewing it is highly recommended.",1295049600,,2048,5.035398230088496

MZ is portrayed as so ridiculously arrogant and narcissistic that you don't want to listen to much of anything he says, which turns out be just fine, since the background noise overshadows dialog though most of the movie. The story moves incredibly slowly, despite the incredibly fast rate at which the characters speak.

You're presented with the idea of a story about the work, emotion, and people behind Facebook. What you're actually given is highly disappointing. The story is told almost completely in the third person by those involved in the two most prominent lawsuits. MZ's character contributes little more than the occasional smartass remark from across the table as someone makes testimony, and you're left to draw your own conclusions as to the accuracy of the bits of story you've just watched.

The film wasn't exactly badly written, as at least the characters sound like they could possibly be intelligent enough to pull off such a thing, but arrogance reigns supreme, making it difficult to root for anyone, and you're never given a real glimpse of any morality to make you believe in MZ. The film wasn't horrible, but it's nowhere near as good as it's been made out to be. Don't go into it expecting to be blown.",1294963200,4,1271,4.852534562211981

I would definitely recommend this to anyone that hasn't seen it, whether you are a Facebook user or not.

The downfall to this bluray is not anything to do with the movie or its transfer to bluray (which was very good by the way), but the packaging itself.  It is only a 2 disc set, so it's not as if any ""fancy"" packaging was needed - a standard two disc bluray case would have worked. Instead, they used a case that is slightly thicker than a normal bluray. It is basically a foldout 2-disc holder that slips into a black sleeve - kind of like you see on some of the cheaply-packaged TV series.

4067690,4,B0034G4P7Q,"Warning: This is a long review. If you want the skinny on the film in short you might want to read a different review.

David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" stands at the front rank of films up for Academy Awards this year. Whether or not you feel it deserves to be there will be up to you. Certainly ""The Social Network"" could easily have been made for, say, HBO or Showtime as an original movie and worked just as well. What resonates after the film is over is how in creating a social network online the founders of Facebook manage to dismantle their own friendship, loyalty and sense of trust to use as building blocks for their billion dollar empire.

A probing, intelligent film that digs into the ties of friendship and how greed can unraval them, ""The Social Network"" works surprisingly well even despite the talky script by ""The West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin's rapid fire dialogue works best when delievered by actors who can make it seem as if it comes from their characters and the cast brings these people to life for us on screen. Based on the book THE ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES by Ben Mezrich, Fincher's film creates a surprising amount of suspense given that the outcome is telegraphed upfront.

Jessie Eisenberg (""Zombieland"")plays Mark Zuckerburg as if Zuckerburg suffers from a mild form of Asperger's Syndrome (which is ironic given the title of the film AND the fact that the character helps create Facebook); he's socially awkward and honestly can't read the emotions of others. Andrew Garfield plays the other major focus on the film plays his partner and co-founder of Facebook Eduardo Saverin who ultimately is forced out by Zuckerburg in a power play engineered by Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake in an equally compelling performance). Director Fincher's ploy of telling both the founding of Facebook and the legal face off between the founders (and others)via alternating scenes keeps us in suspense as we see Zuckerburg, Saverin and Parker plan and execute their elaborate dance of betrayal.

Kudos should also be given to actor Armie Hammer who seamlessly and convincingly plays twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. Hammer gives a truly convincingly performance and if you didn't know they were played by the same actor you'd swear you were watching two different people playing two different roles. Director Fincher does a terrific job of helping to sell this illusion with many of his shots.

The main flaw of the film is how Sorkin brackets the founding of Facebook with the scenes of the legal deposition of those suing Zuckerburg. While some of these scenes provide an interesting contrast to what ""really happened"", they are also a bit too dry and concrete especially compared to the scenes that show the often elusive motivation of all of those involved. Sorkin also simplifies the story to negative effect (much how ""A Brilliant Mind"" was simplified by screenwriter Avika Goldsman to the detriment of that film)using a cleverly structured screenplay to try and make up for the shortcomings of the script when it comes to the motivation of the characters. Fincher (and Sorkin) compensates somewhat by not completely painting any of the characters as truly good or bad allowing some wiggle room for interpretating their actions by the audience.

The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp transfer which all the more remarkable given how dark many of the scenes are in the movie. The 5.1 Lossless soundtrack creates a convincing environment putting you sonically in the world of the film.

For those interested in the extras on the Blu-ray we get the following; two commentary tracks (I haven't listened to both completely yet but did dip into each one at different points throughout the movie)with Fincher providing an interesting commentary track pointing out the flaws in his film and defending them at the same time. Sorkin also provides a commentary track with some of the cast focusing more on the nuts and bolts of the script and the performances.

The second disc features a feature length documentary on the making of the film, an interactive featurette allowing viewers to listen to an early version of composer Trent Reznor's score and a multi-angle allowing viewers to examine one sequence from the movie. The disc is BD-Live enabled as well.

Is ""The Social Network"" overrated by critics? That's hard to judge. It's certainly flawed but still powerful. The early buzz for films like this often create unrealistic expectations for the audience and, as a result, damage the impact of a film. What the film does well is provide us with a glimpse into the blossoming of a revolutionary idea and how greed/betrayal creates an antisocial toxic environment that eats at friendship. The powerhouse performances of the actors in the film make ""The Social Network"" more than an ordinary film.",1294876800,3,4850,4.985166872682324
4067691,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I love this movie. The soundtrack is excellent too. Really fast pace and easy to watch. Inspiring. This movie is not about Facebook. It's about broken friendships, trust, greed, money, jealousy... Social Network is the behind the scenes of Facebook!!!",1294876800,,251,5.3
4067692,4,B0034G4P7Q,"The amount of information about the film THE SOCIAL NETWORK driving it toward being named Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor etc etc etc can only be compared to the global blast of privacy invasion that the topic of the film - FACEBOOK - has caused.  The story of Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg, acted with as much flatline self absorption as the character he portrays - a compliment) and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield in the most sensitive, multifaceted performance in the film) and their brainy computer manipulated program that became the ruler of the computer universe is well told.  The fact that the idea was 'lifted' from the Winklevoss twins (recreated a la 'The Parent Trap' concept by one actor - Armie Hammer) and Harvard sidekick Divya Narendra (Max Mingella) provides the story driver here: the history of Facebook is told through back and forth sessions at the depositions for law suits alternating with transmission of the incidents of the developmental struggles of the toy. It is story of obsession, of the fragmentation of trust between friends, of the proliferation of a challenging brainy idea into a billions of dollars scheme, and it is a documentation of how the current state of mind of the students to adults feed on gossip and instantaneous information dissemination, the results of which we are only beginning to appreciate as individual privacy becomes a relic.

Ben Mezrich's book 'The Accidental Billionaires' as been transformed to the screen by writer Aaron Sorkin and director David Fincher (Seven (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), and Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). As with his other films Fincher successfully creates an atmosphere that captures the message of his films.  Here that atmosphere includes degrading women, drowning dialogue with inordinately loud music on the soundtrack (courtesy Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross), maladaptive behavior, and the gradual loss of dignity of those young people who propel this concept of Facebook to success - not the least of which is a study of Napster Pro Sean Parker well played by Justin Timberlake.  This is a long, loud, noisy, crude, roller coaster ride of a film that probably is true to the mark as a docudrama and is terrifyingly thought provoking.

4067693,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Saw a pre-screening at UNC-Chapel Hill, and just got my DVD copy. Assuming much didn't change between the two, as it would be hard to make anything better than it already was. Here the review:

Anyone who thinks that this is just a movie about Facebook knows very little about film. Lack of knowledge apparently causes a lack of appreciation, but generally the reviews for this seem good so some people get it.

Yes, the film is about the birth of Facebook, but it's what lies beneath the superficial that makes ""The Social Network"" a fantastic movie. The story is from pretty much the beginning of civilization: It is a tale of friendship and betrayal, above all else. The theme has been done a hundred thousand times, but using the current phenomenon of Facebook as a vehicle to deliver us to that theme is what makes the film.

The writing is blisteringly witty, so mad props to Sorkin (whose other works I didn't appreciate much...sorry).

Jessie Eisenberg continues to develop, which only make the comparisons to Michael Cera even more asinine. Yeah, they look kind of similar and play young and awkward male characters, but that's going to be it for Michael Cera. Once he gets a bit older, he may as well hang it up, because he lacks something that I think will keep Eisenberg around for a pretty long time: talent.

Justin Timberlake is no Leonardo Dicaprio, but this movie is a dark comedy, and JT provides the latter part of that very well. The guy has SOME talent at least, and he's not meant to be a completely serious character in this movie (obviously...).

Andrew Garfield impressed me, and I'm looking forward to the Spider-Man reboot all of a sudden. He should be able to equal or--more likely--top Toby Maguire without too much trouble, at least I hope so.

Armie Hammer nails his character(s), and I'm pretty impressed that he played both of them so well.

Overall, this has to be my movie of 2010. Sorry Inception & Toy Story 3, but ""The Social Network"" was just too good.",1294876800,4,1991,4.636363636363637
4067694,1,B0034G4P7Q,"On the technicals:
Good photography, good editing.

On the subject matter:
The kid has very serious issues. Case closed. The opening scene says it all and my assessment is confirmed in the last scene of the movie. He's a social outcast who wants to get even with the Frat house boys, when all he has to impress women with is his 1600 SAT score, which doesn't quite get it done. He's frustrated, nobody understands him, a loner, no friends and he wants to get even. Sound familiar? Every idea the kid ever had, he stole from someone else: i.e. serious ethics issues. Hollywood jumped on this because the old PT Barnum adage that was good then is still good to go now: ""There's a sucker born every minute"". That would include the professional reviewers and I suppose me as well because I was stupid enough to rent the DVD. If this movie is an American Landmark and an affirmation of acceptable behavior, please take note, we are in serious trouble as a society and a nation, which has been confirmed by current events.

4067695,4,B0034G4P7Q,"The movie itself is smartly written, sharp, and funny.  But to me the film seems poorly lit in many scenes.  When I saw it in the theaters I thought maybe the projector bulb might be old and dimming.  When I saw it on Blu-ray I realized the film itself was just dimly lit.

I'm also not a big fan of the Blu-ray disc packaging.  The case itself is fine, but the info/insert card that comes with it is not attached in any way and basically just drapes over the case.  It makes it a very impermanent part of the packaging and likely to be misplaced, lost, or simply tossed away.

I prefer the packaging to be as collectible as the film itself.  The packaging for this movie is certainly ""nontraditional"".

The film itself, however, is very enjoyable though not totally unbiased or based on absolute fact.  Still, this was meant to be entertainment and not a documentary.

There are quite a few bonus features but they do not include the rather interesting movie trailer that we saw before the film's release.",1294790400,,1006,4.502762430939226
4067696,5,B0034G4P7Q,"""You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.""

Those words are the only thing appearing on the solid-black case that holds ""The Social Network"" blu-ray discs.  The packaging looks and even feels much different from the standard blue cases that blu-ray owners are used to.  It's nothing fancy, very minimalist actually, but the simple-yet-sophisticated design makes it feel special.

When you get around to popping disc one into your player, you'll notice a top-notch digital transfer.  Image and sound quality are great.  Two audio commentaries are available.  The first is a director's commentary with David Fincher, who shares a lot of interesting information as well as various anecdotes about the making of the film.  The second is with screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and many of the key actors in the film  - although it sounds as though Sorkin's thoughts were recorded separately because there seems to be no interaction between him and the cast.

Disc two brings a lot of great bonus material.  The documentary ""How Did They Ever Make a Movie of Facebook?"" is approx. 90 minutes long, and chronicles the film's production in both L.A. and on location is Boston.  I found it to be a very fascinating look into the filmmaking process, although it may seem excessive to those who have no interest in such things.

I should note that this 2-disc Blu-Ray set does not come with a DVD or a Digital Copy.  This is surprising given the recent ""combo pack"" trend, but it shouldn't matter much to those who own blu-ray players and want to see the film in its highest-quality transfer.",1294790400,2,1599,4.874074074074074

4067703,5,B0034G4P7Q,"David Fincher's THE SOCIAL NETWORK has created a lot of hype; as expected, the film itself doesn't quite live up to all the talk.  It is still, however, one of 2010's better films (in a year that produced quite a few good ones).  It's the story of Mark Zuckerberg, who created a little website called Facebook, and was subsequently sued by his friends for theft.  Whether or not this is the true story isn't important, of course--it's a movie, meant for entertainment.  And the surprising thing is, it does in fact entertain.

The entertainment factor is largely due to Aaron Sorkin's fast-paced script, replete with quick scene cuts, a back-and-forth storyline, and dialogue that hits fast and hard.  It's a script that is perfect for Jesse Eisenberg, perhaps a little too perfect; he never really gets a chance to come into his own until the final third of the film (the final scene is a killer, mainly because of Eisenberg's wordless performance).  It's the supporting cast that really anchors the film: a gripping Andrew Garfield as Zuckerberg's friend and co-creator; Armie Hammer in a duel role as the twin brothers who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea; a surprisingly strong  Justin Timberlake (joke all you want, he's a pro here) as Napster founder Sean Sean Parker; and an under-used Rooney Mara as the girl who sees straight through Zuckerberg's act (the opening scene between the two is stellar).

The other main highlights of the film are the seamless interplay between Fincher's top-notch directing (the beauty of BENJAMIN BUTTON combined with a twenty-first century sleaze) and Trent Reznor's pitch-perfect (pardon the pun) soundtrack.  The whole product isn't much more than the sum of its parts, but it doesn't have to be, with parts this great.  THE SOCIAL NETWORK isn't just ""the Facebook movie;"" it's a high-quality drama about business intruding on personal friendships, and the prices the individuals involved have to pay.",1294704000,,1944,5.04375
4067704,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Presumably many have seen the film.  Some comments on that later on.

The packaging, I think, is incredible.  No, it is not packaged in a jewel-blue case like many BDs are.  Like many of Fincher's previous DVD releases, it is packaged in a digipack cardboard design - equal in size to the blue jewel cases - as the likes of Seven, Fight Club, etc were released in their respective DVD versions.

The packaging is simplistic and chic.  The paper has a nice rubbery/cloth like feel to it.  I don't know the stock, but it a good quality and the slipcase is all black and embossed with phrasing from the log/taglines for the film.  The inside has the familiar poster of a blurred out Zuckerberg with the ""500 million friends"" quote.  The color image featured is simply a ""wrap around"" piece of standard cardboard that simply fits over the slipcase itself... not very practical or keepable, but was included probably at the request of the studio for ease of identification or whatever other stupid reasons the execs come up with.  I'm probably throwing mine away.

BD transfer is superb.  I did not notice any major changes from film to disc that I can recall, except maybe in the Henley rowing sequence.  I think a slugline was added to the intro of the scene and the sound design seemed to feature some diagetic sounds occuring within the scene as opposed to just the score.  It has been some time, so I could be mistaken.

The film itself is excellent and Fincher has definitely proved himself as a masterful director.  The acting is excellent, the photography is superb, and the writing is outstanding.  It's not just ""a movie about facebook"" it's more about the drama behind it, relationships, and psychological workings.

I predict an Oscar nod.",1294704000,22,1746,4.706270627062707
4067705,1,B0034G4P7Q,"I was never quite sure if I wanted to see this film or not. After reading so many raving reviews and actually seeing a preview that made this movie look interesting-I gave it a rental. I will always be happy that I rented this and did not purchase it. This movie started out ok. Mark and his girlfriend are having a discussion where it comes across crystal clear what type of personality he has. It is not a very likeable one as he seems to be spoiled,selfish and definately thinks he is far wiser than anyone else. She breaks up with him so he goes back to his dorm and gets drunk and blogs about her,while he does something he calls ""face smash"" where the guys of the college look at pictures of their female coeds and decide which one is prettier. He gets asked by two brothers to help them develop a website for Harvard students where they can share their info and put up status's and things. He decides to create his own site instead and when it goes up online the brothers feel that he stole their idea and decide to take him to court.

  I am a fan of Fincher. Well I enjoy Fight Club. Now THAT was a far superior film than this. I do like Jesse Eisenberg. I thought Adventureland to be a pretty decent film. I felt that besides from being extremely over-hyped, that The Social Network was just plain unentertaining and boring. I couldn't even finish watching this. I just watched Apocolypse Now the day before and that is a much longer movie but SO much better..I would even sit through the boring Redux again before I would ever,ever,ever watch The Social Network again!! The main character was so dislikeable that you didn't even care. Since I couldn't even finish watching the film it has come to my attention that he did have to pay financial compensation to the brothers and his ex best friend. Even so..two hours to hear arguing back and forth over whose idea was whose just wasn't for me. I did enjoy the performances of Eisenberg and Timberlake-just not the movie. Everyone has their own opinions and personal preferences and I am not knocking anyone who found this enjoyable.

  I would definately recommend you rent this before purchasing. Don't buy into the hype until you have seen it first and don't always believe a slew of ""five star"" reviews. I feel people are far too generous with their rating system as it is. Five stars should be applied only to a film that truly deserves it like The Godfather.

Sure there's going to be some 3 disc special edition (which I haven't seen yet...), but no digital copies and DRM up the butt is a contributing factor to why piracy is still going strong. I don't even watch the dvd version of any blu ray I buy, I just rip the movie so I can actually put it on any device I have. Legal and morally correct. That's how I watch my movies, but I will magically obtain a version of this movie that can be put on my smart phone, no (or maybe all) thanks to Columbia Pictures.",1294704000,,865,4.18562874251497

I gave it 5. I do like Jesse  playing Mark. I thougt he did a fantastic job portraying a character that he had no chance to study, Who was Zuckerburg in 2002. A no-body. In 2010, a Billionaire.

While everyone knows that facebook was founded by students at Harvard University (originally for the sole use of Harvard students), this movie gives numerous insights into the complexities of facebook's origins at various stages in the developmental process, along with examining the various levels of student involvement in what has become an internet phenomena around the world. Mark comes off as being inately brilliant, yet, irritatingly socially inept. Facebook initially appears to be Mark's means to creating social status for himself, rather than a vehicle/business for the billions of dollars it ultimately resulted in. What surprised me most in the movie was the portrayal of Harvard's former President, Larry Summers. Is he really such an arrogant d***? If so, he represents the pompous elitism of one this country's finest educational institutions at it's very worst.

Also from what I knew about Zuckerberg made me go in wanting to really hate the guy.  The first half I found it easy, he was really cocky and only thought of himself.  I don't know how accurate Eisenberg's portrayal was but he was pretty much what I expected.  Has the movie progressed I started to feel sorry for him, Facebook took off too quick and he was at the mercy of everyone he came in contact with in order to be liked.  For some reason when ever a movie takes over all media and becomes the place to be (like this one did) I have a feeling like I need to find something wrong with it so I can hate it, (like I do with Titanic...different review) but I found it difficult with this one.

4067717,5,B0034G4P7Q,"When `The Social Network' sweeps the Oscars (which it, inevitably, is going to do) it will be the first time since 1984 when Oscars Best Picture winner will match up with the film I deem to be the best of the given year (for those interested, 1984 was when `Amadeus' took the gold; and if you haven't seen it then you MUST IMMEDIATELY).  The fact remains that `The Social Network' is not only the best reviewed film of the year, it is the best reviewed film of the past decade, and while I don't think it deserves that title (I am completely in `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's camp for `Film of the Aughts') it would certainly be the Academy's best choice in YEARS.

Like I've said to nearly every single person I've talked to; BELIEVE THE HYPE!

I have a strange feeling there is going to be lots of YELLING in this review...

In determining the best way to go about attempting to write a review for this film, I basically decided that it was best to just do it in pieces, master `pieces'.  In other words; I'm just going to throw out my current thoughts in random order and hope it all fits together nicely.  Contemplating a decisive and cohesive review for this film just seems wrong to me.  My extreme excitement for this film has me all sorts of giddy and so that seems like the perfect template for dissecting the films utter greatness.

The first master `piece' comes at the film's outset; a masterfully crafted opening sequence that utilizes cold stares and quick witted dialog to establish character persona and eventual developments.  It is the single best opening sequence I've seen on film in a long time (I think I mentioned this fact while highlighting the brilliance that was `Inglorious Basterds' opening moments).  The sparring between Rooney Mara and Jesse Eisenberg was FLAWLESS and really set the perfect tone for Fincher's finest film.

SPEAKING ON TONE; what Fincher does here is just incredible.  The way he creates something so dark and complex and fascinatingly enticing out of what could have been nothing more than a conventional `teen flick' is beyond commendable.

HAND HIM THE OSCAR!

Seriously, there is not a false note here.  The film moves at the desired pace, never lagging but knowing not to move too quickly so as to skip over necessary plot points and character arcs.  By breaking moments down with ease, Fincher elaborates on his character's inner monologue with keen insight and a sharpness that keeps the film very `cool' and `likable'; which is a feat to accomplish when your main protagonist is not very likable or cool.

But then again, who needs to be cool when you are Jesse Eisenberg or Andrew Garfield or Armie Hammer or Justin Timberlake...or really anyone in the cast?

Yes, a major master `piece' here is the flawless cast, all of whom handle their respective roles with enough concentrated naturalism to balance out the youthful arrogance and otherworldly naivety to create honest portraits of American youth.  With a smug sense of arrogance that never once betrays his peering honesty; Eisenberg understands how to carry this film, making Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg nearly sympathetic.  He is never fully justified in his naivety, but he is (in a way) forgiven thanks to the self-loathing with which Eisenberg layers his character's shell.  He is pathetically jealous and painstakingly ambitious, but his actions never feel evil or malicious because Eisenberg breathes a very real life into his eyes and makes this man less a monster and more a human being.  Justin Timberlake reeks of charisma, which is expected, and it is more than enough to establish his take on Sean Parker to be noteworthy and effective.  Armie Hammer takes on two characters, twins, and evokes separate when complementary personalities to each; which is a marvelous feat (I honestly thought he was played by TWO actors, he was that detailed in each approach).  For me though, the star of the show is easily Andrew Garfield.  The way he layers Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's (former) best friend, is stunningly effective and poignant.  He always decidedly supporting, giving heft to Eisenberg as the true start, but he makes the most of his moments and underscores the films more central themes.

Which brings me back to Fincher.  Like I said; I'm shooting this off as it pops into my head.  When considering the directorial masterclass that Fincher showed up with here, I'm just astonished (and his Oscar win will be my absolute FAVORITE of the evening).  Creating a mood and setting a tone is one thing, but the most important thing a director can do is add texture to that mood, and Fincher does that in spades.  The way he uses imagery to propel the central themes of the film is also another astonishing trick that further imbeds the films core into the mind of the audience without browbeating us with a `message'.  It creates an air of simplicity within a world of complexities.

It feels effortless.

One of my friends even likened the films `rowing' sequence, which almost feels like a scene from a different film (cut, paste, celebrate), to Spielberg's opening sequence in `Saving Private Ryan', and while I'm not quick to personally make the connection; I can see the reasoning behind his comparison.  Fincher understood how to parallel the films central themes of power, ambition, loyalty, failure and vengeance with the actual `goings on' surrounding the film without making them so obvious they feel manipulated.

EFFORTLESS.

And now my mind is racing over to the films brilliant use of cinematography; which also causes me to think about the effective use of (or non-use of) lighting; all of which added layers to the films tone.

And that score; O.M.G.

Knowing that I really need to start wrapping this up is killing me.  SO MUCH TO SAY SO MUCH TO SAY, but alas, I will try and close this up like so; this movie is far more than you'd expect.  Yes, this a movie about Facebook and how it was launched and how it took a devastating toll on a friendship and, in effect, on a person, but understanding how easily it would have been to completely mess this thing up is something to keep close in mind, and something that will help elevate appreciation for what Fincher (and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin) did here.

4067720,4,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network"" is based on Ben Mezrich's ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" a flawed but interesting look at the founding of Facebook.  Aaron Sorkin brings ""The West Wing's"" fast, witty dialogue to the movie, but the movie's main weakness is its subject matter.  It has too much Harvard in it, which means that it has way too many a-holes in it.

We hardly see Mark Zuckerberg in Ben Mezrich's book (which is basically Mark's former best friend Eduardo Saverin's revenge), and while we do see Mark in the beginning with a revealing and brilliantly scripted dialogue between Mark and his former girlfriend Erica Albright the movie isn't really a bio-pic.  It's really about the founding of Facebook, and it's hard for a movie to focus on the genesis and evolution of an idea.  And where the movie focuses on bio-pic elements (failed relationships driving both Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker to seek a name for themselves) it doesn't develop these elements.  And if it did it still cannot get around the fact that both Mark and Sean are only hovering around 20 -- and while they live in interesting times and did interesting things they themselves aren't that interesting.

Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire.  He works really hard, and he's focused on having Facebook dominate everything.  But he's also boring, and doesn't really deserve a movie.",1293235200,3,1366,4.9823788546255505

I've enjoyed every movie Fincher has done. So when I heard there was a movie being made about Facebook, the newest socializing network, I rolled my eyes, let out a heavy, moaning sigh and instantly imagined some MTV-style production with teenaged nitwits (Hollywood's newest unknown actors) running around and using slang that seems to be among the in-crowd in high schools today, set to the newest music that is more noticed for its style rather than its actual meaning and quality. But, when I heard Fincher was taking the helm and it was based on a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (the man behind&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-West-Wing-The-Complete-Series-Collection/dp/B000HC2LI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The West Wing: The Complete Series Collection</a>; have you seen him in ""Entourage?""

Students Who Took Vegas""), I was - to say the least - much more intrigued. And once that brilliant movie trailer - the one featuring the Scala & Kolacny Brothers' cover of Radiohead's ""Creep"" - premiered, I was on board!

I have to say that ""The Social Network"" is one of the best fictional non-fiction films I've seen recently. Whether it's Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's public relations working overtime or not, reports have been rapidly surfacing at how unlike the actual Zuckerberg is compared to the film's representation of Zuckerberg, played magnificently by Jesse Eisenberg, one of this generation's most underrated actors (a thinking man's Michael Cera, if you will). Another real-life person whose camp is announcing that he is different from his onscreen portrayal is Justin Timberlake's Sean Parker, the co-creator of Napster. Timberlake's performance is already creating Oscar buzz and while he does a great job, I think that both Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield (who portrays Facebook co-creator Eduardo Saverin, and was just cast as Peter Parker in the new film reboot of ""Spider-Man"") should be nominated. Don't get me wrong, Timberlake lovers. The former N*Sync singer does a great job and proves that he's a force to be reckoned with in drama as well as comedy. But it's Eisenberg and Garfield who showcased a keen relationship that could've been a disaster for any other actors who don't have such a rapport with each other; a good example of this rapport is the relationship between Dr. House (Hugh Laurie) and Dr. Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) in FOX's ""House."" Even in the film during the legal proceedings, where Zuckerberg and Saverin's friendship is disintegrating, they still exude a caring playfulness that makes the audience feel bad about the anger and tragedy of their situation. As for who to believe is the real Zuckerberg and Parker - the film's or the person's - both seem to have a lot to gain for audiences believing them. The film makes more money on box office sales, whereas the actual Zuckerberg and Parker don't face public humiliation and possible loss of business products, which directly affects their wallets. I believe that while the events in the film did happen (except for Zuckerberg's girlfriend dumping him), the film did take creative license in how the characters came off. Nevertheless, the caricatures of Zuckerberg, Saverin, Parker, Divya Narendra, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are all great characters. And they're played pitch perfect by the actors.

I said in my review for Inception that it was the best film of the year and that the only prospects of taking that mantle from it were Ben Affleck's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Town-Extended-Cut-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B002ZG99NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Town (Extended Cut Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;and this film. And while I was impressed with ""The Town,"" it was not worthy of best film. On the other hand, Fincher's Facebook film comes closer to winning that title (but still doesn't beat out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception-Two-Disc-Blu-ray/dp/B002ZG981E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception (Two-Disc) [Blu-ray</a>]). I have yet to see Clint Eastwood's ""Hereafter"" (another runner-up for the title of Best Film), but, so far, ""Inception"" leads the way and ""The Social Network"" comes in at a close second. While ""Network"" is loosely based on the true story of the creation of Facebook, as I said before, it is not a concise history of the creation or of its inventors. Still, I loved Eigenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg! He's written and acted out as this social outcast - almost as if he has Asperger's syndrome - who is ambitious and equally ruthless when it comes to business; yet, he's also a sad, lonely young man who secretly just wants to be accepted in society and by the woman he loves, and his entire motivation to create Facebook and become successful is to ultimately be accepted and loved by the one that got away. It makes for a great story and that's just what ""The Social Network"" accomplishes.

Here is a film that may appeal more to younger generations (those of the computer age), but is good enough for older generations as well. It's reminiscent of what Orson Welles did with William Randolph Hearst in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CX9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;back in 1941. Although the names were changed in that film, Welles wrote the character of Charles Foster Kane to be based on newspaper magnate Hearst. Welles wrote and portrayed Kane as a war-mongering, Ebenezer Scrooge-like character who pushed away everyone who truly cared for him. The story closely resembles the image that Sorkin paints of Zuckerberg; it's a cautionary tale of having everything in the world but not being happy. And it's that theme that resonates with most people. Everyone is afraid of high living at a high cost; and I'm not talking about money being the cost.

Nevertheless, Zuckerberg could be viewed as a modern-day Hearst. He's a genius who took a technology one step forward to change the world. What I liked best about this version was that glorious ending which gives a true peek into the film Zuckerberg's obsession. Love it or hate it, The Social Network is brilliantly written, acted and directed. There are a few misses in the overall pacing of the story (I wish Sorkin could've put more history into the story about what happened after Sean Parker was arrested), but it's still entertaining and one of the best of the year.",1293062400,2,8582,6.239662447257384

However, as ""The Social Network"" shows, you can't reach such levels of success without making lots of enemies.
I have watched this movie 3 times and I can't wait to get the DVD.  Jesse Eisenberg channels Mark Zuckerberg.  Justin Timberlake transform into Satan himself in his portrayal of Sean Parker.

STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Rashida Jones, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Max Minghella, Rooney Mara, Joseph Mazzello and Brenda Song

WRITTEN BY: Aaron Sorkin; based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich

DIRECTED BY: David Fincher

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 01 October 2010
Review Date: 26 October 2010

David Fincher is without question, among the top five best directors out there. Alien 3, Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room, Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and now The Social Network, have all proven my theory through glamorous redundancy.

Not only does he catapult himself to the top of the list for potential nominees at next spring's Oscar ceremony, but he brings Jesse Eisenberg, Justin Timberlake, Andrew Garfield and Kevin Spacey along with him. Kevin Spacey? Yes. His company produced it, so naturally when it's nominated for best picture of the year, Spacey will be there.

Unless you've been living in a hole somewhere, you already know the premise. For the sake of any recent hole-dwellers, I'll go ahead and fill you in (no pun intended). The Social Network is the true story of the founders of the internet phenomenon, facebook.com. It descriptively tells the story of how they formed friendships and business partnerships while attending Harvard, which led to the formation of the site... and then it also shows how they nearly ripped one another's throats out in court.

Rather than spend a third or so of the film in a courtroom, the filmmakers cleverly have us spend that time in private boardroom meeting segments, spliced neatly throughout the film. This allows for our characters to feel free to be a little more creative with their witty dialogue and personal slanders to one another and their attorneys. Good stuff, I promise.

Which brings me to my man, Jesse Eisenberg. He plays Mark Zuckerberg, who according to Wikipedia, has a net worth of roughly six billion; give or take a few million. This is the strongest performance Eisenberg has given, and he's delivered plenty of good ones. You can find it in his outlandishly clever and abusive dialogue for sure; but more subtle than that, you can find the character of Mark Zuckerberg in his eyes.

We meet Zuckerberg in college as he is dumped by his girlfriend at a bar, for being a jerk-off. Those aren't the exact words she uses. What she delivers not only sets the tone of the film and hurls Mark onto his revengeful conquest, but it is one of the film's best one-liners; so I'll let you catch that one first hand.

Whether or not this girlfriend existed I do not know, but in one form or another it's probably safe to say that facebook was brought to us because of a girl. Zuckerberg isn't exactly a ladies man; then again he isn't a real people person in general. Think Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets: he may not be aware of the pretentious butt that he really is.

Not handling rejection very well to say the least, Zuckerberg is motivated by the need of attention. He lashes out online about his newly-ex and what is both humorous and sad, is that he still cares for her; even by the film's end.

The success he earns from his little online bashing rant puts a little rose on his cheeks to say the least. What can he do to gain more of this new found attention? Why, create another site of course. This is his area of exquisite expertise, after all. Here, the story tends to get a bit debatable.

Mark may or may not have had the idea at the time to create facebook, (I'll leave that up to you to decide) when he finds himself propositioned by a couple of rich twins. They appear to have been born and raised at Harvard, and they want Mark to build a site for them that resembles the current facebook.com, pretty much to a T. Mark launches the site behind their backs, gains obvious notoriety, and before he knows it, is facing lawsuits from the rich snob-twins as well as his best friend and business partner, Eduardo (Andrew Garlfield).

One of the best subplots in the film is brought on by Justin Timberlake's character, Sean Parker. If you're thinking his name sounds familiar, that's because he's the guy who created napster. Parker approaches Mark and Eduardo about their facebook site. Being the businessman that he is, he quickly takes note that Mark is the brains in the operation and Eduardo is merely the pockets. Timberlake and Garfield both give riveting performances, and we can feel the heat that burns from their character's dislike for one another. Parker has all the contacts Mark needs to take this thing to the next level so why should they keep Eduardo around?

Business and ethics classes at Universities will no doubt cite this film in their lessons for years to come. In addition to that, it will also be marked in history much like films such as The Shining and The Graduate are, for their cinematography and classic commercial moments. Look for the shot of Zuckerberg with a blissful smirk in his PJ's, about to crash a meeting; and the dramatic boat rowing sequence in Europe. We will surely see these again, paid with either homage or parody.

The film is complex but easy to follow, and moves forward beautifully and effortlessly from scene to scene. A lesser director and writer could have made this material mundane, but we never lose interest even for a second. The Social Network has made its mark in cinema and will be a film that hangs around in a timeless fashion. In regards to college films, it could be viewed as the dramatic parallel to Animal House.",1292198400,4,5575,4.701538461538462
4067724,4,B0034G4P7Q,"'The Social Network' is an entertaining (and fictional) account of the founding of Facebook and the lawsuits that came after. While the hype surrounding this film is a little overbearing the praise for the most part is well deserved.

'The Social Network' starts out with soon-to-be Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg being dumped by his girlfriend causing him to drunkenly blog her and then with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin hacks into the Harvard network and starts his own program comparing the attractiveness of female students. After getting in trouble this draws the attention of the Winklevoss twins and starts Mark down a path to creating Facebook (eventually meeting up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker) and turning it into the multi-billion dollar phenomenon it is today. The film cuts between the depositions of the two lawsuits against Zuckerberg and the events that led to Facebook's founding while we get everyone's different views on events.

It's the creative writing by Aaron Sorkin's screenplay that makes 'The Social Network' such an entertaining and energetic film from beginning to end. If I had one complaint it's that despite an open-minded approach I had a hard time liking any of the characters (even with the film's ending laying it's sympathies with Zuckerberg himself). That probably doesn't seem like a big deal and it certainly didn't ruin any of the movie's entertainment value, but with no one to root for or relate to I wasn't sure what to take away from the ending. Also, despite an ensemble cast there are no female main-characters and the women that are portrayed in this film are 1-dimensional at best (with the possible exception of Zuckerberg's girlfriend, at least at the beginning of the film).

While you probably won't be adding any of the people in this film to your friend's list they are all acted to perfection! Jesse Eisenberg is excellent as Mark Zuckerberg breathing subtle life and believeablity into an off-putting character. Andrew Garfield is becoming one of my favorite actors and he's just as good as Eduardo, Zuckerberg's long suffering (and in the film: only) friend. Justin Timberlake is perfectly cast as Sean Parker and Armie Hammer gives a fun dual performance as the Winklevoss twins.

This Two Disc edition of 'The Social Network' (despite an odd, slip-off cover) comes with a 'Criterion Collection' amount of extras. Making's-of and scene breakdowns mixed with separate commentaries from Aaron Sorkin and the film's cast to director David Fincher make this a must own DVD for any fan of the movie.

While I obviously wouldn't call 'The Social Network' a perfect film, it's still an excellent and entertaining one and this DVD release compliments it perfectly. A winning purchase!",1290816000,,2760,5.097345132743363
4067725,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The last time I was in the movie theater I saw a preview for The Social Network and immediately put its opening date in my calendar. Now it's opening weekend and I already rushed to my nearest screening to see the movie about the website that has defined my generation. For those of you reading this out there...drop your computers, turn off your Blackberries, silence your iPhones and run to your nearest theater to see this film. Whether the story presented in the movie is 100% truthful, who knows. And honestly, who cares!

As some may know, Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook during his sophomore year at Harvard University with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (you can look them up on facebook.com). The movie presents Zuckerberg as being a loner with few friends who wants desperately to be a part of the Pheonix Club on campus. When the popular crew team twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, approach Zuckerberg about making a social connection website for Harvard students, Zuckerberg jumps at the opportunity. Zuckerberg enlists the financial help of Saverin and begins to build thefacebook based on the Winklevoss' idea. Thefacebook becomes an instant success and Zuckerberg is rocketed into stardom. Soon he is entertaining the likes of Sean Paker, Napster founder, and before long is the target of multiple lawsuits.

Of course we all know the success of Facebook and the great drama that surrounds its founders. Still, I was never fully aware of its development and the possible corruption in its founding. The movie portrays Zuckerberg as emotion-less and obsessed with being noticed by the ""in"" crowd even if it means sacrificing his only friends. The film bounces between his legal battles and the history of Facebook which took a bit of getting used to but I think that it worked. The acting is excellent and though Zuckerberg doesn't come off as being such a great guy, the movie does solicit some sympathy for him.

I think that this is an important movie not just because the script is tight, the acting is excellent, and the subject matter is timely, but also because the influence that Facebook (and Zuckerberg) have had on society is tremendous. Six years ago, no one would ever have thought that the word ""friend"" could be turned into a verb or that one could experience someone else's party or vacation by sitting on their own couch hundreds of miles away. Now someone can ""friend"" another person or be ""defriended"" and pictures can be uploaded to facebook so that people you're not even friends with can comment on pictures of your birthday. It's a kind of revolution that we still don't fully understand and possibly won't for many years. Still, this film reminds us that Facebook is just another website and therefore just another business laden with growing pains and legal troubles. While it did, for a second, make me want to deactivate my facebook (my sentiments were shared by my friend who went to see the film with me) I don't think that's the point of the film. Its message is not anti-facebook but merely proves that it is not God's gift to man. Instead, it was created as a means to distract Zuckerberg from his breakup with his girlfriend and which in turn has helped to distract over 150 million from around the world.",1290384000,17,3269,4.813167259786477
4067726,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Who does not know Facebook? Who does not know Myspace? Who does not use the services of Facebook or Myspace? Who has never used their services? In our countries and, within years in the world, practically no one and not in a life time but every year, every month, everyday. Some will say this film shows the worst side of capitalism. I will say this film shows the most realistic side of the spirit and fire of free enterprise and free enterprise, in a capitalist or socialist free market economy, is the engine of the economy and the development of a country, of a society, of masses of people and of each individual.

The film shows marvelously how it is not the rich who achieve the best things when they are young because when you are rich and using silver spoons for breakfast and golden spoons for tea you hire the services of those who are more intelligent than you to do what you have the money to do but not the intelligence.

It is the one who cannot put one thousand dollars on the table who has the best idea and the knowledge necessary to create vast adventures because he knows in our modern world that what is going to succeed has to be cool and cool means free, freewheeling, easy-going, with no controls and no cops, or cash desks everywhere. Everyone knows that you will not succeed in any communication enterprise if you want to cash straight away the profit you will cash in ten years but not from the simple subscribers, but from the users who use the social network you have created to pass around a commercial message wrapped up in a way that makes it palatable for the simple subscribers who hate spam and anyway do not read it. That's where the creator of Facebook and the creator of Napster were and are right.

To liberate that communication power, a power that is virtual and real at the same time, a simulacrum for conservatives and a big leap forward for normal people, to liberate that force is to multiply the power and the force of each individual who can widen his knowledge, stretch his interests, pile up his connections and friends, accumulate his messages and exchanges. All the anti-virtual-reality proponents like Jean Baudrillard and a few others are just bitter people who regret a past that has gone, that is gone, that will never come back ever.

Maybe those inventors are so many Lucifers but Lucifer is an angel of light and I am ready to sleep, bathe, eat, drink, work, dance, write, sing, and do many other things, with that angel of light. They are going to tell you that it makes many crimes possible or easier, and they are just from the pre-stone age of mental underdevelopment. The Internet did not invent those crimes. The Internet did not make man a criminal or a pervert. It is not because we were looking at the beautiful cherubs of the Renaissance that we became, all of us, rapists of children. And there would have been no cherubs, and the pedophiles of the past would have struck anyway and all the same.

The film shows another element that is difficult to take, to analyze, to understand. The few people who see beyond the present and who know the technical and scientific principles that are going to change the face of the world are in this world an elite that has to defend themselves constantly against those who will try to make them work with no profit at all for themselves, I mean for those who are working, who are made to work. That explains the attitude of these people: they are afraid, they are protecting themselves, they are locked up at times in a world that is not that of ordinary people and they seem unbearable, they even try to make themselves unbearable but they are not monsters, they just need to protect their integrity and any human society is always trying to break the integrity of the weak and intelligent in order to accumulate power and riches in the hands of those who are strong and have no principles.

This film is a must in our culture.

4067727,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Not a word or a moment wasted in the entire film. Beautifully and thoughtfully created. Inspiring in ways that I did not expect. Excellent score by Reznor, who is a national treasure. This movie is bigger than the Oscars so it doesn't matter what sort of recognition it receives.

I can understand the misogynistic theme floating around in reviews but I felt like the film is ultimately about the pursuit of a woman, however mislead. The lead character does not know how to relate or cultivate personal feelings. He is young, growing up is a difficult process and the modern world of romance is far away from fairytales and dragon slaying.

Modern love is competitive, intimidating, complex, overpopulated and overwhelming. This is a story about wanting to be man who is desired by women and not knowing exactly how to do it. Facebook and being a billionaire are side effects of the natural loneliness of being a human who wants so desperately to connect yet has no instruction on how to do so.

In the case of MZ he has no problem learning mind bogglingly complex programming languages and algorithms but communicating proficiently with a woman proves much more difficult. The characters dedication to making something of himself seems to be an act of rebellion against his profound ignorance for and anger about his incompetence with intimate communication.

It is interesting to consider that the actual content of facebook, with its virtual screen between who we are and how we want people to see us is arguably a result of the lead character leaping into the unknown armed with an unmatched intelligence and deep fear of intimacy.

Sure facebook is a billion dollar business, but this cinematic masterpiece reveals that it also might just be the 21st century's most powerful work of art.

What brought it into existence? Like so many other things, the world of the woman and the innate desire of man to attract its attention.

Some people are more successful at this than others.

As to whether this is a unique portrayal of MZ's actual life is totally irrelevant. This story has been been happening throughout history and will likely remain on repeat until we find another core reason for self actualization than the pursuit of meaningful relationships.

I only have sympathy for the lead character and I hope that the real person it is based on has come to personally know the value of intimacy through the amazing and trying adventure that is his life.

There is one thing for certain, anyone who sees this should receive the gift of inspiration to do a little less questioning and a lot more of making their ideas happen without looking back.

If MZ has one thing down besides programming its that he does not give any indication that he needs permission from anyone outside of himself to go about his day and neither should you.",1289952000,11,2838,4.806981519507187
4067728,3,B0034G4P7Q,"So many unexpected things went right with Social Network. First and foremost, Jesse Eisenberg plays someone that is supposed to be irritating and unlikeable, and as such, is perfectly cast. Aaron Sorkin's often pretentious and over-written dialogue only shows its ugly head at the very beginning, when Eisenberg's Zuckerberg must make us hate him in a very small amount of time. David Fincher manages to force this talking heads subject into something not only cinematic, but strangely suspenseful. Few docu-dramas nail it so precisely, while also subtly bashing its own subject. Even the good guys in Social Network are pathetic and greedy, and as a film that seems to comment on these rich kids fighting over billions from the creation of the most superficial method of modern communication, it is sublime. Meaning alone can't carry it all the way to perfection though. The films is told in a `now and then' flashback fashion to keep its not none too interesting subject emotionally charged, but does lend a sort of superficiality to the experience, again, which is probably appropriate. Nonetheless, while entertaining and good for after movie conversation, this film won't be a topic for long, and is destined for an early demise on DVD.",1289520000,,1241,5.088235294117647

Much of the dialogue was drowned out by the background noise in film, whether it was music or other people talking and difficult to follow due to lack of clarity in sound.  Person who came with me fell asleep from boredom.

Basically all I got from it was there once was a group of well educated young men, for the most part, enrolled in a prestigious college who were immature, arrogant, self centered, pretentious and emotionally dysfunctional.  Some of them made a lot of money, as have other corporate self serving human beings like the men from Enron. The President of the College at the time was portrayed as arrogant, distant, pretentious and self serving as well.

Cannot recommend this film, not worth the $.  Wait for cable if you must see it. Perhaps the book would be better.  May look into it.",1289347200,16,965,4.590643274853801
4067730,4,B0034G4P7Q,"It takes someone of Aaron Sorkin's talent to diss a litigious billionaire on screen; it also takes his skill to make a legal-commercial spat interesting (admittedly there are billions at stake here, but compare this with Wall Street 2).  So overall I liked the style of the movie; Zuckerberg is played (extremely well) as almost closed down, Asperbers type personality.  The areas which cannot be proved - did he plant stories, call the Police to party's he did attend - are suggested in the movie, by lawyers acting for him i.e. they are suggested as reasons why he should settle with his former business partners out of court, rather than get smeared with allegations.
 The movie takes place (mainly) in Harvard, where Zuckerberg is a computing genius, who lacks certain social skills.  He is part of a group of programmers, and comes up with various programs which (to say the least) are very easy to use (and popular); the roots of Facebook lie here.  He cooperates with (and then leaves) the Winkelvoss twins, who want to form an exclusive online club, based on having Harvard email addresses (or so the movie says).  They eventually sue him for stealing their ideas.  He forms a company that becomes  Facebook, with some of this other friends and eventually outgrows them and moves to California where he is guided by the founder of Napster to dilute the shareholding of his Harvard friends. The Napster guy eventually resigns from Facebook due to being caught at a party where there were drugs present etc.
 I ended up sympathetic to Zuckerberg.  He seems quite emotionally immature, but hugely talented; and has sufficient megalomania to see his vision through (think Henry Ford, Bill Gates).  He clearly doesn't want to take advertisements during the start up phase, until Facebook reaches a vast audience, and has the drive to uproot himself to California.  He has the ruthlessness to get rid of his initial shareholders (not illegally, but effectively) and keep growing.  You may not like to socialize with him, but business success means you pursue a vision without compromise.
 One thing I did directly after the movie was to Google `How does Facebook make money'; apparently it makes about $500 million per annum from various types of advertising and product sales.  Its not exactly ESSO's revenue, but it seems to have that kind of valuation.  Maybe its a bubble.
 Insofar as I have a concern about Facebook , its what happens when/if it goes public, and if earnings disappoint what will the company do with the information they have collected?  However I don't loose sleep over it.  I presume there will be a generation whose teenage embarrassments will be online, however if it happens to everyone it will become acceptable.
 A bigger concern for me is the distortion that is evidenced by the movie.  It is obviously based around the experience of one of Zuckerberg's Harvard friends, while being sanitized (presumably) to be legally defensible.  Sorkin's talent has been used to make this view accessible (and possibly seen as definitive) by the movie going public.  I'm more worried about the distortion of truth by talented scriptwriters than I am about the commercialisation of privacy by Zuckerberg.",1289174400,,3221,4.968283582089552
4067731,5,B0034G4P7Q,"A film about ""Facebook""?  Yeah, right.  Are you for real?

Well, I for one can say with confidence that ""The Social Network"" is a terrific film.  It covers the early years of Facebook and its genesis by a nerdy Mark Zuckerberg.  There are claims of intellectual property theft.  In fact, it is really a fast moving court room drama.  The film's two hours just fly by.

So, my initial thoughts about ""The Social Network"" couldn't have been more wrong.  This is a very skillful film with sharp dialogue.  It is of such quality that I would not be surprised to see it nominated for a number of Oscars.  Stranger things have happened.

We all know that Facebook is a phenomenon.  But it began from very humble beginnings.  Zuckerberg is certainly a prodigy but was the idea his alone?  This is what the film sets out to explore.  In so doing, the viewer becomes an observer to a great story, great acting and a compelling tale.

I thoroughly recommend this film.  Do not have second thoughts.  See it!",1289088000,2,997,4.531073446327683

Going back to West Egg for a moment,  the Winkelvii are a digitally enhanced twin version of Fitzergerald's Tom and Zuckerberg is a tech-Geek Gatsby.

I have no doubt this film will convey the spirit of ""Great Gatsby"" far more faithfully than the upcoming Baz Luhrmann production, sure to be a kitsch-fest-- and produced by Harvard's very own Lucy Fisher, which shows how low they'll stoop to keep the real estate.

As someone who was ""punched"" for a Final Club, I'm astonished by the accuracy of detail Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher muster.

Greed, betrayal, and ambition have been around as long as the human genome.  But this movie reveals how the societal forces that have kept them in check have all been circumvented by cyberspace.  A very distressing theme.

As I was leaving the theater,  I saw an elderly woman who appeared to be in distress.  She was telling her friend ""I think I'm going to need a long time to digest this.""

4067733,4,B0034G4P7Q,"While social networking may not seem like much, it actually seems to be a big deal to people these days and Facebook is without a doubt the most popular of these social networking websites. That's why it makes sense to have a movie based on the whole social network phenomenon that's been occurring since the 2000's; people are attracted and interested in it. The Social Network is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires and does rely on some facts that did happen. The Social Network does a good job at going into the story of the cultural phenomenon that is the website Facebook. It goes into the whom /how/when and where elements of the story that will interest the concerned Facebookers around the world, plus the story is well executed on film and much more entertaining than it suggests.

Mark Zuckerberg is a student at Harvard University who creates a website which allows users to judge which girls are better looking. Zuckerberg's website is so popular that it overflows Harvard's internet. Zuckerbeg then gets approached by the Winklevoss twins in order to create a social website for them that would connect every Harvard student. Mark Agrees but turns them down progressively as he builds ""his"" website, ""The Facebook"", using the Winklevoss' ideas or as he said it ""just made them better"". Zuckerberg is helped by a small team, including financial partner Edouardo Saverin who plays a big role in the making of Facebook. One of the best parts of the movie was when Mark and Eduardo met the inventor of Napster, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), Parker who becomes co-owner of Facebook appears as an eccentric young and successful ""businessman"". Justin Timberlake plays the role of Parker brilliantly; he gave a solid performance in the film. Parker's involvement in Facebook creates between Mark and Edourado. The events happening in the movie happened prior to the lawsuit that's the focus of the movie. The highlights of the movie are the acting performances of Jesse Eseinberg and Andrew Garfield as Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin respectively. Actually, it turns out all of the acting throughout the movie is excellent and this without a doubt has certainly added to the enjoyment factor.

I must say that the portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg in the film is not exactly a flattering one; here he is looked at as someone who made immense amount of money by stealing others idea. The impression the viewer has of Zuckerberg while watching is that Facebook's creator is a shy, self-centered and socially awkward person. It's quite ironic that the creator of the most popular social networking website is seen here in the light of an anti-social person. For instance there is a scene where Mark is at a party and says ""this is all time I could spend programming"", preferring to be alone to company. I do not know Zuckerberg therefore I unfortunately can't tell you how accurate The Social Network is in its attempt at interpreting Zuckerberg. It's hard to tell how accurate the movie really is actually. I have respect for Zuckerberg and what he created but I don't really envy him. Zuckerberg himself didn't have much to say about The Social Network except he wished ""They wouldn't have made the movie while I was alive"".

I'm surprised it receives that much acclaim as it currently does, who would've thought a movie on Facebook could be so interesting? It may not sound like such a great idea on paper but it's worth watching. If you're curious about The Social Network you should definitely watch it, however, even If you're not on Facebook and aren't interested you could still enjoy the movie because the story is good. One of this year's much appreciated surprises. 4/5 stars.",1287964800,2,3703,4.893312101910828

And we imagined revenge. Not the binding and gagging and tossing over a cliff kind of revenge (okay, I've thought of that too) but the French proverb ""Success is the best revenge"" type. We dream of achieving such
incredible success that those who treated us poorly will deeply regret it and the whole world will see us for the phenomenal individuals we are.

Say, you found a company with a very popular product that is valued around the world and in the process become a multibillionaire. Then surely you would have the respect of one and all. Unless you're Mark Zuckerberg, the
co-founder of Facebook about whom a major film has just been released that portrays him as a .... let's use the polite word... jerk.

""The Social Network"", written by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing"") and directed by David Fincher (""Se7en""), follows Zuckerberg from his early days at Harvard, pulling rude computer pranks, through his rise to become one of the most powerful CEOs in the world. And the film strongly implies that his motivation for technological and corporate innovation come from such slights as the girl who broke up with him and the elite university clubs that ignored him.

Zuckerberg is portrayed as a brilliant geek sorely lacking in social skills, deceptive and manipulative in his rise to fortune. He seems at times to be the embodiment of Matthew 16:26 (""For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?"") except at times it's unclear if he had a soul to begin with.

Much of the story is told in the form of flashbacks as the film follows legal proceedings of lawsuits filed by rivals and also his best friend, yet it should always be kept in mind that this is a fictionalized version of the events. Much of the history told in the story is not buried in those very lawsuits with very strict nondisclosure agreements.

An interesting thing about the film is that some viewers will see the film as a success story and others will see it as a tragedy. Zuckerberg (portrayed quite ably by ""Zombieland""'s Jesse Eisenberg) did achieve something very special in the creation of Facebook. Though a recent some consider it a gimmicky time-waster, it is also arguably the most innovative tool for communication since the Internet itself, created by a man before he hit his mid twenties.

On the other hand, some view Zuckerberg's falling out with his best friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), as cautionary tale against putting self interest first. (This theme is suggested in the film's tagline, ""You don't make 500 million friends without making a few enemies."")

And you know, kids, you're both right. This film is about a flawed guy who achieves some amazing things. If this world is all there is, then it's worth cutting some ethical corners when the stakes are so high. But if there is a God watching us and wanting the best for us and an eternity waiting after this life, then something very vital has been left out of the equation.

Now you may still be saying, ""Why should I see this film? I don't even go on Facebook!"" Well, you don't have to be an astronaut to watch ""The Right Stuff"". And the reasons you should see this film include rich, funny dialogue, sharp performances and some interesting moral questions to ponder.

4067736,4,B0034G4P7Q,"It's been a few weeks since I saw The Social Network (2010), director David Fincher's latest cinematic creation. I decided I wanted to give the movie some time to sink in before writing about it. There was a lot of hype (and there still is) for this film, and I was anxious to see what all the hype was about. The trailer certainly sparked my interest and hooked me into seeing it on opening day. Written by Aaron Sorkin, famous for The West Wing TV series and A Few Good Men (1992), The Social Network is the ""Facebook"" movie that has been buzzed about most of this year. It supposedly tells the story of the creation of Facebook from the major players that were involved in its birth, specifically founder Mark Zuckerberg, as played by actor Jesse Eisenberg. But no one really knows if this is the ""truth"" behind Facebook, or just great fiction by Sorkin. Both Facebook and Zuckerberg are being very quiet about the film, neither praising or criticizing it for its accuracy. It will be interesting to see if more comes out about it down the road. But regardless of the ""truth"" behind the story, The Social Network is a good movie well written by Aaron Sorkin and well directed by David Fincher.

The Social Network is definitely a bit OVER-hyped in my humble opinion, much like Facebook itself. While I do think it's a good movie (3.5 stars out of 5), worth seeing in the theater, I'm not quite sure I agree with the almost unilateral high critical praise for it. Am I just missing something on this one? It's definitely an Oscar-nomination-worthy film and it will probably get a Best Picture nod, along with music, writing, and maybe acting nods. But is it the movie that defines the young ""millennial"" generation? Not so sure about that yet...we'll see over the next few years. I'm definitely willing to concede that this may well be another Fight Club (1999), also a David Fincher film, whose pop culture influence is more felt and understood now, a decade after its release. Fight Club seems to be a movie that defines the Gen-X (of which I am a member) and Gen-Y crowd. I didn't appreciate Fight Club as much when it first came out and when I first saw it, but now I see it as a masterpiece of filmmaking (4 out of 5 stars). I probably would have rated Fight Club at 2.5 stars back when I first saw it.

People my age all seem to see themselves through Edward Norton's character in Fight Club, which I do for myself. While Fight Club has a more broadly appealing point of view (at least for guys), The Social Network feels very ""selfish"" to me. But maybe that's what the millennial generation is defined by? Being selfish, self-centered, and detached from ""real"" social interaction. This past decade has seemingly been all about social internet interaction. We now communicate mostly through emailing, texting, tweeting, posting, blogging, and other mobile and computer technologies. It's all self-focused interaction with technology...on our own personal schedule. If we don't feel like communicating, we just turn the technology off or tune it out. It's harder to do that with real people in person or on the phone. Who just picks up the phone and calls someone anymore for an actual conversation? I'm not ""complaining"" or ""judging"", because I fully participate in all of these social media things on a daily basis...using Facebook, Twitter, Email and my Blog religiously as my main way of communicating. I'm just making observations here and noticing how less ""social"" all this ""social media"" has made us.

The movie itself has some incredible movie making talent within it. The cinematography by DP Jeff Cronenweth is great, with some incredible looking shots and top notch lighting. The acting for all of the key characters is very good, including music superstar Justin Timberlake, who is beginning to show his talents as an actor in addition to his talents as a musician. The music and score are fascinating and unique since they are the product of a collaboration between Trent Reznor (from the band Nine Inch Nails) and music composer Atticus Ross. I never would have guessed that Trent Reznor would create music for a Facebook movie! There are a couple scenes in the movie that are absolutely spectacular in large part due to the music. I know of at least two times I felt emotional chills run through my body as I watched the scenes and listened to the accompanying music. The movie trailer (embedded below) has a great Belgian Women's Choir cover of Radiohead's song ""Creep"", which makes the trailer powerful. Seems apropos that good music would come with an MTV-generation movie! I just purchased this choir version of ""Creep"" from iTunes, since it is one of my favorite Radiohead songs (right after ""Fake Plastic Trees"").

The bottom line is that The Social Network is definitely a movie to see sooner rather than later. It's a here and now kind of movie. I'm curious to see how it holds up over the next decade like Fight Club. It's done OK box office. Nowhere near blockbuster levels, but not bad for a ""talky"" movie. We'll know more in 10 years whether this movie defines a generation or not. For now, I'm just glad to have another Fincher movie to talk about!",1287878400,,5184,4.718543046357616
4067737,4,B0034G4P7Q,"The first time I saw the trailer for ""The Social Network, I was intrigued. The haunting music over images of the Facebook experience bleeding into a pixilated image of Jesse Eisenberg may have hooked me instantly, causing me to mentally add the film to my ""to-see"" list. Then I learned the film was directed by David Fincher (""Seven"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") from a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing""), causing the film to shoot up to the top of the list.

I honestly don't think there is a project that David Fincher could work on, especially when he has a screenplay from Sorkin that could be bad. They should make a film of an actor reading the phone book. I bet it would work.

""Social"" documents the creation of Facebook. Using a number of legal proceedings as the framework, we hear various stories about the creation of the wildly popular website. In 2003, a Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) decides to take out his frustration at being dumped by his girlfriend and creates a website allowing students to rate female students. His friend Eduardo Savarin (Andrew Garfield, ""Red Riding: 1974"", ""Never Let Me Go"") sees the potential in the site and they try to move forward. The Winkelvoss twins (both played by Armie Hammer) approach Mark about helping them develop a social network site of their own. Soon, Mark and Eduardo have created a new website called The Facebook, designed to be used on college campuses by students. Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster, becomes interested in the site and tries pushing Mark to expand the site and his horizons. Eduardo doesn't like the new influence and steps back. Meanwhile, Facebook begins to take off and everyone starts to get greedy.

I was surprised about how much I actually liked this film. I was always going to like or appreciate it, but it turns out the film is almost great.

When you think about film, a visual medium, the idea of watching a bunch of computer geeks programming their computers sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry. But it is a testament to the director and writer that this film is pretty exciting, very interesting and always holds your interest.

After breaking up with his girlfriend (phenomenal writing, Mr. Sorkin), Mark retreats to his dorm room and takes out his revenge in a way only he knows how; he begins to hack into various sorority and school websites and uploads pictures of their female students. He then sets up a program allowing other students to rate each of the girls. The website takes off and eventually shuts down the Harvard computer network. At one point, a lawyer (Rashida Jones, TV's ""Parks and Recreation"") asks ""The site got twenty-two hundred hits within two hours?"" Mark corrects her and says ""Thousand"". The lawyer is impressed and Fincher creates a fast paced montage depicting the creation of the site and the ensuing fervor.

As the film progresses, Sorkin and Fincher anchor us by using the various legal proceedings, everyone sues everyone else, as the framework for the story. At one point, the Winkelvoss twins' are giving a deposition, leading to a particular part of the story, which blends into the next part of the story, leading us to Eduardos' deposition in his own trial, leading to another moment in the story. This may sound a bit confusing, or a bit of a mishmash, but it works and helps us follow this complicated story.

Eisenberg creates a portrait of Zuckerberg as a lonely, petulant, emotionally under-developed young man. Everything he does seems to be the result of jealousy or a perceived slight. Eisenberg's portrayal is not very emotional, but this seems true to the character; he doesn't know how to express his emotions which is why he creates a website rating girls. Of course, as he becomes richer and richer, he only seems to become more and more petulant and difficult to reach.

Andrew Garfield, who must be ""The Next Big Thing"" given how many films he has coming out this year, is good as Eduardo Savarin, Zuckerberg's close friend and investor. Savarin experiences the most emotional upheaval throughout the story allowing Garfield to give us a showier, more interesting performance.

But that isn't really fair. Zuckerberg is portrayed as emotionally stunted, for the most part. Because of this, Eisenberg appears more reserved, more distanced. It is a testament to the film and the actor's portrayal that we feel anything for him at all.

Justin Timberlake is good as Sean Parker. Timberlake has turned in some better than average film performances setting him apart from most of the other pop stars who think they can act. In ""The Social Network"", his portrayal of Sean Parker makes him seem like Svengali. As soon as he meets Zuckerberg, there is a glint in his eye as he quickly accesses everything he can do for the fledgling entrepreneur and everything his new associate can do for him. He wants to help Zuckerberg make money, but Parker also wants respectability.

""The Social Network"" is the most straightforward of any of Fincher's films. This is also a compliment to the director's skills, he can dial back the special effects and unique graphic treatments he has used so successfully in his previous films demonstrating to us that he is more interested in creating a memorable film. If the film doesn't warrant the special effects or treatments, it isn't necessary and he doesn't need it.

""The Social Network"" is a very good film, and especially prescient as Facebook grows even larger and more influential.",1287619200,4,5540,4.875664187035069
4067738,4,B0034G4P7Q,"When Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer) thought Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) was making them a web site called Harvard Connection, he was busy making Face Book. They gave him the idea to make a site different than MySpace where students can connect, find other students and blog. Instead of admitting that he stole their idea, he just says he improved upon it.

  The Winklevoss' get tired of seeing how popular Facebook has become and that they haven't seen one cent and decide to sue Zuckerberg. In the beginning of the film, we learn that Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) is also suing Zuckerberg. Through-out the film the movie goes back and forth from the lawsuit to what led to the lawsuit. So the viewer, witnesses how Zuckerberg and Saverin go from bestfriends and business partners to bitter enermies.

  The trouble starts between them when Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster, comes on board. He feeds Zuckerberg's already enormous ego and makes it even bigger. He makes Zuckerberg think there is an ""I"" in team and that he doesn't need any partners. Which isn't fair to Saverin, since Zuckerberg already took his money to get the site running and also promised him that he'll be CEO.

  I never thought that a film about the creation of Facebook could actually be engaging and interesting, but Social Network proved me wrong. It's fun to see everything we use every day on Face Book, planned out and discussed. I couldn't help but smile, when I heard Zuckerberg or Parker brainstorming on ideas like tagging ""where you can label your friends or family members in pictures"" or when Zuckerberg comes up with the idea to add relationship status to profiles. The film is surprisingly solid due to the fine work by the entire cast, the smart screenplay and the fine direction by David Fincher (Seven, Zodiac).

  Other than that, the film is over-rated, it's a good film about Facebook but I wouldn't call it a classic or the best film of 2010. While, even the music is over-rated. The score works for the movie but other than that it's nothing too special. I think my 7 year old niece could play it on a piano lol. Inception's score, now that was something special and it should have won the Oscar.",1287532800,2,2252,4.775773195876289
4067739,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Well there's no surprise that Mark Zuckerberg didn't give the film his personal seal of approval: he's portrayed as a technological psychopath who is at once obsessed, jealous, disloyal, socially inept and in desperate need of approval. Yet the movie doesn't paint him as completely irredeemable - his entire character arc is bookended by his ex-girlfriend telling him he's an (expletive) at the beginning, and a lawyer at the end telling he's not but he's trying really hard to be.

Plotwise, beyond an intriguing look at Zuckerberg, there are plenty of loose ends in the movie which I suspect is an artifact of the true story it's based on. It's fascinating how the world's most successful social platform was developed by someone who has no social skills and no real qualms about stealing ideas. The script successfully juggles quite a few different ideas about what makes him tick. Zuckerberg stops at nothing to get noticed and belong to some exclusive club, almost at the expense of everything else, so the film is less about Facebook and more about his desire to fit in.

If you're used to Fincher's innovative camera moves and special effects, don't hold your breath here - with the exception of the ""twinning"" of Armie Hammer, it's shot with real conservatism. But this isn't a story that needs Fight Club-quality editing and effects - it's the performances of the lead actors that really stand out, and an Oscar nomination must surely be in the mail for Jesse Eisenberg. He appears in practically every single scene and carries off a highly nuanced performance. But the entire supporting cast is excellent too and even Justin Timberlake is perfect as Sean Parker.

So I'm starting to think that David Fincher is the most interesting director in Hollywood. I hated Alien 3, loved Fight Club, have a guilty attraction to The Game, had mixed feelings about Zodiac, and thought Social Network was the most brilliant character study he's shown us to date. He's a flexible, dedicated director who seems to try completely different material every time, and provides a refreshing voice in the tsunami of remakes and sequels.",1287446400,4,2126,4.949579831932773
4067740,4,B0034G4P7Q,"In ""Social Network,"" Jesse Eisenberg blossoms into an Academy-Award-worthy actor. His performance as Facebook-founder Mark Zuckerberg is, by turns, clammy, cold, vacant, snarky, and mean, as it should be. If this were a better film, I'd watch it again just to savor Eisenberg's performance.

Zuckerberg's/Eisenberg's perfect foils, Cameron and Tyler, the Winklevoss twins, are both played by Armie Hammer, and his performance is also noteworthy. The Winklevoss twins were Harvard students and Olympic athletes from old, WASP money. Actor Armie Hammer is himself from old money. He plays the Winklevoss twins without irony - just, here I am, tall, gorgeous, blond, athletic, brilliant, rich, a superman product of WASP breeding. Given how the politically correct cultural elite of the US has demonized its WASP founders, it's amazing that the twins are not portrayed as bad guys here. They're not good guys, they're just really lucky genetic freaks / Aryan Gods. They are also shown to value old fashioned concepts like honor in business.

That a nerdy, super-smart, manipulative, romantically unsuccessful Jewish kid, Zuckerberg, requires establishment WASP princes and ubermenschen like the Winklevosses to sponsor him, and that the Jewish kid eventually manages, through his triumphant sneakiness and cleverness and litigation, to screw the WASP princes over, is a timeworn tale treated many times before, significantly in Lion Feuchtwanger's ""Jud Suss."" Given how many times storytellers have gone to this well, given the explosive and indeed deadly stereotypes at play, I wish that director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin had ventured anything probing or original here, but they do not.

""The Social Network"" is every bit like the subjects it treats. The film is desperately needy, and it works too hard. The film is very loud. Characters often exchange key dialogue in clubs with loud music in the background. The dialogue features, every few seconds, a sarcastic retort.

Every scene shouts at the viewer: SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN YOU AND THEY ATTEND EXCLUSIVE PARTIES AND MAKE MONEY YOU CAN'T EVEN DREAM OF. And snort coke off hard-bellied coeds and bungee jump into built-in swimming pools and are serviced by crazed groupies in the stalls of men's rooms. Then they betray each other, and their lives are not always fully emotionally satisfying. You know, I got all that the first time the movie told me, and I really didn't need it repeated over and over and over and over again. The final scene of ""The Social Network"" is unbelievably cheap. If anyone tells you he was moved by that final scene, that person needs to get out more. It's a blatant, failed, attempt at a ""rosebud"" scene.

I liked the film at first, but it really doesn't have anything new to say that I didn't know before I went in, and I was really eager for it to finish up. What, besides Dutch angles and noir cinematography, separates a film like ""The Social Network"" from a masterpiece, also about ambition, its rewards and costs, like ""Sweet Smell of Success"" or ""Citizen Kane""? I think those who made those classics managed distance between themselves and their subjects. Orson Welles did not fall under Hearst's spell.

Fincher and Sorkin appear to be very much in thrall to the smarts, power, and money they want to skewer, but never really do. ""Look at this man! He's much smarter than you! He's much richer than you! And pity him because his social life is not as good as yours!"" They shout.

But then they don't give you any reason to care about this film except its zombie dedication to money and power. ""The Social Network"" says nothing about the power of facebook, or how it's changing society, or even if it is. Scenes exploring those questions would not be as cool as scenes of snorting coke off a blond teenager's belly, or watching one rich man screw over another.

Finally, there's a miracle story here that no one making the film is interested in pursuing, but that shines through, in spite of the film's lust for decadent wealth. Mark Zuckerberg really is smarter than you or I. That's a very wonderful thing. It's also a wonderful thing that he managed to find his way to 21st century Harvard. Had Zuckerberg been born in a mud hut in any number of locales and centuries, his abundant gift at manipulating zeros and ones would have been wasted, or even a curse. That Zuckerberg's gift was allowed to flower in capitalist America is a much bigger story than the pettiness, excess and spite the filmmakers insist on focusing on. Zuckerberg's gift, like Gates' and Jobs', etc, will live on long after he and his cofounders and fellow travelers and everyone who envied these guys or wished them dead is forgotten.",1287273600,3,4741,4.939774153074028
4067741,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network is a classical tale of power and revenge. It begins in 2003 at Harvard, where undergraduate Mark Zuckerberg invents the vast social networking website Facebook. Director David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) intersperses Mark's upward trajectory with scenes from two lawsuits against him, one from his friend and co-founder Eduardo Saverin and one from classmates Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

Aaron Sorkin, also a playwright, adapted this outstanding script from Ben Mezrich's mostly true book The Accidental Billionares. Language is as central to this film as it is to any play. Conversations are the equivalent of car chases. In spite of its cleverness, the dialogue remains remarkably natural.

The fast talk is aided by snappy editing and pumping music, which sometimes turns as ominous as the darkly lit Harvard campus. Even glamorized scenes of elite parties are shot in somber tones. Further visual ingenuity is evinced in one scene in which the camera makes the world of a rowing race look like a perfect toyland. This athletic struggle mimics the characters' overarching business battles.

Impeccably cast, The Social Network is also a fascinating character study. Played by Jesse Eisenberg, Mark's intelligence and drive dominate the story. So brilliant he occasionally comes across as an evil genius, Mark is lonely, self-centered, and contemptuous. (His outfits consist of hoodies and sandals.) This protagonist's tragic flaws allow him everything but friendship.

The film is tilted towards Mark's former friend Eduardo (Andrew Garfield). While his decency and victimization are overemphasized, the character is quite believable and certainly sympathetic.

Also interesting are the amusing Winklevoss twins, played by Armie Hammer (thanks to incredible special effects). Tall and gorgeous, these Olympic class rowers resemble Olympians. They may be entitled, but their plight is understandable.

Even Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), the creator of Napster and the man who seduces Mark into a larger life, comes across as more pathetic than villainous. Sean has surface charm and appreciates Facebook's potential, but he is at best unreliable and sophomoric.

Smaller parts are likewise well acted, including Mark's level headed and thus brief girlfriend (Rooney Mara) and the twins' furious friend Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The only misstep is Rashida Jones as a (gorgeous) lawyer who is bizarrely compassionate to Mark, in an apparent attempt to make him more likable.

Certain aspects of the story are sexed up and simplified. Only the exclusive side of Harvard is explored. Most disturbing is that the characters on which The Social Network is based are still alive. Though mixing fact and fiction can be dubious, the creators of the film performed extensive research and invited everyone to give their input. Understandably, Mark Zuckerberg declined to participate.

Fast paced, hilarious, and parabolic, The Social Network will ensnare many into its world of competition and self-destruction. It is an excellent portrayal of Internet and youth culture in all its innovation, imagination, selfishness, and insolence. Amongst questions of class and control, we watch Mark and others chase after a sense of happiness that is ultimately hollow.",1287187200,4,3282,5.534930139720559
4067742,5,B0034G4P7Q,"""Social Network"" is a riveting movie, a Hollywood version of the true story of a smart but struggling Harvard student, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) , and the crafty, determined ego that drives him to win Facebook fame and billions of dollars.  ""Social Network"" engrosses from the get-go, it is a fascinating look at privileged college students that grew up with the computer and  Internet.  Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest American billionaire, because he became the entrepreneur who co-founded the social networking site Facebook.  The story shows Zuckerberg, along with fellow classmates Dustin Moskovitz (Joseph Mazzello), and Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield),  starting Facebook.  In its infancy was just a project showing pictures of college girls rated for ""hotness"" -by downloading college campus photos, he caused a security breach at Harvard and one of many times Zuckerberg is pulled in front of authorities.  Zuckerberg remains unfazed and sticks to developing and turning Facebook into a mega power and money phenomenon.  One put-off is that the movie has a arrogance or chill in its treatment of women.  There is a feeling that all the men are misogynist, although Zuckerberg seems to have a lasting crush on Erica Allbright (Rooney Mara).  He messes up his chances with crass and arrogant remarks on a date.  He is just socially inept, but a genius on the computer.

As things evolve and get complicated, more people are interested in Facebook,  Enter Justin Timberlake, who plays Sean Parker, the founder of Napster.  He meets with and impresses  Mark Zuckerberg as he validates all it can be.  This is the start of conflict and stress for the CFO, Eduardo Saverin.

Both Eisenberg and Timberlake's  performances are spot-on, fascinating and wonderful to watch.  All the cast does an excellent job  with well-developed characters, a smart script and recent historical relevance.  It has all the human emotions of greed, obsession, entitlement, and unrequited love.  There are legal battles on intellectual property, who is back-stabbing who, and all  punctuated by Eisenberg's fantastic acting, delivery of complicated emotions with exceptional originality..

The drama is interesting, the pace of the movie is fast and smart.  A very enjoyable drama as well as a peek into the web generation's way of life.",1287187200,4,2328,5.277929155313352
4067743,5,B0034G4P7Q,This is by far one of the most amazing movies I've seen so far. I don't see any other movie being able to top this one in a long time. All the hype around it is totally justified. The actors did a great job! I loved the portrayal of Mark by Jesse. This movie is definitely a must see!,1287014400,2,284,3.830508474576271
4067744,5,B0034G4P7Q,"""The Social Network""--when you leave this fine film, you feel as though for a couple of hours you've inhabited an alternate universe. The movie pulls you into this world of a needy nerd who, though ironically anti-social and essentially heartless invented the biggest social networking website ever. In the early part of the movie you are casketed (an almost claustrophobic milieu) in the total world of Harvard. It's a tight society made up of what will become the country's elite.
The filmmaking is exceptional and unlike any other I can recall seeing. The editing is particularly sharp and striking with cross-editing of scenes from Mark Zuckerberg's past at Harvard and his present, in which he is giving depositions in two different cases. The twins and his original business partner are suing him. (Jesse Eisenberg does a great job portraying this self-absorbed techie.) Not only was he anti-social, but he didn't mind jettisoning his friends or classmates when it served his purposes.
The acting is for the most part excellent but the portrayal of the twins is closer to caricature than character realization. It shows Zuckerberg often swilling beer and being teed off because he wasn't accepted by the best clubs at the university. Wild college parties are shown as a backdrop to the formation of this site.
It's interesting that the membership of today's very democratic website was first only for the elite, exclusively at Harvard; then a few Ivy League schools and Stanford were included. How the privileged gulled the ordinary people is instructive, but also instructive is how these guys gulled each other.
Justin Timberlake, I think, gives a way too over-the-top performance as the founder of Napster who climbs aboard the Facebook money-making machine.
Compare Zuckerberg with the kid in ""The Graduate"" of 1967 and see how far our younger generation has progressed or regressed.
This is a brilliant piece of cinema-creation which captures a certain type of person that computers have spawned. When Mark is rejected by his girl, he decides to get back at her publicly in a nasty fashion through biting comments on his blog. He may have been the first cyber-bully. By all means, see this movie for many reasons. It's spell-binding, entertaining, and enlightening.",1287014400,4,2276,5.120967741935484
4067745,4,B0034G4P7Q,"This propulsive 2010 film is probably the most conspicuous case of product placement in recent Hollywood memory. Director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin prove to be a particularly effective team in bringing to vivid life the somewhat trite story of the betrayal behind a Web site that reshaped the chore of networking into the zeitgeist of the online community reaching 500 million participants. The irony is that the movie is not really about the Facebook phenomenon itself but its opaque creator, nineteen-year-old Mark Zuckerberg, a socially impervious Harvard-based hacker extraordinaire whom the creators would have you believe developed Facebook as a way to get back at the girl who dumped him and the elitists who rejected him. However, Sorkin is far too shrewd to turn this into a simple revenge story. Instead, he uses these factors as catalysts in his inspiration to ignite the basic need we have to judge other people in the safe haven of a site populated by people who are otherwise socially disconnected.

The story's framing device centers around the detailed depositions given in two concurrent lawsuits against Zuckerberg - one filed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, identical twins and star members of Harvard's rowing team, along with their business partner Divya Narendra, and the other filed by Eduardo Saverin, Zuckerberg's former best friend. The Winklevoss twins filed a suit claiming they originated the idea for Facebook when Zuckerberg agreed to help them build a Harvard-only community site. The second suit cuts deeper in that Saverin, a Facebook co-founder, finds his ownership in the company cut from a third to one-tenth of one percent. The decision is not without merit since Saverin's singular determination in eliciting advertisers to the site did nothing to help the site gain popularity. At the same time, it reflected Zuckerberg's socially inert nature - whether true or not - showing he is incapable of maintaining a deep friendship not out of malice or greed but because he has the unrelenting fortitude to recognize he has a better idea to code and implement despite the personal consequences. It's a fascinating conundrum that requires Fincher's emotionally precise direction to make it work effectively.

In a tough role, Jesse Eisenberg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventureland/dp/B002BFBAWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventureland</a>) plays Zuckerberg close to the vest by showing sparks of humanity with measured acuity. It's a well-observed performance that relies on keeping a clear distance from the viewer. Justin Timberlake does well in the showy supporting role of Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a savvy, paranoid poseur whose bona fide sleaziness provides the impetus Facebook needs to turn it into a global phenomenon. However, it's Andrew Garfield who gives the movie the little heart it has as Saverin simply because we feel his devastation in missing a once-in-anyone's-lifetime opportunity by trusting a friend whom he thought had his back. There are sharp, near-cameo turns by Douglas Urbanski as Harvard president Larry Summers, contemptuously arrogant in his dismissal of the Winklevoss' plea for support in their case against Zuckerberg; Rooney Mara who makes her character's numbing rejection of Zuckerberg palpable; and Rashida Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-You-Man/dp/B001PR0Y6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love You, Man</a>) as a junior defense attorney who provides Zuckerberg the only honest summation of his legal chances to win. Fincher has made an intentionally cool, often detached film, compounded by a jarring Trent Reznor/Atticus Ross score, but the hope of making a real, honest connection always seem to be within reach.",1287014400,3,3811,5.695957820738137

This is a brilliant, smart and interesting drama that keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat, as well. This is a well-made film that is better than most of the films out there, recently.

This is also one of the best films of the year and it is a film that will be remembered when Oscar time comes around.",1286841600,4,4469,5.094133697135061
4067747,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I must start off by admitting that this movie exceeded my expectations. I was at first uncertain how much I was going to like the movie because I read online that the actual Mark Zuckerberg bluntly stated that the movie is a piece of fiction, and that he wished that the movie was not made while he was still alive [...]. I decided to give it a chance once my husband convinced me to see it because my husband has good taste in movies. This movie was definitely one where both my husband and I felt that time flew by. This movie basically paints a good picture of the circumstances leading up to the creation to facebook and the major players instrumental in the creation.  Jesse Eisenberg masterfully portrays a very highly intelligent Mark Zuckerberg who seems to be very shocked but suprisingly calm when he gets sued by Eduardo Saverin (eloquently played by Andrew Garfield), the Winklevoss twins (played by Armie Hammer), and Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The movie cleverly portrays events leading up to why he got sued, and it honestly left me wondering if there could have been a better way for things to get resolved. The reason why I title the review Soap Opera because it did portray the main characters in an exciting way as men who liked to love and have fun like everyone else. For one, the movie portrays some of the women that might have been romantically involved with them (Eduardo and Mark). In addition the audience is treated to an interesting story on how Mark and Eduardo may have met the Napster founder and Facebook Co-founder Sean Parker (wonderfully played by Justin Timberlake). Justine Timberlake does a very fine job as portraying Sean Parker as a very creative, talented, and controversial man. An October 7th, 2010 article in La Times online reads that Sean Parker has recently given $100,000 to the ballot initiative that would legalize marijuana in California.[...] After watching this movie I can honestly understand why Mark Zuckerberg did not want a movie about him while still alive. The main reason is because although I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it may have been an invasion of privacy if the movie is possibly close to some of the events that played out in his life. I'm saying this from the perspective of if he (Mark) did not give his full permission to make the movie. In addition, the movie portrays him to be extremely smart, but needing to have more compassion towards people. The only catch with this portrayal is that some people may appear to have a tough and hardened exterior, but are actually craving to be accepted and understood inside. I have myself personally encountered people who appeared to be abrasive on the outside, but were actually compassionate deep down, but felt like they had to potray a hardened exterior to protect themselves until they had compelling reasons to show their more calm side. Regardless of how you are going to feel about the characters, I can safely say that this movie is definitely an engaging type of soap opera to watch regardless of how close to true life events it is.",1286755200,5,3068,4.745318352059925
4067748,4,B0034G4P7Q,"Social Network a movie, an unauthorized biopic about Mark Zuckerberg.  There is also an actual person, Mark Zuckerberg, who created Facebook. I have no way of telling how accurate this movie is. He might be a great, unfairly maligned guy. All I can do is review the character in the movie, as presented.

The Zuckerberg character is played well by Jessie Eisenberg. Zuckerberg, as portrayed, is a brilliant but antisocial IT geek at Harvard. Early in the movie he is in a restaurant with a girl he hopes will be his girlfriend Erica, a Boston University student. He arrogantly informs her he will get into one of Harvard's exclusive clubs (like fraternities) and bring her and that will make her socially successful, which is what she wants(!) Then he goes on to allude she won't have to study very hard in school because she's going to BU not Harvard(!) After a bunch of the rude, arrogant, patronizing, rapid-fire speech, she dumps him and leaves, not before telling him he will think girls reject him because he is a nerd, not because he is rude, thoughtless, a-hole, (or words to that effect). Zuckerberg goes back to his room and vindictively trashes the girl publically on his Blog site. This scene shows Zuckerberg and sets the tone for the whole movie.

Zuckerberg sets up a web site, FaceMash, at Harvard where guys can look at pictures of female students and rate which one is hotter than the other and make a pecking order of hotness. It soon overwhelms Harvards computers and enraged women and It administrators get the site shut down. The plot gets more elaborate. Zuckerberg has one true friend at Harvard the rich(er) student Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), a Business Major who advises Zuckerberg and recognizes the facebook idea has commercial potential and lends him money and becomes a stockholder in his corporation.

This happens very early, I'm not giving away too much plot. The rest of the movie is ironic, the creator of the world's largest social network is himself brilliant but a rude nerd, patronizing, argumentative, self absorbed, vindictive, hateful, hypercompetitive and antisocial. His character is very much like Sheldon on ""Big Bang Theory"" except Zuckerberg lacks Sheldon's charm and Sheldon, for all his funny self-absorbed faults, is never that vindictive and hateful.

Zuckerberg has made Facebook the rest is two hours or court cases of people who think Zuckerberg has screwed them over or ones he actually has, his only friend. It's not a pretty picture. Zuckerberg is increasingly nasty. Eduardo is the only likeable sympathetic character in the movie.

The movie is interesting, very tautly directed and well acted. Insightful. Actor Jessie Eisenberg does a great job of portraying Zuckerberg, the man you love to hate. The movie is a great character study. The director makes this very, very wordy movie flow along through the court cases and flashbacks of Zuckerberg with rapid-fire speech and rapid-fire editting. I separate the high quality of acting and direction in this movie from the abrasiveness of it's characters. Someone has said to be a CEO, you have to be a sociopath. A social network creator with no friends. Ironic, don't you think?

Plot is a bit like Citizen Kane, but without Kane's spectacular camera work, and Zuck is never sympathetic at all, whereas Charles Foster Kane was, initially.",1286668800,3,3356,4.992844364937389
4067749,4,B0034G4P7Q,"In the last scene of The Social Network, an attractive attorney who is working on Mark Zuckerberg's case, has to turn down an offer to go grab something to eat with him and he is left sitting alone in an office conference room.  He's the lonely young billionaire.

I find Mark Zuckerberg, the creator of Facebook, and the main character in The Social Network, to be a fascinating fellow--at least as he's played in the movie.  He doesn't always come across as likeable in the movie, but he is always interesting.  Zuckerberg is one of those people who is absolutely brilliant and yet he is socially awkward.  It might even be fair to describe him as, socially, somewhat unaware.

Most of us have known someone who was frighteningly smart in terms of basic intelligence and yet the person didn't know how to get along very well with other people.  Right?  It's the person with the genius IQ who has trouble having an ordinary conversation involving small talk.  That's Zuckerberg.

This is established in the very first scene of the movie.  In this scene, Zuckerberg and his girlfriend, Erica, are sitting in a bar on the campus of Harvard University and after he bothers, annoys, and, even, insults her, she tells us him that she is going to her dorm to study and that she is no longer his girlfriend.

That's not a great way to end the evening.

The scene unfolds with some snappy dialogue that involves Erica telling Mark that dating him is ""exhausting"" because, she says, ""going out with you is like dating a Stairmaster.""

Their exchange ends with Erica delivering this zinger: ""Listen, you're going to be successful and rich.  But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek.  And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true.  It'll be because you're an... #x@*&!""

This movie was interesting to me because of the Mark Zuckerberg character, in addition to that, the creation of Facebook is an interesting story.  In fact, the whole phenomenon of Facebook is fascinating to me.  Why do certain things catch on?  Facebook started at Harvard University and initially was opened selectively to various other universities.  At every university where it was made available thousands of students signed up within days.  Why is that the case?

Social networks already existed prior to Facebook, it was not a new concept.  Even the exclusivity of Facebook, which is highlighted in the movie as an important ingredient to its success, wasn't a new concept.  So, why did it catch on so effectively and ultimately bypass other social networks, like MySpace, which had a great head start?

[If you know the answers to those questions, by the way, you might be ""billionaire"" material.]

I found the story of Facebook to be told in a compelling way in The Social Network.  And, believe me, it's amazing that I've used the word ""compelling"" about a movie that does not contain a single explosion.  In fact, at no time during the movie was the word ""kung fu"" ever mentioned, and I still liked it.  Maybe I'm growing up, huh?  [Oh wait...what was I thinking?  That can't be it.]

Ultimately, though, there was a sort of sad irony to the movie.  Mark creates the world's most successful online social networking site allowing millions of people to be connected and, yet, he winds up being sued by the friends that he makes along the way, including his best friend.

At the end of the movie some follow-up type of information about several characters was provided in text on the screen.  The last bit of this follow-up information stated that Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire.  And we're reminded that a person can be very rich and still be lonely, in which case we have to wonder: Are you really rich?

The acting must be very good but since I don't know these real life characters I'm going to give room for exaggerations and hyperboles. The dialogues are really good but the legalese must be close to what it was. The irony was very well played out as well. The movie did not give me any sort of compulsion to read the book though just enjoy the ride.

4067751,3,B0034G4P7Q,"The central premise of THE SOCIAL NETWORK is that Facebook emerged not from an attempt by a college kid to connect with his friends, as the origin myth has it, but from a misogynist online prank.  The title speaks to the profound irony underlying this almost accidental invention: The man who created the world's largest and most successful social network is devoid of social intelligence.

This image of the world's youngest billionaire is far from pretty. But it's not just Mark Zuckerberg (well acted by Jesse Eisenberg) that Social Network lampoons. Harvard University comes across as a hornet's nest of elitism, greed, and misogyny. It's hard to sympathize with anyone here, except perhaps Eduardo Saverin, presented as Zuckerberg's only friend, whom he betrays.

Saverin's sympathetic portrayal owes to the fact that he was the only person connected with Facebook to consult with Ben Mezrich, author of the 2009 book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Accidental-Billionaires-The-Founding-of-Facebook-A-Tale-of-Sex-Money-Genius-and-Betrayal/dp/0307740986/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook: A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal</a>&nbsp;from which the film is adapted.

The central plot device is flash-forwards to Zuckerberg's testimony at a legal deposition. He is being sued by both Saverin and Harvard twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who claim he stole their creative idea. (Zuckerberg settled both lawsuits out of court; Saverin now owns 5  percent of the privately held company, while the Winklevosses got $65 million.)

Despite the obvious distortion of the deposition scenes (in real life, everyone involved in a lawsuit does not sit around a big table inserting commentary while a witness is being deposed), the device works not only to anchor the flashbacks but also to remind the viewer of the film's essential accuracy.

But, ironically, this film is far from accurate. Although many of the bizarre details are factual, several of the central elements are entirely fictional. Zuckerberg did not, for example, get dumped by a girlfriend. He now lives with the same woman he was dating before he launched Facebook. (If you are interested in a complete rundown of what's fact and what's fantasy, check out a column at The Daily Beast by veteran journalist David Kirkpatrick, author of the nonfiction book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Facebook-Effect-The-Inside-Story-of-the-Company-That-Is-Connecting-the-World/dp/1439102112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World</a>. Also, the New Yorker's Jose Antonio Vargas recently profiled Zuckerberg in an article, ""The Face of Facebook."")

This shameless blending of fact and fiction that is so characteristic of Hollywood makes me uneasy. Are we watching a true story, or the bitter memories of a sore loser?

Nonetheless, with its outstanding direction (by David Fincher), compelling script, and excellent acting, The Social Network is well worth seeing. And with the Facebook network now boasting more than 500 million active users worldwide, it's certainly interesting to ponder its socially disconnecting effect, a central irony of the digital age.",1286236800,19,3330,6.038135593220339
4067752,5,B0034G4P7Q,"What do you get when you blend an excellent script, superb acting, astute directing and a razor-sharp soundtrack? ""The Social Network"".  This is a movie with Oscar written all over it.  I won't be surprised if it gets several Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, including Outstanding Actor (Jesse Eisenberg), Screenplay (Aaron Sorkin), Soundtrack (Trent Reznor), Best Director (David Fincher) and Best Picture.

Eisenberg does an excellent job of portraying Mark Zuckerman, the brainchild behind the development of Facebook.  Whether at school or on-the-job, we've all known someone with Zuckerman's style: a sarcastic, nerdy, know-it-all who knows just how to get under your skin.  Eisenberg succeeded in achieving all these traits.  At times, I wanted to reach into the picture and grab him by the throat.

The main plot theme revolves around the creation of Facebook, which had previous incarnations with the names of Facemash and THE Facebook.  Zuckerman and his friend & Harvard classmate Eduardo Sevarin are recognized as the original cofounders of Facebook, but that fact is actually brought into question by other Harvard students who come forward saying Zuckerman actually stole their idea.  So did he or didn't he?

Justin Timberlake plays the role of Sean Parker of Napster fame.  He is able to motivate Zuckerman to move to California to set up shop.  Timberlake does a fine job of portraying a suave young businessman with used car salesman-like tactics and questionable motives.

Trent Reznor, the frontman for Nine Inch Nails, is responsible for the exemplary soundtrack featured in the film.  The unique, well-paced music adds an air of suspense to what could otherwise be considered average scenes.  I don't usually pay a whole lot of attention to the soundtrack unless it's full of classic rock or pop songs, but Reznor's nicely crafted sounds add a unique feel to the movie.

Bottom line: This deftly told, smartly acted story of an anti-social Harvard nerd-turned-CEO is one of the best films of the year.",1286236800,2,2033,5.190184049079755
4067753,3,B0034G4P7Q,"WARNING, SOME SPOILERS.

HIAKU SUMMARY:
Hmm... Facebook movie
Somehow less engaging than
I had expected

I'll admit I quite enjoyed this film while watching at the theatre, but however on the walk to the LRT station after, the novelty was soon wearing off, as all I could think about was the major missed opportunities. Minus the Benjamin Button adaptation (which sucked), I'd never have thought that this would happen with a Fincher flick. And furthermore, I was quite baffled to log on and see all the glowing reviews of this film. Really? an 8.7??

This isn't a bad film strictly speaking, but it isn't a good one either. It's dialogue is great, as is the music by Trent Reznor (I loved the funky Hall Of The Mountain King in the race scene, and as is the acting and directing, so I really can't come down on it hard on the fact that it's, for the most part, a well made film.

Of course there's going to be award buzz for this film, it was directed by David Fincher. The acting is really great, in fact it's PHENOMENAL. The best thing about the acting (and the entire film) is Andrew Garfield's performance, as I will be baffled if he doesn't get nominated.

Now like I said, I enjoyed it while I was watching it. But lately I've been thinking about it and I can't say it's a very good film.

The film skips back and forth between the trial and the events which surrounded the making of The Facebook. This works in the first half, hut then once Sean Parker comes in, it gets annoying, as the cutting back and forth becomes increasingly constant. Why can't you just show the whole unadulterated scene? Is it really that important to show Eduardo saying it as opposed to the words come out of Sean Parker's mouth, or to show Eduardo saying ""Then he said"" then cut to Sean Parker? If you're gonna cut back and forth and ruin the suspense of a scene, why even include it at all?

This is an example of the ""patches"".I mentioned in the title. The film is patched together as opposed to having a seamless story being told. 75% of the film takes place in the office during the lawsuits and depositions. At this point the suspense is ruined for us because we already know Eduardo is suing mark. So why give it away early in the if you *want* to give the audience a reason to care about the characters?

Another thing wrong with the film is that the theme isn't easily made across very easily. The most glaring example is a powerful scene near the end where Eduardo, the jealous soul, gives Mark, a jerk, hell for offering him a below-cost check. It's powerful, it's well acted, even hard to watch. But it's missing the most important thing: The overall theme. We don't get anything about jealousy and/or greed. At the end, We see Mark add his former girlfriend add her as a friend on facebook. Does this say anything about the ass he really is? About how crap of a boyfriend he is and even furthermore, how crappy of a businessman he is, that he became the youngest billionaire in the world for the wrong reasons? No. It doesn't say anything about being an ass. Like I said, the theme is missing.

In short, this isn't a bad film. Like I said it's well shot, acted, and directed, but it's not a good film either- when it's good it's good, when it's bad, it's bad. I think IMDb needs to overhaul its rating system, as how this has a rating of 8.7 baffles me.",1286150400,2,3353,4.395161290322581
4067754,5,B0034G4P7Q,"It's always a special thrill to see a movie that takes an actor and perfectly melds him to a role.  Particularly when it happens for the first time for that actor.  Young Jesse Eisenberg has at last had this happen to him in David Fincher's fun and super-smart THE SOCIAL NETWORK.  Eisenberg plays Facebook ""founder"" (I put that in quotes, because the whole movie is somewhat about the idea that perhaps all the credit is NOT due) Mark Zuckerberg.  In the past, Eisenberg has excelled at the smart nerd, the awkward guy who never does well with the ladies because he's just a little bit unconventional looking and a little bit smarter than everyone else.  In ADVENTURE LAND, he was funny but I didn't find him entirely convincing.  His character was a smart**s, but you also felt he would probably always be a bit of a loser.  I didn't completely warm up to him.  In the excellent ZOMBIELAND, he played his part very well, but let's face it...his role never had ""Award season darling"" written on it.

However, as the difficult to like Zuckerberg, Eisenberg takes Aaron Sorkin's sharp, almost preternaturally smart dialogue and knocks it out of the park.  Zuckerberg, as presented here, is deeply unlikeable, because he's the smartest guy on campus but also deeply insecure.  He speaks his mind, which is often unpleasant...because he does so in the most condescending ways possible.  He doesn't intend to be a jerk...but he doesn't intend NOT to be either.  Eisenberg fires on all cylinders here...and it was a blast to watch.

Equally exciting was to enjoy virtually all the other performances as well.  Most sympathetic was Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin, the CFO of Facebook...and Zuckerberg's only true friend.  His Saverin comes across as slightly fussy and old-fashioned...but with sincere motives and a heart-on-his-sleeve attitude towards business.  It's an attitude that we admire, even as we see it is so totally wrong for the high paced business of the not so distant past when Facebook sprung into being at the height of our economic success in the early 2000s.  He believes that friendship and honesty mean something...and is run over because of it.  The guiltiest pleasures came from Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker, the founder of Napster.  He's a high-flying huckster.  A womanizer and charmer...clearly super smart and marketing savvy...but he also oozes insincerity.  Timberlake must now be considered a full-blown actor...not just a charming performer of self-effacing sketches on SNL.  He utterly steals the scenes he is in...and he has no compunction about being even more unlikeable than Zuckerberg.  While the performance is not exactly a revelation (it doesn't stretch him THAT much)...it can't be ignored or laughed-off either.  I also enjoyed Armie Hammer as the Winklevoss Twins...some of the folks from whom Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea of Facebook.

THE SOCIAL NETWORK essentially tells the story of the development of Facebook.  It works on a big, social commentary stage...showing us WHY the human race seems to be wired to embrace such a ""network.""  If you explain to someone what Facebook is...it sounds trite and self-serving.  But in reality, it has woven itself into the fabric of society.  But THE SOCIAL NETWORK is about personal disappointment, achievement, betrayal and entitlement.  If Spiderman was supposed to know that ""with great power comes great responsibility"", someone needed to tell Zuckerberg that with great intelligence comes great responsibility.  He's like a super-hero of coding.  But he's a villain when it comes to dealing with others.  We see strong friendships collapse, partnerships fray and desires corrupt.

Fincher, over the years, has shown himself to be a director of great style.  Certainly in works such as SEVEN, FIGHT CLUB & PANIC ROOM, his style has enabled him to overcome stories that wouldn't have worked in less technically skilled hands.  And he's had a knack for casting just the right folks to help him out.  But those movies were entertainments...a story about a serial killer, a home invasion and a group of guys who beat each other up (yes, I know some think FIGHT CLUB had social commentary to offer...but that commentary was not exactly new and original...just presented in a new and original way).  With ZODIAC, Fincher tackled a true story that sprawled across years and personalities.  It was very well made, but was also often turgid and needlessly focused on miniscule details.  With THE SOCIAL NETWORK, Fincher has polished his craft.  It always moves fast.  It focuses on details (such as Severin & Zuckerberg talking about algorithms), but with such verve and authority that it never bores.  It follows a true story, but with the rhythms of fiction.  And Sorkin, whose writing often makes me think this is what Neil Simon scripts would have sounded like if he'd written political stories instead of romantic comedies, has actually wrestled this story into a compelling package.  His writing always makes everyone sound much smarter than anyone is in real life (just as Simon made folks sound FUNNIER than anyone is in real life)...but here, he's got characters that we actually believe COULD talk this way.

I wasn't sure I would like this film.  I don't use Facebook myself (yet) and I just wasn't convinced I could like a film all about the rich brats who invented it and then squabbled about it.  But after enjoying the excellent script and near Oscar caliber performances...I left knowing I'd thoroughly enjoyed one of the best films of the year thus far.",1286150400,4,5562,5.039430449069004
4067755,1,B0034G4P7Q,"This film is based on how Facebook was created and all the characters who are involved.
I mostly saw this film based on the good reviews that I read. But I found nothing brilliant about this film at all. My biggest problem with the film was the protagonist Mark Zuckerberg. If I had known that the Mark Zuckerberg character was so nasty and revolting. I would not have watched the film. He's mean, rude, condescending and treacherous.

The only thing that prevented me from walking out on the film after the first ten minutes (where Zuckerberg posts  crude disparaging remarks about his ex-girlfriend online) was curiosity. I don't mind villains and I don't mind `bad boys' ( I actually liked Timberlake's character). But Zuckerberg has no redeemable qualities at all. He's just a straight up unlikable creep.

The film actually made me think that it was an updated and modernized version of Mordecai Richlers' `The Apprentiship of Duddy Kravitz'. Like Kravitz Zuckerberg uses people and is baffled by their hurt.

The only saving grace in this film for me was Andrew Garfield as Eduardo Saverin. Whom I found to be sweet and too nave for his own good. Part of me actually wonders  (considering the wealth Zuckerberg has gained from Facebook)  if the producers are really just sticking it to the man.",1286064000,24,1300,4.833333333333333
4067756,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Before I review the film, I would like to mention that I do have Facebook account, and its sole purpose is to allow friends who I have lost touch with - and who live all over the United States, and the world - to find me if they want to. I also have a extremely rare ethnic last name and no one in the entire world of 6 billion+ people has the same first and last name, which makes my name unique, so I carefully guard my privacy. I have the barest of personal info on Facebook and the highest of security settings. I also spend close to zero percent of my time socializing or keeping track of people I know through Facebook or other social networking sites. Why? As the Social Network makes perfectly clear: Nothing, but nothing, takes the place of real, live people in face-to-face relationships!

After watching Social Contract it left me feeling both amazed at Mr. Zuckerberg's good instincts and his fortitude in not letting anyone hold him back and allowing himself to succeed beyond his wildest dreams - and empty -  by his profound loneliness and from the persistent discord that swirled around him throughout almost the entire movie. I also found  irony in the fact that Mr. Zuckerberg did not cooperate in any way with the making of Social Network because it exposed his private life to the world - but, yet, the general public is encouraged to give him (Facebook) as much of our personal information as we can!

Social Network is interesting because you see what a person with good instincts can achieve in the real world. While I don't approve of people mistreating each other, the history of inventing anything important is full of stories like Social Network. For example, lawsuits over patents are a big business, that's why we have an army of ""patent"" attorneys here in the United States! (I also found it so delicious that the founder of Napster, who brought the recording industry down on its knees, played a key role in providing critical good advice to Mr. Zuckerberg's success. I know how malignant the recording industry can be. None other than the legendary Nigerian drummer Baba Olatunji told me a how one the biggest record companies in the world viciously screwed him out of a lot of money!)

Social Contract is mainly about two things: Interpersonal relationships and money. But what is only mentioned at the very end at the story is Mr. Zuckerberg is a billionaire (actually he's a MULTI-billionaire!) With that huge amount of wealth I couldn't help, but wonder, what is he doing with all that money to make the world a better place? At the same time, I kept thinking about the 18-year old gay college student who recently jumped off the George Washington bridge because someone filmed and then posted his same-sex sexual activities all over the internet. He left his suicide note on Facebook! I hope someone close to Mr. Zuckerberg's reads this review and encourages him to start spending some money on organizations that work to strengthen laws that protect a person's privacy and maybe throw a few bucks to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered (GLBT) Suicide Prevention Hotlines around the country, while he's writing checks. They are always struggling for money. It would be a most profound gesture, Mr. Zuckerberg! You could save many young lives!

4067757,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The film The Social Network by David Fincher, was based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich. I have now read the book and seen the film and I found both to be incredibly compelling stories. On the surface, both stories seem pretty identical with some varying bits of info differing between the two as well as different vehicles used for storytelling. As far as the film goes, it was told very well and was very compelling to watch. It was beautifully photographed and the score by Trent Reznor was awesome too, as was the acting.

Despite my having known the entire story from the book, which can often bring about negative film watching results, this film went far further than the simple who, what, when, where, and why details in it. Mark Zuckerberg's girlfriend breaks up with him in the first 5 minutes of the film and I believe this becomes the catalyst for what is driving him in the film. And who knows, perhaps in real life too.

The film is most definitely going to define this time period too, or at least the point in time that something important began, ie; social Internet sites connecting humanity as never before.

A great film about the Internet has not really come about until now and I feel it's because despite the Internet having been around for some time now it has not until recently begun to exploit its full potential.  Facebook and The Social Network show just what the future of the Internet holds, possibilities and pitfalls alike. It's not a business model like Ebay or an information model like Google, but it's a social one. And humans, before business and even information, are social, which is why Facebook can often be so addictive and other sites are not. We socialize before we learn to speak and I feel that the social relevance is at the heart of The Social Network. Although advertising for soda, cars, toys and whatever is what makes Facebook financially viable, ultimately, that's not why we log on. We are there for each other and the ads follow us around like puppies wherever we go.

This is also the story about a single man and a fallible man at that.  Films that show perfect heroes rarely stand the test of time, but imperfect protagonists, people we can all relate to on some level, are the ones we keep revisiting as we grow and age, and hopefully we become wiser in the process. Obviously, I do not know Mark Zuckerberg personally, but I do know myself, the mistakes I've made, and the errors in judgment, the missed opportunities, and the homeruns. It is this very real, fallible, human aspect that I can relate to the most in the film. Mark Zuckerberg seems like a very real character in the film, just like all of us, imperfect. In his case he's still growing, learning about people, and wet behind the ears. Ironically and certainly not lost on the filmmakers one bit, Zuckerberg's social skills have to catch up with his intellect. Everyone should be allowed to stumble some, and hopefully correct themselves.  The fact that the situation was not cut and dry and that he was not simply shown as a genius while everyone around him was shown as an ass was the movie's heart and soul to me. Many of the secondary characters had flaws and imperfections too. Mark, however, is clearly operating on a different level than most people. His lack of social judgment and his growing pains seem a side effect of a mind preoccupied with larger technical issues. Better choices could have been made by him for sure and it seems whatever bad choices were not corrected, were certainly sorted out by the courts.

I wonder if he still has the business card that says ""I'm CEO...b*tch,"" (which seemed somewhat intended towards his ex) or if he has had a new batch made up. Perhaps he will outgrow it and cringe at it someday like we all have done looking back on bad haircuts, funny clothing, bad moments, or poor choices. As the old saying goes, to make an omelet you have to break a few eggs. Mark broke a few along the way for sure, but oh, what an omelet he made.",1285977600,3,4025,4.565096952908587
4067758,5,B0034G4P7Q,"The Social Network seemed to have all the right pieces put together for an outstanding film. With David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) directing and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor  working on the score for the film, it was intriguing the moment it was announced. On the other hand though, it was a film revolving around Facebook. How was that going to work and would something most of use on a daily basis be able to be stretched out into a premise that holds our attention span for roughly two hours? It actually managed to do just that and then some.

The film's powerful script shows its strength from the opening scene. While The Social Network is purely dialogue driven the entire film, it's still incredibly engaging. You get absorbed into the film pretty easily. The main cast is pretty flawless, as well. Jesse Eisenberg may be considered to most as a more serious version of Michael Cera, but that really isn't such a bad thing. His seriousness, quick wit, and intelligence are what drive this film. Even Justin Timberlake steals a few scenes as the rather eccentric entrepreneur that used to own Napster. However, Andrew Garfield seems to be the guy that's really coming into his own. With a film like this under his belt and how impressive his performance was, many of the doubts about him being the next Spider-Man will be put to rest. Add on top of all this David Fincher's ability to not only help put together a fantastic film, but make it look visually appealing as well and you have one of the strongest and most well-rounded out films of the year.

The score is just as fantastic as any NIN or Trent Reznor fan could have hoped. While you could certainly hear Reznor's industrial contributions, that's probably its biggest asset as it helps this score be distinguished from every other movie score out there. It seems like most films since The Dark Knight have all had scores that sounded similar to Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard's Grammy winning score. While The Social Network's score shares that same dark, ambitious, and sometimes ominous tone, it's Reznor's industrial roots that makes the music to the film unique.

There was one aspect of the film that was kind of interesting. If anyone else reading this watches South Park, in the latest season they did an episode revolving around Facebook entitled ""You Have 0 Friends"" that also parodied the film Tron. In that episode, Wendy approaches Stan and asks him if he thinks she is stupid because he has his relationship status on Facebook set as ""Single."" So why is this being mentioned now? This conversation seems like it was nearly lifted verbatim from the South Park episode and put into The Social Network. They are very similar. If you don't watch South Park, it probably won't be much of an issue. But if you do, it's pretty hilarious.

The Social Network is a captivating drama that also offers quite a bit of laughs. Its excellent writing, top notch cast, and superb directing make the film nearly flawless in its execution. The film has the potential to not only make a massive gross at the box office, but also become the film of this generation since everything seems to revolve around social networking these days. If you enjoy explosions, blood and guts, or pulse racing action, then this film probably isn't for you. This will more than likely come off a bit long winded to fans of those types of films. However, this comes highly recommended to those who enjoy intriguing dialogue in their movies that's intertwined with outstanding storytelling. Come award season, this is definitely a front runner.",1285977600,2,3599,4.770465489566613
4067759,5,B0034G4P7Q,"Not a day passes that we don't hear about the problems with privacy on Facebook. However, based on The Social Network, lawsuits from users are petty when complained to the other issues Facebook has had to go through. As it has been proven by the success and diminishing influence of services such as MySpace, with a social networking service, the goal is not to become but remain dominant.

Mark Zuckerberg is the co-founder of Facebook and the youngest billionaire, and a complete Nerd. There is nothing anti-social about Zuckerberg, but there is not a shred of sociability about him, either. He is driven by a mad passion for success. His life centers around Facebook, and anything or anyone that gets in way of his success must be eliminated. Just as the poster of the film indicates, with the countless fans, admirers, and Facebook ""friends"" Zuckerberg has collected, he also has gathered a few enemies-mostly combined of his previous acquaintances and friends.

As the events leading up to the creation and prominence of Facebook are told, Zuckerberg, cofounder Eduardo Saverin and the founders of the Harvard website ConnectU are sitting in a compact space, engaged in a bitter legal fight. This backdrop of the film has a courtroom drama feel to it, but composed only of defendant and plaintiff and their respective lawyers. It has the jolting electricity of a very important case, but allowing much time for snippy comeback and offhand comments. These scenes compose Zuckerberg's personality brilliantly. With a pen in his hand, he is doodling in a notebook, seemingly unaware that he could potentially lose a large portion of his money to these men. Then again, the success of Facebook is behind Zuckerberg ability to give up large sums of money to ensure his empire grows. This billionaire plays his cards well, and understands the futility of a few million dollars in comparison to reduced traffic, which could be the result of user's disgust with ads. To others, the success of Facebook lies within the money that can be collected, yet Zuckerberg believes Facebook's longevity and continued dominance within the domain of social networks is more precious than any monetary deal.

David Fincher has done something with the story of Facebook that can only be described as monumental. It begins with the development of Facebook, its success, and the effect it places on the lives of the cofounders. However, Fincher succeeds at morphing the film into a product that does not overindulgently explore and scrutinize these people's lives. His film explores the idea of creative plagiarism, the unwillingness of school authorities to investigate the complaints, the Harvard School life, and the paths individuals partake to guarantee the success of their ventures. Fincher brilliantly touches on the issues, but not allowing any of these elements overwhelm the main story line. In reality, The Social Network eventually morphs in to a successful film detailing the ambition, passion, and drive of genius in general. This is what elevates the film from ordinary ""drama."" It paints a world about the development of the most famous internet social service, and turns the story on its head, establishing the wild passion that all artists have for their projects. Zuckerberg may seem aloof, but his passion for Facebook makes everything else in his life, from academic probation and loss of friendship, seem relatively unimportant or even sometimes futile.

The Social Network deserves an Oscar Nod for Best Adapted Screenplay, as Aaron Sorkin's screenplay is magnificent in the scope and depth of issues it discusses. The screenplay may seem stiff in its study of success of business ventures, but the dialogue rings true. When Sean Parker, portrayed by Justin Timberlake, advises Mark, Napster's co-founder seems to be giving viable information about the key to success. The dialogue is very sharp, funny, and theater-like in delivery, and sometimes even seems improvisational. Jesse Eisenberg deserves credit for his grand performance, but most surprising is Justin Timberlake's presence. He does not come across as a wannabe actor, such as Hillary Duff or Brittany Spears. He is great as the confident entrepreneur that we forget this is the same man who ruled the Pop World with N'Sync and ""Bring Sexy Back.""

Quite remarkably, the film offers no villain or kind soul in the film, yet Fincher paints every character with some fault. Zuckerberg, for example, is so overly ambitious that he has lost touch with his emotions-never becoming overjoyed by his success. Even Eduardo, who suffers emotional and financial loss because of Facebook, and the most likeable character, is at fault for freezing the company's bank account and possibly damaging the Facebook's reputation and stability. Mark Zuckerberg may be the eventual winner in the struggle for power, but that is because he knew his priorities and limits and stuck to them; and did not waver.

Mark Zuckerberg has claimed that this film, and the novel it was based, is more a work of fiction than fact. However true that may be, we must remember that film is supposed to be enlightening, and often entertaining. The truth may be that these men sat in their dorms writing up code day after day, but that would create a dull and unimaginative film. Film can mimic reality, but it not necessarily must do so. Zuckerberg will find an affectionate, if not realistic, portrait of himself, which shows him as the true backbone of Facebook. It may not be a flattering portrayal, but it never becomes condescending or disrespectful. This film has been compared to Citizen Kane, one of the hallmarks of Cinema. Though an unfair comparison, both films are based on fascinatingly demanding and powerful individuals who are moguls in their own ventures. Even if Facebook is forgotten in a decade, this film will still be a relevant portrayal of ambition and passion of a man who stopped at nothing to reach his goal.",1285977600,4,5964,5.074413863404689
4067760,5,B0034G4P7Q,"I thought it was certainly one of the better movies I've seen this year. Everyone and everything in that movie shone. It started out with a 5-10 minute scene (I was too busy trying to keep up to really pay attention) between Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his then girlfriend Erica that caught my attention mainly by how focused (or in certain ways unfocused) it was and the lightning speed at which the two speak.

From there the movie went everywhere and it is more dizzying than Inception was earlier this year. But that just makes it a better film, really. It's not that it takes from Inception, but rather, indeed, as many reviewers of the film have said, it plays awfully similar to Citizen Kane in terms of themes and story progression, among other things. While the movie may be set in its generation (already the film's closing line that Zuckerberg is currently the world's youngest billionaire is outdated; just a week or so ago he was said to be the second youngest via the Forbes 400) the story itself isn't. If you have seen Kane, you'll know the film is about a man involved in the newspaper industry and makes his living creating a media empire. Barely anyone in this generation reads the newspaper anymore but we know what it is still and thus the story still remains relevant. For more Kane similarities, consider that the film actually takes place after Kane has already died, the rest of the film taking place in flashbacks throughout his life. In very similar fashion, The Social Network depicts things as they happened in flashbacks told through the legal proceedings of the two ongoing lawsuits against Zuckerberg, after he has already alienated all of his closest friends.

This is not a happy movie, though it is a detached one. Even if he is the central focus of the story, it never seems focused directly on Zuckerberg himself. When someone else is on the screen, your attention is drawn away from him and you focus on them instead. Such is the brilliance of film, though, and it is the very thing that pulls you into the movie. Zuckerberg is portrayed as an --- (I'll give you a hint here: it starts with an A and ends with a HOLE), as he is called in the film, and certainly you are intended to like him less and less. But he makes the stupid mistakes that anyone might make. You trust someone with something because you know them and what they're able to do for you (in the case of Sean Parker, played surprisingly well, might I add, by Justin Timberlake) and everything turns out going completely wrong.

Whether or not there's exactly a single fact to be found in this film or not, it remains that this movie is a goldmine for those looking to get into business. The things it can teach you from showing someone else's experiences, true or false, at the same level of importance that the Godfather has a vast wealth of wisdom in it that many take to heart, despite being about organized groups engaging in criminal activity, ranging from simple fraud all the way up to murder.

Agree with me or not, The Social Network is not only a movie for the time, but it is one of the best to come out since The Dark Knight wowed everyone just over two years ago and, as with myself, anyone who I've spoken with that has seen the movie has found themselves motivated to just do SOMETHING after seeing it.

Watch this excellent Oscar contender ASAP.",1285977600,6,3377,4.556836902800659
