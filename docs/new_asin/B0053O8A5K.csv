4534140,5,B0053O8A5K,"So I am obssessed with Glee. I love everything about it, I have EVERY song they have ever sung, even Brittany's cup song. Anyways, last night was the season 3 finale and let me say, I was so mad. I thought it was the worst finale ever and I am so unimpressed. The rest of the season was really good and I loved it, just this finale ruined it for me. If you have seen seasons 1 and 2 than you won't be disappointed. Still the drama of everyone loving each other's girlfriends and boyfriends, a few twists, a lot of laughs, and amazing songs this season.",1337731200,16,552,4.168224299065421
4534141,1,B0053O8A5K,"When I finished Season 2 of Glee majorly disappointed, I came to the conclusion that perhaps maybe it wasn't Ryan Murphy's fault; Murphy has been struggling with co-writers coming and going since halfway through season one, and it seemed like the people who helped write the episodes couldn't understand Murphy's craft.

How wrong I was. Now that there's but an episode left of Glee season 3, I'll give you this much: Ryan Murphy is indeed the biggest problem with this show.

It was very telling when Murphy had both a new show and new movie in production (in other words he has a lot going on in Murphyland), and the quality of the new show (American Horror Story) was infinitely superior. It's a bad sign when I finish a TV show episode and not feel the need to tune in next week to see what happened. It's also very telling when a show has as many hiatuses as much as this did too. Major writer overhaul?

Season 3 has almost zero sense of continuity. One particularly example happens when an episode ends on a major cliffhanger (Quinn ends up in a car accident as result of texting and driving). You'd expect to see a conclusion of sorts to the episode, right? Well we get a few pointless scenes of her in a wheelchair with Artie as a mind numbingly awful plot involving Plain Blanderson and his brother unfolds.

What was the point of that episode anyways? Contrary to what the Gleeks may tell you, we had too much Blaine this season. Actually we had too much Blaine in... uhhh THE WHOLE SHOW. Singing breakup songs about his brother (Fighter, Somebody That I Used to Know) about his brother? Uhhh are they in an incestuous relationship?!

Other problems include too many new characters being brought in then disregarded. Why this Irish Kid Rory on the show? He only had a major role in his first episode and we were forced to bear his awful Irish accent (yet he IS Irish) and his frozen Botox face. Afterward he gets reduced to a few shots per episode.

in addition, song selection has been mediocre. Katy Perry? Duran Duran's weakest songs? One Direction? Seriously... WHY?!

The cast seem to be bored with this show and honestly I can't blame them either. Ah well, the cast can still earn a quick buck!",1337385600,18,2211,4.554156171284634

4534143,3,B0053O8A5K,"First off, love the show.

That said, can anyone explain why this season is:

A. Priced +$20 over the previous season

B. Priced +$5 in DVD version over the Blu-Ray version?

Complete seasons of any given TV series have a price point. This is breaking it. Yes, making the Blu-Ray cost less than the DVD ""might"" encourage more Blu-Ray purchases, but NOT if you do it by pricing the DVDs above the ""retail"" Blu-Ray price. Production is getting easier/l;ess expensive, not the other way around.

Please reconsider your retail pricing, and return to the industry standard. You're good, but you aren't THAT good.",1328227200,67,607,4.854368932038835
4534144,5,B0053O8A5K,"I am a huge fan of Glee, and I own Season 1 and 2 on DVD. I am loving Season 3 as well, there are episodes that I like more than others. So far this season my favorite episodes are Pot'O Gold, The First Time,I kissed a girl. I also enjoyed the episode where they competed in Sectionals. I can't wait for the remaining part of the season and the seniors graduation. I really enjoy the Jukeboxes they put on the DVD, that way I can watch the videos if I don't want to watch the whole episode. I am not sure if I will watch Season 4, where most of my favorite characters are graduating. But I will see. I can't wait till Season 3 comes out on DVD so I can add it to my collection.",1325030400,24,677,3.9130434782608696

4534578,5,B0053O8A5K,"Usually the 3rd season of a show is when you make it or break it, and Glee definitely made it. Even though for this season a new writing staff was hired, it still has the same Glee-ness that the past 2 seasons had.

My only problem with this season and it's not really even that much of an issue, but it seems that Brittany (who is and always will be my 2nd favorite Glee character ever), who throughout season 2 became smarter as the season progressed, it just seems that her intelligence from the end of season 2 to the beginning of season 3 went way way down. It's not too big of an issue, like I said, for it does give out some comedic relief since the lovely Heather Morris knows how to perfectly time a punchline, it just seems disappointing to see a character progress so much and then to have that all be forgotten and have her placed at the butt of the joke again.

One of my favorite things about this season was definitely the relationship between Santana and Brittany. I am one of those people that wanted to see them together even before I knew they would even come close to dating, and now that they're finally together it's so nice to see them given the same problems that the straight couples get, except for the fact that Finn/Rachel are always fighting and I really only recall 1 or 2 fights between Santana/Brittany.

The only comment I have to make about this particular DVD series, is check that it is compatible to your country. Unfortunately the one I bought wasn't compatible to where I live.  Luckily enough I had an old DVD player and it allowed most countries ratings.  However,  check the DVD recordable players, as opposed to just DVD players to see they will play certain versions.
I felt the information given when I was looking at buying this, didn't state that it would only play on a certain DVD number. If it had, I would not have bought it, knowing I wouldnt be able to watch it on my main TV.",1370563200,,638,4.389830508474576

4535521,4,B0053O8A5K,"The third return of this amazing ensemble cast unfortunately this season had it's ups and down for me more down especially when the writers completely disregarded important points mentioned in previous season and acted as if it never happened. The thing is when Glee does a good episode it does it amazing same goes for song choices. Take Mash Off that episode had some of the best songs of the seasons especially the Rumour Has It/Someone Like You mash up. For best episode came down to 2 for me Choke dealing with domestic abuse and using Shake It Out as means to show Coach Bieste abuse was powerful and then there was the suicide attempt of Dave Karofsky in On My Way which was highlighted with the song Cough Syrup and in dedication Stronger. With Glee this season for every good episode we got 2-3 not so good one but like I said the good ones keeps pulling me back to continue watching.

Still recommend for the unpopular and even the popular teen/adult whoever cause we all can learn from some of the lessons implemented in the really good episodes of the show.",1355529600,,1069,4.538860103626943

4535979,3,B0053O8A5K,"The first season of Glee was great.  It's off-key, witty humor and dialogue along with the strong story telling really made the show unique.  The show had a light tone to it, keeping the characters well-developped and making them likeable without any heavy drama (exept for Quinn's pregnancy).
In season 2, we saw the show dip a little in quality.  Season 2 had a lot of filler episodes that didn't move the plot at all like the Rocky Horror and the Britney Spears episodes.  The major problem with season 2 was that the writing was much weaker, like the writers were running out of ideas.
Now, in season three, the writing has emproved since , but now the show that was once funny and quirky is now very sentimental and overdramatic.  Glee always had sentimental moments, but season 3 is full of them.  Even though season 2 was weak, it was still funny and close to season 1.  This season feels like an after school special dealing with the ""problem of the week"".  SPOILERS AHEAD:  We deal with Kurofski trying to commit suicide, we see coach Beiste getting abused by her boyfriend and we see Quinn get into an accident from texting while driving and has to deal being in a wheel chair. And lets not forget the storyline where Ms. Cochrane and Puck have a fling and kiss in one of the earlier episodes.  Even the songs are different.  For the first 6 episodes, we don't get anything but show tunes from Broadway musicals, then, regular music comes back after.  Season 3 isn't terrible, it does have it's moments and it does some things right, but the show went into a completely different direction this year.  They didn't even include any major character development, because one of the problems other then the show being more dramatic is that it has too many characters at this point.  This was also a major problem is season 2.  We get introduced to 3 more characters, as though the 10+ glee kids aren't enough.  From the looks of the season 4 promos, the show looks like it is staying with this format.  If only they could go back to the quirky and witty Glee millions of people fell in love with back in 2009.  If they do that, then maybe it'll save this show.",1346457600,4,2166,4.4961636828644505

4536065,4,B0053O8A5K,"As season two did, Glee had it's ups and downs. But one thing that Glee did bring episode after episode was continuity, a problem that the show seemed to struggle with after season two. You might argue that not each episode had continuity and no, each episode didn't. But season three seemed to tie the show together. After the mess of season two, which had certain characters being spotlighted week after week and had no continuity whatsoever (or only when it was convenient to Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan), season three will delight and surprise fans in that matter. Glee is picked up where season two should have been, explaining all fans wanted to know about Puck and Quinn. Where their relationship stands and their child. We see both a vulnerable side of Puck and Quinn, who were barely featured in season two even as regulars. We also find out more about another neglected character, Tina. Tina has been featured for a good portion of season one and only at the beginning of season two. But it isn't until the fun episode ""Props/Nationals"" that we find out how neglected she feels. The writers even joke about their lack of continuation of her character in the ""What Did You Miss/Catch Up"" portion of Glee, before the episode airs. Her episode is fun and witty, almost making you forgive the writers for neglecting such a fantastic character as Tina and gives Jenna Ushkowitz, who plays Tina, a chance to shine. Another pro about season three is the incorporation of the parents. While we have met Finn, Kurt, and Quinn's parents in season one and two, we now find out about some of the other parents of the members of New Directions. Throughout the season we are introduced to Rachel, Santana, Sam, and Mike's parents as well as Blaine's brother. Each set of parents bring a new element to the storyline, which makes for an interesting plot. While these are all pros, there are some cons that come with season three (as all shows do have cons. First, the excessive amount of tribute episodes. While I did love some of the tribute episode Glee has aired, I found there to be too many tribute episodes this season. Against Ryan Murphy's own statement of how their would be no tribute episodes, their ended up being at least four tribute episodes this season. Some of the tribute episodes were ridiculous and seemed like an excuse for writers block while others were emotional and important to the overall theme of the show, such as the Whitney Houston tribute. Another flaw this season had? The incoporation of The Glee Project winners and runners-up. The timing of when the characters should be included all seemed out of place and awkward. For instance, Joe Hart, played by Samuel Larsen (TGP runner-up), came in right at the end and his character seemed forced in because of their requirements to include him in and out of place to be in the finale of the show. But for what it's worth, the  characters were an interesting addition to the show and possibly foreshadowed a future Glee club. Like season two, season three of Glee had it's ups and downs. Their were memorable and unmemorable moments but it's a season worth treasuring.",1345075200,6,3155,4.725952813067151

4536067,3,B0053O8A5K,"Lauren Hoffman recently wrote a perfectly critical review on Vulture.com of the season three finale of Glee which, let's face it, is the final episode for most of us. Despite promises of most of the cast's return, we know that the focus will be on the juniors who are left over from this year. Students like Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie (Kevin McHale) will, more likely than not, see the show through to its actual end, coupled with the winners of the second season of The Glee Project. The appearances of cast members that everyone will be awaiting will be spread out thinly across the fourth season in brief cameos. The result is that we will never know when they will pop up, and that gimmick will keep us watching every week, same as I did with Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff).

I disagree with Hoffman on the season finale that it was unforgivable to see such a poignant tune (""Forever Young"") delivered by Mr. Schu (Matthew Morrison) so early in the show. I thought that was plenty appropriate, however I felt the complete lack of his presence elsewhere throughout the episode was even more unsettling. Yet Glee suffers from the addition of so many characters that to give them all a proper send-off would probably require a two-hour episode, something they could have easily done had they not already used that up the previous week with the ""Props""/""Nationals"" episodes.

Not to skip ahead, but what I did find unforgivable was that the end of the episode focused entirely on Rachel's journey after high school, assuming that she is everyone's favorite and that we all want to know where she ends up. While I found Lea Michele's performance to be breathtaking when Finn delivers the news, and her immediately following rendition of ""Roots Before Branches"" to be soul-crushing, many of us effectively despise Rachel. Her character was cutthroat and annoying, and we don't care what happens to her.

Not like what happens to Rachel is any surprise. She will become a washed-up theater star who abandons her dream of a successful career on Broadway in favor of raising her unplanned children or succumbing to a life of substance abuse. Whether she is to someday live out this unfulfilling existence with Finn (Cory Monteith) or not is of no moment. And since Monteith and Michele are dating in real life, it's not difficult for the ""Finchel"" lovers out there to imagine the couple's rekindling in the future.

One thing Glee does rather well is its montages set to music, and I think we all would have benefitted more from seeing each of our favorite characters in a two-second glimpse into each of their futures. Kurt (Chris Colfer) got rejected from his life-long dream of going to NYADA as well. What happens to him? Kurt is a fan favorite, too. Shouldn't his fans' desires be sated as well?

Why can't we see Mercedes (Amber Riley) fly off to Hollywood with Sam (Chord Overstreet), or Santana (Naya Rivera) possibly getting engaged to Brittany (Heather Morris)? Speaking of engagements, what about Emma (Jayma Mays) and Will's wedding? Ah, but that will probably be the tie-in to the fourth season as an excuse to bring back the entire cast for one last ensemble appearance.

It was certainly enjoyable that there was the callback to the first episode with the ""Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat"" scene, but in an episode that begged for as many callbacks as possible, I think we could have used as much nostalgia as possible. Clip shows are not original but they are effective, especially when this episode is essentially our last rodeo. We quite possibly will never see this full cast together again. Shouldn't we have been given the memories over which we could have properly grieved?

I agree with Hoffman that Gloria Estefan was a stunt cast, as her presence was not entirely useful, although I disagree that her advice was so profound as to be necessary to the plot development. We could have learned of Santana's impending future without the celebrity reinforcement. I also agree with Hoffman that we get our first real shock at who is left in the cast when the seniors perform the New Radicals' one-hit wonder ""You Get What You Give"" to the juniors, and she brings up the excellent point that Sam is left behind. She asks how it was then legally possible for him to have been a male stripper in the ""On My Way"" episode. Continuity is more important in some instances than others. This instance was one. Hopefully, Puck (Mark Salling) was still 18 when he made out with Shelby (Idina Menzel) and nothing ever skews that logic.

It was odd that in an episode that could have been emotionally jarring on so many levels, one of the best goodbyes was between Sue (Jane Lynch) and Quinn (Dianna Agron). Who would have seen that coming? Even the goodbye between Mr. Schu and Finn was lukewarm. On the parental front, we were able to squeeze in some face time with Finn's mom (Romy Rosemont) and Kurt's dad (Mike O'Malley) for good measure, despite the complete absence of Rachel's ""two gay dads"" at her graduation (Jeff Goldblum and Brian Stokes Mitchell). Her dads were discussed in more scenes than any other parent during the show's run. I guess the final budget was too low to bring them back.

Another point on which to agree with Hoffman is her last. I didn't care about the characters or the plot nearly as much as I did the music, which essentially negates most of what I wrote above. However, I kept watching because knowing the backstory, no matter how thinly stretched to match the granted song list of the week (""The Rain in Spain"" in the episode ""Choke"" was painful), added a depth to the music that would not necessarily be brought out during a performance alone. That being said, this cast is the one we have followed all along, the one we knew would eventually win Nationals. I predicted how Sectionals, Regionals and Nationals would be won since season one and was not surprisingly on target every time.

Now that they have won and graduated, the fire has gone out. There's nothing left to root for, except maybe Kurt and Blaine's (Darren Criss) relationship. And despite my adoration for Tina, Blaine, Rory (Damian McGinty) and the other juniors who are in for a lackluster senior year at McKinley High, if the next season finale is anything like the last, I have little or no desire to tune in again next year.",1344902400,10,6343,4.721770551038844

Season Three was a complete failure. Me and fellow glee fan (my vocal coach) really hated it. He quit watching during season 3. I stuck with it even though it trainrecked. In this case, there was only a small handful of episodes that were decent. It was slow, less music, had a terrible plot, bad song selections, was trashy really, and overall almost unbearable. I did not buy this DVD for the first time. It isn't even worth 30 dollars in my opinion and that means a lot as such an earnest glee fan. I have bought all of the albums and many more singles of each season.

4536070,2,B0053O8A5K,"Let's start off by saying I am a HUGE Glee fan, and even flew out of state for their Glee Live Concert in 2011. I think that says something about how much I used to love this show.

However, this season was all sorts of disappointments. This show was so fun and fresh during their first two seasons, but all that faded away very quickly this past season.

There is absolutely no character development throughout this season. Even for Quinn, who has had the biggest character arc on the show a part from Kurt. They start her off in a state of being a ""rocker"" and upset at the world by getting a Ryan Seacrest tattoo, dying her hair pink, having a nose ring, etc. Things that make NO SENSE.

Of course the writers focus on Rachel and Finn's story-line the most (the worst part about the show). Everyone seemed to root for Rachel Berry the past 2 seasons, and wanted her to succeed. Instead, we lose the Rachel Berry we all knew to someone who hides behind her wedding with Finn and is willing to throw away her dreams because she is afraid no one will love her. We don't see the ambitious and sometimes kooky Rachel everyone fell in love with.

What upsets me the most is how this season was the time for the characters who were graduating to shine, considering most won't be back, and if they are, it would be a small part in later seasons.

The finale was suppose to be emotional and wrap up everyone's story-line but it did the opposite. Mercedes got about 10 seconds worth of footage simply stating she got a record contract, Mike got nothing, Puck the same, etc. It was just a mess. Of course Rachel and Finn get an hour of bouncing back and forth each other about their wedding and THEIR future. Which upsets me because that was suppose to be an emotional episode and in the end, all the fans were upset and disappointed it only focused on 2 characters.

Plain and simple, this season was poorly written.

I have no idea how season 4 is going to survive unless they get new writers. Instead of the show ""The Glee Project"" looking for new cast members, they should get one for new writers. As it is, they only focused on 6/14 characters. Until they find out how to successfully write for all the characters, they shouldn't be bringing new characters into the show for season 4.

I know it's very hard to film and work on a show like this but instead of the writers thinking of clever things for Brittney to say, they should put all their energy into the script.",1344211200,9,2465,4.378555798687089

1st point: character development.
Sloppy and incomplete, no matter which character.
Contrary to what some fans believe, yes, there is such a thing as too much Blaine. They didn't even develop Kurt and Blaine's relationship, they just kept featuring Blaine in songs over and over again.
Kurt, however, was not sufficiently developed, not nearly enough. I won't spoil the finale, but his own story ends with a letter that will influence his academic future, and yet we never find out how he will handle the news. Don't get me started on the NYADA decisions which I still don't understand.
I also think that about 98% of the Glee fandom will agree with my next statement: too much Finchel.
Rachel and Finn have always been major characters, since season 1, but their relationship has gotten so annoying and cringe-worthy that it's exhausting. Finn's wedding proposal ruined the ""Yes/No"" episode, because it appears as if he's only resorting to this because he feels useless and irrelevant in other parts of his life. Don't even get me started on the moment when he said out loud that he had nothing positive going on for him in his life while Rachel was sitting right next to him. Major jackass moment. I felt sorry for Rachel on several occasions throughout this season.
As for Rory, well... Glee has got to stop adding new characters just to make the actors or the audience happy if they're not going to make them remotely relevant.
Last but not least... I was disappointed to see that the season 3 finale ended with only Rachel, instead of a group number. It sends the message that this show is not about the New Directions, but about this one character - which is not what the show was about at the start.

2nd point: plot continuity
Absolutely appalling.
Quinn's accident - episode 14 ended with such a major cliffhanger and we waited for 7 weeks to find out what had happened to her. What do we get? A BLAINE ANDERSON episode.
Now, don't get me wrong, I love Darren Criss. I loved him in A Very Potter Musical/Sequel (I'm also a huge Potterhead) and I think he's a remarkably interesting and lovable person in real life. But there's a difference between developing his character and over-displaying him while disregarding more important plot events.
Also, there's a screenshot going around the internet that shows Artie literally standing up during another character's performance. It probably happened too fast for me to notice it during the concerned episode, and I will have to re-watch it to be sure that it really occurred, but this was a major fail.

3rd point: song selection.
Now, don't get wrong, we had the pleasure of witnessing some wonderful performances this season. The Troubletones mash-ups (gold star to Rumor Has It/Someone Like You), Will's wedding proposal to Emma, and a few others made me very happy.
However, there were also some terrible choices.
(Side note: I literally cringed and yelled ""No!"" when they performed the One Direction song. But I reacted the same way when they covered Justin Bieber and Rebecca Black in Season 2.)
I was really excited when I heard that they were doing a Michael Jackson tribute episode, but the performances disappointed me to a great extent. I loved their rendition of Thriller in season 2 because it was fresh and original, but the songs in ""Michael"" were just poor covers. I actually fast-forwarded through a few songs because I was relentlessly bored.

You can't imagine how much I wanted to love this season. I really did. But if we have to go through 2 bad episodes before every good episode, it's no longer worth watching.
I will watch season 4, because I still have hope for this show, but I am genuinely scared that Ryan Murphy and the other producers will make the same mistakes.

I miss the old Glee! :'(",1340150400,21,4093,4.663434903047092
4536173,4,B0053O8A5K,"I used to think this show was such an inspiration to youth but now it just seems like a bad after school special. Don't get me wrong season three of this very quirky show is very enjoyable, and this is someone who could not give two craps about ships. I personally could care less for any of the relationships on the show and I find it quite pathetic that people are giving this a one star because of a cut scene. Cry me a river, this show has so many cut scenes in general everyone should just be aware of that. You're definitely not the only ones that have stuff cut.

While this season does have its low points: I Kissed a Girl's quite offensive coming out storyline for Santana as well as On My Way's really brutal yet honest take on teenage suicides. I understand why shows may want to dive into these kind of issues but this is Glee. This should not be done in what is marketed as a comedy first and foremost.

Now on to the great stuff. Rachel Berry is as fierce as ever this season and while the marriage plot with Finn was stupid and a low point of the season the mature decision they made in the finale was really telling of Rachel as an individual character as well as Finn. I loved the entire episode of Yes/No, I thought Will's proposal to Emma was probably one of the most creative and memorable proposals in TV History but the moment was ruined by Finn's very rash proposal to Rachel.

Kurt is great as a character alone and his boyfriend Blaine is good as well, though I find the couple very boring. They barely have any drama and if they do its just wrapped up by the end of the episode. Blaine I feel is just a doormat.

I enjoyed the usage of the rest of the characters. Standouts this season were as always Jane Lynch as Sue Sylvester, Lea Michele, Naya Rivera, Jayma Mays whom made me cry twice and Cory Monteith.

This season had lots of feelgood moments, from New Directions finally taking Nationals, Will and Emma finally having sex after three seasons as well as Finn and Rachel, Rachel's spectacular solo at Nationals as well as more memorable moments, collimating in the Graduation episode.

I am very much looking forward to season four of Glee and where all the characters go from even though I know that most characters aside from the ones in Lima and Rachel/Kurt/Santana/Finn will be guest stars.

This season is not better than season one, because season one is gold for the most part. However, it definitely has brought Glee up a notch from the abysmal season two.

Overall the season is a 4 out of 5.",1339804800,8,2534,4.376595744680851
4536174,1,B0053O8A5K,"I am a huge fan of Glee. I own the first two seasons and watched season 3 wanting to like it.
I didn't. In fact, one of the episodes, 'On My Way' is so offensive (doesn't even come with a warning for suicide, even though The First Time had a T rating because two male characters kissed) that I rage when people talk about it being such an enlightening episode. I'm sorry, but as great as an actor Max Adler is, his character is not deserving of my sympathy. Especially when it's being used as a cheap device for more viewers, there is nothing I hate more than using SUICIDE as a marketing ploy.

Not to mention the careless way they handled the near death of a regular, and then in the next episode, she's fine and everything is okay, she's just in a wheelchair for a few episodes and goes back to her plotting ways. (because on Glee if you're a girl and not Rachel you are a scheming witch who just needs a guy to show you the right way.)

This show is often praised on the way it handles it's gay and lesbian characters, I would say that they did this well in season 1 and most with season 2, however season 3 is a different story. Season 3 saw Kurt lose a student election to Brittany, who later forgot she even won, have to face the awful Sebastian (the Warbler story line this year was completely unnecessary and just threw everything that was Dalton in Season 2 down the drain), and then not get into the school of his dreams even though he aced his audition. Kurt this year was more of Rachel's gay accessory than an actual character, unfortunate because Chris Colfer is amazing in every scene he's in, a GOLDEN GLOBE actor, and yet, he is off in the sidelines. I would also like to point out that in the episodes Kurt, and his boyfriend Blaine (played by Darren Criss) were in (DwS, TFT) they nail every scene and you can so easily tell they are in love with each other.

Probably why they cut out their Christmas scene of exchanging presents, (a scene that was shown in promotional pictures but cut from the episode because it ran too long, or so the homophobics say at Fox.) because to see Blaine and Kurt's honest and so real relationship and then to see the disaster that is Rachel and Finn, you'd wonder why this show picks to focus on Finchel.

Coincidentally, that Christmas scene was promised to be on this season 3 boxset, but we all know how much Glee hates their fans, and so we obviously see that it is not listed. I will not be spending my money to please the people at Fox that thinks this is the right way to write a show. Especially at an extra $20.

And really, no one gives two cents about Will & Emma, or Sue. These special features are more of a kick in the face than anything else. I'd much rather see deleted scenes, bloopers, the Behind the scenes specials they put on the internet, or anything dealing with the choreography with Zach Woodlee.

So don't waste your money. Buy the 3 semi-decent episodes off itunes or amazon and be done with this. I only hope they get canceled before they make a worse episode than OMW.",1339200000,28,3050,4.31413612565445
4536175,1,B0053O8A5K,"I have just cancelled my pre-order of Glee S3 on hearing that the infamous Klaine Box Scene, cut from the show but promised in the box set is not, after all, to be included. The marginalisation of the gay couples, most notably Kurt and Blaine in S3 has been appalling, as signified by the loss of this scene. I can't believe that I was prepared to shell out good money just for the chance at seeing SOME semblance of intimacy from this iconic couple. Alas, no, once again, I am to be disappointed.  No Klaine, just endless boring Finchel arguing about pointless pigs.

So, congratulations, Fox. I'm done with you, and done with your show.",1339027200,23,638,4.539130434782609
8455366,5,B0053O8A5K,"Life isn't going that well for me in 2018, looking for something to binge-watch, I finally pulled my previously-purchased ""Glee"" off the shelf.  If there are defects, it's too late to return them!  I am relating to this show even though I have little of the cast's talent.  Half of my friends don't ""get"" musicals.  At least they don't throw frozen drinks in my face.  Is it too soon for nostalgia about this show?  One day the surviving cast will enjoy a huge revival...I've been looking them up on IMDB to see how they're doing a few years later.  Most seem to be active.

For under ten bucks, there is a huge amount of entertainment in this set.  The veteran kids all come back, joined by this adorable Irish kid named  Rory.  Also, watch for the first appearances by future ""Flash"" Grant Gustin.  The writing remains sharp, the relationships between the characters deepen...a bit...I am drawn into them a bit too much for my age.

What got me to writing is a scene in which Finn's mom and stepfather, along with Will and Emma, confront Finn (Cory Monteith) about his considering enlisting in the military like his late father.  Finn's mom reveals that his dad didn't actually die in service, but came home from Iraq dishonorably discharged with a drug problem and eventually overdosed.  How can anyone watch that now and not be torn by the agony of hindsight?  I'm trying to appreciate the joy of this show and not let the tragedies (which I hope are going to be limited to two) overshadow it.

That same episode has Becky (with a hilarious English voiceover accent) going after Artie, and Will's spectacular proposal to Emma.  Well done.

I'm not going to be more specific about Cory Monteith, or Mark Walling, in case young people read this.  I shouldn't type so soon after sobbing.  I wish the best to everyone involved with this show.  It was unique, and it had to take heart to do this show; the magic can't be repeated.",1526774400,,1929,4.595307917888563
