2636352,5,B000HEWEIU,"Got these movies for our six year old daughter.  All three are nice, wholesome movies that all the girls who visit our home love.  We have watched them over and over for the past 2 years and watch one of them at least once a month.  The whole history based concept of the books and movies from American Girl has given our daughter an education that the school won't give her until middle school.  Definitely recommend these!",1323216000,,424,4.467532467532467
2636353,5,B000HEWEIU,"Felicity is played by the same actress who was in The Secret Life of The American Teenager on ABC family.  Her best friend, Elizabeth Cole is always by her side whenever she is learning to make tea at school.

During the movie, terrible things happen in Felicity's life.  A cruel trainer mistreats a horse called Penny, her mother gets sick after giving birth to a new baby even though she survives, Ben is injured and lost, and her grandfather dies.

The movie is based on a series of Felicity books by an author named Valerie Tripp.",1291420800,,534,4.53125
2636364,5,B000HEWEIU,We love american girl.  We have seen these movies on TV and have read the books too.  They teach about life lessons for young girls in such an easy way.  It is a great example for these young girls today. THey are wonderful stories and my 7 yr old daughter loves it.  This is the perfect Christmas gift for her.  She will be so excited and I expect we will watch these movies over and over again.,1289001600,,396,4.090909090909091
2636365,5,B000HEWEIU,My daughter owned an American girl doll since she was six. She is now eight and this was a perfect time for her to watch.  Great role models for young girls. I'm so happy we've kept her young and withstood the introduction of Hannah Montana.  This is the way to go to preserve their innocence while giving them snippets of this country's history.,1275868800,,346,4.476190476190476
2636366,5,B000HEWEIU,"My DD, 8, loves these movies.  They are nice stories that teach a bit about history at the same time as teaching some good morals. A great change from some of the stuff that's on TV these days.",1270080000,,193,4.078947368421052
2636367,5,B000HEWEIU,"I had read reviews prior to purchasing these movies for my daughter. I was very pleased and quite surprised by the quality of these movies.  Not only did each movie have a valuable lesson to teach, they each displayed a huge array of appropriate behaviors that seem to be lost on our generation.  It is refreshing to see children displaying good manners, respect for adults (including their parents), and an understanding of the blessings they have in their life.  So many children these days have an entitlement attitude, lack respect and manners, and talk to adults in sassy tones.  Surprisingly, my daughter picks up quite a bit of sass from the Disney Channel and other kid shows.  I appreciate the American Girl movies displaying the alternative.  Parents can talk until they are blue in the face about how they would like their children to behave. Having children view this behavior from other children is so much more powerful.  I must also say that these movies were entertaining and I enjoyed watching them with my girls.",1265328000,,1030,4.851428571428571
2636368,4,B000HEWEIU,"These movies while very simplistic share pertinent real information about history.  They teach lessons on being honest, being yourself and doing the right thing.  This is a far cry from the Disney genre.  Definitely more wholesome - but welcomed for my 9 year old.  It turns her American doll into a real person.  These are also great to use if your children have any sort of assignment on historical fiction.  These remind me of my youth watching Little House.  Give them a try - even if you don't have the expensive dolls!",1264982400,,524,4.630434782608695
2636369,5,B000HEWEIU,"This is a great deal.  I highly recommend this to all parents of kids of all ages.  We began watching the American Girl movies when my daughter was 3.  She's now 5 and we continue to love them.  Best of all, it's not just my daughter that loves them - her dad and I do too!!!  These have all have a nice plot and give a child a sense of seeing history come to life in such a fun and educational way.

The movies do all deviate slightly from the plots in the books, however, my daughter doesn't seem to mind.  All of the girls are wonderful girls that you'd love for your daughter to be like.  The story of Felicity (set during the Revolutionary War) befriending the evil Jiggy Nye and dealing with a strained friendship with her best friend Elizabeth since one was a patriot and the other was a loyalist.  The Samantha movie is a story of her becoming best friends with Nellie (set in 1904 - when automobiles were starting to be popular and they things like women voting were the hot topics) and her dealing with learning to be a ""proper"" lady like her grandmother. The Molly movie (set during the World War II) is of her accepting her changed life with her dad off to war and new friend Emily who was sent from England to escape some of the fighting.

I was never a person that cared about history.  I had one history class in high school that I didn't learn anything from.  I also had one history class in college that I learned some things, but that knowledge didn't stick with me.  I just can't believe how much I've learned from these movies (and books!).

I highly recommend all of the Historical American Girl movies and books to everyone.  I am really disappointed that American Girl has gone to making so many more of the ""Just like Me"" dolls instead of continuing to educate our children on such important historical events.",1262822400,,1834,4.368731563421829
2636370,5,B000HEWEIU,"We have 3 young daughters (adopted)and we have watched all the American Girl movies.  One might think that they would be all ""fluff"", but they are in fact full of substance, and each deal with a real world subject, not just of the period of the movie, but present day.  Samantha hit our girls because of the 3 little girls that Samantha helps find a new home.  It presents a positive role model to a young woman of today even though it was set in 1904.  I highly recommend it, in fact, it would be good for little boys to watch too.",1257552000,,532,4.186274509803922

2636388,5,B000HEWEIU,All three of these movies are well made and based on the American Girl books of the same titles.

These wonderful stories based on the American Girl doll series come to life in these three wonderful movies. I'd recommend them for girls ages 6 on up! I'm over 50 and I loved them all!
They are made with great attention to the details of the era, from costumes, hair styles to home decor. You really feel like you've stepped back in time. Plus, they are a wonderful way to make history come alive for kids. They are so entertaining, I've watched them over and over with my own family!

The cinematography is excellent, production values are high, acting is solid.  The period sets and costumes are well done.  And the stories are great - realistic plots and drama.  In short, these films represent what is possible in family / kids movies, and what I would like to see more of as an alternative and antidote to the usual Hollywood blockbuster spectacles.  Highly recommended, especially to independent and active girls who need strong role models, but also to intelligent boys and adults who like good stories.

I think young girls should use there imagination about these things instead of seeing it on TV. Also, the coolest part of American Girl is the books, kids will sstop reading them and just say "" I'll just watch the movie"" We really should encourage them to read and not watch! This ruins all of American Girl and please lets savor the old fashion charm.",1203120000,,514,4.421052631578948

Its her favorite now and she watches it over and over. Samantha is also very good and reminds me a bit of Shirley Temples The Littlest Princess. These movies are great because they are clean/decent you don't have to worry about anything bad or language etc and they are done beautifuly.

2636454,5,B000HEWEIU,"These movies are great, wholesome movies for the whole family. The American Girls portrayed in them are good role models for young girls, and the circumstances they find themselves in are fun, and sometimes challenging. While they don't follow the books exactly, the characters' personalities are true to print. You will be sure to find your girls 'playing Samantha' or one of the other characters. Get a big bowl of popcorn and settle in for a great night of fun!!",1190160000,,465,4.825
2636455,5,B000HEWEIU,"We bought these movies as a gift for our neice and goddaughter, and then kept one for ourselves.  Our entire family enjoyed watching these wholesome, moralistic movies with great acting and well known actors.  The American Girl products are very popular with girls, and it eases my mind as a parent to know that these items have some ""substance"" behind them.",1188950400,,358,4.852459016393443
2636456,5,B000HEWEIU,"This collection is a wonderful way for children to learn about the life of children from different time periods.  I found the stories delightful, informative, and historically correct.  Personally I enjoyed Samantha most, but I don't want to short change the others.  Hopefully the other stories from The American Girl series will also be made into movies.  As a teacher, I would encourage parents to make these movies a must for their child to see, boys as well as girls.  This is great family entertainment.",1185753600,,509,4.9411764705882355
2636457,5,B000HEWEIU,"Each of these movies is excellent! All based upon the books from the American Girl collection, they are beautifully written and directed . . . very poignant  . . . a great way for young girls 7+ to learn about historical time periods through the eyes of girls near their own age.

2636459,5,B000HEWEIU,Through all my years of collecting American Girl Dolls it feels great to have them come to life on screen. Sitting with your doll and watching the movie feels real ith your doll. it makes all troubles go down for the time they are on. If a girl is an American Girl Doll collector they will never get tired of their doll coming to life beyond there eyes.,1174694400,,353,4.205882352941177

2636461,4,B000HEWEIU,"My daughter absolutely loves all things American Girl.  These movies are well done- good production value, known actors etc.  The one thing I will say is that each of them has some parts that are sad and suspenseful, and some of my daughter's more sensitive friends were upset by them.  They all have happy endings, but if your child is easily upset or saddened I'd preview before you let them watch.",1173484800,,400,4.605633802816901
2636462,5,B000HEWEIU,I loved the 'An American Girl' trilogy movies.  After watching these movies over the holidays I realized that this would be a great set to have as a young girl.  I purchased all three DVDs for my niece.  Very sweet and positive stories.,1172534400,,236,4.441860465116279
2636463,5,B000HEWEIU,These are all very well done and are uplifting and heartwarming. I could recommend them to anyone.  They have a wonderful story of the human spirit and what mankind was meant to be.  No bad language or sexual content.

2636466,4,B000HEWEIU,"i enjoyed this collection. all three help to bring history alive. i  felt that the acting in Samantha-An American Girl Holiday was of a higher standard. AnnaSofia Robb as'Samantha' was outstanding. in Felicity-An American Girl Adventure ,i found Felicity's father to be overly righteous. i didn't find the storyline very interesting in Molly-An American Girl on the Home Front but the historical aspect was effective.",1169078400,,417,5.415384615384616

2636471,5,B000HEWEIU,"My two daughters, ages 4 and 6, as well as my 8 year old son and I all loved Molly - An American Girl on the Home Front and Samantha - An American Girl Holiday...(although my tough little future military fighter pilot son probably wouldn't admit it to anyone besides our family!) I did not see the Felicity movie, but the kids were not as thrilled with that one as they were with the others.  All in all, these movies are really great...good clean entertainment with good life lessons to learn.  I would definitely recommend them.",1168473600,,530,4.510416666666667
2636472,5,B000HEWEIU,"My granddaughters and I have thoroughly enjoyed two of the three movies. The DVD set arrived promptly and in great shape--truly ""like new.""

What a great way to give girls a glimpse into the lives of those who lived in earlier times--and to encourage their own thoughts about what it meant to grow up in Colonial America (learning to serve tea instead of playing soccer or being student council president) or in the U.S. or Britain during WWII.",1168473600,,444,4.6923076923076925
2636473,5,B000HEWEIU,"My 8 year old daughter just loves the American Girl products. After checking into other retailers, including the American Girl website, I found this item here at Amazon at a remakable price. In fact, I also ordered an American Girl Bookset and an Art Studio Set at a great price. I was able to take advatage of the ""free shipping"" offer and was delighted with the items and the quick delivery. I am now checking out Amazon for other American Girl products since my daughters birthday is just a month away. I would highly recommend the movie collection and Amazon.",1168473600,,563,4.64

8139201,5,B000HEWEIU,"You can't go wrong with this set because all three of these films are absolutely wonderful: acting, script, staging, photography. However, my suggestion would be to pay under $14 for the four-disc box that includes all of these movies, plus ""Kit Kittredge."" Not that I recommend ""Kit"" very highly - - it is much inferior to these three gems - - but the price reduction makes the choice a no-brainer. Enjoy ""Felicity,"" ""Samantha,"" and ""Molly"" over and over again, and be impressed by how superb such wholesome, inspiring films can be when in the hands of producers who really care.",1401062400,,580,4.81
