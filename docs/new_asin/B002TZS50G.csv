3986778,5,B002TZS50G,"This is a great documentary about Ian and the lads. Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, John Evan and others offer their opinions on their turns in the band. Hesitate no longer. Do your self a favor and buy this. Now. Not later.",1375574400,4,217,4.589743589743589
3986779,5,B002TZS50G,I thought the interviews were great and the content held my attention from start to finish. I feel it told me things I did not know about the band plus there was some footage I had not seem before.,1363478400,,197,4.076923076923077

3986781,5,B002TZS50G,Ordered this for my husband who is a Jethro Tull fanatic.  He loved hearing the stories of various past members.  It was honest and enlightning.,1358035200,,144,4.72
3986782,4,B002TZS50G,"Had it contained more uninterrupted performances and more older quality footage it would have hit a grand slam especially if they found more ""Passion Play"" footage. I believe I saw in this DVD about 5 seconds of what might have been a ""Passion Play"" performance. Understand, in 1973 no other album and tour was hotter than this one, in fact it set new concert records for selling out major arenas across the United States. With this historic moment in time, it seems, nobody had the eyesight, insight and foresight to capture one full performance on quality audio/video equipment. What's a Tull fan to do? This DVD does tell details of the bands history and past band members through very good interviews. This makes the DVD well worth it!",1353196800,4,739,4.78125
3986783,5,B002TZS50G,IF YOU ARE A HARD-CORE TULL FAN THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS DVD.  IF YOU ARENT THEN YOU WON'T. THIS IS MY 5TH TULL DVD AND THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY BEST.,1305504000,6,148,3.484848484848485
3986784,4,B002TZS50G,"Enjoying this very much. Only disappointment is that there wasn't more of it. Some of their best albums are hardly even mentioned.
A very nice addition to your Tull collection and for anyone interested in progressive rock.",1284681600,8,222,5.027027027027027
3986785,3,B002TZS50G,"Even though I enjoyed some of the anecdotes and testimonies of the various members and ex-members of Jethro Tull regarding their experiences on the road, it seems to me that MUSIC is the great absent from this documentary. There is no real discussion of Jethro Tull's music -of the way it progressed, or rather changed, from one album to another- and of the influence of the rest of the band in Ian Anderson's songs. There is some old gossip (Cornick departure, the APP era retirement, the ""revamped"" Jethro Tull of 1980)and little surprises.
 Oh, and there is a moment when Dee Palmer brings out, without any valid justification, some soporific comments about the presence of ""scatological humour"" in some of the Great Geniuses of Mankind: from Mozart to... Ian Anderson!!!  Did she had in mind the ""warm fart at XMAS"" from ""Bad Eyed and Loveless""? C'mon, give us a break!!!",1276473600,4,875,4.826666666666667
3986786,5,B002TZS50G,"Mind you, this is not a stem to stern overview of Tull's recording history. One might think they went from ""Too Old to Rock and Roll"" to ""A,"" which, needless to say, overlooks some fine albums. Rather, this release gives virtually everyone affiliated with Jethro Tull a part in telling the group's story. They are, as you know or would expect, intelligent and articulate people. John Evan's wry humor is delightful; Dee Palmer's insights are expert and engaging. If this group has been vital to you, as it has been to me, then you'll relish the opportunity to sit down with Mick Abrahams, Martin Barre, Clive Bunker, Glen Cornick, Barriemore Barlow, Dave Pegg, Peter Vetesse, and others involved with the performance and promotion of Jethro Tull. Honestly, I'm moved by the film's closing sequence, when each is given a chance to remark summarily about the group's legacy. I think it's Peter Vetesse who mentions Ian Anderson's sense of 'duty'--a concept not commonly associated with the entertainment industry these days. One reservation, though: since this product obviously isn't intended for the casual fan, it could have been extended in length and substance to become the definitive Tull documentary. It is not, but it's awfully good.",1267833600,36,1240,5.083333333333333
3986787,5,B002TZS50G,"Great Documentary on Jethro Tull that is a must for all Tull fans.  All the materials add up to a bit, but the main documentary is about 1 hr. and 50 minutes, definitely the longest thing I've seen on Tull.  This was actually done on their 40th Anniversary in 2008 and has been in release in England since then.  Don't know why it took so long to officially release it here in the USA.

Jethro Tull definitely deserves a real, in-depth look at.  This, as I said before, so far comes closest.  Hard core fans will be disappointed that about half the documentary covers their first 5 years and they spend about a half an hour on the next 35 years.  The summary in the end is excellent and best of all, all the former band members get plenty of screen time (in fact, Ian Anderson isn't really properly recognized as the true core until near the end - Dee (David) Palmer sums it up quite nicely saying how there was really no stopping Ian from being successful regardless of whoever he would end up in a band with.  His determination, drive and focus are really why we ever had Jethro Tull.

As far as the music, it doesn't disappoint with lots of pieces getting their moment or two in the spotlight and in many ways the lack of the Songs from the Wood/Heavy Horses days on this is made up for with the MSG dvd that was released a few months back.  In some ways that dvd along with this one and the Isle of Wight concert give us a good overview of Tull's glory days (1968-1979) and certainly my favorite period.  I still wish we had a concert or two from the Aqualung or Thick as a Brick tours, but unfortunately they don't seem to exist (and it is my very personal suspicion that Mr. Jeffrey Hammond is the reason there is virtually no Tull footage from 1971-75 - Has anyone noticed that all Tull film ceases in this period and picks up again with the Tampa concert in 76?).  That being said Mr. Hammond is the only band member missing from this dvd, but he was generous enough to contribute a wonderful essay that is very amusing.

All Tull fans will want to see this.  It was really great to see Clive Bunker, Mick Abrahams, John Evan, Barry Barlow and especially Glen Cornick, who gets to give his whole side of the story on his mysterious departure from the band.  I give this an 'A', but I would love to see a 4 hour documentary on Tull one day, like the one that was just done for Monty Python.",1263600000,82,2397,4.272123893805309

8380833,5,B002TZS50G,This is the best option for a video history of a great band.  Interviews of the band members were a kick and enlightening.,1518912000,,122,4.304347826086956
8380834,5,B002TZS50G,Excellent film with good coverage of Tull's history with interviews with all players and promoters. I have followed Tull since the early 70's and they were/are my favorite band. Or visa versa.,1501891200,,192,5.03125
8380835,5,B002TZS50G,"Great item for the serious Jethro Tull fan. 2008 BBC documentary with candid ""warts and all"" interviews with Ian as well as ex-members who give some behind the scene dirt. Additionally, there is a fabulous 1969 black and white documentary that includes performances, interview with Ian's parents, and going about business on tour. Must have for true Tull fans!",1498435200,,360,5.11864406779661

8380840,5,B002TZS50G,"This isn't for everyone, but diehard Tull fans, especially those of the classic years will appreciate it greatly. I have to add, though, that the production values aren't fantastic. Other classic groups have been the subject of better documentaries. (I'm focusing more on edit and production qualities in that comment, not on content which is fine.) I give it 5 stars because it's the best I know of for what's out there about Tull. But as good as it is, frankly Tull and Ian Anderson especially deserves a bit better.",1438992000,,518,4.766666666666667
