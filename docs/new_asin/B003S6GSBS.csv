8404023,5,B003S6GSBS,"If you saw the recent rubbish about the Atlanta Child Murder's by CNN reporter Soledad O'Brien, you owe it to yourself to see Mori's documentary. In two long hours, O'Brien did not interview a single person who took issue with the kangaroo court trial of Wayne Williams. Worse, the pro-prosecution documentary took cheap shots at lawyers representing Williams.
 Unfortunately, Williams did not do himself any favors by agreeing to the interview without the aid of legal counsel.
  Mori's documentary is the most objective investigation of the case. He shows not only how Williams could not have possibly killed all of the victims, and shows how the state and federal government framed Williams. The CNN documentary spent less than 60 seconds on the issue of Klan involvement in the murders, yet FBI William Webster called a press conference in April 1981 to announce that the FBI had a suspect --a white male -- whom it planned to arrest for killing the majority of the children as part of his bizarre bid to foment a ""race war."" Mori also interviews Deadman and others who get caught in misrepresentations. The so-called ""trilobal fibers"" which O'Brien accepted as unique, were in fact ubiquitous in commercial establishments around Atlanta during the killings. Some of the victims were killed or found near commercial establishments.
  There is clear evidence that the two girls were not part of the killing spree. There is also abundant evidence that some of the children were killed by a cult, while others were killed by the so-called Sanders family gang. The Sanders brothers are on audiotape talking about killing some of the victims.
  CNN suggests that the dog hairs found on some of the victims matched the Williams dog, but that's untrue. The Williams dog's hair was black and brown, whereas the hairs found on the victims were black and white.
  Shame on CNN. Totally biased reporting, and sloppy at that.",1277596800,21,1917,4.984326018808777
