5963221,4,B00F1W1S26,"Well-crafted documentary on the ""fandom"" that is Broooce!! A smartly edited collection of dozens of short (normally 1 to 2 min) home videos sent in from fans all across the world, SPRINGSTEEN & I is a humorous & heartfelt paean to New Jersey's #1 son (sorry Gov. Christie). Even if you're not a die hard Springsteen fan but do enjoy the odd, engaging Rock Doc you'll be entertained by these stories shared by both Boomers & Facebook Babies alike on how Bruce's Music & Concert experience has shaped their personas. Stand outs are testimonies by a pretty Asian Truck Driver with a Masters Degree; a soccer mom who insists on a Springsteen-Only playlist in her SUV while she drives her Kids around; the boyfriend of a British Fan who cannot appreciate the breadth of Bruce's Epic-Length Concerts, and a ""Philly"" Elvis impersonator being invited on-stage to perform an Elvis Medley with Bruce. One of the more existential clips was a dream-like silent, Black & White footage (probably on a cheap camera phone) shot through a car's front windshield, traveling down random roads at night; atmospheric & eerie, much like a lost, forgotten video to The River's ""Stolen Car"". The filmmaker's also generously add-in rarely seen brief bootleg live performances of Bruce going as far back to the 1970's. My only complaint was that their was little mention or footage of Bruce's Mythic Song Intro's & Storytelling (only shown on a risque rant about ""Red-Headed Woman"") that's always been an essential part of the Springsteen In-concert Experience. A way of connecting to both new & long-time fans that very few performers have ever been able to muster (Bob Dylan's aloofness would be the Anti-Bruce, no?). My Three Words to describe Bruce Springsteen? Talented - Intelligent - Approachable.",1384646400,,1778,5.010135135135135
5963222,5,B00F1W1S26,"A fantastic release.  For a Springsteen fan this is an emotional roller coaster as it is through our eyes that this film is produced.  I was worried the experience would be somehow lessened watching it at home after experiencing it in the theater with a crowd of other fans.  My concerns were quickly dispelled as I slipped on my headphones and sank into this movie at home.  I realized it wasn't just about the crowd and fans I was with, it gave me the opportunity to be more directly joined with the stories in the film and reflect on my own Springsteen connections.

The BD version is the same presentation as in the theater with four extra fan stories added as bonus features.  Admittedly, I wouldn't have missed them.  But if you haven't seen it, do not bypass the bonus footage from Hard Rock Calling 2012.  Nils' solo in Because the Night is one of he most powerful guitar solo's I have ever seen.

I predict that I will viewing this film quite frequently.",1383523200,7,963,4.488505747126437
5963223,5,B00F1W1S26,"This BD is a MUST for Springsteen fans, pure and simple. And it's not just because of the 77-minute ""film"" which was compiled from homemade videos (with some high quality equipment) made by fans around the globe, but because of the inserted ""archival performance footage"" in the film and the bonus features - including a 35-minute compilation of HD vide of five songs that Bruce and the E-streeters performed at the 2012 Hard Rock Calling concert in London.  Add another 28 minutes of interviews with some of the ""fan filmmakers"" and four short ""tributes to Bruce"" that didn't make the main feature and there is a lot of music here, mostly in HD. This was a ""Bruce authorized"" project and he meets the winning filmmakers at the end. The executive Producer is Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"" and more!).

The great surprises are when a fan tells their story of how they ""met Bruce"" and then the archivists dig up high quality footage (usually) of that moment.

You don't have to be a Bruce fan to love this package (well, not everyone is a fan, as a really funny moment in the film shows) but, if you are, you NEED this BD.

Note that while most other DVDs and Blu-rays from Eagle Vision include a booklet with notes and photos, there is no insert in this package.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5963224,5,B00F1W1S26,"What's more to add? If Bruce is involved in anything, it is guaranteed to be excellent.  This is the same film that I saw in the summer including meeting the fans, and a few live songs from July 2012 hard rock calling in London... A concert I attended-a great time was had by all.  There are also 4 short, fun films made by fans--nice addition.

5963225,5,B00F1W1S26,"Think you must be correct about the time of the Showtime version verses the DVD/BD release, JB. This is a post from the Bruce fanzine Backstreets' site: ""Eagle Rock Entertainment will release Springsteen & I in DVD and Blu-Ray formats on October 29. Based on what the audience saw at the recent big-screen Blu-Ray preview benefiting The Friends of The Bruce Springsteen Special Collection, the DVD/Blu-Ray will include everything featured in the film's initial theatrical screenings in July. That would be the complete documentary, six filmed performances from the 2012 Hard Rock Calling show (including Paul McCartney's appearance) and a brief, funny and moving epilogue to the documentary that involves Bruce meeting some of the fans featured in the film. As an additional bonus feature, there also will be several more fan-submitted clips that didn't make the final cut of Springsteen & I. The clips will be viewable in a separate suite of clips, concluding with the theatrical epilogue."" Certainly hope that's the case!",1382745600,7,1023,5.2439024390243905
5963226,4,B00F1W1S26,"This entertaining documentary film concentrates on die hard Bruce Springsteen fans: they tell us why they love the Boss so much and what are the sources of their fanaticism. Intercalated with interviews to the fans, are segments of concerts of Bruce. Sometimes, the fans appear in the clips: in perhaps the best segment, a fan who is also an Elvis impersonator narrates the time he got to sing with the boss in a concert after writing on a placard ""can the king sing with the boss"", and sure enough, the film shows footage of that very funny episode. Another segments I enjoyed: 1) Bruce's impromptu gig with a street musician;  2) a pretty, articulate young Asian woman who works as a truck driver (!) speaks of her love for Bruce and how he talks for people like her in blue collar jobs who do the tough physical job in society; 3) a British fan tells the story of how he was able to get front row seats for a concert in Madison Square Garden; 4) a young Bruce on a concert early on his career (a career that is now more than 40 years old!!) singing folk very much in the style of Bob Dylan. This film is not just for Bruce fans, though surely they would enjoy it most.",1382745600,14,1171,4.322727272727272

This movie is worth watching just for ""The Philly Elvis."" No spoiler here. This is a must see for any Bruce fan.

I have NOT seen the DVD released version and I am hoping it includes the all important epilogue where Bruce meets many of the people from the movie. Showtime did NOT air the epilogue, nor the the bonus tracks from Hyde Park. The DVD has a TRT of 1:46, so SOMETHING has been added as the original movie itself is a mere 1:15 or so.",1382745600,14,701,4.147058823529412

So those who were included better be worthy! I think the filmmakers did an ok job. It's hard not to just gush about Bruce if you like him. The Elvis dude was funny and humble and worthy of his 15 minutes of fame. Everyone else is very sincere. The Bruce clips in the movie were nice, in particular the Growing Up clip from who knows how long ago. I think I would have liked the movie more if there was more appreciation of just how special and talented an artist Bruce has been over the years. I would have included a few critical perspectives, nothing too long, just enough to provide appreciation of his extraordinary contribution to American culture in particular. The extra musical performances from London were a great addition, too. Many reasons to see this, but probably more for the longtime diehard fans than for those just coming to learn about Bruce's music and hugely generous persona.",1400284800,,1049,4.675675675675675

Basically this is home movies of people professing their love for Bruce and what he has meant to them.  A couple of stories were interesting, but most bordered on crazy.

5963293,4,B00F1W1S26,"This little film came and went quickly in the summer of 2013.  Produced by Ridley Scott and directed by Baillie Walsh, the film is a collection of mostly ""selfies"" shot with cell phones or small cameras.  Each describes the impact rock icon Bruce Springsteen has had on their lives.  Many are just short clips describing in 3 words how he or his music resonates with them.  Others have longer stories, some very interesting and include archival footage of events at a concert many years ago.

There is the Elvis impersonator who dressed for the part and sitting in the front row, is called up on the stage by Bruce and does a couple numbers.  There is the young Asian-American woman who is a truck driver, even though she has her masters degree.  One of the most eloquent is a Dane, who Walsh allows several segments.  Another is a woman who first saw Springsteen as a high school freshman in 1976.

Mr. Walsh is no newbie when it comes to musical pieces.  Back in 2001 he put together a collection of music videos for British trip-hop pioneers, Massive Attack.  What helps in moving things along, in what could be a yawning experience, are some truly remarkable outtakes from several Springsteen concerts dating back to the `70's as well as some homemade footage.  What comes across is that Bruce Springsteen, now entering his 50th year as a professional musician, has touched many people with his personality, generosity and every-man persona and of course his music.

Admittedly, the documentary will appeal mostly to fans and people who just want to understand what all the fuss is about.  But it is a well done assemblage, flush with humor that can be enjoyed by any film lover.",1389830400,,1683,4.719178082191781

However, the only bad part is the label says the running time is 146 minutes, so he was surprised when the movie actually ended at around 76 minutes. I guess they include the ""bonus"" material as part of the running time. Regardless, he enjoyed it and would recommend it to any Springsteen fan.",1389052800,,428,4.3625

Fun for ages 9 to 90.",1388880000,,603,4.921568627450981

I know how everyone loves him, myself included, but really after 1/2 hour of listening to everyone rave about him, it gets old. The fan clips just go on way to long, you sit there saying ""who cares."" They should have spent more time on concert footage intertwined with fan comments. Also there was way too little of the E Street Band, they are an important part of the Bruce Springsteen story.  It was so great to see some of those really old clips, but they were short lived and then cut off to another story that took too long to tell. I expect more from Ridley Scott, he should stick to what he does best, which is obviously not this type of story.",1388620800,,772,4.280821917808219

5963313,5,B00F1W1S26,"This is a documentary about Springsteen from his fans. It is a moving and at times, poignant account from the fans' perspective on how Springsteen and his music have impacted upon their lives. There are also quite a few humorous moments in the film that had me laughing till tears streamed down my face. Some fans, on the other hand, may find some of the moments in the film a bit over the top. I don't find that to be the case at all thinking back on all the times I went out of my way to see a Springsteen concert. From this point of view, I think the film will most appeal to the die hard fans. There is also concert footage interspersed throughout the film showing Springsteen performing with the passion that has drawn legions of fans to him. At the end of the film, there is some footage of the 2012 Hard Rock concert in London in which Paul McCartney makes a guest appearance. This film is a rare treasure taken from a different angle not typical of your usual concert film footage.",1387152000,,989,4.32258064516129

Words fail to describe what community joy we all give and receive, but it was wonderful to feel it once again through this DVD.

I'm a very tame fan in comparison.
