8249531,5,B00139VX08,"""James Douglas, internationally renowned gundog trainer, presents this Cabela's video with some of America's premier professional pointing dog trainers, Harold Adams, Chuck Hyde, and Dave Macumber, all from Iowa. Between them these top trainers cover every aspect of training the upland dog, using the best of the traditional, and the latest training methods. Harold's easy style and gift of communication gives you the feeling that you are having a private training session with a friend who is talking straight to you. This is not just a training video, but a real pleasure to be enjoyed time and time again by anyone interested in pointers and working bird dogs. Beautifully filmed with spectacular sequences of the dogs in action. This video will give you complete confidence to train your own dog as it takes you along each step from a young puppy through every aspect of its training, from its earliest discipline, introduction to game pointing, introduction to shot, progressing forward to a top class trailing standard working bird dog. There is no more comprehensive video anywhere.""",1481241600,,1092,5.2102272727272725
