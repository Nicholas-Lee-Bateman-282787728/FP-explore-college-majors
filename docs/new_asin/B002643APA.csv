DVD advertises that it teaches you licks, riffs and rolls and that is not included.",1514160000,,143,4.72

8351840,2,B002643APA,"If you're looking to get started on the keyboard then DON'T buy this DVD.  If you're wanting to learn how to play the piano, this is the DVD for you!  ""What's the difference?""  When playing piano, one uses sheet music.  When playing the keyboard, one uses chord sheets or lead sheets.  The lead sheets tell what chords to play and it's all up to you to improvise between chords.  There's no reading music involved.  Keyboards let you jam out, just like a guitarist.

98% of this DVD is learning how to read sheet music and the fingering you would use on a piano.  This is not at all what I wanted to learn.

Also, this DVD advertises that it teaches you licks, riffs and rolls.  There is none of that to be found on this disc.  It's strictly a piano teaching tool.

If you're wanting to learn piano, this DVD could be very instrumental (no pun intended).  The instructor gives very clear, precise information with great close-ups of what she's doing on the keyboard.

It's a good disc, they just need to change the name of it to Piano 1, instead of Keyboard 1.",1394668800,,1060,4.391752577319588
8351841,5,B002643APA,This is a great instructional DVD I wish they were all like this. She moves right along and really gives you plenty of good stuff. I really like it.,1392681600,,148,4.137931034482759
