8139451,3,B000HEWGZQ,"The  NOVA Documentaries - Battle for the X Planes and the Top Gun over Moscow are good. But the other two simply lack scope or information - they are like news or adventure documentaries.

These documentaries are finally of late 1990s vintage and lack much information on the present day advances. In particular the DVD- Spies that Fly is based only on old information . But it all helps in building an understaning of the issues.

The Battle of the X-Planes too is somewhat like a news documentary . It does reveal though how the Boeing design was an original design, fundamentally different from the Lockheed Martin Design and why it lost out. But it does not reveal or talk about the fact that the winning Lockheed Martin Design for F-35 is very similar to the Russian Yakovlev YAK 141 aircraft which made its flight at the Farnbrough Air Show in 1993. And how the Yakovlev Design Bureau from 1995 onwards helped the Lockheed Martin design the wining X-Plane. May be then it would have become a real news documentary.  Still it is interesting.

A much better Documentary anyday on the evolution of military aviation is the four part  PBS Documentary - Warplane- also available on Amazon. That one is really an aviation technology and war history documentary. Check that out.",1192060800,2,1277,4.755656108597285

I haven't watched it all, but there is one of the videos that they thry to recover an old abandon plane. It is so done the american way. poor. instead of thrying to fix re-fix and fix over what was fixed, they just simply get the rid of the old stuff and put brand new stuff. COME ON. use your ingenuity. still it did not work. my father, who knows about this. was pointing mistake over mistake.

there is another reason why this is so American. They only show American planes. Be a little more open minded. the world is larger. also the Amrican aircraft moddles came from copied or stolen designs of other countries inventions, or design in America by foreigners.

still is something that will let you burn time. but definitely ita can be better.",1167868800,3,853,4.3924050632911396
