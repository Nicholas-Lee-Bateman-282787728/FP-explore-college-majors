7914686,3,B00001QGJI,"I was glad to get this because of Rachel ""Enemy at the Gates"" Weisz. She played such a strong role there I hoped so here too. The movie is needlessly vague about the beginning events that cause all the trouble. We don't need all the details but we could have easily had most of them & been none the wiser for the ending.

There is an incestuous relationship that serves no purpose except breast shot. She could have played her nude parts with people outside her family only. Incest, for a reason is OK for films. For this reason it's a distraction which sort of fits in with the needlessly mysterious storyline.

I had a hard time with Rachel's performance until the last scene was unveiled. I would have been surprised at the end even if given the undisclosed beginning & would have enjoyed the character interplay much more. This tried to be the Twilight Zone & hurt the quality of the movie & the enjoyment of the viewers.

Bad writing hurt the male lead, the young male supporting actor & there was a sense the bad boy from prison was only an abuser of women & was probably someone's baby while in the joint. All of the actors performed above the material given even Ms. Incest. The acting is better than the movie or direction allows & brought this up to 3 stars. If you buy this for Rachel, watch it clear to the end. It explains why she played her character as she did.",1264723200,,1376,4.3671875
7914687,4,B00001QGJI,"This is a very good, very different and very memorable film.  I came upon it by accident, but I'm so glad I did. Michael Winterbottom's original and atmospheric film is about Martin(Alessandro Nivola) who's just been released from prison & comes back to his seaside hometown to see his ex-girlfriend Helen(Rachel Weisz), who is less than pleased to see him for obvious & not so obvious reasons.  At one point Martin uses Elvis Costello's ""I want you"" plays as a serenade/seduction for Helen.  The only reason I mention this- is because for some it might be noteworthy to mention Alessandro & Rachel were dating in real life at the time & you can definitely see & feel their chemistry together.  Also, there's an interesting side story involving a voyeuristic tween & his sexually free older sister.  I loved this movie, but as another reviewer mentioned...this film is only available on a region 2 & 0 DVD, neither of which play on a regular player. I hope it'll be released in Region 1 for us in the states & hopefully it has a few extras too.  I have the region 0 version from Australia & should note that there are zero features, it just plays the movie.  There's not even a menu, subtitles or trailers.",1263686400,5,1206,4.607476635514018
7914688,4,B00001QGJI,"the only problem i have with this dvd is that it would only play on a region free dvd player, in other words it was a great movie.  thank you",1252713600,,141,3.7
7914689,5,B00001QGJI,"I WANT YOU is the fascinating coming-of-age account of 14-year old professional voyeur, Honda, a mute Balkan orphan emigre, whose link to the world is through his obsessive collection of rather dark data using his inexplicably high-tech sound and video equipment (yep, we're dealing with meta-cinema here). He spends most of his time observing his friend and the object of his affection, hairdresser Helen (yes, Rachel Weisz), and her sociopathic, recently released on parole ex-bf Martin (Alessandro Nivola, LAUREL CANYON). Desensitized to sexuality by his promiscuous, carefree older sister who sings in a Sade-meets-Portishead band and sleeps in the adjacent room, Honda may be gathering explicit material, but he's not some peeping tom getting off; rather, he's trying desperately to make sense of the madness of the adults in the world around him. (Interestingly enough, despite all the sex scenes in the film the most sensual moment involves the shampooing and cutting of hair.) Yet despite all his empirical evidence, Honda can't see what is around the corner, what he will finally learn from these star-crossed lovers (nor can we guess, or maybe I'm just slow). Actually, Honda's sister puts it best when, while naked, she's asked if she feels guilty about what she does. Her response made me reflect (and yes this is purely subjective, and no, this should not be some great revelation) on the fact that we tend to tolerate violence and insanity in this country while shunning anything so natural as the human body and what it is supposed to do (especially with regard to movies, which mirror our hang-ups).

Fresh off a first viewing, it seems to me there are so many amazing things going on in this film - the brilliant use of color (contrasting yellows and blues, public and private), stirring images that lodge themselves in your brain, and the very generous way in which Michael Winterbottom refuses to judge his brilliant enacted principal characters - that it is rather upsetting to see it is being so horribly misunderstood. The unfortunately packaged I WANT YOU might be seem at first glance like a thriller with an underdeveloped plot, but the word 'meditation' is far more appropriate here. Don't expect a genre work-out - let the images reveal the characters and the story (it's a movie, not a book!!!), stop waiting for convoluted plot twists, and then this movie just might pull the rug out from under you as it did me. Or maybe not, b/c if you haven't already guessed the movie is not for all tastes. And that's ok.

All this from an Elvis Costello song. Very impressive, Mr. Winterbottom. For something more accessible, check out his brilliant WELCOME TO SARAJEVO with Woody Harrelson. I can't think of a more varied and inventive filmmaker working today. Hopefully you can get a hold of this movie somehow: I came across a promo copy thru dumb luck in a - ha! - church book and video sale.",1122595200,3,2914,4.9087221095334685
7914690,4,B00001QGJI,"This may be an entirely fanboy attitude, but I WANT YOU is by no stretch of the imagination a great film by any measure.  It doesn't boast one tremendous storyline you'll not soon forget once the ending is near.  It doesn't bluster with great social significance.  It doesn't offer a moral statement by which the world can be a better place.
Simply put, I WANT YOU is a character piece that revolves entirely around the incredible Rachel Weisz.  Modesty aside, she's a beautiful woman, and the sexually explicit scenes played out here are not only tastefully well-done but appear to be closer to ""real sex"" than ""cinema sex.""  It's the subtle nuances that Weisz brings to her character -- yes, in even the non-sex scenes -- that shows her true talent and gift with the camera.
Frankly, I'm amazed that she isn't getting more artistic work, based on the grace she shows in I WANT YOU.",1064448000,18,883,4.634615384615385
7914691,5,B00001QGJI,"Find Rachel Weisz, and ........congradulate her on her A+ performance in I Want You. Not a good movie for younger kids though. It is very sexually oriented. The plot is simple really, but there are a lot of skeletons in the closet in this movie. I think the characters are very easy to get interested. I like how the characters move through only one set though. I give it a four thumbs way way up!",998438400,7,397,4.306666666666667
7914692,5,B00001QGJI,"I was going to buy this movie straight off of amazon. But I wanted to rent it first. When I saw it was on the Sundance film channel, I got so excited. Rachel did an exellent job as Helen. I thought she put a lot of depth into the character, but there were a few sceens where I thought the movie was a bit much, but I like how the characters were all intertwined. Helen's character was kind of confusing at times though. Because one minute she is giving his flowers back and the next she is ripping her tights off for him. But it was really well thought out. A++",997920000,5,561,4.063063063063063
7914693,4,B00001QGJI,"I Want You was really interesting. I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz, and after reading that this was her favorite movie to make, I decided to buy it. The plot is good, and the characters were kind of unique. I wavered between feeling sorry for Helen, and wondering if she was what she wanted everyone to think she was. You don't really know what happened to her father; she tells Honda, but I wonder if that was the truth. And you wonder why she is so uncomfortable with men...though she seems pretty compliant when her ex comes to town, though maybe a little regretful. All in all it's a good movie, not your typical formulaic Hollywood trash.",994464000,3,637,4.452991452991453
