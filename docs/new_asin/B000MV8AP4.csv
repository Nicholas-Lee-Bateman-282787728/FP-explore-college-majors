2749966,1,B000MV8AP4,This is a terrific movie starting in the second third of the film. My problem is with the format and presentatiion. This Venom movie features some of the best fight choreography of the classic Shaw Brothers quality and some company should issue a remastered wide screen edition of it. This version is full screen with muddy colors and dull picture quality. If there is another version of this movie --buy that.,1204329600,,410,4.788732394366197
2749967,5,B000MV8AP4,"This is one of the less known ""old school"" kung fu classics made by Shaw Brothers with some of the ""Venoms"" stars. The fights are great, most notably the one with the double-broadsword hero hopelessly taking on several bad guys alone. MOST UNUSUAL WEAPON: Giant two-handed hammer that looks like a big brass pumpkin. Really.",1047600000,8,324,4.909090909090909
8172644,5,B000MV8AP4,"I always like the Venoms, this is one of the best put together fight sequences. It also displays Wu Shu fighting styles which wasn't nationally recognized  i.e. ""known"" in the United States back in the in the 1970's and early 1980's. 00",1517616000,,236,4.619047619047619

8172647,4,B000MV8AP4,This is another very good movie but in the first few minutes it goes from english to chinese but back to english but it is not a big deal I gave it 4 stars only because they have to get it right there are other movies that all have the same problem but over all worth watching or I would have tossed it also it's know as another movie so check before you buy it,1468713600,,361,3.8266666666666667

8172652,3,B000MV8AP4,Pretty cool film with the venoms. Took a while to really get to the fighting but a glad still to add to the collection.,1425427200,,119,4.0
8172653,5,B000MV8AP4,"Visually, this copy is clear and crisp. Only once did the audio click out. Normally not a venoms fan after House of Traps, I was reluctant to watch this. I was dead wrong. This movie is your basic story line, but the action at the end will leave you amazed. The skill shown with the weapons is beyond good. Get this, make some pop corn and enjoy this with your Fu friends.",1417046400,3,372,4.180555555555555
