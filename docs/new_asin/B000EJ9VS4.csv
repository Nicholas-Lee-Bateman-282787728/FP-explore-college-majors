2521670,5,B000EJ9VS4,"Full Moon starts of like a million other shoujo anime titles, a sickly heroine with a dream, a dose of magic, a clear direction for the plot. It all seems so formulaic, but Full Moon breaks the mold for this type of show with its plot twists, tragedies, and triumphs.

Mitsuki is a 12 year old girl who has a dream to become a well known singer, in order to convey her unspoken love to a boy she met while living in an orphanage. Mitsuki, however, has throat cancer, and refuses to get an operation for it because it will harm her vocal chords.

Eichi, the object of Mitsuki's affection was adopted and taken to America, while Mitsuki went to live with her maternal grandmother, a wealthy woman with traditional tastes, and an utter dislike for music.
Because Mitsuki likes music, her grandmother has her live in a guest house rather than the main house.

One day, two shinigami (spirits who escort the souls of the dead to their appointed place) appear in her room, discussing Mitsuki's fate - she has one year to live, and they will be by her side until her time comes. For some reason (covered in the manga the series is based on), Mitsuki is able to see the shinigami and hear their conversation.

Since Mitsuki only cares about being able to sing, and is not worried about dying, the shinigami decide to help her accomplish her dream of being a singer so she lives out her last year in hope.

As a series with a focus on music, Full Moon has a very nice soundtrack, although the main songs are used very often, and can get repetitive.

A recipe for something that would normally be slushy and sappy turns into something much better as the series unfolds.

Full Moon has a plot that is much more intricate than what is seen on the surface, it has endearing, believable characters, and one of the finest endings you will ever see in any medium, any genre.

2521671,1,B000EJ9VS4,This was horrible to watch because the english dub sucked so bad. The manga was so much better. I wouldn't waste my money on buying the english version when the Japanese version is so much better.,1175644800,,196,4.472222222222222
2521672,5,B000EJ9VS4,"I watched the first two volumes of this anime and I can say that it is hooking and interesting that I couldn't get enough of it. Ok! I know that the English dub is horrible, so I went for the Japanese language with the English subtitles. I always go for the Japanese with the English subtitles because it sounds more original. If you can just overlook the English dub, you will love this anime for sure.

The story is about a 12-year-old Mitsuki who wants desperately to become a singer, so she can fulfill her promise to her first love, Eichi. She always wanted to be a singer but her grandmother is against her dream because she is blaming Mitsuki's father who used to be a singer, for her daughter's death. There is another problem, which is that she has a malignant tumor in her throat and she has to go through an operation but she might lose her voice with this operation, so she refuses to go through with it.

That's when she met the two death spirits, Takuto and Meroko. Takuto will make her into a beautiful 16-year-old girl in order to have a chance in the audition and she won. She then decided on her stage name to be, Full Moon.

I wonder what will happen with Mitsuki and Takuto because it seems that Takuto has a crush on her. I like Takuto so much and I wish that he and Mitsuki will end up together.

I liked the Ending theme, ""New Future"" of the first six episodes. It is so beautiful.

If you're interested, you can also read the manga. I have all the volumes except for the final seventh volume, which is going to be released this month. There is a slight difference between the manga and the anime in some of the scenes but I liked the anime more.

Try to watch it and you are not going to regret it, if you can just overlook the English dub.",1159660800,6,1764,4.250746268656717
2521673,1,B000EJ9VS4,"This is the most horrible dub ever! Since when did they find AMATAURS to do their voices?! Seriously, Eichi deserves a better voice than that! And Takuto? I think my pet rock does better!",1155254400,,187,4.529411764705882
2521674,2,B000EJ9VS4,"I've watched a lot of dubbed animes, but this has gotta be the worst ever.  Although it's arguable in which is the worst, watch it yourself to see.  Watching the first few minutes I thought ""ok, this isn't too terribly bad,"" but then it took a dive for the worst: Viz left the original Japanese voice actor's singing in for Mitsuki!  The sad thing is, the American voice and Japanese voice don't even sound alike so I was like ""she's singing?!.""  I have seen a lot of things.  What you're paying for in this DVD is basically the English dub.  The English version takes so many liberties on the characters' pasts that it's not even funny.  I could almost swear that Viz ripped the script straight from a FanSub and changed a few lines to Americanize it.",1153008000,2,752,4.445255474452555
2521675,5,B000EJ9VS4,"I've watched a lot of anime in both english dub and subtitled. To me everything is perfect about this series. Mitsuki Kouyama is such an innocent character that you'll fall in love with because she's so dedicated to her singing that she'll risk her life for it. Takuto and Meroko are quite a pair too. Meroko means well but she always causes trouble for poor Mitsuki and is often the comic relief. It may be a little slow paced at times, but overall it is one of the best anime if you're into romance with the typical drama. It is more upbeat than the manga though, and there are significant differences, but sometimes you may need some tissues handy. ;)

I've only seen the first couple episodes in english so far, but I love the voices. They fit so perfectly! This is a must buy. They didn't dub the songs though, prob because they couldn't possibly compare to the originol! Anywayz you won't be disappointed. =)",1152835200,3,914,4.506024096385542
2521676,5,B000EJ9VS4,"All Mitsuki Koyama wants to do more than anything else in the world is sing.  She faces a few obsticles, though.  First, she's too young to make the auditions; second, her grandmother and guardian hates music and anything or anyone associated with it; and she is suffering from throat cancer.

Her life changes with the appearance of a pair of shinigami (death gods) whom only she can see.  Mitsuki ends up living a double life, trying to balance the life of a grade school student and a new singing idol, all while keeping secrets from most everyone.

The shinigamis gave her only a year to live.  How long can she keep things going?

This is an excellent story.  It can get intensely emotional at times, though, so parents should prescreen for younger viewers.",1149552000,7,762,4.676691729323308

8110611,5,B000EJ9VS4,"This is such a beautiful anime that anyone of all ages is sure to enjoy!
First, let me discuss the DVD itself...
This DVD contains the first four (4) episodes of the Full Moon wo Sagashite anime, in both English and Japanese. It also includes a ""sneak preview"" - the first (dubbed) episode on a separate DVD so that you can give it to your friends and get them into the series, too! It's well worth the price.
As for the anime, FMwS is the story of a twelve-year-old girl named Mitsuki Kouyama who dreams of becoming a singer. Unfortunately, she has a throat tumor that prevents her from singing in a loud voice. One day, two Shinigami (Harbingers of Death) appear before her and tell her she's only got one year left to live. Her determination to achieve her dream inspires them, and they use their powers to turn her into a healthy sixteen-year-old girl so she can use the remainder of her life to follow her dream.
This anime has beautiful artwork and amazing music, and I must admit that I've already seen the entire series multiple times. It's one that I'd recommend for anyone and everyone, with themes of love, friendship, and perseverance through hard times.",1426291200,,1166,4.583732057416268
8110612,5,B000EJ9VS4,This DVD has the first four episodes of the series. I really like this series I already have the manga version of this series. Both are very good but it's easier to appreciate the music when you can listen to it.,1367366400,,212,4.195121951219512
8110613,5,B000EJ9VS4,This series is an excellent cultural component for a middle school Japanese language curriculum.  The kids love the animae.  It is best employed using Japanese audio with English subtitles.,1361318400,,189,5.482758620689655
8110614,4,B000EJ9VS4,"Mitsuki is 12 years old, and dreams of being a singer. Sadly, she has a tumor in her throat. She promised the boy she loves that she will become a famous singer one day, and that her voice will reach him in America. One day, a couple of death spirits visit and tell her that she has a year to live. They reluctantly decide to help her achieve her dreams. She can change into a 16-year-old version of herself with no tumor. She is on her way to stardom and uses the stage name, ""Full Moon"".\

This anime is really fun. There are several very good characters, decent animation, and a good soundtrack. The story is very cute. It has lots of comedy, drama, and some romance. I am very happy that I came across this adorable series. I only have 2 complaints. 1: They only dubbed season 1. The 2nd season is hard to find, and in Japanese only. 2: The dub is very mediocre. I have heard many that are worse, but they didn't spend much on this dub. It isn't as bad as others may lead you to believe though. Aside from those 2 little flaws, this is a great series with a fun and infectious vibe. I highly recommend it.",1359763200,,1109,4.182242990654205
8110615,4,B000EJ9VS4,"I watched this series hoping it would be cleaner than the manga. [Mainly because I try to buy stuff my younger siblings can enjoy with me] The manga is way better as far as story goes, but I kinda liked the anime too. The anime had more of a peppy happy feel than the tragedy themed manga. The Japanese cast do an excellent job, the voices are better then you could imagine and help you take the more light hearted version of the story alot more seriously. But the English cast. Lets face it. They totally suck. Everyone sounds like they recorded the show in an hour. Plus Mitsuki, who`s supposed to hardly be able to talk never seems to have trouble talking, and she sounds super whinny. So when she coughs it seems kinda random and out of place.
All in all, I personally think the anime, even thought it totally diverts from the manga, is sweet and enjoyable. I kinda find it alot more funny too, but there's still a bitter sweetness to it. Just DON`T watch it with ENGLISH DUB!!! They suck, and that`s probably why you never hear these voice actors in the top anime shows. If you want to watch this anime without finding it corny then just deal with the subtitles.",1296172800,,1167,4.382488479262673
8110616,5,B000EJ9VS4,"I absolutely love this series, so I'll try to be as short and sweet about this as possible. This is a very lovely, endearing story about twelve-year-old Mitsuki (which actually means  a 'full moon' in Japanese). This anime is adapted from a shoujo manga by Arina Tanemura, who has created the most beautiful manga I've ever read. While she tends to reuse certain character facial types, etc. which she has created, if you can get over this she has a talent which is not matched by very many manga-ka.  In fact, the repetitive look of the characters can actually make you like her even more as her work is easily recognizable. Not only are the facial expressions bewitching, the clothing she gives her characters at certain times are elaborate and interestingly outlandish.  The anime is not quite as detailed as her original artwork, however this is the case with most manga-based titles.

Now, about Mitsuki. Singing is her passion, but it is not an empty ambition driven by glory...she wants to sing in order to attract the attention of a special someone in her life who was separated from her long ago. She has a voice that could rival any Japanese pop-idol to boot. There's just one problem...

She has a cancerous polyp in her throat which doesn't allow her to sing in a loud voice.

So how does she overcome this and win the heart of the boy she has been longing to contact? And how will she climb the staircase to fame?

I won't spoil the whole plot, since you want to find that out on your own. What I will say is that the animation is very true to Tanemura's unique style, and very pleasing to the eyes, which is what is important for this genre. The characters other than Mitsuki are also instantly lovable, almost fairy-tale like but with a modern twist. This series is targeted at younger teenage girls, however I think there's something everyone will enjoy about this series. It is very hope instilling, and while there are serious moments there is also a good balance between these times and the comic relief.

The only complaint I have is that the ending sequence has...no sequence. At the end of the show you just hear the closing song, and the credits roll against a pink starry screen. Luckily the song is good enough to keep your attention. The opening theme song is very upbeat, and while The ' Scanty (the group who sings the opening theme) was grating on my ears at first, I find myself dancing to the theme song now. It is I' LOVE YOU, a very catchy j-pop number.

You can get the individual DVDs on Amazon for a very reasonable price (I believe volume two or three costs $8.00 total), so I would suggest to buy it on this website.

Any shoujo anime fan cannot be without Full Moon wo Sagashite. In an anime world of harems, vampires and guns, Full Moon stands alone as the series for anyone who's looking for something different and refreshing.",1270598400,,2868,4.551456310679612
8110617,4,B000EJ9VS4,"This is a heartwarming and sweet story of a little girl struggling against her fate to achieve her dreams, with the help of her supernatural friends. It starts off with young Mitsuki being told by her stern grandmother that she cannot go to a voice audition because it would be harmful to her health, since she has a growth in her throat. Suddenly, two ""shinigami"" (death gods, or spirit reapers) appear before her. Surprised that she can see them, they reluctantly inform her that they're there to watch over the year she has left before her appointed death, to make sure nothing interferes with fate and that she can die peacefully. After some plucky hijinks, she convinces them that if she has only a year left, then she simply MUST try to achieve her dream of becoming a singer, and they help her go to the audition by transforming her into a healthy older teen. She wins and is selected to debut as a new pop idol, Full Moon! She's got a year to sing her heart out, hoping her feelings and message can reach the hearts of those she loves~

Although the subject matter seems rather heavy - she's going to die in a year! Can she become a pop idol before then with the help of her new reaper pals?? - it's actually very sweet and intriguing to watch and I don't think it's at all too scary or dark for it's intended audience of young 'tween and jr high age girls. Rather than her impending death causing constant drama, most episodes are about Mitsuki trying hard to become a respectable and beloved singer, her purity and tenacity reminding people she meets along the way of what your dreams and singing from the heart are really about. Readers of the manga should be warned that the anime and manga are drastically different in places and can't really be substituted for one another.

I saw this show years ago when it was originally shown in the morning in Japan, and a friend thankfully helped me track it down years later. The premise of Mitsuki doing a magical transformation so she can grow up fast and be a singer before she dies of throat cancer bowled me over as so very Japanese, but the entire thing was also charming and hopeful and sucked me right in. While the tone is light and shiny, the show doesn't let you forget that there are heavier elements in play in the larger storyline, but also doesn't let those elements bog you down. Rather than being a weepy soap opera, the story focuses on Mitsuki's life in the music industry and in junior high school, with breakaway pop hits scattered throughout the series run as Mitsuki's singing career progresses.

This is a fun and warm show to watch to the heart-wrenching conclusion, which is why the slow (and possibly halted?!) release schedule is such a shame. With 52 episodes, this series would end up being around 11-13 DVDs - a sizable investment to purchase, and a long time to wait for a series to be completed. I wish Viz had released this in two or three sets rather than 4-5 episodes per disc. Then I surely would've snapped up the entire run all at once~",1248134400,,3029,4.493647912885662
