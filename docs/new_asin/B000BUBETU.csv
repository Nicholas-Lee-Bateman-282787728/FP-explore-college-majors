8092771,5,B000BUBETU,"Ah Charlie Chaplin, a true pioneer of the slapstick comedy. I actually used to watch Chaplin shorts as a kid (rare for someone of my age I'm sure) because my parents were big fans of him. He has a bizarre, physical sort of humor, but as evidenced in this short film, Chaplin would also use symbolic humor in his work (the scene where the immigrants get roped off as soon as they see the Statue of Liberty is a brilliant use of editing to create a humorous contrast). Definitely buy this if you want to get an idea of where cinema's comedy genre got started and if your in the mood for a laugh.",1303948800,4,593,4.2105263157894735
