2202746,5,B000777HY8,"""The Hillz"" is a wonderful modern day drama from first time writer and director Saran Barnun. Barnun describes the film as ""a modern day Shakespearean tragedy, kind of like ""American Pie"" meets ""Pulp Fiction"" with a dash of ""A Clockwork Orange"". It combines violence with witty humour. Cleverly written, ""The Hillz"" features strong performances from young actors like Rene Heger, Jesse Woodrow and Jason Shaw. Even Paris Hilton does a good job playing ""the unattainable"" Heather. Definitely worth seeing.",1110153600,3,504,5.3924050632911396

2202763,1,B000777HY8,"At one point in this movie, one of the characters says, ""I feel like I'm on some after-school special from hell."" That about sums it up.

This movie feels like it was written and directed by a stoned 13-year-old boy who was trying (but utterly failing) to channel ""Kids,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Beverly Hills 90210,"" ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""Bully,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" and ""Spun,"" all in the same movie. Apparently this was the only movie ever made by writer-director Saran Barnun. There are good reasons for that.

I watched the movie for three reasons. First, it's ranked as one of the worst movies of all time on IMDB. (It's currently #103 worst.) Second, it has Paris Hilton in it. And third, the movie can be streamed for free with my Amazon Prime membership.

From the very beginning of the movie, I fought the urge to turn it off and avoid wasting 91 minutes of my life. But somehow I made it through the first 10 minutes. At that point, I actually started to enjoy it in a twisted way, and was able to make it to the (ridiculously bad) ending.

The dialogue, plot, action, special effects, and camera work are laugh-out-loud bad. The acting, for the most part, is also terrible. (Rene Heger as lead thug ""Duff"" actually puts in a pretty solid performance.)

The movie follows a gang of entitled teenage lowlifes who are fresh out of high school in southern California and always up to no good. The plot is practically nonexistent. In general, almost every event in the film is completely meaningless, especially when violence is involved, and that is often. It's as if the filmmakers' goals are to show as many murders as possible, and to make each one more meaningless than the one before.

The only dramatic tension in the film involves the protagonist's struggles to break free from the rest of the gang and do something with his life, and his quest to win the heart of his longtime crush (Paris Hilton's character). Paris only appears in a few scenes, but she plays her part well--a spoiled, vapid, self-centered, superficial tramp. The part was undoubtedly written specifically for Paris.

Probably the worst thing about the movie is the ending. I won't spoil anything (even though there's not much to spoil), but suffice it to say that the ending is even more pointless and poorly conceived than the rest of the movie.

If you enjoy watching movies so bad they've gone past good and back to bad again (Ghost World reference), then you should give this a shot. Otherwise, steer clear of this awful film.",1418515200,,2511,4.703872437357631

The editing is awful, absolute crap. There is literally a heart-iris in this movie, no really. There are flashbacks and other time changes that make no sense and shots are reused frequently.
The writing is garbage, it's impossible to take any of the characters seriously at all. One of the guys, while trying to be a badass, actually says, ""man, I'm cereal"" instead of saying ""serious"". No really that's in the movie. None of the characters develop at at and are poorly defined to begin with. All of the plot elements barely make sense, nobody's motivations are clear and NOTHING is resolved in the end. Paris Hilton happens to appear in the movie, even though she doesn't really need to, her character actually directly says to the main character that she only dates guys for their money, but he still is in love with her for the rest of the movie.
Basically this is beyond horrible, like you couldn't imagine, and it's fantastic.

The only thing working for this movie is just how bad it is.  I was flipping around last night and caught it coming on Showtime.  Out of curiosity, I decided to watch the first few minutes and, before I knew it, I was completely mesmerized by how utterly terrible this movie was in every possible respect. I mean, if the movie had been just bad--as opposed to an absolute train wreck--I certainly would've stopped watching it.  But this movie was so mindblowingly terrible that I simply couldn't turn away.

The rest of the flick had me so intralled I didn't even get up to take a piss (despite the fact I was stinkin drunk). The next day i went out and rented it and made my bother watch it.

2202779,1,B000777HY8,"*minor spoilers (not that reading them would help you understand this film)*

Narrated from the perspective of pseudo-protagonist Steve 5 (Jesse Woodrow), ""The Hillz"" is one of the more recent cinematic enterprises attempting to illustrate (invent?) a particularly sad genre of American culture:  that of young, bored, and rich white men seeking to acquire ""street cred"" by adopting a philosophy consisting primarily of women, drugs, death, and money.  Steve, his pal Duff (Rene Heger), and some toadies lead a pointless existence as children growing up in Beverly Hills.  Driven to hedonistic pursuits, wanting for nothing, and lacking any moral compass, the film follows these friends as their lives deteriorate around them.  It seems that pampered affluence is helpless to prevent one's slide towards a violent death in the `hood.

*end minor spoilers*

My obsession with obtaining ""maximum value"" from my purchases is to blame for my watching of this disaster.  I feel compelled to watch as many movies as my cable company (and my personal time) allow, as long as they are selected only from the ""free on demand"" group of films.  Occasionally, this practice unearths a gem I would not have viewed otherwise.  More often, I find myself trapped in the midst of a stampede of inappropriate musical timing, terrible acting, nonexistent directing, miscast after miscast, and writing which suggests English was the screenwriter's third language, as in this film.  Unfortunately, that is not the limit of my cinematic pathology, for once I begin a movie, I cannot ""just turn it off.""  I have never walked out of a movie.  I have never paused a movie to listen to something one of my many now-ex-girlfriends was saying.  I even sat through the entire travesty otherwise known as ""The Postman"" (the Kevin Costner one), at the same time a particularly raucous party was occurring in my own residence!

Compared to this movie, erstwhile horror-schlock tripe like ""El Chupacabra"" acquires depth.  It is an extremely sad thing when the talent of Paris Hilton is the only thing that rises above the putrefied morass making up most of this film's content.  Well, perhaps ""rise above"" is a generous designation for her almost invisible contribution to this film.  There is really no conceivable reason for anyone to view this movie.  Even if you harbor such unimaginably bad taste in women so as to lust after Paris Hilton, please spare your damaged psyche further pain and ""Google-image"" her, instead.  Halfway through this movie I wondered if I was perhaps the victim of a grand practical joke, and ""The Hillz"" was really a subtle parody of Hollywood's glorification of rich, impotent fools masquerading as young thugs.  Alas, the viewer realizes that this movie indeed attempts serious-storytelling, before time and again reverting back to inanity, random deaths, and ho-hum bursts of pointless violence.

This film makes the similarly-themed and mediocre ""Havoc"" seem downright monumental.  Not even valuable as entertaining B-movie ""so-bad-it's-good"" fare (a la ""Night of the Comet"").  Avoid at all costs, if you value your soul.",1179619200,13,3122,5.18562874251497

Don't buy it if you just want to see Paris, she's not in it much, but still has a respectable role and does a fair job, the director uses her wisely.

2202784,1,B000777HY8,"If you are watching the DVD jacket of `The Hillz' and thinking that Paris Hilton is the star of the film, you are utterly mistaken. She is only third-billed, and the story about those  affluent and spoiled kids in Hillz has virtually little to do with her supporting role. You know this kind of thing sometimes happens when some filmmakers or company are desperately trying to cash in on the presence of celebrity in the film, and uses his or her name to attract the unsuspecting customers like me.

But even so, you know, things turn out unexpected sometimes, and if you're lucky, you find an amazing film ignored by many. No such luck here. `Hillz' clearly wants to be a gangster film with humor, but gangster part is terribly clich-ridden, and humor part is just crude and unpleasant.

In short this is what you see. Imagine one nice guy who want to go to college, but cannot decide it because he is so nice (or indecisive) that he cannot leave his bad friends. One of the bad friends happens to be a trigger-happy Ed Norton look-alike who just cannot think because of booze and substance. Add to them several stereotyped hooligans (loser type, macho-type, etc.) and you get the recipe for this unoriginal film. And add a role of a rich girl Heather (`unattainable' our young hero seems to think) and give it to Paris Hilton.

OK, now, this is what you are about to see next. Picture to yourself a swimming pool scene in which Paris Hilton shows up  in bikini briefly. Before or after that, throw in several unexciting shootings, and also some poor guy's funeral which Paris Hilton attends in sexy black dress. Occasionally the film needs some `funny' moments, so provide with laughs, use many F words, show some sketchy gags mostly based on stupid characters' repellent remarks on homosexuals and women. But perhaps we should take them as sarcasm, right?

I am sorry but I don't know anything about the director/writer/co-producer/co-casting director Saran Burnun. And probably there would be no occasion for me to know in the future. All I know is that `Hillz' is a really terrible film that I should have passed on last night.",1141689600,7,2132,4.702412868632708

2202787,2,B000777HY8,"Actually sitting down and watching a Paris Hilton film is about as wild and crazy as I get.  The Hillz really isn't a Paris Hilton film at all, though; it's just a film that she happens to appear in.  I don't think the Oscars are going to come calling at the Hilton estate any time soon.  The really sad thing is that everyone else in the cast is even a worse actor/actress than Paris.  I might mention the fact that Paris actually keeps her clothes on in this movie - although her funeral scene attire was a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen.

Oddly enough, this film could have been OK; all it needed was a decent writer, a decent director, a decent producer, a few decent actors, and some decent film quality.  Since The Hillz has none of those things, it basically does a complete cannonball into an empty swimming pool.  If I didn't know better, I would think Eminem wrote the script.  The Hillz is basically all about a group of white, nouveau riche, teenaged hooligans who embrace a life of crime.  In high school, they are just bored, no-good juvenile delinquents - and the cops are no better than they are.  After high school, though, every policeman within 100 miles of The Hillz obviously left town because Duff and his gang of hooligans and thugs beat people up, sell drugs, use drugs, and murder people in cold blood - in broad daylight.  There is apparently no community watch group in The Hillz because it's sort of hard for a whole neighborhood to not notice anything suspicious when a gang of kids cursing at the tops of their lungs start blowing each others' brains out in the middle of the street in the middle of the day.  Gorehounds, I must say, will be disappointed because we hardly see any blood whatsoever.  The characters themselves hardly even notice when Duff has one of his episodes and spontaneously takes somebody's head off - although one character does utter the words ""uncalled for"" in the wake of one of the murders.

There are trace elements of morality in this dark story.  A couple of the main characters walk away from the gang after the killing starts, only to be sucked back in (one way or another) before the credits roll.  The narrator is supposedly some guy who learned his lesson and is looking back on what happened to him, but he's just as dumb as Duff.  If this is some kind of morality tale, it's not a very good one.  The narrator guy happens to be madly in love with Heather Smith (Paris Hilton), even though she's self-centered and superficial (Paris wasn't exactly forced to act out of character for this film).  Paris doesn't really bring a lot to the actual story, but she (unlike her equally untalented co-stars) can generate sales.  When Paris Hilton is about the only thing going for a movie, you know it has some real problems.",1120780800,27,2791,4.5551102204408815

I found myself laughing thru-out this movie at its stupidity and marveled the idea of how the director, writers, and actors could possibly take themselves seriously! the plot is total nonsense...

4 up town rich brats don't like how some cops treat them, who should have been turned in in the 1st place, so they kill one of them...1st...most rich kids would have cried to mommy and daddy and gotton them involved...not taken matters into their own hands...and 2nd they wouldnt hang out in trashy neighborhoods...they stay at the country clubs and tennis courts. So then they just go on killing everyone they don't like...whatever. Paris Hilton, the only reason this movie is given a 2nd look, barely is in the movie and despite what people say, her acting isn't THAT bad...i mean yea shes no judy garland or halle berry...but honestly what do you expect...and she delivers well considering who she is.

i totaly wanted to shoot the tv when the ending happened! i was like NOOOO!! why the kid who had everything going for him! why that kid! sure get the pampered druggie stupid kid who didn't know what color he was but not the guy we actually kinda liked!! i was mad!

and yea the store owner...what the heck..ok so these kids steal from you all the time, and u still allow them in your store?? frankly you deserve to get robbed every time...its so stupid! ugh this is like top 5 worst movies EVER and if u disagree...wtf is wrong with you! yea true everyone is entitled to their own opinion...but this...this is totaly crap! stupid violence just there for the sake of being there, barely any sex scence and when u see them u find out one of the girls is a man...and its just stupid! id rather sit through ""valentine"" again than watch this again...",1113264000,8,2105,4.608
2202792,1,B000777HY8,"I rented this movie for a couple of reasons.  I LOVE Paris Hilton, and the lead guy in this movie was a guest star on the show Charmed.  I found out soon after the film started that Paris is barely in the movie at all, they just used her on the cover to get people to see it- good marketing.  The acting in this movie is about par with porn movies- it seems like in some of the scenes the actors had about one take to get it right.  The plot is also ridiculous.  These supposed High school boys kill a guy and don't even flinch- where is the human emotion that ususally comes with murder?  The main character has everything in the world going for him, but he makes the stupid mistake of hanging out with his loser drug-dealing friends anyway even though a person in his shoes would never do that- it is totally unbelievable.  This movie is so bad that it makes me not want to go to California ever again because of the way they dipict it.  I would recommend anything over this movie- Do Not See It!!!!",1113091200,5,1001,4.177083333333333
2202793,3,B000777HY8,"THE HILLZ producers say it's all about drug addiction, sex and violence but they should have taken it further. More creative violence that moves the plot forward in a logical way. It's not that hard when you get a writer who knows how to write. Paris is adorable as always and the only reason to see the film.

These other reviewers were obviously hired as gimps or gaffes during the production. The producers should have hired me to write the script and it would have hit theaters instead of straight to DVD. Script writers in Hollywood are retarded and/or scared to do even a single thing that's surprising.

This film isn't KIDS, but it does have Paris. Who is did I say it earlier -- fine as fukc. She needs me to write her a script, I'll make her into the film star she deserves to be since she's way finer than Tara Reid and all these other girls who can't even touch Paris.",1112227200,,880,4.359756097560975
