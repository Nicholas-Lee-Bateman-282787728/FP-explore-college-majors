4246199,4,B0041ONFHG,"For John Candy fans.  It's about time that some of John Candy's lesser titles were re-released.  For some reason the 3 titles included in this set were not listed.  They are:

1)  Delirious - a little known, nice John Candy Romantic Comedy Spoof with Muriel Hemmingway (it has been out of print for awhile).

2)  Space Balls - a Mel Brooks Space Adventure Spoof with John Candy & Rick Moranis.

3)  Canadian Bacon - a better than expected Michael Moore Political Spoof with John Candy, Alan Alda & Rhea Perlman.

If more detailed information is desired on the titles listed - please see them individually.",1286150400,7,605,4.6761904761904765

4246217,4,B0041ONFHG,"The three movies in this set are excellent.  If you're a fan of John Candy at all, you're sure to enjoy them all, but I wanted to review the DVD set itself.

Canadian Bacon and Delirious are on one two-sided disc, and Spaceballs in on the other.  CB and Delirious are both anamorphic widescreen, enhanced for widescreen TV's.  They look OK.  Not great, but certainly passable.  Spaceballs features the full-screen version on one side of the second disc and a widescreen version on the other.  For whatever reason, Spaceballs is non-anamorphic.  It looks decent enough when zoomed in, but it kind of sucks that the other 2 are enhanced and Spaceballs isn't.  I'm assuming that MGM is just dumping the old Spaceballs DVD into this package rather than do a new transfer.

I got this set for under $10, mainly for Canadian Bacon (which I believe is out of print as of this writing), so it's a good deal no matter how you look at it, and especially if you don't care about Spaceballs not being an anamorphic transfer.",1324425600,6,1012,4.603351955307263
4246218,3,B0041ONFHG,I purchased this DVD solely for Canadian Bacon.  The U.S. hawks are anxious to have another war and they pick Canada as the target.  Nobody gets killed.  Aspects of Canadian life are humorously ridiculed and the late Canadian actor John Candy plays the part of a redneck American.,1318032000,,280,4.791666666666667
