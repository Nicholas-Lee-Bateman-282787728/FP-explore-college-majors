1172989,4,9089707328,"I have been meaning to get a DVD for several years of a crackling fire. This year I finally did. Liked the winter
Scenes, crackling fire and candles the best with or without music. Would like to look into other DVDs like
Ocean waves/sounds and maybe others.",1387843200,5,257,4.48936170212766
1172990,5,9089707328,"I was thrilled to have this new two disc set from Isis Visuals in time for the holidays.  I have a lot nature films by this producer and have never been disappointed.  I was sad to see another reviewer here was not happy with the disc.  I would bet that the producers would let you trade it for an alternate title to see if it meets your expectations.

I hope my description will help potential buyers make an informed choice - and check out free clips of scenes at their website, [...] or Vimo or YouTube.  The first disc is a Christmas specific disc, and the second is called winter wonderland.  There is something for every holiday mood here!

The Christmas disc has a main film that is busy with sounds of the city, shots of decorations, lights, a nativity, and even city traffic through a decorated area during the holidays.  The music changes from slow to mid beat tempos, and while it is not my ideal, it was great background while I wrapped presets and took care of holiday shipping needs.  It helped me get into the spirit for these mundane tasks.

I also like that this disc has a fireworks film, which is just the sounds of fireworks in the sky and a lovely light show.  I can see having this on as background for New Years Eve or any other celebratory party.

There is a nice fireplace selection too, and it has the option to have two different types of holiday music or just fireplace sounds.  I prefer the more traditional track of music on this one, while the other is more upbeat.

If that wasn't enough, there is a separate candle film, with panning shots of a solitary lit candle, transitioning to multiple candles and even a bowl of candles floating on water.  This film has Christmas music set to it, and is another comforting scene to have as background while having family time during the holidays.

A couple of decoration scenes are also included, another of candles, an icy creek scene with upbeat music (not my favorite), and a shot of gently rippling water with glitter spots of light appearing on the surface.  This one is very tranquil, and may be reflections from ice on overhanging trees.

I no longer live in a snowy area, and I do miss the beauty of the snow, but don't miss the horrific driving conditions that come with it.  The Winter Wonderland disc has a film set to Christmas music all with wintry outdoors scenes.  There are also six stand alone scenes to choose, each with various wintry places to enjoy apart from the main film, such as two versions of an icy creek, an pine tree laden with snow, a canyon scene, and two other wonderful selections.  I often choose these scenes more frequently than  the main films on other titles from this producer as they are so nicely done.

Most of these have a nice classical music background, and my favorite is the close up of the pin tree covered with snow.  The snow has been on the tree long enough for it to stick to each individual needle and shows a gorgeous pattern.  The background on this one has no music, but the icy wind of the snow falling that makes this a delightful chilly scene to enjoy from the warmth of your home.  I like the icy creek one for the same reason, the natural sounds set to the snow bluster and the water sounds of the flow.  The classical music is nice too.

I will include this set as part of my holiday preparation and celebration for years to come!",1387670400,14,3367,4.422077922077922
1172991,1,9089707328,I am returning this video and will not buy any others from this company as they have put out a very poor product. I cannot believe other reviewer gave it excellent rating. The scenes are nothing special and in fact ugly. I keep thinking of all the beautiful Christmas sites in Manhattan and elsewhere that could have been used. I am returning it. Deserves no star.,1387584000,4,364,4.53030303030303
1172992,5,9089707328,"This set of DVD's is everything you need for Xmas. We used both while decorating the house and there was no need for extra music either. A really good selection of fires, candles, busy streets and outdoorsy footage. I like the fact that each film is separated so on my DVD player I was able to loop fire and outdoor scenes as well. Fabulous quality as well. Love it.",1386460800,5,366,4.318840579710145
7901573,3,9089707328,"It's pretty hokey. The music quality is not very good. Some video of a Christmas tree seems to have been shot in a shopping mall (one can see people walking by in the reflection on the tree ornaments). The winter scenes feel very cold and uninviting.
There is very little on the DVD that I am using. It's ok, but a bit pricey.",1513468800,,326,4.190476190476191
7901574,5,9089707328,Just waiting for Christmas to use this video.,1474502400,,45,4.75
7901575,1,9089707328,"This is a rip off DVD.  I have other DVDs from Helsloot, and this is not one his best efforts.  In fact, some of the scenes are clips from his other DVDs, including mountain scenery.  The ""Winter Christmas"" scenes on this disc are just extended views of pine trees, creeks and snow.  There is no creativity at all, such as lovely scenes of snowy roads or trails with beautiful trees and/or quaintly decorated houses along the way, such as in Vermont in the winter time, where you can imagine a cozy sleigh ride in the snow on a lovely Christmas evening.  The other clips are decorations, a stuffed Santa Clause and a candle or fireworks.  No imagination at all.  An excellent example of a talented photographer with no vision or creativity taking advantage of people who are seeking exactly that at Christmas time..  A waste of money.",1449100800,,834,4.625850340136054

7901577,5,9089707328,Another favorite of the seasons of DVD's  from this producer. Photography was simply amazing. Would order future videos again.,1445817600,,126,5.631578947368421
7901578,5,9089707328,Extremely happy with this collection.  packaged very well.,1422921600,,58,6.25
7901579,4,9089707328,"I have read mixed reviews of this DVD.  What I found is beauty is in the eye of the beholder. In this case, whether you will like this DVD will be determined by what you are looking for.  I watched this straight through for three hours and I would never do that again!  What I would do with the first DVD which is entitled, Christmas, is have it play in the background while putting up the tree or if I had company and I just wanted something on the TV screen, I would play it.  The Christmas Decorations at the beginning of the DVD are what I would describe as Modern European.

The second part of the first DVD is a nice crackling fire in a fireplace with your choice of 3 different music/sound backgrounds.  The first selection is very nice classical music.  The second is Christmas music with fire burning sounds and the third just the fire crackling.  Since I was sitting right next to my own crackling fireplace, this did not interest me BUT if I did not have a fireplace and was looking for a DVD of this sort, then this would be perfect.  It was great having the three sound choices because you could play it other than at Christmas time.

Next was a section with fireworks.  I think this would be perfect for New Years Eve Party.

Then there was a selection of burning candles (not my thing).

If you have read any of my other reviews, I am more into the relaxation DVDS from the Ambient Collection.  This is where the second DVD called Snow and Winter Wonderland comes in.  There again, watching it right after watching the other DVD, I was Christmased out and didn't appreciate the Christmas music at the beginning of the DVD but about half way through when the music changed, it was perfect  nice relaxing and just what I love! Watching it a second time without having watched the first DVD- I appreciated it so much more.  The HD quality of the winter scenes was very good.  Watching the snow in the warmth of my home was very enjoyable.  I have snow where I live but I think don't always get to enjoy the nature scenes that are presented on this DVD AND if you don't live in snow country  you will probably enjoy this even more.  It definitely gets you into the mood of the winter season.

Having said all that, there is a lot to choose from with these two DVDs (about 200 minutes worth!) and I think there will be something on it to please everyone.  I did receive this DVD at no cost in exchange for my honest review.",1421020800,,2433,4.31057268722467
7901580,3,9089707328,It wasn't what I thought it would be. I was almost boring because it stayed on scenes too long. Put it on while we were unwrapping presents and they asked me to turn it off because it was putting them to sleep.,1421020800,,210,4.023809523809524
7901581,3,9089707328,"Love the video, but the sound is distorted and must turn the sound off to enjoy the ambiance of the videos.  I use it for a gathering of people who want to talk and don't require the sound so it's okay.  The snow falling and the fireplace are perfect all winter long.",1420848000,,267,4.115384615384615
7901582,4,9089707328,"This video is more than advertised. It contains loops of winter scenes, fireworks, Christmas ornaments, and others. The reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 stars is because of the audio on the disk which is sub par. I did not need the sound, so the video was perfect for me, but if you really want the audio to go with the beautiful scenes, then turn off the sound and turn on your stereo with the holiday music to go with this video.",1388534400,13,438,4.104651162790698
