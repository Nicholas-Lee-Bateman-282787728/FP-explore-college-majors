589442,4,6303184170,"Albert is a street singer, selling songs on a Parisian street, when he notices Pola, shyly singing along with the crowd.  Later, at a bar/dance hall with his friend Louis, Albert again sees Pola sitting by herslef.  He and Louis roll the dice to see who gets to talk to her, but even though Albert wins, he stops short when he sees Pola with her gangster boyfriend, Fred.  Through a series of events, both planned and unplanned, Albert tries to woo Pola, but winds up in jail and then gets involved in a street fight with Fred's gang.
This is a charming film from Ren Clair.  It was filmed just as movies with sound were beginning to appear so it has a unique style in that there is very little dialogue.  Most of the action is acted like a silent movie with music to enhance the action.  But, in a unique twist for its time, the characters do speak and sing, but only when necessary.  It's a mix between the two genres: silent and talkies.  A great little film.
The DVD is a clean, crisp transfer with some camera shaking, problably from the original direction.  It also includes the original opening to the film, which Clair editied out in 1950, and his first silent film ""Paris qui dort (Paris Asleep)"" which makes for a very ineteresting early sci-fi film.",1059091200,,1260,4.467248908296943
589443,3,6303184170,"Rene Clair's 1930 SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS, a mostly-mimed musical, is about about two pals -- Albert and Louis -- who make a wager in the rain ""under a Paris roof"" (hence the title) to see who will go with pretty Pola. But alas she goes off with Fred!  A series of complications way too complex to detail here ensue as the four characters mix and match until one is left alone singing in the rain on a Paris street.
This film, made silent and then dubbed with French dialog and music, is done with grace and charm in spite its melodramatic plot. Albert's calm detachment seems to insulate him from all danger and sorrow, while Fred seems to get away with numerous nefarious deeds.  I liked this film and its dreamlike images and poetic story.",1043884800,4,742,4.408759124087592
589444,5,6303184170,"A heartbreaking, beautiful portrait of urban life in the City of Love.  This was director Rene Clair's first sound film, built around the concept of following a street musician through his daily life.  Clair uses the occasion to play with the concept of sound recording: many dramatic scenes are played out silently, while an entire apartment building softly hums the catchy tune sung by chanteur Albert Prejean; in the film's climactic scene, a record on the stereo begins to skip as rival suitors quarrel over the Roumanian belle, Pola Illery.  The sound design is as playful as it is inventive, and Clair's command of image and editing is superb.  Fans of French ""musette"" music owe it to themselves to check out this film, which skillfully depicts the nightlife inside one of a Parisian bal musette dancehall, populated as it was by seedy ruffians and disheartened lovers.  A wonderful film; highly recommended. (DJ Joe Sixpack)",1039737600,2,932,5.025974025974026
589445,5,6303184170,"Rene Clair's first sound film contains innovative cinematic devices that have since become commonplace (but which still retain most of their poetry in this context).  A useful tonic for anyone who believes that sound was the death of true cinema, _Under the Roofs of Paris_ shows that even in the clunky early days of sound technology, there were directors who could use it with the freedom and expressiveness found in the best silent films.
Criterion has performed a loving restoration of this French classic, and included a few very nice extras (including an informative television interview and Clair's early short ""Paris qui dort"").  It's a classic.",1032825600,2,653,5.150943396226415
589446,4,6303184170,"This is a film from the transitional period between silents and sound. The film was shot without sound, then later dubbed. The result is a movie that is predominantly visual and this assists greatly if you have bought the V.H.S. version, because the subtitles are all over the place. Some dialogue has no subtitles whatsoever, some has titles for part of a conversation, and (maddeningly!) other parts have a subtitle half or even a quarter visible at the bottom of the screen. This is not the fault of Rene Clair however, who presents us with some great images of the streets of Paris, its low-life, and a peek inside the rented rooms of the poor people. The sound too is pretty good when you consider its original format, and the pretty but simple music conveys Clair's own enthusiasm to the listener.
The plot is somewhat incidental, but difficult to follow since it seems two near-identical men dressed in almost the same clothes are rolling dice to see who gets a girl. They are thwarted by a tough Parisian thief who looks uncannily like Basil Fawlty! But this does not really matter, just look at the sights and sounds of 1920s Paris, lovingly recreated in the film studio and see why Clair went on to become such a successful Hollywood director.",1004486400,5,1253,4.7
589447,5,6303184170,I saw this film in the cinema (=movie house) in the 1940's. My chief reccollection is the haunting title song and this was my chief reason for ordering it. How unfortunate that it is an USA vhs format,1000166400,2,200,4.2894736842105265

7840236,4,6303184170,"I think when the Farrelly Brothers made ""There's Something about Mary,"" or when Woody Allen shot Paris at night while making ""Midnight in Paris,"" those American directors must have had this French cinematic gem in mind. ""Under the Roofs of Paris"" is an early ""talkie"" with exceptional performances from Albert Prejean and the sexy Romanian actress Pola, who plays Pola.

There's something about Pola! Every French gangster and never-do-well wants her. But the problem is Pola brings trouble with her, and that's what Albert finds out in this comedy-drama. I think fans of classic cinema will really enjoy this beautiful snapshot of what Paris must have been like about 100 years ago.",1423872000,,683,5.098214285714286
7840237,4,6303184170,"UNDER THE ROOFS OF PARIS, (SOUS LES TOITS DE PARIS) (1930) was the first talking movie of Ren  Clair, beloved director of many French classics.  In this black and white romantic comedy/drama, almost more a musical than a talkie, the director, who also wrote the script treatment, gives us a memorable, evocative portrait of the crowded tenements of Paris.  The film is often described as a picture of Parisian working class life; yet, as no major character in it has a job, it is more appropriately considered a portrait of the Parisian proletariat, or even the lumpenproletariat.

Here, Albert, played by Albert Prjean , a street singer, and Bill, a gangster played by Bill Bocket,  vie for the love of Pola, played by Pola Illry, a beautiful young Rumanian good time girl. This witty exploration of love and human foibles, told primarily through song, captures the contemporaneous flamboyant magical atmosphere of the City of Light with sophisticated visuals and groundbreaking use of  new movie sound technology. The film was an international sensation upon its release. It stands as an exhilarating exploration of the art and craft of filmmaking, one of France's most popular cinematic exports, which is said to have influenced such later outstanding directors as Charlie Chaplin, Ernst Lubitsch and Rouben Mamoulian.  Of the latter influence, there can be no doubt: the opening montage of Mamoulian's LOVE ME TONIGHT, a glorious compendium of Parisian early morning street scenes, is unimaginable without Clair's monumental earlier picture.  Worth a look.",1403395200,,1560,5.236947791164659
7840238,5,6303184170,"Under the Roofs of Paris is one of the great achievements of early French and World Cinema.  There is no disputing that Claire was one of the top four or five masters of French Cinema, right from the beginning, and takes his place among luminaries such as Jean Renoir, Francois Truffaut, and others.  Under the Roofs of Paris is probably THE classic Rene Claire film and holds-up better than some, going into a new century.  Rene Claire did relatively little work in the United States and didn't really fit well into the classic Hollywood Studio System.  I recall that he only made about four English language films for Hollywood, probably the most significant of those being Flame of New Orleans with Marlene Dietrich,  But Claire, like Charles Chaplin was really grounded in and did his most significant work in the silent cinema.  Under the Roofs of Paris is a simple story, well told, of a Parisian small time street hustler and sometimes shady but good hearted survivor and his derailed love for an innocent Parisian girl.  This was a transitional film that really is a silent film with added sound and some dialogue, but still, stylistically, SILENT.  In that respect it is somewhat like Eric Von Stroheim's ""The Great Gabbo"", and reminds one of that scenario and filming style with still primitive sound recording equipment.  But despite its vintage, there is no doubt that this is one of Rene Claire's masterpieces and its a great introduction to not only film history, but as a good starting point in learning to appreciate French Cinema.  The DVD features a very unique EXTRA in that it includes a historical on-camera interview with Rene Claire discussing his work.
While Criterion DVD's are always the ""Gold Standard"" of classic cinema reproduction, this particular film appears to not be fully restored and the transfer print shows some wear, but this may be due to the lack of existence of a usable original negative or the original French printing elements that, after more than seventy years, have probably deteriorated.",1364169600,,2036,4.926900584795321
7840239,5,6303184170,"In 1930, movies with sound were still a relative novelty, and while American films of that era (""The Jazz Singer"", etc.) mostly tried to outdo each other with being as loud and shrill as possible and the music was center stage, the French did a film that is tasteful and restrained in its use of sound, and sometimes even reverts back to silent film, perhaps only to remind us to savor the next time sound appears. Why am I not surprised?

I already knew the chanson that is also the main theme of the movie (and in fact one of the little jokes in the film involves panning around an apartment house only to find no one can get that ditty out of their heads, to the chagrin of some of the other tenants), so I was naturally interested to see if the movie it came from was any good. And it is. Ren&eacute; Clair knows that his plot is banal, but then again so they are in most other movies, so this is an exercise in mood, camera movement and how the story is told. And his restraint is what makes the film seem fresh even today -- too many movies from the 1930s, whether they are American screwball comedies or French films like those of Jean Renoir have a tendency to go overboard, often in ways that make the movie somewhat painful to watch today for being so over-the-top, ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" The wisdom of Clair is turning a small, intimate story into a small, intimate movie. He is utterly unpretentious, something else modern filmmakers might take note of. The film is impressive because it does not try too hard to impress.

Perhaps the best way to sum this movie is to say this is is a picture which sound, which all the time extolls the virtue of silence. For example, in the dance hall, when the singer and his friend share a broken cigarette the dance music is basically noise (and makes conversation impossible). If the main technical innovation of a film you are making is sound, then pointing out all the time in your film how superfluous (and perhaps even annoying) it really is, how it really just stands in the way of things that are really important is certainly quite bold. There has probably never been a sound picture that has made a more convincing case that films (and perhaps even life itself) might be more enjoyable without sound!

Watching this definitely benefits from a feel for what Europe in the 1930s might have been like, particularly since the movie is relatively stylized and studio-bound. Other good films about life between Berlin and Paris at that time include&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Berlin-Symphony-of-a-Great-City/dp/6305301697/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Berlin: Symphony of a Great City</a>&nbsp;and Carn&eacute;'s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Port-of-Shadows-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00026L74U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Port of Shadows - Criterion Collection</a>.",1194480000,4,2930,5.177215189873418
7840240,5,6303184170,"This lustrous early sound film by Rene Clair tells of a love triangle in the City of Lights, using the 1930s-era streets (and yes, rooftops) of Paris as its sublimely visual backdrop. From the swooping opening shot and shadowy nighttime fight sequence to his only occasional use of dialogue and music, Clair treats all aspects of the medium with equal respect, relying heavily on cinematographer Georges Perinal and production designer Lazare Meerson for the evocative look of his film. I've no doubt the stylish, exhilarating ""Paris"" will weave its love spell on you.",1182384000,3,568,5.118279569892473
7840241,3,6303184170,"During the '30s, Ren Clair was considered one of the cinema's most stylish innovators and satirists... Now, however, both the 'poetic realism' and the exuberant humor on which his reputation once rested seem shallow and dated...

A critic, and a poet and actor in the serials of Louis Feuillade, the young Clair aligned himself with the French avant-garde of the '20s... Indeed, his silent work may be seen as offshoots of the Dada movement: his debut, ""Paris Qui Dort"" (""The Crazy Ray""), was a bizarre comic fantasy in which a mad scientist uses a magic ray to render the city immobile; only a group of strangers, safe atop the Eiffel Tower or in a plane, remain conscious to search for the culprit and bring Paris back to life...",1168387200,,731,4.7109375

Along his fruitful career, Clair developed and always bet for the best of the mankind. His depictions possesses that naive glance surrounded by a magical spell.

7840243,3,6303184170,"I feel a little odd reviewing this movie. I seem to be in complete contrast to what other have to say about this movie. I was left somewhat disappointed.

 I have only seen two previous films by French filmmaker Rene Clair. I saw ""I Married A Witch"" and ""Le Million"" (So far this is my favorite). So I have nothing against Clair's work. In fact I would say I already consider myself a fan. His work reminds me of the American slapstick comedies being made by Chaplin or Lloyd. And ""Under the Roofs of Paris"" as pointed out by other reviewers was Clair's first talking film. Though just as in Chaplin's first sound films ""City Lights"" and ""Modern Times"" dialogue is kept at a minimal. Much of the film has background music and when actors speak the music stops. The action of the film is always set to music. In fact ""Under the Roofs of Paris"" could have worked as a silent film. But I just didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did ""Le Million"" and the reason for that is the story. ""Under the Roofs of Paris"" has a flimsy story-line. The movie hangs by a very slim thread.

 The movie has something to do with two men; Albert (Albert Prejean) and Louis (Edward Greville) falling in love with Pola (Pola Illery), some sort of story going on with a robbery (That is never shown on-screen) involving Bill (Bill Bocket) and Fred (Gaston Mobot). The problem with the film is Pola, who goes from one man to the next. I questioned whether she loved either of them. Or if she was capable to love at all. I didn't understand her character. How she was able to switch so fast from Albert to Louis is beyond me. And they say men are fickle! The other problem has to do with this robbery. Because we never see it on screen we don't know what's going on. Who did they steal it from? Why are the police involved? Was it from some rich family? And why exactly are Albert and Bill friends to begin with. But maybe I'm asking all the wrong questions. Maybe we are not suppose to think when watching this movie. Maybe we are just suppose to sit back and look at it. Well, if we do that ""Under the Roofs of Paris"" has something to be desired. It has a wonderful look. Much of this DVD transfer that I saw had a crisp clear look. The cinematography is beautiful. And the whole story-line was probably just a lark for Clair. But again, I just felt the movie didn't have the silliness of ""Le Million"", which had a much better story.

 Also on this DVD is Clair's first film ""Paris Sleeps"" a 20 minute short that at first is quite funny but then goes on a bit too long. Not much happens.

 Bottom-line: A confusing story that doesn't explain much and jumps from one situation to the next. The character Pola is a disappointment because she doesn't seem realistic. Has a wonderful look and at times is enjoyable, especially in the beginning.",1115164800,,2817,4.352380952380952
7840244,5,6303184170,"It is amazing how quickly some directors mastered sound film almost immediately.  Both Ernst Lubitsch in Hollywood and Rene Clair in France adapted to the sound film apparently without effort, and produced some of the earliest masterpieces in their respected countries.  Their strategies, however, differed slightly.  While Lubitsch employed microphones from beginning to end, Clair, much like Hitchcock in Great Britain with his earliest sound features, blended silent and sound techniques.  In UNDER THE ROOFS OF PARIS, Clair has essentially produced a silent film with numerous talking sequences, usually relatively static scenes with conversation and singing.  The reason for this was primarily the incapacity of the earliest microphones to accommodate much music.  Clair is so masterful in his use of the camera, however, that he makes a virtue out of necessity, and one can only notice the silent nature of much of the film if one looks for it.
Anyone familiar with the work of Andrew Sarris knows that Clair, like Lubitsch and Hitchcock, is placed in his ""Pantheon' of the greatest auteurs in the history of film, and one can easily believe it watching this remarkable film.  While many early sound directors saw sound as a gimmick, Clair saw it as an opportunity to expand the capacity of film to tell a story.
The story is not like anything that would have been told in Hollywood.  The story is boy meets girl, boy kinda gets girl, boy loses girl, and the girl stays lost.  A note of danger and sadness underscores the entire movie, despite the sharp humor and song.  Albert, a young man who makes his living by selling sheet music in the street, falls deeply in love with Pola, whom he rescues from a petty gangster.  While in jail, his best friend befriends Pola, and she falls in love with him.  The contrast between Albert, who loves with great constancy, and Pola, who throws her affection from the gangster to Albert to his friend Louis with little or not transition, could not be greater.  In the end, while one regrets for Albert's sake that he does not end up with the girl he loves, one cannot help but think that he can do better.  Interestingly, Albert is played by Albert Prjean and Pola, who is supposed to be Romanian, is played by Pola Illry, who was indeed Romanian.
I can't stress enough how enjoyable this film is.  Seventy-four years later, the viewer doesn't have to cut this film the tiniest bit of slack to love it.  It isn't an artifact, but a vibrant, adorable excursion into the Parisian underworld of 1930.  It was not merely one of the first great French sound films made, but one of the great musicals of all time.",1085356800,8,2652,4.780701754385965
