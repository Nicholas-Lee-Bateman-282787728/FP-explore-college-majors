8655212,5,6301882342,"This is ""Vintage Gill"" at his best! Energy and innocence
 abounds! I enjoyed this collection of videos, interviews and concert footage immensley! This man is truly talented and makes what looks like grueling routines  look effortless! He handles himself as if his showmanship is innate, which proves the fact that his ablities were cultivated at a young age. My younger sons are 7 and 11 and they were very impressed with his voice and dancing prowess, that which they tried to duplicate to no avail! We know that this tape was made a while back but to this day Johnny Gill still gives a ""loving ""performance and I consider our family fortunate to have our Johnny Gill time capsule.  Thank you
