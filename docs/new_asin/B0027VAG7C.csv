8355126,5,B0027VAG7C,"This is my second Rob Hood (R.I.P.) video I have purchased. The first, Survival Basics I & II (5 stars) was purchased here. I picked up this copy at Survival Tactics in Reynoldsburg Ohio for more than listed on Amazon, but it was an impulse buy based on the first purchase. I will be ordering many more from here soon.
This title is a little misleading, as it is shot in his house and he is teaching crafts for tools you will use in the field.
Ron is a very fun person to watch. He is a no BS, no superhero type of guy. He will not edit out mistakes, but laugh at them and make you see how to fix them. His leasons are like listening to an old friend explain to you what to do over a beer.
This video is all about using Kydex plastic for sheath molds and leather cases and gloves. You do not need a workshop for this. He does it all in his basement with simple tools. The concepts of measuring and use of patterns is shown and easily understood. I am looking forward to a dozen other projects that this video made me think of and I now feel confident I can do.
THANK YOU WOODMASTER !!",1327968000,,1084,4.046511627906977
