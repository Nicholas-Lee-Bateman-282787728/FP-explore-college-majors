5018293,5,B006U1S99M,"I recently purchased The Amazing Bulk for a good laugh.

Little did I realize that I was to bear witness to the greatest film, nay- The greatest expression of human achievement that this feeble earth has ever known.

From the jaw dropping special effects, to the heart-Wrenching love story, and with a couple gut-busting laughs here and there, Steven Spielberg might as well just quit making movies.

In fact, we may never need another movie ever again.",1362441600,19,453,4.857142857142857
5018294,1,B006U1S99M,"My son and I seek out the lowest rated movies as a test of enduring the pain to watch as well as a test of creative verbiage to mock.  This fits well into that realm.  Filmed completely with ""green screen"" this film is a ""MUST SEE"" to completely ruin your day.... unless you take upon yourself the challenge ""to endure... and to mock"".  WARNING; you will need a very low sense of good humor that is unbecoming of the intelligence required to articulate the full level of mockability for this mockbuster.  If that is your intent then go for broke... as you may actually break watching it.  We compare this to Brett Kelly (producer) films... if you like them then you will like ""The Amazing Bulk"".",1360713600,4,695,4.484126984126984

Everything is so... bad, you have to wonder just how hard they worked to make it look so bad.  I can imagine them filming.  ""No, you're not running in place badly enough.  Hey, can we make the backgrounds look more cartoony?  Phil, what's the WORST sound editing software you can find?""

5018297,5,B006U1S99M,"First off you may be surprised to find out, but there is some green screen usage in this movie. This movie was made... by drugs, on drugs with a mix of alcohol. The script makes no sense, the CGI is soo bad that it's amazing, and it's only funny when it tries to be serious. If you are a fan of Birdemic, you will be amazed. Some the amazing CGI/Scenes this movie includes:

.Gifs, Cartoon backgrounds, bad explosions, killer smart cars, Comic Sans, lightning, skeletons, stock missile footage, stock NASA footage, running in place, walking place, British phone booths (in america), a naked giant purple mentally disabled Michael Chicklas, SCIENCE!, microscopes, an encyclopedia, police cars, a Canon EOS Rebel, an ambulance, beakers, a scientist trying to feed a giant bone to a rat that explodes into mist, butterflies, the Nasalnex Bee, more SCIENCE!, a space fountain, an Army General with erectile dysfunction that has paranoid delusions of dust and spies in his personal library, a GIANT moving wine cellar, bats, a castle that is half modern and half umm castle, a black guy, a dog that is soo badly animated that makes the Dogz from the 1990's look nex-gen, a monkey with a rocket in a control room that is never addressed while Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky writes and plays music on a monitor in the background, exploding monuments, a subway car that shakes, randomly appearing muggers, a car that can achieve light speed, a table possessed by a lazy poltergeist, 3 stooges, transitions that would make George Lucas climax, a police car that was drawn by MS Paint that has a couch for seats, flying cars, the laws of physics are broken, a Toyota Previa(s), the Lincoln Memorial, people walking, a ""TOP SECRET GOVERNMENT FACILITY,"" the Hulk hand toy spray painted purple, satellite sex, midget rooms, flight of the Valkeryies, a monkey in a rocket, a golf course, a leprechaun with a pot of gold, a giant boulder, a terrible family guy reference, a green NBA player with a torch, fire, robin hood, a wallaby and a koala and a boomerang, flamingos, a jet, a bull, a horse, a tank, WWII planes, anthropomorphic animals on a swingset, a see saw, the geico gecko typing, a biplane, a pirate ship, a super hero, Zeus attacking people, people who don't care about explosions, a submarine, a disturbing pug that can fly, a man riding an atom bomb that explodes in to mushroomcloud.gif, a dead pug going to heaven, and a man peeing on a grave.

5018298,1,B006U1S99M,"I suspect, like they did in the IMDB, people who worked on this little video will be invading this section with fake reviews, essentially calling this the next ""Citizen Kane."" You'd think by the title was a spoof on the Hulk but it's actually not. It's just a poorly made (and saying ""poorly made"" doesn't do the phrase justice) rip off of the Hulk, entirely shot on green screen with CGI from 1992. I assume they thought it was kind of like a comic book but the backgrounds were created by a six year old. There isn't anyone who can remotely act in this turd - and sadly, it's not even good as one of those ""so bad it's good"" type films. It's just bad. And when I say bad CGI, I do not exaggerate. I sincerely believe the 11 year old who did the CGI for this thing got the software off some freeware site on the internet. There isn't anything remotely entertaining about this pile of garbage.

5018769,1,B006U1S99M,"If you're a fan of bad movies, The Amazing Bulk is a must. I mean, this one is PAINFUL.

The entire movie is filmed against a blue screen. Instead of walking, characters shuffle in place while the background scrolls past them like a low-budget Hanna-Barbera cartoon. Instead of an actual patrol car, two detectives sit on a couch and a windshield is drawn around them, apparently using MS Paint. Not a single frame of action is shot in the real world.

Well, that's not entirely accurate. At least twice during the movie, the viewer is regaled with long, pointless sequences of stock footage showing various world landmarks being hit by cartoon missiles, all to the tune of the Blue Danube Waltz and other pieces of music from the public domain.

And then there is the Amazing Bulk himself. When a frustrated, blubbering scientist decides to test a super-soldier serum on himself, he turns into a huge, paunchy, purple man and lumbers about the city--stark naked. It's a bit like watching an anatomically-correct Grimace run wind sprints.

The only thing that might diminish your enjoyment of this unapologetically bad movie is the fact that it was obviously made to be bad on purpose. I can't say for sure, but this kind of feels like some college students' animation project--like maybe they were experimenting with blue screen techniques and basic (REALLY basic) computer animation and, realizing this movie wasn't going to win any Oscars, decided to have some fun with it. That's the only explanation I can think of that makes any sense.

Totally worth watching if you're fascinated by bad movies, but I definitely recommend having several friends over for the screening--you're going to need the moral support to get through this one.",1454630400,12,1739,4.941780821917808

5019117,1,B006U1S99M,"This is the worst movie ever made.

Now don't get me wrong -- there are terrible movies that are more of a chore to watch (""Manos, The Hands Of Fate""), or which are more notoriously bad (""The Room,"" ""Birdemic""). But I have never seen one which showed such a glorious lack of understanding of the moviemaking process -- ""The Amazing Bulk,"" where every single thing that can be done in a movie... is gloriously, hilariously WRONG.

It follows Henry ""Hank"" Howard (Jordan Lawson), a mild-mannered scientist coming up with some kind of Captain America serum for the military. He's also in love with Hannah (Shevaun Kastl), the daughter of his insane boss General Darwin (Terence Lording). When Darwin shoots down his hopes for marrying Hannah, Hank decides to test the latest serum sample on himself... because he's an idiot.

Then he transforms into the Amazing Bulk... which is like the Incredible Hulk, but purple. And not scary. And he sort of awkwardly mince-jogs everywhere.

That night, Hank-Bulk attacks and kills... somehow... a mugger who had stolen the engagement ring he was going to give Hannah. This attracts the attention of a pair of incompetent police detectives, and ultimately puts him in the hands of grinning madman General Darwin. Also a sexually impotent supervillain called Dr. Kantlove is somehow involved.

""The Amazing Bulk"" gets everything wrong. EVERYTHING. If I examined every single thing this movie does wrong, I would be reviewing it for the rest of my natural life. In fact, I often had to stop watching and wonder if this was one of the rare, rare movies that TRIES to be so-bad-it's-good. It seems unlikely that any human being who has ever actually seen a movie -- any movie -- would think this was acceptable.

How bad is it? Well, consider this: ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has competent camerawork. ""The Room"" has a few moments of passable acting. ""Troll 2"" at least has special effects that don't make you want to laugh until you pee. You can normally find ONE thing competently done in even the worst movies... but not this one. The acting. The special effects. The continuity. The jokes. The writing. The climax. Even the credits are awful -- someone decided to make them Comic Sans. Who has credits in Comic Sans?!

But the most notable problem is HOW it's filmed -- everything is filmed in front of a greenscreen ... which is apparently the size of a bedsheet, since the actors are not allowed to actually move. When their characters have to walk, run or frolic, they just awkwardly jog in place and pose, or float through a CGI hallway that moves slightly too fast.

And don't forget the writing (Darwin's rant about dust armies taking over his house) and spectacularly awful climax, which is basically a parade of every single unrelated stock image that director Lewis Schoenbrun could get his hands on. Leprechauns. Koalas. Robin Hood. Zeus. It's almost hypnotic how little sense this makes.

Here's another example: the scale issues. The Bulk literally changes size from scene to scene -- sometimes he's slightly larger than a human, and sometimes he's the size of Godzilla. No explanation. And he's not the only problem -- one hilarious scene has a woman being crushed to death under a very, very tiny car. A car too small for hobbits. Let that sink in.

In fact, you almost forget that this is a naked ripoff of ""The Incredible Hulk."" It doesn't matter. Nothing matters except the hypnotic parade of hilarious ineptitude that just keeps scrolling by.

The bad acting is just the cherry on the sundae. Lawson has his face locked in perpetual pre-crying whiny-face, apparently because he doesn't know what depression, sorrow or angst look like. Lording plays everything with grinning scenery-chewing insanity, Randal Malone plays a bargain-price Dr. Evil in a bad wig, and Jed Rowen acts like he's trying to spawn a meme with every line. EVERY. LINE.

""The Amazing Bulk"" is one of those rare, special movies that exists solely for people to riff on -- and in terms of technical ability, it is THE WORST. I have literally seen no-budget Internet shows with better production values... and that steady stream of jaw-dropping wretchedness is why everyone should see it.

In fact, I often had to stop watching and wonder if this was one of the rare, rare movies that TRIES to be so-bad-it's-good. It seems unlikely that any human being who has ever actually seen a movie -- any movie -- would think this was acceptable.

How bad is it? Well, consider this: ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has competent camerawork. ""The Room"" has a few moments of passable acting. ""Troll 2"" at least has special effects that don't make you want to laugh until you pee. You can normally find ONE thing competently done in even the worst movies... but not this one. The acting. The special effects. The continuity. The jokes. The writing. The climax. Even the credits are awful -- someone decided to make them Comic Sans. Who has credits in Comic Sans?!

But the most notable problem is HOW it's filmed -- everything is filmed in front of a greenscreen ... which is apparently the size of a bedsheet, since the actors are not allowed to actually move. When their characters have to walk, run or frolic, they just awkwardly jog in place and pose, or float through a CGI hallway that moves slightly too fast.

And don't forget the writing (Darwin's rant about dust armies taking over his house) and spectacularly awful climax, which is basically a parade of every single unrelated stock image that director Lewis Schoenbrun could get his hands on. Leprechauns. Koalas. Robin Hood. Zeus. It's almost hypnotic how little sense this makes.

Here's another example: the scale issues. The Bulk literally changes size from scene to scene -- sometimes he's slightly larger than a human, and sometimes he's the size of Godzilla. No explanation. And he's not the only problem -- one hilarious scene has a woman being crushed to death under a very, very tiny car. A car too small for hobbits. Let that sink in.

In fact, you almost forget that this is a naked ripoff of ""The Incredible Hulk."" It doesn't matter. Nothing matters except the hypnotic parade of hilarious ineptitude that just keeps scrolling by.

The bad acting is just the cherry on the sundae. Lawson has his face locked in perpetual pre-crying whiny-face, apparently because he doesn't know what depression, sorrow or angst look like. Lording plays everything with grinning scenery-chewing insanity, Randal Malone plays a bargain-price Dr. Evil in a bad wig, and Jed Rowen acts like he's trying to spawn a meme with every line. EVERY. LINE.

""The Amazing Bulk"" is one of those rare, special movies that exists solely for people to riff on -- and in terms of technical ability, it is THE WORST. I have literally seen no-budget Internet shows with better production values... and that steady stream of jaw-dropping wretchedness is why everyone should see it. It literally must be seen to believed.",1393545600,16,4248,4.868421052631579

If you are thinking about how bad this movie is based on that tagline alone, you're not thinking hard enough...The Amazing Bulk is about equal with ""The Room"" and ""Birdemic"" as one of the worst movies ever created by human hands...The script makes absolutely no sense, the characters are so shallow it's repulsive, the environments (which by the way were all Green Screened) were un-rendered, unscaled, and unrealistic, the acting is repulsive, and the title monster is absolutely laughable...

This is one of those kind of movies that's best viewed with a few good friends and a bottle of booze. Or if you just get a kick out of watching terrible movies...regardless, this is a movie that you have to see to believe.

In the second part of the movie, they just stopped trying to try. They still kept a story line, and things were kosher enough, but it got silly and just bleh. It deserves the 2 stars it has, but with just a little more effort I think it could have reached a 3 star, which isn't that bad. 3 stars, for today, I believe would equal to a rainy day movie. 2 stars seems more like a 'put it on so the children at my home will shut up and stop bothering me' type of movie to methough.",1520380800,,639,3.923076923076923
