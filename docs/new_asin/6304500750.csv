7874107,1,6304500750,Dougs so broing the charecters voices suck and why are so of the charecters skin green and blue. Hello? do we live in the simpons world? I really don't get what the crator is trying to tell us bad anmations cool? Doug knows nothing? Having blue skin is coo.........ZZZZZZZ opps sorry just thinking about this made me dose off.  Still if you looking for a good old ncikloden cartoon watch rugrats or the first epsoides of sponge bob. This is a waste and not even worth 1 cent!,1147219200,,475,4.3977272727272725
