2349078,5,B000A0GXPG,Great for children. True story of our Lady's visit to the people of  Guadalupe near Mexico . She is the Queen of all the America's.,1396569600,,131,4.24
2349079,5,B000A0GXPG,"This is a great family movie or even just for the little ones too! Our 2 & 4 y/o sons, & 6 year old daughter ALL loved it! It is a terrific account of the story of Our Lady Of Guadalupe and is well done in all respects. The music with it is also catchy & enjoyable. It is one of those movies that we watch over & over again withOUT getting bored/annoyed. Educational. Fosters Christian values and devotion. Well worth it! :)  (As a side note, I also recommend ""Patrick - Brave Shepherd of the Emerald Isle"" produced in the same series which was also very well done. That one was equally well made in telling the story & entertaining to watch. I showed it to my 1st grade religious education class and they thoroughly enjoyed it as well as my own children.)",1366070400,,756,4.25

2349082,5,B000A0GXPG,"'Juan Diego: Messenger of Guadalupe' is a fun and educational cartoon that retells the story of an apparition of Mary that occurred in Mexico in the 1500s. During this apparition a miraculous image of Mary appeared on Juan Diego's tilma.

The cartoon does a good job at showing the tension that existed between the native population and Spanish conquerors at that time. Juan Diego is shown as being a convert to Catholicism that tries to reconcile his new faith with what he believed was beautiful in his traditional beliefs. His attempt found resistance from both natives and Spaniards until the apparition.

The cartoon then nicely illustrates the traditional account for the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe to Juan Diego and how after the apparition the population of Mexico became unified and many embraced the Catholic faith. It also does a good job at describing what is a tilma, the cloak on which the image was made.

Overall, this is a fun cartoon, with a simple plot with adventure and good music. I would highly recommend this DVD for children from age 2 to ages 10. It would also be a good cartoon to watch if you are interested in apparitions of Mary, the history of 16th century Mexico or the conversion of the Indigenous population in the New World. Well worth seeing.",1328918400,7,1287,4.762331838565022
2349083,5,B000A0GXPG,My children and students (in a Catholic K-8 school) really enjoyed this video.  It teaches them the story of Juan Diego and the Virgen of Guadalupe at their level.  Great animated story for kids ages 2 to 10.,1257552000,8,208,4.447368421052632
2349084,5,B000A0GXPG,"This is a great video for kids. We were very frustrated by the Disney videos which though well produced, get kids sucked into dramatic story lines with loud sound effects and music. They're very disturbing and seem to drive kids nutty. This includes stuff like Elmo. We didn't like the effect these productions have on kids and also the liberal cultural brainwashing is very evident. Actually, there is a lot about this Juan Diego film that would bother liberals if they ever happened to see it which they won't because of it's strong Catholic content (they won't even watch). So enjoy this solid Catholic entertainment for your children.",1235779200,6,638,4.916666666666667

8071989,4,B000A0GXPG,"Overall I thought this video was well done, but the parts that were put in as filler and entertainment confused children because they didn't know what was real and what was fictional.",1453507200,2,183,4.75

8071991,5,B000A0GXPG,"Great movie with a wonderful message of love and faith.  I was glad to share the story of Saint Juan Diego with my daughter and to learn more about his story myself.  I think anyone, Catholic or not, could get a lot out of this story, and the message of loving each other despite our differences, and finding common ground, is a good value to teach our children.  We have several of these movies from this company, and they are all nicely done and my daughter really enjoys them.",1436227200,,479,4.359550561797753
8071992,5,B000A0GXPG,"There were a few minor things here and there that could have been better but I love this movie!

This one is great in that you could let kids of all ages see it with no problem. I also like how it subtly touches on the politics of the time period. For an older kid, I could see a good discussion happening abou the role of missionaries, and how to balance helping others find God without denying them their culture.

I was also glad to see it in English and Spanish, including the song at the end. Another of those movies that can pull double duty when teaching kids.",1427760000,,567,4.192660550458716
