I bought this DVD for information not how it was shot and it's editing. Its filled with good content. I'm happy with my purchase and it arrived pretty quick.",1382054400,,265,4.32
8167442,4,B000M9BQ66,"i like this dvd and i watch it maybe every other month but its title is very misleading.
this is really not a how to dvd at all.
It is however a series of interesting and somewhat informative interviews with label owners and designers.
watching it several years down the track is also interesting as some of the labels featured are now players in the streetwear scene. its proof that they are now walking their talk.

if you are interested in streetwear in general or even a label owner there is something in this dvd that you will find at least inspiring if not useful.

roll on the promised part two i say",1271289600,,607,4.3628318584070795

8167444,2,B000M9BQ66,"No real insights to people who already have a bit of a clue how the streetwear business is running. Only interesting thing to me was to the faces behind some well known streetwear brands. but again, what they told me was nothing I didn't know before or you wouldn't know just by having common sense.",1171670400,2,299,4.454545454545454
8167445,4,B000M9BQ66,"After anticipating this dvd for almost a year, I was pleased with the information that was passed on. I'm an upstart designer [...] and there were a lot of jewels in the dvd that helped me. I wish there was a little bit more detailed information on the dvd. But in all this was a good start. Now I want to see pt. 2. Let's hope that we won't encounter long delays with pt. 2. :-)",1170288000,3,379,4.0
8167446,5,B000M9BQ66,"I never really had much interest in fashion until a buddy of tried starting his own label. He encountered many hardships, so it would have been nice if a film like this had been around when he was trying to get his stuff out. Learn upfront from industry Vets on how they got started and how much time, effort, and sweat it takes to be recognized. LRG, Triple Five Soul, Akademiks, Azzure, 10Deep, and many others give you a nice insight into the scene. From exposure at Magic in Vegas to Urban Magazines displays in Vibe and King, this video hits it all. Well worth the money, you won't be disappointed.",1169078400,6,603,4.441441441441442
