3022914,4,B000YAF4MA,"This movie is just about what you expect. Two late-middle-age guys, one indecently rich, the other comfortably un-rich, end up in the same hospital room facing the same no-win battle with cancer. The rich one, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson), owns the hospital, and is offended by having to share a room; he has made a virtue, however, of creating hospitals with unilateral service and few perks beyond good medical care for all - which his assistant points out - and to maintain his stand, he grumpily puts up with his roommate, Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).

Over the course of time together, they of course become friends (was there any other expectation?); Carter learns to ignore Edward's surly nature, and Edward finds Carter to be that unusual person; someone he can get along with. Both of them realize time is running out, and Edward, with boundless resources, proposes to fulfill an idle dream of Carter's which he happens upon: a ""list of things to do before we kick the bucket"".

With less capable personnel, this movie would have been no more than a Hallmark holiday presentation, but it barely tilts past middle-of-the-road because of the two principals of Nicholson and Freeman, neither of whom can throw a role. Morgan Freeman is famous for sage, compassionate, level-headed characters, and this is no exception. Nicholson is his typical bad-boy self, but is it ever possible to dislike either of them?

Together these veterans launch a full-fledged campaign against their coming debilities by jetting around the world, visiting exotic locales, and doing things they had always wanted to do but either never got around to or, in Carter's case, never had the money for. Edward's long-suffering assistant - another well-acted role by Sean Hayes - capably arranges for all their adventures with a totally blank face, putting up with all manner of rudeness from his employer.

I eagerly anticipated this movie (I'm a big Morgan Freeman fan) and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the knockout I thought it would be. I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed with it; I just thought there would be more - a twist, perhaps. Well-acted, held my interest. Four stars for the casting.",1200009600,2,2190,4.959128065395095
3022915,1,B000YAF4MA,"Easily, this would have topped my list of the Worst Films of 2007 had I seen it a mere 2 weeks ago.  Nevertheless, this could still be the worst movie-going experience of the New Year.  It's a cloying, manipulative, overacted, shameless piece of over-sentimental drivel.  Nicholson portrays yet another typical Nicholson role - a grotesque, exaggerated caricature of every performance he's given the past 2 decades or so, and Morgan Freeman resurrects his usual take on the everyman, cashing yet another easy paycheck.  Rob Reiner, with more hits than misses under his expanding belt, has directed a horror show more frightening in its audacity than his own ""Misery"".  My grade: D",1199836800,14,680,5.09009009009009

3022917,4,B000YAF4MA,"One of the most fun and uplifting films of the year, Rob Reiner's The Bucket List is also a likely contender for Academy Award nominations. Wonderfully sarcastic dialogue, poignant exchanges between excellently crafted characters, and an overall beautiful tale of mortality and morality, The Bucket List is an excellent opportunity for two of the greatest actors of our time to show off their inimitable techniques. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman have a chemistry that will have you laughing until you cry and crying at the sight of something truly majestic.

Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is an incredibly wealthy hospital owner who firmly believes that he's running infirmaries instead of health spas, and therefore demands that each room contain two beds and two patients. When a twist of fate lands him in his own hospital, he's stuck sharing a room with Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). Both men are dying of cancer, and the doctors give each of them only a few months left to live. The two slowly but surely realize how much they enjoy each other's company, so when Carter begins writing a ""bucket list"", Jack prompts him to see it through. The ""bucket list"" is a list of all the things both Edward and Carter would like to accomplish in their remaining months (before they kick the bucket) and with Cole's wealth, the two end up touring the world, skydiving and racecar driving. As their list of goals begins to come to an end, they realize how much they've truly lived just in the last few months alone, and how much their short friendship has impacted their lives.

Jack Nicholson's performance is excellent as the curmudgeonly Ebenezer character that receives a change of heart and a change of view with Carter's friendship. Little character development is necessary as we have come to recognize Jack's style over the years. We're already familiar with his character and relate to him in much the same way we feel about all of his recent projects. He's attained a level of recognition that allows us to acknowledge him simply as Jack. Regardless of his role, he's still Jack, and he doesn't disappoint.

The same can be said for Morgan Freeman who continues to play roles that accentuate his knack for worldly, wise and good-natured characters that can make us laugh and cry from moment to moment. Rarely do we see two actors work so well together - this odd couple appears to have been destined for these roles. The chemistry between these veterans is pleasantly refreshing, and because of it, The Bucket List is one of the most entertaining films of the year.

Another aspect, which is a great credit to screenwriter Justin Zackham, is the dialogue, which is continually hilarious even while it borders on heartbreaking. Sarcasm and cynicism are proudly worn by Jack, and the conversations conducted between the two are never dull. Meaningful, affecting and downright funny, the script is amazingly well paced and flows more naturally than anything in recent memory.

Nearly everything is likable about The Bucket List, except the tone of the film, which many awards voters and critics may feel is too repetitious of late. The film is uplifting and heartwarming, and while the conclusion strives for unpredictability, comparisons may be drawn to similarly crafted works. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""As Good as it Gets"" are immediately brought to mind, especially because these include the same actors, although the morals of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" are clearly beneath the surface of this feel-good comedy. Despite these comparisons, The Bucket List is wholesome entertainment that will certainly bring director Rob Reiner back into the spotlight, especially after his unpropitious previous project, ""Rumor Has It..."".

3022918,5,B000YAF4MA,"With strong performances from both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, this movie will be a shoo-in for numerous awards. The drama never becomes melodramatic; the movie never drags on or drags you down. There is a pureness of heart and a beauty in the script. There is friendships between the two characters that clearly stems from the actors respect of each other. The script is well done, but so is the direction. The movie is as funny as it poignant, as philosophical as it is perpetual. The movie's message might not be all too different from many other movies - find the joy in your life, seek your family, enjoy your last days to the fullest. Yet, the message is delivered in a wonderful way. The movie relies on Jack Nicholson's performance (more of the same unlikable, filthy rich grumpy old man, we've become accustomed to), but the unsung hero is Morgan Freeman - he brings humanity and humility to the movie and to his character.",1196899200,11,939,4.662650602409639

3022968,3,B000YAF4MA,"Sometimes you just watch a film and go ""meh... that was okay.""  It's not a wonderful film or even a particularly good one, nor is it offensively terrible or even ""so bad it's good.""  It's just a film, one that you enjoy while watching (provided you don't think too hard about it) and then forget soon after seeing.  And while Rob Reiner has made some memorable and great films in his time (""The Princess Bride,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Misery,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" and even the awful but still memorable ""North""), ""The Bucket List"" is fairly unmemorable, and while it has two strong actors and a fairly enjoyable plot, it's nothing to write home about.

""The Bucket List"" follows two very different men -- an obnoxiously arrogant hospital magnate named Edward (played by Jack Nicholson, who can play roles like this in his sleep) and a down-to-Earth, trivia-obsessed mechanic named Carter (played by Morgan Freeman) -- as they end up sharing a hospital room while undergoing treatment for terminal lung cancer.  Carter, as a means to pass the time between visits from the doctor, starts to fill out a ""bucket list"" of things he would like to accomplish before his death... a list that catches Edward's attention.  Wanting a diversion and seeing Carter as a means to that end, he ends up adding his own items to said list, and soon the two are off on a globe-trotting adventure to cross off everything on said list.  This doesn't go over well with Carter's wife... and when their failing health starts to catch up with them, both Carter and Edward come to realize that there are far more important things they want to do with their final days on Earth...

With a subject matter like this, it's almost impossible to avoid diving headfirst into some corny and schmaltzy scenes.  Reiner has had incredible success in the past balancing darker moments with sweetness, but here, despite the film revolving around death, he gets a little too saccharine for many people.  He did his best to give us a heartwarming film about death, and for the most part he succeeded... but at the cost of mostly avoiding the emotional impact of death and dying, instead focusing on a light-hearted ""buddy"" movie.  And while there's nothing wrong with light-hearted ""buddy"" movies, I do wish the film had spent a little more time exploring the more serious ramifications of its premise.  But that's just me.

Also, while Nicholson is in full form here, it feels like Freeman is given little to do.  Freeman can be a powerful actor given the right material, but this is one of his weaker roles.  And while he does an admirable job with what little he's given, it's still not enough to elevate the movie very far.  And while he's meant to be a foil to Nicholson's egotistical millionaire, he has his own jerkish moments that can kill any sympathy the audience has for him.

Despite my complaints, this movie isn't outright terrible.  It's enjoyable, and quite pretty to look at (there's some gorgeous cinematography from around the world to watch).  It's just not one that's bound to stick with the viewer for very long.  And coming from a director who's given us some truly memorable films over the years, that's a disappointment.",1505088000,,3222,4.7504488330341115

Which, given their diagnosis, might not be so far from the truth. It's got a good heart, but the two legendary leads don't get much script to really sink their teeth into and the trouble they find together often crosses from quaintly naive to downright unrealistic. To me, there was far more of interest in the relationship between Nicholson's grumpy, wannabe-refined old miser and his ironic, long-suffering personal assistant than between Jack and his calm, knowledgeable new travel partner. Still, it has a cute concept, some fun moments, and it moves swiftly, avoiding the typical bog-down of most films of a similar subject matter.

the story

Edward Cole owns many hospitals and he has become very rich possibly at the expense at some of the patients who have stayed in his inpatient rooms. When people complain of crowded rooms and no privacy, his mantra is ""this is a hospital, not a health spa. Two to a room, no exceptions."" Suddenly, Mr. Cole finds himself very ill with brain cancer and he needs to be hospitalized and treated. He finds himself sharing a room with another man with cancer, his name is Carter Chambers. At first, the two don't get along all too well, but when they both learn that they have six months to a year to live, they share a common bond.

While the two were still sharing a room in the hospital, Edward finds a list that Carter was making of things to do before he died, he called it the bucket list. After making additions and a few changes, Edward proposes that the two of them fulfill this list together. So they set out to see the world's greatest sites, to eat the best foods, to face some intense thrills and in the meanwhile comforting each other, becoming friends and more than that, brothers.

There's much more to it, but this is the basic gist of things. You'd have to rent or buy this movie to experience all that it has to offer.

the breakdown

Predictability in a movie tends to be something of a dealbreaker when it comes to enjoying the movie. Bucket List is truly predictable, in fact any movie which employs either Jack Nicholson and/or Morgan Freeman is going to be somewhat predictable. You know Jack Nicholson (The Shining, Batman) is going to play the stubborn-minded white guy who it takes a while to get to know the softer side. Morgan Freeman (Bruce Almighty, The Shawshank Redemption) is always the level headed black guy who maintains the voice of reason and is here to be a kind of life coach. However, Bucket List feels like a breath of fresh air. The constant dialog, the drama, the laughs and of course the emotional connection is so ever present for the viewer to enjoy as Bucket List quickly becomes one of their favorite movies.

The story is one that is easily relatable to all of us, because it deals with our own mortality. Every one of us is going to die, and this film touches upon this subject in a different way than presented before. Conversations between the two characters about what to do with the time they have left, and what to expect on the other side is very frankly discussed. This sort of thing may be prevalent in a Christian film, but not so much in Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, there's no eye-opening or deep philosophical meaning to be found here. It's just more of candidly presenting two popular belief systems that we have in the world, 1. there is a God, or 2. there is no God. Can you guess which character believes what? Remember, Freeman played God in two movies recently.

The performances of Jack and Morgan are what you would expect, predictable but brilliant. I also enjoyed Sean Hayes' (Will and Grace) comedic performance as Thomas (Ed's personal assistant), his witty one-liners and calm comebacks to Jack Nicholson's crude remarks were priceless. Morgan's character asks him at one point in the film what he prefers to be called Tom or Thomas. He replies Matthew, but Ed calls him Thomas because Matthew sounded too biblical for him. Of course Thomas is another biblical name, but maybe that was to add the ironic humor to the moment or just a reflection on the writer's lack of biblical knowledge.

There are more subplots involved that have to do with both of the lives of the main characters, but this was sort of unpredictable and I don't want to give away too much. Plus I think that the basic premise of the movie sells itself enough for you to want to watch it anyway. The side effects of cancer treatment and chemotherapy especially were presented well, I went through chemo myself and I really felt for these guys who were only pretended to experience it. Surely this film is a future classic; I know that I'll be watching this over and over for years to come.

While sharing a hospital room, finding out that they both have less than a year to life, they decide that they should make the most of the time that they have left. Chambers decides to make a bucket list, and Cole decides to jump in on helping to make the list. Throughout the movie, the two come together and travel the world to do the things on their bucket-list. Everything comes to an end when Chambers finds out that Cole has a daughter that he has been disconnected with for a long time. After not talking for awhile, Cole is asked to speak at Chamber's funeral. Cole decides that he will cross off another item on the list. The end of the movie shows that both of the men, after passing away, finished the bucket list and got buried together.

3023691,5,B000YAF4MA,"I disclose that I actually purchased this Bucket List dvd (Starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson) from my job for just 5 dollars at least over three to four months ago. This movie stars Jack Nicholson as billionaire hospital businessman Edward Cole and Morgan Freeman as a hard working car mechanic named Carter Chambers who also has a passion for history. Both Edward Cole and Carter Chambers strike up an unexpected friendship after meeting in a hospital while fighting for their lives. Ironically enough, Edward Cole is rushed to the hospital after having a meeting pertaining to his business dealings with a hospital. Carter Chambers if first shown eventually being rushed to the hospital after successfully answering some trivia questions given to him by a coworker and mentioning about Tesla. There is also a cultural reference to the Divine Comedy in this film. Edward Cole has led a very successful material life, but his relationships have been another story. Meanwhile, Carter Chambers loves his wife Virginia Chambers (Beverly Todd0 and other members of his family a lot. However, Chambers decides to go on a bucket list trip with Cole because all of mostly his grown life has been spent putting others before himself. Chambers realizes that he wants to use some of his remaining months to enjoy his life before he dies. One of the touching scenes in the film is where the character of Cole is shown diplomatically but firmly insisting to his doctor that he also asks Chambers if he has any health questions as well instead of leaving him to wait longer than needed for the other doctor. Some of the adventures that Edward Cole and Carter Chambers go on together involve bungee jumping and going on a safari via seeing some animals. Coles assistant Matthew (Sean Hayes) helps tend to Coles end of life business dealings and the bucket list trip. The following features to this film are; movie trailers for Semi-Pro, Bernard and Doris, Mamas Boy, and Get Smart. The Screenwriter of Bucket List (under the special feature of Writing A Bucket List) explains the idea behind why he decided to script The Bucket List (Mario Sorrenti is credited to have played a role in directing the Bucket List). There is also an additional bonus of getting more special features if this dvd is inserted in the dvd rom player of a personal computer. Last,, but not least, this dvd has a special feature of the music video for Say What You Need To Say by John Mayer (including scenes for the movie).",1437091200,,2494,4.829439252336448

3024006,5,B000YAF4MA,"On my 5th viewing, if you listen carefully to the script there is alot of gems to still gain from this movie. A movie's greatness is often measured by how much it impacts ourselves, our own lives, whether it prompts us to change. This one is a must. Both character has some sort of regret... Carter missing out on becoming history teacher and college because first child came early... Edward's regret is his failed relationship w his daughter, the only person he really cares about. And then terminal cancer comes along to shock you and remind you about life's fragility. The impact of this movie is probably how it moved a generation of people to explore their own ""Buckets List"", what it means to do something, to want something, and then go out and find it or explore it or visit it, or see it... when their trip of exploratory is finished, they both return home to the reality of their given lives... a home, a family in Carter's case, and a mean nothing business venture in Edwards case, the latter's lack of connection w others in terms of deep relationships become more profound, meanwhile Carter's return home to his own family reminds him of what really matters... when one's time is coming up short. This movie is a Classic, because it dares to capture a tough subject, and it handles it gently w a sense of reality, humanity, and lastly a light touch of comedy.

Update July 2016. Wow, has it really been 8 years since I saw and reviewed this movie? A measure of a movie is how long its impression stays w you over time, and I can say after 8 years, this movie and its message has stayed w me, and continues to be one of my top all time movies, mainly due of its human message, that we are all mortal, struck between the bookend of our own death, whether we are suddenly struck w cancer or otherwise, and the theme of a buckets list, continues to resonate w me in my own life, things I wanna do, places I wanna go to, and visit, and experience before I kick the bucket. Don't we all have these secret destinations? Dare we accomplish them or most of them, before we kick the bucket? This movie makes you ponder about your own life choices, and how you wish to live it, like no other movie.

3024149,4,B000YAF4MA,"The Bucket List is a movie about two old men who find out that they are terminally ill and decide to live their life to the fullest.  It was directed by Rob Reiner who is also known for Alex & Emma which I will be reviewing some time later.  As far as this movie goes it was written by Justin Zackham.

This was another movie which was a step out of my comfort zone but I feel that is the only way that I am going to grow as a critic.  It starts off with Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) who is a mechanic working then he gets a phone call and ends up back in the hospital.  He is married and has three children who he loves dearly but lately feels a little disconnected from.  Then we get to billionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) who owns many hospitals, and is single because he has been through many marriages and he also has a daughter that won't talk to him.  Edward find's himself winding up in one of his own hospitals and due to his own work ethics, his hospital puts him in the same room as Carter, instead of giving him his own room.  During their time together the two become very close and then they both find out how much time they have left.  Edward finds Carter's 'bucket list' on the ground which lists everything that he wants to do before he dies and he decides to add to it.  He then invites Carter to join him on the most amazing journey this new friendship could offer.

This scene where they are about to jump out of the plane is by far one of my favorite in the movie.  There is a part where Edward refers to his second wife as the sequel and he wonders why she hated him so much and one of the sky divers says maybe its because you called her the sequel.

Both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman worked really well together on this.  They make you believe that they are both terminally ill and on a journey to live their final days on an adventure to complete an awesome bucket list.  I think it helps that the two of them are both the same age because it adds to how genuine the movie feels.

Overall I would give this movie a B.  The acting and chemistry was great but there were some other aspects of the movie that really stood out that bothered me and that was during the car chase when the cars would magically keep losing their dents and also some scenes Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson's makeup was not put on great and you could notice it.  Other than that check it out because the story is great!",1412640000,,2434,4.164529914529915

3024154,1,B000YAF4MA,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after reading so many good reviews about it. The theme also sounded like it would be fun and endearing and Jack Nicholson is one of my fav all time actors. What it ended up being was a huge disappointment.

How anyone can call this movie ""hilarious"" or that Freeman and Nicholson had such ""good chemistry"" together, is a total mystery

The acting seemed stilted and contrived, the two lead characters never seemed to bond as real friends.

It's also VERY depressing with a lot of emphasis on the ""miracles"" of modern medicine that in the end were of no use to either of these men. As a person who lives a drug-free life, I was hoping this would be about giving the Grim Reaper a run for his money at the end, maybe a ""second chance"" for at least one of the characters, healthwise and with LOTS of laughs and funny scenes to enjoy. Not....on all counts!

This one is headed for the library free box. Give this one a miss unless you like to watch depressing, badly acted movies.

When both receive bad news about their progress, they decide to put together a bucket list and experience life for the remaining time they have left.

I loved this movie, both their experiences in the hospital as well as when traveling the world.  Both are affected by the relationship with the other and become a better person because of it.  I was surprised by Sean Hayes as it took me a while to recognize him as the verbally abused assistant to Nicholsons character.  Really enjoyed how he deals with his boss.  I actually felt a little uplifted when the movie ended.

3024271,5,B000YAF4MA,"Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman...now there's a powerhouse!  This generation's ""The Defiant Ones""!  This film should have done better then it did.  It should have swept the Oscars, destroyed all box office records, and be declared among the greatest films of all time!  But, even if it was denied these accolades, it is still a fine film.  Our leads play a pair of men, previously unknown to one another, who become hospital roommates as they both learn that they have terminal cancer.  Deciding to make their remaining time count, they set out on an around-the-world trip, one of them being rich enough to easily finance the venture for the pair and his assistant/butler/verbal punching bag ""Thomas"", played by Sean Hayes...I actually found the explanation of this character's name to be among the funniest parts of the movie.  This film worked because of the chemistry that Freeman and Nicholson built up throughout their time together...you could see their friendship rise and fall with each passing event.  I don't know much, if anything, about Beverly Todd, but I felt she was just there so Morgan Freeman could have a wife.  I just don't like it when there's a couple on the screen and we only get to know one person and the other one's just...there.  I don't care if the story wasn't about her...she still deserves a real personality.  But that's my only complaint.  This was still a really great and funny film.  To bad it just didn't do better.  I highly recommend it.  Enjoy.",1403827200,2,1487,4.822134387351778

3024342,5,B000YAF4MA,"Car mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is at the garage tinkering with a Chevrolet Camaro - cigarette in his gob like it always has been for 45 years. He smiles as his younger co-worker quizzes him on five former American Presidents whose surnames begin with H (Carter has a thing for accumulating knowledge). He of course gets their names right. But then mid explanation on the next question (which man actually invented the radio) - his Doctor phones with test results - and the cigarette that was placed between Carter's fingers to take the call falls to the greasy floor...

Meanwhile in a courtroom far away - four-times married multi-millionaire Edward Penniman Cole (Jack Nicholson) is assimilating hospital number 16 into his privatized portfolio. Sipping his Indonesian Kopi Luwak (the most expensive coffee in the world) from a Gold mobile dispenser - he asks his puppet assistant to give the panel of trustees ""the spiel..."" Their financially failing Hospital needs him and no matter what their 'moral posturing' maybe - in his moneymaking medical palaces there are two beds to every room for patients (no exceptions). But in the middle of another crass speech about how he's running a hospital and not a health spa - Edward suddenly starts to cough something into his handkerchief that isn't phlegm...

Next both wildly different men find themselves lumped together in the same room of a Hospital Edward Cole owns. But because of bad PR - the grouchy Cole can't get a private room to be away from ""the living dead over there"". Gradually across chemo, operations, puking and diarrhoea - they become reluctant buddies of sorts. One day Edward finds a yellow jotter page on the floor on which Carter has written ""The Bucket List"". It's what his former college tutor told him to write as a young man - things you want to do before you 'kick the bucket'...

Recovered momentarily and now with a diagnosis of 6 months and one year respectively - Edward persuades Carter not to go home to his Nurse wife Veronica and his three kids to be swallowed by pity and grief - but to take a shot at all the things he's wanted to do. After all money is not a problem. And despite his wife's misgivings - Carter knows Edward is right. It's now or never. So they skydive, get a tattoo, drive a Mustang Shelby 360, laugh until they cry, kiss the most beautiful woman in the world, witness something majestic...and so on.

Part of the joy of ""The Bucket List"" is watching two acting giants given great material - let rip with it - and that's what you get here. The chemistry and obvious respect between Freeman and Nicholson leaps off every frame and Director Rob Reiner never interferes - even when the film is being silly and a little preposterous. In fact in the first 30 or 40 minutes as they navigate the physical and mental agonies of terminal illness in a Hospital - ""The Bucket List"" is truly touching movie-making - with a razor-sharp script and life observations that don't feel obvious nor too cutesy.

Even in the second-half where the story demands they do their comedy party pieces - the conversations between them on Cole's private jet and in a luxurious hotel bathtub are filled with classy one-liners and power delivery (beautifully scripted by Justin Zackham). And it's funny too (most of which is provided by the incomparable Jack Nicholson). By the time it gets to The Shawshank Redemption Morgan Freeman voiceover end - when a Chock-Full-Of-Nuts tin is being carried up a mountain - you're a willing convert.

This is major Hollywood movie and the picture quality on the BLU RAY is simply glorious. Defaulted to 1.85:1 Full Aspect - the frame fills the entire screen and there isn't a shot that doesn't look immaculate and impressive. Even the CGI of the chat about his daughter Emily on top of the Pyramids is convincing (title above) - as is the motorbike ride on the Great Wall of China and their walks around the Taj Mahal. Audio is Dolby Digital English, French and Spanish 5.1 for each - while the Subtitles offered are English, French and Spanish.

The Extras are delightful - interviews with both leads, Director Ron Reiner, the Screenwriter, a Making of and John Mayer's gorgeous acoustic balled ""Say"".

As he treks through snow keeping a promise to a man he first despised but then grew to love - Carter Chambers says of Edward Cole - ""When he died...his eyes were shut...and his heart was open...""

""The Bucket List"" has been a joy to re-watch on BLU RAY. Do yourself a solid - and open your bruised ticker to this modern-day nugget...",1396742400,,4565,4.7320754716981135

One will enjoy following both men on their adventures and it hits home when we realize how fast our lifetime goes and how much of it the average person wishes they could do over, just to explore our dreams.

Nicholson and Freeman were a marvelous pairing and incredibly funny despite the weighty subject matter.  Had a wonderful time with the family and we laughed until we cried.  My only regret is the seemingly unavoidable use of foul language.  Had this movie been made in the 40's, it would have been just as funny and just as weighty without bad language.  However, in all honesty, the language aspect is sadly more of a commentary on the state of our contemporary society than it is about movie-making.  That said, rent or buy this movie and enjoy it with your adult family members, especially if you're like me and take PG-13 to mean ""not recommended for viewers under 30 years of age"".",1388793600,,795,4.895522388059701

3024778,5,B000YAF4MA,"What I expected to be a rather interesting, sometimes funny, but also deeply depressing film ended up being much the opposite. The bucket list ended up being a life affirming film from start to finish. It's not about death, it's really about life. Living life to the fullest and setting things right. It's a film about two men standing at the door to death and deciding it's time to really live life for the first time before they die. The characters Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play are such complete opposites, yet they had something in common that they understood. Working together they find the courage and meaning to live out their last days doing the things they never did in all their years on earth, and in only 3 months they ended up doing more than most people do in a lifetime. And along the way they came to understand what true frienhship, love, and forgivness are really all about. I am so greatful to Rob Reiner for making this film because exploring the subject of death and telling a story of hope at the same time is a tough nut to crack. But this film succeeds in telling a story that needed to be told and doing so in such a wonderful way. In the end the message was loud and clear for me. Live life to the fullest and make peace with those you love, leaving all grudges behind forever . That is why I am giving 'The bucket list' 5 stars.

They come up with a list of places they want to see, and activities they need to do, while they're still here on Earth. Of course there are some of the most common destinations on their list, but it's still fun to see them do it all.

3024802,3,B000YAF4MA,"It was entertaining. I thought that the most important thing that happened in the movie was that each of them learned how better to love another which impacted more lives than their own. I thought their religious views were devoid of any value. But they seemed to view life like many Americans, so maybe that was the goal of the director/writer, to connect with the audience?
I have to say that I pray to God that I would not spend my last days trying to grab the gusto of the secular dream. I thought that they missed the point of life. I was saved about 9 years ago at age 53 and my priorities are undergoing a major shift as I become more familiar with the Bible.

If you have not read through the Bible, I pray that you might consider it. Before I did, I had spent at least two decades investigating eastern religion, philosophy, and psychology, only to become a fence sitter because I could not derive any meaning out of anything I had experienced. I had been a Bahai for about 5 years and studied Zen for at least that long. Although I had read parts of the Bible numerous times, I did not read through it until my 3rd marriage crashed and burned. God lifted me up out of the wreckage of that and gave me the interest to read through the Bible. I was finally able to believe in creationism. Formerly, I thought creationism and evolution were both fantastic theories that took more faith than I had to believe....

3024875,5,B000YAF4MA,"Last night's movie was ""The Bucket List"" DVD, a simple story, well told. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were  superb in their leading roles. Hats off to the directing by Rob Reiner. Basically, Nicholson and Freeman meet in a hospital (owned by Nicholson) and both are expected to die within a year. They jointly decide to make up a list of things to do before they kick the bucket, and off they go on an around-the-world adventure supported by the immense wealth of Nicholson. The DVD cover bills it as ""Hysterically Funny"" and I got a lot of good chuckles out of it, to be sure. However, I found the film to be immensely sad, perhaps aided by the fact that I'm now approaching 77 and can faintly perceive my own bucket sitting out there on the distant horizon. Well, it's something we all face and it's a good thing to think about, no matter what your age might be. We all need a Bucket List.

Some of the things on the bucket list are just standard, like traveling to distant Africa to view the wildlife, hiking in the Himalayas or driving a race car. Some are border-line crazy, like sky diving. No matter, it's a funny list and you'll be chuckling as you work your way through it. Some are simple but touching, like laughing so hard that you cry. Well, who hasn't done that? My guess would be quite a few. It's both a touching and funny movie. In their adventure and their growing friendship they also decide what to do with their remains and they both disdain conventional solutions and end up with their ashes stashed in a couple old coffee cans in a beautiful local. This is an excellent movie, one of the best I've seen in months and months. I can't believe I purchased the DVD for about five bucks.

3024935,1,B000YAF4MA,"This was a good story and should have been a good movie.  It had scenes in other countries.

I would have given more stars if it had not been spoiled for us because Jack Nicholson
continued to use Jesus Christ's name as a form of extreme displeasure of different events.

For serious Christians, this will be hurtful, unacceptable, and disturbing to say the least!
It was disrespectful to the actual historical Jesus and what he did for everyone who believe in Him.

Morgan Freeman was a Christian and tried to help Nicholson's character see the truth.
I enjoyed Freeman's character and how he portrayed it.

It was unnecessary to limit the ENJOYABLE viewing of such an otherwise good movie to those who do not love Jesus.

I do not write many reviews, but after paying to buy this movie based on the awards and usually good actors, I feel sad and bad.

3025115,4,B000YAF4MA,"Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are room-mates in a hospital that Cole actually owns. He insisted he was running a hospital and not a vacation spa, and there were no private rooms. Two patients to a room, no exceptions.

They both have cancer, and both have terminal diagnoses. So Cole, who has way more money than he knows what to do with, proposes they spend their remaining time doing all the things they want to do before they die. The term ""Bucket List"" came from a professor where Carter went to college who asked them to compose such a list as a philosophy class exercise.

So they do it. Some of the scenes are pretty funny, such as their skydiving adventure, their driving race cars, and so on. But it is also very thoughtful as they sit in a classy restaurant over caviar and talk about family matters.

I won't spoil it by telling you what happens, but one item stands out. While in India visiting the Taj Mahal, they talk about funeral plans. Carter says he wants to be cremated, his ashes put in a tin can and buried somewhere wild. ""Like a Chock Full of Nuts can?"" jokes Cole, ""The heavenly coffee!""

The last scene is Cole's assistant placing a second Chock Full of Nuts can in the cairn at the top of a snow-capped mountain.",1336953600,,1274,4.478448275862069
3025116,2,B000YAF4MA,"Miss-matched buddy dramedies are a dime a dozen these days.  Very rarely do they star two juggernaut actors like Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.  Very rarely are they this devoid of merit.  I'm bewildered at how poorly conceived this film was, when you consider the names involved.  I really wanted to see this.  Sure, it looked corny and unappealing on the outset, but it also stars one of the greatest actors ever (Nicholson) and one of the more understated and nuanced of his generation (Freeman), so the possibilities were endless here.  Instead of challenging these two men to provide us with something insightful and profound, we are left with a film that casts Nicholson as the loudmouthed jerk and Freeman as the quietly sincere `wise' soul.  Seriously, why are such great actors relegated to playing the same character in every film?  Why couldn't Nicholson be the quiet one for a change?  Why can't we see Morgan Freeman boss people around and show lack of personal regard for everyone around him?  I just want something to differentiate this from the last dozen movies these two have starred in.  YUCK.  Seriously, this is saccharine to the hilt, and the forced upon comedic aspects feel redundant and underwhelming.  Thankfully, even when handed the same boring predictable loaf of a character these actors seem to do their best with the role, so they make it at least somewhat watchable (they have great chemistry), but this is a generic story with no arc that isn't 100% predictable.  I just want to slap someone in the face right now.",1333065600,6,1552,4.85171102661597

The idea of fulfilling a list of things to do before you die obviously gained some traction after the 2007 release of this film. The movie features two of our finest ""older"" actors in a script that doesn't really challenge them or the viewer, but it's still an entertaining and thought-provoking film. It gets better with subsequent viewings. I especially enjoyed the DVD special feature in which screenwriter Justin Zackham explains the genesis of the script; it came from his own genuine Bucket List.",1332115200,,621,4.867924528301887
3025120,5,B000YAF4MA,"Sometimes movies inspire, sometimes movies evoke emotions. Sometimes they put you on the edge of your seat or make you laugh and simply make you feel good.

The Bucket List does almost all of that. It's not a fast paced action movie, so I wasn't on the edge of my seat like Avatar, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, or Gladiator, but this is an incredible story.

Two men have a chance meeting. Their friendship struggles to get started, but evolves into a bond like Superglue and sets in motion a series of events that address all the characteristics above.

If you know someone with a temrinal illness, have days where you feel down, or simply need a pick-me-up, this is a must see. It is a moving and inspiring film for all generations.",1331596800,,739,4.541353383458647

3025142,5,B000YAF4MA,I originally saw this movie in the theater and decided that it was one that I wanted to add to my DVD collection.  This is both an entertaining and thought provoking movie. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson most certainly rank highly among the great actors of our time.  The sobering story of illness and looming end of life is conveyed with humor and warmth.  It has made me think about what I want on my own Bucket List.,1331424000,,422,4.384615384615385
3025143,3,B000YAF4MA,"I had purchased this movie, and in my opinion, enjoyed it!  I love Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson as actors and found their chemistry on screen worth wild.  Initially the previews of the movie looked stupid and not up my ally, It was not one I wanted to initially purchase, but I was surprized when I watched the movie for the first time.

The movie is about 2 men, who led seperate lives until Nicholson found out he had cancer.  (Nicholson plays a man that owns / runs a string of Hospitals on a cost cutting basis.  Freeman is a retired auto mechanic.)  Subsequently Nicholson get's treatment in one of his own hospitals and Freeman is his roommate.  On this premise the movie does start out a little slow to the get go, and can be a little sad or depressing.  The base topic is something that has touched many peoples lives.

As the movie progresses, the 2 men become close friends.  They decided to do the ""Bucket List"" which is a list that Freeman had started in the hospital.  The humor does pick up at times, and you can't help but laugh at a few points through out the movie.

Towards the end it does get back to reality, with them both getting sick at different times, and both surcoming to cancer.  And at the end both are burried in a coffee can next to each other.

Personally feel the movie has an OK beggining, fun middle, and a sad ending, may not have been an Oscar type of movie, but I think it was worth the purchase!",1330214400,,1439,4.301115241635688

3025148,1,B000YAF4MA,"2007 film. I thought I'd be nasty and give one star. Because....
[1] The two main characters are too synthetic. Nicholson as a billionaire in hospitals - a field noted for groups operating illegally. Not at all realistic, and the character is absurd - more or less acquaintance-less, perhaps to keep the cost down; and also without anything one imagines billionaires to have, from sophistication (there's a drawn-out thing with a type of coffee he would certainly know the details of) to grasp of his business and will. The other one is a sort of Nelson Mandela type, not showing the sorts of characteristics noted by US blacks. In the same way blacks are promoted as athletes - for want of anything else - this character is shown as a TV quiz type, quoting simple-minded factoids, though the script does allow a bit of play there.
[2] The events are too obviously selected to be tear-jerking, like some guilty person making up a story about a dying relative as an excuse. This is of course is a standard technique; it doesn't really work here, because of the extreme contrasts of the operations, shaved heads, near-death, and stumbling around in hospital clothing stuff, with the going round the world material. As is a Hollywood standard, the black character is morally impecable, turning down, for example, a sh*g with a woman presumably paid by Nicholson. Some of the regret material seemed better, but, well...
[3] The effects didn't quite work... the scenes trying to race cars showed the characters talking to each other through open windows; and with obviously implausible stunt scenes. The landscapes look processed and fake - an 'Egyptian monument' was some studio thing.

The bonus material includes a chat with scriptwriter - one of whose ambitions was to get a film made 'by a major studio'. Possibly worth a look by would-be scriptwriters. I wonder why actors, who after all must have some experience of the world, never seem to write anything. Maybe it's just easier to get a call from an agent, read up a bit, and turn up to do your takes and retakes.",1328313600,5,2067,4.7899159663865545

3025196,5,B000YAF4MA,"Well after reading the various reviews here it is quite apparent that while most like and love this movie, there never-the-less are those who do not.  Number me with those who is quite fond of it.  You can tell that by the fact that I have viewed in three times and I am one of those people who NEVER see a movie I like or dislike a second time.

The overall plot has been done to death there with plenty of spoilers for all.  I would be sort of redundant of me to give you a blow by blow account of the movie.  There are quite a number of well written reviews to choose from here so it you want to know all about the movie without having to bother watching it; read one of them.

Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and I have never watched a movie of his that I did not like, or at least like the part he was playing.  Freeman has been given some horrid scripts to work with over the years and despite the fact that he has played in some real losers (Hey, they guy has to make a living you know), he has always come though and I have never seen him give a bad performance.  Now this movie is good and his teaming up with Jack was perfect.  They played off of each other perfectly.

Now some have said this is a sad film and indeed, there are aspects of it that are sad.  But that being said, sad though death may be, it is still a part of life; as big a part of life as birth and living when you stop and think about it.  Evan though there were most certainly sad parts of this film, there were also some very, very funny scenes and I found myself laughing quite a lot as the story unfolded.

None of us want to die; I know I am not overly fond of the idea myself, but I know I am eventually going to do so.  I just hope I can face the big final scene with the class these two portrayed in the movie.

3025200,4,B000YAF4MA,"I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman and try to catch one of his movies now and then.  The Bucket List I had heard a lot about but never really gave it much thought one way or the other.  But the late night movie bug caught and it was available, so I finally got my chance to see it.

When billionaire hospital owner Edward Cole ends up in his own hospital, he never expects to make a friend in auto-mechanic Carter Chambers.  However, the two do strike up an unlikely bond and on the spur of a moment decision, after being handed their ""death sentences"" for cancer, they decide to fulfill a bucket list.  Or rather a list of things to do before they kick the bucket.  They go sky diving, travel the world, but eventually Carter realizes he should be at home with his family.  Edward is not so confident in this change of events though and isn't sure how to take it when Carter tries to give him the same gift of realization.  They both don't have that long to live, but its still hard to decide what to do with their lives.

Characters:
Edward Cole: Jack Nicholson
Carter Chambers: Morgan Freeman

I really like these two actors but don't think that this is their best performances ever.  They still do a good job but while polar opposites of each other at times, sometimes it seemed a little too contrived.  Freeman's character was a little too sage while Nicholson's was a little too out there to be believable sometimes.  Still, it was nice to see them pal around.

For a plot this moved along pretty good.  It was interesting, albeit a bit unbelievable at times but since its a movie I'm allowing to suspend reality for a bit.  It was interesting to see some of the stuff on the bucket list, although it seems a lot of it would be standard for everyone (go on safari, travel the world, etc.) but some of it was unique to the characters and that was nice.  Some of the scenes were a little cheesy and you could tell they were backdrops instead of the actual place which was a surprising thing to me considering when the movie was made.  I also don't remember much of the music which means that it must have just been background filler.

Not a bad movie but not the most excellent either of these two have done.  I'd probably watch it again.

The story line of the movie is touching and is likely pull at the heart strings of most people.  However, though the subject matter of the film is pretty depressing, it is dealt with in a relatively lighthearted way which keeps the film from being too gloomy to be enjoyable.

Priced under $10, the DVD is a well-priced and worth buying if this is a movie that you're interested in adding to your collection.

The DVD has some special features, including an interview with the screenplay writer of The Bucket List.  It also has interactive features.  However, the features don't seem to work on Mac computers and getting them to work on a PC also seems to be an uphill battle.  When I loaded the disc onto my PC, it turned out that I would have needed to download all sorts of Windows Media patches, etc. etc. to get the features to work, so I gave up.  Instead of spending time messing with my computer to try to get the disc to work, I decided that I should spend the time working on my own bucket list.",1308441600,,1235,4.358078602620087

Both Nicholson and Freeman manage to pull off the perfect mix of comedy and poignancy in this film without becoming too cheesy or schmaltzy. The premise is actually very simply (2 terminally ill patients working their way through their own Bucket list) but manages to capture their relationships, fears about dying, philosophy about life and more besides in it's short but very sweet 90 minutes. I was kept thoroughly engaged the whole time and enjoyed every minute as they worked their way through a variety of experiences, from sky diving, getting a tattoo, to kissing the most beautiful girl in the world and a whole host of other things. This made for a fun film, with the right elements of humour and sadness and made a serious point about relishing your life without hammering the point home. It left me wondering about what experiences I've yet to try and with an all round good feeling. You can't ask much more from a film really. Great story, great acting and well worth a try.

3025232,4,B000YAF4MA,"I don't normally pick comedies, but was very happily surprised by this one.  Two guys bond while sharing a hospital room, sharing terminal cancer.  There is real chemistry between them, a give and take by two men who have virtually nothing in common.  One is a hard-nosed businessman, the other a mechanic with a wonderful self-taught mind.

The plot revolves about a list of things they want to do before their time is up.  Nicolson is rich, so he invites Freeman on a tour of the world, where they skydive, attempt to trek in the Himalayas, and stay in exotic locales, crossing things off the list as more and more is revealed about the characters' lives.  They change each other and then make major steps in their lives.

Sure, this is a tried and true formula, but these actors pull it off with true originality and excellence.  I laughed, was moved, and delighted in the philosophy of life that emerges through the journey of the film.  It is genuinely beautiful and very fun.

3025233,2,B000YAF4MA,"I wish I could say I enjoyed this movie and was worth paying to watch, but I honestly cannot.  In drama there is a phrase regarding the viewer having a ""willful suspense of disbelief.""  I never found that possible due to poor chemistry between Nicholson and Freeman in this disjointed, predictable storyline.

I really think the topic is decent, it does not have to be so scary one cannot find their own humor in it, but as a viewer I felt as though it (and I) were disrespected and dumbed down.

Seriously, both of these older gentlemen have BRAIN surgery and recover in no time perfectly with all brain function intact?  They have none of the ongoing issues of Cancer patients with fatigue, etc.?  How realistic is it Freeman receives the call at work that he has Cancer, especially when his wife is a nurse?  One scene Nicholson tears up the bucket list and in another scene they are writing on it again!  I found myself terribly distracted by these odd moments.

I love a good heartwarming story, especially those with a solid message you can take with you, where you see a lives transformed (like Shawshank Redemption or The Blind Side).  This is not one of those movies.

3025241,4,B000YAF4MA,"The phrase ""the bucket list"" has become part of our culture.  The concept is to make a list of all the things you want to do before you die and then do them.  Seems like a good idea.

This 2008 film, staring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is based on this concept.  These two men are fine actors.  They bring their years of experience, subtleties of expression and past fame to their roles of two terminally ill cancer patients who meet in the hospital and then go off to live their dreams before they die. Nicholson is the rich one who can finance all sorts of adventures for the two of them.  Freeman is the hardworking family man who has worked all his life as a mechanic and never got a chance for a formal education. Together they make a good team and their performances are excellent.

The script, however, leaves much to be desired.  First of all, it is NOT a comedy although its publicity makes it seem so.  Second of all, it is just not real.  Terminally ill patients don't have the stamina to go sky diving, big game hunting in Africa, etc.  Freeman's life is all family and just too sickly sweet.  Nicholson's final reconciliation with a daughter who hates him contains no surprises.  And the film itself, instead of being uplifting, is actually sort of depressing.

However, this movie has one big redeeming value.  It makes a person think about his or her own life and what is really important.  And if a film can do that, it has achieved something more than just plain entertainment.",1291939200,,1500,4.5

3025264,3,B000YAF4MA,"I should have loved this film. I really like Nicholson and Freeman. I also enjoy a good dramedy, even those about death -- one of my all-time favorites is Better Off Dead. It must be very difficult to pull off funny when the subject is death, so to do so is impressive. The Bucket List tries, and sometimes gets very close... but I didn't love this film. It was okay. I don't regret the time invested, but, I'm not adding it to my library.

Why?

There was a manipulative feel to it, at times too much emotion, and others a lack that seemed extreme even when taking the grieving process into account. And I really didn't like the characters. The actors did a great job with the material. But there were moments where I ended up scratching my head and wondering where the inappropriate emotion was coming from, or how in the world that choice was made. I will admit that I just lost a near dear one to lung cancer and the hospital scenes were tough to watch. But I don't think that affected my feelings about the characters.

Freeman plays a hard-working, responsible family man, Carter. He's sacrificed his whole life for his family. Nicholson plays the part of a rich playboy, Edward. Edward owns the hospital where Carter is living during cancer treatment. Edward is diagnosed with cancer and ends up as Carter's roommate because Edward is infamous for publicly stating from his soapbox that ""there are no private rooms etc.etc."" Predictably, they hate sharing and each other until treatment and struggles bring them together in a brotherhood of the suffering and dying. They begin a bucket list...""things to do before I kick the bucket."" Actually, Carter does and the items on the list are evidence of his life of responsibility and service. But then Edward and his deep pockets get involved and the adventure is on.

I struggled with Carter's embracing of some of Edward's foolishness. I didn't like Carter's wife which was probably the goal otherwise Carter would have just looked selfish for taking off on the mad adventure around the world. Maybe I've been wrong about things. I always thought that I'd look back and feel that my life made a difference in others' lives because of relationship, not because of my experiences and exploits. Ultimately, that is kind of the end message. But it takes a long, twisted road to get there.",1289952000,,2338,4.709046454767726

Nicholson and Freeman play two elderly men who meet when they unexpectedly find themselves sharing a hospital room, and as they battle cancer.  At first Nicholson can't stand the sight of Freeman, but eventually regards him, and finally comes to like him.  Freeman, on the other hand, can't understand Nicholson, yet befriends him.  They spend dark days together as they battle cancer, going through chemotherapy and operations.

One night Freeman starts to scribble some things down on a piece of paper, which is then cast aside.  Nicholson finds it and discovers that it's a bucket list...things to do before you kick the bucket.  Seemingly on a whim they take off together to complete their bucket list.  They come to know each other better as they trot the globe doing first one thing, and then another.

This an extremely heartwarming tale of friendship and mutual regard.

As the title of the review shows, my wife and I loved this film/story; as senior citizens we found it quite enlightening.  Our problem relates solely to the production of the DVD itself.  At first, I thought the DVD was sold by one of Amazon.com's business partners, but according to the order, it was sold by Amazon.  We found two main problems with the DVD.  First, the actual DVD disk has no imprint that displays the name of the DVD or anything about the film.  It is simply a blank DVD -- blank on top and, of course, blank on the actual playing side.  This is the first time we have purchased a DVD that did not contain some type of imprint on the top face of it.

3025268,4,B000YAF4MA,"At first The Bucket List was something I did not care if I saw or not because I knew the two main characters would die, and I thought it would be depressing.  But while the beginning was slow and frighteningly morbid, the film was actually inspiring and somewhat uplifting.

Can two terminally ill men who are complete strangers with different personalities and backgrounds enjoy an adventure-packed vacation during some of the last months of their lives?  The answer is yes, if you're in the movies where remission, money, and wit can come at the drop of a screenwriter's pen.

Jack Nicholson's character had the money, while Morgan Freeman's character had a lifetime of knowledge; so much so that I wondered why appearing on Jeopardy didn't top the so called bucket list.  But while the extent of their vacation and list of things to do before they ""kicked the bucket"" was extreme, their growing appreciation for one another and effect on each other's lives were realistic enough to make an impact.

And while this movie was not one of Nicholson's funniest, the movie was a real joy to watch.  It will make you think about the value of life, death, family loyalty, and everlasting friendship.

I would like to let you know that if someone had told ME Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman had just made a wonderful film together, I probably would have said, YEAH SURE ! I must confess my thinking was totally wrong ! These two should have both gotten Oscars for the parts they played in the movie. It was fantastic, and I have put it on the upper shelf with Forest Gump, True Women, and Avatar, esc. The thing that impressed me most is the extent of research they did about Cancer, Cancer Patients and Cancer Treatments, not to mention REAL hospital environment and interaction. I should know I am a recovering Cancer patient and am still wondering which would have been worse, the Cancer or the necessary Treatments.  Even if you've never had the privilege, and I would wish it on my worst enemy, it would definately help you understand where a Cancer Patients are coming from.

3025288,4,B000YAF4MA,"""The Bucket List"", starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman is a sometimes funny, sometimes poignant look at two cancer patients who meet when they are both hospitalized in one of Jack Nicholson's hospital.  Nicholson plays Edward Cole, and is rich; Freeman (Carter Chambers) isn't (he's a mechanic).  Chambers is married; Cole is married to his work.  Both are seriously ill, and given months to live.  Chambers starts jotting on a pad, curious about the note, Cole picks it up.  Chambers is not happy, but allows that it is a 'bucket list', i.e. a list of things to do before one dies.

Cole decides to make both of their lists a reality.  First on the list, skydiving.  Then, racing a Mustang 350 race car, Mount Everest and other things.

When the movie came out, the reviews were mixed, and I wasn't that motivated to see it.  However, one came to me, and I watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Both actors do a good job allowing the audience to understand a bit of how it is to face one's last illness.  Both Cole and Chambers grow from knowing one another; the single Cole grows the most.

Jack Nicholson is his usual not-attractive, rumpled, somehow lovable self (reminded me very much of the portrayal he did in his movie Something's Gotta Give with Diane Keaton).  Tommy, the assistant, who puts up with Nicholson's jerky character with aplomb and devotion, brings warmth to Nicholson's character.  It really is a good movie.  I did wonder how the movie would have been if Freeman's and Nicholson's parts had been swapped, a la The Bishop's Wife, with Freeman playing the wealthy man who has everything but not the one thing he wants, and Nicholson playing the warm-hearted, learned man who has given his all and wants a little life for himself.

3025311,5,B000YAF4MA,"Two of my favorite Actors, Morgan Freeman as a retired auto Mechanic and Jack Nicholson get acquainted as terminantly ill cancer patients! The story is the result of Morgan (Charles Chambers) remembering The BUCKET LIST Assignment from his Philosophy Teacher who asked his students to make a list of the things which they would try to accomplish before he ""Kicked The Bucket.""

When Edward Cole found the list begun by his roommate Charles Chambers, they decided that was the best way they could spend their last days! So both asked their Doctors to check them out of their room and their treatment. Since Edward Cole was a wealthy Fortune 500 mogul who owned an interest in hospitals, they chose to attempt their list of things they had never done before. First they wanted to sky dive out of a large plane. They did this and it was a huge thrill! Next they visited Monte Carlo, where they downed great amounts of Caviar and hit the tables. They tore up the road in two supercharged cars in reckless  abandon at great speeds and enormous risks! They visited Africa where they included the beautiful scenery and animals of a Safari! From there they saw the great Egyptian Pyramids. They stayed in famous Hotels in the exotic cities of China & France, etc.

When they returned home, they each celebrated! Edward meeting with his large board of Associates & Directors after he made a difficult, surprise visit, taking flowers to his only estranged daughter after years of silence! Charles met his whole family for a big joint dinner with all of his children & grandchildren!

The crowning scene of the whole story was the celebration of the Memorial Service of Charles' death, where Ed Cole gave the most touching Eulogy ever heard and felt for the man he only had known a few years, yet had given him new desires to stay alive!

Part of Ed & Charles personal touch were the stories they shared! One of the most enduring was the visit that Charles described to a friend after climbing his memorial trip to the top of an ancient Tibetian mountain where he had experienced the most profound silence, so that he felt he heard the Voice of God. The final scene of the Movie was the trip up to the top of that very mountain where he deposited the Urn of Charles' ashes.

3025322,5,B000YAF4MA,"A long time ago, Carter Chambers' philosophy professor suggested that his students compose a ""bucket list,"" a collection of all the things they wanted to do, see and experience in life before they kicked the bucket. But while Carter was trying to define his private dreams and plans, reality intruded. Marriage, children, myriad responsibilities and, ultimately, a 46-year job as an auto mechanic turned his concept of a bucket list into little more than a bittersweet memory of lost opportunities and a mental exercise he occasionally thought about to pass the time. Meanwhile, corporate billionaire Edward Cole never saw a list without a bottom line. He was always too busy making money and building an empire to think about what his deeper needs might be beyond the next big acquisition or cup of gourmet coffee. Then life delivered an urgent and unexpected wake-up call to both of them. Carter and Edward found themselves sharing a hospital room with plenty of time to think about what might happen next--and about how much of that was in their hands. For all their apparent differences, they discovered they had two very important things in common: an unrealized need to come to terms with who they were and the choices they'd made, and a pressing desire to spend the time they had left doing everything they ever wanted to do. So, against doctor's orders and all good sense, these two virtual strangers check themselves out of the hospital and hit the road together for the adventure of a lifetime--from the Taj Mahal to the Serengeti, the finest restaurants to the seediest tattoo parlors, the cockpit of vintage race cars to the open door of a prop plane--with just a sheet of paper and their passion for life to guide them. Adding and crossing items off their list while taking in the grandeur and beauty of the world, they grapple with the difficult questions and the even more difficult answers that plague all of us. And, without even realizing it, become true friends.  This movie is full of well-earned rueful humor. What a gift.

As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!
AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!
I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip as well as to have with me to view so I didn't want anything that would be offensive to anyone near me on the plane.

Yes, it's sad, but so are lots of things in life but this is a different kind of sadness. It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.

I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.

I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.

I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...
Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.

This includes jumping out of an airplane, getting a tattoo, driving a racecar and touring the planet (luckily, one of them is rich enough to own his own jet) - all before ""kicking the bucket.""

Sort of a ""feel-good"" movie about death, Rob Reiner's ""The Bucket List"" pretty much plays out as one would expect it to, with a predictable and episodic script (by Justin Zackham) that wobbles uncomfortably between whistling-past-the-graveyard humor and courage-in-the-face-of-death sentimental uplift (the latter being particularly evident in  Morgan Freeman's stentorian voiceover narration and Marc Shaiman's tinkling-piano score).

Like the solid professionals they are, Freeman and Jack Nicholson both rise above the cliches of their respective stereotypes: Nicholson's of a gruff, billionaire playboy (true typecasting if ever there was any) who's been successful in all areas of his life except where it really counts, that is to say as a loving husband and father; and Freeman's of a stolid, conservative family man who's never learned to just cut loose and enjoy life to the full.  Now, just as they are about to meet their maker, these two polar opposites get a chance to teach one another valuable lessons on how to make the most of what little time remains to them.

But the movie as a whole was funny, very sensitive and heart warming, and Nicholson and Freeman complemented the other in delivering strong performances. The script was well done and the movie pace was quite good, considering what is a rather serious subject matter and in the star's cases, a serious situation.

I recommend it to people who are healthy in particular. We take good health for granted until we find out we have something wrong that stirs us into action or perhaps puts us in the hospital.

Maybe reviewers are too young or maybe they're just so scared of death themselves that they don't know how to react without prejudice to a movie that is, at its core, about just plain dying. Maybe I liked this movie because I am 56 years old and yesterday Tim Russert, only 58, died suddenly. This movie gives people in the second half of our lives hope that we may be given a little time to do what we didn't do and smooth over the rough edges of our lives. Yes, the Nicholson character being so wealthy and the working class Freeman character just happening to luck out and meet the rich guy is contrived. But, really, what in a film is not contrived? Isn't that the core of story-telling: making up or choosing a tale to fit the desired message? All movies have a message or movie makers wouldn't make them. The message here is simple: you're born, you die and hopefully sometime in between you make yourself and others happy. This is a wonderful film.",1252022400,,1122,4.42512077294686
3025345,4,B000YAF4MA,"My 12 year old son and I watched it together and we both, surprisingly, enjoyed it very much!  The first 30 minutes was a bit slow but still held our interest.  The journey that these two new friends took was enjoyable to watch unfold. For me at least, a ""bucket list"" is about self discovery and doing things that one might not think they could or would do.  True, the movie was sad in a way because it dealt with cancer and death.  But more so it was about thinking outside the box and overcoming that comfort zone that we sometimes put ourselves into.  In the end, both men ""lived"" life and were happily united with their families before their demise.

I would rather be ashes than dust!
I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.
The function of man is to live, not to exist.
I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.
I shall use my time.

Jack Nicholson is a very rich and jaded man.  Morgan Freeman is a down-home  mechanic, very intelligent and very family oriented.

While it of course is slightly predictable I do not feel it takes anything away from the movie. It managed to bring a very difficult phase in the two main characters and their families lives to the silverscreen in a very positive manner - and shed a positive spin on the inevitability of growing old and eventually dying. Much like Tuesdays with Morris did both in the book and movie.

A must see - for older people to lift their spirits and incite them to be active and enjoy themselves to the end - and for younger people to remind them to enjoy life and spread happiness to others while they still can.",1243641600,,825,4.15625

The plot proceeded as expected, and Nicholson has seemingly played a variant of fly-be-free unseemly older man goes off-the-rails in at least two other films.  He does it well, of course, but the role is no test of his skill.  Freeman's character experiences and expresses a wider range of feeling and transition, and it is he the audience comes to identify with most.  The message of the film is uplifting, though decidedly more humorous.  At times it seemed to not know if it was a drama or a comedy.

Carter is a scholarly mechanic with a large loving family & wife of 45 years. The movie may skew a bit to the older crowd but anybody can appreciate this movie. Besides, what over-50 guy has not composed a bucket list of sorts, things to do, places to see before death? Both men are given death sentences, months to live. They compose a list. Being asymphtomatic & having all of Ed's money to play with they begin, much to Carter's wife, Virginia's consernation. Beverly Todd cannot be 65 years old. A good looking woman. She wants Carter to die quietly in her arms. They do the things, racing a Cobra Shelby on a course, jumping out of a plane, visiting the pryamids etc. as they fly around the world (Ed has a private jet). It becomes a buddy/road trip. There are challenges that each has problems with such as Carter being faithful to his wife & Ed reconciling with his grown daughter. It is all done with humor & heavy doses of pop-philsophy. I can see director Rob Reiner fingerprints all over the place. It is all pretty entertaining. The ending of the movie is of course pre-ordained. Even that is amusing. Ed's words of wisdom that men over 60 can relate to: ""Always know where the nearest bathroom is, never waste a hard-on & never trust a fart.",1241827200,,1429,4.478927203065134

3025369,4,B000YAF4MA,"Starting out in a hospital, The Bucket List has a sad beginning where two terminally ill men encounter each other. With just months to live, the two men (Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman) see the world together. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson soon begin to make a list of all the things they want to do before they ""kick the bucket"".
Soon after escaping from the cancer ward, the two men set out on their long journey to fulfill the bucket list. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman take a private jet to Egypt. While sitting on an Egyptian pyramid, Morgan Freeman tells Jack Nicholson, ""You know, the ancient Egyptians had a beautiful belief on death. When their souls got to the entrance to heaven, the guards asked two questions. Their answers determined whether they were able to enter or not. Have you found joy in your life? Has your life brought joy to others?"" Throughout the movie, the mood changes constantly. Changing from one sad, touching scene to the next gut-busting scene, The Bucket List is a movie you can not easily walk away from.
 The scenery in The Bucket List was extraordinary. The Bucket List had many changing scenes, and each scene looked just as real as the one before it. When Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are skydiving, the scenery around them looks like they are actually sky diving. Before jumping out of the plane, they do a shot of the ground below them, and it looks like they are actually about to jump out of the plane. Flying through the air in the airplane on their way to another location, Morgan Freeman looked out his plane window and saw all the purple and white clouds. They did an excellent job of making it look like they were actually on an airplane. They also did an excellent job in scenery when Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are sitting on top of a pyramid in Egypt. When they are sitting on the pyramid and looking out into the Egyptian world, it looks like every detail was real, and they were actually there.
The topic of The Bucket List is supposed to be a sad topic, but the way they describe it in the movie makes it a lot less sad. The Bucket List has two men that have brain cancer and are going to die in a couple months. Any person would think that making a movie that has to do with cancer would be sad, but The Bucket List  has the two men meet each other in the hospital and enjoy their last few months together. The way the director approaches the situation makes the movie funny and enjoyable.  I was very impressed by how good of a job the director did of making the movie funny and not sad. The movie has two total strangers spend the last few months of their lives together and become best friends, and it even helped Jack Nicholson ""bring joy to others"".
 The Bucket List was nominated for Best Picture, a Grammy and a Golden Reel Award. After watching The Bucket List, I now see why it was nominated for those awards. The Bucket List has been the best movie I've seen so far. The Bucket List had many memorable quotes, but the quote that caught my attention the most was, ""I know when he died, his eyes were closed and his heart was open"" stated by Morgan Freeman after Jack Nicholson died. I would highly recommend this movie to people. This movie has changed my perspective on living life to the fullest. Even though you may be dying, that shouldn't stop you from having fun and achieving your goals. After seeing The Bucket List, I understand what living life to the fullest means. Jack Nicholson (Edward) and Morgan Freeman (Carter) truly did live their lives to the fullest, especially their last few months of life.

3025385,4,B000YAF4MA,"The movie ""The Bucket List"" depicts the relationship between two men dying of cancer and how their unlikely pairing helps fulfill the unmet needs of the other.  The two men are admitted to the same hospital room.  The corporate millionaire and the scholarly mechanic initially are not at all interested in one another.  Their friendship begins after each receives their diagnosis and therefore has something in common.

The scholarly mechanic begins a ""bucket to do list"" only to crumple it and throw it on the floor.  The corporate millionaire finds it on the floor picks it up and reads it.  He interrogates the scholarly mechanic and proceeds to add to the list.  Soon both men are working together to complete the ""bucket to do list"" before they kick the bucket.  The list varies from ""sky-diving"" to ""kissing the most beautiful woman in the world.""

The Warner Brother Pictures movie features the always irreverent Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole, the corporate millionaire and the perpetually levelheaded Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers, the scholarly mechanic.  Rob Reiner directed the film.

I enjoyed Jack Nicholson's wildness and Morgan Freeman's love of family and learning.  Each has a missing piece in their life the other is destined to fill.  They travel and do what many of us dream of doing.  The most important ""to do"" item in the end is love of family.

You will not want or be able to move for sometime after the movie ends.  Your head will be spinning with thoughts about your own life's ""bucket to do list.""  When your head stops spinning, go the movie's website where you can complete a Facebook Application and create your own list.

One thing you can pretty much count on from the very beginning is to be crying by the time the film reaches its conclusion.  You pretty much KNOW you'll be crying by the end, and that the happiness between the two characters isn't going to stay like that forever.

This unlikely pair become great friends throughout the movie.  They begin developing a 'bucket list' - items that they have always wanted to do before their deaths.  The roster of 'to do' items includes such things as skydiving, driving race cars, visiting the Great Wall of China, laughing until you cry, and viewing something truly majestic.

3025391,5,B000YAF4MA,"What the devil was I thinking?  When Rob Reiner's THE BUCKET LIST first appeared in theaters, I passed.  I saw the trailers--two old coots kicking up their heels before cashing in their chips--and thought the film looked too contrived and superficial.  Well, I caught the ending of the movie on cable recently, then couldn't wait to view it again, which I did (several times).  This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and I've seen some intense movers and shakers.

It's a given when a film features talent like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman you are going to get excellent performances.  And both actors deliver:  Freeman as a lifelong mechanic whose true ambitions were thwarted by circumstances; the irascible Nicholson as a curmudgeonly tycoon.  Both characters are suddenly thrown together by terminal illnesses, yet through all the turmoil and heartache a fast friendship develops.  The friction between them as they first meet, the adventures they share as they go through their respective ""Bucket Lists"", make up the movie's most comedic scenes.  The skydiving scene, in particular, was very effective for me, as it was readily apparent both Freeman and Nicholson were actually freefalling through the air during the scene.

The actors themselves could have kicked the bucket.

Yet the ending was what moved me the most.  Because we as the audience have developed an attachment to the characters, it becomes very difficult to watch as they meet their respective fates.  The interaction between the two in the end--the total and complete way each man has made a change, for the better, in his friend's life--makes for one incredibly poignant climax.  THE BUCKET LIST covers the full range of emotions; easily one of the best bittersweet movies in many years.  Highly recommended.

Still, as a film it's not very memorable.  I saw it a week ago and I'm just remembering that I watched it and needed to post a review.  Nicholson is Nicholson and of course Morgan Freeman is narrating. (If it ain't broke then don't fix it, eh?) Overall, it's just okay.",1230422400,,436,4.204819277108434
3025393,5,B000YAF4MA,"Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson, need I say more? In the beginning we're introduced the sweet voice of Morgan Freeman narrating while shots of the Himalayas flash on screen. We see a lonely climber who will also be at the end of the film.

  Freeman is absolutely outstanding as Carter Chambers. Carter is a mechanic who for 45 years has greased up his arms working to give his children and wife. Nicholson is a rich tyrant named Edward Cole who's only joy in life it seems is to make money and cause hell to the people around him. Yet, they meet up in Cole's hospital, both being treated for cancer. One night Carter creates a ""Bucket List"", yet throws it on the floor. Cole picks up and Carter tells him the story of how his Freshman Philosophy teacher asked them to make a ""Bucket List""; Things they wanted to do before they died. Ironic how it comes into play now? So funded by Cole's millions and both of their desires to do more before their deaths, they go on the adventure. Skydiving, racing sports cars, going to France, and going on an African safari are among some of the things they do. And to keep from potential spoilers, I'll stop here.
  Overall ""The Bucket List"" isn't a movie in the traditional sense, you take a lot more away from it than your average run of the mill comedy/drama. It's tearful (dealing with death is never easy), it's inspiring, and perhaps at times a little tacky. However it's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",1230076800,,1467,4.479400749063671

3025395,5,B000YAF4MA,"We probably all theoretically have that list of things that we all hope to accomplish before we meet our fateful end here on Earth. Whether the list include tangible sort of goals like run a marathon or climb a mountain or somewhat more intangible things like being a better person or contributing to society, the reason as to why we might choose to list such items is to sort of set some goals in the life that passes us by so quickly.

Often times we might not take seriously the list of things to achieve until it is too late. We might be caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life that removes our focus from what might be a priority and what might not be. There are times when we might fail to start addressing the things that might be classified as goals until ""everything else"" is done.

Directed by Rob Reiner, The Bucket List is a humorous yet somewhat philosophical film that maybe even for just a few seconds reminds us that maybe there is more to life than just the rigmarole of our professional lives. In a society that is driven by numbers, results and expectations, a failure to step back every now and again could indeed push each of us to our passing in a more expeditious manner.

The Bucket List gets its name because it is one man's listing of things that he hopes to accomplish before he kicks the bucket.

Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a mechanic by trade but perhaps a professor by knowledge and action. Carter seems to know just about every fact there is to know about just about everything. A Jeopardy wizard, Carter is satisfied with his life as a mechanic but cannot help but wonder if decisions that he made perhaps could have forever changed the life that he lives.

One day while working in his shop, Carter comes out to find that he has terminal cancer and likely does not have much time left to live. Though he has sort of found his peace with the diagnosis, Carter does try some experimental cancer treatment in an attempt to give not just himself but his family some more time.

By matter of circumstance, Carter ends up becoming hospital roommate with Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) who is, interestingly enough, the owner of the hospital where the two are staying. Edward has made his fortune in the health care industry owning and operating hospitals. His business approach to health care has always been more about the dollars and cents more than it has been about providing quality health care.

But when Edward comes to find out that he too is on a quick path to death due to a cancer diagnosis, as well, Edward finds a new perspective on life. His friendship with Carter is a unique and interesting one that at times is about nothing more than playing gin while at other times it is all about personal and emotional issues the two might be sharing.

Sean Hayes plays the role of Thomas, who is Edward's right hand man and does it remarkably well. There is the right level of cynicism directed back at the boss that truly makes the dynamic between the two shine.
Needless to say, the two friends each start to look at the things that are on their joint bucket list and wonder whether or not they will be able to accomplish many of them before they pass. As the absurdity of some of the tasks grows so does their friendship that really was like a phoenix that rose from the ashes of being nothing more than hospital roommates.

What makes The Bucket List such an enjoyable film is really the message that it gets across. Though certainly it is meant to be watched partially as a comedy, there is also the right amount of a sort of deeper meaning to the film that makes it a complete film. Freeman and Nicholson are the ideal actors for the parts that they were cast for and it is clear to see why they were chosen.

The Bucket List is an amazingly well done film that is certainly worth while to add to your own bucket list of movies to watch. After all, it could help to shed some perspective as to your own daily living.",1229472000,,3974,4.431506849315069
3025396,5,B000YAF4MA,"This is by far the best movie of the year. Heartwarming, funny and serious all at the same time. The interaction between Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is as classic as Paul Newman and Robert Redford. This is a must see.",1229040000,,223,4.463414634146342
3025397,1,B000YAF4MA,"The new Jack Nicholson & Morgan Freeman buddy picture is downright depressing. Indeed, the Warner Brothers' trailer for ""The Bucket List"" made it look like a hilarious combination of ""Grumpy Old Men"" meet ""Odd Couple"" in a cancer ward. The Oscar-winning actors play an Abbott & Costello pair of charismatic cut-ups with cancer. Unfortunately, this warm fuzzy frolic about two terminally-ill old-times that tear off for one final fling is predictable, preposterous, and ultimately pathetic. This is the kind of movie that would make a hospice nurse snicker out of one corner of his or her mouth. No disrespect intended to hospice nurses.

Our elderly heroes loiter for the first thirty minutes in a hospital, the next thirty on a round-the-world, fun-in-the-sun, travelogue thrill ride, and the last thirty minutes taking forever to die. Ironically, billionaire hospital magnate Edward Cork (paunchy Jack Nicholson of ""Anger Management"") has never been sick a day in his life. He parlayed his fortune out of privatizing health care facilities. Two beds for each room, he stipulates early in the opening scene, he doesn't operate health spas. No sooner has Cork declared this dictum than he lands in one of his own hospitals with six months to live. When he awakens, Cork demands a private room. Not possible, his right-hand man Thomas (Sean Hayes of TV's ""Will & Grace"") admonishes him. Cork's choice of a private room, Thomas points out, would undermine Cork's own dictum about low-cost hospital facilities. Thankfully, Jack Nicholson doesn't moon us like Tom Hanks did in ""Charlie Wilson's War."" Of course, what movie about chemo patients would be complete without the star in his hospital gown puking in a toilet?

Auto mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven"") suspects that he has his own tumor when he discards his last cigarette. Unlike the quadruple divorced Cork, Chambers has been happily married to his high school sweetheart for 45 years with two financially successful grown-up sons and a daughter. The boys have made him a grandfather while his daughter has become a world-class violinist.

Cork and Carter wind up in the same room but they aren't made for each other. One day, Carter scribbles out an inventory of activities on a yellow pad he'd like to do before he kicks the bucket. Generously, Cork offers to foot the bill for their adrenalin-laced adventures. Our heroes behave like overgrown adolescents. They parachute from planes, careen around in race cars, climb the Great Pyramids, and motorcycle the length of the Great Wall of China. Lastly, they share the laugh of their lives when they discover Cork's premium coffee derives its unique flavor from the digestive tract of an exotic tree cat that feeds on them.

Nicholson and Freeman together aren't enough to redeem freshman writer Justin Zackman's contrived clowning about friendship, death, and dying. We're none the wiser for watching this platitudinous pabulum. ""The Bucket List"" qualifies as another loser from director Rob Reiner who once made good movies such as ""When Harry Meet Sally,"" ""The Sure Thing,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""The Princess Bride."" Lately, he has been dishing up dreck like ""North,"" ""The Ghosts of Mississippi,"" ""The Story of Us,"" ""Alex and Emma,"" and ""Rumor Has It.""

The tear-jerking titans that Nicholson and Freeman play possess far too much stamina and energy as former chemotherapy patients to perform their daring feats. The skydiving scenes are the genuine item,with Nicholson and Freeman clearly in the air above th earth, but the racing scenes suffer from obvious back-projection footage. What? They could sky dive from several thousand feet for real, but they cannot drive like hellions for a quarter of a mile?

Make ""The Bucket List"" the last movie you ever see!",1228608000,12,3791,5.12621359223301
3025398,4,B000YAF4MA,"'Approaching the 50 mark myself, 'The Bucket List' is one of those films that makes you think. Hopefully I'll be around a long, long time, but you just never know. This is an enjoyable movie with a more than capable cast especially in the two leads. I can watch these guys in just about anything, and Freeman could recite the phone book and I would listen.

The movie is kept on a comedic level through most of the story, probably because we would be crying all the way through this film if it weren't! Believe me you will shed a tear before it ends, but through the middle of the film, I found a lot of the ""Bucket List"" ""high jinks"" to be rather artificial at times. The second half of the film is much better and it is also where it redeems itself. It's a good film with great actors that will hold your interest, but it's far from perfect. The DVD transfer is very good, the extra material is very sparse.",1228521600,,909,4.254335260115607
3025399,5,B000YAF4MA,"Simply put, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It's a movie to make one think, make one review life, and; yes, make one cry.  My husband and I had been hesitant to view this film because it had received such negative reviews.  Finally today I decided to watch 'Bucket List' because I knew, deep down, Morgan Freeman would not make 'junk'.  I was right.

This isn't a movie for kids, this isn't a movie for teens, nor most people in their 20's.  This is a movie for the more mature of us, the people who know life WILL have an end, the people who know the disappointment of unfulfilled dreams.  This is a movie to cry over, and to laugh over.

3025402,3,B000YAF4MA,"As a long-time fan of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, I expected to see some strong performances from these two great actors.  Although they didn't live up to some of their earlier great roles, neither were they disappointing.  Both did yeoman's work in their roles as aging men from very different life backgrounds, one phenomenally rich and the other a humble laborer, who found common ground in their battle with terminal cancer.  Both are forced, without regard to wealth or social status, to come to grips with both their own mortality and their past failings.

The first half hour or so of the movie was less than gripping, and at times maybe even a little tedious, but once it moves into the meat of the storyline it takes on a new life (although even at this it seems a bit too contrived and just missed a fourth star).  In their quest to live full lives in their last remaining months, and thus to try to undo a lifetime of squandered opportunities, they stumble upon something far more valuable -- true self-understanding, true friendship, and, most importantly, redemption.

I hate spoilers, so I won't give any clues except to say that the end of this frequently humorous, frequently poignant tale is delightfully unexpected and equally poetic.  This is not a great movie, but I would characterize it as a good one that will, or at least should, prompt each viewer to stop and think about his or her own approach to life, and to pursue the most important things while there's still time.",1226275200,,1502,4.709923664122138

3025411,5,B000YAF4MA,"I will admit, I did hesitate to watch this movie given all the hype and publicity. I finally broke down and rented it and I'm so glad I did.
I've read some other reviews and agree with some of them.
But, what I got out of this movie goes a lot deeper.
This movie speaks to me of the ties in human nature. The ties to family, to our work, our identity, our ideals, our religion and even to strangers. There are countless ties that bind us each and every moment of every day. How tight the tie is depends on the moment, the situation, other who are present.
In this movie, the main characters loosen their ties and focus on themselves. They set out to accomplish things they wish they had done in their life....before their death.
This movie also shows how reaching a dream isn't done alone. Whether we think about it or not, we do not live alone in this world. However, how much consideration do we often have toward each other? Even those who are 'invisible' to us most of the time?
I can't begin to tell you how deep you can go with the thoughts provoked in this movie. But I will tell you this. If you see only one movie to shake the cobwebs out of your brain and make you aware of 'Life'... this should be it.
Cudos to Rob Reiner and all that went into this movie. Definiely a classic.",1222300800,,1288,4.19758064516129
3025412,4,B000YAF4MA,"MY name is Lim, Dr. Michael Lim and I am The Travelling Gourmet. I saw this movie sitting in Business Class on an Emirates flight to DUBAI. The flight was smooth, the food was fabulous, the flight stewardesses were courteous and good looking. However, the icing on the cake that made the flight perfect was this movie. It is a movie about death, for we all die once we are born. I calculated once how many minutes a person has if he or she lives for 100 years. It is not a lot if you make the calculation yourself.
The story is simple. Morgan Freeman has a list of what you want to do before 'you kick the bucket', hence the title: The Bucket List. Jack Nicholson, one of my favourite actors, just like Emirates is one of may favourite airlines, is superb in his wise cracking role of a man who has just months to live. He has the money to make Morgan Freeman's hypothetical 'bucket list' a reality. He says at one point, 'Money, that's all I got'
So the two buddies go and do all the things they wanted to do but never did and for them as for all of us, time really is running out.
I used to parachute and the parachuting scene is hilarious and it really looks like Jack did the tandem jump, unless CGI is so good nowadays that it can fool me. The movie insurance premium on Jack must have been huge.
They race fast cars like pro drivers and Jack even tries to set up Morgan with a beautiful, intelligent fille de joie, but Morgan, good guy that he is, politely declines. That shows there are those who still keep to their principles, no matter what. Something I always admire in a person.
Morgan's wife is enraged that he is spending his last hours with a new found friend instead of with his family.
Jack's performance is outstanding as it was to in 'Something's gotta give'. He is physically ugly but boy, he sure can act! And his charisma and screen presence c'est formidable!!!
See this movie and laugh and maybe, just maybe, make your own bucket list to do. Time and tide wait for no man.

3025413,4,B000YAF4MA,"This is one of those movies that the public enjoys much more than the professional movie watching people. Roger Ebert, for example, delivers a heated diatribe on the liberties taken in Bucket List, particularly with respect to the realities of having cancer, a subject the esteemed critic has experienced first-hand. Ebert's anger, however, seems more connected with his own personal trauma than he acknowledges. I, for one, don't hold movies up to that kind of litmus test. It's more about how much the film gets inside you, makes you feel, engages you and keeps you watching for more as the story unfolds. Reiner's film does all those things here, at least for me. While it is admittedly formulaic to pit the wise, quiet, gentle and all-giving soul (Freeman) against the narcissistic, shallow, in-your-face, yet ultimately loveable character which Nicholson can pretty much phone in by this time, at the end of the day, IT WORKS. Good drama often involves the tempering of opposites and The Bucket List is no expection. We watch with satisfaction as these two extremely different men move toward their expected and imminent deaths, willing to break out of their lives as they've lived them so far, each allowing change to occur through the influence of the other. Much of it is just fun, Hollywoodish entertainment, but there is depth there as well. When I got up from watching this movie, I was aware of it having gotten inside me; I felt an openness and gratitude for my own life and those in it. And whereas I certainly can't credit The Bucket List for the having the ability to evoke that response in everyone who watches it, I do recommend it as entertainment, a few laughs and the occasional kleenex.

3025429,4,B000YAF4MA,"It's really virtually impossible not to like a movie with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in it.. they add a sense of gravitas to anything they are in - and there is pleasure to be had in watching their contrasting styles spark off each other.
Here, the play two men, both suffering from cancer, sharing a room at a hospital (in a rather contrived set up).  After some preamble to fleetingly show that they are actually not well, they create a bucket list - a list of things they want to do before kicking the bucket, and since one of them is rich, set out to work their way through the items, learning about themselves and each other as they go.
It works because the leads are strong, particularly Freeman.  Nicholson overplays, but then the writing does call for it.  It does stumble however in the script department from time to time... For example, Freeman talking to Nicholson - ""You once said you're not everyone. Well, that's true-you're certainly not everyone, but everyone is everyone.""  It's not exactly Shakespeare.  The concept of terminally ill men skydiving, climbing mountains and traveling the world somewhat while barely catching their breath also stretches credibility.  Morgan Freeman does his trademark stately voice over, which only serves to remind you of The Shawshank Redemption, and the comparison is not favourable.  And while the male bonding is fun to watch and some of the one-liners funny, the warmth of affection Freeman narrates for the Nicholson character never seems quite justified by anything his character does.
Those quibbles aside, it's fun, warm and fuzzy round the edges, has some decent performances, and is short enough not to outlast its welcome.  Not a classic, but thumbs up nonetheless.",1218672000,,1735,4.958620689655173

3025431,4,B000YAF4MA,"This is truly one of those Sunday afternoon feel good kind of movies. Two terminal cancer patients find themselves thrown together by a hospital policy of two beds to every room, no matter what. Oddly enough Edward Cole is the business tycoon who for years preached the ""We run hospitals not day spas"" policy that is until he was the patient at his very on hospital. Then he demanded a private room, to which his assistant Tommy (who real name is Matthew lol) told him would be a PR nightmare so he has to settle with being roomies with Carter. Carter is an all around family man/mechanic, whom gave up on his dream of being a history teacher to make sure his children never wanted for anything. During the year he attended college his professor had them create a ""bucket list"" which essential is a list of things that you want to do before you kick the bucket aka die. Once Carter was given his test results he throws his list which Edward finds, thus leads to the adventures of Edward and Carter, setting out to complete their bucket list. This isn't some thought provoking heart tugging film, but as previously stated it's a feel good movie, that shows that someone rich ole fogy can help a complete stranger for the good.",1218499200,,1225,4.5225225225225225
3025432,4,B000YAF4MA,"Let me ask you a question, if you could know the date or at least the approximate time frame of when you were going to die, would you want to? If you did choose to find out, would you live out the remainder of your days in fear of that final moment, or regretting things you may or may not have had the chance to do? On the other hand, would you take whatever time you were allotted to do your best to live your life to its fullest potential? That is a question, and is essentially the basic theme, that is presented in the new comedy/drama ""The Bucket List"" starring Morgan Freeman (""The Dark Knight"") and Jack Nicholson (""The Departed"").

""The Bucket List"" is the story of two complete strangers, one is a cantankerous billionaire named Edward (Jack Nicholson), and the other is a very kind and wise mechanic named Carter (Morgan Freeman), who find themselves in the same depressing situation when they discover they both have the same prognosis... cancer. Rather than letting this sort of news send them headlong into the depths of depression, these two men embark on an inspiring journey to see and experience many of the world's greatest sights and adventures; showing to everyone around them that just because your time is short, that does not mean your life is over already.

Director Rob Reiner (""A Few Good Men""), along with writer Justin Zackham, have done a very good job of balancing an incredibly serious subject matter that hits close to home for many viewers, while at the same time injecting the story with a hefty dose of humor to lift the mood of the film. For some, mixing such a serious subject with comedy may seem offensive or disrespectful, but the story never becomes so humorous that the primary subject ever becomes watered down or treated lightly. I also like that along with the very well-written story, the movie poses some thought-provoking questions that will cause you to think about whether you would like to know when or how you will die, and what exactly you would do with that knowledge. It is always nice when a movie is willing to become a little more than just entertainment and good storytelling, allowing itself to create some form of discussion over its subject matter or themes.

Regarding the stars of the film, it's not surprising that the two lead actors do a terrific job, after all both are veterans of the film business, and their performances have never once disappointed me in any film. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were the absolute perfect choices to play these two characters; and through their growing friendship, respect for each other, and the realistic problems and challenges they must face, along with the cleverly written dialogue, we are effectively drawn into their lives, easily relating to and becoming emotionally invested in them. Actor Sean Hayes, best known for TV's ""Will and Grace"", is the witness to the inspiring adventure these newfound friends embark upon, and his own sarcasm fits in perfectly with Edward's sardonic nature and Carter's keen intellect and quick wit. Every member of the cast did an excellent job of gracefully moving back and forth between the serious nature of the disease plaguing the two leads' lives and the humorous moments spread throughout the film, never once failing to appropriately portray either side of the situation.

""The Bucket List"" is the perfect example of what has been dubbed a dramedy by many people; it's a mixture of a drama and comedy, never becoming solely one or the other. The cast is perfect, giving the characters a depth and realism that is needed for a film such as this; the script is well-written and crafted to perfectly balance the gravity of the situation with some light-hearted humor. Overall, this is just a really good movie that will undoubtedly hit closer to home for some more than others, but it still should be seen, as it is an inspiring example of not letting your life's circumstances, grave or otherwise, get the best of you.

""The Bucket List"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexuality and violence.",1218240000,,4048,4.785407725321888

3025435,5,B000YAF4MA,"Finally, a warm and wholesome movie you can watch with your family.  The Bucket List brings together two noble actors, and their opposite life experiences juxtaposed on their common destiny (a diagnosis of cancer with 6 months to live).  Ed Cole, mega-rich egotistical and lonely executive and Carter Chambers, a gifted but humble blue-collar family man with faith meet in a common hospital room and bond while recovering from surgeries and going through chemotherapy.  When they both learn of their common fate, they decide to do everything they always wanted to do before it is too late.  What starts off as a rip-roaring adventure with comic moments ends when each man ""crosses the line"" by setting up a situation that the other one is uncomfortable with.  However at the same time, both men are healed from the emotional problems that they had in their personal lives, having taught each other a lesson that there are people and relationships more important than just adventure, experiences and fun.  Finally Cole cared about someone other than himself, and Carter gets to laugh so hard until he cries.  Even though the ending is sad, because of the cancer, the story is uplifting, as both men transcend their previous existence, in the final moments of life, in having helped a perfect stranger (each other):  Carter loses his bitterness and Cole his self-centeredness.",1217894400,,1374,5.022026431718062

Enjoy your life, be kind to others, bring joy to others.  Don't be a sourpuss.  Appreciate things. Be thankful and grateful in this world.  Be kind, be courteous. Life is too short to be a putz.

No matter what I think of any of the movies they were in, I have never been unimpressed by these two actors, and when The Bucket List was released, I knew that it would end up in my DVD collection.

The movie is funny, introspective (especially if you're in that 45-60 age group), and enlightening (especially if you're in that 20-35 age group).

45-60 - Do you have a bucket list? Get to work on it. Now!

3025443,5,B000YAF4MA,"Great 'must see' movie!  Before watching this with me, my 13-year-old son said ""But this is an old people's movie""; his mind quickly changed when this DVD filled our TV screen.  Edward (Nicholson) and Carter (Freeman) are cancer patients sharing a hospital room when they both get the news that they each have only six months to a year to live.  Although the movie shows how these men choose to cope with death, the theme is definitely living life to the fullest and finding joy along the way.

The two write a 'Bucket List' of things they want to do before they kick the bucket.  It includes things like getting a tattoo and kissing the most beautiful girl in the world.  Both actor shine in this movie, so much so that I'd place a hefty cash bet on this winning some serious awards.

Nicholson is fantastic in this, he is much like his character in Term of Enderment, he is at times funny and at time heart breaking.  Freeman gets the less showing part, but as always he is solid and thoroughly likeable.  Sean Hayes does a predictable turn as Nicholsons assistant, but he is good none the less.  I read reviews of this film when it came out and most were less than glowing, so I was reluctant to get the DVD..that was a mistake, not only did I enjoy this movie to the utmost, but I plan to watch it several more times..if for no other reason than to watch the amazing cinemaphotography that opens the film and to listen to John Mayers perfect ""Say"", that ends the film.",1217203200,,845,4.391025641025641

Both happen to share a hospital room and both have terminal cancer with just months to live.

When Edward Cole (who has billions and wants to spend it) was trying to convince Carter Chamberlain to take the time they had in remission to do things on the bucket list, he compared how fast the last 45 years of his life had went and how fast the coming months would go by.  Edward asked Carter if he rather go home to his family and have them adjust their lives and routines around his disease or celebrate what time was left?

Anyway, I enjoyed it, definitely worth renting.  Great performances, could have had a deeper plot though.

And I have to mention, the video quality was excellent, didn't notice any hiccups in the playing of the movie.  Amazon has done a great job.  And I didn't have to spend any money on gas to rent this movie (a definite plus!).",1216771200,,712,4.519685039370079
3025453,3,B000YAF4MA,"This is a generic buddy movie but unlike Curtis and Poitier in The Defiant Ones, Nicholson and Freeman are chained together metaphorically: both have only a short time to live and both are seeking some kind of meaning before their hearts cease beating.  The conceit is simple, the script is undemanding and the plot line unfolds pretty much exactly as you'd expect, with chippy dialog and set-piece dramatic moments, not to mention the inevitable ""meaning of life"" schticks that recur with monotonous regularity.

What makes it worth watching (aside from the gorgeous travelog visuals) is that Nicholson truly acts for a moment, near the very end, during the funeral oration.  He's a star who has spent so much of his career mugging to camera that it's a real joy to see him doing more, and actually doing it successfully.

Furthermore there's a scene that is unintentionally comic: about one-third into the movie when the two protagonists are in their shared hospital room deep in a discussion about life, the continuity goes to hell as Freeman's spectacles alternately appear and disappear from his face as shot follows shot.  Clearly the director hoped no one would notice and forewent the expense of re-shooting the scene.  This unintended comic effect has the additional virtue of distracting from the leaden dialog, so it's wholly a plus point.

All in all, this is just another Hollywood mechanically-cranked-out product but it's pleasantly distracting and essentially harmless and (mirabilis dictu) there isn't a firearm in sight.",1216684800,,1538,5.152610441767068

3025457,4,B000YAF4MA,"Although older people or those that have known someone with a terminal illness may have more appreciation for this movie, most people should enjoy it. Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole, and Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers give great performances as men who are already past midlife and appreciating their waning years. Edward as a captain of industry, and Carter as a father and trivia buff. When they both find themselves next to each other in the hospital with cancer and a few months to live, both their lives change. The greatest change is for Edward. The movie is not to preachy but it shows us some of realism of being terminally ill with cancer. We see the impact it has on each man in his own way.

For the fun of it Carter had started to create a ""Bucket List"" based on a class he had taken discussing what they wanted to do before they die. Carter throws it away when he learns of his final fast approaching fate. Edward finds it and decides it's the best course of action for them to have one last fling of life before they die. The rest the movie we see them travelling around the world, racing cars, and skydiving. The conclusion of the movie we see they go their separate ways with different priorities but then meeting again in a dramatic way when one is near death. The message given is a good one for anyone that has a family or friends they have alienated. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.

3025466,3,B000YAF4MA,"Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman deliver excellent performances in a difficult movie. The two men, Edward Cole (Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Freeman), polar opposites of each other, find themselves dying in the same hospital room. Given six months or so to live, the two set out to do... something. They never really saw the idea the same way, or articulated its meaning. There were some touching moments, some great exchanges, but the film felt mediocre.

Somehow, every movie that attempts to lecture on the richness of life or the lessons of the dying winds up being stale. They can make for decent books (see Tuesdays with Morrie), but most movies never shake that moralist tone and lack of plot. At least Tuesdays with Morrie had viable points and lessons to teach; the closest the Bucket List came was Nicholson's character's advice on old age: ""Never pass up a bathroom, never waste a hard-on, and never trust a fart."" And that's pretty much the tone that Edward Cole held throughout the movie. Obnoxious. That was one of the major let-downs; the movie was supposed to be about his redemption, but we only barely tasted it.

As far as acting went, I thought Freeman was excellent as usual, especially in his narration, but perhaps too attached to his usual gentle/sombre/dignified old man persona. 4.5 stars for him. Nicholson's performance seemed to me to be average, not worthy of the great reputation he's built. His patterns of inflection never changed; 2.5 stars there, although understand his character wasn't likable at all.

The side character Thomas, Cole's assistant, was a foil to his boss in two ways: first, his delivery was twice as good as Nicholson's, and second, he was twice as likable. Kudos.

All in all, mediocrity barely lifted by star power. The plot seemed forced, the characters unsatisfying, and the idea wasted. All hail Morgan Freeman, but... this film is barely even worth renting. 2.75 stars",1216080000,,1932,4.953703703703703

What were they expecting, ""Hamlet""?!  Nicholson and Freeman are in their golden years and this is the perfect vehicle for the both them.

Another pleasant surprise was the guy who played Jack on Will & Grace had a decent part in this movie and he played it well. (I was not a huge fan of his before this movie.) I would recommend this if you like sentimental movies with some humor thrown in.

Even if you hated one (or even all) of these, there's still a good chance you'll love Bucket List.  This movie is full of beautiful scenery, hilarity, and true friendship - complete with very real life-questions, and great honesty.  While the situation is not a common one, the characters, their problems, hurts, and joys ring very true.

The old ""You'll laugh.  You'll cry."" fits well, in this case, but you're pretty sure to laugh a lot more than you cry.  You'll also find yourself recalling, and probably quoting lines from it for months to come.

Even the last line of the film is memorable, and funny, and a perfect fit with everything that went before.  This is one movie that is everything that was claimed for it, and much more.

3025500,4,B000YAF4MA,"Based on previews and coming attractions, ""The Bucket List"" was a movie that held no interest for me.  Sure, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are good actors.  Sure, Rob Reiner has directed at least a dozen other movies that I've liked a lot.  But the premise of ""The Bucket List""  sounded weird and unappealing.  This movie is proof that an excellent cast and a skillful director can turn straw into, if not exactly gold, maybe stainless steel.  The movie certainly exceeded my expectations.

Two men with nothing in common except cancer and chemotherapy meet while sharing a hospital room.  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a family man who has been married for 45 years.  He has a loving family, an insatiable intellect and the soul of a philosopher.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) has been divorced four times, is estranged from his only child, has no friends and is accompanied everywhere by a paid personal assistant.  His lifelong talent and passion has been for business and making money; he's a billionaire.

As an academic exercise Carter starts a list of things he'd like to do before he dies.  Edward, picks up the discarded list and is immediately intrigued.  So, with unlimited funding from Jack, the two set off to do all the things they wanted to do... intended to do.... someday.... before 45 years blew past ""like smoke through a keyhole.""

Sean Hayes is terrific as Edward's assistant, Thomas.  I always found him annoyingly over-the-top on ""Will and Grace.""  Here he proves that he can be more charming and much more funny when he dials it down a few notches.

The DVD special features are limited; a brief featurette - ""Writing a Bucket List"" and a John Mayer Music Video 'Say'.  You can insert the DVD into your PC's disk drive more additional special features - something that always seems more trouble than it's worth.  There is no commentary track.

""The Bucket List"" isn't a raucous comedy.  The premise sounds grim but there is humor throughout the film - low key, subtle and thoughtful.  I give it 3 1/2 stars for being better than it had any right to be considering the material.",1214697600,2,2111,4.7707182320441985

Jack is a man without faith whereas Morgan's life is centered on his faith.  They meet in a hospital room where they find out that their days are numbered.

Ikiru is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, never fails to bring tears to my eyes and there are a few quite sarcastic moments and ironic humor in the film, as well. What is more remarkable is ""Ikiru"" was released in 1952 and there is not one truth that was expressed 56 years ago that seems at all archaic or inaccurate in, or irrelevant to, our world today.

No, ""Ikuri"" has not got the Hollywood look and feel and yes, you are either required to read, or are better off reading, the subtitles (very well done in the Criterion Collection edition). But seeing it once, you will remember it for a very long time and feel compelled to revisit it again, at times when life seems to lose its shine and inspiration.

3025505,3,B000YAF4MA,"I approached this movie with minimal expectations, given the number of reviews I had read that trashed it.  This is no masterpiece, but not a terrible flick.  Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play characters who have little in common, save for the fact that they each have diagnoses of terminal cancer. To pack as much life as possible into their limited time, they collaborate in writing a ""Bucket List,"" a to-do list of things to do before they die:  skydiving, car-racing, world travel, etc.  In the end, the Grim Reaper wins out but not before the characters find meaning in their lives.

Of course, such an endeavor is facilitated if you leave your family or have a multimillionaire buddy and a private jet to bankroll such a quest.  You must suspend your disbelief for much of this movie.  For example, Nicholson's character has his head shaved but is in the hospital long enough for his hair to grown back.  What kind of HMO is he on?  The movie's end is somewhat of a formulaic tearjerker, so have some Kleenex on hand.

In the end,  we are all terminal.  We do not know if we have days or decades left to live.  Perhaps this movie will inspire viewers to compose their own ""Bucket List"" and get busy living their dreams.  Not a masterpiece, but not a bad movie either.",1214438400,,1278,4.548245614035087

3025512,4,B000YAF4MA,"The '07 release `The Bucket List' is one of those films that become more meaningful the older you are. A young audience will for the most part find this to be silly, irrelevent and unrelated to where they are at the present time in life, while the older, fifty-five plus viewer (like myself) will view this as a wake-up call and cause one to re-evaluate what one deems important and worthwhile. This film is truly a reflection of real life, the young unconcerned with the inevitable and the questions it posits, the aging begrudgingly accepting and learning to deal with the allotment of time remaining.

Yes this is a film designed to draw a specific audience and stars two of Hollywood's most respected senior actors to attract that target group. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are superb and play off each others strengths magnificently. If you're looking for something a little bittersweet and thoughtful populated with some of the most breathtaking scenic landscapes on the planet why not give this one a try.

3025514,5,B000YAF4MA,"I don't give five stars very often, but this movie deserves every one. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are top-notch in this film, as are the other actors, the directing, the cinematography, and the incredibly excellent script.

The basic story: Two men meet in a hospital room as they are being treated for cancer. They both find out the same day that they only have six months to a year to live. They make a list of things they want to do before they die, and set out to do them. In the process, the true gold in this film is illuminated. It isn't in the things the two men do, but is in the developing relationship between the two men, and especially what happens with Jack Nicholson's character. There is even a touch of the mystical that sneaks up on you at the end.

I won't say any more, because I don't want to spoil anything. Just see the movie. Though it isn't one you can get up and walk away from to get a snack. Everything is needed in this film to tell the story. And again, I cannot state strongly enough how incredibly excellent the script is. The dialog is wonderful without ever striking a false note. The story is completely believable, and never once do you think that something isn't plausible, or that something doesn't sit right.

I was a bit worried that this movie would be maudlin and/or depressing and/or incredibly sad, but it isn't. This movie is instead an affirmation of life. There are laugh-out-loud moments (again, fabulously excellent dialog!), and there are some moments when I cried--sometimes not because something bad happened, but because something wonderful did. I am very happy I saw this movie, and hope you will be too.",1213833600,,1665,4.580536912751678
3025515,4,B000YAF4MA,"If my memory serves me right, this was billed as a comedy in the theaters. Shame because those seeking a funny, light-hearted movie were vastly disappointed. This is, by all accounts, a rather serious film with a few funny moments intertwined. Jack Nicholson is very good at playing the self-absorbed millionaire who finally gets a heart and Morgan Freeman does a great job of finding meaning in life wherever and whenever he can. Many have complained about the film's lack of real adventure--especially when it comes to the scenes from far away lands--but I have to admit that I am glad that wasn't the main focus; otherwise, it would have become a rather shallow film. Instead, this is a deep philosophical film, in the lightest manner possible, about the lives we live. When we come to the end of our journey, it's not the riches we obtain or the material wealth we've acquired that will matter, it's who we are, what we've done, and what we'll leave behind that will matter most. And that's a lesson Nicholson's character will take with him to the grave. As for Freeman, he was reminded that his life wasn't a failure simply because he didn't live his dream as a college professor but was indeed a success because of the legacy he'll be leaving behind--in his family.",1213833600,,1271,4.7040358744394615

The chief problem is that Justin Zackham's debut big-screen screenplay is predicated on so many live-before-dying clichs that the entire venture doesn't feel honest despite the star presence of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Zackham's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is much too manipulative to be affecting, and the roles he provides the two veteran actors don't allow them to leverage their talents to build believable characters. Can you tell I didn't like the movie much?

The plot concerns itself with pompous health-care billionaire Edward Cole, who finds himself in his own hospital sharing a room with trivia-obsessed mechanic Carter Chambers. Ironically, Edward is the one who insists upon two patients to each room to cut overhead costs. Both are terminal cases there to receive cancer treatments with little if any chance of survival. Unsurprisingly, they enact their own version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odd-Couple/dp/B0000507P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odd Couple</a>&nbsp;until they bond over a list Carter is compiling of little things he wants to do before he does. Edward naturally has more grandiose ideas of what his ""bucket list"" would be, and off they go on a series of predictably drawn adventures like skydiving, race-car driving and traveling to exotic places around the world. I find the travel sequences particularly amusing since it's obvious the actors were edited into travelogue footage. Deep-seeded regrets come to the surface on their journey - Edward's estrangement from his daughter and Carter's look back on an academic life unfulfilled and a marriage that has grown stale. There's no point in describing anything further since the whole point of the film is dealing with the inevitable.

As Edward, Nicholson comes across as oddly schizophrenic. The actor's typically excessive moments are followed by surprisingly understated ones, and as a whole, his performance never connects the dots. Freeman fares marginally better as Carter, but his work here feels more like retread. Again, he provides the stoic voiceover and wizened wisdom he has been providing since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B0002J4ZWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>.

He is so uncharacteristically restrained and non-committal in the role that the coda has little emotional impact. Relegated even further to the sidelines are Beverly Todd as Carter's wife, Rob Morrow as Edward's doctor, and in a silly bit part, Rowena King as a chic woman drawn to Carter in a bar. I'm not surprised that the 2008 DVD is bereft of significant extras - no commentary track, no making-of featurette,  just a five-minute short, ""Writing a Bucket List"" with Zackham explaining the genesis of the movie's concept, plus a disposable John Mayer video for the closing credits song, ""Say"", which is, by the way, a typical John Meyer song. I suggest renting ""Ikiru"" instead.",1213833600,10,4601,6.902061855670103
3025517,5,B000YAF4MA,"Whether you've written a list of the things you want to do with your life or just let them run through your mind, this becomes the ""bucket list""...the list of things you want to do before kicking the bucket.  The two main characters in this movie faced with the reality of death on the near horizon decide to live in the moment and find joy in the daily events of life.

The movie begins with a cut throat businessman (Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole) and a true gentleman (Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers) trapped in the same hospital room.  Not immediate friends -- in fact they couldn't be more different but that allows each of them to grow and challenge each other.

Their journey begins with their escape from the hospital where they begin their travels over the world...completing their list of things to do along the way.  The list itself involves both general accomplishments and gestures of kindness. Crossing off each item is a milestone full of smiles for both.

While most of the movie is carried by the main characters...their interaction with others truly conveys their personalities.  Like place Edward in the boardroom ...full of power and control...stating his ""no exceptions...two to a hospital room policy"" which of course he wants the exception when he finally gets sick but is stuck sharing a room.  Then you have Carter who finds so much of his personal joy and accomplishment with his family...supporting and loving time with them. Life has tests just like in the movie...people make choices...and it isn't about pass or fail...but rather what is right for you.

As a whole, I think this movie is one of genuine heart...family...the moments in life that take your breath away.  If you're looking for action...it has its funny skydiving moment among others but isn't that kind of movie.  There is humor that made me laugh so hard that I cried and yet given the subject matter...moments of loss like death are sad. It is a mixture...just like many of the metaphors used throughout.  In the end of your life...measure yourself by those that measure themselves by you...but live for the joy in the moment...as one doesn't need to get a death sentence to know that death could be sooner than we'd like to face.",1213747200,,2229,4.776041666666667
3025518,4,B000YAF4MA,"(3.5 *`s)  You've probably seen the previews, so much elaboration isn't needed, but `Bucket List' is still a worthy journey even if the plot is laid out for you already.  Sweet, sage, and funny, Rob Reiner delivers another heartwarming gem that's rejuvenating to watch.

They couldn't be more opposite.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy owner of hospitals where the frills are fleeting at best.  ""We run hospitals, not health spas,"" Edward brashly tells his potential clients.  ""Two guests to a room, no exceptions.""  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is mild and wise.  He is a mechanic at a garage supporting his family, but is an academic at heart and a trivia expert who would make Cliff Claven blush.  A fellow colleague is always trying to stump him with questions from a trivia book, and Carter's favorite past time is to blurt out the answers (questions really) while watching 'Jeopardy'.

You guessed it.  They both have cancer and have to share a room in one of his hospitals.  Thomas* (whose real name is Matthew, but is too hard for Edward to keep track of) is his assistant.  He can't have his own room because it would be bad PR not to follow his own rules.  Edward does get top service by his doctor (Rob Morrow who plays a far different MD than he did on `Northern Exposure'.)  The odd couple take a while to warm up to each other.  Each is absorbed in his own interests, and each has foibles that would annoy anyone.

As their prospects both turn terminal, Edward comes across Carter's ""bucket list"".  Meant to be a whimsical exercise from Carter's philosophy professor, it gets them thinking about using their precious last moments to do what they haven't done before.  Edward has the money but Carter has the wisdom, so sorting out their priorities turns from a final blessing to a final battle.  Carter, who always wanted to be a history professor, decides to take up Edward's offer to take a whirlwind tour of the world and discover the joys of skydiving and race car driving to name just two.  (""You gonna drive it or give it a dress?"" asks an impatient Edward to Carter the mechanic who would truly appreciate the opportunity.)

This is all to the chagrin of Virginia, (also Ginny)[Beverly Todd], Carter's devoted nurse wife.  (""You're a fool who's figured out a way not have cancer,"" she chides her husband.  And to Edward:  ""My husband is not for sale."")  Carter rekindles Edward's ability to think deeply.  He offers Edward the challenge that below the surface relationships and getting one's house in order really matter.  It's not just about the fun.

Once they're on the road, they have several disagreements.  One of the best merits of the movie is how it can transition from fun and funny to philosophical.  Some may find the whole affair ponderous, but I loved the way both grapple emotionally, physically, and intellectually to the challenges that death provides.  If you liked books and movies like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tuesdays-with-Morrie/dp/B00008L3SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tuesdays with Morrie</a>,' then surely 'Bucket List' should appeal to you.

We've all seen ""The Little Old Lady from Pasadena"" routine so often:  Gramps or granny is in a hot rod, saying displaced things like ""cool"" and ""far out.""  It usually is funny and offensive at the same time.  This factor couldn't be more remote from the film.  There's never a bitter aftertaste when watching the elderly men doing young things.  It's all done thoughtfully and tastefully.  The dialogue is excellent.  The jokes are funny; the questions posed are interesting, but without the dead ends, for they provide some thoughtful answers as well.

Watching this film reminds me that watching a three-and-a-half-star film can sometimes be more rewarding than watching a full five-star film.  In the end, 'The Bucket List' is a feel good movie with some substance that should be put on your movie ""list"".

3025519,5,B000YAF4MA,"When the film started I was expecting a film that is uplifting and heartwarming instead I found it really unrealistic. The scene where they are in the hospital is depressing and very real.  Everything else is third rate and filled with situations that are ridiculous.  Even when they were traveling the locations where boring and you felt as if they weren't even there.  I have the respect for both of these A-list actors especially Jack Nicholson. He is an institution.  And Morgan Freeman is top notch in this performance.  However, they had chemistry but you couldn't really figured out how a business tycoon could have a hear.  It was entertaining but not really moving because we all have bucket list but throughout the course of a lifetime we don't write off everything in our lists.  We all don't have a friend with millions to help.  So it wasn't realistic instead it was materialistic.  It tried so hard to be a moving film but it fell flat and felt forced.  This is a very good film that is fun to watch and has a pairing that is really strange but a wise decision.  Please don't find my comments to cruel or vain.  I appreciate the sentiment and the message does sink in but I would rather spend my days with my loved ones than with some friend.

I must admit I was curious to see what was on the 'bucket list' of the characters and I was prepared to find myself in for a rollicking good time. What I didn't expect was to be taken completely by surprise at the depth of emotions I felt as I watched Freeman and Nicholson portray the two main characters.

By now you know that both men are faced with short life expectancies and they set out to do the things they've always wanted to do. What drew me to these two was the fact that they came from such opposite backgrounds. Sure we have the rich white guy and the average-income black guy but as the story unfolds we see who truly is the richest person. For my money, it is Freeman's character since his riches are counted in people and love rather than cold hard cash.

As the two travel the world in their quest to complete their bucket list, the bond that is formed is real yet fragile. There were times when I could do nothing but cry but also times when I was reminded that sometimes in the face of desperation it is better to laugh. Nicholson is superb acting as the know-it-all millionaire who can't seem to untangle his hospital cords without help!

Kudos should be given to Sean Hayes for his portrayal of the assistant to Nicholson's rich-guy character. It takes a confident actor to hold his own on screen with both Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.

3025524,4,B000YAF4MA,"Both Freeman and Nicholson have made their share of poignant (read: soppy) coming-to-terms movies in the past ten years. The Bucket List is not one of them.

It could be seen as a buddy flick in which two near-strangers conspire to race death to the finish line by cramming a lifetime's worth of unfulfilled dreams into an ever-closing window of opportunity. The Bucket List is more than that.

This is Nicholson's movie, though fact is artfully subtle until the very end. Reiner's invisible hand lets the script and characters take their respective paths without cliche, or excessive use of violins in the backing track.

Though the cover art might lead one to think otherwise, this is not a happy/funny movie in the traditional Hollywood sense and, thus, it is (thankfully) neither blockbuster nor Oscar-bound.

3025525,4,B000YAF4MA,"I expected this film to be a comedy. There were a few funny scenes, but the overall seriousness of the main character's medical prognosis dominates the tone of the movie.

Nicholson does very well with his role, but it's the same type of character we've seen him play many times before. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. Both are excellent actors, but they really aren't treading new territory with this outing.

Also, the story is rather predictable and the characters seem to be cardboard cutouts.

So why 4 stars?

This movie has a lot of heart and delivers a beautiful message. It causes the watcher (or it SHOULD cause) to reflect inward and take a good look at himself (or herself). What am I doing with my life? How is my life affecting others? How do I want to be remembered?

Sappy? Yes. Sentimental? Yes.

But life can often be those things. How we deal with death is just as important as how we deal with life (I think Captain Kirk once said words to that effect, but I digress).

Jack Nocholson and Morgan Freeman demonstrate their typical outstanding acting abilities, portraying their very different character personalities, but making them quite believeable.  Their acting makes this story come to life, getting watchers very involved with their lives dealing with terminal cancer.  Their ""Bucket List"" travels are very interesting, and you see very picturesque locations, including the Taj Mahal and The Great Wall of China.  I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved to tears at times.  To demonstrate the deepness of thought from this movie, here's what Morgan Freeman said that Phaeroes in Egypt had to answer before they could be admitted into the afterlife: 1. Have you found joy in your life?, and 2. Have you brought joy into the lives of others?  Answer those questions for yourself, then be sure to watch this powerful movie.

3025527,4,B000YAF4MA,"Selecting a category for this very fine film results in the all-encompassing label 'mixed media', for lack of a better term.  It is smart (with an excellent script by Justin Zackham), addresses some important social issues, and it has moments of touching tenderness and equal moments of very sold comedy. AND it greatly benefits from the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, two consummate actors playing out a theme that is unexpectedly a solid study of friendship and love.

Carter (Morgan Freeman) narrates the story: Carter gave up his dreams for a college education and major career to support his surprise child from his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has worked as a mechanic to support his own family, including his son Roger (Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son in real life also!). After his children have all become successful, Carter is suddenly  diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is hospitalized for chemotherapy, only to be placed in the same room with the wealthy and cantankerous owner of the hospital, Edward (Jack Nicholson) who also has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is also in the hospital for chemotherapy.  Edward's only 'friend' (he has basically alienated the world through his behavior) is his assistant Thomas (an excellent Sean Hayes) who tends to his every need.  Gradually the two disparate men grow into a friendship united by the common bond that they both must face impending death. Together they create 'the bucket list' - things they want to do before dying, and because of Edward's wealth, they leave the hospital on a worldwide adventure of skydiving, racing cars, visiting the pyramids, etc. The manner in which these two elderly men bond casts a warm glow over the film without ever touching on the maudlin risk of communication. They simply grow in their appreciation of life as they learn from each other.

Freeman and Nicholson are in peak form here and the supporting cast is very fine.  But special credit must go to director Rob Reiner for giving us yet another film about humanism that would enrich the lives of anyone who takes the time to watch this very fine film.

A Universal DVD

This is a story that coveys the close relationship that develops between two utterly different men that must share the same hospital room after being both diagnosed with advanced terminal cancer. The first, Edward Cole- Jack Nicholson- is the CEO that runs the hospital and is a ruthless persona and the second is a mechanic, Carter- Morgan Freeman-, who wanted in his youth to be a history teacher but life circumstances did not allow him to do so. They share the common adversities of the infirmity and they, ant the same time, share a long trip that will tie the relationship even further.

One day, Carter starts to write a ""Bucket List"" containing all the things that he would like to do before he dies and Cole finds it out. Afterward, they decide to write the ""Bucket List"" together and start going on marvelous trips around the world and sharing precious moments and becoming the best of friends.  Two utterly different persons become the closest friends ever in the last months of their lives.

What really stroke me about this DVD was that it not only applies to two terminal cancer patients: What stroke me the most is its universality. If we think a little deeper, it could apply to two or more persons sharing similar adversities- or joyfulness for that matter- and relying on each other for comfort, understanding, and the sharing of knowledge and experiences.

The performances of the two principal actors are outstanding and make you laugh and cry at different times during the performance.

3025535,4,B000YAF4MA,"I see another reviewer here at Amazon.com is recommending purchase of this flick (see review titled: Don't Hold Back).  I'm not trying to be contrary, but I'll disagree a bit with that recommendation.  Not because the movie isn't worth it, but more because the Blu-ray disc version is relatively sparce on extras and also because the long-term value for this disc/package doesn't seem high enough to get over the threshold I'd would normally set for recommending purchase versus rental.

The film itself is certainly worth viewing, so at least do yourself the favor of renting via Unbox or any other service you prefer.  While the subject matter is sad and somewhat depressing (two victims of cancer or other terminal diseases bond while sharing a hospital room) to begin with, the journey the two individuals make is heartwarming and somewhat uplifting.

The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 97 minutes.  The first major portion of the film deals with the main characters finding out about their illnesses and living through (mostly suffering through) treatment for same.  That segment is fairly depressing and not necessarily easy to get through.  It is worth watching just to educate yourself on what life with cancer or a tumor is like, and especially what life while being treated for such things would be like.

Once past that part of the film, the story that was promised in trailers and advertisements for the movie comes through, that of a pair of friends that go off to do the things on their 'bucket list' -- a list of things to be done before kicking the bucket.

Seeing these two great actors playing these roles and doing a great job in portraying their characters is well worth the price of admission here.  They both are living legends, and both do a great job of playing believable characters.  Additionally, the director for the film is none other than Rob Reiner, himself a legandary director.  A genuine A team of talent.

See this movie.  It is most definitely recommended viewing.  Purchase decision really comes down to what you want from a Blu-ray disc or DVD package.  Basic movie? It's here.  A few extras? Yeah, there are a few here, and those that are here aren't bad, but overall the bundle is weak and leaves the feeling that there should have been more.",1213228800,,2289,4.795918367346939

To know that these chaps will most likely die by the end makes it all the more important to see how they decide to enjoy their last months on Earth and accomplish all the things they never got around to or never had the courage to in their lives.  There is no more time to procrastinate, as it's now or never for both Carter (Freeman) and Edward (Nicholson).  The fine performances of the supporting cast, namely Sean Hayes as Edward's personal assistant and Carter's wife, make the viewer see the illness from all sides, not just from the eyes of the patient, but also from the family who wants to nurture and protect till the very end, but needs to learn to let go in these final months in order for the men to fulfil their life long dreams.  The concept of a Bucket List is easily applied to anyone, and hopefully you will not be faced with the grave diagnoses that these characters must deal with; don't put off till tomorrow what you can reach for today, and while you have the time on this Earth, grab your life and LIVE IT, don't die with regrets and unreached dreams, for this will only make for a lonely end.  A tearjerker with a great John Mayer song, SAY, which captures the essence of the entire film's message.  Extras include a brief interview with the writer about how the idea of The Bucket List came about plus Language selection for viewing the film in English, French or Spanish.

Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman excel as they capture us in the emotions of their moments.  These two men are still in their prime as actors.  As I watched the movie with a friend, we forgot who we were and became part of the story. The music is mesmerizing. The scenery is breath-taking. Don't miss this movie.

Morgan Freeman plays the part of a mechanic, Carter Chambers, who wanted to be a history teacher. Because he was broke and black and his wife was pregnant, he did not get a formal education.  Instead, he studied history at home.  Jack Nicholson, the billionaire who owns the hospital, is a cynic, who has never learned to live.  He has been divorced four times, and his daughter is not on speaking terms with him.

The two are roommates undergoing cancer treatment.  The plot is centered around a list of things they set out to do before kicking the bucket.

Here's the list:
1. Witness something truly majestic
2. Help a complete stranger for a common good
3. Laugh till I cry
4. Drive a Shelby mustang
5. Kiss the most beautiful girl in the world
6. Get a tattoo
7. Skydiving
8. See the pyramids
9. Get back in touch with ...(a daughter)
10.???

3025545,2,B000YAF4MA,"This is a painfully sentimental movie about love and death. You would be a hard soul indeed if you could sit through this without choking just a little. What makes it worth watching is that it calls the question of the bucket list: just what would you do if you knew your time was limited?

If you're willing to stay with it, it also calls for two more reflections:

*What sort of things are on your list? Is it mostly a check-off of things that other people agree are important or are they things that really, deeply matter to you?

*Your time is limited whether you know it or not, so what's stopping you from doing what's on your list?

The movie itself requires that you drift off a little: the outside shots are so artificial that you feel like you're watching a car commercial or the weather report on TV.
The acting consists mostly of Nicholson and Freeman being themselves-or at least the screen versions. On two occasions, they try to expand their range and the results are disastrous. Freeman tries to express fear when he's about to jump from an airplane. Nicholson goes for deep emotion when he delivers a eulogy at Freeman's funeral.
There are two cameos worth mentioning: Beverly Todd as Freeman's wife is so beautiful that you can barely notice the fine job she does. Rowena King as the young woman sent to tempt Freeman has that rare combination of screen-shattering beauty and intelligent portrayal that should lead to brilliant career.",1212796800,6,1453,4.6640625

I almost don't know anyone who's not affected by cancer in some form or another and the reality of making a list of what you'd like to do before you die is depressing, yet somehow moving and touching.  I really like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman and ultimately, I think that's what sold me about seeing this and now I'm glad that I did.
The chemistry between Morgan and Jack was amazing.  This is definately one of the most fun and uplifting movies I'd seen in a while and yes I cried in it, but also there were moments of laughter too.  Edward Cole (Nicholson) is wealthy and through his money, he and Carter Chambers (Freeman) do things like touring the world, race car driving and skydiving.
Other than the cheesy dialogue and some predictability, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's a feel good movie with a lesson that you shouldn't need to have a death sentance over you to start living.  Also being faced with death doesn't mean you can't live out the rest of your time rather than fall into depression and accept your fate.  I cannot say enough about how good this film is and I hope you will to.  It's definately worth watching for sure.",1212451200,5,1210,4.4434389140271495

3025548,3,B000YAF4MA,"After reading other reviews, I went to the theater.  Jack Nicholson was his usual self, sometimes streaching the boundaries of credulity -  especially with a manic-depressive persona.  Morgan Freeman is a very good actor and turns in a respectable, if predictable performance.  One star was taken away for using stock footage of famous places.  eg The scene in Africa with wildabeast crossing a river is a favorite of tourists with cameras.  The one in Egypt was also hard on the eyes.  The other star deduction was for the inability of the director/editor to make the story flow.
While I actually enjoyed the story line, the movie never made it to where I was able to suspend my disbelief and become involved with the characters.  It could have been a great film, if all the people working on it had spent a little more time making the movie instead of rushing it into the theaters.
Unfortunately, because of the flaws, the DVD is not one I would buy and keep.",1209081600,5,961,4.644970414201183
3025549,5,B000YAF4MA,"The Bucket List tells the sensitive and well thought-out story of two older men who are diagnosed with cancer so severe that they have six months to live--or maybe a year if they're lucky. Look for stunning performances from both Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers and Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole. Beverly Todd also acts her heart out as Beverly Chambers, Carter's wife.

The action begins when Carter Chambers, a working class black man, and Edward Cole, super-wealthy self-made rich white guy who actually owns the hospital they're in become roommates in the oncology ward of the hospital. At first Carter and Edward don't exactly hit it off but it isn't long before they forge a friendship. When they each learn that by coincidence they have six months to a year to live, they embark on a trip to accomplish certain lifelong dreams and personal goals before they die. The list of things to do is called The Bucket List because it's a list of things to do before they ""kick the bucket.""

Of course, because Edward Cole is wealthy many scenes in this movie become almost miraculously possible. They travel the world by private corporate jet; and they live more in just a few weeks than most people ever do in a lifetime.

Of course, life has its ways of surprising just about any of us; so still the plot could go just about anywhere. How will Beverly, Carter's wife, react to all this? Will she understand and remain patient while Carter lives out a few lifelong dreams or will she want her husband home NOW? Will Carter and Edward be able to keep their cool when they are stranded in Asia during a monstrous snowstorm and they are not allowed to fly? What happens if one of them gets very sick along the way? What about Edward's refusal to make up with his daughter who disowned him long ago--will he ever decide to approach her or will he remain obstinate in his refusal to even meet with her? The results may surprise you. No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

As a cancer survivor who is finishing my own chemotherapy soon, I will add that some of the side-effects of the chemotherapy they receive are exaggerated. However, I think director Rob Reiner added these elements to the film to make it somewhat more dramatic.

Overall, The Bucket List is an excellent movie; and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman turn in superlative performances that proves these guys can still act better than the vast majority of actors ever could. Beverly Todd does a great job as Carter's wife; and Sean Hayes also does well as Edward Cole's personal assistant Thomas. I highly recommend this film for fans of these terrific actors; and people comfortable with the subject matter will appreciate this motion picture as well.",1208908800,53,2788,4.693251533742331
3025550,4,B000YAF4MA,"Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a relatively happy man. Carter is a self-taught man with a thirst for knowledge that is never quite quenched. He has three children, a devoted wife, and is an ace mechanic. A telephone call one morning from the hospital changes everything. The operation he had months before was unsuccessful and has terminal cancer in the brain. Carter finds himself in the hospital participating in a ""promising"" experimental treatment. Carter's roommate in the hospital turns out to be none other than the CEO of the hospital, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson). Edward has built a fortune and an empire by turning failing hospitals around into relatively profitable businesses. However, as Edward soon learns profitable hospitals aren't necessarily customer friendly or the nicest places to stay. Edward has a similar illness as Carter and the men from two different worlds soon develop a friendship. One day, while waiting for his test results Carter begins writing a ""bucket list"" a list of all the things he would like to do before he ""kicks the bucket"". When he receives news that he only has about six months to live at the most, Carter abandons the idea. Edward, however, won't allow Carter to give up so easily and together the two men take off on a journey around the world living out their every whim, from skydiving, to eating lunch on one of the Great Pyramids, to racing expensive sports cars. Along the way the two men learn a great deal about friendship and themselves.

THE BUCKET LIST is a fairly engaging, sentimental movie. The movie has a strong emotional appeal, especially if anyone has lost a parent or parental figure in their lives. Freeman and Nicholson make a great team and I wish they would have done more movies together in their careers. On the negative side, the opening and concluding segments of THE BUCKET LIST are a bit confusing. Also, I was a bit disappointed that the film didn't have more of Carter and Edward participating in more adventures. Despite the confusing moments and a lack of adventures, THE BUCKET LIST is still a pretty decent film with a lot of heart and an important message about living life to the fullest.",1208736000,,2180,4.8445040214477215

There was a serious undertone to it, especially with Morgan's character, and later on Jack's. Some of it was kind of formulaic, but I did expect that. What made the movie was the subtle moments between the two leads. The nuances of their banter, the crazy humor in the most awful times of the characters experiences, the total hilarity infused in these scenes had me busting a gut. So damn funny. Good messages too. I like Morgan in everything I've ever seen him in, he's one of the best. But Jack really stole the show. He totally nailed this role. I think this is the funniest, most honest performance I've seen, not only from him, but in a long time. I can't stress enough - see this movie just for Jack and consider everything else a bonus. Having acknowledged the formulaic parts, things that could have been deeper, more fleshed out, I really dug the ending. That's where the movie, in my opinion, shed the formula.

Obviously Nicholson and Freeman have great chemistry but it's not like this movie is a lot more exciting than showing them playing cards or something. I love Freeman's narrations but: a) I don't think the Nicholson character earns his and b) enough is enough of them.

3025556,5,B000YAF4MA,"Saw this one in the theater.  This was an excellent film with acting greats Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as 2 older gentlemen, both diagnosed with terminal cancer.  They meet when they become hospital roommates through operations and chemotherapy treatments (and heads in the toilet bowl).  They are an unlikely pair of opposites who find consolation within the tender caring sides of each other.

Jack is a billionaire, previously married 4 times, currently single, and estranged from his one child, a daughter.  Morgan is a family man, married with children and grandchildren.  Jack is a little outspoken and wild.  Morgan is like a quiet southern gentleman.  They become great friends in the hospital and decide to make a ""Bucket List"" (a list of things to do before they kick the bucket).  So, with Jack's money and Jack's personal assistant to make all arrangements, and Jack's private plane, they take off to do all the things on the list.

Although in content it is certainly sad, it is also uplifting that they get to live the rest of their time doing some very special things as well as bonding in a beautiful loving friendship.  There are lots of laughs, too.  This movie will have you both laughing and crying as you go through the final months of the lives of these two men.

On a side note, I can understand if you are leery of seeing a movie about 2 men dying of cancer.  I was a little uneasy about the subject matter myself, since I lost my 53 year old mother, 64 year old father, and 40-year old brother to cancer.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was glad I watched it.  And, of course, the acting job was superb.  I even took my 15-year old granddaughter to see the movie.  I asked her what rating she would give it, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being outstanding.  She gave it a 9 --and I certainly agree!

Note: This ""Bucket List"" thing is a great idea, not that I'm expecting to cross over anytime soon.  I kept a mental Bucket List for awhile and some things that were on it I wound up doing, so even though it might seem too expensive, or unlikely for whatever reason, it's a good idea to make the list. A couple of places that I wanted to see, but didn't think I could afford, were: San Diego, Denver, the Mayan ruins in Mexico, the Canadian Rockies, and Alaska.  Somehow, the trips manifested just by thinking about them and somehow they were affordable.  I even went to the Canadian Rockies TWICE (2004 and 2007) because the deal was so good.

So, some more things on my bucket list are: Aspen/Mt. Estes/Vail, Colorado (no, I don't ski), a Barry Manilow concert in London, Machu Piccu Peru, Mt. Shasta California, Sedona Arizona, Stonehedge, Avalon, Ireland, a Panama Canal cruise, Lourdes France, Australia, and New Zealand.  I probably left something out, but there it is.

If one can find balance in one's life and utilize every day wisely, I guess one will be a content person always. If one can live by the US Army's theme ""Be All that You Can Be"" every single day, I think one would have lived life well.

3025559,3,B000YAF4MA,"""There was a survey once, a thousand people asked, `If they could know in advance, would they want to know the exact day of their death?'--96% said no."" This is the core base of this film as the two main characters find themselves pushed into the other 4%.

These two characters are billionaire tycoon Edward Cole (played by Jack Nicholson) and car mechanic Carter Chambers (played by Morgan Freeman) that are both terminally ill with cancer, have both been given less than a year to live, and find themselves sharing the same hospital room. During the weeks they spend at the cancer ward, Carter makes a ""bucket list"" for fun, but Edward takes it more seriously and wants to start checking things off. So, after a fight with his wife Carter and Edward embark on a luxurious tour of all the finest locations in the world--the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Himalayas, the Mediterranean, a Safari, etc.--as well as crazy stunts like: sky diving, racing sports cars, and even getting a tattoo.

This is one of those warm, cozy films that you can use for pure entertainment, and it works well. The script is horrible but you do not notice it as much since the performances from the two leads more than make up for it. There are plenty of ""how could..."" (especially the fact that a billionaire would share a common hospital room in the first place) but to enjoy this film you have to take everything as it is presented.

The once thing that did upset me was the portrayal of Carter's wife as the nagging wife who only naturally would be devastated finding out your husband is leaving on a world tour just after hearing the news that he will only be around for about a year longer.

Still, this is one of those films that despite the poor production quality (it is really poor when the pyramids look like fake back-drops in our CGI-obsessed world) the performances by two of Hollywood's most veteran actors (both Oscar winners) make The Bucket List something you might want to add to your list of movies seen.",1202256000,,2002,4.599439775910364

3025561,4,B000YAF4MA,"Rob Reiner directs ""The Bucket List,"" a little film with a big message that boasts two mega stars who only epitomize in these roles that for which they have become noted and respected in countless others.

Jack Nicholson plays Edward Cole, the quintessentially cynical billionaire with the same world-weary ennui and uncertainty that he brought to the character of Warren Schmidt in the 2002 film ""About Schmidt.""  For years he wheels and deals as one of the big movers and shakers in the health care industry.  As his collapsible morality and an inflexible adherence to his people-unfriendly hospital policies transmutes handsomely into a larger bank account but yields scant personal relationships, Cole thinks himself far too savvy to believe in a higher being yet preens with self-satisfaction regarding his sophisticated tastes and appreciation of the best of the material things the world has to offer.  Vintage Nicholson.

Enter the perfect foil, the wonderfully elegant Morgan Freeman.  He  imbues the character of Carter Chambers, a wisdom-seeking egghead auto mechanic who sacrificed an education and a more promising future for the sake of his growing family with his ever-present serenity in the face of any adversity and nobility that any knight of Arthur's legendary Round Table would be proud to possess.  Think the stoically patient and hopeful Red in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tempered to a rich patina where a look conveys a multitude of emotions and elicits immediate audience response.

When cancer strikes both Cole and Chambers, both men's very different lifestyles hover in a holding pattern that targets death within six months.  Unlikely companions, they compose a list of ""things to do before kicking the bucket"" and embark on a journey stocked with once-in-a-lifetime experiences and friendship-forging moments where each man's perspective is explored through their lives' mistakes and triumphs.  Of course, lessons are learned and thankfully, the audience is allowed a happy, albeit tearful, ending of sorts where this meeting of two opposites produces a pleasant mellow glow that is meant to initiate reflection and illuminate one's own legacy.

Bottom line?  ""The Bucket List"" may be a comedy that laughs in the face of death, but more so, it evokes a bittersweet reaction that begs the audience to look within and define the importance of life.  Some may argue that some of the film's adventure sequences seem a bit overly sentimental and overstocked with big questions that cannot be answered during a two-hour time frame. Maybe the lessons seem to be learned too fast.  In the same respect, it could be said that Nicholson and Freeman may just be portraying themselves without the need for character definition, but honestly, I don't think any of this really matters.  The film captures the essence of Reiner's purpose; the audience definitely empathizes with both of these esteemed actors.  Not for a moment was I bored by their performances.  Rather, I was amazed at how effortless both of these American institutions make their craft seem.  Happily, ""The Bucket List"" fully delivers what it intends:  a satisfying film fraught with life and death, friendship and family, laughter and tears.  Recommended with the caveat that for those who have lost someone to cancer, the hospital sequences will serve as a sad reminder of this experience.

3025563,5,B000YAF4MA,"Morgan Freeman plays a brainiac, a highly intellectual, intelligent man who, as he says, ""spent 45 years greased up under the hood of a car"" so that his children would have the kind of life he'd always dreamt about for himself.

As was true for many men of his generation, he wanted to be sure that his children ""would never want for anything and they didn't."" He sacrificed and worked and toiled for a lifetime, always putting his family's needs ahead of his own long-cherished dream to get a college degree and become a history professor. And his lifetime of self-sacrifice bore much fruit: His three children went to college and became successful professionals.

Nicholson and Freeman forged a bond, and became friends despite the fact that the two men were complete opposites and would never have crossed paths in day-to-day life, were it not for their illness.

Nicholson lived an life that was the diametrical opposite of Freeman's character; a life which was characterized by debauchery, lasciviousness and general over-indulgence, always keeping a keen eye open, looking out for Number One. His legacy is a business, which has made him a multi-millionaire.

In the few weeks the men have left, Freeman gives Nicholoson a few life lessons about real success and love and the joy that can be found in self-sacrifice and Freeman shows Nicholson that the love we leave behind and the life example we leave behind can be our most enduring and important life legacy.

And Nicholson gives Freeman an extraordinary gift. Nicholson shows Freeman the world that he's spent decades reading about in books.

My favorite line in the movie: According to Egyptian lore, you're asked two questions at the gates of heaven: First, Did you experience joy in your lifetime? And two, did you bring joy to someone else in your lifetime?

Those two questions can leave a soul with a lot to think about.

The Bucket List is one those unusual movies that leaves you with an intellectual and spiritual aftertaste, where you go away pondering the many layers of messages contained in the rich, thoughtful dialogue. The metaphysical riches to the side, it's also a funny movie and Nicholson is in fine form.

I would highly recommend The Bucket List. Well worth your time and money.",1201737600,15,2262,4.885117493472585
3025564,3,B000YAF4MA,"Edward Cole (Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Freeman) have terminal cancer.  They are opposites, with Edward being a rich CEO and Carter being a car mechanic.  They are sharing a room at the hospital, and share the same diagnosis: six months to a year.  Carter begins making a ""bucket list"" - things to do before he dies.  Edward gets in on the list, and having the money funds their attempt to cross everything off that list.  They see the Pyramids of Egypt, the Taj Mahal, and the Great Wall of China.  The skydive and drive race cars.  They share their stories and become good friends.  Soon they realize returning home will help them more than traveling the world.

Nicholson and Freeman are always good, and ""The Bucket List"" is no exception.  They give their usual standout performances.  On the downside, this is a movie that sets out to make views shed a few tears.  This gives the film a feeling of trying to be more important than it really is.  If that could somehow be toned down, this would be a better movie.  There are some good laughs though, and that is the films saving grace.  As it is, it is a harmless diversion for just over two hours.  I would probably recommend this one for DVD viewing.",1201737600,32,1211,4.511520737327189
3025565,5,B000YAF4MA,"By what they've accomplished?  According to soft-spoken cancer patient, Carter (Freeman), you measure a man's life by who measures their lives by yours.

Edward Cole probably was a lot of people's yardstick.  He was wealthy, powerful, and he ran hospitals.

""We run hospitals--not resorts!"" E. Cole (Nicholson)

If Cole hadn't been so mercenary, he'd never have been stuck with another patient in his hospital room.  At first, the very wealthy Cole doesn't care for the soft-spoken auto mechanic, but as time goes on the two develop a friendship--and Cole begins to both share food and care for Carter.

When Edward sees Carter's 'Bucket List,'(a list of items he wants to accomplish before he kicks the bucket) he realizes it's something the two of them can do--and says they should.  That's when the two cancer patients break out of the hospital and go on a world tour. Together, they write out a new bucket list and work to make each other's dreams come true.

""Bucket List"" is sentimental, predictable, and yet more than my words can encompass.  The film's not just about dying, but friendship, and finding joy to spread to others--even at the worst times in a person's life.

In my opinion, the three best aspects of this film were Morgan Freeman's outstanding narration and Sean Hayes' well-done portrayal of Cole's ever-present assistant (Thomas). Another nod goes to actress Beverly Todd, who played Virginia Chambers.  Even the young girls in the film were exclaiming how amazing she looked and acted.

3025566,4,B000YAF4MA,"I have seen many low reviews for the Bucket List, however it doesn't deserve them. It has it's sad and even depressing moments but it's still uplifting and touching. How many movies do we get about living life to the fullest ? The answer is simply, not enough. Sure we all aren't rich like Nicholson's character so we all can't see the world before we die. But the movies heart is in the right place and it's well acted with gorgeous locations.

  I think the problem is that critics have just gotten too used to handing Rob Reiner movies one star and this one didn't deserve it at all. Nicholson and Freeman both have charm and the movie has some too. Maybe there's something wrong with me, I didn't see the Davinci Code as being that bad either lol. But I liked this movie and am ready to stick up for it if I have to.",1200700800,,820,4.243589743589744
3025567,4,B000YAF4MA,"Rob Reiner's ""The Bucket List"" functions with a strong sense of What If: What if you discovered you were terminally ill? What if you finally decided to live your remaining days to the fullest? What if you discovered more in those remaining days than you ever discovered before? Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are faced with scores of What Ifs when both are diagnosed with cancer and given a finite number of days to live--with Cole's help, Chambers uses that precious time to see the world and experience things he had previously only dreamed of. This is obviously not a new idea for a story like this, and the reality is that most of the film is unrealistic and clich. But it's also touching and meaningful, so I have to give credit where credit is due. Simply put, ""The Bucket List"" is an unabashed tearjerker, a film that's simultaneously witty and sentimental for maximum effect.

The film opens with one of Freeman's voiceover narrations, and that in and of itself is a clich: consider ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Feast of Love"" and ""The Hunting of the President"" and ... I think you get the idea. Anyway, his character's narration acts as a framing device, one that will be filled with the events of the main story. The first character to be established is Chambers, who has worked as a mechanic for the past forty-five years. He's knowledgeable about many things, which is why he's able to watch ""Jeopardy!"" and answer virtually every question. We first see him in his auto shop, answering trivia questions with his co-worker; at that point, he receives a devastating phone call from his wife, one that forces him to drop his cigarette and walk away in a daze. Apparently, the test results from his latest medical exam paint a grim picture for his future.

Soon after, Cole is introduced. A multimillionaire, Cole is savvy and inflexible, with a dry and completely off-putting sense of humor. He also has an affinity for Kopi Luwak coffee, the world's most expensive (and most disgusting--if you really must know why, look it up on your own). He owns a hospital in Los Angeles, and he has a strict policy when it comes to patient lodging: Two beds to a room, no exceptions. Private rooms aren't allowed because, as he puts it, ""I run hospitals, not health spas."" Upon his cancer diagnosis, he's taken in for emergency surgery, after which he's wheeled into the same hospital room occupied by Chambers; at that point, Cole pleads to be given his own room, and never mind the bad PR.

Before long, Cole and Chambers form a companionship of sorts. It would be too much to say that they become fast friends--Cole's personality would make that virtually impossible, especially so soon after they meet. But they definitely tolerate each other, which is probably why Cole is willing to indulge Chambers in his last days. You see, Chambers begins writing what his old history professor called a Bucket List, which is a list of things one wants to do before dying (also known as kicking the bucket); Cole gets a hold of it and convinces Chambers to not only follow the list, but also to add a few exciting things, like skydiving and racecar driving and seeing sights all over the world. Cole would tag along, but merely as a financier and a motivator, not as a confidant. Not at first, anyway.

All this comes as a surprise to Chambers' wife, Virginia (Beverly Todd), who feels that Cole is stealing her husband away during his final days. Chambers would like nothing more than for his wife to understand where he's coming from: he devoted years of his life to her and their children, and now that he's dying, he feels he's earned a little time for himself. Much to Virginia's chagrin, Chambers and Cole set off on their journey, and as you've probably guessed, this journey will be profound, revealing many things about both characters. For one thing, we learn that Chambers had once hoped to be a history professor. We also learn that Cole has endured four failed marriages, one of which introduced his daughter into the world. For reasons I won't reveal, the two haven't spoken in years--this is a golden opportunity for Chambers, who tries to use his knowledge and philosophical wisdoms to urge Cole towards reconciling.

If these themes of self-discovery, friendship, and family seem routine, that's because they are. ""The Bucket List"" doesn't really give us anything new, especially when it comes to the obligatory epiphanies; in stories like this, a character's impending death always makes him or her appreciate life, usually for the first time. But I have to be honest--it's still an effective movie, if not for the story, then for reaffirming our emotions. This applies to both ends of the scale: parts of the film are incredibly funny while other parts are incredibly sad. One of the funnier moments occurs when Cole and Chambers visit the Taj Mahal in India: Cole can't decide on his funeral arrangements. An ordinary burial makes him feel claustrophobic. Cremation is risky because the person may not be completely dead when it happens.

The sadder moments are mostly reserved for the end, and while I won't say what happens, I think you have a pretty good idea. ""The Bucket List"" is not a perfect film, but it's still poignant and endearing, and its sense of humor is generally well placed. There's also a decent performance by Sean Hayes as Thomas, Cole's personal assistant (his real name is Matthew, but Cole found that too Biblical). I'm recommending this film mostly for its well-established but important message of living life to the fullest. Why? Let me answer that with another question: What if?",1200182400,34,5734,4.798582995951417
3025568,5,B000YAF4MA,"What an amazing movie.  In my husband's adult life, he has cried perhaps sixth times. The sixth time was while watching the movie THE BUCKET LIST. It is a movie about using every last breath that God gives to you, and to live your life to the fullest.  Too many people die with regrets because they never did the things they dreamt of doing when they became adults.  Both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman give outstanding performances in this buddy-movie/comedy with real dramatic depth. Someone who feels critical about this movie or thinks that it is just a bunch of sentimental malarkey never may have witnessed life from an ICU hospital bed, full of depression and wondering if he or she is going to survive the week.  I have been in this position and even now, almost seven years later, I can still struggle to realize how important it is to make every moment count.

3025570,4,B000YAF4MA,"Director Rob Reiner has made a funny, touching, moving, sad, and poignant film that doesn't try or pretend to be anything than what it is. It sets out on this journey about two men and effectively touches upon all those things I just mentioned, and all those emotions. Mission accomplished. What you see is pretty much what you expect having seen the trailers for the film. It doesn't exactly re-invent the wheel or offer much in the way of surprises, but it doesn't have to. It's about these two men. Their story. And when you have these two particular performers as Edward Cole and Carter Chambers, they raise the film to even greater heights, and make it that much more special and meaningful. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman team up for the first time and, thankfully, the movie is a lot more than just dream casting. They are a brilliant pair, and one wishes they had teamed up a lot sooner than this. As two terminally ill patients, Edward Cole(Nicholson), and Carter Chambers(Freeman), bond while sharing a hospital room. They gradually get better and leave the hospital, but they leave to really experience life and to do things they've always wanted to do before they, you know, kick the bucket. The road trips and adventures the two go on are priceless, but it's the deep characters and nuanced performances here that are front and center. Nicholson is Nicholson, and he proves once again why he is a living legend. You find yourself losing ""Jack"", and seeing ""Edward"". He is amazing. Freeman has always been one of the industry's finest and strongest performers, and here he is his usual wonderful, supportive, and brilliant self. It really is magic seeing the two together. It's never slow or repetitive. The two shine together and make everything better. The only other real co-star here is Will And Grace's Sean Hayes, who is just fine in his role, and offers some laughs of his own. ""The Bucket List"" may be a film where you can tell where it's headed and what will happen, but it doesn't matter at all. It's about the journey getting there, and the journey these two men go on in the last few months they are here on this earth. The commaraderie between them is sparkling, and the dialogue fun and meaningful. It may seem dire, but there is a light that shines thru it all. It definitley doesn't hurt that two of our greatest living actors are leading you thru that light. In the end, the movie may not seem fancy or stick out of the pack, but it's an accomplished film with great perfomers brigning life to great characters.

This common bond creates strange bed fellows as they share a time in their lives that others can't understand.  They take a journey together and both come away changed for the better.
This movie has hilarious moments and sentimental moments that are a part of living and dying in real life.  They are shown in realistic ways not candy coated or through Hollywood eyes.
I really enjoyed this movie and found it entertaining and not troubling as many deep movies are.  This is not a shallow movie it just does not put guilt on the viewer.

3257411,4,B000YAF4MA,"This movie is just about what you expect. Two late-middle-age guys, one indecently rich, the other comfortably un-rich, end up in the same hospital room facing the same no-win battle with cancer. The rich one, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson), owns the hospital, and is offended by having to share a room; he has made a virtue, however, of creating hospitals with unilateral service and few perks beyond good medical care for all - which his assistant points out - and to maintain his stand, he grumpily puts up with his roommate, Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman).

Over the course of time together, they of course become friends (was there any other expectation?); Carter learns to ignore Edward's surly nature, and Edward finds Carter to be that unusual person; someone he can get along with. Both of them realize time is running out, and Edward, with boundless resources, proposes to fulfill an idle dream of Carter's which he happens upon: a ""list of things to do before we kick the bucket"".

With less capable personnel, this movie would have been no more than a Hallmark holiday presentation, but it barely tilts past middle-of-the-road because of the two principals of Nicholson and Freeman, neither of whom can throw a role. Morgan Freeman is famous for sage, compassionate, level-headed characters, and this is no exception. Nicholson is his typical bad-boy self, but is it ever possible to dislike either of them?

Together these veterans launch a full-fledged campaign against their coming debilities by jetting around the world, visiting exotic locales, and doing things they had always wanted to do but either never got around to or, in Carter's case, never had the money for. Edward's long-suffering assistant - another well-acted role by Sean Hayes - capably arranges for all their adventures with a totally blank face, putting up with all manner of rudeness from his employer.

I eagerly anticipated this movie (I'm a big Morgan Freeman fan) and I enjoyed it, but it wasn't quite the knockout I thought it would be. I can honestly say I wasn't disappointed with it; I just thought there would be more - a twist, perhaps. Well-acted, held my interest. Four stars for the casting.",1200009600,2,2190,4.959128065395095

3257414,4,B000YAF4MA,"One of the most fun and uplifting films of the year, Rob Reiner's The Bucket List is also a likely contender for Academy Award nominations. Wonderfully sarcastic dialogue, poignant exchanges between excellently crafted characters, and an overall beautiful tale of mortality and morality, The Bucket List is an excellent opportunity for two of the greatest actors of our time to show off their inimitable techniques. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman have a chemistry that will have you laughing until you cry and crying at the sight of something truly majestic.

Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is an incredibly wealthy hospital owner who firmly believes that he's running infirmaries instead of health spas, and therefore demands that each room contain two beds and two patients. When a twist of fate lands him in his own hospital, he's stuck sharing a room with Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). Both men are dying of cancer, and the doctors give each of them only a few months left to live. The two slowly but surely realize how much they enjoy each other's company, so when Carter begins writing a ""bucket list"", Jack prompts him to see it through. The ""bucket list"" is a list of all the things both Edward and Carter would like to accomplish in their remaining months (before they kick the bucket) and with Cole's wealth, the two end up touring the world, skydiving and racecar driving. As their list of goals begins to come to an end, they realize how much they've truly lived just in the last few months alone, and how much their short friendship has impacted their lives.

Jack Nicholson's performance is excellent as the curmudgeonly Ebenezer character that receives a change of heart and a change of view with Carter's friendship. Little character development is necessary as we have come to recognize Jack's style over the years. We're already familiar with his character and relate to him in much the same way we feel about all of his recent projects. He's attained a level of recognition that allows us to acknowledge him simply as Jack. Regardless of his role, he's still Jack, and he doesn't disappoint.

The same can be said for Morgan Freeman who continues to play roles that accentuate his knack for worldly, wise and good-natured characters that can make us laugh and cry from moment to moment. Rarely do we see two actors work so well together - this odd couple appears to have been destined for these roles. The chemistry between these veterans is pleasantly refreshing, and because of it, The Bucket List is one of the most entertaining films of the year.

Another aspect, which is a great credit to screenwriter Justin Zackham, is the dialogue, which is continually hilarious even while it borders on heartbreaking. Sarcasm and cynicism are proudly worn by Jack, and the conversations conducted between the two are never dull. Meaningful, affecting and downright funny, the script is amazingly well paced and flows more naturally than anything in recent memory.

Nearly everything is likable about The Bucket List, except the tone of the film, which many awards voters and critics may feel is too repetitious of late. The film is uplifting and heartwarming, and while the conclusion strives for unpredictability, comparisons may be drawn to similarly crafted works. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" and ""As Good as it Gets"" are immediately brought to mind, especially because these include the same actors, although the morals of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""It's A Wonderful Life"" are clearly beneath the surface of this feel-good comedy. Despite these comparisons, The Bucket List is wholesome entertainment that will certainly bring director Rob Reiner back into the spotlight, especially after his unpropitious previous project, ""Rumor Has It..."".

It's just a film, one that you enjoy while watching (provided you don't think too hard about it) and then forget soon after seeing.  And while Rob Reiner has made some memorable and great films in his time (""The Princess Bride,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""Misery,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" and even the awful but still memorable ""North""), ""The Bucket List"" is fairly unmemorable, and while it has two strong actors and a fairly enjoyable plot, it's nothing to write home about.

""The Bucket List"" follows two very different men -- an obnoxiously arrogant hospital magnate named Edward (played by Jack Nicholson, who can play roles like this in his sleep) and a down-to-Earth, trivia-obsessed mechanic named Carter (played by Morgan Freeman) -- as they end up sharing a hospital room while undergoing treatment for terminal lung cancer.  Carter, as a means to pass the time between visits from the doctor, starts to fill out a ""bucket list"" of things he would like to accomplish before his death... a list that catches Edward's attention.  Wanting a diversion and seeing Carter as a means to that end, he ends up adding his own items to said list, and soon the two are off on a globe-trotting adventure to cross off everything on said list.  This doesn't go over well with Carter's wife... and when their failing health starts to catch up with them, both Carter and Edward come to realize that there are far more important things they want to do with their final days on Earth...

With a subject matter like this, it's almost impossible to avoid diving headfirst into some corny and schmaltzy scenes.  Reiner has had incredible success in the past balancing darker moments with sweetness, but here, despite the film revolving around death, he gets a little too saccharine for many people.  He did his best to give us a heartwarming film about death, and for the most part he succeeded... but at the cost of mostly avoiding the emotional impact of death and dying, instead focusing on a light-hearted ""buddy"" movie.  And while there's nothing wrong with light-hearted ""buddy"" movies, I do wish the film had spent a little more time exploring the more serious ramifications of its premise.  But that's just me.

Also, while Nicholson is in full form here, it feels like Freeman is given little to do.  Freeman can be a powerful actor given the right material, but this is one of his weaker roles.  And while he does an admirable job with what little he's given, it's still not enough to elevate the movie very far.  And while he's meant to be a foil to Nicholson's egotistical millionaire, he has his own jerkish moments that can kill any sympathy the audience has for him.

Despite my complaints, this movie isn't outright terrible.  It's enjoyable, and quite pretty to look at (there's some gorgeous cinematography from around the world to watch).  It's just not one that's bound to stick with the viewer for very long.  And coming from a director who's given us some truly memorable films over the years, that's a disappointment.",1505088000,,3222,4.7504488330341115

Which, given their diagnosis, might not be so far from the truth. It's got a good heart, but the two legendary leads don't get much script to really sink their teeth into and the trouble they find together often crosses from quaintly naive to downright unrealistic. To me, there was far more of interest in the relationship between Nicholson's grumpy, wannabe-refined old miser and his ironic, long-suffering personal assistant than between Jack and his calm, knowledgeable new travel partner. Still, it has a cute concept, some fun moments, and it moves swiftly, avoiding the typical bog-down of most films of a similar subject matter. As easygoing, feel-good and optimistic a take as you'll ever get from a movie about dying of brain cancer, it's safe, light viewing for the family audience.",1502755200,,989,4.963855421686747

the story

Edward Cole owns many hospitals and he has become very rich possibly at the expense at some of the patients who have stayed in his inpatient rooms. When people complain of crowded rooms and no privacy, his mantra is ""this is a hospital, not a health spa. Two to a room, no exceptions."" Suddenly, Mr. Cole finds himself very ill with brain cancer and he needs to be hospitalized and treated. He finds himself sharing a room with another man with cancer, his name is Carter Chambers. At first, the two don't get along all too well, but when they both learn that they have six months to a year to live, they share a common bond.

While the two were still sharing a room in the hospital, Edward finds a list that Carter was making of things to do before he died, he called it the bucket list. After making additions and a few changes, Edward proposes that the two of them fulfill this list together. So they set out to see the world's greatest sites, to eat the best foods, to face some intense thrills and in the meanwhile comforting each other, becoming friends and more than that, brothers.

There's much more to it, but this is the basic gist of things. You'd have to rent or buy this movie to experience all that it has to offer.

the breakdown

Predictability in a movie tends to be something of a dealbreaker when it comes to enjoying the movie. Bucket List is truly predictable, in fact any movie which employs either Jack Nicholson and/or Morgan Freeman is going to be somewhat predictable. You know Jack Nicholson (The Shining, Batman) is going to play the stubborn-minded white guy who it takes a while to get to know the softer side. Morgan Freeman (Bruce Almighty, The Shawshank Redemption) is always the level headed black guy who maintains the voice of reason and is here to be a kind of life coach. However, Bucket List feels like a breath of fresh air. The constant dialog, the drama, the laughs and of course the emotional connection is so ever present for the viewer to enjoy as Bucket List quickly becomes one of their favorite movies.

The story is one that is easily relatable to all of us, because it deals with our own mortality. Every one of us is going to die, and this film touches upon this subject in a different way than presented before. Conversations between the two characters about what to do with the time they have left, and what to expect on the other side is very frankly discussed. This sort of thing may be prevalent in a Christian film, but not so much in Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, there's no eye-opening or deep philosophical meaning to be found here. It's just more of candidly presenting two popular belief systems that we have in the world, 1. there is a God, or 2. there is no God. Can you guess which character believes what? Remember, Freeman played God in two movies recently.

The performances of Jack and Morgan are what you would expect, predictable but brilliant. I also enjoyed Sean Hayes' (Will and Grace) comedic performance as Thomas (Ed's personal assistant), his witty one-liners and calm comebacks to Jack Nicholson's crude remarks were priceless. Morgan's character asks him at one point in the film what he prefers to be called Tom or Thomas. He replies Matthew, but Ed calls him Thomas because Matthew sounded too biblical for him. Of course Thomas is another biblical name, but maybe that was to add the ironic humor to the moment or just a reflection on the writer's lack of biblical knowledge.

There are more subplots involved that have to do with both of the lives of the main characters, but this was sort of unpredictable and I don't want to give away too much. Plus I think that the basic premise of the movie sells itself enough for you to want to watch it anyway. The side effects of cancer treatment and chemotherapy especially were presented well, I went through chemo myself and I really felt for these guys who were only pretended to experience it. Surely this film is a future classic; I know that I'll be watching this over and over for years to come.

3258188,5,B000YAF4MA,"I disclose that I actually purchased this Bucket List dvd (Starring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson) from my job for just 5 dollars at least over three to four months ago. This movie stars Jack Nicholson as billionaire hospital businessman Edward Cole and Morgan Freeman as a hard working car mechanic named Carter Chambers who also has a passion for history. Both Edward Cole and Carter Chambers strike up an unexpected friendship after meeting in a hospital while fighting for their lives. Ironically enough, Edward Cole is rushed to the hospital after having a meeting pertaining to his business dealings with a hospital. Carter Chambers if first shown eventually being rushed to the hospital after successfully answering some trivia questions given to him by a coworker and mentioning about Tesla. There is also a cultural reference to the Divine Comedy in this film. Edward Cole has led a very successful material life, but his relationships have been another story. Meanwhile, Carter Chambers loves his wife Virginia Chambers (Beverly Todd0 and other members of his family a lot. However, Chambers decides to go on a bucket list trip with Cole because all of mostly his grown life has been spent putting others before himself. Chambers realizes that he wants to use some of his remaining months to enjoy his life before he dies. One of the touching scenes in the film is where the character of Cole is shown diplomatically but firmly insisting to his doctor that he also asks Chambers if he has any health questions as well instead of leaving him to wait longer than needed for the other doctor. Some of the adventures that Edward Cole and Carter Chambers go on together involve bungee jumping and going on a safari via seeing some animals. Coles assistant Matthew (Sean Hayes) helps tend to Coles end of life business dealings and the bucket list trip. The following features to this film are; movie trailers for Semi-Pro, Bernard and Doris, Mamas Boy, and Get Smart. The Screenwriter of Bucket List (under the special feature of Writing A Bucket List) explains the idea behind why he decided to script The Bucket List (Mario Sorrenti is credited to have played a role in directing the Bucket List). There is also an additional bonus of getting more special features if this dvd is inserted in the dvd rom player of a personal computer. Last,, but not least, this dvd has a special feature of the music video for Say What You Need To Say by John Mayer (including scenes for the movie).",1437091200,,2494,4.829439252336448

3258503,5,B000YAF4MA,"On my 5th viewing, if you listen carefully to the script there is alot of gems to still gain from this movie. A movie's greatness is often measured by how much it impacts ourselves, our own lives, whether it prompts us to change. This one is a must. Both character has some sort of regret... Carter missing out on becoming history teacher and college because first child came early... Edward's regret is his failed relationship w his daughter, the only person he really cares about. And then terminal cancer comes along to shock you and remind you about life's fragility. The impact of this movie is probably how it moved a generation of people to explore their own ""Buckets List"", what it means to do something, to want something, and then go out and find it or explore it or visit it, or see it... when their trip of exploratory is finished, they both return home to the reality of their given lives... a home, a family in Carter's case, and a mean nothing business venture in Edwards case, the latter's lack of connection w others in terms of deep relationships become more profound, meanwhile Carter's return home to his own family reminds him of what really matters... when one's time is coming up short. This movie is a Classic, because it dares to capture a tough subject, and it handles it gently w a sense of reality, humanity, and lastly a light touch of comedy.

Update July 2016. Wow, has it really been 8 years since I saw and reviewed this movie? A measure of a movie is how long its impression stays w you over time, and I can say after 8 years, this movie and its message has stayed w me, and continues to be one of my top all time movies, mainly due of its human message, that we are all mortal, struck between the bookend of our own death, whether we are suddenly struck w cancer or otherwise, and the theme of a buckets list, continues to resonate w me in my own life, things I wanna do, places I wanna go to, and visit, and experience before I kick the bucket. Don't we all have these secret destinations? Dare we accomplish them or most of them, before we kick the bucket? This movie makes you ponder about your own life choices, and how you wish to live it, like no other movie. Believe me, this movie and its themes has stayed w me since I first saw it in 2008.",1420675200,,2284,4.36150234741784

We laughed out loud, shed a few tears and put it on our ""watch again and again"" list.  I can't imagine anyone not thoroughly enjoying this movie. A very different role for Jack Nicholson and yet he was true to form - a great actor. Pairing him with Morgan Freeman was pure genius.

3258646,4,B000YAF4MA,"The Bucket List is a movie about two old men who find out that they are terminally ill and decide to live their life to the fullest.  It was directed by Rob Reiner who is also known for Alex & Emma which I will be reviewing some time later.  As far as this movie goes it was written by Justin Zackham.

This was another movie which was a step out of my comfort zone but I feel that is the only way that I am going to grow as a critic.  It starts off with Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) who is a mechanic working then he gets a phone call and ends up back in the hospital.  He is married and has three children who he loves dearly but lately feels a little disconnected from.  Then we get to billionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) who owns many hospitals, and is single because he has been through many marriages and he also has a daughter that won't talk to him.  Edward find's himself winding up in one of his own hospitals and due to his own work ethics, his hospital puts him in the same room as Carter, instead of giving him his own room.  During their time together the two become very close and then they both find out how much time they have left.  Edward finds Carter's 'bucket list' on the ground which lists everything that he wants to do before he dies and he decides to add to it.  He then invites Carter to join him on the most amazing journey this new friendship could offer.

This scene where they are about to jump out of the plane is by far one of my favorite in the movie.  There is a part where Edward refers to his second wife as the sequel and he wonders why she hated him so much and one of the sky divers says maybe its because you called her the sequel.

Both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman worked really well together on this.  They make you believe that they are both terminally ill and on a journey to live their final days on an adventure to complete an awesome bucket list.  I think it helps that the two of them are both the same age because it adds to how genuine the movie feels.

Overall I would give this movie a B.  The acting and chemistry was great but there were some other aspects of the movie that really stood out that bothered me and that was during the car chase when the cars would magically keep losing their dents and also some scenes Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson's makeup was not put on great and you could notice it.  Other than that check it out because the story is great!",1412640000,,2434,4.164529914529915

3258651,1,B000YAF4MA,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after reading so many good reviews about it. The theme also sounded like it would be fun and endearing and Jack Nicholson is one of my fav all time actors. What it ended up being was a huge disappointment.

How anyone can call this movie ""hilarious"" or that Freeman and Nicholson had such ""good chemistry"" together, is a total mystery

The acting seemed stilted and contrived, the two lead characters never seemed to bond as real friends.

It's also VERY depressing with a lot of emphasis on the ""miracles"" of modern medicine that in the end were of no use to either of these men. As a person who lives a drug-free life, I was hoping this would be about giving the Grim Reaper a run for his money at the end, maybe a ""second chance"" for at least one of the characters, healthwise and with LOTS of laughs and funny scenes to enjoy. Not....on all counts!

This one is headed for the library free box. Give this one a miss unless you like to watch depressing, badly acted movies.

3258653,5,B000YAF4MA,"Two men, one a filthy rich, entitled and not an especially nice guy (Jack Nicholson) and one really nice, laid back mechanic who can answer most Jeopardy questions (Morgan Freeman) share a hospital room when both are undergoing treatment for cancer.  When both receive bad news about their progress, they decide to put together a bucket list and experience life for the remaining time they have left.

I loved this movie, both their experiences in the hospital as well as when traveling the world.  Both are affected by the relationship with the other and become a better person because of it.  I was surprised by Sean Hayes as it took me a while to recognize him as the verbally abused assistant to Nicholsons character.  Really enjoyed how he deals with his boss.  I actually felt a little uplifted when the movie ended.

3258768,5,B000YAF4MA,"Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman...now there's a powerhouse!  This generation's ""The Defiant Ones""!  This film should have done better then it did.  It should have swept the Oscars, destroyed all box office records, and be declared among the greatest films of all time!  But, even if it was denied these accolades, it is still a fine film.  Our leads play a pair of men, previously unknown to one another, who become hospital roommates as they both learn that they have terminal cancer.  Deciding to make their remaining time count, they set out on an around-the-world trip, one of them being rich enough to easily finance the venture for the pair and his assistant/butler/verbal punching bag ""Thomas"", played by Sean Hayes...I actually found the explanation of this character's name to be among the funniest parts of the movie.  This film worked because of the chemistry that Freeman and Nicholson built up throughout their time together...you could see their friendship rise and fall with each passing event.  I don't know much, if anything, about Beverly Todd, but I felt she was just there so Morgan Freeman could have a wife.  I just don't like it when there's a couple on the screen and we only get to know one person and the other one's just...there.  I don't care if the story wasn't about her...she still deserves a real personality.  But that's my only complaint.  This was still a really great and funny film.  To bad it just didn't do better.

In the first five minutes you get the whole story.  So maybe just watch that and spare yourself the rest.

3258839,5,B000YAF4MA,"Car mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is at the garage tinkering with a Chevrolet Camaro - cigarette in his gob like it always has been for 45 years. He smiles as his younger co-worker quizzes him on five former American Presidents whose surnames begin with H (Carter has a thing for accumulating knowledge). He of course gets their names right. But then mid explanation on the next question (which man actually invented the radio) - his Doctor phones with test results - and the cigarette that was placed between Carter's fingers to take the call falls to the greasy floor...

Meanwhile in a courtroom far away - four-times married multi-millionaire Edward Penniman Cole (Jack Nicholson) is assimilating hospital number 16 into his privatized portfolio. Sipping his Indonesian Kopi Luwak (the most expensive coffee in the world) from a Gold mobile dispenser - he asks his puppet assistant to give the panel of trustees ""the spiel..."" Their financially failing Hospital needs him and no matter what their 'moral posturing' maybe - in his moneymaking medical palaces there are two beds to every room for patients (no exceptions). But in the middle of another crass speech about how he's running a hospital and not a health spa - Edward suddenly starts to cough something into his handkerchief that isn't phlegm...

Next both wildly different men find themselves lumped together in the same room of a Hospital Edward Cole owns. But because of bad PR - the grouchy Cole can't get a private room to be away from ""the living dead over there"". Gradually across chemo, operations, puking and diarrhoea - they become reluctant buddies of sorts. One day Edward finds a yellow jotter page on the floor on which Carter has written ""The Bucket List"". It's what his former college tutor told him to write as a young man - things you want to do before you 'kick the bucket'...

Recovered momentarily and now with a diagnosis of 6 months and one year respectively - Edward persuades Carter not to go home to his Nurse wife Veronica and his three kids to be swallowed by pity and grief - but to take a shot at all the things he's wanted to do. After all money is not a problem. And despite his wife's misgivings - Carter knows Edward is right. It's now or never. So they skydive, get a tattoo, drive a Mustang Shelby 360, laugh until they cry, kiss the most beautiful woman in the world, witness something majestic...and so on.

Part of the joy of ""The Bucket List"" is watching two acting giants given great material - let rip with it - and that's what you get here. The chemistry and obvious respect between Freeman and Nicholson leaps off every frame and Director Rob Reiner never interferes - even when the film is being silly and a little preposterous. In fact in the first 30 or 40 minutes as they navigate the physical and mental agonies of terminal illness in a Hospital - ""The Bucket List"" is truly touching movie-making - with a razor-sharp script and life observations that don't feel obvious nor too cutesy.

Even in the second-half where the story demands they do their comedy party pieces - the conversations between them on Cole's private jet and in a luxurious hotel bathtub are filled with classy one-liners and power delivery (beautifully scripted by Justin Zackham). And it's funny too (most of which is provided by the incomparable Jack Nicholson). By the time it gets to The Shawshank Redemption Morgan Freeman voiceover end - when a Chock-Full-Of-Nuts tin is being carried up a mountain - you're a willing convert.

This is major Hollywood movie and the picture quality on the BLU RAY is simply glorious. Defaulted to 1.85:1 Full Aspect - the frame fills the entire screen and there isn't a shot that doesn't look immaculate and impressive. Even the CGI of the chat about his daughter Emily on top of the Pyramids is convincing (title above) - as is the motorbike ride on the Great Wall of China and their walks around the Taj Mahal. Audio is Dolby Digital English, French and Spanish 5.1 for each - while the Subtitles offered are English, French and Spanish.

The Extras are delightful - interviews with both leads, Director Ron Reiner, the Screenwriter, a Making of and John Mayer's gorgeous acoustic balled ""Say"".

As he treks through snow keeping a promise to a man he first despised but then grew to love - Carter Chambers says of Edward Cole - ""When he died...his eyes were shut...and his heart was open...""

""The Bucket List"" has been a joy to re-watch on BLU RAY. Do yourself a solid - and open your bruised ticker to this modern-day nugget...",1396742400,,4565,4.7320754716981135

Both actors were wonderful in this movie. It was moving but not too mussy, many of life's cold hard facts were presented. One will enjoy following both men on their adventures and it hits home when we realize how fast our lifetime goes and how much of it the average person wishes they could do over, just to explore our dreams.  The chemistry between the two actors also adds to this film. I would recommend it to young and old. There is profanity but no sexual contend or violence.",1390953600,,622,4.408695652173913

Nicholson and Freeman were a marvelous pairing and incredibly funny despite the weighty subject matter.  Had a wonderful time with the family and we laughed until we cried.  My only regret is the seemingly unavoidable use of foul language.  Had this movie been made in the 40's, it would have been just as funny and just as weighty without bad language.  However, in all honesty, the language aspect is sadly more of a commentary on the state of our contemporary society than it is about movie-making.  That said, rent or buy this movie and enjoy it with your adult family members, especially if you're like me and take PG-13 to mean ""not recommended for viewers under 30 years of age"".",1388793600,,795,4.895522388059701

Plenty of mental/emotional warfare going on here.  It's good when people get what they want.  And, go where they want.  But, it's even better when they become who they want.

The story is heart-warming and sad at the same time. There are many moments to treasure and lessons to learn. But do not thing that this will be a serious undertaking, since there are plenty of comedic moments to carry us along and provide balance to the dramatic ones.

I really liked it alot. Morgan and Jack made a great team. I bought and gave the DVD to myself as a high school graduation gift, and I watch it every chance I get. However, in my opinion I feel it was a movie that should have been rated R due to that the ""F"" word was used in it, but on the other hand it was only used once. If you have enjoyed ""The Bucket List"", you would also like, ""Folks"" starring Tom Sellek and Don Ameche, ""Grumpy Old Men"", ""Grumpier Old Men"", and ""Secondhand Lions"".

3259251,5,B000YAF4MA,Two of the best...Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.  I did not see this movie when it was released. Morgan Freeman is a champion of an actor and Jack Nicholson is superb. and He showed a little of the personality that he portrayed in the movie...A Few Good Men. Every scene int the Bucket List is important and contributes to the ending...If you go the the kitchen for popcorn or a snack...pause the movie...so that you don't miss anything...The ending is a surprise and I will not spoil it for you....I give this movie 10 Stars.,1372464000,,530,4.578947368421052

3259275,5,B000YAF4MA,"What I expected to be a rather interesting, sometimes funny, but also deeply depressing film ended up being much the opposite. The bucket list ended up being a life affirming film from start to finish. It's not about death, it's really about life. Living life to the fullest and setting things right. It's a film about two men standing at the door to death and deciding it's time to really live life for the first time before they die. The characters Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play are such complete opposites, yet they had something in common that they understood. Working together they find the courage and meaning to live out their last days doing the things they never did in all their years on earth, and in only 3 months they ended up doing more than most people do in a lifetime. And along the way they came to understand what true frienhship, love, and forgivness are really all about. I am so greatful to Rob Reiner for making this film because exploring the subject of death and telling a story of hope at the same time is a tough nut to crack. But this film succeeds in telling a story that needed to be told and doing so in such a wonderful way. In the end the message was loud and clear for me. Live life to the fullest and make peace with those you love, leaving all grudges behind forever . That is why I am giving 'The bucket list' 5 stars. It's a beautiful, inspiring story found in the most unilkely circumstance",1371427200,,1438,4.409774436090226

The movie features two aging men, with completely different backgrounds, who find solace with each other as they're in the hospital ward. They come up with a list of places they want to see, and activities they need to do, while they're still here on Earth. Of course there are some of the most common destinations on their list, but it's still fun to see them do it all. Some of the things on their list get completed, but not in the way they were expecting.

3259299,3,B000YAF4MA,"It was entertaining. I thought that the most important thing that happened in the movie was that each of them learned how better to love another which impacted more lives than their own. I thought their religious views were devoid of any value. But they seemed to view life like many Americans, so maybe that was the goal of the director/writer, to connect with the audience?
I have to say that I pray to God that I would not spend my last days trying to grab the gusto of the secular dream. I thought that they missed the point of life. I was saved about 9 years ago at age 53 and my priorities are undergoing a major shift as I become more familiar with the Bible.

If you have not read through the Bible, I pray that you might consider it. Before I did, I had spent at least two decades investigating eastern religion, philosophy, and psychology, only to become a fence sitter because I could not derive any meaning out of anything I had experienced. I had been a Bahai for about 5 years and studied Zen for at least that long. Although I had read parts of the Bible numerous times, I did not read through it until my 3rd marriage crashed and burned. God lifted me up out of the wreckage of that and gave me the interest to read through the Bible. I was finally able to believe in creationism. Formerly, I thought creationism and evolution were both fantastic theories that took more faith than I had to believe....

If I had written a story about what I was going to do with my last few months of life, it would have been far different than this.",1369180800,,1550,4.304794520547945

3259372,5,B000YAF4MA,"Last night's movie was ""The Bucket List"" DVD, a simple story, well told. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were  superb in their leading roles. Hats off to the directing by Rob Reiner. Basically, Nicholson and Freeman meet in a hospital (owned by Nicholson) and both are expected to die within a year. They jointly decide to make up a list of things to do before they kick the bucket, and off they go on an around-the-world adventure supported by the immense wealth of Nicholson. The DVD cover bills it as ""Hysterically Funny"" and I got a lot of good chuckles out of it, to be sure. However, I found the film to be immensely sad, perhaps aided by the fact that I'm now approaching 77 and can faintly perceive my own bucket sitting out there on the distant horizon. Well, it's something we all face and it's a good thing to think about, no matter what your age might be. We all need a Bucket List.

Some of the things on the bucket list are just standard, like traveling to distant Africa to view the wildlife, hiking in the Himalayas or driving a race car. Some are border-line crazy, like sky diving. No matter, it's a funny list and you'll be chuckling as you work your way through it. Some are simple but touching, like laughing so hard that you cry. Well, who hasn't done that? My guess would be quite a few. It's both a touching and funny movie. In their adventure and their growing friendship they also decide what to do with their remains and they both disdain conventional solutions and end up with their ashes stashed in a couple old coffee cans in a beautiful local. This is an excellent movie, one of the best I've seen in months and months. I can't believe I purchased the DVD for about five bucks.

It was a little sappy, but it's wonderful to see a master story teller tell an old story-- what it means to live well and die well -- in a new way that brings meaning to the audience and the characters.  Each of the two powerful leads held his own against the equally-strong other.
The scenery was gorgeous, but the profundity of feeling underlying the characters' reckoning with their lives resonate with me as much as the sights they saw together.  And the last line of the film was a belly laugh.",1360454400,,628,4.491228070175438

3259432,1,B000YAF4MA,"This was a good story and should have been a good movie.  It had scenes in other countries.

I would have given more stars if it had not been spoiled for us because Jack Nicholson
continued to use Jesus Christ's name as a form of extreme displeasure of different events.

For serious Christians, this will be hurtful, unacceptable, and disturbing to say the least!
It was disrespectful to the actual historical Jesus and what he did for everyone who believe in Him.

Morgan Freeman was a Christian and tried to help Nicholson's character see the truth.
I enjoyed Freeman's character and how he portrayed it.

It was unnecessary to limit the ENJOYABLE viewing of such an otherwise good movie to those who do not love Jesus.

I do not write many reviews, but after paying to buy this movie based on the awards and usually good actors, I feel sad and bad.

I don't know what to do with the DVD now.  I can't give it away or even donate it to Good Will or the library because I won't be the cause of anyone else hearing Nicholson use the the Lord's name in that way!",1358812800,6,1062,4.38265306122449

Never have two such magnificent actors, both gifted with immense natural talent, taken so long to accomplish so little.  The only way they could have achieved less would be to talk longer.",1346112000,,444,4.8933333333333335

3259612,4,B000YAF4MA,"Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are room-mates in a hospital that Cole actually owns. He insisted he was running a hospital and not a vacation spa, and there were no private rooms. Two patients to a room, no exceptions.

They both have cancer, and both have terminal diagnoses. So Cole, who has way more money than he knows what to do with, proposes they spend their remaining time doing all the things they want to do before they die. The term ""Bucket List"" came from a professor where Carter went to college who asked them to compose such a list as a philosophy class exercise.

So they do it. Some of the scenes are pretty funny, such as their skydiving adventure, their driving race cars, and so on. But it is also very thoughtful as they sit in a classy restaurant over caviar and talk about family matters.

I won't spoil it by telling you what happens, but one item stands out. While in India visiting the Taj Mahal, they talk about funeral plans. Carter says he wants to be cremated, his ashes put in a tin can and buried somewhere wild. ""Like a Chock Full of Nuts can?"" jokes Cole, ""The heavenly coffee!""

3259613,2,B000YAF4MA,"Miss-matched buddy dramedies are a dime a dozen these days.  Very rarely do they star two juggernaut actors like Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.  Very rarely are they this devoid of merit.  I'm bewildered at how poorly conceived this film was, when you consider the names involved.  I really wanted to see this.  Sure, it looked corny and unappealing on the outset, but it also stars one of the greatest actors ever (Nicholson) and one of the more understated and nuanced of his generation (Freeman), so the possibilities were endless here.  Instead of challenging these two men to provide us with something insightful and profound, we are left with a film that casts Nicholson as the loudmouthed jerk and Freeman as the quietly sincere `wise' soul.  Seriously, why are such great actors relegated to playing the same character in every film?  Why couldn't Nicholson be the quiet one for a change?  Why can't we see Morgan Freeman boss people around and show lack of personal regard for everyone around him?  I just want something to differentiate this from the last dozen movies these two have starred in.  YUCK.  Seriously, this is saccharine to the hilt, and the forced upon comedic aspects feel redundant and underwhelming.  Thankfully, even when handed the same boring predictable loaf of a character these actors seem to do their best with the role, so they make it at least somewhat watchable (they have great chemistry), but this is a generic story with no arc that isn't 100% predictable.  I just want to slap someone in the face right now.",1333065600,6,1552,4.85171102661597

The idea of fulfilling a list of things to do before you die obviously gained some traction after the 2007 release of this film. The movie features two of our finest ""older"" actors in a script that doesn't really challenge them or the viewer, but it's still an entertaining and thought-provoking film. It gets better with subsequent viewings. I especially enjoyed the DVD special feature in which screenwriter Justin Zackham explains the genesis of the script; it came from his own genuine Bucket List.",1332115200,,621,4.867924528301887

The Bucket List does almost all of that. It's not a fast paced action movie, so I wasn't on the edge of my seat like Avatar, Saving Private Ryan, The Patriot, or Gladiator, but this is an incredible story.

Two men have a chance meeting. Their friendship struggles to get started, but evolves into a bond like Superglue and sets in motion a series of events that address all the characteristics above.

If you know someone with a temrinal illness, have days where you feel down, or simply need a pick-me-up, this is a must see. It is a moving and inspiring film for all generations.",1331596800,,739,4.541353383458647

3259639,5,B000YAF4MA,I originally saw this movie in the theater and decided that it was one that I wanted to add to my DVD collection.  This is both an entertaining and thought provoking movie. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson most certainly rank highly among the great actors of our time.  The sobering story of illness and looming end of life is conveyed with humor and warmth.  It has made me think about what I want on my own Bucket List.,1331424000,,422,4.384615384615385
3259640,3,B000YAF4MA,"I had purchased this movie, and in my opinion, enjoyed it!  I love Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson as actors and found their chemistry on screen worth wild.  Initially the previews of the movie looked stupid and not up my ally, It was not one I wanted to initially purchase, but I was surprized when I watched the movie for the first time.

The movie is about 2 men, who led seperate lives until Nicholson found out he had cancer.  (Nicholson plays a man that owns / runs a string of Hospitals on a cost cutting basis.  Freeman is a retired auto mechanic.)  Subsequently Nicholson get's treatment in one of his own hospitals and Freeman is his roommate.  On this premise the movie does start out a little slow to the get go, and can be a little sad or depressing.  The base topic is something that has touched many peoples lives.

As the movie progresses, the 2 men become close friends.  They decided to do the ""Bucket List"" which is a list that Freeman had started in the hospital.  The humor does pick up at times, and you can't help but laugh at a few points through out the movie.

Towards the end it does get back to reality, with them both getting sick at different times, and both surcoming to cancer.  And at the end both are burried in a coffee can next to each other.

Personally feel the movie has an OK beggining, fun middle, and a sad ending, may not have been an Oscar type of movie, but I think it was worth the purchase!",1330214400,,1439,4.301115241635688

3259645,1,B000YAF4MA,"2007 film. I thought I'd be nasty and give one star. Because....
[1] The two main characters are too synthetic. Nicholson as a billionaire in hospitals - a field noted for groups operating illegally. Not at all realistic, and the character is absurd - more or less acquaintance-less, perhaps to keep the cost down; and also without anything one imagines billionaires to have, from sophistication (there's a drawn-out thing with a type of coffee he would certainly know the details of) to grasp of his business and will. The other one is a sort of Nelson Mandela type, not showing the sorts of characteristics noted by US blacks. In the same way blacks are promoted as athletes - for want of anything else - this character is shown as a TV quiz type, quoting simple-minded factoids, though the script does allow a bit of play there.
[2] The events are too obviously selected to be tear-jerking, like some guilty person making up a story about a dying relative as an excuse. This is of course is a standard technique; it doesn't really work here, because of the extreme contrasts of the operations, shaved heads, near-death, and stumbling around in hospital clothing stuff, with the going round the world material. As is a Hollywood standard, the black character is morally impecable, turning down, for example, a sh*g with a woman presumably paid by Nicholson. Some of the regret material seemed better, but, well...
[3] The effects didn't quite work... the scenes trying to race cars showed the characters talking to each other through open windows; and with obviously implausible stunt scenes. The landscapes look processed and fake - an 'Egyptian monument' was some studio thing.

The bonus material includes a chat with scriptwriter - one of whose ambitions was to get a film made 'by a major studio'. Possibly worth a look by would-be scriptwriters. I wonder why actors, who after all must have some experience of the world, never seem to write anything. Maybe it's just easier to get a call from an agent, read up a bit, and turn up to do your takes and retakes.",1328313600,5,2067,4.7899159663865545

3259693,5,B000YAF4MA,"Well after reading the various reviews here it is quite apparent that while most like and love this movie, there never-the-less are those who do not.  Number me with those who is quite fond of it.  You can tell that by the fact that I have viewed in three times and I am one of those people who NEVER see a movie I like or dislike a second time.

The overall plot has been done to death there with plenty of spoilers for all.  I would be sort of redundant of me to give you a blow by blow account of the movie.  There are quite a number of well written reviews to choose from here so it you want to know all about the movie without having to bother watching it; read one of them.

Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and I have never watched a movie of his that I did not like, or at least like the part he was playing.  Freeman has been given some horrid scripts to work with over the years and despite the fact that he has played in some real losers (Hey, they guy has to make a living you know), he has always come though and I have never seen him give a bad performance.  Now this movie is good and his teaming up with Jack was perfect.  They played off of each other perfectly.

Now some have said this is a sad film and indeed, there are aspects of it that are sad.  But that being said, sad though death may be, it is still a part of life; as big a part of life as birth and living when you stop and think about it.  Evan though there were most certainly sad parts of this film, there were also some very, very funny scenes and I found myself laughing quite a lot as the story unfolded.

None of us want to die; I know I am not overly fond of the idea myself, but I know I am eventually going to do so.  I just hope I can face the big final scene with the class these two portrayed in the movie.

The Bucket List I had heard a lot about but never really gave it much thought one way or the other.  But the late night movie bug caught and it was available, so I finally got my chance to see it.

When billionaire hospital owner Edward Cole ends up in his own hospital, he never expects to make a friend in auto-mechanic Carter Chambers.  However, the two do strike up an unlikely bond and on the spur of a moment decision, after being handed their ""death sentences"" for cancer, they decide to fulfill a bucket list.  Or rather a list of things to do before they kick the bucket.  They go sky diving, travel the world, but eventually Carter realizes he should be at home with his family.  Edward is not so confident in this change of events though and isn't sure how to take it when Carter tries to give him the same gift of realization.  They both don't have that long to live, but its still hard to decide what to do with their lives.

Characters:
Edward Cole: Jack Nicholson
Carter Chambers: Morgan Freeman

I really like these two actors but don't think that this is their best performances ever.  They still do a good job but while polar opposites of each other at times, sometimes it seemed a little too contrived.  Freeman's character was a little too sage while Nicholson's was a little too out there to be believable sometimes.  Still, it was nice to see them pal around.

For a plot this moved along pretty good.  It was interesting, albeit a bit unbelievable at times but since its a movie I'm allowing to suspend reality for a bit.  It was interesting to see some of the stuff on the bucket list, although it seems a lot of it would be standard for everyone (go on safari, travel the world, etc.) but some of it was unique to the characters and that was nice.  Some of the scenes were a little cheesy and you could tell they were backdrops instead of the actual place which was a surprising thing to me considering when the movie was made.  I also don't remember much of the music which means that it must have just been background filler.

Not a bad movie but not the most excellent either of these two have done.  I'd probably watch it again.

3259712,4,B000YAF4MA,"When Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson get together to co-star in a film, there's no way it's going to be a dud.  The Bucket List lived up to my expectations of being a well-written movie with good acting, nice camera work, etc.

The story line of the movie is touching and is likely pull at the heart strings of most people.  However, though the subject matter of the film is pretty depressing, it is dealt with in a relatively lighthearted way which keeps the film from being too gloomy to be enjoyable.

Priced under $10, the DVD is a well-priced and worth buying if this is a movie that you're interested in adding to your collection.

The DVD has some special features, including an interview with the screenplay writer of The Bucket List.  It also has interactive features.  However, the features don't seem to work on Mac computers and getting them to work on a PC also seems to be an uphill battle.  When I loaded the disc onto my PC, it turned out that I would have needed to download all sorts of Windows Media patches, etc. etc. to get the features to work, so I gave up.  Instead of spending time messing with my computer to try to get the disc to work, I decided that I should spend the time working on my own bucket list.",1308441600,,1235,4.358078602620087

3259718,4,B000YAF4MA,"'The Bucket List' is a film showing two masters of their art in fine form. Both Nicholson and Freeman manage to pull off the perfect mix of comedy and poignancy in this film without becoming too cheesy or schmaltzy. The premise is actually very simply (2 terminally ill patients working their way through their own Bucket list) but manages to capture their relationships, fears about dying, philosophy about life and more besides in it's short but very sweet 90 minutes. I was kept thoroughly engaged the whole time and enjoyed every minute as they worked their way through a variety of experiences, from sky diving, getting a tattoo, to kissing the most beautiful girl in the world and a whole host of other things. This made for a fun film, with the right elements of humour and sadness and made a serious point about relishing your life without hammering the point home. It left me wondering about what experiences I've yet to try and with an all round good feeling. You can't ask much more from a film really. Great story, great acting and well worth a try.

3259729,4,B000YAF4MA,"I don't normally pick comedies, but was very happily surprised by this one.  Two guys bond while sharing a hospital room, sharing terminal cancer.  There is real chemistry between them, a give and take by two men who have virtually nothing in common.  One is a hard-nosed businessman, the other a mechanic with a wonderful self-taught mind.

The plot revolves about a list of things they want to do before their time is up.  Nicolson is rich, so he invites Freeman on a tour of the world, where they skydive, attempt to trek in the Himalayas, and stay in exotic locales, crossing things off the list as more and more is revealed about the characters' lives.  They change each other and then make major steps in their lives.

Sure, this is a tried and true formula, but these actors pull it off with true originality and excellence.  I laughed, was moved, and delighted in the philosophy of life that emerges through the journey of the film.  It is genuinely beautiful and very fun.

3259730,2,B000YAF4MA,"I wish I could say I enjoyed this movie and was worth paying to watch, but I honestly cannot.  In drama there is a phrase regarding the viewer having a ""willful suspense of disbelief.""  I never found that possible due to poor chemistry between Nicholson and Freeman in this disjointed, predictable storyline.

I really think the topic is decent, it does not have to be so scary one cannot find their own humor in it, but as a viewer I felt as though it (and I) were disrespected and dumbed down.

Seriously, both of these older gentlemen have BRAIN surgery and recover in no time perfectly with all brain function intact?  They have none of the ongoing issues of Cancer patients with fatigue, etc.?  How realistic is it Freeman receives the call at work that he has Cancer, especially when his wife is a nurse?  One scene Nicholson tears up the bucket list and in another scene they are writing on it again!  I found myself terribly distracted by these odd moments.

I love a good heartwarming story, especially those with a solid message you can take with you, where you see a lives transformed (like Shawshank Redemption or The Blind Side).  This is not one of those movies.

I cannot recommend this movie, there are far better stories out there to watch than this one.",1295481600,2,1271,4.579646017699115

The veteran actors who portray these two guys basically play themselves, with Nicholson the eccentric extrovert and Freeman the dignified philosopher.

3259738,4,B000YAF4MA,"The phrase ""the bucket list"" has become part of our culture.  The concept is to make a list of all the things you want to do before you die and then do them.  Seems like a good idea.

This 2008 film, staring Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is based on this concept.  These two men are fine actors.  They bring their years of experience, subtleties of expression and past fame to their roles of two terminally ill cancer patients who meet in the hospital and then go off to live their dreams before they die. Nicholson is the rich one who can finance all sorts of adventures for the two of them.  Freeman is the hardworking family man who has worked all his life as a mechanic and never got a chance for a formal education. Together they make a good team and their performances are excellent.

The script, however, leaves much to be desired.  First of all, it is NOT a comedy although its publicity makes it seem so.  Second of all, it is just not real.  Terminally ill patients don't have the stamina to go sky diving, big game hunting in Africa, etc.  Freeman's life is all family and just too sickly sweet.  Nicholson's final reconciliation with a daughter who hates him contains no surprises.  And the film itself, instead of being uplifting, is actually sort of depressing.

However, this movie has one big redeeming value.  It makes a person think about his or her own life and what is really important.  And if a film can do that, it has achieved something more than just plain entertainment.",1291939200,,1500,4.5

3259761,3,B000YAF4MA,"I should have loved this film. I really like Nicholson and Freeman. I also enjoy a good dramedy, even those about death -- one of my all-time favorites is Better Off Dead. It must be very difficult to pull off funny when the subject is death, so to do so is impressive. The Bucket List tries, and sometimes gets very close... but I didn't love this film. It was okay. I don't regret the time invested, but, I'm not adding it to my library.

Why?

There was a manipulative feel to it, at times too much emotion, and others a lack that seemed extreme even when taking the grieving process into account. And I really didn't like the characters. The actors did a great job with the material. But there were moments where I ended up scratching my head and wondering where the inappropriate emotion was coming from, or how in the world that choice was made. I will admit that I just lost a near dear one to lung cancer and the hospital scenes were tough to watch. But I don't think that affected my feelings about the characters.

Freeman plays a hard-working, responsible family man, Carter. He's sacrificed his whole life for his family. Nicholson plays the part of a rich playboy, Edward. Edward owns the hospital where Carter is living during cancer treatment. Edward is diagnosed with cancer and ends up as Carter's roommate because Edward is infamous for publicly stating from his soapbox that ""there are no private rooms etc.etc."" Predictably, they hate sharing and each other until treatment and struggles bring them together in a brotherhood of the suffering and dying. They begin a bucket list...""things to do before I kick the bucket."" Actually, Carter does and the items on the list are evidence of his life of responsibility and service. But then Edward and his deep pockets get involved and the adventure is on.

I struggled with Carter's embracing of some of Edward's foolishness. I didn't like Carter's wife which was probably the goal otherwise Carter would have just looked selfish for taking off on the mad adventure around the world. Maybe I've been wrong about things. I always thought that I'd look back and feel that my life made a difference in others' lives because of relationship, not because of my experiences and exploits. Ultimately, that is kind of the end message. But it takes a long, twisted road to get there.",1289952000,,2338,4.709046454767726

Can two terminally ill men who are complete strangers with different personalities and backgrounds enjoy an adventure-packed vacation during some of the last months of their lives?  The answer is yes, if you're in the movies where remission, money, and wit can come at the drop of a screenwriter's pen.

Jack Nicholson's character had the money, while Morgan Freeman's character had a lifetime of knowledge; so much so that I wondered why appearing on Jeopardy didn't top the so called bucket list.  But while the extent of their vacation and list of things to do before they ""kicked the bucket"" was extreme, their growing appreciation for one another and effect on each other's lives were realistic enough to make an impact.

And while this movie was not one of Nicholson's funniest, the movie was a real joy to watch.  It will make you think about the value of life, death, family loyalty, and everlasting friendship.

Nicholson plays Edward Cole, and is rich; Freeman (Carter Chambers) isn't (he's a mechanic).  Chambers is married; Cole is married to his work.  Both are seriously ill, and given months to live.

Morgan Freeman, as usual, is stellar and keeps the movie from being too twee with his sparse, smooth acting.  Jack Nicholson is his usual not-attractive, rumpled, somehow lovable self (reminded me very much of the portrayal he did in his movie Something's Gotta Give with Diane Keaton).  Tommy, the assistant, who puts up with Nicholson's jerky character with aplomb and devotion, brings warmth to Nicholson's character.  It really is a good movie.  I did wonder how the movie would have been if Freeman's and Nicholson's parts had been swapped, a la The Bishop's Wife, with Freeman playing the wealthy man who has everything but not the one thing he wants, and Nicholson playing the warm-hearted, learned man who has given his all and wants a little life for himself.  In the end, it's the characters' personal baggage that gives the movie its weight, and a satisfying ending with a laugh.",1271721600,,1054,4.763736263736264

3259808,5,B000YAF4MA,"Two of my favorite Actors, Morgan Freeman as a retired auto Mechanic and Jack Nicholson get acquainted as terminantly ill cancer patients! The story is the result of Morgan (Charles Chambers) remembering The BUCKET LIST Assignment from his Philosophy Teacher who asked his students to make a list of the things which they would try to accomplish before he ""Kicked The Bucket.""

When Edward Cole found the list begun by his roommate Charles Chambers, they decided that was the best way they could spend their last days! So both asked their Doctors to check them out of their room and their treatment. Since Edward Cole was a wealthy Fortune 500 mogul who owned an interest in hospitals, they chose to attempt their list of things they had never done before. First they wanted to sky dive out of a large plane. They did this and it was a huge thrill! Next they visited Monte Carlo, where they downed great amounts of Caviar and hit the tables. They tore up the road in two supercharged cars in reckless  abandon at great speeds and enormous risks! They visited Africa where they included the beautiful scenery and animals of a Safari! From there they saw the great Egyptian Pyramids. They stayed in famous Hotels in the exotic cities of China & France, etc.

When they returned home, they each celebrated! Edward meeting with his large board of Associates & Directors after he made a difficult, surprise visit, taking flowers to his only estranged daughter after years of silence! Charles met his whole family for a big joint dinner with all of his children & grandchildren!

The crowning scene of the whole story was the celebration of the Memorial Service of Charles' death, where Ed Cole gave the most touching Eulogy ever heard and felt for the man he only had known a few years, yet had given him new desires to stay alive!

Part of Ed & Charles personal touch were the stories they shared! One of the most enduring was the visit that Charles described to a friend after climbing his memorial trip to the top of an ancient Tibetian mountain where he had experienced the most profound silence, so that he felt he heard the Voice of God. The final scene of the Movie was the trip up to the top of that very mountain where he deposited the Urn of Charles' ashes.

3259819,5,B000YAF4MA,"A long time ago, Carter Chambers' philosophy professor suggested that his students compose a ""bucket list,"" a collection of all the things they wanted to do, see and experience in life before they kicked the bucket. But while Carter was trying to define his private dreams and plans, reality intruded. Marriage, children, myriad responsibilities and, ultimately, a 46-year job as an auto mechanic turned his concept of a bucket list into little more than a bittersweet memory of lost opportunities and a mental exercise he occasionally thought about to pass the time. Meanwhile, corporate billionaire Edward Cole never saw a list without a bottom line. He was always too busy making money and building an empire to think about what his deeper needs might be beyond the next big acquisition or cup of gourmet coffee. Then life delivered an urgent and unexpected wake-up call to both of them. Carter and Edward found themselves sharing a hospital room with plenty of time to think about what might happen next--and about how much of that was in their hands. For all their apparent differences, they discovered they had two very important things in common: an unrealized need to come to terms with who they were and the choices they'd made, and a pressing desire to spend the time they had left doing everything they ever wanted to do. So, against doctor's orders and all good sense, these two virtual strangers check themselves out of the hospital and hit the road together for the adventure of a lifetime--from the Taj Mahal to the Serengeti, the finest restaurants to the seediest tattoo parlors, the cockpit of vintage race cars to the open door of a prop plane--with just a sheet of paper and their passion for life to guide them. Adding and crossing items off their list while taking in the grandeur and beauty of the world, they grapple with the difficult questions and the even more difficult answers that plague all of us. And, without even realizing it, become true friends.  This movie is full of well-earned rueful humor. What a gift. Two of the world's greatest actors come together and create movie magic.",1262476800,2,2116,4.861495844875346
3259820,4,B000YAF4MA,"Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson played their characters impecably.  Unfortunately, Nicholsons character's language was unnecessarily vulgar.  That seems to be par for Nicholson.  Therefore, I cannont recommend it for a general audience or someone not use to poddy mouth talk.  As a former U.S.Navy sailer, I have heard similar talk, but do not care for that kind of language.  As an overview, I would say the movie waS entertaining but I will not be viewing it again.",1261353600,,469,5.038961038961039
3259821,5,B000YAF4MA,"I hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years. ANY movie.
As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!
AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!
I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip as well as to have with me to view so I didn't want anything that would be offensive to anyone near me on the plane.

Yes, it's sad, but so are lots of things in life but this is a different kind of sadness. It's a sadness that also comes with great joy because it reached its full cycle and you felt that fulfillment. You also felt its purpose, and the love.

I think for some to comment that it was 'predictable' miss the point. Much in life is predictable. For me, I don't care that some things are predictable; or simplified, or maybe not even 'realistic'. I can get reality in the day to day. To watch a movie is to become involved deeply with so many levels of the movie and to glean from it whatever message you are receiving at that time.

I enjoyed Morgan's wife in the movie and the relationship he had with her. Of course she is going to get mad at him; be frustrated, concerned and then absolutely shocked and bewildered when he announced his plans. But, she also showed great trust, and love and knew that whatever he was needing to do, it's what he needed to do and let it go. Let him go. I enjoyed those intimate scenes. People need to see great strength and trust between two people.

I also found myself hanging on the edge of my seat when Morgan was at the bar and the beautiful lady came up and sat next to him. I found myself thinking that if MORGAN (the actor - not even the character!) 'gave in', then I would change how I felt about him (however irrational since it was his character, not him). I held my breath in anticipation...
Now, whether Morgan had any say so on the outcome of that scene or whether that was how the script was written anyway, it made a world of difference to me. And if Morgan did have a say so, well, all the more reason why I esteem him so highly.

I thought it was a wonderful movie and am so glad I got to see it.",1261267200,,2208,4.113689095127611

3259823,3,B000YAF4MA,"United by a common fate, two terminally ill strangers share a room in a hospital and become the best of friends.  Together, they draw up something called a ""bucket list,"" a catalog of things they've always wanted to do in their lives but somehow never got around to doing.  This includes jumping out of an airplane, getting a tattoo, driving a racecar and touring the planet (luckily, one of them is rich enough to own his own jet) - all before ""kicking the bucket.""

Sort of a ""feel-good"" movie about death, Rob Reiner's ""The Bucket List"" pretty much plays out as one would expect it to, with a predictable and episodic script (by Justin Zackham) that wobbles uncomfortably between whistling-past-the-graveyard humor and courage-in-the-face-of-death sentimental uplift (the latter being particularly evident in  Morgan Freeman's stentorian voiceover narration and Marc Shaiman's tinkling-piano score).

Like the solid professionals they are, Freeman and Jack Nicholson both rise above the cliches of their respective stereotypes: Nicholson's of a gruff, billionaire playboy (true typecasting if ever there was any) who's been successful in all areas of his life except where it really counts, that is to say as a loving husband and father; and Freeman's of a stolid, conservative family man who's never learned to just cut loose and enjoy life to the full.  Now, just as they are about to meet their maker, these two polar opposites get a chance to teach one another valuable lessons on how to make the most of what little time remains to them.

All told, there's nothing particularly striking or memorable about ""The Bucket List,"" but the actors make it worth seeing.",1261094400,,1669,5.091575091575091

The movie had a few sobering moments, granted. But the movie as a whole was funny, very sensitive and heart warming, and Nicholson and Freeman complemented the other in delivering strong performances. The script was well done and the movie pace was quite good, considering what is a rather serious subject matter and in the star's cases, a serious situation.

I recommend it to people who are healthy in particular. We take good health for granted until we find out we have something wrong that stirs us into action or perhaps puts us in the hospital. This movie addresses the lighter side of living life to its fullest and also making the most of what time we do have left, even if we might not have as much as we would like.

However, regular day-to-day stuff usually gets in the way and for some reason we always think there will be time to do it later.  We put off that vacation to save money; plan things we'll do with our kids but the kids grow up and this is a great reminder of taking one day at a time.  This isn't a movie that I expected to enjoy, however I really did like it.  The movie is interesting - enjoyed all the triva that Morgan Freeman knew in his role.  It showed that you should never judge a book by it's cover. Life takes us down different, unexpected roads more times than not and we seldom take the time to find out about a person before we label them.  Sometimes you have to walk a mile in someone else's shoes.  More than anything this movie made me think and made me look at each day differently.  A very entertaining way to teach us all a lesson.

3259841,4,B000YAF4MA,"When this film was first advertised I looked forward to it. Upon release and mixed reviews, I feared the worst. Finally, I laughed in the middle and cried at the end. Maybe reviewers are too young or maybe they're just so scared of death themselves that they don't know how to react without prejudice to a movie that is, at its core, about just plain dying. Maybe I liked this movie because I am 56 years old and yesterday Tim Russert, only 58, died suddenly. This movie gives people in the second half of our lives hope that we may be given a little time to do what we didn't do and smooth over the rough edges of our lives. Yes, the Nicholson character being so wealthy and the working class Freeman character just happening to luck out and meet the rich guy is contrived. But, really, what in a film is not contrived? Isn't that the core of story-telling: making up or choosing a tale to fit the desired message? All movies have a message or movie makers wouldn't make them. The message here is simple: you're born, you die and hopefully sometime in between you make yourself and others happy. This is a wonderful film.",1252022400,,1122,4.42512077294686
3259842,4,B000YAF4MA,"My 12 year old son and I watched it together and we both, surprisingly, enjoyed it very much!  The first 30 minutes was a bit slow but still held our interest.  The journey that these two new friends took was enjoyable to watch unfold. For me at least, a ""bucket list"" is about self discovery and doing things that one might not think they could or would do.  True, the movie was sad in a way because it dealt with cancer and death.  But more so it was about thinking outside the box and overcoming that comfort zone that we sometimes put ourselves into.  In the end, both men ""lived"" life and were happily united with their families before their demise.

I would rather be ashes than dust!
I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.
The function of man is to live, not to exist.
I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them.
I shall use my time.

While it of course is slightly predictable I do not feel it takes anything away from the movie. It managed to bring a very difficult phase in the two main characters and their families lives to the silverscreen in a very positive manner - and shed a positive spin on the inevitability of growing old and eventually dying. Much like Tuesdays with Morris did both in the book and movie.

A must see - for older people to lift their spirits and incite them to be active and enjoy themselves to the end - and for younger people to remind them to enjoy life and spread happiness to others while they still can.",1243641600,,825,4.15625

The plot proceeded as expected, and Nicholson has seemingly played a variant of fly-be-free unseemly older man goes off-the-rails in at least two other films.  He does it well, of course, but the role is no test of his skill.  Freeman's character experiences and expresses a wider range of feeling and transition, and it is he the audience comes to identify with most.

Carter is a scholarly mechanic with a large loving family & wife of 45 years. The movie may skew a bit to the older crowd but anybody can appreciate this movie. Besides, what over-50 guy has not composed a bucket list of sorts, things to do, places to see before death? Both men are given death sentences, months to live. They compose a list. Being asymphtomatic & having all of Ed's money to play with they begin, much to Carter's wife, Virginia's consernation. Beverly Todd cannot be 65 years old. A good looking woman. She wants Carter to die quietly in her arms. They do the things, racing a Cobra Shelby on a course, jumping out of a plane, visiting the pryamids etc. as they fly around the world (Ed has a private jet). It becomes a buddy/road trip. There are challenges that each has problems with such as Carter being faithful to his wife & Ed reconciling with his grown daughter. It is all done with humor & heavy doses of pop-philsophy. I can see director Rob Reiner fingerprints all over the place. It is all pretty entertaining. The ending of the movie is of course pre-ordained. Even that is amusing.

There wasn't anything new here that I haven't already seen in other films. The movie was not even entertaining, it was laborious and self important.",1237680000,3,525,4.655913978494624

3259866,4,B000YAF4MA,"Starting out in a hospital, The Bucket List has a sad beginning where two terminally ill men encounter each other. With just months to live, the two men (Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman) see the world together. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson soon begin to make a list of all the things they want to do before they ""kick the bucket"".
Soon after escaping from the cancer ward, the two men set out on their long journey to fulfill the bucket list. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman take a private jet to Egypt. While sitting on an Egyptian pyramid, Morgan Freeman tells Jack Nicholson, ""You know, the ancient Egyptians had a beautiful belief on death. When their souls got to the entrance to heaven, the guards asked two questions. Their answers determined whether they were able to enter or not. Have you found joy in your life? Has your life brought joy to others?"" Throughout the movie, the mood changes constantly. Changing from one sad, touching scene to the next gut-busting scene, The Bucket List is a movie you can not easily walk away from.
 The scenery in The Bucket List was extraordinary. The Bucket List had many changing scenes, and each scene looked just as real as the one before it. When Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are skydiving, the scenery around them looks like they are actually sky diving. Before jumping out of the plane, they do a shot of the ground below them, and it looks like they are actually about to jump out of the plane. Flying through the air in the airplane on their way to another location, Morgan Freeman looked out his plane window and saw all the purple and white clouds. They did an excellent job of making it look like they were actually on an airplane. They also did an excellent job in scenery when Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are sitting on top of a pyramid in Egypt. When they are sitting on the pyramid and looking out into the Egyptian world, it looks like every detail was real, and they were actually there.
The topic of The Bucket List is supposed to be a sad topic, but the way they describe it in the movie makes it a lot less sad. The Bucket List has two men that have brain cancer and are going to die in a couple months. Any person would think that making a movie that has to do with cancer would be sad, but The Bucket List  has the two men meet each other in the hospital and enjoy their last few months together. The way the director approaches the situation makes the movie funny and enjoyable.  I was very impressed by how good of a job the director did of making the movie funny and not sad. The movie has two total strangers spend the last few months of their lives together and become best friends, and it even helped Jack Nicholson ""bring joy to others"".
 The Bucket List was nominated for Best Picture, a Grammy and a Golden Reel Award. After watching The Bucket List, I now see why it was nominated for those awards. The Bucket List has been the best movie I've seen so far. The Bucket List had many memorable quotes, but the quote that caught my attention the most was, ""I know when he died, his eyes were closed and his heart was open"" stated by Morgan Freeman after Jack Nicholson died. I would highly recommend this movie to people. This movie has changed my perspective on living life to the fullest. Even though you may be dying, that shouldn't stop you from having fun and achieving your goals. After seeing The Bucket List, I understand what living life to the fullest means. Jack Nicholson (Edward) and Morgan Freeman (Carter) truly did live their lives to the fullest, especially their last few months of life.

3259882,4,B000YAF4MA,"The movie ""The Bucket List"" depicts the relationship between two men dying of cancer and how their unlikely pairing helps fulfill the unmet needs of the other.  The two men are admitted to the same hospital room.  The corporate millionaire and the scholarly mechanic initially are not at all interested in one another.  Their friendship begins after each receives their diagnosis and therefore has something in common.

The scholarly mechanic begins a ""bucket to do list"" only to crumple it and throw it on the floor.  The corporate millionaire finds it on the floor picks it up and reads it.  He interrogates the scholarly mechanic and proceeds to add to the list.  Soon both men are working together to complete the ""bucket to do list"" before they kick the bucket.  The list varies from ""sky-diving"" to ""kissing the most beautiful woman in the world.""

The Warner Brother Pictures movie features the always irreverent Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole, the corporate millionaire and the perpetually levelheaded Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers, the scholarly mechanic.  Rob Reiner directed the film.

I enjoyed Jack Nicholson's wildness and Morgan Freeman's love of family and learning.  Each has a missing piece in their life the other is destined to fill.  They travel and do what many of us dream of doing.  The most important ""to do"" item in the end is love of family.

You will not want or be able to move for sometime after the movie ends.  Your head will be spinning with thoughts about your own life's ""bucket to do list.""  When your head stops spinning, go the movie's website where you can complete a Facebook Application and create your own list.

One thing you can pretty much count on from the very beginning is to be crying by the time the film reaches its conclusion.  You pretty much KNOW you'll be crying by the end, and that the happiness between the two characters isn't going to stay like that forever.

This unlikely pair become great friends throughout the movie.  They begin developing a 'bucket list' - items that they have always wanted to do before their deaths.  The roster of 'to do' items includes such things as skydiving, driving race cars, visiting the Great Wall of China, laughing until you cry, and viewing something truly majestic.

Due to Cole's unlimited financial resources, they are able to fund their dreams.  They also come to realize what things are really important.

3259888,5,B000YAF4MA,"What the devil was I thinking?  When Rob Reiner's THE BUCKET LIST first appeared in theaters, I passed.  I saw the trailers--two old coots kicking up their heels before cashing in their chips--and thought the film looked too contrived and superficial.  Well, I caught the ending of the movie on cable recently, then couldn't wait to view it again, which I did (several times).  This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen, and I've seen some intense movers and shakers.

It's a given when a film features talent like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman you are going to get excellent performances.  And both actors deliver:  Freeman as a lifelong mechanic whose true ambitions were thwarted by circumstances; the irascible Nicholson as a curmudgeonly tycoon.  Both characters are suddenly thrown together by terminal illnesses, yet through all the turmoil and heartache a fast friendship develops.  The friction between them as they first meet, the adventures they share as they go through their respective ""Bucket Lists"", make up the movie's most comedic scenes.  The skydiving scene, in particular, was very effective for me, as it was readily apparent both Freeman and Nicholson were actually freefalling through the air during the scene.

The actors themselves could have kicked the bucket.

Yet the ending was what moved me the most.  Because we as the audience have developed an attachment to the characters, it becomes very difficult to watch as they meet their respective fates.  The interaction between the two in the end--the total and complete way each man has made a change, for the better, in his friend's life--makes for one incredibly poignant climax.  THE BUCKET LIST covers the full range of emotions; easily one of the best bittersweet movies in many years.  Highly recommended.

Still, as a film it's not very memorable.  I saw it a week ago and I'm just remembering that I watched it and needed to post a review.  Nicholson is Nicholson and of course Morgan Freeman is narrating. (If it ain't broke then don't fix it, eh?) Overall, it's just okay.",1230422400,,436,4.204819277108434
3259890,5,B000YAF4MA,"Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson, need I say more? In the beginning we're introduced the sweet voice of Morgan Freeman narrating while shots of the Himalayas flash on screen. We see a lonely climber who will also be at the end of the film.

  Freeman is absolutely outstanding as Carter Chambers. Carter is a mechanic who for 45 years has greased up his arms working to give his children and wife. Nicholson is a rich tyrant named Edward Cole who's only joy in life it seems is to make money and cause hell to the people around him. Yet, they meet up in Cole's hospital, both being treated for cancer. One night Carter creates a ""Bucket List"", yet throws it on the floor. Cole picks up and Carter tells him the story of how his Freshman Philosophy teacher asked them to make a ""Bucket List""; Things they wanted to do before they died. Ironic how it comes into play now? So funded by Cole's millions and both of their desires to do more before their deaths, they go on the adventure. Skydiving, racing sports cars, going to France, and going on an African safari are among some of the things they do. And to keep from potential spoilers, I'll stop here.
  Overall ""The Bucket List"" isn't a movie in the traditional sense, you take a lot more away from it than your average run of the mill comedy/drama. It's tearful (dealing with death is never easy), it's inspiring, and perhaps at times a little tacky.

3259892,5,B000YAF4MA,"We probably all theoretically have that list of things that we all hope to accomplish before we meet our fateful end here on Earth. Whether the list include tangible sort of goals like run a marathon or climb a mountain or somewhat more intangible things like being a better person or contributing to society, the reason as to why we might choose to list such items is to sort of set some goals in the life that passes us by so quickly.

Often times we might not take seriously the list of things to achieve until it is too late. We might be caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life that removes our focus from what might be a priority and what might not be. There are times when we might fail to start addressing the things that might be classified as goals until ""everything else"" is done.

Directed by Rob Reiner, The Bucket List is a humorous yet somewhat philosophical film that maybe even for just a few seconds reminds us that maybe there is more to life than just the rigmarole of our professional lives. In a society that is driven by numbers, results and expectations, a failure to step back every now and again could indeed push each of us to our passing in a more expeditious manner.

The Bucket List gets its name because it is one man's listing of things that he hopes to accomplish before he kicks the bucket.

Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a mechanic by trade but perhaps a professor by knowledge and action. Carter seems to know just about every fact there is to know about just about everything. A Jeopardy wizard, Carter is satisfied with his life as a mechanic but cannot help but wonder if decisions that he made perhaps could have forever changed the life that he lives.

One day while working in his shop, Carter comes out to find that he has terminal cancer and likely does not have much time left to live. Though he has sort of found his peace with the diagnosis, Carter does try some experimental cancer treatment in an attempt to give not just himself but his family some more time.

By matter of circumstance, Carter ends up becoming hospital roommate with Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) who is, interestingly enough, the owner of the hospital where the two are staying. Edward has made his fortune in the health care industry owning and operating hospitals. His business approach to health care has always been more about the dollars and cents more than it has been about providing quality health care.

But when Edward comes to find out that he too is on a quick path to death due to a cancer diagnosis, as well, Edward finds a new perspective on life. His friendship with Carter is a unique and interesting one that at times is about nothing more than playing gin while at other times it is all about personal and emotional issues the two might be sharing.

Sean Hayes plays the role of Thomas, who is Edward's right hand man and does it remarkably well. There is the right level of cynicism directed back at the boss that truly makes the dynamic between the two shine.
Needless to say, the two friends each start to look at the things that are on their joint bucket list and wonder whether or not they will be able to accomplish many of them before they pass. As the absurdity of some of the tasks grows so does their friendship that really was like a phoenix that rose from the ashes of being nothing more than hospital roommates.

What makes The Bucket List such an enjoyable film is really the message that it gets across. Though certainly it is meant to be watched partially as a comedy, there is also the right amount of a sort of deeper meaning to the film that makes it a complete film. Freeman and Nicholson are the ideal actors for the parts that they were cast for and it is clear to see why they were chosen.

The Bucket List is an amazingly well done film that is certainly worth while to add to your own bucket list of movies to watch. After all, it could help to shed some perspective as to your own daily living.",1229472000,,3974,4.431506849315069
3259893,5,B000YAF4MA,"This is by far the best movie of the year. Heartwarming, funny and serious all at the same time. The interaction between Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson is as classic as Paul Newman and Robert Redford. This is a must see.",1229040000,,223,4.463414634146342
3259894,1,B000YAF4MA,"The new Jack Nicholson & Morgan Freeman buddy picture is downright depressing. Indeed, the Warner Brothers' trailer for ""The Bucket List"" made it look like a hilarious combination of ""Grumpy Old Men"" meet ""Odd Couple"" in a cancer ward. The Oscar-winning actors play an Abbott & Costello pair of charismatic cut-ups with cancer. Unfortunately, this warm fuzzy frolic about two terminally-ill old-times that tear off for one final fling is predictable, preposterous, and ultimately pathetic. This is the kind of movie that would make a hospice nurse snicker out of one corner of his or her mouth. No disrespect intended to hospice nurses.

Our elderly heroes loiter for the first thirty minutes in a hospital, the next thirty on a round-the-world, fun-in-the-sun, travelogue thrill ride, and the last thirty minutes taking forever to die. Ironically, billionaire hospital magnate Edward Cork (paunchy Jack Nicholson of ""Anger Management"") has never been sick a day in his life. He parlayed his fortune out of privatizing health care facilities. Two beds for each room, he stipulates early in the opening scene, he doesn't operate health spas. No sooner has Cork declared this dictum than he lands in one of his own hospitals with six months to live. When he awakens, Cork demands a private room. Not possible, his right-hand man Thomas (Sean Hayes of TV's ""Will & Grace"") admonishes him. Cork's choice of a private room, Thomas points out, would undermine Cork's own dictum about low-cost hospital facilities. Thankfully, Jack Nicholson doesn't moon us like Tom Hanks did in ""Charlie Wilson's War."" Of course, what movie about chemo patients would be complete without the star in his hospital gown puking in a toilet?

Auto mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman of ""Unforgiven"") suspects that he has his own tumor when he discards his last cigarette. Unlike the quadruple divorced Cork, Chambers has been happily married to his high school sweetheart for 45 years with two financially successful grown-up sons and a daughter. The boys have made him a grandfather while his daughter has become a world-class violinist.

Cork and Carter wind up in the same room but they aren't made for each other. One day, Carter scribbles out an inventory of activities on a yellow pad he'd like to do before he kicks the bucket. Generously, Cork offers to foot the bill for their adrenalin-laced adventures. Our heroes behave like overgrown adolescents. They parachute from planes, careen around in race cars, climb the Great Pyramids, and motorcycle the length of the Great Wall of China. Lastly, they share the laugh of their lives when they discover Cork's premium coffee derives its unique flavor from the digestive tract of an exotic tree cat that feeds on them.

Nicholson and Freeman together aren't enough to redeem freshman writer Justin Zackman's contrived clowning about friendship, death, and dying. We're none the wiser for watching this platitudinous pabulum. ""The Bucket List"" qualifies as another loser from director Rob Reiner who once made good movies such as ""When Harry Meet Sally,"" ""The Sure Thing,"" ""Stand By Me,"" and ""The Princess Bride."" Lately, he has been dishing up dreck like ""North,"" ""The Ghosts of Mississippi,"" ""The Story of Us,"" ""Alex and Emma,"" and ""Rumor Has It.""

The tear-jerking titans that Nicholson and Freeman play possess far too much stamina and energy as former chemotherapy patients to perform their daring feats. The skydiving scenes are the genuine item,with Nicholson and Freeman clearly in the air above th earth, but the racing scenes suffer from obvious back-projection footage. What? They could sky dive from several thousand feet for real, but they cannot drive like hellions for a quarter of a mile?

Make ""The Bucket List"" the last movie you ever see!",1228608000,12,3791,5.12621359223301

This is an enjoyable movie with a more than capable cast especially in the two leads. I can watch these guys in just about anything, and Freeman could recite the phone book and I would listen.

The movie is kept on a comedic level through most of the story, probably because we would be crying all the way through this film if it weren't! Believe me you will shed a tear before it ends, but through the middle of the film, I found a lot of the ""Bucket List"" ""high jinks"" to be rather artificial at times.

3259899,3,B000YAF4MA,"As a long-time fan of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, I expected to see some strong performances from these two great actors.  Although they didn't live up to some of their earlier great roles, neither were they disappointing.  Both did yeoman's work in their roles as aging men from very different life backgrounds, one phenomenally rich and the other a humble laborer, who found common ground in their battle with terminal cancer.  Both are forced, without regard to wealth or social status, to come to grips with both their own mortality and their past failings.

The first half hour or so of the movie was less than gripping, and at times maybe even a little tedious, but once it moves into the meat of the storyline it takes on a new life (although even at this it seems a bit too contrived and just missed a fourth star).  In their quest to live full lives in their last remaining months, and thus to try to undo a lifetime of squandered opportunities, they stumble upon something far more valuable -- true self-understanding, true friendship, and, most importantly, redemption.

I hate spoilers, so I won't give any clues except to say that the end of this frequently humorous, frequently poignant tale is delightfully unexpected and equally poetic.  This is not a great movie, but I would characterize it as a good one that will, or at least should, prompt each viewer to stop and think about his or her own approach to life, and to pursue the most important things while there's still time.",1226275200,,1502,4.709923664122138

3259908,5,B000YAF4MA,"I will admit, I did hesitate to watch this movie given all the hype and publicity. I finally broke down and rented it and I'm so glad I did.
I've read some other reviews and agree with some of them.
But, what I got out of this movie goes a lot deeper.
This movie speaks to me of the ties in human nature. The ties to family, to our work, our identity, our ideals, our religion and even to strangers. There are countless ties that bind us each and every moment of every day. How tight the tie is depends on the moment, the situation, other who are present.
In this movie, the main characters loosen their ties and focus on themselves. They set out to accomplish things they wish they had done in their life....before their death.
This movie also shows how reaching a dream isn't done alone. Whether we think about it or not, we do not live alone in this world. However, how much consideration do we often have toward each other? Even those who are 'invisible' to us most of the time?
I can't begin to tell you how deep you can go with the thoughts provoked in this movie. But I will tell you this. If you see only one movie to shake the cobwebs out of your brain and make you aware of 'Life'... this should be it.
Cudos to Rob Reiner and all that went into this movie. Definiely a classic.",1222300800,,1288,4.19758064516129
3259909,4,B000YAF4MA,"MY name is Lim, Dr. Michael Lim and I am The Travelling Gourmet. I saw this movie sitting in Business Class on an Emirates flight to DUBAI. The flight was smooth, the food was fabulous, the flight stewardesses were courteous and good looking. However, the icing on the cake that made the flight perfect was this movie. It is a movie about death, for we all die once we are born. I calculated once how many minutes a person has if he or she lives for 100 years. It is not a lot if you make the calculation yourself.
The story is simple. Morgan Freeman has a list of what you want to do before 'you kick the bucket', hence the title: The Bucket List. Jack Nicholson, one of my favourite actors, just like Emirates is one of may favourite airlines, is superb in his wise cracking role of a man who has just months to live. He has the money to make Morgan Freeman's hypothetical 'bucket list' a reality. He says at one point, 'Money, that's all I got'
So the two buddies go and do all the things they wanted to do but never did and for them as for all of us, time really is running out.
I used to parachute and the parachuting scene is hilarious and it really looks like Jack did the tandem jump, unless CGI is so good nowadays that it can fool me. The movie insurance premium on Jack must have been huge.
They race fast cars like pro drivers and Jack even tries to set up Morgan with a beautiful, intelligent fille de joie, but Morgan, good guy that he is, politely declines. That shows there are those who still keep to their principles, no matter what. Something I always admire in a person.
Morgan's wife is enraged that he is spending his last hours with a new found friend instead of with his family.
Jack's performance is outstanding as it was to in 'Something's gotta give'. He is physically ugly but boy, he sure can act! And his charisma and screen presence c'est formidable!!!
See this movie and laugh and maybe, just maybe, make your own bucket list to do. Time and tide wait for no man.

3259910,4,B000YAF4MA,"This is one of those movies that the public enjoys much more than the professional movie watching people. Roger Ebert, for example, delivers a heated diatribe on the liberties taken in Bucket List, particularly with respect to the realities of having cancer, a subject the esteemed critic has experienced first-hand. Ebert's anger, however, seems more connected with his own personal trauma than he acknowledges. I, for one, don't hold movies up to that kind of litmus test. It's more about how much the film gets inside you, makes you feel, engages you and keeps you watching for more as the story unfolds. Reiner's film does all those things here, at least for me. While it is admittedly formulaic to pit the wise, quiet, gentle and all-giving soul (Freeman) against the narcissistic, shallow, in-your-face, yet ultimately loveable character which Nicholson can pretty much phone in by this time, at the end of the day, IT WORKS. Good drama often involves the tempering of opposites and The Bucket List is no expection. We watch with satisfaction as these two extremely different men move toward their expected and imminent deaths, willing to break out of their lives as they've lived them so far, each allowing change to occur through the influence of the other. Much of it is just fun, Hollywoodish entertainment, but there is depth there as well. When I got up from watching this movie, I was aware of it having gotten inside me; I felt an openness and gratitude for my own life and those in it. And whereas I certainly can't credit The Bucket List for the having the ability to evoke that response in everyone who watches it, I do recommend it as entertainment, a few laughs and the occasional kleenex.

Suggestion: buy the DVD, find an appropriate film clip, and energize a future staff meeting at work with some bucket list questions for your organization.  Example:
1) In groups of three, after you've shared one item from your personal bucket list, suggest two or three bucket list goals for our organization. 2) Some call it a BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) but let's call it the Numero Uno Bucket List Goal today.  If we knew that our company or organization was going out of business (kicking the bucket) in the next three years, what is the most important goal we would want to achieve by the end of 2011?

3259926,4,B000YAF4MA,"It's really virtually impossible not to like a movie with Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson in it.. they add a sense of gravitas to anything they are in - and there is pleasure to be had in watching their contrasting styles spark off each other.
Here, the play two men, both suffering from cancer, sharing a room at a hospital (in a rather contrived set up).  After some preamble to fleetingly show that they are actually not well, they create a bucket list - a list of things they want to do before kicking the bucket, and since one of them is rich, set out to work their way through the items, learning about themselves and each other as they go.
It works because the leads are strong, particularly Freeman.  Nicholson overplays, but then the writing does call for it.  It does stumble however in the script department from time to time... For example, Freeman talking to Nicholson - ""You once said you're not everyone. Well, that's true-you're certainly not everyone, but everyone is everyone.""  It's not exactly Shakespeare.  The concept of terminally ill men skydiving, climbing mountains and traveling the world somewhat while barely catching their breath also stretches credibility.  Morgan Freeman does his trademark stately voice over, which only serves to remind you of The Shawshank Redemption, and the comparison is not favourable.  And while the male bonding is fun to watch and some of the one-liners funny, the warmth of affection Freeman narrates for the Nicholson character never seems quite justified by anything his character does.
Those quibbles aside, it's fun, warm and fuzzy round the edges, has some decent performances, and is short enough not to outlast its welcome.  Not a classic, but thumbs up nonetheless.",1218672000,,1735,4.958620689655173

3259928,4,B000YAF4MA,"This is truly one of those Sunday afternoon feel good kind of movies. Two terminal cancer patients find themselves thrown together by a hospital policy of two beds to every room, no matter what. Oddly enough Edward Cole is the business tycoon who for years preached the ""We run hospitals not day spas"" policy that is until he was the patient at his very on hospital. Then he demanded a private room, to which his assistant Tommy (who real name is Matthew lol) told him would be a PR nightmare so he has to settle with being roomies with Carter. Carter is an all around family man/mechanic, whom gave up on his dream of being a history teacher to make sure his children never wanted for anything. During the year he attended college his professor had them create a ""bucket list"" which essential is a list of things that you want to do before you kick the bucket aka die. Once Carter was given his test results he throws his list which Edward finds, thus leads to the adventures of Edward and Carter, setting out to complete their bucket list. This isn't some thought provoking heart tugging film, but as previously stated it's a feel good movie, that shows that someone rich ole fogy can help a complete stranger for the good.",1218499200,,1225,4.5225225225225225
3259929,4,B000YAF4MA,"Let me ask you a question, if you could know the date or at least the approximate time frame of when you were going to die, would you want to? If you did choose to find out, would you live out the remainder of your days in fear of that final moment, or regretting things you may or may not have had the chance to do? On the other hand, would you take whatever time you were allotted to do your best to live your life to its fullest potential? That is a question, and is essentially the basic theme, that is presented in the new comedy/drama ""The Bucket List"" starring Morgan Freeman (""The Dark Knight"") and Jack Nicholson (""The Departed"").

""The Bucket List"" is the story of two complete strangers, one is a cantankerous billionaire named Edward (Jack Nicholson), and the other is a very kind and wise mechanic named Carter (Morgan Freeman), who find themselves in the same depressing situation when they discover they both have the same prognosis... cancer. Rather than letting this sort of news send them headlong into the depths of depression, these two men embark on an inspiring journey to see and experience many of the world's greatest sights and adventures; showing to everyone around them that just because your time is short, that does not mean your life is over already.

Director Rob Reiner (""A Few Good Men""), along with writer Justin Zackham, have done a very good job of balancing an incredibly serious subject matter that hits close to home for many viewers, while at the same time injecting the story with a hefty dose of humor to lift the mood of the film. For some, mixing such a serious subject with comedy may seem offensive or disrespectful, but the story never becomes so humorous that the primary subject ever becomes watered down or treated lightly. I also like that along with the very well-written story, the movie poses some thought-provoking questions that will cause you to think about whether you would like to know when or how you will die, and what exactly you would do with that knowledge. It is always nice when a movie is willing to become a little more than just entertainment and good storytelling, allowing itself to create some form of discussion over its subject matter or themes.

Regarding the stars of the film, it's not surprising that the two lead actors do a terrific job, after all both are veterans of the film business, and their performances have never once disappointed me in any film. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were the absolute perfect choices to play these two characters; and through their growing friendship, respect for each other, and the realistic problems and challenges they must face, along with the cleverly written dialogue, we are effectively drawn into their lives, easily relating to and becoming emotionally invested in them. Actor Sean Hayes, best known for TV's ""Will and Grace"", is the witness to the inspiring adventure these newfound friends embark upon, and his own sarcasm fits in perfectly with Edward's sardonic nature and Carter's keen intellect and quick wit. Every member of the cast did an excellent job of gracefully moving back and forth between the serious nature of the disease plaguing the two leads' lives and the humorous moments spread throughout the film, never once failing to appropriately portray either side of the situation.

""The Bucket List"" is the perfect example of what has been dubbed a dramedy by many people; it's a mixture of a drama and comedy, never becoming solely one or the other. The cast is perfect, giving the characters a depth and realism that is needed for a film such as this; the script is well-written and crafted to perfectly balance the gravity of the situation with some light-hearted humor. Overall, this is just a really good movie that will undoubtedly hit closer to home for some more than others, but it still should be seen, as it is an inspiring example of not letting your life's circumstances, grave or otherwise, get the best of you.

""The Bucket List"" is rated PG-13 for language and sexuality and violence.",1218240000,,4048,4.785407725321888

3259932,5,B000YAF4MA,"Finally, a warm and wholesome movie you can watch with your family.  The Bucket List brings together two noble actors, and their opposite life experiences juxtaposed on their common destiny (a diagnosis of cancer with 6 months to live).  Ed Cole, mega-rich egotistical and lonely executive and Carter Chambers, a gifted but humble blue-collar family man with faith meet in a common hospital room and bond while recovering from surgeries and going through chemotherapy.  When they both learn of their common fate, they decide to do everything they always wanted to do before it is too late.  What starts off as a rip-roaring adventure with comic moments ends when each man ""crosses the line"" by setting up a situation that the other one is uncomfortable with.  However at the same time, both men are healed from the emotional problems that they had in their personal lives, having taught each other a lesson that there are people and relationships more important than just adventure, experiences and fun.  Finally Cole cared about someone other than himself, and Carter gets to laugh so hard until he cries.  Even though the ending is sad, because of the cancer, the story is uplifting, as both men transcend their previous existence, in the final moments of life, in having helped a perfect stranger (each other):  Carter loses his bitterness and Cole his self-centeredness.",1217894400,,1374,5.022026431718062

The movie is funny, introspective (especially if you're in that 45-60 age group), and enlightening (especially if you're in that 20-35 age group).

45-60 - Do you have a bucket list? Get to work on it. Now!

20-35 - Don't put off the things you want to do; as Nike said, ""Just Do It!""",1217635200,,630,4.147540983606557
3259938,5,B000YAF4MA,"This movie is a must-see, especially for those age 50 and above.  Nicholson and Freeman play well off of each other, playing two of the most unlikely individuals to ever meet, let alone share an endearing experience together.  The book of Proverbs teaches us in verse 17 of chapter 27, ""As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.""  This could not be more true of what transpires between these two men as they face their mortality together.  Each learns from the other and is the better for it.  I don't think I ever laughed and cried so much while watching the same movie.",1217548800,,583,4.514285714285714

I passed it on to my mom and she enjoyed it as well as it  as she could relate to many of the scenes and feelings.  Not a tear jerker. Lots of smiles instead. These 2 guys are the greatest and paired together, they made the movie.  Bravo",1217462400,,444,4.116279069767442
3259940,5,B000YAF4MA,"Great 'must see' movie!  Before watching this with me, my 13-year-old son said ""But this is an old people's movie""; his mind quickly changed when this DVD filled our TV screen.  Edward (Nicholson) and Carter (Freeman) are cancer patients sharing a hospital room when they both get the news that they each have only six months to a year to live.  Although the movie shows how these men choose to cope with death, the theme is definitely living life to the fullest and finding joy along the way.

The two write a 'Bucket List' of things they want to do before they kick the bucket.  It includes things like getting a tattoo and kissing the most beautiful girl in the world.  Both actor shine in this movie, so much so that I'd place a hefty cash bet on this winning some serious awards.

By the way, my son liked this movie as much as I did and has learned not to judge the content of a movie by the age of the actors appearing in it!  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with eyes in their head.",1217462400,,1002,4.264550264550264

Nicholson is fantastic in this, he is much like his character in Term of Enderment, he is at times funny and at time heart breaking.  Freeman gets the less showing part, but as always he is solid and thoroughly likeable.  Sean Hayes does a predictable turn as Nicholsons assistant, but he is good none the less.  I read reviews of this film when it came out and most were less than glowing, so I was reluctant to get the DVD..that was a mistake, not only did I enjoy this movie to the utmost, but I plan to watch it several more times..if for no other reason than to watch the amazing cinemaphotography that opens the film and to listen to John Mayers perfect ""Say"", that ends the film.",1217203200,,845,4.391025641025641

3259945,3,B000YAF4MA,"The movie is entertaining, funny and poignant at the end.  We all have a list of things we want to do or accomplish in life, but haven't.  The ""Bucket List"" gives us a chance to see and live our dreams through the two elderly men,  Carter Chamberlain (Morgan Freeman) a happily married auto mechanic, and Edward Cole (a billionaire playboy).  Both happen to share a hospital room and both have terminal cancer with just months to live.

When Edward Cole (who has billions and wants to spend it) was trying to convince Carter Chamberlain to take the time they had in remission to do things on the bucket list, he compared how fast the last 45 years of his life had went and how fast the coming months would go by.  Edward asked Carter if he rather go home to his family and have them adjust their lives and routines around his disease or celebrate what time was left?

If you can take the leap of faith that terminal patients can run off for months without a care and enjoy every minute they have left - you get the message of the film and enjoy the life, love, laughter.",1217030400,,1070,4.346733668341709

Other parts dragged on, but it wasn't boring.  Interesting movie, and two excellent actors.  Made me think about my life, mostly, and what I'm doing wrong, or could change.  I suppose that was the whole purpose of the movie, maybe?

Anyway, I enjoyed it, definitely worth renting.  Great performances, could have had a deeper plot though.

And I have to mention, the video quality was excellent, didn't notice any hiccups in the playing of the movie.  Amazon has done a great job.  And I didn't have to spend any money on gas to rent this movie (a definite plus!).",1216771200,,712,4.519685039370079
3259950,3,B000YAF4MA,"This is a generic buddy movie but unlike Curtis and Poitier in The Defiant Ones, Nicholson and Freeman are chained together metaphorically: both have only a short time to live and both are seeking some kind of meaning before their hearts cease beating.  The conceit is simple, the script is undemanding and the plot line unfolds pretty much exactly as you'd expect, with chippy dialog and set-piece dramatic moments, not to mention the inevitable ""meaning of life"" schticks that recur with monotonous regularity.

What makes it worth watching (aside from the gorgeous travelog visuals) is that Nicholson truly acts for a moment, near the very end, during the funeral oration.  He's a star who has spent so much of his career mugging to camera that it's a real joy to see him doing more, and actually doing it successfully.

Furthermore there's a scene that is unintentionally comic: about one-third into the movie when the two protagonists are in their shared hospital room deep in a discussion about life, the continuity goes to hell as Freeman's spectacles alternately appear and disappear from his face as shot follows shot.  Clearly the director hoped no one would notice and forewent the expense of re-shooting the scene.  This unintended comic effect has the additional virtue of distracting from the leaden dialog, so it's wholly a plus point.

All in all, this is just another Hollywood mechanically-cranked-out product but it's pleasantly distracting and essentially harmless and (mirabilis dictu) there isn't a firearm in sight.",1216684800,,1538,5.152610441767068

3259954,4,B000YAF4MA,"Although older people or those that have known someone with a terminal illness may have more appreciation for this movie, most people should enjoy it. Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole, and Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers give great performances as men who are already past midlife and appreciating their waning years. Edward as a captain of industry, and Carter as a father and trivia buff. When they both find themselves next to each other in the hospital with cancer and a few months to live, both their lives change. The greatest change is for Edward. The movie is not to preachy but it shows us some of realism of being terminally ill with cancer. We see the impact it has on each man in his own way.

For the fun of it Carter had started to create a ""Bucket List"" based on a class he had taken discussing what they wanted to do before they die. Carter throws it away when he learns of his final fast approaching fate. Edward finds it and decides it's the best course of action for them to have one last fling of life before they die. The rest the movie we see them travelling around the world, racing cars, and skydiving. The conclusion of the movie we see they go their separate ways with different priorities but then meeting again in a dramatic way when one is near death. The message given is a good one for anyone that has a family or friends they have alienated. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.

3259963,3,B000YAF4MA,"Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman deliver excellent performances in a difficult movie. The two men, Edward Cole (Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Freeman), polar opposites of each other, find themselves dying in the same hospital room. Given six months or so to live, the two set out to do... something. They never really saw the idea the same way, or articulated its meaning. There were some touching moments, some great exchanges, but the film felt mediocre.

Somehow, every movie that attempts to lecture on the richness of life or the lessons of the dying winds up being stale. They can make for decent books (see Tuesdays with Morrie), but most movies never shake that moralist tone and lack of plot. At least Tuesdays with Morrie had viable points and lessons to teach; the closest the Bucket List came was Nicholson's character's advice on old age: ""Never pass up a bathroom, never waste a hard-on, and never trust a fart."" And that's pretty much the tone that Edward Cole held throughout the movie. Obnoxious. That was one of the major let-downs; the movie was supposed to be about his redemption, but we only barely tasted it.

As far as acting went, I thought Freeman was excellent as usual, especially in his narration, but perhaps too attached to his usual gentle/sombre/dignified old man persona. 4.5 stars for him. Nicholson's performance seemed to me to be average, not worthy of the great reputation he's built. His patterns of inflection never changed; 2.5 stars there, although understand his character wasn't likable at all.

The side character Thomas, Cole's assistant, was a foil to his boss in two ways: first, his delivery was twice as good as Nicholson's, and second, he was twice as likable. Kudos.

All in all, mediocrity barely lifted by star power. The plot seemed forced, the characters unsatisfying, and the idea wasted. All hail Morgan Freeman, but... this film is barely even worth renting. 2.75 stars",1216080000,,1932,4.953703703703703

Even if you hated one (or even all) of these, there's still a good chance you'll love Bucket List.  This movie is full of beautiful scenery, hilarity, and true friendship - complete with very real life-questions, and great honesty.  While the situation is not a common one, the characters, their problems, hurts, and joys ring very true.

The old ""You'll laugh.  You'll cry."" fits well, in this case, but you're pretty sure to laugh a lot more than you cry.  You'll also find yourself recalling, and probably quoting lines from it for months to come.

3259997,4,B000YAF4MA,"Based on previews and coming attractions, ""The Bucket List"" was a movie that held no interest for me.  Sure, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are good actors.  Sure, Rob Reiner has directed at least a dozen other movies that I've liked a lot.  But the premise of ""The Bucket List""  sounded weird and unappealing.  This movie is proof that an excellent cast and a skillful director can turn straw into, if not exactly gold, maybe stainless steel.  The movie certainly exceeded my expectations.

Two men with nothing in common except cancer and chemotherapy meet while sharing a hospital room.  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a family man who has been married for 45 years.  He has a loving family, an insatiable intellect and the soul of a philosopher.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) has been divorced four times, is estranged from his only child, has no friends and is accompanied everywhere by a paid personal assistant.  His lifelong talent and passion has been for business and making money; he's a billionaire.

As an academic exercise Carter starts a list of things he'd like to do before he dies.  Edward, picks up the discarded list and is immediately intrigued.  So, with unlimited funding from Jack, the two set off to do all the things they wanted to do... intended to do.... someday.... before 45 years blew past ""like smoke through a keyhole.""

Sean Hayes is terrific as Edward's assistant, Thomas.  I always found him annoyingly over-the-top on ""Will and Grace.""  Here he proves that he can be more charming and much more funny when he dials it down a few notches.

The DVD special features are limited; a brief featurette - ""Writing a Bucket List"" and a John Mayer Music Video 'Say'.  You can insert the DVD into your PC's disk drive more additional special features - something that always seems more trouble than it's worth.  There is no commentary track.

""The Bucket List"" isn't a raucous comedy.  The premise sounds grim but there is humor throughout the film - low key, subtle and thoughtful.  I give it 3 1/2 stars for being better than it had any right to be considering the material.",1214697600,2,2111,4.7707182320441985

Jack is a man without faith whereas Morgan's life is centered on his faith.  They meet in a hospital room where they find out that their days are numbered.

Ikiru is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, never fails to bring tears to my eyes and there are a few quite sarcastic moments and ironic humor in the film, as well. What is more remarkable is ""Ikiru"" was released in 1952 and there is not one truth that was expressed 56 years ago that seems at all archaic or inaccurate in, or irrelevant to, our world today.

No, ""Ikuri"" has not got the Hollywood look and feel and yes, you are either required to read, or are better off reading, the subtitles (very well done in the Criterion Collection edition). But seeing it once, you will remember it for a very long time and feel compelled to revisit it again, at times when life seems to lose its shine and inspiration.

3260002,3,B000YAF4MA,"I approached this movie with minimal expectations, given the number of reviews I had read that trashed it.  This is no masterpiece, but not a terrible flick.  Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play characters who have little in common, save for the fact that they each have diagnoses of terminal cancer. To pack as much life as possible into their limited time, they collaborate in writing a ""Bucket List,"" a to-do list of things to do before they die:  skydiving, car-racing, world travel, etc.  In the end, the Grim Reaper wins out but not before the characters find meaning in their lives.

Of course, such an endeavor is facilitated if you leave your family or have a multimillionaire buddy and a private jet to bankroll such a quest.  You must suspend your disbelief for much of this movie.  For example, Nicholson's character has his head shaved but is in the hospital long enough for his hair to grown back.  What kind of HMO is he on?  The movie's end is somewhat of a formulaic tearjerker, so have some Kleenex on hand.

In the end,  we are all terminal.  We do not know if we have days or decades left to live.  Perhaps this movie will inspire viewers to compose their own ""Bucket List"" and get busy living their dreams.  Not a masterpiece, but not a bad movie either.",1214438400,,1278,4.548245614035087

3260009,4,B000YAF4MA,"The '07 release `The Bucket List' is one of those films that become more meaningful the older you are. A young audience will for the most part find this to be silly, irrelevent and unrelated to where they are at the present time in life, while the older, fifty-five plus viewer (like myself) will view this as a wake-up call and cause one to re-evaluate what one deems important and worthwhile. This film is truly a reflection of real life, the young unconcerned with the inevitable and the questions it posits, the aging begrudgingly accepting and learning to deal with the allotment of time remaining.

Yes this is a film designed to draw a specific audience and stars two of Hollywood's most respected senior actors to attract that target group. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are superb and play off each others strengths magnificently. If you're looking for something a little bittersweet and thoughtful populated with some of the most breathtaking scenic landscapes on the planet why not give this one a try.

3260011,5,B000YAF4MA,"I don't give five stars very often, but this movie deserves every one. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are top-notch in this film, as are the other actors, the directing, the cinematography, and the incredibly excellent script.

The basic story: Two men meet in a hospital room as they are being treated for cancer. They both find out the same day that they only have six months to a year to live. They make a list of things they want to do before they die, and set out to do them. In the process, the true gold in this film is illuminated. It isn't in the things the two men do, but is in the developing relationship between the two men, and especially what happens with Jack Nicholson's character. There is even a touch of the mystical that sneaks up on you at the end.

I won't say any more, because I don't want to spoil anything. Just see the movie. Though it isn't one you can get up and walk away from to get a snack. Everything is needed in this film to tell the story. And again, I cannot state strongly enough how incredibly excellent the script is. The dialog is wonderful without ever striking a false note. The story is completely believable, and never once do you think that something isn't plausible, or that something doesn't sit right.

I was a bit worried that this movie would be maudlin and/or depressing and/or incredibly sad, but it isn't. This movie is instead an affirmation of life. There are laugh-out-loud moments (again, fabulously excellent dialog!), and there are some moments when I cried--sometimes not because something bad happened, but because something wonderful did.

This is, by all accounts, a rather serious film with a few funny moments intertwined. Jack Nicholson is very good at playing the self-absorbed millionaire who finally gets a heart and Morgan Freeman does a great job of finding meaning in life wherever and whenever he can. Many have complained about the film's lack of real adventure--especially when it comes to the scenes from far away lands--but I have to admit that I am glad that wasn't the main focus; otherwise, it would have become a rather shallow film. Instead, this is a deep philosophical film, in the lightest manner possible, about the lives we live. When we come to the end of our journey, it's not the riches we obtain or the material wealth we've acquired that will matter, it's who we are, what we've done, and what we'll leave behind that will matter most. And that's a lesson Nicholson's character will take with him to the grave. As for Freeman, he was reminded that his life wasn't a failure simply because he didn't live his dream as a college professor but was indeed a success because of the legacy he'll be leaving behind--in his family.",1213833600,,1271,4.7040358744394615

The chief problem is that Justin Zackham's debut big-screen screenplay is predicated on so many live-before-dying clichs that the entire venture doesn't feel honest despite the star presence of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Zackham's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is much too manipulative to be affecting, and the roles he provides the two veteran actors don't allow them to leverage their talents to build believable characters. Can you tell I didn't like the movie much?

The plot concerns itself with pompous health-care billionaire Edward Cole, who finds himself in his own hospital sharing a room with trivia-obsessed mechanic Carter Chambers. Ironically, Edward is the one who insists upon two patients to each room to cut overhead costs. Both are terminal cases there to receive cancer treatments with little if any chance of survival. Unsurprisingly, they enact their own version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odd-Couple/dp/B0000507P8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odd Couple</a>&nbsp;until they bond over a list Carter is compiling of little things he wants to do before he does. Edward naturally has more grandiose ideas of what his ""bucket list"" would be, and off they go on a series of predictably drawn adventures like skydiving, race-car driving and traveling to exotic places around the world. I find the travel sequences particularly amusing since it's obvious the actors were edited into travelogue footage. Deep-seeded regrets come to the surface on their journey - Edward's estrangement from his daughter and Carter's look back on an academic life unfulfilled and a marriage that has grown stale. There's no point in describing anything further since the whole point of the film is dealing with the inevitable.

As Edward, Nicholson comes across as oddly schizophrenic. The actor's typically excessive moments are followed by surprisingly understated ones, and as a whole, his performance never connects the dots. Freeman fares marginally better as Carter, but his work here feels more like retread. Again, he provides the stoic voiceover and wizened wisdom he has been providing since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption/dp/B0002J4ZWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption</a>.

He is so uncharacteristically restrained and non-committal in the role that the coda has little emotional impact. Relegated even further to the sidelines are Beverly Todd as Carter's wife, Rob Morrow as Edward's doctor, and in a silly bit part, Rowena King as a chic woman drawn to Carter in a bar. I'm not surprised that the 2008 DVD is bereft of significant extras - no commentary track, no making-of featurette,  just a five-minute short, ""Writing a Bucket List"" with Zackham explaining the genesis of the movie's concept, plus a disposable John Mayer video for the closing credits song, ""Say"", which is, by the way, a typical John Meyer song.

3260014,5,B000YAF4MA,"Whether you've written a list of the things you want to do with your life or just let them run through your mind, this becomes the ""bucket list""...the list of things you want to do before kicking the bucket.  The two main characters in this movie faced with the reality of death on the near horizon decide to live in the moment and find joy in the daily events of life.

The movie begins with a cut throat businessman (Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole) and a true gentleman (Morgan Freeman as Carter Chambers) trapped in the same hospital room.  Not immediate friends -- in fact they couldn't be more different but that allows each of them to grow and challenge each other.

Their journey begins with their escape from the hospital where they begin their travels over the world...completing their list of things to do along the way.  The list itself involves both general accomplishments and gestures of kindness. Crossing off each item is a milestone full of smiles for both.

While most of the movie is carried by the main characters...their interaction with others truly conveys their personalities.  Like place Edward in the boardroom ...full of power and control...stating his ""no exceptions...two to a hospital room policy"" which of course he wants the exception when he finally gets sick but is stuck sharing a room.  Then you have Carter who finds so much of his personal joy and accomplishment with his family...supporting and loving time with them. Life has tests just like in the movie...people make choices...and it isn't about pass or fail...but rather what is right for you.

As a whole, I think this movie is one of genuine heart...family...the moments in life that take your breath away.  If you're looking for action...it has its funny skydiving moment among others but isn't that kind of movie.  There is humor that made me laugh so hard that I cried and yet given the subject matter...moments of loss like death are sad. It is a mixture...just like many of the metaphors used throughout.  In the end of your life...measure yourself by those that measure themselves by you...but live for the joy in the moment...as one doesn't need to get a death sentence to know that death could be sooner than we'd like to face.",1213747200,,2229,4.776041666666667
3260015,4,B000YAF4MA,"(3.5 *`s)  You've probably seen the previews, so much elaboration isn't needed, but `Bucket List' is still a worthy journey even if the plot is laid out for you already.  Sweet, sage, and funny, Rob Reiner delivers another heartwarming gem that's rejuvenating to watch.

They couldn't be more opposite.  Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is a wealthy owner of hospitals where the frills are fleeting at best.  ""We run hospitals, not health spas,"" Edward brashly tells his potential clients.  ""Two guests to a room, no exceptions.""  Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is mild and wise.  He is a mechanic at a garage supporting his family, but is an academic at heart and a trivia expert who would make Cliff Claven blush.  A fellow colleague is always trying to stump him with questions from a trivia book, and Carter's favorite past time is to blurt out the answers (questions really) while watching 'Jeopardy'.

You guessed it.  They both have cancer and have to share a room in one of his hospitals.  Thomas* (whose real name is Matthew, but is too hard for Edward to keep track of) is his assistant.  He can't have his own room because it would be bad PR not to follow his own rules.  Edward does get top service by his doctor (Rob Morrow who plays a far different MD than he did on `Northern Exposure'.)  The odd couple take a while to warm up to each other.  Each is absorbed in his own interests, and each has foibles that would annoy anyone.

As their prospects both turn terminal, Edward comes across Carter's ""bucket list"".  Meant to be a whimsical exercise from Carter's philosophy professor, it gets them thinking about using their precious last moments to do what they haven't done before.  Edward has the money but Carter has the wisdom, so sorting out their priorities turns from a final blessing to a final battle.  Carter, who always wanted to be a history professor, decides to take up Edward's offer to take a whirlwind tour of the world and discover the joys of skydiving and race car driving to name just two.  (""You gonna drive it or give it a dress?"" asks an impatient Edward to Carter the mechanic who would truly appreciate the opportunity.)

This is all to the chagrin of Virginia, (also Ginny)[Beverly Todd], Carter's devoted nurse wife.  (""You're a fool who's figured out a way not have cancer,"" she chides her husband.  And to Edward:  ""My husband is not for sale."")  Carter rekindles Edward's ability to think deeply.  He offers Edward the challenge that below the surface relationships and getting one's house in order really matter.  It's not just about the fun.

Once they're on the road, they have several disagreements.  One of the best merits of the movie is how it can transition from fun and funny to philosophical.  Some may find the whole affair ponderous, but I loved the way both grapple emotionally, physically, and intellectually to the challenges that death provides.  If you liked books and movies like '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tuesdays-with-Morrie/dp/B00008L3SE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tuesdays with Morrie</a>,' then surely 'Bucket List' should appeal to you.

We've all seen ""The Little Old Lady from Pasadena"" routine so often:  Gramps or granny is in a hot rod, saying displaced things like ""cool"" and ""far out.""  It usually is funny and offensive at the same time.  This factor couldn't be more remote from the film.  There's never a bitter aftertaste when watching the elderly men doing young things.  It's all done thoughtfully and tastefully.  The dialogue is excellent.  The jokes are funny; the questions posed are interesting, but without the dead ends, for they provide some thoughtful answers as well.

Watching this film reminds me that watching a three-and-a-half-star film can sometimes be more rewarding than watching a full five-star film.  In the end, 'The Bucket List' is a feel good movie with some substance that should be put on your movie ""list"".

The scene where they are in the hospital is depressing and very real.  Everything else is third rate and filled with situations that are ridiculous.  Even when they were traveling the locations where boring and you felt as if they weren't even there.  I have the respect for both of these A-list actors especially Jack Nicholson. He is an institution.  And Morgan Freeman is top notch in this performance.  However, they had chemistry but you couldn't really figured out how a business tycoon could have a hear.  It was entertaining but not really moving because we all have bucket list but throughout the course of a lifetime we don't write off everything in our lists.  We all don't have a friend with millions to help.  So it wasn't realistic instead it was materialistic.  It tried so hard to be a moving film but it fell flat and felt forced.  This is a very good film that is fun to watch and has a pairing that is really strange but a wise decision.  Please don't find my comments to cruel or vain.  I appreciate the sentiment and the message does sink in but I would rather spend my days with my loved ones than with some friend.

I must admit I was curious to see what was on the 'bucket list' of the characters and I was prepared to find myself in for a rollicking good time. What I didn't expect was to be taken completely by surprise at the depth of emotions I felt as I watched Freeman and Nicholson portray the two main characters.

By now you know that both men are faced with short life expectancies and they set out to do the things they've always wanted to do. What drew me to these two was the fact that they came from such opposite backgrounds. Sure we have the rich white guy and the average-income black guy but as the story unfolds we see who truly is the richest person. For my money, it is Freeman's character since his riches are counted in people and love rather than cold hard cash.

As the two travel the world in their quest to complete their bucket list, the bond that is formed is real yet fragile. There were times when I could do nothing but cry but also times when I was reminded that sometimes in the face of desperation it is better to laugh. Nicholson is superb acting as the know-it-all millionaire who can't seem to untangle his hospital cords without help!

Kudos should be given to Sean Hayes for his portrayal of the assistant to Nicholson's rich-guy character. It takes a confident actor to hold his own on screen with both Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson.

3260021,4,B000YAF4MA,"Both Freeman and Nicholson have made their share of poignant (read: soppy) coming-to-terms movies in the past ten years. The Bucket List is not one of them.

It could be seen as a buddy flick in which two near-strangers conspire to race death to the finish line by cramming a lifetime's worth of unfulfilled dreams into an ever-closing window of opportunity. The Bucket List is more than that.

This is Nicholson's movie, though fact is artfully subtle until the very end. Reiner's invisible hand lets the script and characters take their respective paths without cliche, or excessive use of violins in the backing track.

Though the cover art might lead one to think otherwise, this is not a happy/funny movie in the traditional Hollywood sense and, thus, it is (thankfully) neither blockbuster nor Oscar-bound.

Nicholson does very well with his role, but it's the same type of character we've seen him play many times before. The same goes for Morgan Freeman. Both are excellent actors, but they really aren't treading new territory with this outing.

Also, the story is rather predictable and the characters seem to be cardboard cutouts.

So why 4 stars?

This movie has a lot of heart and delivers a beautiful message. It causes the watcher (or it SHOULD cause) to reflect inward and take a good look at himself (or herself). What am I doing with my life? How is my life affecting others? How do I want to be remembered?

Sappy? Yes. Sentimental? Yes.

Their acting makes this story come to life, getting watchers very involved with their lives dealing with terminal cancer.  Their ""Bucket List"" travels are very interesting, and you see very picturesque locations, including the Taj Mahal and The Great Wall of China.  I dare you to watch this movie and not be moved to tears at times.  To demonstrate the deepness of thought from this movie, here's what Morgan Freeman said that Phaeroes in Egypt had to answer before they could be admitted into the afterlife: 1. Have you found joy in your life?, and 2. Have you brought joy into the lives of others?  Answer those questions for yourself, then be sure to watch this powerful movie.

3260024,4,B000YAF4MA,"Selecting a category for this very fine film results in the all-encompassing label 'mixed media', for lack of a better term.  It is smart (with an excellent script by Justin Zackham), addresses some important social issues, and it has moments of touching tenderness and equal moments of very sold comedy. AND it greatly benefits from the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, two consummate actors playing out a theme that is unexpectedly a solid study of friendship and love.

Carter (Morgan Freeman) narrates the story: Carter gave up his dreams for a college education and major career to support his surprise child from his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has worked as a mechanic to support his own family, including his son Roger (Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son in real life also!). After his children have all become successful, Carter is suddenly  diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is hospitalized for chemotherapy, only to be placed in the same room with the wealthy and cantankerous owner of the hospital, Edward (Jack Nicholson) who also has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is also in the hospital for chemotherapy.  Edward's only 'friend' (he has basically alienated the world through his behavior) is his assistant Thomas (an excellent Sean Hayes) who tends to his every need.  Gradually the two disparate men grow into a friendship united by the common bond that they both must face impending death. Together they create 'the bucket list' - things they want to do before dying, and because of Edward's wealth, they leave the hospital on a worldwide adventure of skydiving, racing cars, visiting the pyramids, etc. The manner in which these two elderly men bond casts a warm glow over the film without ever touching on the maudlin risk of communication. They simply grow in their appreciation of life as they learn from each other.

Freeman and Nicholson are in peak form here and the supporting cast is very fine.  But special credit must go to director Rob Reiner for giving us yet another film about humanism that would enrich the lives of anyone who takes the time to watch this very fine film.

A Universal DVD

This is a story that coveys the close relationship that develops between two utterly different men that must share the same hospital room after being both diagnosed with advanced terminal cancer. The first, Edward Cole- Jack Nicholson- is the CEO that runs the hospital and is a ruthless persona and the second is a mechanic, Carter- Morgan Freeman-, who wanted in his youth to be a history teacher but life circumstances did not allow him to do so. They share the common adversities of the infirmity and they, ant the same time, share a long trip that will tie the relationship even further.

One day, Carter starts to write a ""Bucket List"" containing all the things that he would like to do before he dies and Cole finds it out. Afterward, they decide to write the ""Bucket List"" together and start going on marvelous trips around the world and sharing precious moments and becoming the best of friends.  Two utterly different persons become the closest friends ever in the last months of their lives.

What really stroke me about this DVD was that it not only applies to two terminal cancer patients: What stroke me the most is its universality. If we think a little deeper, it could apply to two or more persons sharing similar adversities- or joyfulness for that matter- and relying on each other for comfort, understanding, and the sharing of knowledge and experiences.

The performances of the two principal actors are outstanding and make you laugh and cry at different times during the performance.

Rob Reiner has made a remarkable film about choosing how you live and die, regardless of the circumstances. Even if you are not aging, terminal or a wealthy person, you can have your own bucket list.

I'm not trying to be contrary, but I'll disagree a bit with that recommendation.  Not because the movie isn't worth it, but more because the Blu-ray disc version is relatively sparce on extras and also because the long-term value for this disc/package doesn't seem high enough to get over the threshold I'd would normally set for recommending purchase versus rental.

The film itself is certainly worth viewing, so at least do yourself the favor of renting via Unbox or any other service you prefer.  While the subject matter is sad and somewhat depressing (two victims of cancer or other terminal diseases bond while sharing a hospital room) to begin with, the journey the two individuals make is heartwarming and somewhat uplifting.

The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 97 minutes.  The first major portion of the film deals with the main characters finding out about their illnesses and living through (mostly suffering through) treatment for same.  That segment is fairly depressing and not necessarily easy to get through.  It is worth watching just to educate yourself on what life with cancer or a tumor is like, and especially what life while being treated for such things would be like.

Once past that part of the film, the story that was promised in trailers and advertisements for the movie comes through, that of a pair of friends that go off to do the things on their 'bucket list' -- a list of things to be done before kicking the bucket.

Seeing these two great actors playing these roles and doing a great job in portraying their characters is well worth the price of admission here.  They both are living legends, and both do a great job of playing believable characters.  Additionally, the director for the film is none other than Rob Reiner, himself a legandary director.  A genuine A team of talent.

See this movie.  It is most definitely recommended viewing.  Purchase decision really comes down to what you want from a Blu-ray disc or DVD package.  Basic movie? It's here.  A few extras? Yeah, there are a few here, and those that are here aren't bad, but overall the bundle is weak and leaves the feeling that there should have been more.",1213228800,,2289,4.795918367346939

To know that these chaps will most likely die by the end makes it all the more important to see how they decide to enjoy their last months on Earth and accomplish all the things they never got around to or never had the courage to in their lives.  There is no more time to procrastinate, as it's now or never for both Carter (Freeman) and Edward (Nicholson).  The fine performances of the supporting cast, namely Sean Hayes as Edward's personal assistant and Carter's wife, make the viewer see the illness from all sides, not just from the eyes of the patient, but also from the family who wants to nurture and protect till the very end, but needs to learn to let go in these final months in order for the men to fulfil their life long dreams.  The concept of a Bucket List is easily applied to anyone, and hopefully you will not be faced with the grave diagnoses that these characters must deal with; don't put off till tomorrow what you can reach for today, and while you have the time on this Earth, grab your life and LIVE IT, don't die with regrets and unreached dreams, for this will only make for a lonely end.

Morgan Freeman plays the part of a mechanic, Carter Chambers, who wanted to be a history teacher. Because he was broke and black and his wife was pregnant, he did not get a formal education.

3260042,2,B000YAF4MA,"This is a painfully sentimental movie about love and death. You would be a hard soul indeed if you could sit through this without choking just a little. What makes it worth watching is that it calls the question of the bucket list: just what would you do if you knew your time was limited?

If you're willing to stay with it, it also calls for two more reflections:

*What sort of things are on your list? Is it mostly a check-off of things that other people agree are important or are they things that really, deeply matter to you?

*Your time is limited whether you know it or not, so what's stopping you from doing what's on your list?

The movie itself requires that you drift off a little: the outside shots are so artificial that you feel like you're watching a car commercial or the weather report on TV.
The acting consists mostly of Nicholson and Freeman being themselves-or at least the screen versions. On two occasions, they try to expand their range and the results are disastrous. Freeman tries to express fear when he's about to jump from an airplane. Nicholson goes for deep emotion when he delivers a eulogy at Freeman's funeral.
There are two cameos worth mentioning: Beverly Todd as Freeman's wife is so beautiful that you can barely notice the fine job she does.

I really like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman and ultimately, I think that's what sold me about seeing this and now I'm glad that I did.
The chemistry between Morgan and Jack was amazing.  This is definately one of the most fun and uplifting movies I'd seen in a while and yes I cried in it, but also there were moments of laughter too.  Edward Cole (Nicholson) is wealthy and through his money, he and Carter Chambers (Freeman) do things like touring the world, race car driving and skydiving.
Other than the cheesy dialogue and some predictability, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's a feel good movie with a lesson that you shouldn't need to have a death sentance over you to start living.  Also being faced with death doesn't mean you can't live out the rest of your time rather than fall into depression and accept your fate.

Jack Nicholson was his usual self, sometimes streaching the boundaries of credulity -  especially with a manic-depressive persona.  Morgan Freeman is a very good actor and turns in a respectable, if predictable performance.  One star was taken away for using stock footage of famous places.  eg The scene in Africa with wildabeast crossing a river is a favorite of tourists with cameras.  The one in Egypt was also hard on the eyes.  The other star deduction was for the inability of the director/editor to make the story flow.
While I actually enjoyed the story line, the movie never made it to where I was able to suspend my disbelief and become involved with the characters.

At first Carter and Edward don't exactly hit it off but it isn't long before they forge a friendship. When they each learn that by coincidence they have six months to a year to live, they embark on a trip to accomplish certain lifelong dreams and personal goals before they die. The list of things to do is called The Bucket List because it's a list of things to do before they ""kick the bucket.""

Of course, because Edward Cole is wealthy many scenes in this movie become almost miraculously possible. They travel the world by private corporate jet; and they live more in just a few weeks than most people ever do in a lifetime.

Of course, life has its ways of surprising just about any of us; so still the plot could go just about anywhere. How will Beverly, Carter's wife, react to all this? Will she understand and remain patient while Carter lives out a few lifelong dreams or will she want her husband home NOW? Will Carter and Edward be able to keep their cool when they are stranded in Asia during a monstrous snowstorm and they are not allowed to fly? What happens if one of them gets very sick along the way? What about Edward's refusal to make up with his daughter who disowned him long ago--will he ever decide to approach her or will he remain obstinate in his refusal to even meet with her? The results may surprise you. No plot spoilers here, folks--you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!

As a cancer survivor who is finishing my own chemotherapy soon, I will add that some of the side-effects of the chemotherapy they receive are exaggerated. However, I think director Rob Reiner added these elements to the film to make it somewhat more dramatic.

Overall, The Bucket List is an excellent movie; and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman turn in superlative performances that proves these guys can still act better than the vast majority of actors ever could. Beverly Todd does a great job as Carter's wife; and Sean Hayes also does well as Edward Cole's personal assistant Thomas. I highly recommend this film for fans of these terrific actors; and people comfortable with the subject matter will appreciate this motion picture as well.",1208908800,53,2788,4.693251533742331
3260047,4,B000YAF4MA,"Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a relatively happy man. Carter is a self-taught man with a thirst for knowledge that is never quite quenched. He has three children, a devoted wife, and is an ace mechanic. A telephone call one morning from the hospital changes everything. The operation he had months before was unsuccessful and has terminal cancer in the brain. Carter finds himself in the hospital participating in a ""promising"" experimental treatment. Carter's roommate in the hospital turns out to be none other than the CEO of the hospital, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson). Edward has built a fortune and an empire by turning failing hospitals around into relatively profitable businesses. However, as Edward soon learns profitable hospitals aren't necessarily customer friendly or the nicest places to stay. Edward has a similar illness as Carter and the men from two different worlds soon develop a friendship. One day, while waiting for his test results Carter begins writing a ""bucket list"" a list of all the things he would like to do before he ""kicks the bucket"". When he receives news that he only has about six months to live at the most, Carter abandons the idea. Edward, however, won't allow Carter to give up so easily and together the two men take off on a journey around the world living out their every whim, from skydiving, to eating lunch on one of the Great Pyramids, to racing expensive sports cars. Along the way the two men learn a great deal about friendship and themselves.

THE BUCKET LIST is a fairly engaging, sentimental movie. The movie has a strong emotional appeal, especially if anyone has lost a parent or parental figure in their lives. Freeman and Nicholson make a great team and I wish they would have done more movies together in their careers. On the negative side, the opening and concluding segments of THE BUCKET LIST are a bit confusing. Also, I was a bit disappointed that the film didn't have more of Carter and Edward participating in more adventures. Despite the confusing moments and a lack of adventures, THE BUCKET LIST is still a pretty decent film with a lot of heart and an important message about living life to the fullest.",1208736000,,2180,4.8445040214477215

There was a serious undertone to it, especially with Morgan's character, and later on Jack's. Some of it was kind of formulaic, but I did expect that. What made the movie was the subtle moments between the two leads. The nuances of their banter, the crazy humor in the most awful times of the characters experiences, the total hilarity infused in these scenes had me busting a gut. So damn funny. Good messages too. I like Morgan in everything I've ever seen him in, he's one of the best. But Jack really stole the show. He totally nailed this role. I think this is the funniest, most honest performance I've seen, not only from him, but in a long time. I can't stress enough - see this movie just for Jack and consider everything else a bonus. Having acknowledged the formulaic parts, things that could have been deeper, more fleshed out, I really dug the ending. That's where the movie, in my opinion, shed the formula.

Obviously Nicholson and Freeman have great chemistry but it's not like this movie is a lot more exciting than showing them playing cards or something. I love Freeman's narrations but: a) I don't think the Nicholson character earns his and b) enough is enough of them.

Although the odds are slim of finding a comrade in dying -- and one with unlimited wealth, the premise of the film: to list and act on the things we want to do before kicking the bucket, is real.  There is much to learn here.  And you will find yourself laughing and crying -- sometimes at the same time.

3260053,5,B000YAF4MA,"Saw this one in the theater.  This was an excellent film with acting greats Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as 2 older gentlemen, both diagnosed with terminal cancer.  They meet when they become hospital roommates through operations and chemotherapy treatments (and heads in the toilet bowl).  They are an unlikely pair of opposites who find consolation within the tender caring sides of each other.

Jack is a billionaire, previously married 4 times, currently single, and estranged from his one child, a daughter.  Morgan is a family man, married with children and grandchildren.  Jack is a little outspoken and wild.  Morgan is like a quiet southern gentleman.  They become great friends in the hospital and decide to make a ""Bucket List"" (a list of things to do before they kick the bucket).  So, with Jack's money and Jack's personal assistant to make all arrangements, and Jack's private plane, they take off to do all the things on the list.

Although in content it is certainly sad, it is also uplifting that they get to live the rest of their time doing some very special things as well as bonding in a beautiful loving friendship.  There are lots of laughs, too.  This movie will have you both laughing and crying as you go through the final months of the lives of these two men.

On a side note, I can understand if you are leery of seeing a movie about 2 men dying of cancer.  I was a little uneasy about the subject matter myself, since I lost my 53 year old mother, 64 year old father, and 40-year old brother to cancer.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and was glad I watched it.  And, of course, the acting job was superb.  I even took my 15-year old granddaughter to see the movie.  I asked her what rating she would give it, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being outstanding.  She gave it a 9 --and I certainly agree!

Note: This ""Bucket List"" thing is a great idea, not that I'm expecting to cross over anytime soon.  I kept a mental Bucket List for awhile and some things that were on it I wound up doing, so even though it might seem too expensive, or unlikely for whatever reason, it's a good idea to make the list. A couple of places that I wanted to see, but didn't think I could afford, were: San Diego, Denver, the Mayan ruins in Mexico, the Canadian Rockies, and Alaska.  Somehow, the trips manifested just by thinking about them and somehow they were affordable.  I even went to the Canadian Rockies TWICE (2004 and 2007) because the deal was so good.

So, some more things on my bucket list are: Aspen/Mt. Estes/Vail, Colorado (no, I don't ski), a Barry Manilow concert in London, Machu Piccu Peru, Mt. Shasta California, Sedona Arizona, Stonehedge, Avalon, Ireland, a Panama Canal cruise, Lourdes France, Australia, and New Zealand.  I probably left something out, but there it is.  I have written it down and now it's official, so somehow these things can also begin to manifest.  I suggest you write down your Bucket List, too.",1205193600,,2963,4.5625

If one can find balance in one's life and utilize every day wisely, I guess one will be a content person always. If one can live by the US Army's theme ""Be All that You Can Be"" every single day, I think one would have lived life well.

3260056,3,B000YAF4MA,"""There was a survey once, a thousand people asked, `If they could know in advance, would they want to know the exact day of their death?'--96% said no."" This is the core base of this film as the two main characters find themselves pushed into the other 4%.

These two characters are billionaire tycoon Edward Cole (played by Jack Nicholson) and car mechanic Carter Chambers (played by Morgan Freeman) that are both terminally ill with cancer, have both been given less than a year to live, and find themselves sharing the same hospital room. During the weeks they spend at the cancer ward, Carter makes a ""bucket list"" for fun, but Edward takes it more seriously and wants to start checking things off. So, after a fight with his wife Carter and Edward embark on a luxurious tour of all the finest locations in the world--the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Himalayas, the Mediterranean, a Safari, etc.--as well as crazy stunts like: sky diving, racing sports cars, and even getting a tattoo.

This is one of those warm, cozy films that you can use for pure entertainment, and it works well. The script is horrible but you do not notice it as much since the performances from the two leads more than make up for it. There are plenty of ""how could..."" (especially the fact that a billionaire would share a common hospital room in the first place) but to enjoy this film you have to take everything as it is presented.

The once thing that did upset me was the portrayal of Carter's wife as the nagging wife who only naturally would be devastated finding out your husband is leaving on a world tour just after hearing the news that he will only be around for about a year longer.

Still, this is one of those films that despite the poor production quality (it is really poor when the pyramids look like fake back-drops in our CGI-obsessed world) the performances by two of Hollywood's most veteran actors (both Oscar winners) make The Bucket List something you might want to add to your list of movies seen.",1202256000,,2002,4.599439775910364

3260058,4,B000YAF4MA,"Rob Reiner directs ""The Bucket List,"" a little film with a big message that boasts two mega stars who only epitomize in these roles that for which they have become noted and respected in countless others.

Jack Nicholson plays Edward Cole, the quintessentially cynical billionaire with the same world-weary ennui and uncertainty that he brought to the character of Warren Schmidt in the 2002 film ""About Schmidt.""  For years he wheels and deals as one of the big movers and shakers in the health care industry.  As his collapsible morality and an inflexible adherence to his people-unfriendly hospital policies transmutes handsomely into a larger bank account but yields scant personal relationships, Cole thinks himself far too savvy to believe in a higher being yet preens with self-satisfaction regarding his sophisticated tastes and appreciation of the best of the material things the world has to offer.  Vintage Nicholson.

Enter the perfect foil, the wonderfully elegant Morgan Freeman.  He  imbues the character of Carter Chambers, a wisdom-seeking egghead auto mechanic who sacrificed an education and a more promising future for the sake of his growing family with his ever-present serenity in the face of any adversity and nobility that any knight of Arthur's legendary Round Table would be proud to possess.  Think the stoically patient and hopeful Red in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tempered to a rich patina where a look conveys a multitude of emotions and elicits immediate audience response.

When cancer strikes both Cole and Chambers, both men's very different lifestyles hover in a holding pattern that targets death within six months.  Unlikely companions, they compose a list of ""things to do before kicking the bucket"" and embark on a journey stocked with once-in-a-lifetime experiences and friendship-forging moments where each man's perspective is explored through their lives' mistakes and triumphs.  Of course, lessons are learned and thankfully, the audience is allowed a happy, albeit tearful, ending of sorts where this meeting of two opposites produces a pleasant mellow glow that is meant to initiate reflection and illuminate one's own legacy.

Bottom line?  ""The Bucket List"" may be a comedy that laughs in the face of death, but more so, it evokes a bittersweet reaction that begs the audience to look within and define the importance of life.  Some may argue that some of the film's adventure sequences seem a bit overly sentimental and overstocked with big questions that cannot be answered during a two-hour time frame. Maybe the lessons seem to be learned too fast.  In the same respect, it could be said that Nicholson and Freeman may just be portraying themselves without the need for character definition, but honestly, I don't think any of this really matters.  The film captures the essence of Reiner's purpose; the audience definitely empathizes with both of these esteemed actors.  Not for a moment was I bored by their performances.  Rather, I was amazed at how effortless both of these American institutions make their craft seem.  Happily, ""The Bucket List"" fully delivers what it intends:  a satisfying film fraught with life and death, friendship and family, laughter and tears.  Recommended with the caveat that for those who have lost someone to cancer, the hospital sequences will serve as a sad reminder of this experience.

3260060,5,B000YAF4MA,"Morgan Freeman plays a brainiac, a highly intellectual, intelligent man who, as he says, ""spent 45 years greased up under the hood of a car"" so that his children would have the kind of life he'd always dreamt about for himself.

As was true for many men of his generation, he wanted to be sure that his children ""would never want for anything and they didn't."" He sacrificed and worked and toiled for a lifetime, always putting his family's needs ahead of his own long-cherished dream to get a college degree and become a history professor. And his lifetime of self-sacrifice bore much fruit: His three children went to college and became successful professionals.

Nicholson and Freeman forged a bond, and became friends despite the fact that the two men were complete opposites and would never have crossed paths in day-to-day life, were it not for their illness.

Nicholson lived an life that was the diametrical opposite of Freeman's character; a life which was characterized by debauchery, lasciviousness and general over-indulgence, always keeping a keen eye open, looking out for Number One. His legacy is a business, which has made him a multi-millionaire.

In the few weeks the men have left, Freeman gives Nicholoson a few life lessons about real success and love and the joy that can be found in self-sacrifice and Freeman shows Nicholson that the love we leave behind and the life example we leave behind can be our most enduring and important life legacy.

And Nicholson gives Freeman an extraordinary gift. Nicholson shows Freeman the world that he's spent decades reading about in books.

My favorite line in the movie: According to Egyptian lore, you're asked two questions at the gates of heaven: First, Did you experience joy in your lifetime? And two, did you bring joy to someone else in your lifetime?

Those two questions can leave a soul with a lot to think about.

The Bucket List is one those unusual movies that leaves you with an intellectual and spiritual aftertaste, where you go away pondering the many layers of messages contained in the rich, thoughtful dialogue. The metaphysical riches to the side, it's also a funny movie and Nicholson is in fine form.

I would highly recommend The Bucket List. Well worth your time and money.",1201737600,15,2262,4.885117493472585
3260061,3,B000YAF4MA,"Edward Cole (Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Freeman) have terminal cancer.  They are opposites, with Edward being a rich CEO and Carter being a car mechanic.

Nicholson and Freeman are always good, and ""The Bucket List"" is no exception.  They give their usual standout performances.  On the downside, this is a movie that sets out to make views shed a few tears.  This gives the film a feeling of trying to be more important than it really is.  If that could somehow be toned down, this would be a better movie.  There are some good laughs though, and that is the films saving grace.

3260062,5,B000YAF4MA,"By what they've accomplished?  According to soft-spoken cancer patient, Carter (Freeman), you measure a man's life by who measures their lives by yours.

Edward Cole probably was a lot of people's yardstick.  He was wealthy, powerful, and he ran hospitals.

""We run hospitals--not resorts!"" E. Cole (Nicholson)

If Cole hadn't been so mercenary, he'd never have been stuck with another patient in his hospital room.  At first, the very wealthy Cole doesn't care for the soft-spoken auto mechanic, but as time goes on the two develop a friendship--and Cole begins to both share food and care for Carter.

When Edward sees Carter's 'Bucket List,'(a list of items he wants to accomplish before he kicks the bucket) he realizes it's something the two of them can do--and says they should.  That's when the two cancer patients break out of the hospital and go on a world tour. Together, they write out a new bucket list and work to make each other's dreams come true.

""Bucket List"" is sentimental, predictable, and yet more than my words can encompass.  The film's not just about dying, but friendship, and finding joy to spread to others--even at the worst times in a person's life.

In my opinion, the three best aspects of this film were Morgan Freeman's outstanding narration and Sean Hayes' well-done portrayal of Cole's ever-present assistant (Thomas). Another nod goes to actress Beverly Todd, who played Virginia Chambers.  Even the young girls in the film were exclaiming how amazing she looked and acted.

But the movies heart is in the right place and it's well acted with gorgeous locations.

  I think the problem is that critics have just gotten too used to handing Rob Reiner movies one star and this one didn't deserve it at all.

3260064,4,B000YAF4MA,"Rob Reiner's ""The Bucket List"" functions with a strong sense of What If: What if you discovered you were terminally ill? What if you finally decided to live your remaining days to the fullest? What if you discovered more in those remaining days than you ever discovered before? Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) are faced with scores of What Ifs when both are diagnosed with cancer and given a finite number of days to live--with Cole's help, Chambers uses that precious time to see the world and experience things he had previously only dreamed of. This is obviously not a new idea for a story like this, and the reality is that most of the film is unrealistic and clich. But it's also touching and meaningful, so I have to give credit where credit is due. Simply put, ""The Bucket List"" is an unabashed tearjerker, a film that's simultaneously witty and sentimental for maximum effect.

The film opens with one of Freeman's voiceover narrations, and that in and of itself is a clich: consider ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Feast of Love"" and ""The Hunting of the President"" and ... I think you get the idea. Anyway, his character's narration acts as a framing device, one that will be filled with the events of the main story. The first character to be established is Chambers, who has worked as a mechanic for the past forty-five years. He's knowledgeable about many things, which is why he's able to watch ""Jeopardy!"" and answer virtually every question. We first see him in his auto shop, answering trivia questions with his co-worker; at that point, he receives a devastating phone call from his wife, one that forces him to drop his cigarette and walk away in a daze. Apparently, the test results from his latest medical exam paint a grim picture for his future.

Soon after, Cole is introduced. A multimillionaire, Cole is savvy and inflexible, with a dry and completely off-putting sense of humor. He also has an affinity for Kopi Luwak coffee, the world's most expensive (and most disgusting--if you really must know why, look it up on your own). He owns a hospital in Los Angeles, and he has a strict policy when it comes to patient lodging: Two beds to a room, no exceptions. Private rooms aren't allowed because, as he puts it, ""I run hospitals, not health spas."" Upon his cancer diagnosis, he's taken in for emergency surgery, after which he's wheeled into the same hospital room occupied by Chambers; at that point, Cole pleads to be given his own room, and never mind the bad PR.

Before long, Cole and Chambers form a companionship of sorts. It would be too much to say that they become fast friends--Cole's personality would make that virtually impossible, especially so soon after they meet. But they definitely tolerate each other, which is probably why Cole is willing to indulge Chambers in his last days. You see, Chambers begins writing what his old history professor called a Bucket List, which is a list of things one wants to do before dying (also known as kicking the bucket); Cole gets a hold of it and convinces Chambers to not only follow the list, but also to add a few exciting things, like skydiving and racecar driving and seeing sights all over the world. Cole would tag along, but merely as a financier and a motivator, not as a confidant. Not at first, anyway.

All this comes as a surprise to Chambers' wife, Virginia (Beverly Todd), who feels that Cole is stealing her husband away during his final days. Chambers would like nothing more than for his wife to understand where he's coming from: he devoted years of his life to her and their children, and now that he's dying, he feels he's earned a little time for himself. Much to Virginia's chagrin, Chambers and Cole set off on their journey, and as you've probably guessed, this journey will be profound, revealing many things about both characters. For one thing, we learn that Chambers had once hoped to be a history professor. We also learn that Cole has endured four failed marriages, one of which introduced his daughter into the world. For reasons I won't reveal, the two haven't spoken in years--this is a golden opportunity for Chambers, who tries to use his knowledge and philosophical wisdoms to urge Cole towards reconciling.

If these themes of self-discovery, friendship, and family seem routine, that's because they are. ""The Bucket List"" doesn't really give us anything new, especially when it comes to the obligatory epiphanies; in stories like this, a character's impending death always makes him or her appreciate life, usually for the first time. But I have to be honest--it's still an effective movie, if not for the story, then for reaffirming our emotions. This applies to both ends of the scale: parts of the film are incredibly funny while other parts are incredibly sad. One of the funnier moments occurs when Cole and Chambers visit the Taj Mahal in India: Cole can't decide on his funeral arrangements. An ordinary burial makes him feel claustrophobic. Cremation is risky because the person may not be completely dead when it happens.

The sadder moments are mostly reserved for the end, and while I won't say what happens, I think you have a pretty good idea. ""The Bucket List"" is not a perfect film, but it's still poignant and endearing, and its sense of humor is generally well placed. There's also a decent performance by Sean Hayes as Thomas, Cole's personal assistant (his real name is Matthew, but Cole found that too Biblical). I'm recommending this film mostly for its well-established but important message of living life to the fullest. Why? Let me answer that with another question: What if?",1200182400,34,5734,4.798582995951417

Sure they didn't change the world, but then again, I was only after a movie and not a historic world event. If you only love Morgan Freeman's voice from the Shawshank then you might just like this too. Great actors. Good plot. A little sad. Loved it....",1200182400,5,480,4.647058823529412
3260067,4,B000YAF4MA,"Director Rob Reiner has made a funny, touching, moving, sad, and poignant film that doesn't try or pretend to be anything than what it is. It sets out on this journey about two men and effectively touches upon all those things I just mentioned, and all those emotions. Mission accomplished. What you see is pretty much what you expect having seen the trailers for the film. It doesn't exactly re-invent the wheel or offer much in the way of surprises, but it doesn't have to. It's about these two men. Their story. And when you have these two particular performers as Edward Cole and Carter Chambers, they raise the film to even greater heights, and make it that much more special and meaningful. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman team up for the first time and, thankfully, the movie is a lot more than just dream casting. They are a brilliant pair, and one wishes they had teamed up a lot sooner than this. As two terminally ill patients, Edward Cole(Nicholson), and Carter Chambers(Freeman), bond while sharing a hospital room. They gradually get better and leave the hospital, but they leave to really experience life and to do things they've always wanted to do before they, you know, kick the bucket. The road trips and adventures the two go on are priceless, but it's the deep characters and nuanced performances here that are front and center. Nicholson is Nicholson, and he proves once again why he is a living legend. You find yourself losing ""Jack"", and seeing ""Edward"". He is amazing. Freeman has always been one of the industry's finest and strongest performers, and here he is his usual wonderful, supportive, and brilliant self. It really is magic seeing the two together. It's never slow or repetitive. The two shine together and make everything better. The only other real co-star here is Will And Grace's Sean Hayes, who is just fine in his role, and offers some laughs of his own. ""The Bucket List"" may be a film where you can tell where it's headed and what will happen, but it doesn't matter at all. It's about the journey getting there, and the journey these two men go on in the last few months they are here on this earth. The commaraderie between them is sparkling, and the dialogue fun and meaningful. It may seem dire, but there is a light that shines thru it all. It definitley doesn't hurt that two of our greatest living actors are leading you thru that light. In the end, the movie may not seem fancy or stick out of the pack, but it's an accomplished film with great perfomers brigning life to great characters. It's funny, sad, moving, and has a firm hold of the heart. I really liked and enjoyed the movie.",1200096000,,2640,4.631130063965885
3260068,5,B000YAF4MA,"The Bucket List is a very enjoyable movie.  There are no hidden plots and no double meanings.  It is simply the story of two men from very different backgrounds facing death from cancer.  This common bond creates strange bed fellows as they share a time in their lives that others can't understand.  They take a journey together and both come away changed for the better.
This movie has hilarious moments and sentimental moments that are a part of living and dying in real life.  They are shown in realistic ways not candy coated or through Hollywood eyes.
I really enjoyed this movie and found it entertaining and not troubling as many deep movies are.  This is not a shallow movie it just does not put guilt on the viewer.
Excellent performances by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman.",1200096000,,785,4.693430656934306
