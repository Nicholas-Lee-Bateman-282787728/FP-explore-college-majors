5116742,4,B0080QOKYS,"This was a gift to a friend who enjoys British comedies.  I thought when purchased that it was some series from the BBC, but turned out to be four separate films of British humor.",1357516800,,179,4.264705882352941

5116746,3,B0080QOKYS,"We're generally fans of most things British. But if you're having visions of Monty Python, Absolutely Fabulous, or Mr. Bean, you'd be well advised to keep looking. These probably fit more into the Romantic Comedy category.

We watched three of the films in their entirety -- ""My Life So Far"", was so slowly and aimlessly meandering that we gave up and moved on -- but found precious few moments of laugh-out-loud cinema.

The acting was good overall, and two of the movies were somewhat interesting, but none were really memorable. We often keep DVDs in our library for future rewatching, but as the final credits rolled, my wife said ""I don't think we need to keep this one.""

P.S. Economical packaging as you might expect -- no special features and no paper inserts, just a single DVD in a case.",1411084800,,797,4.678571428571429
5116747,5,B0080QOKYS,"Colin Firth is, for me, an actor that will be one of those that will be honored for their ""body of work"" sooner, rather than later. Love him. And this is a good selection of a few of his fun ones.",1409270400,,196,3.8048780487804876

5116752,4,B0080QOKYS,Enjoyed all four of the movies.  Hoped there would be some Judi Densch and Helen Mirren type stories.  But all four were fun.,1391644800,,125,4.391304347826087
5116753,5,B0080QOKYS,"Liked them all!  Colin Firth is fun!  Interesting plots and twists. The movie, My Life So Far was an unexpected pleasure.",1390003200,,121,4.714285714285714
5116754,5,B0080QOKYS,These compilation discs are perfect for gift giving. I love the idea of having several movies on one disc for saving space.,1389657600,,123,4.636363636363637
5116755,1,B0080QOKYS,Blurred pictures.  Could not watch it.  Don't waste your money. It looks like they just did a dub off a VHS tape. We can't play it on a high definition TV.,1388620800,,155,3.967741935483871
5116756,5,B0080QOKYS,Great collection of British movies well done!! My Life So Far really terrific! First rate actors and well done productions. A winner if you like British humor.,1388620800,,159,4.925925925925926
5116757,5,B0080QOKYS,"By comparison with what usually passes for comedy in the U. S. today, these four films exemplify why Britain does humor without nudity, naughty words, or insulting the viewer's intelligence. Good value for several evenings of warmth and laughter.",1388361600,,246,5.333333333333333
5116758,2,B0080QOKYS,"I like Colin Firth acting and was the reason why I got this one, but was not too impressed.  Rainy day movies?",1387756800,,110,4.0

5116763,4,B0080QOKYS,"Most of the movies worth watching.  None excited me but did show much of the comedic flair of a  true  British
Comedy. Which I truly find entertaining.  They were relaxing and worth purchasing.  Good for that quite evening's entertainment.",1370563200,,239,5.0256410256410255
5116764,3,B0080QOKYS,"While these movies have their funny moments, I found myself nodding at times.  Many good actors add to the drama and comedy.",1369440000,,124,4.636363636363637
5116765,5,B0080QOKYS,Unfortunatelly I didn't realize that I had already these same frour films included in the 8 film collection I bought at the same time. I chose not to return it because it will make a great present.,1369353600,,197,4.351351351351352

5116768,5,B0080QOKYS,"I was actually looking for a copy of the Movie ""THE ENGLISHMAN WHO WENT UP A HILL BUT CAME DOWN A MOUNTAIN"" and came across this wonderful collection of 4 marvelous films for the price of 1. Who could pass this up? Not me, since we like British movies/series. Fortunately these are all wonderful funny films - quirky, great dialogue, beautiful scenery, and great acting.  So grab a copy. You'll have several happy hours of fun viewing for less than a couple of cups of coffee. Make some popcorn, relax and have a wonderful time figuring out British humor. Great value!",1366243200,5,568,4.623762376237623
5116769,2,B0080QOKYS,"Not sure what I expected, but it was basically not much to do about anything.  I think I prefer the romantic era of the old 1800's movies.",1365379200,,138,4.111111111111111
5116770,2,B0080QOKYS,Very poor color and audio is not consistent. Very hard to hear what is being said. Very sorry I purchased it.,1365292800,3,109,4.238095238095238

5116772,5,B0080QOKYS,All of the movies are of equally high quality. There is a gentility that will appeal to those of a sympathetic nature. Good to see movies without blood and gore. Great performances by all.,1364169600,3,188,4.5588235294117645
5116773,5,B0080QOKYS,This is a set of a really nice set of British films.  Well did not care for Revenge too much,1363219200,,92,3.6
5116774,5,B0080QOKYS,"Worth the money. Loved My Life so Far movie. Others may have found it offensive but I know kids in my neighborhood who do the same things, albeit not so well dressed or articulate. All four movies were winners",1362528000,,209,4.384615384615385
5116775,5,B0080QOKYS,"What a great price for over 6 hours of really good cinema.
The 4 features are all films that first showed from 1994 to 1999. Each is 90 to 118 minutes and all are in widescreen and color. They are loaded with star performers in stellar accomplishments. It is a satisfying mix of comedy, historical drama, romance, and biography. What more can you say except the price is less than renting. And you will want to watch some of the offerings more than once. Unfortunately, for this price you get no subtitles.

A Month by the Lake: An older (Vanessa Redgrave) lady finds romance in a wonderful adaptation of a story by HE Bates.

My Life So Far: Scot lad Fraser lives a somewhat wild childhood and viewers get a very funny accounting of his coming to terms with puberty. Colin Firth is the dad. I'll watch this film again and again.

The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain. What will Welsh townsfolk do to retaliate against surveyors (Ian McNeice, Hugh Grant) claiming their prized local mountain is less than 1000 feet--thus a mere `hill'? Another top winner.

Sweet Revenge: 2 souls fail to complete suicides off London's Tower Bridge. They form a pact to play a deadly game of revenge against those that drove them to the brink. Lots of UK stars.

The price is like buying one and getting 3 free.
These 4 films are also available (a wee tad more $$) in an 8 cinema set:

8523784,3,B0080QOKYS,I didn't think all of these movies should be rated as comedies.  Maybe in the widest definition of the word comedy. But not mine.,1414713600,,129,4.375
