8354114,5,B00275KIOO,"This film is very cerebral and and weird and I'm sure not everyone's cup of tea, but it's in fact the most intelligently funny indie gay film I've seen in the past 10 years. It's about a theatre professor who's trying to write a commercial thriller and his characters rebel, for of a gay SIX CHARACTERS IN SEARCH OF AN AUTHOR, but what's really fascinating about it is the way it demystifies the writing process in a way that, as a writer myself, I found hilariously true. It also contains a wonderful, late performance by Shirley Jones, of all actresses (CAROUSEL, OKLAHOMA, THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY) as a magical muse who gives the film's writer-hero sometimes questionable advice. A gay movie that also sends up gay romance while at the same time celebrating it.",1363478400,,761,4.7293233082706765
8354115,2,B00275KIOO,"Silly bit of nonsense about playwright who loses control of his play to the characters in the thriller he is writing and the actors who portray them.  Cute idea, but never fully realized.  There is some confusion about the whole thing.  Is this a play that is being produced, as it seems to be, given that it is set on a stage?  Or is it a movie, as the audience guy seems to think (acceptable)?  But sometimes the playwright refers to it as a movie as well (not acceptable).  The characters are confusing as well (Sigmund Freud?),. They appear, then disappear, only to reappear again.

Even though it is less than an hour and a half long, it would do much better as a shorter film.  Many of the extended scenes drag on far too long, making the same points over and over again. Many, if not most, of the characters begin to get annoying after awhile.

There are some funny bits in it (a few very funny) but not enough to make up for its overall weaknesses.  It seems more like a student project for a film class rather than a full-fledged movie.",1313971200,,1045,4.34020618556701
8354116,1,B00275KIOO,"This is worse than terrible and it isn't 90 minutes, thank GOD!!!!! It's about 76 minutes long and there is absolutely nothing interesting about it. Shirley Jones must have owed someone a favor, because not even she can pull this one out of the mire. A writer is penning a script and we, the audience, get to see how it plays out on stage, but everyone talks as if it's a movie. Confused? Doesn't matter. Have the fast forward ready, because you're gonna need it.",1302739200,3,463,4.458823529411765
