8594447,5,B00DMD7YWE,"This DVD series (and accompanying book) opened up the world of Indian Cooking for me. I now have a pantry full of spices, the mixie that Rick uses in the DVDs and a passion for Indian cooking that trumps all other cuisines. I find all of Rick's television series to be absolutely delightful - without exception - including the current Venice to Istanbul - but I find this one (India) to be the most compelling. Rick you are a Superstar here in Santa Monica, CA!",1441065600,,461,4.435294117647059
