<i>Hallstein with ""Mr. X""</i>

I was particularly pleased to get this operetta, as the leading lady is none other than the elegantly beautiful Ingeborg Hallstein -- an angel with an angel's voice.  I thought in this show she looked younger than in <i>Wiener Blut</i> and I was right -- sort of.  <i>Zirkusprinzessin</i> was recorded in 1969 and <i>Wiener Blut</i> in 1971.  But those two years made a difference IMHO.  She conveyed much more of an image of sophistication in <i>Wiener Blut</i>.  But that was a more sophisticated role of course. It's not often that a lady says she likes to hear that her husband is attractive to other women.

But her facial expressions in <i>Zirkusprinzessin</i> as she pinged off the repulsive ""Prince Sergius"" were solid gold.  It was wonderful to see her in action.  As the Prince said when she had finished her little speech:  ""<i>Das war deutlich</i>"" (""that was clear"").

And I liked the dramatic faces of Hallstein when she was watching the final act of the show. I thought she looked most beautiful at that point -- though whether that says something sad about me, I don't know.

Amusing that she wore her hair in the same uplifted style in both shows, complete with stars in it.  But it meant that full attention was on her face -- and it is a face worth looking at.

And at the risk of sounding ridiculous, I greatly admired the hat she wore when she arrived in Vienna from Petersburg. It was very elegant and flattering IMHO.  Congratulations to the costume department, I guess.

<i>Some scenes</i>

I hope it is not churlish of me to mention it but the suspension of belief that one needs for operetta was rather stretched by the trapeze artist jumping from high up in the tent onto the back of  a horse. It was quite mad as far as I can see.  A man doing so would surely crunch his balls and break the back of the horse.  It did however make good drama.

There were a few jokes in it but not many.  The second string story did good service there, though -- with the <i>Pelikan</i> scenes being quite hilarious at times.  But the Hungarian dialogue there stumped me. I can make some sort of a fist of understanding most European languages but Hungarian and Finnish are in a world of their own.

And I did learn something amusing from ""Toni"", the second string romantic.  He described the dancing ladies he admired as having ""marzipan legs"".  I would never have thought of that one.  Presumably he meant white.

I am not the first to note that Kalman stole the plot for <i>Zirkusprinzessin</i>  from Millocker's <i>Bettelstudent</i> of 40 years previously.  But operettas do a lot of borrowing from one another so that is not too remarkable.

<i>Translation issues</i>

An amusing thing about the English subtitles:  Towards the end of the show, the German word <i>Lust</i> was translated as ""lust"" -- which sounded quite jarring in the circumstances.  The German means ""pleasure"" or ""enjoyment"" or some such. The translator's lot is not a happy one (to misquote Gilbert & Sullivan) but that was a real boo-boo.  A common one, however.

I am also a bit critical of the way <i>Durchlauch</i> was translated.  It was at times translated as ""Your Serene Highness"", which is indeed its expanded meaning, but <i>Durchlauch</i> is an abbreviation of that, so a translation as simply ""Highness"" would have been more usual.  But German has two words for ""Highness"", <i>Hoheit</i> being the other, so it is another case where there is no perfect translation. <i>Hoheit</i>  is a more elevated rank than <i>Durchlauch</i>.

A complication is that the same person can be addressed both as <i>Durchlauch</i> and <i>Hoheit</i>.  The original distinction seems to have faded and left <i>Hoheit</i> as simply a polite form of address to anyone of <i>Graf</i> status or above.  Since the Russian aristocracy was allegedly involved, <i>Gospodina</i> might have been considered in this case

Mind you, referring to Hallstein as <i>Serene Highness</i> is not unreasonable.  She does indeed come across as serene.

""Highness"" is the English equivalent of <i>Hoheit</i> but usage of ""Highness"" is much more limited.  Only the Queen can bestow that appellation in England.

<i>Technical</i>

The operettas I watch are mostly cinematic versions made for West German TV in the late '60s and mid '70s so I do tend to see the same actors and actresses over and over again.  So I knew well that <i>Wirtin</i> Schlumberger was played by someone I had seen elsewhere.  I could NOT bring it to mind where and when, however,  so I had to look up the filmography of ""Jane Tilden"", who played the part.  I saw her previously as Stasa Kokozow in <i>Graf von Luxemburg</i>

A small technical point.  I watched the show at first on a big modern flat-screen TV and it looked fine.  But then I re-watched it on my small, old-fashioned bedside monitor -- a 19"" RGB monitor.  And it looked much better on the RGB monitor.  Why?  Easy peasy.  My RGB monitor is a CRT relic of the '70s.  My RGB monitor was exactly the sort of monitor the show was recorded for in 1969.

So:  Products of the past work best on the technology of the past:  Another reason for preserving the technology of the past.  And I do put my money where my mouth is.  I have quite a lot of Amiga 500 and Atari ST games gear salted away in various cupboards -- and lots of the  disks  for them too.  You can of course play all that stuff on emulators now but Joe is a games freak and he tells me that the emulators don't do all the old sounds well. Amiga sound was miles ahead of anything else at the time.  It still sounds good.

<i>Overall</i>

There were enough machinations for grand opera but everybody ended up alive and happy, of course, in proper operetta style.  Certainly a great romance.

And the sub-plot ended up well too, with the aid of some amazing co-incidence!  You do usually have two or more happy endings in an operetta and that was delivered.

It was a great show with lots happening and some implausible love at first sight.  But love at first sight is a staple of operetta, of course.  There was much drama and it did get me in. I was feeling a bit teary at the end.",1439856000,2,6379,4.8351851851851855
8501617,3,B006O8K4I0,"Not the ""real"" story, I have seen the operetta several times, this ""movie"" is not what the libretto tells. Rudolf Schock is past his prime, too old for the role he plays here.",1433721600,,175,4.333333333333333
8501618,4,B006O8K4I0,"Lovely music and interesting staging.  I have to say that Ingeborg Hallstein is wasted in this role, her solos are the least of the music in this film.",1423612800,,151,4.392857142857143
8501619,5,B006O8K4I0,This is a very good version of a rarely performed operetta composed by Kalman with English subtitles of the libretto.,1386806400,,117,4.9
8501620,5,B006O8K4I0,"This must be one of the best films ever made of an operetta although Mr X should have had a better disguise- perhaps with a hat. Rudolf Schock is on fine form and Ingeborg Hallstein must be one of the best coloratura sopranos ever, with a beautiful and accurately pitched voice, at times hitting top E. All the supporting roles are well sung and played. Kalman's score is one of his finest with lots of good tunes idiomatically realized. The story revolves around the mysterious Mister X who is more than the sum of his parts and the Princess Fedora Palinska who has to come to terms with what he is rather than who he is.",1342828800,3,622,4.370689655172414
8501621,4,B006O8K4I0,"... a vindictive nobleman contrived the lovely Fedora's wedding to a circus performer, unaware that this was the man who had loved her before her first marriage. Since this is an operetta, we know all will end happily, but it takes three acts and assorted musical numbers to get us there. This 1969 film (one of a series made for television) opens out the settings--the circus scenes have live animals--and the final trapeze stunt is very nicely managed. Rudolf Schock, in his middle fifties here, doesn't look bad with the much younger Ingeborg Hallstein. Both are low-key performers, which is preferable to the mugging and overplaying that afflicts some operetta performances. (The comics are a little broader.) The vocal numbers have quite obviously been recorded separately, but the dubbing is mostly good. Clear subtitles make everything easy to follow. No extras on the disc, but a nice booklet. I hope Lehar's Giuditta is on their list of upcoming titles...",1336262400,7,964,5.069182389937107
8501622,3,B006O8K4I0,"Although Kalman's 1924 COUNTESS MARITZA is still staged today in English-speaking countries, his 1926 CIRCUS PRINCESS is apparently not produced in these countries, hence available primarily through this recently released DVD with English subtitles. An unusual tale of a Prince, who joins a circus after being disowned for proposing to the wrong Princess, this is a  1973 film made for German television by dubbing a studio recording sound track acted during panning long shots and then edited into the movie. Despite a clumsy editing job, it is worth seeing superstars Ingeborg Hallstein as the jilted Princess who accidentally finds him in the circus, and Rudolf Schock as the protagonist Prince. The film may hold little interest to a general audience not familiar with these star names and not operetta groupies.",1332460800,8,816,5.276923076923077
