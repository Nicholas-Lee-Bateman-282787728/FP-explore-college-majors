8691082,4,B00QEIXYSC,"What's not to like about a series featuring a dashing young vicar and a wily police inspector who pair up to investigate a series of crimes? Set in the 1950s, this series provides some classic detective stories while lightly observing the class distinctions and social challenges facing post-war Britain. It's first-class entertainment and Canon Sydney Chambers (played by the devilishly handsome James Norton), is set to become one of the great fictional detectives.  For even more fun, read the original novels by James Runcie.",1422489600,,529,5.2976190476190474
