6257074,5,B00ICS8X6K,I have loved the music for years enjoyed the movies but this DVD ranks as my best experience of Pink Floyd ever. Maybe there are fans of the early Floyd that disagree but do not let that discourage you from at the very least seeing this DVD. Often times I show my own copy to friends and they are totally in awe of the raw musical power of this video. The three women singers are so in to the music and the camera angles and floating cameras make this really cool for its time....My rating is a 10 out of 10,1107907200,7,507,4.02970297029703
6257075,2,B00ICS8X6K,"This DVD is a low quaility dup of the VHS version.  The audio is not very good, audio levels change without notice or reason.  The poor quaility of this DVD will encourage me to dup my current VHS to DVD for my own use.  US owners can only play this on computer DVD players or a Unverisal DVD player which most people do not own.  The content is low quaility, not the performance...Pink Floyd is outstanding as usally, but this DVD can't even pass for a second gen MP3 file...low rent folks.  It gets 2 stars because if you have never seen it, it still might be worth $10.00 if you can find a copy at that price.",1118275200,12,612,4.1525423728813555

6257082,5,B00ICS8X6K,"Pink Floyd's second concert video entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder was released in June of 1989(the satellite album was released in November of 1988). The album(and video) was recorded and filmed over five nights at the Nassau Coliseum in New York in August of 1988(the end of the regular Momentary Lapse tour '87-'88 and directed by video director Wayne Isham(Bon Jovi, Rolling Stones, Queensryche, etc.). The band would tour Europe again in 1989/90 in support of Delicate Sound with the tour called Another Lapse). The band first attempted to record a live album and video in November of 1987 in Atlanta but the band were not up to par. Subsequently, they tried again in the summer of 1988. As a result, a great live album and video. The album has superb live versions of On The Turning Away and One of These Days. The fans' much reviled track The Dogs of War is superior to its studio counterpart with Nick Mason playing drums this time and Rick Wright playing on keyboards like he did in the old days(the two are the only two original Floyd members who did every tour) and of course David Gilmour's vocals and superb guitar work. The film on this track is breath taking with the German Shepard dogs running with the yellow eyes as if they were possessed by Satan himself. Other standouts are Wish You Were Here and Learning To Fly. Some tracks are slightly edited like Shine on You Crazy Diamond and Comfortably Numb. The video features material not on the album like Signs Of Life, On the Run, a spellbinding The Great Gig in the Sky and of course the superb One Slip. Money was available on the US video version of Delicate Sound but not the UK edition. This video is unfortunately now out-of-print. The video did well for a live concert video as it went Multi-Platinum and is a great document of Floyd's reunion tour.

 Highly recommended!",1113868800,7,1848,4.648318042813456
6257083,3,B00ICS8X6K,"If this DVD is made from the VHS version then I am disappointed.  As I said in my review of the VHS version, the problem is that it is only 90 minutes of the show.  I was at this concert in Nassau Long Island.  A good 45 minutes is left out of the show and the beginning is only the last few minutes of Shine On You Crazy Diamonds.  But my biggest gripe is the special effects that distract you from enjoying the concert.  The slow motion effect is annoying plus it takes away the feeling that you are watching a concert.  If this is to simulate the effect of drugs while watching then it sucks.  To Gilmour and McCartney take a note from Waters, Styx, the Eagles and many other acts, just give us the damn show and cut out all the special effects and cut aways from the show.  If you want a great Pink Floyd DVD then get Roger Waters In the Flesh Live, at least you see the whole concert and his band plays to perfection.  I was hoping that when this DVD came out they would go back to original film of the concert and present it the way it was which was a great concert.  There is no need to distract us with special effects, let the druggies get their special effects the old fashioned way.",1112400000,13,1193,4.103448275862069
6257084,5,B00ICS8X6K,This is a must have. It really shows why people all over the world regard Pink Floyd as a magical group. I've owned this film on VHS for many years and now I have it on DVD.It's a beautiful piece of history and a treasure to any Pink Floyd and David Gilmore fan. Highly recommend to anyone!!!!,1107907200,11,293,4.157894736842105

Excellent on the visual and excellent on the sound (true rendition of 5 in 1 dolby digital surround. I am enjoying it to a tee and glad i decided to invest in it. Historical for my collection and although i did not see the actual show and wouldn't be able to comment whether complete, it makes for a unique experience in the absence of whatever 'official release' would stand for.
