Dobbs."" There are many negative reviews of the film that are just plain ridiculous, I'm going to try to put them in perspective. I'll try not to give away too many SPOILERS, but it can't be totally helped......

1. ""(it's) dull. There's so many scenes of characters just sitting around and talking..."" Yes there are scenes of people talking to each other, some in Spanish. Even if their conversations are mundane they're in benefit to the plot and characters. If you find Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, the films of Quentin Tarantino or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Dinner-With-Andre/dp/6305069743/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Dinner With Andre</a>&nbsp;boring, then stick to action blockbusters......

2. ""(There's a) sensitive rapist, who gets his feelings hurt and walks away from his victim only to have her walk after him and ask him to make love to her."" There's a scene where Benny and his girlfriend Elita, who earlier in the film was shown to be a working prostitute, are camping for the night. This happens after a tender scene where he asks her to marry him which makes her very happy. Two bikers then come along, one decides to take her in the woods to rape her, while the other holds Benny at gunpoint (played by cult musician&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Fritts/dp/B0015ATC30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Fritts</a>) who then taunts him by singing a lascivious rendition of the old blues standard ""Jelly Jelly."" She goes willingly figuring it's better to submit than have themselves killed. The rapist becomes impotent because she shows no fear and walks away, takes out his gun and sits down, as if deep in thought. She thinks he's deciding to killing them, so she says ""No, don't"" and starts to seduce him to keep anything bad from happening. The point becomes moot when her boyfriend gets the drop on the bad guys......

3. ""...all Peckinpah spends his time doing is figuring out different ways to disrobe the female lead..."" The lead actress (Isela Vega, who's great, btw) is shown topless twice in the whole picture, for a minute or two when she's in bed with her boyfriend and for a couple minutes after the rapist tears off her shirt. The rest of the time she's clothed......

4. ""... if you watch this film, you'll see why Peckinpah had the final cut taken away from him on ALL (my highlight) his other films..."" First of all, this film hasn't an ounce of ""fat,"" every scene forwards the plot, and there are no continuity problems like the ones found in the arguably TWO films that were ""taken away from him.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Major-Dundee/dp/B00CBWSQZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Major Dundee</a>&nbsp;was the only film actually taken away from him,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pat-Garrett-and-Billy-the-Kid/dp/B000BT96DC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</a>&nbsp;was butchered by the studio head after Peckinpah completed the film as revenge. Peckinpah's cut has been available for a long time and is considered one of his best films......

5. ""...Benny decides that the hooker is worth killing for when the fact remains that she is just a hooker..."" It's obvious from the get go that Benny and Elita, a third-rate musician and a hooker, are on the losing end of a town for losers. When Benny figures he can make enough money for both of them to leave he greedily takes the chance so they can get out of the life they're living. Because he loves a hooker she doesn't deserve his love? It's obvious that Benny loves her and while not to happy about her other affairs, he accepts her as she is. It's also implied that they never had an exclusive agreement between them until he asks her to marry him. I'd love to hear this person's opinion on minorities and gays. Self-righteous twaddle, you deserve to be homeless for a while to learn empathy......

6. ""...the same, routine Sam Peckinpah film, filled with lots of blood, guts, bullets and slow-motion action...but will satisfy those who enjoy ultra-violence in their movies..."" I didn't catch the so-called ""guts,"" but there is violence, some of it slo-mo. In all of the film's 112 minute running time there is about ten minutes of violence, tops. As for the slo-mo, didn't people ever hear the saying ""what took seconds seemed like hours?"" I feel that Peckinpah uses slo-mo to depict how you would feel if you were in the same situation, you'd be asking yourself ""is this ever going to end?""

7. ""...another nihilistic film from Sam Peckinpah..."" OK, once more, Benny loves Elita. He's found a chance for them to get out of their miserable lives and be happy. Bad things happen to them and his dreams are over. He decides to punish those who took away his dream. Nihilism is ""a doctrine holding that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated."" Benny doesn't do what he does in the film for nothing. Standing up for your principles and being true to yourself whether right or wrong is the main theme running through almost all of Peckinpah's films, not nihilism......

I'm not a Sam Peckinpah apologist. He made a few films that I thought were just OK ('The Getaway,' 'Junior Bonner') and a stinker or two ('The Killer Elite,' 'Convoy') but I'm surprised at some of 'Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia's' reviews. They make me wonder if I was watching the same movie, or if the reviewers had even watched the film. Maybe they caught a truncated or censored version on TV with commercials. After some reviews that I read, when I first watched it I expected to see a crazed Warren Oates with a bevy of topless women driving around with a rotting head in his car, covered in blood and  mowing down everyone in his path. He does ride with the head for a very short while, with it becoming his Yorick. There's never anything exploitive about it, they never even show it's removal. The head is actually a stand in for Benny's shattered dreams, dreams cut off with no chance of returning. Benny's rampage is to cause those responsible to suffer the same fate. 'Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia"" tells the universal story of people's dreams and length they'll go to make them come true, it's by turn dramatic and comic, but mostly heart-wrenching and heartbreaking. Warren Oates gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Benny. Forget the reviews, 'Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia' is an example of a filmmaker at his prime. Watch it with an open mind, you won't be disappointed......

One last thought, the hotel room where Benny goes to see the cronies of the kingpin ordering the hit on Alfredo immediately reminded me of the scenes with Dean Stockwell at the ""This Is It"" club in 'Blue Velvet.' I wonder if David Lynch was inspired by it, even subconsciously......",1399852800,20,8127,5.681481481481481
