8556167,5,B00AQ6YZV8,"Wife To Be Sacrificed is the best filmed Japanese BDSM erotica I have ever seen. It also hits several other taboo subjects quite hard. It is beautiful and disturbing. There is no comedic relief. The gorgeous Naomi Tani is absolute perfection. This film is not for everyone. It is dark and touches on some very uncomfortable subjects besides the main BDSM storyline. Having said that, there are very few quality films with an actual storyline dealing with BDSM. This is the best I have ever seen. The quality of the look and feel, is that of a big budget film. As with my review of Flower & Snake '74, this is worth having- even if just for Naomi Tani. The viewing quality of the Kino DVD is excellent.",1396915200,3,701,4.484375
