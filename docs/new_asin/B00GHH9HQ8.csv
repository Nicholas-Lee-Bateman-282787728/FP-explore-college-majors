6076022,5,B00GHH9HQ8,One of the best Sci Fi shows I have seen besides Battlestar. Great buy! I own the original Blu ray box set. Anyone know if this is in widescreen?,1437609600,,145,4.0344827586206895

6076025,4,B00GHH9HQ8,I loved this series when it first came out and I am happy that they released the 15th Anniversary Edition. I think some of my favorite episodes are in season 2 and I love the extras and the interviews on the dvds.  The only negative I would have to say is that there are no subtitles.,1426809600,,284,4.071428571428571

6076027,5,B00GHH9HQ8,"Fantastic show that reminds me a little bit of Firefly but much more alien mix to the crew as well as the enemies and inhabitants of the worlds. They do change a few common words such as Hour=Arn, Minute=Microt, and ill let you figure out frell. All in all I really love this show and it's characters.",1414022400,,301,4.298245614035087

6076029,5,B00GHH9HQ8,"I was one of the ones that stopped watching the SciFi Channel when Farscape was cancelled. Since then, don't even remember how many years ago that was, I have only watched The Peacekeeper Wars on SciFi when it originally aired and nothing else. Since I own the entire series and the movie, I guess you could say I am a fan(atic) regarding Farscape.

It's a good buy, but be sure to open the case immediately to make sure all of the discs are there. 'Nuff said, I think.",1407974400,2,469,4.329545454545454
