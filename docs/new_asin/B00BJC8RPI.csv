5634963,5,B00BJC8RPI,"Wow! Melanie Griffith .. so cool as she can be in this fun film into the future to help a businessman  to go to the ends of the earth to find  a replacement for his Cherry 2000 android wife that broke down. Great fun to watch Melanie as a renegade tracker who must find E. Johnson to find  the exact android  duplicate. The second film is worth watching also with Melanie Griffith,  but also in film is Tommy Lee Jones and Sting .. it's about a corrupt American businessman and so much more and takes place in New Castle, England .. this is a very fine film. Good acting from all. Twice the is the fun of a sweet looking Melanie Griffith in the films, ""Cherry 2000"" and ""Stormy Monday"". Great 2DVD Set.",1381276800,3,702,4.2481203007518795

5634980,4,B00BJC8RPI,"Cherry 2000 is nuts. You just have to have a sense of humor, laugh at the 80's, and wonder at the oddness of it all. I like the movie for its goofiness, but I love the mustang. Where can I get a car like that?",1423785600,,209,3.6666666666666665

5635000,5,B00BJC8RPI,Cherry 2000 has always been a favorite. Expensive DVD except with this Amazon exclusive. Twice the movies / 1/2 the price. Great deal and good quality DVD. Would recommend it.,1404000000,,175,4.866666666666666

5635002,4,B00BJC8RPI,"I have long loved Cherry 2000, and to get it with a bonus was a nice extra. The bonus is good, although not as good as the classic sci-fi movie it comes with, so the overall ranking is four stars. But I am glad to have at last Cherry 2000 in my library. Well worth buying.",1401408000,,272,3.875
5635003,4,B00BJC8RPI,We bought it for Cherry 2000. We had it on VHS and wanted to replace it with a DVD. Stormy Monday was a bonus. it is not real good but so so.,1395964800,2,141,3.4375
5635004,5,B00BJC8RPI,This is a Killer Movie. If you watched back in the 80's you'll Love to see it again and for the price you can't go wrong.,1395964800,,121,3.6923076923076925
5635005,5,B00BJC8RPI,For me this was the best sci-fi in the 80's and very hard to find and then amazon put it on a double feature and I had to have the movie and it's just as I remembered 20 years ago. They don't make movies like this anymore.,1395446400,,222,3.74468085106383

5635007,4,B00BJC8RPI,"I just like Melanie Griffith - Cherry 2000 is a classic bone-head sci-fi action comedy without too much of the typical liberal garbage in it/ Stormy Monday had a look and a hook, just not as bright or sharp as it could've been.",1391731200,,227,4.3023255813953485

8569501,5,B00BJC8RPI,"Its a oldie but a goodie,, saw it years back, and them I said I wanted to see it again, for me worth the watch, and great acting and special special stunts, I am sure it will bring back some memories.",1507593600,,200,3.902439024390244
8569502,3,B00BJC8RPI,An oldie but I remembered it from my past.  It's kind of funny now.  Melanie Griffith does a great job in her early days,1494460800,,120,3.9583333333333335
8569503,5,B00BJC8RPI,I love Melanie Griffith. The most corny sci-fi movie that is still great. Allegedly takes place in 2017.  Good comparison to present day (teasing).,1494460800,,147,5.125
8569504,5,B00BJC8RPI,This was totally the best gift I could have given my husband.  Good quality and shipped in decent time frame.  My husband's brother plays in the background in this movie in the bar scene.  Awesome!,1485734400,,197,4.571428571428571
8569505,4,B00BJC8RPI,"I saw Cherry 2000 way back in 1987 when it came out and the idea of a robotic ""companion"" was not yet common (as it seems to be these days). I  never forgot the (often cheesy) story and had to have a copy when I came across it a few months ago. (Stormy Monday was also a pretty good film as well). Definitely worth the price.",1483574400,,325,3.9242424242424243
