8736486,3,B016IN3GOO,"This is a story steep with symbolism and criticism of religion. It made my head hurt trying to figure out the point to this whole mess which seems to be pointless and various in it messages. Marius is a child who lives in Heaven, a cult community who worship Caine. Marius has a friend Eden and is taught by Mr. Apple. A talking kitten convinces our two children to pass through a whole in the wall, a forbidden act, because an evil female lives there, If it sounds a lot like Genesis. The black birds are also involved as is sex and sexual symbolism. It made my head hurt sober. Might work as the third feature in a Fritz the Cat film festival.

Guide: F-word, sex, nudity. An animated film most people will love or hate.",1469491200,,722,4.3088235294117645
8736487,1,B016IN3GOO,"That's horrible.  This movie feeds no life at all.  I don't want to watch that movie.  I don't want to watch anything that
pollutes and feeds death to my spirit. I would have a horrible heaviness watching this movie. This movie was made by
satanists.  Watching stuff like this, all this does is cause agitation and wounds your eternal spirit and releases demons
which will oppress you and attack your physical body, mind and spirit. It also puts a lot of demonic, negative imagery into you mind that the devil will use to attack you.  You people are making yourselves sitting ducks by exposing yourselves to this death.  Why don't you watch a good movie  like ""The Gospel of John"" or ""King Of Kings"" instead to feed life to your soul rather than death?&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gospel-of-John-Visual-Bible-2-DVD-set/dp/B000FBHFL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gospel of John - Visual Bible - 2-DVD set</a>",1464480000,4,960,5.534246575342466

There's no other like it. If you're looking for a flick that's easy to understand and reminds you of other movies, this is not it. Plain and simple, this is something different all together. Don't watch with mainstream people. They'll either run away screaming or try to have you committed.",1459814400,2,459,4.974025974025974

8736490,5,B016IN3GOO,"I bought the DVD of this movie so this isn't a review about Amazons streaming version. That said, I purchase this movie so that the writer/director Jimmy Screamerclauz could have more money to buy whatever s*** he takes in order to keep making his art (I even bought the T shirt for this film). Having been a fan since seeing ""Where the Dead GO to Die"", and ""Reality Bleed-Through""--a DVD which came with a custom story written on the interior DVD cover-I am convinced that Jimmy is doing this because he loves it and he isn't trying to become the next Michael Bay. These are psychedelic, seizure-inducing videos that always push the limits of taste--and to me that's a good thing creatively. It's not shock just for shock value--it's more like over-the -top gore the likes of which are nothing compared to a Mexican Cartel video. So it's all in good fun.
So, for being a one-man-show, I salute Jimmy's efforts to produce and interact with his dedicated fan base -- which can involve having people send him selfies so he can animate them and then kill them in a music video (would Michael Bay do that?).
Underground animation/film making at it's demented finest. Keep up the good work.",1458604800,4,1185,4.6746411483253585

Review- There is no art without risk. I remember a teacher telling me that in college and that sentence pretty much sums up what I feel about the art house film. I love a film to be daring, bold and yet expressive in its own language that the mainstream may dismiss but true fans will embrace. Jimmy ScreamerClauze dances to a song that is so twisted only very few people can relate to the tune. The notion of Heaven not being this impossible utopia that only chosen strive for, but actually a town that looks it could be easily obtained. We meet Caine who some may think of some kind of leader as he seems to oversee his people and provides them with what they need. The people only have one rule, that rule being do not communicate with  The Evil One. The Evil One is beyond the walls of Heaven and people are constantly keeping guard to make sure no one goes past the wall. Some may see the wall as being a symbol of the middle of your brain trying to separate (and not be manipulated by) the two sides being the left and right or good and bad. We meet a child named Marius who one day plays near the wall and sees this cat with a broken leg. The young boy wants to save the cat so he crosses into the forbidden side. In his attempt to save this cat he and his classmate Eden soon falls down this hole and starts to see the truth about this world. This film delves into the young ambition all of us have as children and some as adults as to wanting to know what lies on the other side of things. This film also opens the debate about how easily manipulated we are to believe what we are told. As we watch the truth start to emerge about Heaven and Caine, the things that Caine hides.

Like Jimmys previous work, the thought put into this animated film is very deep. This film deals heavily in many topics one being isolation, and among many others is the perception of Utopia. Sometimes Utopia can be a cleverly hidden Dystopia. Devanney Pinn really shines in the voice over of  The Evil One. To watch the bonus features and see her truly get into the character really gives you an appreciation for the effort she gave. While, I really loved Where the Dead Go to Die a little bit more, this film was a good follow up. I found the animation at times to be a little exhausting, and I felt maybe this film could have been trimmed maybe 10 minutes. The positives to this film, I feel the voice over work by all involved showed passion and dedication. I loved the concept of this film, it leads for so many different perspectives. I feel two people can watch this film together and both come up with a different feeling and meaning to what they are watching. The manipulation of the story is really deeply thought out and would pervert the mind. This is clearly a movie to do drugs with. If you have any kind of heavy party favor at the house, either shoot it, snort it or drink it before turning this film on. I can picture the paranoia of doing acid while watching this film and assuming this is the future as told to us by a CNN hijacked PTL radical club. For what this film was",1454716800,2,3101,4.259762308998302
