8540552,5,B009EC2MCE,I was so happy to see a documentary on the Motion Picture Studio at BYU.  I worked there for three years in the late 1970's and I loved it.  It was nice to see people I used to work with.  The movie was very well done and a great tribute to Judge and Scott Whitaker.  Thanks -,1380758400,2,276,3.789473684210526
8540553,4,B009EC2MCE,"It took a long time for someone to tell the full story of the beginning of motion picture making at BYU. As an actor, who was in one of the first full length movies made by director Wetzel (Judge) Whitaker and his scriptwriting younger brother Scottie, I had an opportunity to see up close their movie making skills and abilities. All of these are ably represented in this film which utilizes clips from many early LDS films and as described by many of the best LDS film makers of today who share their knowledge and the legacy of the Whitaker Brothers, who left Walt Disney to create at Brigham Young University a whole new film genre...LDS movies:  Movies that are especially attractive to members and friends of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Between them they had the perfect set of talents to do what LDS Church President David O. McKay and BYU wanted someone to do...make movies that had strong morals, great scripts and outstanding acting.  Movies that told the story of the LDS Church, its principals and teachings in a way that anyone could understand and appreciate.

I won't say that the earliest movies were perfect. The film I was in ""How Near to the Angels"" is definitely laugh provoking today when shown to our youth, who have seen much more sophisticated LDS films.  But it was a start and ""A Reel Legacy"" shows how that start grew into the award winning movies of later years and then continued into the modern world of commercial LDS films.

For these reasons, I believe this film rates at least Four Stars.",1356652800,2,1544,4.637362637362638

It was a highlight for us, and I purchased copies for my children.  Their grandfather was a remarkable person.",1354492800,4,278,4.52
