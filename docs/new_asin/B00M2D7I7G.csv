6554046,4,B00M2D7I7G,"""The Grand Seduction"" (2014 release from Canada; 115 min.) brings the story of a small fisher town/harbor in Tickle Head, Newfoundland. As the movie opens, a voice-over narrates of the good times ""back in the day"" when the men were fishermen and provided for their families. The young boy we see in those scenes is Murray, and as the movie transitions to the present, Murray, now a grown man (played by Brendan Gleeson), and the rest of the village, is struggling economically (they are all on welfare). In order to secure a petrochemical recycling plant (and the badly needed jobs), the town must bring in a resident doctor. In a parallel story line, we meet Dr. Lewis (played by Taylor Kitsch), a cricket-obsessed plastic surgeon who is busted at the airport for cocaine possession. In a plea deal, he agrees to go to Tickle Head for 30 days. The harbor village decides they must go all-out and seduce the doctor so as to convince him to remain there long term. Will the doctor be charmed and decide to stay? Will Tickle Head get that plant? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is a remake of the French-Canadian movie ""La Grande Seduction"" of some 10 years ago. I have not seen the original but from reading up on ""Le Grand Seduction"", the remake sticks very close to the original, at least story-wise. More importantly, the movie immediately reminded me of that other ""small harbor must charm newcomer"" movie from Scotland, ""Local Hero"" (1983 release), one of the best 'little' movies you'll see in your life time, period. ""The Grand Seduction"" also has its charms, but not nearly as perfectly done as in ""Local Hero"". The acting performances are fine. I feared the worst seeing Taylor Kitsch's name in the cast, but it turns out he gives a restrained performance. Brendan Gleeson oozes charm from start to finish, in his own rough and tumble way. The musical score (by Francois-Pierre Lue and Maxime Barzel) is very pleasant as well, but there again it feels at times almost lifted from (ex-Dire Straits) Mark Knopfler's sublime score for ""Local Hero"".

""The Grand Seduction"" opened without any pre-release hype or fanfare at my local art-house theatre this past weekend here in Cincinnati. The matinee screening I saw this at was PACKED, to my big surprise (and heavily leaning towards seniors, I might add). The audience LOVED this movie, laughing out loud on many occasions and simply eating it up. Bottom line: this is a pleasant, if unoriginal, movie that aims to charm from start to finish, and if you are in the mood for a non-challenging but feel-good movie, this is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1406678400,10,2748,4.758909853249476

6554051,4,B00M2D7I7G,"This movie is more of a fun experience. It's the kind of movie you can watch for the characters, story, beautiful setting, and yes even some thoughtful themes. I found myself thinking about the question, ""What does it mean to live in a community where people know who you are, and even care about your life?"" You have to wonder if this is even possible these days. This may sound dated in modern culture. But isn't that the point? What are we losing when we give up community to pursue modern lifestyles? Should we care? Brendan as the Mayor struggling to help his community survive seems somehow authentic. Which is another theme raised by the whole dishonest plan to seduce the young doctor to stay and help the community. Watch, relax, enjoy, and think about why we all need to be part of some kind of community.",1481500800,,815,4.551020408163265

6554069,5,B00M2D7I7G,"Surprisingly entertaining, reminded me of Saving Ned Devine.

In the same vein as quirky comedy Ned Devine you have a small hamlet filled with quirky people trying to fool someone into helping them out. My wife and I watched this on our honeymoon and really enjoyed it. Every time I left the room to do something I could hear her laughing.

I highly suggest this movie for a romantic comedy night for any couple, and it is pretty much safe for the whole family. Very, very enjoyable.",1455235200,,483,4.540229885057471
6554070,4,B00M2D7I7G,"The town of Tickle Head used to be thriving fishing port on the coast of Newfoundland. Then the Cod dried up and the town fell on hard times. We join them at a time when everyone is on Welfare and the civic pride has ebbed from the small community like the fish stocks that once sustained them.

Then a petro chemical company turns up willing to build a reprocessing plant on the coast  their bid is in with a chance. They like the community but they must have a resident doctor which they do not have and with a small community are unlikely to get one. Brendan Gleeson plays Murray French erstwhile fisherman and now  by default  the Mayor and they think all is lost when fate deals them a one off chance. A plastic surgeon gets sent to the community as a way to avoid awkward questions by the law. The community decide to do a charm offensive in order to persuade this man that their little community is heaven. Problem is he loves cricket, jazz (and they dont) and he has a life he is already missing. Can the plan ever work?

Now this is a gentle comedy and the laughs are more smiles than guffaws. However, the film has a warmth and charm that makes you want to watch it. Taylor Kitsch is nice, charming and plays the part to a tee but Gleeson as ever is the scene stealer though he is ably aided in this respect from a supporting cast that all do a fine job. If you like your humour on the slow side but don't mind a tale from left field then I think there is a lot here to enjoy.",1454976000,,1486,4.145833333333333

With little else we hadn't already done aboard the ship at the midway point of our journey, we decided to duck in the theater (along with a HUGE amount of other passengers, no surprise there) and catch this movie for lack of better things and very glad we did! Comedy was complete with plenty of quirky characters, amusing dialogue, and a humorous plot that left us and seemingly everyone else around us in stitches. Mind you, it's probably meant for an older audiece (age 40+ which comprised the bulk of our fellow shipmates) but ia also good for younger folks, too, as it didn't rely on the vulgarity so common in what goes for comedies these days.

Kitsch notwithstanding a movie about creating employment opportunities for a remote community certainly was an employment opportunity for a parcel of Newfoundland Actors, seems only fitting. If theres a Newfoundland clich that gets missed I didn't detect it. However you will look in vain for the famous recreation of the publicity shot of the three stooges with the gaping cod fish.

It's also a rare comedy in that it is verrrryyyy ambivalent about its characters and situations. With one notable exception, NOBODY in this movie is ""clean"" (or what we used to call an ""upstanding citizen."")  They make questionable decisions, do very questionable things. In fact, the entire premise of the movie--what a little Canadian maritime Canadian community will do to keep a doctor and bring some employment to its less-than-200 citizens--is very, very questionable, indeed.

And watch two things, especially: the postmistress and that $100,000 in cash in the zipper bag.

So, its more than a mere comedy (although 2 of 3 stars for the laughs alone.)  What gives it the three-star rating is the ""other stuff.""

6554113,3,B00M2D7I7G,"This 'fish out of water' type tale has been done before so the viewer isn't interested in the destination. He pretty much knows where this is all going. He just wants to enjoy the ride. I won't be taking this trip again any time soon.

Here's the scoop. A tine fishing harbor in Nova Scotia is on its heels. Fishing has dried up an all the residents are on welfare. They want to entice a petroleum company to build a repurposing plant there and put the harbor back to work. The catch is they need to show they have a full time doctor in residence. Dr. Lewis (Taylor Kitch) gets nabbed with cocaine at the airport but the quick thinking customs agent grabs the opportunity to press the doctor into service for one month. Now the town needs to seduce him to make this place his home.

This is an Okay endeavor. It's sort of like ""local Hero"" meets ""Doc Martin"" meets ""Northern Exposure."" So you need the quaint, homey, eccentric harbor folk with one or two who seem a bit more worldly. In this case it's the female postmaster and Brendan Gleeson. They listen in on his phone calls (squirm) to see what he likes, doesn't like or general vulnerabilities so they know what to do to make things comfy for him. The entire town is in on the ruse but the viewer knows this will have to fall apart. So will they be able to recover?

Taylor Kitch is a likeable sort but it takes him way too long to catch on to things. Brendan Gleeson is as good as I've ever seen him. Here he plays sort of the town father who has concocted the scam. He looks and sounds the part. The rest of the town is shown in various degrees of character depth, but, as I said, they're a goofy, warm lot. You like these folk. The harbor is a bit run down but it does have a certain idyllic quality to it. The music, with more than a bit of a Celtic twist, might be the best thing going. Some of the plot points and dialogue get pretty clunky but you hang in there to see how it will all turn out.

6554140,3,B00M2D7I7G,"This was a good premise for a plot, reading the cover before watching I was immediately reminded of the old Michael J Fox Doc Hollywood movie. This one wasn't as much fun as that one, it lacks a big name star of course but plot wise it had it moments, such as the town in the bar pretending they're really interested in the most boring sport on the planet, because the doctor was a big cricket fan, then quickly changing the channel when he went to the bathroom for a few moments of relief. But overall the humour was few and far between lots of drawn out footage of the locals and scenery (nice scenery mind you). The main unofficial town leader immediately was dislikeable when you learn he is committing fraud claiming and cashing a welfare check of a dead man as well as his own. It would have been better to follow him on screen if he was an honest guy simply trying to save the future of his island.

The plot like Doc Hollywood did, stretches plausibility a fair bit. Common sense for the corrupt Customs agent would have been to simply blackmail him to move to the island and tell the factory developers he loved it there and was going to live there forever. Or more sense would have simply been to pay him a fair bit more than he would normally make to move and set up a clinic, and practice for a year or so and not mention he's only there temporarily.",1417737600,,1362,4.27906976744186

The doctor who finds the local people so different from those he has known so far in his life, people who really care about each other and their community, and he feels drawn to them.

Your second reaction is the film has a decidedly Irish lilt to it enhanced by star Brendan Gleeson's thick as molasses brogue and the fiddles in the music score.  You think you're in the Emerald Isle though some of the characters have touch-and-go brogues and make reference to Ottawa and ice hockey.  Regardless, you eventually let your guard down and succumb to the film's eminent charms though it virtually screams out its derivative nature.  Gleeson is an imposing presence and practically bear hugs the audience into having a good time and ignore their naysaying impulses and allow themselves to chuckle in submission.  You'll probably find yourself laughing hysterically even if you've heard the joke before.  Story is by Ken Scott who is adapting here his earlier French-Canadian film,""La Grande Seduction"".

It was nice to see this film in a big theatre and the DVD in the local rental stores as sometimes these quirky Canadian films get lost in the shuffle of huge budget American movies.

6554190,5,B00M2D7I7G,"Take a small Canadian fishing village that is no longer allowed to catch enough fish to support its families (shades of ""Local Hero"" in 1983); add a petrochemical company looking to locate a new recycling plant; include their stipulation that any town where they build MUST have a doctor; NOW the plot begins to thicken...

The residents are on the dole and they feel humiliated and demeaned. As we watched this delightful Canadian entry to the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival we knew that this would have a happy ending, we would get to know these quirky folks and we would have a whole armload of people to root for. We just didn't know exactly how we would arrive at this happy ending.

Director Don McKellar brings us:
  * Brendan Gleeson (""The Guard"") is the lead conniver. Watch him call his first town meeting! He talks the entire population into his charade as they blackmail a young doctor into a temporary gig during which they hope to seduce him into staying. He also sets up an illegal telephone monitor so they know what sort of impression they are making on the doctor.
  * Taylor Kitsch (""Lone Survivor"") is that young doctor, caught with a bit of cocaine at an airport and blackmailed by the former mayor of Tickle Cove to go there for awhile. Gleeson's character reassures him, to his dismay, that the town is ""cocaine friendly.""
  * Gordon Pinsent (""Due South"") is our conniver's best friend. He is game for anything...even trying to pretend he can play cricket! His wife is one of the women who listens in on our doctor's phone calls.
  * Liane Balaban (""Saving Hope"") is a lovely young woman our conniver would like to throw into the mix as bait for our studly young doctor. She has heard he is engaged so will have nothing to do with it.
  * Mark Critch (Lots of TV) is the lowly banker in this hamlet, afraid he will be replaced by an ATM.

It's so much fun to watch the two older gals whose job it is to listen in on the doctor's phone calls. Of course, anything he says becomes common knowledge by morning, but he never tumbles.

Other than Mr. Gleeson, who is from Dublin, the director, writers and cast are all Canadian. I love it! This PG-13 film has no gunshots, fisticuffs, vehicular mayhem or blowie uppie stuff. Just lots of resourceful people trying to fool a fairly gullible young man and a good time is had by all. My DVD from Amazon will have closed captions!",1413590400,,2403,4.532407407407407

6554200,4,B00M2D7I7G,"Directed by Don McKellar (Sensitive Skin, Last Night) from a screenplay by Michael Dowse and Ken Scott, The Grand Seduction is actually an English-language re-make of a 2004 French-Canadian film La Grande Seduction (English title - The Seduction of Dr. Lewis).

The Canadian island community of Tickle Head was once a prosperous fishing village as we see at the beginning of the film in a flashback to the way things were when every morning the fishermen would get up early and go out to the boats carrying lanterns to begin the day's fishing, seen through the eyes of a young boy.  But then we flash forward to the current day, where the fishing is long gone and now instead of going out to the boats, the people trudge off to the town's post office pick up their welfare checks from Kathleen (Liane Balaban), the post office clerk, and then to the town bank to cash them with bank branch manager Henry Tilley (Mark Critch). Among those going through this spiritless routine is Murray French (Brendan Gleeson), who was the boy in the flashback, now a middle-aged man faced with how dismal things in Tickle Head have become. Particularly now that his wife (Cathy Jones) is leaving to take a job in St. John's on the mainland.

The town has one chance at reviving itself:  winning a contract to have a petroleum-products recycling plant built there and bring much-needed jobs to the community.  But one of the requirements is that the town must have a full-time resident doctor, which they currently lack and have been trying unsuccessfully to get for eight years.  So the quest to find a doctor willing to come to Tickle Head - and more importantly want to stay there - is on.  How the residents of the village go about doing that is what makes up the story.

Recommended for anyone who likes a comedy about human nature and the lengths we'll go to when everything is on the line.",1412812800,3,1880,4.624624624624625

6554203,4,B00M2D7I7G,"""We have one month to convince our good doctor to sign long term."" The town of Tickle Cove is starting to collapse economically. The residents are living on welfare checks and watching everyone they love move into the big city. When they have a chance to secure a contract for a factory for the town they need to do whatever they can. The first thing they need is a doctor. Dr. Lewis (Kitsch) comes to the harbor for a month and local local mayor Murray French (Gleeson) enlists the help of the town to do anything that will make him stay. I have liked pretty much anything that Brendan Gleeson has done. This one is no exception. One of the biggest pet peeves I have about movies is when they're too predictable. Almost from the beginning you are able to tell what will happen and how the movie will end. This is one of the few exceptions where that doesn't hurt the enjoyment of the movie. The writing and comedy is what keeps you watching and laughing the whole way through. It's very entertaining watching the lengths the towns people go to to impress the doctor. The stuff with cricket is my favorite. This is a movie that may not be for everyone but I liked it and I recommend it. Overall, a movie that is very predictable but for once that doesn't hurt the movie. I recommend this but again it's not really for everyone. I give it a B+.",1412380800,4,1343,4.354581673306773

6554206,4,B00M2D7I7G,"Tickle Head was once a proud fishing community that now draws government welfare checks. A factory is interested in the location, but there is one problem. They require a full time resident doctor. Taylor Kitsch plays the role of this Canadian version of ""Doc Hollywood."" The young Dr. Paul Lewis was caught at the St John's airport carrying a wee bit of cocaine. In order to get out of being reported he agrees to work 30 days at the ""inbreed"" harbor...too small to be called a village which was like Ireland with hockey.

Once there, it is up to the community to do whatever it takes to make him stay there which involves a long line of deception engineered by Brendan Gleeson.

We  have seen this plot before in a number of different ways. I am a big fan of Brendan Gleeson who always seem to play a likeable quirky character.  He did not disappoint.  A comedy that made me smile and even laugh a few times.
