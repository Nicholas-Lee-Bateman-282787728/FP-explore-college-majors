6198846,3,B00HR340IG,"5 stars for Rango.  1 star for Yogi Bear.  Yogi's a stinker man.  I want the hour and a half of my life back for that one.  So yeah, you're buying this one solely for Rango.  Great flick.",1425772800,,187,3.8157894736842106

6198850,5,B00HR340IG,"Excellent value here, the BD of Rango contains both the theatrical and 5 minutes longer Directors cut and Yogi is a remake of the old TV offerings of 30 years ago and is as well done as the originals. In a dual pack this is good value, Rango is an absolutely outstanding film, one of the best animated films ever in my view.",1396396800,8,324,4.158730158730159

8634515,5,B00HR340IG,"Rango is weird and i love him.  Johnny Depp is so strange.  Yogi bear is terrible, voice is bad (sorry Dan) I couldn't do better but Yogi is hard to do, like Barney on the Flinstones.  Quality of Blu is good.  If you like weird and strange and good then this is for you.",1474848000,,270,3.9444444444444446
