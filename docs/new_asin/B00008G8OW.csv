7983676,4,B00008G8OW,"Volume 5 in KINO's SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA series features English music hall performers and could be subtitled ""in their cups.""

PROGRAM--

In A NIGHT IN THE SHOW, Charlie Chaplin recreates two of his music hall characters: an inebriated sophisticate and ""Mr. Rowdy,"" a baggy pants drunk in bristle mustache and bowler. The stageshow they attend begins with ""La Belle Weinerwurst,"" a fat belly dancer in harem togs. A lady snaker charmer creates havoc when her basket of serpents escape into the audience. ""Dot & Dash,"" two mediocre singers get bombarded with food. Rowdy pulls out the firehose on ""Mr. Nix,"" a devilish fire eater.

Next is a Chaplin snippet-- an ad libbed band conductor routine, possibly filmed at New York's Hippodrome in 1916.

THE RINK is based on a stage act called ""Skating."" Chaplin's inept waiter makes a mess of both restaurant and kitchen, then takes time off to sneak into a rollerskating rink. He displays deft skating ability, flirts with Enda Purviance and gets into a duel on wheels with Eric Campbell. Edna invites both to her skating party and hostilities escalate to include all the men there and several cops.

In LIVE WIRES AND LOVE SPARKS, Bill Smith (the Man from Nowhere) flirts with a neighbor until her husband comes home, which sets off a series of rather unfunny chases. Featuring Billie Ritchie, a comic well-established in Britain when Chaplin started out. Ritchie claimed that Charlie stole freely from him.

HE'S IN AGAIN stars Chaplin clone Billy West as a cadging restaurant patron and Oliver Hardy as the waiter who won't take ""no funds"" for an answer. To pay off his tab, West is put to work as bartender, a drag dancer named ""Beda Thara,"" and a boxer. Directed by Charley Chase, who appears as the piano player.

PIE-EYED showcases Stan Laurel, once Chaplin's understudy in Britain, as an intoxicated customer and Glen Cavender as the Firewater Club's ex-prizefighter owner. Stan dances with the boxer's wife, which earns him a well-placed punch, the man's card, and a quick exit. On the street, a kindly cop brings Stan ""home"" to the address on the card (Cavender's apartment), partially undresses him and puts him to bed.

ONLY ME has the chameleon-like Lupino Lane (another music hall star) in 24 roles! He's the drunken bon vivant attending the Palace Theater, members of the audience and band, plus the folks on stage. Lane demonstrates great juggling and acrobatic skills, plus he plays a soprano, a toe dancer in a diaphonous gown, all four actors in a short play and a strongman.

7983677,4,B00008G8OW,"The ""Charlie Chaplin Marathon"" is an inexpensive way of seeing a variety of silent comedies by Chaplin.  It includes versions of a trio of Chaplin two-reelers down for mutual, including what is arguably the best of this shorts, and a film that has the distinction of being the first attempt at a full-length comedy (albeit not by Chaplin):

""The Rink"" (Released December 4, 1916), the eighth Mutual comedy, was based on a Karno Company sketch called ""Skating"" that was written by Charlie's brother, Syd Chaplin. Chaplin was often inspired by the business of serving food and here he ends up a waiter who ends up in a rollers kating rink trying to keep upright. Of course, if you have already seen ""Modern Times"" you know that Chaplin in a virtuoso on wheels when it comes to roller skating. This time around Edna Purviance is the Girl, while Eric Campell is one of her admirers, Mr. Stout, and Henry Bergman plays both Mrs. Stout and an angry diner (you can imagine what Charlie does to make a diner angry). In terms of the slapstick, ""The Rink"" is the most creative of the Mutual two-reelers.

""The Immigrant"" (Released June 17, 1917) is the best of Chaplin's shorts as far as I am concerned. Chaplin filmed 24 hours of footage over two months to produce a 21-minute film when most two-reelers were shot in two days. When Chaplin began, filming the restaurant scene (with Campbell as the head waiter), the film was going to be about the bohemian life, but the scene was too short and he decided to make the Tramp and the young girl immigrants, creating the opening sequence on the boat and the happy ending. Starting with the simple gag of the Tramp leaning over the ship's railing turning out to be something other than what we think, ""The Immigrant"" is classic Chaplin, mixing comedy, romance, and pathos.

""Tillie's Punctured Romance"" (Released November 14, 1914) is a notable film not because of the presence of Chaplin, who is essentially out of character playing the heartless sharper instead of the loveable Tramp, but that it was the product of Max Sennet's desire to produce the first feature-length comedy in film history. Sennett had signed the famous stage comedienne Marie Dressler for a film version of her big success, ""Tillie's Nightmare."" A massive legal entanglement resulted and the film was sold to Arco for $100,000 and released as ""Tillie's Punctured Romance"" in a whole bunch of different lengths with different soundtracks. Essentially this is a burlesque of a burlesque in which the city slicker (Chaplin) leads the pretty country heiress (Dressler) astray. Sennett throws every trick he knows into directing this 1914 film and anyone familiar with the work of Chaplin or Dressler after this point will be dismayed with their performances here. Chaplin is extremely deadpan and Dressler is overly mannered (with way too much makeup on). Fortunately even his facial hair is different enough for us to convince ourselves this is not the Tramp and therefore not the real Chaplin.

""The Vagabond"" (Released July 10, 1916), third two-reeler for Mutual, has Chaplin as a street violinist who starts off passing the hat for some other street musicians but takes the donations and goes to the country.  There he rescues a girl (Purviance) who has been kidnapped by a band of gypsies.  They meet an artist (Lloyd Bacon) who paints the girl's portrait.  The girl falls in love with the artist and his painting is seen by the girl's real mother.  Campbell plays the Gypsy chieftain and Leo White is both the Old Jew and a Gypsy Woman.  This is an average Chaplin comedy on a slightly lower level than the other two Mutuals included on this DVD.",1115251200,13,3659,4.821371610845295
7983678,4,B00008G8OW,"This video brings together a trio of two-reelers that Charlie Chaplin did for the Mutual Studio during the creative twelve-month period he often called one of the most inventive, liberating, and happiest of his fabled career. At this point Chaplin was not only directing his films but had total control over cast and script as well. From the slapstick comedy of ""The Rink"" to the evocative tale of ""The Immigrant,"" these two-reelers represent the best of this short comdies.

""The Rink"" (Released December 4, 1916), the eighth Mutual comedy, was based on a Karno Company sketch called ""Skating"" that was written by Charlie's brother, Syd Chaplin.  Chaplin was often inspired by the business of serving food and here he ends up a waiter who ends up in a rollerskating rink trying to keep upright.  Of course, if you have aleady seen ""Modern Times"" you know that Chaplin in a vertuoso on wheels when it comes to rollerskating.  This time around Edna Purviance is the Girl, while Eric Campell is one of her admirers, Mr. Stout, and Henry Bergman plays both Mrs. Stout and an angry diner (you can imagine what Charlie does to make a diner angry).  In terms of the slapstick, ""The Rink"" is the most creative of the Mutual two-reelers.

His seventh Mutual comedy, ""Behind the Screen"" (Released November 13, 1916) is noteworthy because it provides a look behind the scenes at a Hollywood movie studio of this period. Chaplin is the overworked assistant to a prop man named Goliath (Eric Campbell), and actually has a name in this film: David. Of course he falls for Edna, a country girl, whom he dresses up as a boy so she can get a job working as a stagehand. There is a scene where the two are caught kissing by the prop man and we get an idea of how gays were perceived in 1916. If you have been looking for a Chaplin comedy with a pie fight then realize that ""Behind the Screen"" is the only time it happens. This one takes a rather unusual twist in that the stagehands are planning a strike and end up trying to bomb the studio.

""The Immigrant"" (Released June 17, 1917) is arguably the best of Chaplin's shorts. He filmed 24 hours of footage over two months to produce a 21-minute film when most two-reelers were shot in two days. When Chaplin began, filming the restaurant scene (with Campbell as the head waiter), the film was going to be about the bohemian life, but the scene was too short and he decided to make the Tramp and the young girl immigrants, creating the opening sequence on the boat and the happy ending. Starting with the simple gag of the Tramp leaning over the ship's railing turning out to be something other than what we think, ""The Immigrant"" is classic Chaplin.

The twelve shorts Chaplin did for Mutual are collected on four volumes and clearly represent the best of his short comedies. You can basically taken any of these dozen two-reelers and compare them to what he was doing previously for Essanay to prove the point. It was at Mutual that he first started to rehearse and re-shoot scenes until they meet his exacting standards. From here Chaplin would move on to feature length silent films, taking years to finish each one but creating some of the masterpieces of American film comedy in the process. The only downside to this particular video collection is that these versions predate the recent restoration of Chaplin's Mutual comedies, which is the only reason to dock this trio a star.",1101254400,,3419,4.6583747927031505
7983679,4,B00008G8OW,"Most silent comedies tend to hold up better than dramas, particualrly the later ones where the camerawork isn't as jerky. This contains some fine little-known work. The pre-hardy Stan Laurel does a hilarious turn as a drunk caught in a compromising position with another man's wife. The forgotten Billy Richie is wildly funny as a knave who deliberately cheats on his wife and suffers the consequences. Another little-known comic, Lupino Lane, does an excellent turn in a one man, multi-character performance. As for Chaplin, even non-Chaplin fans like me will like ""The Rink"" and ""A Night at the Show."" These films show that filmed comedies had a splendid beginning.",996105600,,667,5.128440366972477
