7240287,5,B00YSBFG2E,"I thought Season Two was very lame at times. New characters, and back in New York makes this season a winner for me, so far. Have watched first four episodes. I almost did not watch.",1441584000,,182,4.228571428571429
7240288,5,B00YSBFG2E,"What a phenomenally successful show! Those fans who like this show will be riveted.
Right from the first show you are swept up and surprised.

7240289,5,B00YSBFG2E,I appreciate the creative twists and turns which keep me interested...every episode is fascinating.  The plots and the core actors are so authentic in their roles.  I also appreciate the way in which sobriety is treated and the 12-step program's value.  I LOVE this TV series!,1441411200,,276,4.956521739130435

7240292,5,B00YSBFG2E,"Look at the cover design for Seasons 1-3.
This has got to be the brownest show on television.
I love this show, but am mystified by the color scheme.
Sherlock's world is various shades of Brown, relieved only by the occasional splash of grey.
221B is frankly a dump.*
Even the wallpaper is streaked with brown stains.
Yecch.
The only exception to all this Brown is the police station where the walls are painted a sickly Green.
There is probably some deep psychological meaning to all of this.

Several reviewers have complained about the cinematography, and the picture quality in general.
It does look like the set was lit with 60 watt bulbs.
Possibly an attempt to mimic the original gaslight of Sherlock Holmes.
""Elementary"" looks like nothing else on television.
A deliberate decision.
Subtle lighting like this would actually benefit from Blu-Ray [the lack of which is my only complaint.]

* Yes, I know the New York townhouse is not really 221B, but I like to think that anywhere Sherlock Holmes lives is 221B - just like any plane the President flies on is ""Air Force One"".

The Season Three boxed set includes five mini-documentaries plus a gag reel.
Commentary track with Lucy Liu for one episode.
English SDH subtitles, Widescreen picture.

BIG CHANGES FOR SEASON THREE:
1) Watson (played by Lucy Liu) has moved out of Sherlock's townhouse and into an apartment of her own.
She even starts a rival Consulting Detective agency.
The part about Dr. Watson moving out is canonically correct, but I can't imagine John Hamish Watson going into the private eye business for himself.
Holmes misses her - Watson moved back in mid-Season [but she'll keep her Detective business.]

2) When Watson moved out, a new female assistant moved in: Kitty Winter
(played by Ophelia Lovibond)
I had a bad feeling about this. The idea of Holmes having a ""protg"" is ridiculous.
But I admit that I gradually got used to Kitty.
Just as I was finally starting to like her, Kitty left the series and moved back to London.
She's still over there at the end of Season Three.
She can always come back. OK with me.
(""Kitty"" is a canonical name - the character is loosely based on Kitty Winter from ""The Adventure of the Illustrious Client"").
MYSTERY: Turn on the subtitles - Sherlock refers to Kitty as his ""protge""
Everyone else refers to her as his ""protg""
(Sherlock's French is tres terribl ).

3) Professor Moriarty (Natalie Dormer) is in prison at the start of Season Three, but that seems a minor inconvenience.
She is able to run her Evil Empire from anywhere.
Girl Power.

4) Irene Adler, the love of Sherlock's life, is forced to spend Season Three stuck in prison with Professor Moriarty.
(I refuse to believe those ugly rumors about her and the Professor).

5) Two semi-regular characters are missing from Season Three:
- Sherlock's brother Mycroft (played by Rhys Ifans) went into witness protection at the end of Season Two, and moved to California.
I miss the sibling rivalry.
- Inspector Lestrade (Sean Pertwee) formerly of Scotland Yard, followed Holmes to New York, also setting up shop as a Consulting Dectective, but is banned from Season Three.
He was about the only comic relief on the show.
Season Four starts airing on CBS in November 2015. Perhaps some or all of these changes will be undone.

BIG CHANGE THAT FIZZLED:
At the end of Season Two, Sherlock is disillusioned with New York, and moves back to London where he is recruited by MI-6.
By the start of Season Three all this is forgotten.
MI-6 was not big enough for both James Bond and Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock moved back to New York.

Some critics complained that any updated Sherlock Holmes must be a ripoff of the BBC series ""Sherlock"" (debut 2010).
Actually, there is a long tradition of setting Holmes in the present day:
Basil Rathbone fought Nazis in ""Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror"" (1942)
There was even an updated Sherlock Holmes film set in New York with a female Dr. Watson: ""They Might be Giants"" (1971)*
George C. Scott plays a mental patient who thinks he is Sherlock Holmes.
So convincing is he that clients come to him for help.
His therapist is Dr. Joan Watson, played by Joanne Woodward.

7240293,5,B00YSBFG2E,"This is not exactly a review as I haven't viewed it yet.  Sure it will be 5 star!!  But, wasn't the price supposed to come down upon release??",1440460800,,142,4.035714285714286
7240294,5,B00YSBFG2E,"Elementary has become one of my favorite television shows.  I enjoy all things to do with Sherlock Holmes (books, movies, and television series - both serious adaptations and parodies) and at first had some doubts about of some of the modernizations of this series.  I quickly admitted my error as the show has become a very different and unique Holmes offspring while still staying true to the science of deductive reasoning.

Johnny Lee Miller is outstanding in his portrayal of Sherlock - a man devoted to solving problems.  One assumes that his mind works at a phenomenal rate and essentially can't stop the reasoning process from taking over every part of his thoughts and life.  He has almost an Asperger's type of behavior, including almost non-existent social skills.  Lucy Liu is excellent as Joan Watson, his partner.  It is with Watson that I have seen the biggest deviation from the original stories.  Watson is becoming as important an investigator as Holmes.  With Ms. Liu skillfully portraying this character, it is a pleasure to watch this transformation.  This has been my take-away of the biggest change in season 3.  I'm looking forward to seeing where the writers and actors take these characters in season 4.",1439942400,17,1229,4.9754901960784315
7240295,5,B00YSBFG2E,I love anything to do with Sherlock and was a little sceptical about it translating to the US from the UK however I love this show and agree with the other reviewer that Jonny Miller gets better and better.  Also the writing is great and the supporting case excellent.,1438819200,18,268,4.469387755102041
7240296,5,B00YSBFG2E,"Johnny Lee Miller keeps getting better in this role, and as always the writing is excellent. I would watch the show just to hear Sherlock's acerbic wit skewer people and modern institutions, but the plots are always very clever too. As I wrote in my review of season one, the idea of transplanting Holmes to Manhattan and making Watson a woman seemed terribly contrived to me at first. But I gave the show a chance and boy, I am happy I did. Seasons 1-2 were very good, but in the third season Miller and Liu seemed to really make the role their own. I look forward to buying this season and re-watching all the episodes prior to season four.",1438387200,32,642,4.4033613445378155

After seeing other Holmesian adaptations or influeneces, where they just stretched the concept of Holmes' deductive reasoning to him basically being telepathically psychic to know everything about everything and still everything in between (like Goren in L&O:CI) I was hesitant to get into the show, figuring I'd detest everything about it.  I ordered the first season just as a ""WTH, why not"" kind of thing, and love the show. It dives into the mindset and logic of Holmes, without making him to be some annoying parody, like I feared.  In short, the entire series is interesting, mind-boggling, and captivating. I now have the four seasons available on DVD.",1486425600,2,740,4.904

The only reason I wanted to watch the American version was because of Johnny Lee Miller, who is an excellent British actor.  I knew I wouldn't be let down if he was in it.  And I was right.

7240725,2,B00YSBFG2E,"I rolled my eyes when they placed Sherlock Holmes as a recovering drug addict in season 1, but the spins on the other characters as well as the content of the show made that at least tolerable. The intrigue of the character was intact and they added plenty of dimensions and interactions with the changes to Watson and Moriarty that it was worthwhile. The second season was still good, but the rehab rubbish was already getting old. With this season, they have managed to turn a dynamic, unique literary character completely one-dimensional and easily summed up by the term 'recovering addict'. It consumes him in this show to the point where you can guess what he is going to do pretty much all of the time now. He fits so neatly in the box they've carved out for him that they've sapped almost all mystery surrounding the character.

One of the reasons Watson wrote about Holmes in the books was that he wasn't someone that could be easily defined, yet this show goes out of its way to define him as a drug addict first and consulting detective a distant second.  I won't give spoilers, but the overall arc of this season is not only contrived, but also obsessively  determined to cram Holmes in that box. The final mystery is a laugher with a paper-thin motive from the culprit. I almost threw up in my mouth when it was all wrapped up in the finale it was so frustrating. They've beaten the addict angle to death, ten-fold, buried it, dug it up, then beat it some more.

Watson, thankfully, is interesting enough to make up for some of it. It is odd that the character that, in the books, was the 'every-person' to Holmes' mystique, should be so much more interesting than him in this version. Further, very little is given to either Aidan Quinn or Jon Michael Hill as Gregson and Bell to work with aside from cop cliches. Their acting is still pretty good, they just aren't given enough character development to distinguish them from the other million cops on tv these days. My patience is wearing very thin with this version of one of my favorite literary characters. Good acting and decent enough mysteries, but beyond that, not much else going that wasn't already done much better in the first two seasons. Time may be running out for elementary if they don't reclaim some of the mystery that made us love the Holmes stories in the first place.",1454284800,6,2352,4.57957244655582

7240733,5,B00YSBFG2E,"Elementary - Season 3 - [0611 - January 2, 2015]

Content:
The DVD package for Season 3 consists of 24 episodes on six disks. There are many extra features that detail series background and production issues on several disk - although no deleted scenes. The episodes were first shown on the CBS network October 30, 2014 to May 14, 2015 and the season 3 DVD package was released for sale on August 25, 2015.

Summary:
These comments are primarily for Season 3 and it is assumed you have seen previous episodes of this show.

Honestly I was at first skeptical about another take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's sleuths Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. This iteration features the analytical Holmes as manic ex-drug addict abet a certified genius. Dr. Watson is an oriental lady that turned away from her medical career as a surgeon to be a companion for recovering addicts. After meeting Holmes she decided assisting him and the NYC police were a better use for her talents.

  I am of the oppinion based upon my viewing experiences that many a successful TV series tends to coast during the subsequent seasons. The entire cast knows two things: season 1 was a success and they have a job for the next year. Sometimes the writer's get into a rut - what worked before should work again. The creative brains are reluctant to up-end the chemistry among principal cast members or introduce new talents. These issues do not happen with every series but I consider that when I evaluate TV series.

In my opinion ""Elementary"" Season 3 continues to delight this viewer and I list some of my reasons below.

Positive Comments:
 The Watson and Sherlock detective relationship took a major turn during Season 3. Watson remains a consultant to the NY Police but now works independently of Holmes.
 Holmes returned from England brings a new apprentice detective Kitty Winter who in effect replaces Watson. Although Watson is featured in every show the emotion undercurrent with Kitty adds an intersting twist to the stories.
 How the Kitty/Watson fandango shakes out - Watson's love affair and the interaction of Sherlock with his ex drug dealer made season 3 compelling viewing.
 One of the guilty pleasures of watching these shows is the nuanced relationship of Holmes and Watson. Holmes is manic and impulsive - prone to jumping to conclusions - mostly correct when involved solving a crime. Watson presents an inscrutable face when Holmes goes off - counseling restrain or at least grudging cooperation.
 Sherlock's introspective ruminations on addiction, relationships and life are almost worth watching the show for.
The Cast:
 The ultimate success of this show revolves around the cast. Two relative unknowns Jonny Lee Miller (Holmes) and Lucy Liu (Watson) are convincing and entertaining in difficult and challenging roles.
 The two NYPD detectives that work with Holmes are well above average in a supporting role. Played by Jon Hill (Detective Marcus Bell) and Aidan Quinn (Detective Tommy Gregson) they push back when Holmes goes off on a manic tangent but respect his superior intuitive crime solving abilities.

Negative Comments:
 OK Sherlock talks fast but is it me or does he whisper and mumble a lot? I find myself looking at my wife asking what did he say? The other characters I can hear and understand clearly. Not a big deal but it irked me.
 Sure wish there were deleted scenes included with the DVD's, but alas there are none.

My Opinion:
If you enjoyed previous episodes of this show you will be, I believe, pleased and very entertained with season 3. The main characters continue to entertain and evolve added to the viewing pleasure of this remarkable series.",1451692800,3,3669,4.917341977309563

7240802,5,B00YSBFG2E,"""Elementary,"" the updated addition to the Sherlock Holmes saga, continues to delight me with its sharp writing, interesting plots and an excellent cast.
At the conclusion of Season 2 Holmes had abandoned New York to return to London where he was, briefly, employed by the UK's secret service. When he pulled up stakes he left his former sober companion turned sleuth Dr. Joan Watson on her own.
In Season 3 we learn that she is doing quite well without him and that it is he who will have to earn her trust if they are ever going to work together again.
Season 3 is actually less plot driven than the first two installments in the series. It is, instead, character driven as is evident, for example, in Lucy Liu's portray of an ever-evolving Watson. By introducing a new person into the mix - the emotionally troubled but brilliant Kitty Winter - the writers allow Liu and Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes to further develop their characters. Holmes is, when he returns to New York with Ms. Winter in tow - more subdued, less sharp tongued when it comes to his interaction with Watson, for example. It is clear that their relationship has changed during his absence: She is no longer a protege but a full-fledged detective in her own right and expects to be treated as such. To his credit, Holmes seems to realize this and while he can still be rude and obnoxious with the rest of the world he gradually understands that he can longer trample on Watson's emotions.
The result: Season 3 is an excellent addition to the series and one I highly recommend.",1445212800,,1546,4.584837545126354

7240808,5,B00YSBFG2E,"The first half of the season more or less focuses on a new character, Kitty Winter, and how both Sherlock and Watson cope with her presence in their lives. I actually enjoyed her presence and what she brought to the show since she added. It also focuses this season on Sherlock's other relationships outside of Watson which is refreshing. The ending of the season is dramatic though the finale left  a bitter taste in my mouth. Overall enjoyable.",1444435200,3,446,4.717948717948718

7240829,5,B00YSBFG2E,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

At the end of season two of this series, an update of the classic criminal detective, we were left wondering what would happen next. A set up of several episodes involving Sherlocks (Johnny Lee Miller) brother Mycroft (Rhys Ifans) as well as the kidnapping and rescue of Holmes trainee Dr. Jane Watson (Lucy Liu), a rift between teacher and student formed that left her seeking a place of her own and Holmes returning to England.

All of this is responded to in the first episode which finds Watson now working on her own as well as assisting Captain Gregson (Aidan Quinn). Word reaches her that Holmes is back from England to live in New York again after having been fired by MI6.  Not only that, hes brought along a new protg as well, Kitty Winter (Ophelia Lovibond). But before the department will allow her to work with them she needs to prove herself.

What this does is set up a new dynamic between not only Holmes and Watson but with Kitty as well. There is no way that a certain amount of jealousy must rise up between both Watson and Kitty, not the sexual type of jealousy but the desire to prove their worthiness to Holmes. Watson may be more self-assured with more confidence in her abilities having spent the time she did with home, but the idea of being replaced is sure to rattle. Kitty at the same time finds herself jealous of the comradery and closeness of her mentor and his ex-protg. And Holmes remains as aloof as ever, rarely noticing what is going on between the two.

This sets up a new aspect to the series that changes with time as we near the seasons end. Kitty has secrets in her past that only Holmes knows. When Watson is brought into the fold, the tension between the two women changes to one of friendship and concern. And, once more, Holmes more often than not is uninvolved with these issues, more concerned with focusing on crime.

Episodes run the usual gamut of various day to day crimes from theft to murder but mostly focus on murder here. The safety and past history of Kitty is brought to the forefront later in the season which brings everyone involved to circle the wagons and protect one of their own. But the deepest and darkest episodes this season revolve around Holmes drug use, past and possibly present. One episode has him tracing his steps after a blackout. Was he drugged or did he fall victim to his past drug use again? The final episode has Holmes trying to find his ex-sobriety sponsor who has disappeared, another link to his past problems.

The proper combination of storylines and character creation have made this series one that Ive loved watching. Miller does an amazing job as Holmes, creating the famed sleuth we know from the past but making him more current in a way few have been able to accomplish. Liu as Watson has made what was depicted as a bumbling fool in the Rathbone/Bruce series of films into an accomplished detective in her own right. The two play-off of one another quite well here.

Once more, as Ive written on several other series, this one ended making me want more. It meant that Id have to wait until the following season to see what comes next. With this one it meant I needed to hope that CBS had enough faith in it for it to return since the ratings were not spectacular. With any luck that will change this year and more will discover the joy of this series.",1443484800,,3404,4.5056726094003245

7240846,5,B00YSBFG2E,"This 21st century Sherlock Holmes always ""gets his man"", as the bleedin' bloody red Canadian Mounties put it, but the real question is, ""Will he get the girl?""  The ""Girl"" is played by Lucy Liu as Dr. Joan Watson.  This TV series amusingly and creatively resurrects the old Hollywood adage that there is but ONE Story:  Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl.  The question boils down to, ""Will Sherlock get Watson before Moriarty (the first ""Girl"" in the above Hollywood formula) gets HIM?""  My money's on the creative ""twists"" [a pun on the 40's gangster slang for a ""Girl""] in the Hollywood ONE Story. ---Tom Lang, a.k.a.

Series 1 and 2 proved it worked.  Series 3 seals that in concrete.  These two actors have a repour that works well.  Watson as a woman opens up all manner of story lines that are of interest.  AND not to be unnoticed...the music in this series is fantastic.  The entire series is worth watching, more than once.  For Sherlock fans, it's a new idea.",1441584000,8,517,4.347368421052631
