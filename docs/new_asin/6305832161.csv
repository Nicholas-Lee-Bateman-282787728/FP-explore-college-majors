1091440,5,6305832161,"Yes, the ""Health Department"" skit was very sick, but the movie in general was great!  This movie was the debuts of both Chevy Chase and Richard Belzer. My favorite skits include ""KoKo the Clown"" and  the ""Geritan"" commercial. The fantasy show ""Dealers""  was also a great add on to this classic movie. So, if you want to laugh  your head off, this classic comedy is for you!",960854400,,373,4.522388059701493

1091662,5,6305832161,"I strongly disagree with the review provided by K. Person who gave a one-star rating.  I too, saw this in the movie theater in 1974 with a double feature (""Portnoy's Complaint"") as a teenager. I'm 58 1/2 years old now.  I enjoyed the first feature, ""The Groove Tube"", with many laughs.  I recently purchased this new DVD and still laughing.  I play it for guests and they want to see it all over again and again.  The three funniest segments in the movie I laugh at the most are, ""The Hitchhiker"", ""KOKO, the clown show"", and ""The Dealers"".  This movie will never get old in my opinion. HILARIOUS! It's sad to read that K. Person liked only the ""Brown-25"" commercial skit.  To each their own...",1496448000,,694,4.504
1091663,1,6305832161,"I saw this in 1974 and thought it was HILARIOUS. (I was probably mostly captured by the occasional appearances of completely nude attractive women.) It seems teenage me had all the cultural taste of a rotten tomatoe. I am 59 now, and I bought this expecting to be a fun nostalgic romp. NOPE. It is weak, weak, weak. The skits are all unendurably long, and honestly not funny, even given their 1970's aesthetic. The director Ken Shapiro is in many of the skits, and he is simply a lousy actor and not the least bit funny. You can see that Shapiro fancied himself as a John Belushi type character, FAIL. The strongest bits are a couple of spoof tv commercials, mainly because they are short and focused on a single punch line.

However, the rest of the movie did not have the same type of sense of humor.  It was very ""70's"" when most of the humor seemed to be around stickin' it to the man and the sexual revolution or something.  Not that I'm a history buff or anything. If you are into long drawn out sketches about a couple of goofy pot dealers who get caught in situations where they need to get rid of their stash by flushing it down the toilet, or by eating it and etc. and so on... Then you may enjoy this.  If you were not an active part of the 70's, then you probably won't find much of this funny.

I shared it with my girlfriend a couple of days after it arrived, as she'd seen it during its original theatrical run, too.  The jokes don't wear quite as well, so it would get only two or three stars for that.  Still, the nostalgia factor, and seeing just how many of the sketches were later ""borrowed"" by others, ramps it up to four stars.  One of the most notable borrowings was the news program, showing bizarre clips of weird stories, which we saw used by Chevy Chase on SNL the following year, under the Weekend Update banner.  Chase and Richard Belzer are the only two people I recognized from the cast when watching it again, but this is some of their funniest early stuff.

If you haven't watched the movie before, I would have to say that the older you are the more likely you are to appreciate and enjoy the humor.  Younger viewers might need some explanation of what's being parodied, unless they've had a lot of exposure to humor from the 70's and 80's already.  Not for kids, by the way.

1092563,3,6305832161,"Before SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE was on tv, and before AIRPLANE!, and even before KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE, there was a little movie called THE GROOVE TUBE that was really the first over-the-top-satirical-movie-comedy.  First shown in theatres in wide release in 1974, the movie is a series of sketches that parody and satirize popular television segments and movie sequences of the time.

The sketches vary in style and format. Featuring a group of humanoid apes that are drawn to a strange-humming quadratic object, the opening sequence of the movie parodies the opening of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. A sketch shortly after parodies many drive-in movies of the period having a hitchhiker meeting a beautiful companion that ends with a naked romp through the woods.  In another sketch a corporate sponsored cooking show features the sponsor's shortening used through-out the cooking process and ends in a dish not quite picture-perfect.

The longest sequence in the movie is a short film entitled ""The Dealers."" It revolves around a couple of pot-heads who are attempting to become dealers and not just users.  There are some funny moments in the spoof, particularly during the movie theatre, but the piece goes on for far too long.

One of the more clever sketches in the movie is the ""Koko the Clown"" segment.  The piece begins with a basic children's format, but during ""special imagination time"" while the big people are all supposed to be out of the room, Koko sits down, pulls off his nose, and reads letters from children and their requested pieces of literature.  Also memorable is a PSA about venereal disease that features a carefully masqueraded body part and a series of corporate energy commercials from the Uranus Corporation.

Besides being notable for being one of the first, if not the first movie of its type, THE GROOVE TUBE is notable for two actors who appear in it.  The first is a young Richard Belzer.  Belzer appears in several of the sketches, but is featured in ""The Dealers.""  The other actor in the movie worth noting is Chevy Chase.  Chase only appears in one memorable sketch that is like a human-performance act one might see on a variety show (which were still popular at the time).  Also, during the fake news broadcast, the host says the line, ""Good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow.""  That line was Chevy Chase's closing line at SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE as the ""Weekend Update"" host.

There are a several funny things in THE GROOVE TUBE and a few comedic gems.  The movie is definitely outrageous, at times crude and almost revolting.  However, even putting that aside some of the gags just don't work.

The biggest negative about THE GROOVE TUBE is that it hasn't aged very well.  So much of the humor relies upon a person having some connection to the television commercials, media formats, and movie sequences of the early 1970s.  Young film buffs will recognize some of the references, e.g. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and the Cheech and Chong movies.  However, they don't make, let along air them on tv, the type of low-budget PSAs as satirized in the movie.  Someone under the age of 35 has never seen a corporate commercial similar to the ones the Uranus Corporation segments parody.  Cooking shows don't feature their sponsor's foodstuffs and unless someone has seen Monty Python sketches, the under 30 crowd probably will find the on-spot reporting with the roving reporter unusual.

There were parts of the movie that I really like and others that I found dull. Fans of movies like KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE and AIRPLANE! might enjoy THE GROOVE TUBE.  Those who were college students in the 1970s might also enjoy watching the movie for nostalgic reasons (from what I've been told the movie was shown at a lot of college campuses during the mid-1970s).  For film and entertainment buffs, the movie is worth watching because it was one of the originators (if not The originator) of a particular type of movie comedy as well seeing Richard Belzer and Chevy Chase in one of their earliest film roles.  Beyond that, the movie is a curiosity, but not really a must-see.",1289347200,,4084,4.854256854256854
1092564,4,6305832161,"The Groove Tube was a precursor to many trends in adult entertainment, including ""Saturday Night Live.""  It's a set of short stories, ""commercials,"" and blackouts, featuring people like Richard Belzer and Chevy Chase.  Aimed squarely at a mid-1970s young adult/college crowd, the humor is topical, risque, sometimes illicit.

The DVD is a very good transfer-better than the print I saw in the theater.  There aren't a lot of special features, but instead there are chapter-by-chapter bookmarks for each skit.  The overall quality is excellent.  On a fairly large TV, the experience is very ""theater-like.""

Overall, I would recommend The Groove Tube to anyone who had enjoyed it when it was released, and anyone younger who saw more comedy than the overt jokes on Saturday Night Live or Second City.  This is a good catch.",1277337600,4,822,5.082089552238806

Sure, it's low budget. Undoubtedly, it's crude and vulgar. At times, it's just brilliant satire. Nonetheless, ""The Groove Tube"" maintains a very consistent level of humor. Often times, it's just downright outrageous, and I cry. And, it's all done without a large Hollywood budget or concerns for political correctness which nows infests American society. Hell, back then political correctness was just being conceived. There's an abortion I would have happily supported.

Thirty years later, the humor is still relevant. The humor is still cutting edge. Nothing is sacred. I can only imagine the outrage, if this film were to be released today. Planned Parenthood would be screaming for litigation.

I will admit two things. The drug dealer sequence is boring; it just doesn't fit in and hurts the flow of the film. Secondly, I have sat in a room of people and was the only one laughing hysterically.

It's a little bit National Lampoon and a little bit Saturday Night Live at it's prime.",1105833600,13,1015,4.988165680473373

The true indication that comedy is uncreative is when they resort to nudity as a crutch.  One scene was really obscene.  The scene was a children's clown asking every non-kid to leave the room before he read sexually explicit passages from romance novels.  If you are thinking of buying this, do this.

Best of all though is writer, director, producer Ken Shapiro's manic pas de deux down a busy Manhattan street, while he sings Nat King Cole's Just You Just Me. It is forever etched in my mind.

The only real weakness with Groove Tube is that much of its satire focuses upon television.  Therefore, unlike the movies parodied in KFM and AWOTM, much of the source material satirized in Groove Tube is no longer available or as much in the public mind.  For example, there is a parody of a famous commercial from the 1970s with the sexist line ""My wife, I think I'll keep her"".  All the parodies can be enjoyed on their own, but they lose some of their punch if you are unfamiliar with what they're making fun of.
Of course, most of the sentiments covered in the movie are still part of the culture, so the parody still works if you are unfamiliar with 1970s television, and there are a few parodies of things everyone knows, like Kubrick's 2001.  And you don't have to, e.g., sit through reruns of such shows as Starsky and Hutch to appreciate the long sketch about two buddy drug dealers starring Richard Belzer (perhaps this sketch portrays his cop character's hinted at rebellious days?).

A very good friend of mine and I did the Skit with Chevy Chase and the '4 Leaf Clover' song as a gag for a High School 'Talent Show' and it was a blast - I sang and took the hit, and he was the Straight-man, it was great fun and the movie is far better - it's a compilation of skits that are truly funny as heck - one of the best is a vignette of a Public Service Announcement regarding the perils of Venereal Diseases and it's done just perfectly, I must preface this as a total spoiler alert: The scene is (I haven't seen this for 30 years) like a poster with a little man in the middle that looks perfectly reasonable at first (for that time on TV) and slowly zooms in to the little guy giving the PSA, eventually it gets to the point  that you realize it's actually an upside-down penis that has been talking to you all this time... it's far funnier than I can express, but I figure no one reads these anyway, so it probably won't ruin it for anyone... but if it does, please respond to this Review, which means you have to watch it - Amazon streams it for $2.99 to rent and $9.99 to buy and view online, $15 for the DVD - I'd like to see that SOMEONE actually reads these, so if you are looking for a few REAL LAUGHS, which are quite few for me, this is the movie for you so invite all your Buddies (and Gals, don't want to discriminate) over and check it out.
