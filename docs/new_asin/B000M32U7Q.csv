8504685,4,B000M32U7Q,"I have bought quite a few Taiji videos before ( including Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming's ) but none was able to satisfy my need to perfect the form. This Taiji Video that consist of 3 separate DVDs was the closest thing to what I want. It has excellent instructional video, very good step analysis and at the end, you got a completely demonstration of the forms with subtitled name of the steps while it was performed.
That being said, I would not recommend it to anyone who does not speak Mandarin, or read Chinese. Although it has an English Audio Track and an English subtitle, the translation was so bad that it bears little resemblance to what was being said or meant to be said at times.
For those that need English instruction, you will be better off with ""Tai Chi for Health"" with Terence Dunn. Though not as detail as ""Yang Style Taiji Quan"" with Yang Zhengduo, it is rather easy for follow and nicely demonstrated.",1254182400,,915,4.518072289156627
