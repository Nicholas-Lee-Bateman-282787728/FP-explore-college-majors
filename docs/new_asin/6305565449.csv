Gohan, Krillin, and Dende summon the Namek Dragon,  Porunga, and Vegeta sees them first.  So Vegeta gets angry and threatens to  kill all of them if Dende does not wish for him to be immortal.  Dende  refuses but Krillin tells him to make the wish for Vegeta.  Just as Dende  starts to make the wish, Frieza appears and he is not happy at all.  Vegeta  and Frieza begin fighting and Vegeta basically has the upper hand in the  battle.  But then Vegeta makes a very bad decision by encouraging Frieza to  transform.  Frieza transforms into a giant creature with an enourmous power  level.  And that is how the Frieza Saga begins.  You will have to watch  this video and the rest of the Frieza Saga to find out what happens.",963964800,2,887,4.39751552795031
