8560036,5,B00B04NJ0S,"Keep in mind, this is a cheap, double sided Blu-ray from a bulk producer of low cost Blu-rays. That having been said, the quality was better than some I've purchased from reputable companies with reputable 1080p prints (Warner brothers comes to mind) and some I've purchased form overseas that were exclusively available in only one country but turned out to be PAL prints that were just upscaled to look better than the PAL print and far better than our 480p NTSC prints we have in America. I was actually expecting that this would be an upscaled PAL but it was, clearly from a higher quality source. That is not to say that it is perfect. There are moments of DNR and moments of grain that seem new to the films (to my recollection) but, overall, these are HD prints and the sound is pretty good/fair and the color pops more than on DVD, as Blu-ray should. For such a low cost, I can honestly recommend this combination pack if you like one or both of these films. I don't think we'll see a better release of either of them in the future.",1407628800,5,1040,4.421875

Spoilers may be lurking. This remake of the 1950 original isn't up to the standard set by that film noir classic, but it does do it justice. This film has the same central theme (hero mysteriously poisoned) but the setting and the circumstances are much different.

Here Dennis Quaid plays Dexter Cornell, an English professor at the University of Texas (I think). He's struggling to keep his marriage together, having been separated from Gail (Jane Kaczmarek). It seems she has been unhappy for some time, primarily because Dexter ignores her. The cause is apparently the fact that Dex abandon a once successful career as a novelist. What Dex doesn't know is that Gail has been playing kissy face with Nick (Robert Knepper) one of Dexter's students. Nick had been hounding Dex to read a novel he'd written and offer some advice. As it turns out Nick is also the beneficiary of a scholarship provided by Mrs. Fitzwaring, a wealthy alum. Nick was the son of a man who killed Mr. Fitzwaring. Say what?

In any case, Nick is killed falling from the building where Dex teaches. Daniel Stern plays a good friend of Dex and Gail's, hoping to get a recommendation for tenure at the school. Dex is drinking heavily and finds himself passed out in the dorm room of a freshman student named Sydney Fuller, played by Meg Ryan who was also Quaid's main squeeze, off camera, at the time. With more than just a hangover, Dex is ill enough to check into a hospital only to find out that he had been poisoned somewhere along the line and that there is no cure. He's given enough of a pick-me-up to keep him going but his prognosis is certain death in the next 24-48 hours.

He goes to Gail but stumbles in on an intruder and is knocked out. When he comes to, he finds her murdered and he is now the prime suspect given that the two dead people are now connected. Eluding the police, Dex drags Sydney along in an effort to find out how he was poisoned and when. The why and when is what keeps the mystery going. Even with a few suspects, it is fairly easy to spot the who.

The film's directors, Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton give the film a noirish modern day feel. They even use a black and white opening (and closing) sequence similar to the 1950 original. Dennis Quaid gives one of his best performances here as well. While not as good as the original, the film has enough going for it to be recommended.

The Blu ray transfer comes with 1080p resolution and has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. While this isn't a demo grade disc, it is certainly serviceable for a bargain basement purchase. The film grain remains and is occasionally faulty. There are a few dull shots and the film does suffer a bit from inconsistency. Still not a big issue. The audio features a DTS-HD Master Audio 4.0 track with stereo up front and a mono surround track in the rear. A bit unusual but it works fine. Like the video it is nothing special but nothing terrible either. There is a trailer and English subtitles only as far as extras.

CONSENTING ADULTS (1992) 3 1/2 stars.

There may be spoilers.  This suburban thriller takes a familiar theme of greed, sex and deception and blends them into a modest, but interesting story. Directed by Alan J. Pakula, the film is set in suburban Atlanta. Richard and Priscilla Parker (Kevin Kline and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) work in the music industry. Richard writes and records jingles for commercials and his wife acts in the agent/PR/producer role. They make a decent living but are in debt and have a daughter in a private high school for the musically gifted.

A new couple moves in next door. Eddy Otis (a blond Kevin Spacey) is an investment counsellor and his wife Kay (also blond Rebecca Miller) is a small time lounge singer with a quiet sultry voice. The 2 couples become close friends. Richard is fascinated by the gorgeous Kay and her voice, wondering why she hasn't been recorded. Priscilla finds Eddy's devil-may-care ways exhilarating. In short, when they spend time together it's often Eddy with Priscilla and Kay with Richard. Yeah, you can easily see where this is all going. That is one of the problems with the film. The tells are easily spotted.

When Eddy notices Richard's attention to Kay, he suggests a one-time only, wife-swap in the middle of the night when the ladies are sleeping. You know, they wouldn't even know the difference. Uh, sure. Richard is offended and breaks off their friendship. He goes into some trance-like moments, obviously secretly intrigued by the idea. Priscilla begins to squabble with Richard not knowing why they all can't be friends and suggests that he be more fun-like as Eddy is. He takes that as a green light and sets up the switch with Eddy.

The next day, the police swarm all over the Otis home as Kay has been found murdered. And guess who suspect number one is. I shouldn't give too much away, but the movie switches gears as Richard, assisted by a private detective (Forest Whitaker) set out to track down the real killer. Again, all of this is fairly predictable. Yet there are still some surprises to come, and that's what makes the film interesting. The actors do a commendable job, with Spacey chewing up every scene he's in. Kline is always solid and no exception here. But I was really impressed with the ladies. For this film to work they had to sell their causal flirtatious ways. Too much would have been unrealistic and too obvious. Too little would have not been enough to encourage the boys.

The Blu ray transfer is certainly acceptable if unexceptional. It has a 1080p resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. There are a few imperfections but rarely are they particularly noticeable. Black levels are OK but are inconsistent. Colors are OK but nothing special. I noticed no flickering. The audio comes courtesy of DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Much like the video, it is fine but the lack of surround channels is noticeable. I also found the dialog to be a little hit or miss at times. Certainly not a great audio experience. Still it is quite listenable. There are no subtitles options and no extras.",1404345600,,6109,4.634935304990758
