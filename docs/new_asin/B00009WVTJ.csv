1896620,1,B00009WVTJ,I have been watching these online and I would have to say this set is only worth 40 dollars not for the price they are asking here. The reason The first Black Scorpion movie had police cars wiping out and the same cars were used in every episode on this set including scenes used from other episodes Roger Corman's best work yeah right more like Cheap work!  Not worth the money for such a cheaply made show!,1287878400,3,408,4.298701298701299
1896621,4,B00009WVTJ,"Watch out evil-doers--Black Scorpion is on the prowl!  This review is for BLACK SCORPION--THE TV SERIES released on DVD in 2003 by New Concorde.  BLACK SCORPION is a very fun, incredibly(!!!) campy super-hero TV series.  The series was filmed in 1998 but didn't premiere until early 2001 (airing on the SCI-FI Channel).  The gorgeous Michelle Lintel plays the Black Scorpion to perfection and is even better as her alter ego, Darcy Walker.  This series is not to be taken the slightest bit seriously and all of the performers camp it up to the max. Martin Kove (""Hard Time on Planet Earth"") in particular is great as the evil Firearm and Robert Pine (""C.H.i. P.s"") is hilarious as the truly worthless Mayor Worth.  Any show that features a bevy of beautiful Playboy models as various super-villains is definitely must-see TV!  This show looks beautiful on DVD--all of the episodes are super-clear and the audio is pristine.  BLACK SCORPION is well worth purchasing--this DVD set will be in my DVD collection forever!

Don't hesitate to add BLACK SCORPION--THE TV SERIES to your DVD library.
A few other fun/campy TV shows that I would recommend are: SHE-WOLF OF LONDON/LOVE & CURSES, CLEOPATRA 2525, JACK OF ALL TRADES, THE MIDDLEMAN, CONAN THE ADVENTURER, MUTANT X and THE IMMORTAL starring Lorenzo Lamas.",1273449600,13,3219,5.176356589147287
1896622,5,B00009WVTJ,This was a really fun series and it's quite an impressive DVD set. One of the nicest looking DVD sets I own as a matter of fact. I loved this show and every episode of the series is here on DVD to enjoy over and over. A great buy for Scorpion fans.,1102464000,3,248,3.7884615384615383
1896623,4,B00009WVTJ,"At the time of its filming, Roger Corman described the Black Scorpion tv series as his ultimate life's work. He believed in it so much that he poured his life savings into making all 22 episodes without going through the usual procedure of making a pilot episode and approaching television channels. As a result there was a two-year gap between the filming of the series and its first airing. Was it worth it?
First of all, what was the goal of the series? It was meant as a respectful homage to the 60's Batman series, combined with the sexy fighting females so common in Corman's films. The bat became a scorpion, the man became a woman. The tongue-in-cheek humour and camp nature of Batman were to be retained.
As a crime-fighting icon, Black Scorpion is an immediate success. While the 60's needed a male hero, our 21st Century is better fitted with a powerful female to bring law and order. Michelle Lintel proves to be an adequate replacement to Joan Severance, who played Black Scorpion in the previous films. Her self-confident entrances with corny jokes are the equal of Batman at his best. The colourful villains are made even better by their inherant lack of credibility. This is escapism at its best, not reality! The references to Batman are strengthened by casting Adam West as Breathtaker and Frank Gorshin as Clockwise. Other elements used as sub-plots to the series are the incompetent police force, the corrupt politicians, and the budding love affair between Black Scorpion's alter-ego and a police detective.
However, the series has weaknesses that need to be addressed. Despite the large budget, the car chase scenes are constantly re-used, which I find grating. Gangster Prankster's character is based so closely on the Joker that Corman can be accused of plagiarism. But the greatest weakness is that the comic elements are overdone. It's one thing that the police are incapable of dealing with super-villians -- that's why Black Scorpion is needed -- but it's another to portray the police as layabouts who throw baseballs about in the station instead of trying to solve crimes. Scott Valentine is a credible detective, but Shane Powers and Steven Kravitz are totally out of place. The running humour between the scientific genius (B.T.) and his scatty girlfriend (Enya Flack) is so silly that it just isn't funny. How could a man like that love a woman like that?
Overall, the series is a success, and the DVD box set is good value for money. It's a crime that until now Black Scorpion has rarely been aired and still remains unknown. If Roger Corman has any money left, he should make a second, improved series of Black Scorpion, toning down the sillier humour. The series has the potential to become a classic, but based on the evidence of the first series, it isn't quite there yet.",1076976000,52,2810,4.831950207468879
1896624,5,B00009WVTJ,Black Scorpion is a flash back to the style of the comic books of the 60's with one major exception: Michelle Lintel is far hotter than anything in those old comics! If you like old comics and also love beautiful women then this will do the trick. It's a beautiful DVD set too. I can't get over how great this set looks!,1073001600,9,320,4.17741935483871
1896625,5,B00009WVTJ,"I agree with seawasp's review. This is very entertaining with tongue firmly in cheek. The set comes with excellent artwork and the 16 page booklet is full of colorful stills of the super villains. An added bonus is Behind The Sting: The Making Black Scorpion  hosted and narrated by none other than our favourite hero ADAM WEST, who also happens to appear in four episodes as 'The Breathtaker'. Interviews with Roger Corman and other cast members are both informative and entertaining as is the audio commentary on the first two episodes.
It is also good to see Frank Gorshin as Clockwise make a memorable appearance.
Buy it now you will not be sorry.",1065916800,15,651,4.761061946902655

1896628,2,B00009WVTJ,"Pretty awful, really. I don't know what possessed me to order this beyond its cult following. Lord knows I've never subscribed to the theory that Roger Corman has big talent, despite some good Edgar Allen Poe adaptations with Vincent Price. Unfortunately, this series isn't available on Netflix, so if you want to watch it, you gotta buy it. Please be warned. This is camp on the level of the 1960s Batman, minus the POW BAM etc. The villains just do not stop laughing, and they have idiot minions who caper about like--well, idiots. I do believe you have to be IQ-impaired to enjoy Black Scorpion. Maybe if I contract some dire flu I can binge on it, but those maniacally laughing villains and villainesses make it tough to struggle through an episode. If you can't get enough of Black Scorpion ""strutting"" with butt-cheeks on display--and I really mean can't get enough--then you're in for a treat, but again, you must be IQ-compromised. This is about on the level of World Wrestling Federation, or maybe aspires to be. Not even enjoyably bad, just unimaginative and routine. I'll check back with you later if I accidentally take some Dolt Pills. Maybe then I'll see the light.",1408233600,2,1179,4.784313725490196

1896630,4,B00009WVTJ,Michelle Lintel as Black Scorpion is hot. Good Villians series doesn't take itself too seriously. Some funny lines from Black Scorpion. No Masterpiece theater but it isn't pretending to be. Great fight scenes and it is great that she sometimes loses and gets knocked out,1378252800,2,270,5.022222222222222
1896631,3,B00009WVTJ,"it was an awesome ride as it began, but as it wore on to it's conclusion i felt it kinda lost focus. the ending should have been better and the prelude to conclusion should have been more definite instead of inconclusive.",1357430400,,221,4.414634146341464
1896632,2,B00009WVTJ,"I have to say this was the worst TV series I have ever bought on DVD. I bought this on sale. There is no way I would pay $59.98 for this series. The only reason I didn't give this 1 star was because of guests such as Adam West, Lou Ferrigno and others. I usually don't rate movies I buy on Amazon but as bad as this series was I needed to warn people. The first movie I thought was fine. Black Scorpion II not very good. The acting in the series is terrible and so are the costumes. For Roger Corman to put his whole life in this series (I know he doesn't have the budget of the big studios) but he could have tried to keep the actors from the movies. Joan Severance, Garrett Morris and others are better than the TV series Michelle Lintel and B.T.

In the series Roger has copied to many of his characters from Star Wars or DC Comics. Black Scorpion reminds me of Catwoman. Breathtaker to me has been to close to Darth Vader. Medusa is a version off of Mr. Freeze. Prankster is the Joker combined with Two-Face. Angel of Death has the killer kiss that Poison Ivy has. Greenthumb is also to close to Poison Ivy. It's sad when writers and costume designers start coping each other because they can't come up with anything on their own.

A lot of the fight scenes to me weren't shot right on angles. You can see when Black Scorpion goes to kick or punch someone; she has made no contact at all with the other actors. This to me killed the action. The comedy they try to blend in just didn't feel right. If you want super hero action movies or TV series stick with DC or Marvel. You will get what you pay for.",1351641600,3,1606,4.144230769230769
1896633,5,B00009WVTJ,"Your kids will not be disappointed. After pIaying the first episode of Black Scorpion, I didn't play the show for a day. Then my kids ran over the next day and asked to keep watching the series.",1348876800,,194,4.27027027027027
1896634,5,B00009WVTJ,"Fed up with corruption and haunted by her father's murder Detective Darcy Walker becomes a vigilante. As the Black Scorpion, she protects Angel City from the criminals that are too powerful for police. Each episode she faces -off against super villains bent on destroying the world.  While she stays one step ahead of the police looking to arrest her. This includes her coworker Steve Rafferty the man she's in love with.
Although Black Scorpion is campy there are at times romantic subplots,and political, or environmental messages that give the show depth.  The things I like best about Black Scorpion are:
* Michelle Lintel is very attractive and the Black Scorpion costume is quite sexy.
* Most of the villains are women that are just as hot as Michelle.
* Amazing amount of cleavage in camera angles.
* Black Scorpion and her antagonist fight three- four times each episode.
* Despite them having a sympathetic back story Black Scorpion always kills her foe.
* Car explosions, not CGI, but real cars blowing up.
The packaging of the disc is very nice.",1346284800,6,1056,4.861111111111111

7994158,4,B00009WVTJ,"Roger Corman is my main source for good old trashy fun. This show does not let me down. The show is done on a tight budget but don't let that fool you as the action is fun and the writing ridiculous (but that is why we watch it)
Beautiful women in tight outfits and being superheroes and villains is the catch for this TV endeavor.  It works just don't take it seriously and enjoy the ride. Show has a nice car in it!
Adam West and Frank Goshin RIP both take on roles on this early 2000's TV show as well as some other familiar actors doing their part in a Corman enterprise.
The show is a guilty pleasure at best but what can you say we all have our guilty pleasures. Harmless fun to be had.",1507766400,2,692,4.0510948905109485

7994166,3,B00009WVTJ,"""Black Scorpion"" is campy.
So campy and so over the top that - like the old ""Batman"" television series starring Adam West - this short-lived television show featuring a female superhero is just fun to watch.
In fact, you could probably call it ""Batman With Boobs"" and not be far off the mark. The reason: Just like that Sixties staple, ""Black Scorpion"" features costumed crime fighters, costumed (and outrageous) villains, and bumbling cops who desperately need her help to curb crime. In addition, our costumed heroine drives a souped-up car that's a cross between the Batmobile and K.I.T.T. - the Trans-Am from ""Knight Rider."" On top of all that, West appears as a villain (Breathtaker) in one of the episodes and Frank Gorshin - who played The Riddler on the old Batman series - does as well.
Oh, and there are boobs; lots and lots of boobs. Black Scorpion and her female enemies display an impressive amount of cleavage throughout the series.
When she's not racing around the city in her Scorpionmobile, Black Scorpion is police detective Darcy Walker, the daughter of a cop who went ""down in the line."" When his killer goes free, Darcy decides to take the law into her own hands and begins cruising the streets at night dealing out justice in her own way. This brings her to the attention of the police, in particular Det. Steve Rafferty, who is determined to unmask her and bring her to justice. Darcy crushes on him but he wants to keep their relationship ""professional,"" which frustrates her to no end. On top of that, she suspects that he has his own crush - on Black Scorpion - even though he's sworn to arrest her.
That's kinda weird when you think about it.
As I said, this is a show that's fun to watch but only in small doses.
It's not - at least for me - a show that invites binge watching. The acting is nothing to write home about, the special effects are amateurish, and the scripts are outlandish.
The verdict: A campy, often outrageous show worth 3.5 stars.",1460419200,3,1977,4.619318181818182
