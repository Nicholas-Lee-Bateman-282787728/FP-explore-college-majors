8432338,3,B004K4FUCU,Ahh would have liked to see the 8-disc versions of both WS redone on Blu-ray!,1479427200,,77,4.2
8432339,4,B004K4FUCU,Good official films of both World Series seasons. Great for any Red Sox fan. Blue Ray transfer not perfect but decent for price.,1358726400,,128,4.608695652173913
8432340,3,B004K4FUCU,"Well I can't say I hate this, but I feel like the blu-ray could definitely have more. The blu-ray includes and is limited to only the 2004 and 2007 World Series films. Don't get me wrong, I think the World Series films are great and enjoy them very much but I feel like the blu-ray is a little bare and is just an attempt to make more money. I thought maybe this would be a new documentary or something but its only two World Series films. If you don't own the 04 or 07 World Series films or if you're a diehard Red Sox fan (which btw i am not, i am a diehard Yankees fan) than maybe I would recommend this to you.",1355356800,,614,3.9596774193548385
8432341,1,B004K4FUCU,This is just both 2004 and 2007 World Series DVDs crammed onto a blu-ray disc and poorly up-scaled to 1080i.  There is nothing new.,1316908800,7,131,4.458333333333333
8432342,5,B004K4FUCU,"Figures the first review has to be from a blow hard Yankee's fan..  Of course the Yankee's are always around, they watch the all star game, then buy just about every player every year.. and continue to ruin baseball.

Boston took 2 titles in the past 10 years despite this.. so GO SOX.. Decade of Champions!",1298678400,7,307,4.464285714285714
