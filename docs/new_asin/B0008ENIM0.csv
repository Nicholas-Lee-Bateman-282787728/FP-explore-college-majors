8055719,2,B0008ENIM0,My sweetheart and I love B movies but these look as if someone took a camcorder and shot it. It's corny and unbelievable. There is maybe one okay movie but you have to wade through too much nonsense and boredom. I am a horror lover but these are just silly.,1259884800,,257,4.16

The DRENCHED IN BLOOD 4 Movie Pack is comprised of fairly recent low-budget indie films.

CONTENTS:

DEVIL MOON-- By a strange twist of fate, a man and the office supervisor who fired him end up together in a woodland setting, where they are both pursued by a serial killer.

Once upon a time we barely survived the Killer Tomatoes. Now meet the menacing mushrooms of FUNGICIDE..... Deadly 'shrooms wander the woodlands and attack and kill people staying at a nearby B&B, but no one knows why! Director Dave Wascavage and four of his family members appear in this silly indie film.

GOREGOYLES is a two-fer. The first story, ""The Holy Terror!,"" is about a man possessed by a demon who is being pursued by both the Church and Satanists. ""Berzerkers!"" is the story of a town overrun by zombies and the group of people hiding from them in the woods. Let's hope they don't run into any mushrooms....

TALES OF TERROR-- Dr. Shock introduces four stories:
""The Town That Loved Pizza"" - Residents die after two new pizzeria owners come to town.
""The Garden Tool Murders"" - Mayhem breaks out prior to the Cherry Festival.
""Demons Day"" - Satan's cloning leads to a battle in Hell.
""Bullet For A Vampire"" - A story of murder, retribution and immortality.
