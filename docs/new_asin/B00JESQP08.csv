8650370,5,B00JESQP08,"This is a collection of old films about the concerns of Americans related to the atomic bomb in the 1950s. The films are not the quality we expect today, but for those of us who are interested in the history of science, watching these old films was very educational. They are now of much interest because of North Korea and Iran, both countries that are very close to having a bomb. We look back and think ""what did American unleash on the world"" by our science?? Some of those working on the bomb project were afraid this would happen, and it did. Now we do have a big problem. I found this bit of science history very enlightening. If we could only put the bomb back in the bottle, but it is too late now.",1516665600,,707,4.2444444444444445

8650372,2,B00JESQP08,"This movie is a Rip-Off. All of what is in this movie are bits and pieces about some of how the atom bomb was developed and some of the work that was done on this bomb in the early 50's. So unless you are interested in nothing much of anything --- Don't waste your money, & I'm sorry that I did.",1426896000,,295,3.8524590163934427
