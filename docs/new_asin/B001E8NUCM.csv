3546970,5,B001E8NUCM,"This movie is absolutley one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long time.  It is a feel good movie about one of the best saloons in NYC during the Golden Age.  From playing pranks on Jackie Gleason to having a full blown fight with Joe DiMaggio (Toots called her a ""whore""), Toots Shor was an unbelievable man with a personality we would all be envious of.

His saloon was THE place to be back in the 50's and 60's. No matter who you were, you were always welcome. NO velvet ropes at Toots, everyone was VIP!

Buy this DVD today and see some amazing interviews with legends like Whitey Ford and Frank Gifford. YOu won't be disappointed!",1230249600,5,645,4.35
3546971,5,B001E8NUCM,"This movie takes you back to the New York's golden age, when women got thier hair done to go out to dinner and men wore suits to the go see the Dodger's play.  In the middle of it all was Toots Shore, restaurant owner and friend of many, if you had a dollar you could go ot Toots and have a drink.  My grandparents and parents told me of the great times they had there, and after seeing the film, I only wish I could've been there with them.....",1222992000,10,445,3.9887640449438204
3546972,5,B001E8NUCM,"Toots Shor thought he had the greatest life in the world for most of his run, being a ""saloonkeeper"" in New York.  His granddaughter's loving, but not blinded, tribute of a documentary shows the man through interviews with those who knew him well.  Those on-camera recollections bring back a New York that is long gone, even though it was only 40 and 50-odd years ago.  To judge by the interviews, it was a time when show business, news, sports and criminal celebrities mingled in restaurants with Joe Subway.  And Shor hosted them all.  That era, many of these people, and a good number of the buildings are no more, preserved only in works like these.

Toots sneaked in and out of New York theaters in a very short run, but if it surfaces near you, and you are interested in one of New York's gone eras, it's a fine, funny and loving tribute.",1200787200,4,844,4.483660130718954
3546973,5,B001E8NUCM,"Wonderful glimpse into the New York City lifestyle and sports world of the 50's and 60's.  Great recent interviews w/ notable personalities who witnessed the fun times surroundingt this ""happening"" watering- hole or tavern run by Toots Shor.  A must -have for anyone wanting to get a peak of the Rat Pack attitude era.  You will not be disappointed.  Fantastic video archives and still photos.",1434326400,,393,5.0
3546974,5,B001E8NUCM,"A brilliant documentary which is perfect in its sense of timing about a man who personified and now departed era of Manhattan int he 1940s through 70s. A story of the city as well as the ""saloonkeeper"".",1433721600,,202,4.486486486486487

3546976,5,B001E8NUCM,"I could watch this over and over.  Loved everything about it.  The only thing I didn't like is that I didn't want it to end.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.  It will make you wish you could live it.",1308960000,2,195,3.8

3546979,5,B001E8NUCM,"This is one of the finest documentaries ever. It is in the classic class and anyone whoever hung-out at a fun lounge/restaurant that also catered to show biz and sports stars will see themselves reflected. I would have loved dropping into Toots Shor's place in its 40's and 50's heydays. No need to dream about it because Toot's great saloon has reopened forever on this DVD. See Jackie Gleason lying drunk on the floor. Walter Cronkite tells about Toots challenging Gleason to a foot race around the block. See DiMaggio and Monroe, Whitey Ford, Mantle, Berra, underworld and political figures. Even US Presidents dropped by. The narration and story are unfolding fun throughout the hour-plus. When it's over you are enriched by the memory of a huge man who loved people, gave of himself to all and was the super host for decades. There may never be another like him. Hail, Toots!",1268697600,,880,4.796052631578948
3546980,5,B001E8NUCM,"The film captures the life and times of a singular personality, Toots Shor. If you lived through his times or want to learn about life in New York City especially in the '50's, this film is an excellent way to view it through the lens of a riveting story.
Having seen it once before, I bought 5 copies, so my wife and I could give one each to our our four children for the recent holidays. We kept one for our own viewing and for sharing with friends (which we did just three weeks ago).",1264550400,,487,4.136842105263158
3546981,5,B001E8NUCM,"I first heard about Toots Shors place in Frank Gifford's book 17 years ago. This is a very well done documentuary that can be viewed a number of times and shared with others. The first copy I purchased was loaned out and never returned, so I bought another.",1263254400,,257,4.375
3546982,5,B001E8NUCM,"Young and old will love this movie and experience the life of Toots Shor.  There is no question that his saloon was the ""it"" place in New York City and helped shaped an era.  The photos are amazing and the stories and tales captivate viewers.  The director, Kristi Jacobson did an exceptional job sharing his life.  I highly recommend this film!",1231027200,10,345,4.60655737704918
8297106,4,B001E8NUCM,"A very good documentary. Sadly I think this profile of Toots Shor was pulled together a bit to late, because there were very few people still around who could remember that immemorial time and that iconic personality with any real clarity.  Practically everyone interviewed in the piece had already crossed over. They obviously loved remembering it with realism and compassion. But like Toots himself, everything just seemed to stop in the middle. He didn't seem to know how to finish or where everything had suddenly gone. (And neither did this film.) It's OK, because in its own sad sweet incomplete way, it seemed even more poignant in the process.",1516147200,,651,4.972477064220183

I got it from discovering Toots on What's my Line appearances (on youtube) and I wanted a peek further into that time period, long gone.

8297110,5,B001E8NUCM,"Toots was a terrific documentary that captured an interesting period of American history, and particularly New York, personified by a larger than life personality.  Even though he was family, Kristi Jacobson didn't flinch and Toots was revealed, warts and all. Well constructed, entertaining, I recommend it.",1457481600,,308,5.695652173913044

8297112,2,B001E8NUCM,Unfortunately the movie is a documentary ... boring after 10 minutes into it.  The Amazon trailer is misleading ... I thought it was a movie with actors.  Will read the reviews of Amazon movies more carefully in the future.,1446940800,,223,4.6923076923076925
