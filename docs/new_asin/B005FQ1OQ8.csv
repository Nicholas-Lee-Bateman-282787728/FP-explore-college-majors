4684136,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"The boxset is esential for all of those who call David Tennant ""My Doctor"", for he certainly is mine in the longest running sci-fi series of all time.  I do have a straw to pick, a few weeks ago, it was listed at $139.99 today, when I was going to pre-order it, it has been bumped up 40 dollars fo $179.99!  I bought ""Torchwood: The Complete UK Series here for $102.00 dollars.  Two days later I see it listed for $86.99!!!  I will wait to order this set when the price comes down as it did for Torchwood.

Update:  October 11, 2011

I pre-ordered it, did not cancel my pre-order and was very happy that the price dropped to $105.00.  It's $104.00 today, but I got it delivered today and it truly is the best DVD release I have ever purchased.  Yes, it's not available in blu-ray, though it probably will... in 5 years.  The BBC definetly outdid itself with this release.  A massive bargain at $105.00.  It is in a coffee table book-shape, and a must for all Doctor Who fans.  Absolutely stunning. Essential.",1313884800,11,1008,4.383783783783784
4684137,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I am very surprised BBC took the time to produce a set just for David Tennant but none is more deserving. He is by far the most entertaining of all the Doctors even the overrated (sacrilege, I know) Tom Baker. David was the embodiment of that character and he is what all future Doctors will be judged by. It's ok, Matt Smith grows on you. He is the one I show newcomers who are a hesitant for such a scifi show and has turned so many who have said, ""that looks so stupid"" to "" wow, this is pretty d**** good!"" My only complaint is that all the seasons aren't available on Blu-ray. But if you've never seen it...buy this. If you've seen every episode..buy this. He's that good. Please enjoy the wonderfully overhyper, fasttalking, Sherlock Holmes trenchcoat wearing, 3D glasses sporting, Banana Daquari inventing, always entertaining 10th Doctor. And if anyone asks tell them David Tennant is your Doctor.",1312502400,16,905,4.6625
4684138,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Finally got my set after eyeing it for a couple of months.  Now that the set is no longer available it's insanely expensive everywhere!  I did not want to spend too much money on it after reading so many terrible reviews about the packaging, so I waited until I found a seller with a more reasonable price.  Now that I have the set I am SO pleased with it!  It's absolutely beautiful!  I'm glad that I waited and didn't spend $300+ on it... but I definitely do not regret the decision to buy it!  David Tennant is my favorite Doctor and so I needed to have a set specifically devoted just to him!  This is the perfect set for that! The artwork is simply gorgeous!  I love the coffee table book look of it. I like to keep it out just so I can stare at it!

I gave this product 5 stars because I think it's gorgeous and I knew exactly what I was getting into when I decided to purchase it because so many other reviewers before had warned me about the packaging.  I had hoped that maybe I'd be a lucky one and not have issues with it... It really wasn't too bad in the end.  Most of the discs came out without any trouble, but there were several that I had to give a good tug and wiggle to get out.  I'm still working my way through watching the enter set, so I haven't been able to test every disc yet.  But the ones that I have watched have been fine.  There was a slight blip on one where it jumped from one scene to the next and skipped about 5 seconds ahead, but aside from that everything seems to be in good working order.  A few of the discs did receive some light surface scratches while being removed from the sleeves but nothing major, so I'm hopeful that they will all continue to work perfectly.

I did take everyone's advice though and have chosen to store the discs in a separate cloth CD pouch so that I don't have to run the risk of damaging them anymore.  I wasn't going to do that because I'd really like to be able to keep them all in the book, but it's all so wonderful that I really don't want to risk damaging it.  It's a small price to pay for such a beautiful collection.  I'd recommend this set to anyone who's a Doctor Who fan and a David Tennant fan, but I would definitely recommend getting a separate pouch for the discs so that they will be kept safe for a long time to come.  Enjoy!",1419379200,,2312,4.106904231625835
4684139,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I LOVE doctor who. This was a super set for the series!!

I just wish they would have arranged the CDs differently since they are difficult to remove from the cardboard. I ended up putting all the disks in disk sleeves apart from the box.",1417564800,,238,4.288888888888889

Except... the packaging is rough on the discs. Thats a BAD thing. Buy it on a deal, but TREAT WITH CARE",1387238400,,158,4.482758620689655
4684154,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I love Doctor Who and as I grew up after it was off the air, besides the casual rerun sic fi channels would show and after such a short season with 9, I really enjoyed the series when the beautifully handsome and talented David Tennant took over as the doctor.
This was a birthday present I purchased for myself and I can tell you... Money well spent. My favorite doctor, all his seasons and ALL THE EXTRAS!!!",1386892800,,409,4.324675324675325

4684156,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"For any whovian, diehard whatever you like to call yourself Doctor Who fan esp a Tennant fan=). This set is amazing! I know it not Blu Ray and i wish it was but it still looks great. The book is so beautiful the artwork on the first page alone is breathtaking. There are 26 dvds. So much extra stuff its amazing. From the cartoon to the videos diaries. I got when the price was a little under a hundred but even at this price it's still worth it. I saw some complaints that the dvds get scratched the way they are packaged. I've watched this set I hate to say at least five times and I have no scratches. Like anything you value you treat it with care. I like the way it package. So before this becomes harder to get the price keeps going up because right now this is the lowest i've seen it in a while I've seen listed for as much as 600.00 I would grab it. It's worth every penny. I plan on buying the new blu ray set with seasons 1-7 and I am sure it still will not have no where near as much as this does or the gorgeous artwork. I love a  great box set that as more than than dics in the smallest package as possible. I'm a collector so i love the extras. Enjoy for those who get it! and Shipping was quick packaged was well, to protect the set.",1382140800,,1250,3.9800796812749004
4684157,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"David Tennant is by far one of the best ""Doctors"" I have seen, and I've been watching Doctor Who since I was little.  This even includes the short lived animated series.

I am so excited about this purchase.",1376524800,,360,4.3088235294117645
4684162,2,B005FQ1OQ8,This was packaged beautiful but 13 of the 26 discs did and do not play this pissed me off because of the price you would expect it to be checked by quality control I have never had this trouble with anything from amazon before,1376092800,2,226,4.159090909090909
4684163,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I know I was scared because of all the packaging reviews, so I took their advice and got a book to store them in.

Also the CD's have the play all capability that I just love.  Hate the ones where you have to select every episode by hand.  A super value also if you were to price the seasons separately and then you wouldnt get the specials....this was a great buy!,1374969600,,388,4.133333333333334
4684166,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"David Tennant's Number Ten quickly became a fan fave, even as the show finally got its long-overdue props on the American side of the pond.  Ten definitely turned the ladies' heads, but as ever the show will carry on with the endless incarnations of the Doctor.

I caught a lucky break and got it at about half listed price.  Despite direst warnings about packaging troubles I took a leap of faith, but warned the recipient of same.  She had no such troubles, but took great care when initially removing the discs from packaging; I know it to be among her most favored possessions.

If you love the show and can get a good price, indulge yourself.  The look on your face will be worth it.",1374710400,2,688,4.464

4684168,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"The packaging is very cool. I also did not have the problem with removing the discs that a lot of people seemed to have. They could have worked on that issue a bit, I'll admit, but all I have to do is take a bit of care when removing each one.",1374451200,,243,3.784313725490196
4684169,2,B005FQ1OQ8,"As has been mentioned before, the reason I am returning is because half the disks have scratches and/or packing adhesive on the playing side. Impossible to replace just some of the disks I am told, so everything goes back and I will order the individual seasons.  A real shame. About six disks had to have the covering cardboard pulled apart just to get them out. Sloppy execution.

Why did I order this if I thought there might be a problem? Because some reviewers had no packaging issues and I was hoping for the same experience.

As for the content, I have seen the Tennant years and love them and would give them a 5 star.",1374019200,,626,4.426086956521739
4684170,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"I ordered this in spite of the warnings about the product packaging because DAVID TENNANT OMFG SQUEEEE!!! And when it arrived, in good time and in good condition, the thing was definitely designed poorly.  I believe ""WTF"" was my first reaction.

The DVDs are fine, mind you, and once I figured out WHERE the DVDs were actually located, all is good as long as you're careful. (Hint: The ""pages"" have two DVDs on BOTH sides.  It took me a while to figure that out, and I have three college degrees, ferkryinoutloud.) But yeah, whoever designed this packaging really needs to buy one him/herself and see how difficult it is to get the DVDs out.  It's just like, the heck???",1373500800,,670,4.605042016806722

I grew to love David during his first episode the Christmas Invasion.  It was like Rose I was unsure about him at first, but then as the episode when on.... He became one of the good awesome Doctors.",1373241600,,375,4.420289855072464
4684172,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"Okay, so yes, bad design, but if your gentle and slow and don't initially force them all out and just be patient, they do come out unscratched!!! The Seasons themselves are freaking awesome :). I would advise you put the dvds in something else after you pull them out because you will scratch them if you keep pulling them out and forcing them back into the slots.",1372723200,,364,4.447761194029851
4684173,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I was and am excited to have this David Tennant Collection, but upon close review of each of the discs, there were several that had minor smudges or scratches despite very carefully removing them. I'm doubting that it will affect their playing on the DVD player, but definitely invest in a case to put the discs in for better protection. The packaging is still very neat to look at and the price point was good so overall I am satisfied with this purchase. It's just too bad they don't come up with a better way to protect the discs inside the really cool packaging!",1371859200,,566,4.451923076923077
4684174,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"You're a jerk if you don't buy this. Anyone on this planet who doesn't buy this should leave the planet because you are no longer welcome. When you *do* buy it, just be VERY CAREFUL taking the DVDs out of there pockets and they will be fine (I recommend opening up the mouth of the pockets as wide as you can!). But it's really a great set with lots of fun little extras and tons of Tennant.",1371600000,,391,4.090909090909091
4684175,1,B005FQ1OQ8,"Pros: This low rating has nothing to do with the actual content. The David Tenant collection is awesome.

Cons: Unfortunately some marketing dweeb had the brilliant (not!) idea of creating a coffee table book out of this set. The packaging of the disks is atrocious. On opening this package, there were not less than 4 disks damaged badly enough to be unplayable including two that literally had gouges on them (with little plastic bits falling off) from the insertion equipment. Even should you follow the recommendations of others to separate the pages, my guess is that some of you will still suffer from damaged disks. In the received configuration, you will damage the disks with every insertion or removal. Due to it's coffee table book format, this set will also not fit in standard size disk storage cabinets.

Bottom Line: This set is NOT RECOMMENDED. This is a great set at a better price than buying separately. Unfortunately, it can't be recommended due to the the worst disk destroying packaging ever created.",1371340800,,1022,4.936046511627907
4684176,1,B005FQ1OQ8,"Don't get me wrong here, I LOVE the Doctor.  BUT...Like all the other bad reviews, 21 out of the 26 discs had scratches on them.  Some are so severe I highly doubt they will play, but until I can get thru them all, who knows.  Hopefully I can return this if I do find any that are unplayable.  I have never bought a brand new dvd that had scratches on it!  How are they continuing to sell something with such a big flaw?!",1370304000,,421,4.024096385542169
4684177,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I love the front of the box set & LOVE the show, but the person that designed the places to fit the dvds needs to be FIRED, I bought this when amazon had it for $69.99, total amazing deal, its the best deal for seasons 2-4 and all the specials, so much cheaper then buying them all separate, when this is in stock you better grab it or you will be sad if you don't !",1370044800,,366,3.8289473684210527
4684178,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"As many other people have noted, this series is excellent, no complaints about that; the only real complaint about this item is the packaging.  Unless they've changed the packing since I ordered this, the discs are difficult to pull out and put back in without the danger of scratching the discs.  You need to be very careful when removing the discs.  The book design is neat, but ineffective.  Still, the series is so great, I've given the product five stars anyway, and I would highly recommend you buy this set and just deal with the bad packaging.  We just bought a cheapie DVD binder and we keep the discs there, and we put the outside box on display, because it really is neat-looking, with collages and artwork and all that fun stuff.  Just keep your discs stored separately and you'll be fine.",1367971200,,801,4.605633802816901
4684179,5,B005FQ1OQ8,After getting into Doctor Who last Summer. I decided I wanted to own the series. This was a great way to get a huge chunk of the modern series in one swoop. The one issue that I had read about on here was that the discs got scratched as they came out of the sleeves because the sleeves were too tight. I actually cut the sleeves on the left and right and removed the discs and put them into a DVD wallet. Well worth the price.,1366675200,2,426,3.9651162790697674
4684180,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"This set is worth every cent that you'll spend on it. It includes everything that David Tennant did while on the show. It has all the disks from series 2,3,4, the TV movies, the two animated episodes, and a plethora of special features. Now the only reason that this set will not get above four stars for me. The set looks beautiful the book like design and the visuals from memorable scenes in the series. The design of how the discs come out is terrible it's way too tight and has the potential to heavily damage to disks. Now when you buy this set be prepared to work hard to properly remove the disks without damaging them. Also Don't reuse the packaging that the disks came in use a dvd disk case so that all the effort that it took to get the disks out isn't wasted.",1365638400,,772,4.258503401360544

4684189,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"So I bought this present for my wife, but secretly it was also for me - since David Tennant is my first doctor and you never forget your first doctor.

Either way, this product is excellent for those of you considering to buy it for yourself or significant other. The artwork and packaging is excellent. I had no trouble taking out the discs, which I know others had mentioned was a problem for them? Perhaps they've fixed this issue? The DVD's play well and have tons of content on them. As the product information states, this set has everything from the David Tennant years and is an excellent choice since buying these separately would probably cost alot more (I got it in a daily deal).

There is no complaint on my end. But if there is something I would request - it would be a Blu-Ray version of this set. And if there already is one, please disregard this comment :)",1357430400,,874,4.422360248447205

All the episodes from season 2-4 (with audio commentary), all the specials, DW Confidential, the animated series, DW at the Proms, Children in Need specials, David Tennant and Billie Piper's video diaries, aaaaaaand I am probably forgetting something, but really-it has everything from 10's run.
  Some people are complaining about the execution and design, I think it's beautiful, and I have had no trouble with the discs. The set comes in what looks like a long, thick book with a plastic sleeve. The discs are inside what would be the pages of the book.
  All in all, it's a great set-can't wait to start adding to my collection.",1356825600,2,734,4.7109375
4684194,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"This is a complete collection, with all the extra episodes. Much more than I thought it would be. Packaging is beautiful. Thick pages of book with two discs in each. Lots of pictures. I bought for my daughter and she loves absolutely loves it.",1356739200,2,243,4.545454545454546
4684195,5,B005FQ1OQ8,Having these seasons all in one package is awesome. David Tennant is the best Doctor! Had a hard time finding all of David Tennants seasons before this came out. It made the perfect christmas present for my husband.,1356566400,,215,4.684210526315789
4684196,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"Like many others, a little disappointed with the packaging.  The plastic outer sleeve has a machining error, leaving a nasty fold where one should not exist.  One of the pages started coming apart just because it was stuck to the adjoining page.

However, for the price?  Unbeatable.  You could go buy plastic cases and print sleeves to go with these discs cheaper than buying the individual seasons.",1356048000,,400,4.91044776119403

Doctor Who: The David Tennant Years 2005 - 2009

It is a wonderful set covering the entire life of David Tennant .What I will list here is the titles of all the DVDs. So everyone will know what is in the collection. As it appears to me everyone writes about the packaging. So here are listings.

That is the list I hope you enjoy them! I found it worth wile to buy this entire collection than individual disks. And be sure to shop around be for you purchase the set. I can highly recommend this set of Dr,Who. Enjoy.",1355184000,4,2366,4.521531100478469
4684198,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I love this set. It is wonderful to have all of Tennant in one beautiful set. My only complaint is the same as most other reviews. The packing is appealing to the eye, but it can cause issues with the discs. I am fortunate and did not receive a set that damaged my discs when I removed them. However, I do have to remove the discs very carefully each time because it just slips into a hard cardboard slot that is pretty tight against the disc. Overall, I am very happy with this set, but think the execution could/should be changed.",1355184000,,532,4.2772277227722775
4684199,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I got this as a gift for my fiance as she loves this Dr Who the most. We didn't have the same issues some other have with removing the discs. Overall, it is a nicely packaged set with a slew of additional material.",1355097600,,214,4.0
4684200,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I would have given 5 stars if it was not for the actual problem of getting the discs out without risking scratching the discs.  For the price asked, this is manufactured in Mexico.",1355011200,,180,4.454545454545454
4684201,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I was a bit worried when I purchased this, due to the other reviews of this products packaging.  But I took a chance, and I am so glad I did.  Once I opened the set, I could see why people were complaning.  The packaging was not designed very well.  It's great if you want to look at the pictures inside, and never play the DVD's.  They were difficult to remove, and with repeated removal, I could see how they would get scratched and damaged very quickly.  Per another review, I purchased a zippered travel DVD folder, and gently removed my discs as soon as the set arrived.  I now store the discs in there, and have had no problem with scratches or damaged DVD's.  They all play fine, and have had no issues.
So, if you love Doctor Who, and/or David Tennant, this set is perfect for you.  The shows are great, and the
DVD extras are worth exploring.  Be gentle when removing the discs, and get yourself something else to store them in. You won't be sorry.",1354924800,9,957,4.325842696629214
4684202,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"If your a fan you've already got it or are planning on getting it. The Deleated scenes make you wish they
had been inserted back in the episodes and the Outtakes were worth the price alone.",1354492800,,189,4.277777777777778
4684203,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Daughter is a avid Dr. Who fan, especially the David Tennant years.  This made for the perfect gift and we've been watching them since birthday!",1354060800,,144,4.76
4684204,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"If you love David Tennant, then how can you not truly love this boxed set.  All episodes and movies with him in it.  Wouldn't  ever have cabin fever with this!  So much to see with all the extras including David & Billie Piper's video diaries, Freema's studio tour, commentaries, deleted scenes & more.  Grab this and have a great time!",1353715200,,336,4.533333333333333
4684205,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Great compilation, quick shipping, husband loves packaging, would recommend to any Dr. Who or David Tenant fan - go ahead & buy it now!",1353456000,,135,4.666666666666667
4684206,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I really like how the box set is put together, and I love having all of David Tennant in one box!!",1353369600,,98,3.7142857142857144
4684207,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"El empaque es maravilloso, el retiro de los discos del mismo sin da&ntilde;arlos es algo complicado. Totalmente recomendado, si bien se debe tener cuidado con los discos.",1353283200,,170,5.333333333333333
4684208,5,B005FQ1OQ8,Very nicely packaged and great to have everything together like this.  I've not had any problem with the packaging. Really happy with my decision to go ahead with the purchase!,1353196800,,176,4.866666666666666
4684209,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"What better way to dream away the upcoming winter months than tucked in with a pot of tea and the complete collection of the best Dr ever, David Tennant!",1353110400,,153,4.310344827586207
4684210,5,B005FQ1OQ8,Purchased for my daughter and she loved it. Great purchase at a great price. Very good bargain we need more like this!,1352937600,,118,4.409090909090909
4684211,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"WOW, this compilation from Doctor Who is amazing! The jacket is more like a cool comic book with beautiful graphics. The ""extra's"" in this set are wonderful and I love the cartoons! Pricing for this was incredibly LOW compared to anywhere else on the net. A truly quality item to have for any collector or lover of Doctor Who, The David Tennant Years!",1352851200,,351,4.587301587301587
4684212,1,B005FQ1OQ8,"This was a great box set and I read reviews saying there was a packaging problem and the disk getting scratched, but the issue was resolved.  Half way through watching the box set, one of the disk was unreadable.  When we looked, there was a big scratch on it.  I am so disappointed, the first time I need to return a product to Amazon.  I really wanted to exchange this box set because we have enjoyed the first half of the disk so much, but it looks like Amazon has pulled the production because of so many reported problems.  The box set was really nice and I don't believe it was the design that damaged the disk because of the way scratch was arched and quite large.",1352678400,,671,4.251968503937008
4684213,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I was extremely hesitant to get this because of how negative people were towards the way the discs are in the box set. By the sounds of it the discs get horribly ruined from taking them out. I actually find it to not be nearly as bad as they make it sound. Yes SOME of the discs stick, but honestly isn't that to be expected of anything? I found that the ones that stick are the ones placed on the binding side. The reason for that is just because in shipping its shut tight, but once you get it open it does get better. There were a couple that were a bit scratched, but then again I was so excited getting them out I feel that may have been my fault. One disc did get cracked sadly (it works fine though) but I don't blame that on the box/book that it was in. I just blame that on the way it transported. (I was home when the guy dropped it off and trust me, he wasn't gentle.) So I don't think the box is to blame. I have bought five dvds online prior to this and 2 of them are not broken in anyway (only the cases on the other three were broken). It wasn't because their case wasn't built right, it was because the delivary wasn't the best. Accidents happen, these are the risks of ordering online.

As for the set its self, it is absolutely fantastic! The pictures and design of the book or just amazing! The set comes with all sorts of extras and I love going back and watching the episodes! Trust me, this is completely worth it. I have no regrets whats so ever of buying this, and I highly recommend it to others! Doctor who fans will really enjoy this and its a perfect set to get for the 10th doctor (who was my first doctor and is definitely my favorite) Now I rated it four just because of the transport of it. Not that its the products or amazons fault but I'm just grumpy that they cracked my disc -_- (im allowed to be annoyed by that)",1352592000,,1850,4.082417582417582
4684214,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"Beautiful case, too bad it's not wise to store your DVD's in it as every time you remove or store a disk you run the risk of scratching it.  We were able to safely removed each disk by holding the page down and then lifting the disk towards us as we slide it out.  One disk came with few squiggly scratches, clearly predating the packaging (luckily they didn't effect play), plus two very tiny dots of glue on the play surface (which we gently removed), but all the other disk look fine.  Because of the cardboard slip case, and TIGHT DVD fit, we ordered plastic cases to store the disk in.  You can find ones of various capacities on Amazon, but read the reviews carefully, as the large capacity black ones tend to be brittle.  Got this as a Gold Box deal, awesome.

4684216,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"The packaging for the 26 DVD collection is just beautiful. Yes, the DVDs fit very snugly in the photo-covered cardboard pages of the coffee-table style book. Having read of this in other reviews I carefully removed all the DVDs and put them in a separate case. This will help to keep the case/book in better condition to enjoy the photo collection. Each DVD is well labeled with Disc number, Series number and names of each episode title. I wish more DVD collections would do as well. (2012/11/05)",1352073600,,497,4.724137931034483
4684217,3,B005FQ1OQ8,I purchased this item as a Christmas gift so all I can do is hope for the best. Good value if the product is in good condition. I gave it 3 stars for value and quick shipping. Will update when the DVD's can be viewed for quality.,1351555200,,229,3.893617021276596
4684218,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Cool box too.  Great set, includes the specials. Delivered promtly.  This was gift for my 18 year old son who was very impressed.",1351036800,,129,4.565217391304348
4684219,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I honestly want to love this collection.  Getting the entire David Tennant run as The Doctor in one, relatively, low price set is great, and the packaging looks spectacular.  But the packaging itself is where the problem lies.  It is very hard to get disks out, and back in again.  The slots are just a little too tight.  I haven't had the scratching problem that others have reported, but I can understand how it could happen.  I luckily have a number of multi-disk cases that I can use for this collection to replace the spectacular but flawed book that the disks come in, but I really wish I didn't have to use them for this.  With that said, this would be a five star review if it weren't for the packaging.  David Tennant's run as The Doctor was spectacular, and if you don't already have it on DVD this is a great way to get it for about half the price of the individual seasons.  I would invest in some multi-disk cases, which you can get on Amazon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/right-here/dp/B001KMWOJ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">right here</a>, but I honestly think this set is worth it.",1351036800,,1141,4.9319371727748695
4684220,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Almost every episode is wonderful. Great set if you're a true Dr. Who Fan. If you are not a fan, you will be after you watch a few episodes. I introduced this set to 3 people who didn't watch Dr. Who and now we are watching this set again.",1350950400,,239,3.8979591836734695
4684221,5,B005FQ1OQ8,This is a really great collection of shows and extras that any Doctor Who / David Tennant fan would just love.  There are literally hours of extras and interviews that take you behind the scenes and all of the specials and movies are there too.  Great package deal!!!,1350950400,,267,4.541666666666667
4684222,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Saw other reviews about how bad this set was and I was prepared for the worst but I have not yet been disappointed, not even a little.

Packaging and arrangement of the CD's is tight, but obvious and easy to avoid slipping Cd's. More important is that the set includes all the episodes including little gems like the DR.WHO at the Proms recording  right after the end of season 4 (another one was done at the end of season 5 I believe)

All in all an excellent collection, lots of outtakes, all the specials and all the bits that don't always make it onto BBCAmerica for those of us in the states.

Definite heads up, these are the UN-edited versions that I believe air in the UK, I've seen a few when BBCA chooses to run them, but the edited bits either consist of various fill that helps the story along but are not critical, either way more of the 10th Dr. is always good.",1350950400,,875,4.284848484848485
4684223,5,B005FQ1OQ8,A very good buy. Loved the case and how the discs were sorted. All of the episodes are displayed wonderfully and subtitles are available - very convenient for some of us!,1350864000,,170,4.516129032258065
4684224,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I'm so glad this compilation exists! It's completely worth the money. Not only does it include all the episodes but also all the confidentials, video diaries, specials, and the DW animation. The packaging was organized and very attractive. The only thing is the plastic casing on the outside. Sliding the set in and out of the plastic tends to tear at the corners. But really, that's no problem. It's everything clever and appealing you expect from Doctor Who!",1350864000,,460,4.910256410256411
4684225,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Fast shipping, It was sent right out. Great condition. Beautiful pictures with each flip of the ""book"". I love the way they put pictures of such essential scenes in it. It is a real collector's item!! Brilliant! Fantastic! Even a Dalek wouldn't exterminate this awesomeness!",1350777600,,274,5.111111111111111
4684226,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"This set is amazing. If the 10th doctor is your favorite you need this set. It's larger than the average DVD case so storage may be tricky, but the case has good graphics.",1350777600,,171,4.212121212121212
4684227,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I was fortunate that my wife forwarded me a Deal of the Day link for this collection.

I love Doctor Who and have been meaning to pick up the series for my collection, but I hadn't gotten around to it yet.  David was a great Doctor, and picking up the collection of all his series and the specials was just, well, awesome!  Haven't had a chance to watch yet, but looking forward to watching and checking out all the special features.

Only downside - the format is the size of a small coffee table book, so it doesn't fit in the shelving with the other DVDs and BluRays that we own.  But this is a small pain compared to the merits of getting seasons 2,3,4 and the specials at one time.",1350777600,,686,4.206106870229007
4684228,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"The content of the DVD's is perfect.  The only drawback is the packaging.  Getting the DVD's out was a challenge, but I was able to do so without terribly scratching the discs.  I used a DVD scratch remover to get rid of the scratches on the discs in question.  I just store the DVD's in another case now.  The book design is nice with its pictures and things, but the DVD storage was terribly lacking.  That is the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars.",1350777600,,462,4.252873563218391
4684229,5,B005FQ1OQ8,It contains everything it says in the description and provides hours and hours of fun. I recommend this to any Whovian. Great buy.,1350777600,,130,4.695652173913044
4684230,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"Not thrilled with the difficult cardboard packaging.  Discs slide into very tight slots and I'm not sure whether the discs will resist scratching over the long term.  But, that being said, I got it for a great price and I am happy to have the set.  Wish they would put out the earlier years in more reasonable sets.",1350777600,,315,4.396551724137931

4684232,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"This Box Set really receives 10 out of 5 stars!

  I am sitting here BAFFLED at all these negative reviews!!!  Honestly people! If you are incapable of removing these discs from this amazing packaging, then I hate to see the rest of your collection.  There is nothing wrong with the packaging.  In fact, it is one of the most amazing presentations and packing for a series I have ever seen.  The DVD's slide out effortlessly; without scratching or fingerprints.  They return to the original place just as easily.  I cannot stress how beautiful this presentation is.  It adorns my shelf as a crown jewel of box sets.

  Then, when it comes to content, you cannot ask for more a complete set.  If there is anything I hate, it's omission from one box set to another, forcing you to buy multiple.  This is NOT the case.  It contains just what it advertises:  The COMPLETE David Tennant Years.  Nothing is missing.  All specials, all video diaries, outtakes, commentaries, animated, Telethon special, etc.  This is a ""complete-ist's"" DREAM COME TRUE!!!

  Thank you BBC for compiling and selling this Box Set just as it is!  I HIGHLY recommend anyone who is interested, do not hesitate to purchase.  It is worth every penny to a true fan.",1350691200,2,1233,4.702830188679245
4684233,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"This is a great deal if you do not have any of the Tenth Doctor's dvd sets, except the case the dvds were put in. Most of the discs have scratches but so far they seem to play fine. I wish they made a better case for it though even though the art in the book looks great.",1350691200,,271,3.689655172413793
4684234,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"After reading reviews I was skeptical about buying this product, but the price was too good to pass it by. So glad I did! I'm a new fan to Doctor Who and I love David Tennant as the Doctor. This is a great keepsake for David Tennant fans. Beautifully done.  The only problem is getting the dvd's out of the sleeves without scratching them, very tight. I have minor scratches on some of mine, not all and it hasn't affected them being played. Once you (carefully) remove them, you should put them in a separate dvd holder (just to prevent scratching). Well worth the money.",1350604800,,572,4.447619047619048
4684235,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I just got my DVDs in the mail about a half an hour ago so I can't report anything about the content yet (aside from knowing that s2-4.5 are freaking awesome) but I think they might have changed the packaging? Maybe. I'd already read all the annoyed reviews  from people who ended up damaging their discs trying to get them out, but I had no such issues. Maybe the review section is just hearing from the discontented few, but I can't really see how the current design (which is gorgeous, btw) would cause any issues with removal. They all slid out very smoothly, and stayed snug in place when reinserted. I'm sorry other people had bad experiences, though. Maybe I was just lucky. Or maybe they were just unlucky.",1350518400,2,714,4.534883720930233

4684238,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"Not sure if they fixed the packaging or everyone is just ""special"". I had no problems removing or putting any of the discs back in their spots. It looks the same as in all the pics that people complain about. Maybe they made them a bit looser, or tighter. I don't know as my discs slide in and out no problem.

4684240,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"My DVD set just came in about an hour ago. I echo everything these reviews have laid out- the price per series cost is awesome, the content is awesome, and the packaging is beautiful.

That is the only thing the packaging has going for it.

The DVDs are packed so tightly in some of the pages that it feels as though they may be glued in there. I was fortunate enough(if it could be called fortunate) to only have 1 disc get scratched and 1 get a minor ""dig"". One review did mention removing some from the front and back to help in the middle and it did help. As soon as the one disc came out scratched I went to the back and pulled out some in the back and the middle did get a lot better. Nothing I see in the box explains why that would help but it does.

Basically each of the season box sets plus specials sets thrown together into one grand DVD novel. The set opens just like a book with overly thick, art laden pages that hold the 26 discs. The only issue, which has been mentioned in other reviews, is how the discs slide in. They are very tight and sorta feels like a scratch is imminent. However, I own other box sets (Stanley Kubrick Collection, Indiana Jones, Alien Anthology) that have this cardboard disc holding technology and I haven't had problems with scratching or anything else.

HOWEVER, the construction of the set leaves a lot to be desired.  Of the 20some discs, 6 of mine were scratched in either minor ways or bad enough that it actually scratched across the disc and through the central ring.  A few of the scratched discs also had glue on them.  Thanks to Amazon, I'm returning this set for a replacement- hopefully better luck, because it appears that the set has good sets available, but its luck of the draw (and I always have bad luck).

I know the bulk of Tennant's episodes were not filmed in high def, but the last of the specials were. When they marketed those specials they really pushed that high def for those of us who have invested. Seems like it would have been a no brainer here.....The set is already 26 discs so anyone interested in getting into it is going to commit to a certain price point. So, why NOT at least include both the standard AND high definition versions of those last couple of discs. Considering everything, it really wouldn't have affected the price much. Including everything would have helped.....and at this price, shouldn't have effected anything. For THIS much money, I am ok just streaming the episodes.",1348012800,,791,4.954887218045113

He made us watch this entire set and if we fell asleep (which happened every five minutes or so) eugene would pinch us and tell us we were missing the best part.

They started getting a little stuck in the middle, so I pulled them from the back, and it apparently loosened the packaging, for when I came back to the middle the discs slid right out.

I guess some of the ones they made just weren't made correctly, but not all of them are bad! I'm the proof!
That being said, I love this collection. It's exactly what I wanted after I finished watching all of the David Tennant episodes/specials. Its SUCH a good deal buying it from Amazon considering its usually $200
even at $200 I would have bought this collection
Normally the individual seasons are 40-50 dollars, so the fact that you're getting 3 of the best Doctor Who seasons PLUS the specials PLUS the extras, at $100 it's a steal! Now I can rewatch all of my favorite episodes that kept me glued to the screen over and over again.

4684253,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"Here it is, barely 2/3 of (as of Sept 2012) ""New Who,"" all in one big....er, ""box."" But back to the infamous packaging later.

I've watched all of the original ""Dr Who"" (1963-89) series (okay, ""most,"" since some '60s stories are missing), and the 1996 movie and the 2005/ Eccleston opener series, so comparisons are inevitable. The original series was always struggling with a low budget -- sometimes it really showed, but sometimes the creators made some fabulous efforts with what they had at the time. ""Who"" could also have a kind of camp sensibility about itself, only encouraged by the low budget and performers like Patrick Troughton and Tom Baker. Despite being a time travel show, the ""historicals"" (visits to Earth's past) mostly stopped after the first Doctor (Wlm. Hartnell), concentrating on SF space adventures instead.

By comparison, the new Who seems to have the opposite problems sometimes. Nowadays the show is a little spoiled with visual effects, obsessed w/constant action; filled with wall2wall musical scoring sometimes (and already recycling certain action cues). Still, the writers occasionally overcome this and deliver some really good stories. While Tennant's performance can be a bit spastic at times, he's pretty much got every previously established aspect of the Doctor spot on. Yes, there are return visits from original series characters, but it's not the mindless continuity racket run by John Nathan-Turner in the 1980s.

""Who"" has been through many changes over the years, but it's good to see that the Tennant years has done a decent job of reviving the Who tradition, albiet in a very different form, keeping and losing some of the many good aspects of the original run.

Oh, yes, the packaging. If you decide to risk this box set, you must have/get some disposable gloves to carefully handle the DVDs, and a set of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Pack-Standard-14mm-Black-Quad-4-Disc-DVD-Cases-with-Double-Sided-Flip-Tray-and-Outter-Clear-Sleeve/dp/B008KNDTB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Pack Standard 14mm Black Quad 4 Disc DVD Cases with Double Sided Flip Tray and Outter Clear Sleeve</a>&nbsp;to put the DVDs in.
Work at a table, a smooth, dry surface, have your first DVD case open and ready, and a box of tissues nearby. (This may not be rocket science, but it sure feels like nuclear rod adjustment.)

--For each disc, grab by the edge and pull out...some. It's a pretty tight fit that invites struggle, but patience pays off.

--Pull -- not too hard, not too lightly. Then push back in again. Then pull out, slightly harder. Then in, etc., and the disc Should come out. Some of them will actually come out fairly easily, in only a few pulls; many take more effort.

--Visually inspect the bottom of each disc for scratches and such. For light dust, etc, gently wipe from center out.

--For any disc that has big ugly scratches that prove difficult to play around, you might prepare to ask BBC video for replacement(s) of such disc(s). If more than four discs look really unplayably scratched (this is also why you buy new, not used), then you should just return the set for a refund already and try the separate sets after all.(Aaargh!)

Still, as of this writing, even though some of my discs have weird little suspicious (semi)-(scratches) n' such, so far all have played great without any hitches, as of Sn3, Disc 5. Again, make the careful effort to transfer your discs, and inspect them, and if they have no real scratches, then you're good to go.",1346803200,26,3547,5.187062937062937
4684254,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"I bought this because my favorite Doctor is the Tenth. What better way to celebrate that love than to get this boxset that's full of David Tennant?

The cover art is beautiful, the box is beautiful, and it's just so very beautiful - all of it. However, like everyone else has already said, it is a pain to get the discs out and when you do, you end up scratching some of them (though not to the point that they aren't functionable). I just spent an hour or two using a plastic butter knife to cut open the foam pieces in between each dvd holder and that has made it so much easier to take out the dvds and put them back in. This being said, I have to ignore the fact that the inner sleeves are all slightly mauled and for paying $100, I shouldn't have to put forth this much effort to enjoy my product. However, the look of it all is still very composed and it appears as if nothing was changed to the set.

I also know that other people are just advising interested fans to buy the set, take the discs out, and put them in a separate container. However, I feel like this defeats the function and purpose of this wonderful box set (which should be displayed and shown off), so I set out to do what I did. Maybe if you're lucky, you'll get a set that works. If not, you'll be like me and be slightly frustrated with your purchase.",1346716800,4,1329,4.147286821705427

I did notice some small scratches on the disks caused by sliding in them in and out of the pages so I moved them to an extra CD zipper case I had. It's definitely cheaper than purchasing the three seasons and specials separately (when I bought it the price was about the same as buying two seasons individually), and I really like the packaging despite the lack of utility. If you are considering purchasing at least two of Tennant's seasons, I'd go with this set and get all of his episodes.",1346544000,3,645,4.521367521367521

If you take a razor to that foam tape breaking the piece that holds the center together you can get the disks in and out without damaging them.  It sucks that you have to hack around the packaging to make it usable but other than that it's absolutely beautiful.  I'm very happy with the product.,1344297600,11,551,4.372549019607843

Definitely this is a better option than buying the sets separately. You save money and space and you get a beautiful box set that resembles a Doctor Who book.

4684264,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I'm sure a lot of the reviews already on here are about the show, or the packaging, so I'm going to focus on the details.

Video quality:
Live action episodes: 9/10: Perfect except that sometimes, during the end credits, the text moves so fast that individual letters become garbled. Does not really affect readability; you can still tell what the letters are supposed to be.

Animated episodes: The skill of the animators varies from episode to episode; one in particular seemed to have very stiff and unlifelike character movement. Video compression seems fine.

Audio quality:
Live action episodes: 10/10: No complaints.

Animated episodes: I think one of the episodes must have been recorded with the actors in a very small room. Even when the characters are supposedly in a wide open area, it sounds like they're standing in a narrow hallway or something. Luckily that's just one episode.

Special features:
---Audio commentaries: Listed as special features on the box, the audio commentaries can be found on the dvds' ""setup"" submenus (not the ""special features"" submenus). A few of the commentaries include picture-in-picture video, but the video doesn't add anything - it just shows people sitting at a table as they talk. The commentaries themselves usually consist of two or three people giving ""behind the scenes"" comments and stories, such as a writer explaining the inspiration for a scene, or an actor revealing how a scene was filmed.
---Video diaries: Generally short videos shot by the actors in between filming scenes. Actors complain about the weather, or talk about how long they've been shooting at some location, stuff like that.
---Doctor Who Confidential: Mostly cut-down episodes of the documentary series Doctor Who Confidential. There are, I think, one or two uncut episodes.",1341014400,2,1802,5.178694158075602

When I received it I was mesmerized by its package design (and weight!) I did notice how tightly packed each disc was. Naturally I was worried about scratches and damage but so far I've only had one disc that has issues with and was a loading issue with the coding on the disc itself.

First the good: the DVD set is as complete as can be of the Tennant years.  The book holder itself is gorgeous with beautiful photography inside.  As far as content goes, you couldn't ask for more (well, maybe some liner notes could be added).

Now the bad: it's hit or miss if you get a set that doesn't have DVDs that are cracked, scratched, have glue on them or are nearly impossible to remove from the page sleeves.  At least 6 of the 26 discs in the first set I got had large gashes on them, one had a 1/2"" crack right out of the sleeve and three or four had glue on the disc surface.  Too many of the discs looked in worse shape than rental DVDs and I'm describing discs were right out of the box.  Who designed and packaged this thing?  BBC America should be ashamed of the shoddy quality of this set (too many of the DVDs had rough, notched edges and dodgy top label ink quality to boot).

On the upside, Amazon was prompt in shipping a replacement DVD set that had few if any suspect DVDs.  It appears it's a luck of the draw if you get a good or bad set.  First indicator if you have a good set: ease of removing a DVD from the sleeve.  If it's tough to remove it, you likely have a set that's a disaster.

Book is beautiful but very little thought went into disk accessibility.  It is very difficult to pull the disks out of the pages but I found an easy way to take them out: Take a piece of Scotch tape and apply a small section to the label side of the disk and pull the tape.
When I first got the book, I pulled each disk out and inspected them.  I found some with surface scratches, several with a spot of adhesive, and one with fingerprints and what looked like palmprints(this one had a lot of scratches.)  I gently removed the adhesives and carefully removed its residual smudges using alcohol and Q-tips.  I was able to remove most of the other smudges with alcohol.  I wondered if the scratches and remaining smudges would prevent the disk from playing but they all played without any problems.
Aside from the above stated problems, I love the collection and all the features.
Instead of putting the disks back into the book, I put them into a thin jewel case for easier access...all 26 disks takes only 5 1/4 inch across.",1336780800,13,1296,4.497872340425532

I will be making sure the plastic sleeve stays on the set to keep out dust, and being extra careful to make sure the discs are clean before I put them back in. With that, I don't see there being any problems. The book design of the case is very nice, and the artwork compliments the set very well. Plenty of bonus material, including the animated specials that I didn't know existed. This is one of the few exceptions where the bonus content really is important to me, as Doctor Who is one of my all-time favorite shows.

4684273,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I'll just assume that you are familiar with this incarnation of The Doctor and skip the review to go straight to the box set.
First off, the tightness of the DVD sleeves.  The DVD's are definitely snug in their spaces but we have had no issues getting them out or the sleeves being so tight that they scratch.  It is tight though, so I can easily imagine where some of the reviews focusing on that are coming from.
The quality of the ""book"" (we'll call it) is decent.  I was a bit surprised to see some creases near the binding for a new product but it wasn't bad enough to effect the overall appearance.  The pages are a wonder to look at with stills from the different series' framed and put to a kind of collage.  The episode index is also incorporated into these pages and the result is a very pleasing book to look through and reference.  I've spent a bit of time just looking through the book without even intending to watch anything.
The quality of the construction seems like it might easily get damaged.  It's definitely not a real book binding, this is something that could easily show some wear and tear if not treated with kid gloves.
Concerning the DVD quality, we've only watched a couple of discs but they were great.  It wasn't like a low budget version of the ""real"" series if you bought them individually.

Overall this is an incredible addition to any Dr. Who collection.  We already owned the Tennant specials but went ahead and got this anyway.  The cost is ridiculously low compared to if you bought all these separately. In fact it's a bit suspicious, but I'm not complaining.

We are huge Doctor Who fans so we thought it was worth a try for such a great deal. We got the item in and absolutely love it. The box set is sleek and very nice looking. The discs are tightly packaged, but just be careful and you should have no problems. You will figure out how to easily get the discs in and out of the sleeves. Great set.

4684277,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I read several complaints about the packaging that this set came in: the ""cardboard."" It is smooth on the inside, not rough like I had anticipation of, and while it may be snug, I would much prefer that over being loose. My discs came in perfect condition, and I couldn't have asked for a better set for the Tenth Doctor. I have seen discs be snapped when coming out of the ordinary plastic cases, or where they aren't tight enough, and get scratched and chipped from sliding around. If you're going to be watching the show daily, and pulling out the discs consistently, yeah, you should probably put them in a protective sleeve. Not only for the discs, but for the package as well.

The ""book"" is beautiful and interesting, I was extremely pleased with the design!

As for Doctor Who, there is nothing that I cannot love!",1330992000,2,822,4.547297297297297
4684278,5,B005FQ1OQ8,Great box set. Not sure what others are complaining about. The discs are easy to remove. Just not sure how well the binding of the book/case will hold up over time.

4684281,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"A 8/10 for the DVD content.
A 5/10 for the graphics on the packaging.
A 2/10 for the actual packaging.

I can't say anything about the actual DVD content of this, that hasn't been covered by others.  It's Doctor Who, it covers all the David Tennant episodes including the standard episodes, the Christmas specials, the year of specials before Tennant left, the two animated episodes, and an assortment of severely trimmed down Confidential episodes.  This included some of the best Doctor Who episodes, as well as a few of the worst, but it's still Doctor Who, and it's pretty much a fun ride all the way through, and video quality is great for DVD.

My problem is the packaging.  At first, it looks wonderful, beautiful, and a fairly unique way to have 26 discs stored. BUT!  Then you just think about it for a couple of seconds, and you realize that they did practically everything wrong except the graphics.  It's a very wide book format, containing a dozen pages that are built by sandwiching... cardstock-foam-cardstock-foam-cardstock.  The foam is about 2mm (1/16"") thick, and has cutouts so the discs slide in between two of the sheets of cardstock, and two slots exist across each side of each page, so most pages have four discs, two on the front face, two on the back face.
The bad part is quickly evident.  The book is deep, so it won't fit in anybody's DVD/BD/Tape shelves, it is too deep to even fit in most people bookshelves.  Unless stored rotated it just won't fit, so you won't see the spine.  Basically, this is only good, by it's size alone, to sit on a coffee table or similar place.
Now the worst part, the slots.  The slots are not protected in any way, no inner sleeves, no friction reducing material, no cleaning fabric, nothing.  The slots have notches only in front of the disc, and they are tight... VERY tight.  So, with interference from the center piece of cardstock you have to actually pinch/grab the disc and pull HARD to get it out.  This can only be done by touching both the front and back of the DVD... something that should NEVER be done, and this can't be helped, because the hub is completely inaccessible until the disc is pulled out.  Putting it back in is a little better, but I discovered that there is another issue... when all but one inch of the disc is inserted back into the slot, it stops.  You have to really force it to get it the rest of the way in.  Is this on just mine?  Maybe, but it was consistent across all but two of the slots.
So, if there is any dust, dirt, or worse, bigger particles like sand -- your disc WILL get scratched.  It DEFINITELY will.  Most of the discs that were removed for the very first time, were noticeably scratched (and my vision sucks).  Lord knows what they looked like after forcing them back in.
On top of that, two of the 26 discs were either previously damaged, or damaged enough by the slots, that they were unplayable (one wouldn't mount in any of 3 players, and the other skips, jumps and stutters, across two extensive parts of the disc).  It also didn't help that a few of the discs actually had GLUE SPATTER across the playing surface.  Was the glue from the packaging or the manufacturing stage?  I don't know, but it was transparent, and still tacky even after being removed from the book.

I don't know who thought this was a good design, but they should be fired, and have this debacle follow them in their next attempt at packaging design.  This should have been created with DVD-grip pages at the back of the ""book,"" so they could be removed properly, and the art and content pages, on single sheet cardstock, at the front of the book.  Nothing is lost, and the discs have the necessary protection.  As an alternative, several multi-disc Amaray cases could have been used, and then the graphics could be included in a book the size of the cases (like the Japanese companies do with their DVD and CD special boxes), and that way everything can fit in a standard video library/bookshelf.

I have to send my copy back, and if it's replacement isn't damaged like the first, the first thing I will be doing is to place all the discs in proper protective cases.

Great content, packaging a complete failure.

Also, if interested in this, you should probably get it sooner, than later, since, at the moment, the bootlegging companies in Asia, haven't yet managed to duplicate the ""book.""  However, the actual DVDs have already been bootlegged, in fact, more bootlegs exist now, than real copies, but they are being sold in the older single-season box sets.  These are easily recognized since the print jobs suck, and every DVD should be more than 7GB in size (except the animated episode discs).  So if you bought a season-box of Doctor Who, and the discs are 4GB or so in size (single layer), then you got ripped off!  And these aren't good bootlegs, as they actually have LESS THEN 50% of the video quality of the real thing.

Hope this helps.",1329264000,13,4942,4.562358276643991

I had no trouble getting my disc out unharmed and when it did feel like the disc was in too tight i followed the advice of a previouse review and sepperated the white tab holding the page tight.
  So no bad discs and everything David Tennant did as Doctor Who for an affordable price you cant go wrong. This set includes all previouse 10th doctor sets with the special features on those sets and the animated specials as well as a bonus disc of the Doctors greatest moments.

4684283,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"There are indeed problems with the design of this collection; but the content is stellar and at a significantly lower price point than buying the seasons individually.

The book the discs come in makes for a beautiful coffee table book, but it you plan to actually store the discs inside you're going to have problems.  The first thing I did after it arrived was remove all the discs as carefully as possible, and on their first removal about a quarter of the discs suffered minor scratches or chaffing.  I immediately stored the discs in a DVD folio I had picked up in anticipation... I've more than halfway through watching and despite the minor cosmetic damage, everything plays flawlessly.

Considering that to buy everything in this collection individually will run you somewhere in the neighborhood of $200, the $105 I paid for this was well worth it.  And I also got a coffee table book, for when I eventually acquire a coffee table.  I just hope that the BBC has better plans for the Matt Smith years.",1328918400,2,1009,4.704545454545454

I was weary of buying this due to all the negative reviews of the design of the disc holders, and I have to say that they were right. Unlike the last reviewer that had no issues taking them out, I did. Luckily I had a soft cloth and used that to grab discs without smudging them. Unfortunately there were about 5 discs that had spots of glue with one having an actual streak of it. I was able to use an alcohol pad and remove the glue, only the one with the streak ended up smudged. Though smudged I played most of it and it worked fine, I quickly made a back-up of it. I was close to sending it back for a replacement but feared that another one might be the same or worse. So I decided that I will test all discs and if no issues occur, I am keeping it as I really love this collection. Though I will say that they will not go back into the case. I will be using another disc case for the dvds as I would not want to risk dammaging any of the discs.

4684286,1,B005FQ1OQ8,"The BBC have just made the argument in favor of DVD piracy.

Many of the new Dr. Who shows are absolutely wonderful for young kids --- so the BBC decided to insert a number of forced previews at the beginning of each disk (many of which are not OK for young children -- Jeckyll?  really?!  what were these people thinking!)

So ... kick your feet up, put the disk in --- and watch something else for 5 minutes while until the forced previews run their course.

Add to that the fact that you'll have to buy a separate storage case -- and you just paid between $100 to $150 for the privilege.

(do they really think that fans watch the shows only once?  --- over and over and over you will be forced --- tape it off of TV or something)",1326240000,6,733,4.156028368794326

I tested to make sure I could get each disc out and see if they had gotten scratched, and each one is perfectly in tact.

HOWEVER, I ordered this set from Barnes and Noble where the price was somewhere around $103 rather than every other pricing I found at $155. I think the fact that I got the set for $50 less than all other listed prices in original condition and with no DVD removal/scratching problems is the best, considering how worried I was about that due to all the other reviews.

The DVDs arrived promptly and brand new and in perfect shape with no problems. So I hope all you Dr. Who fans buy this series and any others of your choice. It will always be the best of sy fy.

4684289,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I'm a recent fan of the show, but once I started watching, I was quickly drawn into the amazing worlds of Doctor Who.  Soon after watching episodes through streaming, I decided that I did want to invest in my own DVDs, so I bought a Series 1 box set and started looking for the rest.  Of course, at 6 seasons, and at anywhere from $50 - $80 a pop, I was well prepared to spend a pretty penny to eventually get all available series.

Then I found the David Tennant years box set, and being that Ten is ""my Doctor,"" I was absolutely delighted that I could get all three of his series and the specials in one set, for much less.  And I am very, VERY happy with this purchase!

I haven't had the issues with packaging that are mentioned in other reviews, though I agree that I prefer not to take out discs by touching the front and back (I'd rather be able to take out by grabbing the edges), but I was able to get them all out without any problems.  The graphics and layout are also gorgeous, and the box displays nicely.

As for the show istelf, as mentioned, Ten is my Doctor, and Series 2 - Series 4 contained some of my favorite episodes (and my favorite Companion, Donna) in the show so far.  I started with Chris Eccleston, and then moved on to David Tennant, and then Matt Smith, and while all three Doctors have great to watch, David Tennant was easily my favorite.  It's been a while since I've found a show that I fell in love with so quickly, but this one did it.  With everything a sci-fi geek like me could ask for, from ghost stories to time travel and aliens-crashland-on-planet-Earth adventures.  There were episodes that made me laugh out loud, and some that broke my heart.

I was glad that I read those reviews from folks who got their copies first. I took great care to get each disc out slowly. A couple of them had scratches, but I tested to make sure that at least the episodes played in some. The only one that doesn't play all the way is Doctor Who Animated: The Infinite Quest.

I then decided to check the reviews of this product, come to find multiple reviews with my same complaint. I immediately exchanged it. With the one I received today I used a knife to carefully cut the dividing walls on either side of the pages (between the DVDs.) I was extremely careful with this as I didn't want to damage the disk or the gorgeous design/artwork on any pages. Thankfully, this time, there are only three disks with minor scratches. I checked one of them earlier tonight and there was no problem playing. I plan to check the others over the next two days. If I have more problems I don't know that I'll exchange it or just get a refund. It's just a shame because Tennant is my Doctor and all of the episodes/specials were great (imo.)

4684304,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"I ordered this superb box set a few days ago and received it today. It is so gorgeous that I've spent hours fawning over every detail and its effects on me cannot be fully described on a respectable website like Amazon. Including every last moment of David Tennant's glorious reign, from the first moments of The Christmas Invasion through Matt Smith's first lines as the Eleventh Doctor, this is surely a set any fan of the new series would be beyond proud to own. These years defined the series' ability to stand independent of the Classic series (as well as a great continuation of it) and showed us some of the most psychologically complex aspects of the Doctor we would ever see. These years also had some of most interesting companions, speaking as a fan who has seen the first eight years of the classic series and all of the new one.

For the price, you cannot beat this set. I could not have gotten region one copies of all three seasons included here for what I paid, let alone the 2009 specials AND the two animated adventures voiced by Tennant. The set also includes a bonus disc I had not seen included in any of the individual sets, a ""Greatest Moments"" look at the Tenth Doctor's era.

The set is well-made, featuring a unique book-like style full of carefully chosen, gorgeously glossy stills from the show sure to please diehard fans and casual viewers alike. The discs come in slots at the top of each page. After reading some negative reviews of this product stating that the slots were too tight and damaged the discs, I was pleasantly surprised that while a few of the discs were wedged in a wee bit tighter than I should prefer, none of them were too difficult to remove and not a single disc came close to having its function impaired in the slightest. I surely hope that sets like mine are the rule rather than the exception, and I am delighted that I took the risk on this set despite the lower-rating reviews.

The utmost detail was put into every last millimeter of this set. For example, the second disc of series four in the individual season box set features an Ood pictured. Here it instead features one of the aliens from ""The Fires of Pompeii"" because it is part of a set which also contains a series two disc featuring an Ood, and the makers of this set wanted to make sure fans got the most variety for their money.

I could spend my whole night writing about how perfectly astounded in all the best of ways I am by this set, but instead I'm off to watch more of it and leave you with this parting advice: If you are even slightly considering buying this, absolutely do.",1318896000,28,2605,4.454926624737945

As long as you make sure and put a little pressure on the sleeves to separate the pocket, the DVDs slide out great. I've only examined a handful of the discs, but none have more than some minor surface scratching - and that's pretty common with DVD box sets. So, I heartily recommend this.

4684307,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"This set is absolutely gorgeous, you can flip through it like a book, and every page houses four DVD's, two on one side. But as other reviewers pointed out, it's extremely difficult to get the DVD's out unharmed. If the cardboard tab separating the discs weren't glued together, it would've been easier because on the last page of my set, the tab wasn't glued at all and I had no problems getting the discs out unharmed.

It's nearly impossible to stick your finger into the sleeves to grab the DVD's out by the middle. Sliding the discs out was easier, however, I can't imagine how long the discs could stay scratch-free if you slid them out all the time. Sliding out the first two discs gave me a few minor scratches but then I started sliding them out at an upwards angle so the bottom of the disc doesn't touch the surface. I managed to get the rest of the discs out scratch-free, tested them (they all work perfectly) and placed all of them in slim dvd cases instead of putting them back into the sleeves.

The set itself is wonderfully done, with the exception of the disc housing. But personally, I'm OK with putting the discs in separate slim dvd cases because at ~$100, it's a great price for Series 2-4 + Specials + Animated Specials in Region 1.",1318809600,4,1256,4.456521739130435
4684308,2,B005FQ1OQ8,"The two stars are not for the show. This is for the packaging. I have been anxiously awaiting this for the better part of 2 months. It arrived Wed. I was so excited. It was smaller than I thought it would be, about the size of a hardcover book. Good, it'll take up less room. The outside is nice, the photos inside are nice. But that's where the niceties end. There were no art cards that came in the season sets. I had expected as much, but they could have put them in anyway. But I didn't factor that into my rating. The big disappointment is the cardboard dvd pockets. They are so tight! I tried loosening the pocket by pulling each side. The dvds refused to slide out even a cm. So I grabbed it by the edge & gently pulled. Wouldn't budge. So I pulled harder. Nope. I had to yank it out with such great force, I'm surprised the dvd didn't fly across the room. It had scratches of course & 3 fingerprints. Why can't these people wear white gloves? Then I pulled the 2nd one the same way. This is when I decided that I would have to store them in something else. So I put those 2 back in the sleeves but they would only go 2/3rds in before stopping. I gently pushed. Nope, wouldn't budge, so I shoved. Wow, so disappointed. I should have gotten the separate sets. I priced the UK versions & they were a little cheaper. Had I remembered that amazon UK also offers free s&h, I would have purchased those. I give this set 2 stars because while it is pretty to look at the storage inside is ugly.

FOUND EASY SOLUTION - TRY THIS BEFORE RETURNING

I found the easiest way to get the dvds out. There is a piece of lightly glued cardboard between the pockets, gently pull & undo it from the white strip it's attached to. The dvds come out no problem, and it doesnt ruin the look of the page. Out of 26 dvds a lot were scratch free, about 4 or 5 had light scratches, the last one had a couple spots of something on it, but still played fine. Much happier with product & now I don't have to store the dvds in something else, but I'm not upping my rating, because I shouldn't have had to go through all this trouble.",1318550400,12,2108,4.15158924205379
4684309,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"After just receiving my set in the post, I've come to the following conclusion - do yourself a favor, prevent stress, and purchase the David Tennant years in their respective individual series sets. I realize you will be forking over more money, but I imagine it's worth it in the end.

Don't get me wrong, the packaging is absolutely gorgeous, inside and out. There are plenty of fantastic portraits and photographs within that showcase pivotal moments throughout the tenth Doctor's run. But the execution behind the structuring of the set is just awful, for lack of a better word. I can't imagine what the creators were thinking when putting this together.

The discs are nearly impossible to remove from their cardboard slots. And once you actually manage, they either get smudged or scratched as you force them out. It's even more difficult putting them back into the slot. And judging from two other reviews, I'm not the only one whose complained about this.

I really wanted to love this collection, I really did. And everything about it is wonderful, that one massive problem aside.

I'll be returning it first thing tomorrow and purchasing series two through four individually.

The show itself: 10/10. I don't see any point in going into the actual mythology behind Doctor Who, as a majority of the people who read this will already know everything there really is to. What can I say? It's pure sci-fi at its best.

The set: 5/10, for the reasons stated above. Images and art are wonderful. Structurally, the ball was dropped.",1318464000,139,1535,4.862068965517241
4684310,5,B005FQ1OQ8,"You can't go wrong buying these episodes. David was a wonderful Doctor, and these stories are fantastic.

Don't forget about Matt Smith though; he's amazing too.

Unifortunately, the stories were filmed in the older format, so only the Specials starting with The Next Doctor were filmed in Blu-Ray format.  But it doesn't really matter that much. David still looks glorious in these.",1318464000,,383,5.145161290322581
4684311,1,B005FQ1OQ8,"I just received my set and at first was very impressed. This set has everything I wanted from David Tennant's run as the Doctor and for a lot less than buying the individual seasons thanks to Amazon's pre-order pricing guarantee.

The book presentation is very attractive and the artwork (primarily stills from the series) is nicely laid out. But as I went through the set, my excitement faded with each turn of the page. The discs are very difficult to remove from the sleeves (one won't come out at all) and many of the discs are scratched. Two of the discs won't play at all, which means I have a 26-disc set that's missing three discs in total. That's unacceptable.

I'm exchanging the set for a new one and hope that the replacement will be in much better condition than my original. If it isn't, I will return it for a full refund.",1318291200,184,837,4.4640522875816995
4684312,1,B005FQ1OQ8,"I just received my Doctor Who: The David Tennant Years. I was ecstatic because it's beautiful. It looks like a book, and when you open it there are gorgeous graphics and a fantastic quote at the beginning. (The ""Fire and Ice"" quote). Then I saw how the DVDs are packaged. It's a slot at the top (see picture) that is cardboard on each side and very tight. I very carefully pulled each disc out, one by one to inspect them. The first few were fine, but as you go further, the discs become harder and harder to get out. At first it was only a tiny scratch, but when I got to the last disc (one of the cartoons), it practically gouged the disc. I was pulling them out with the utmost care, gently trying to get the slots as wide and loose as possible before moving the disc, but my efforts were in vain. It is terrible packing. Whomever designed it gets a huge fail. What a shame. I was so incredibly excited about it, and the rest of it is gorgeous. Will be sending it back tomorrow. Disappointing. David Tennant's Doctor deserves better.

Update:
Decided to get another set and try my hand at getting all of the discs out, then stretching out the pouches with a disc I don't care about. Will report on my findings. I REALLY want to keep this set!

Double Update All the Way:
Decided to just get a refund on it. I'm so disappointed. For $100, I don't want to have to put the discs in other cases and worry about losing them. I just want common sense packaging. I'll just keep Netflixing the episodes until the box sets drop in price or they fix this packaging problem.",1318291200,292,1566,4.287162162162162
4684313,3,B005FQ1OQ8,"I'm glad to see that they are issuing this as a complete set, but the fact that its not been reissued on Blu-Ray in 2011 is ridiculous. Even if the show was not filmed in HD, the footage is new enough that it would clearly benefit from an HD transfer.",1318118400,2,251,4.04

4684315,4,B005FQ1OQ8,"I think finally North America deserves the full Box Set series with the 10th doctor, BUT:

If I were you, I'd strongly recommend to get the Original UK Box Set which has the 2005 new version of Doctor Who since Season 1 to 4, remember that the season 1 was with the 9th doctor and D. Tennant came only in the 2nd season. And the Bonus materials are the same on each disc as this one.

I got the UK Box Set earlier this year, and it's amazing. Note: It doesn't include the Dream animation nor any of the Specials (But it's better, because the Specials are the only ones available on BLU-RAY, so I got that Box Set separate). PLUS! The price of it is half cheaper than this one. I payed 75$ for the 1 through 4 season, while USA is selling 100$ each season separately, and almost 200$ for this one.

Here's the product link (but go to Amazon UK):&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Complete-Series-1-4-23-DVD-Box-Set-Dr-Who-Doctor-Who-Complete-Series-One-to-Four-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-4-Import-United-Kingdom/dp/B005EN784Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Complete Series 1-4 - 23-DVD Box Set ( Dr. Who ) ( Doctor Who - Complete Series One to Four ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2.4 Import - United Kingdom </a>] (I'll add my pictures there of the UK Box Set that I got).

Then you can get the Blu-Ray Boxset of the Complete Specials:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Complete-Specials-The-Next-Doctor-Planet-of-the-Dead-The-Waters-of-Mars-The-End-of-Time-Parts-1-and-2-Blu-ray/dp/B002ZHKZEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Complete Specials (The Next Doctor / Planet of the Dead / The Waters of Mars / The End of Time Parts 1 and 2) [Blu-ray</a>]

P.D.: It's PAL format, but as long as you have a Free-Region player (99.9% of today's DVD players are), you're good to go! Also, PAL is the original format the series was recorded in, so no need to get the NTSC re-encoded format :)

Disc 1: The Infinite Quest
Disc 2: Dreamland
Special Features:
Disc 3: Doctor Who's Greatest Moments""

Do you think that little bit is worth the extra $44?
I think there should be some price drop that gives a much better incentive to buy the box set.
Keep in mind that at a preorder of $180 that that means each CD is about $7.
