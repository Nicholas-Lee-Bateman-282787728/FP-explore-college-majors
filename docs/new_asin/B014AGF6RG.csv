7385593,5,B014AGF6RG,"Finally this classic receives the proper Bluray treatment it deserves. I had rented a copy of the earlier Bluray edition of the film from Blockbuster years ago and even though it was HD, the quality looked fishy, as if the film was projected onto a screen and taped with a camcorder. This 25th anniversary edition redeems that. Don't buy the earlier edition. Instead, make sure to buy this one.",1510704000,,394,4.72463768115942

7385599,4,B014AGF6RG,"RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Martin Scorsese, Goodfellas tells the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his life through his teen years in the late 50s through his years in the Mob in the 60s-80s, covering his relationships with his wife (Lorraine Bracco), his mistress (Gina Mastrogiacomo), his Boss (Paul Sorvino) and his partners Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) & Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in the Italian-American crime syndicate in the New York City area.

Im not big on mob movies, but I have to admit that Goodfellas is consistently entertaining and delivers a potent message on misguided loyalties, greed and the folly of getting involved in organized crime regardless of its great perks. In the long run it aint worth it. I couldn't wait till the arrogant little POS Tommy (Pesci) bought the farm. The feminine cast is rounded out by Debi Mazar and Welker White. Even Samuel L. Jackson shows up.

THE MOVIE RUNS 146 minutes and was shot mostly in the New York City/New Jersey area, but also Chicago & Tampa. WRITERS: Nicholas Pileggi with additional stuff from Scorsese.

7385645,4,B014AGF6RG,"This is my #1 Top Movie, and I love it to death.  It was my window into true film adoration, and I will never not watch it.
So I decided to upgrade my previous BluRay with this superior Transfer... now I'm not going to talk about that, since it looks nice and sounds nice (as it should).  What I am going to say is if you (like me) get the 1 disc version (which I didn't investigate throughly enough before hitting buy) you will get no special features besides the commentary, and I was super bummed about that.  Also that -1 star includes the new cover art, because it leaves off Joe Pesci and it really doesn't do the movie justice.  I ended up keeping my old Blu for the Special features and cover case and the new disc just for the movie itself.  Everybody takes a beating sometime.",1473897600,,786,4.248322147651007

7385653,5,B014AGF6RG,"I was sceptical to if a movie I've seen 20-30 times over the years could actually be better with a new transfer from original film to BluRay.

Visually the transfer is great, still feels like film. Grain and contrast of 35mm is here and looks great. All the blemishes from previous DVD, BR transfers are gone.

The audio is the star! DTS MA sounds fantastic and pulls out all the amazing dialog and VO like never before!

7385672,5,B014AGF6RG,"Goodfellas (1990) is a strange concoction of a film; its witty, angry, violent, humorous, but fun overall. Some people consider it better than The Godfather; I pause for a moment (respectfully) then contemplate the possibility. Yes, The Godfather's setting and time period is from a generation before Goodfellas, but its execution of bringing about the perfect crime film may actually take a backseat to Goodfellas for the simple reason that Goodfellas offers a more well-rounded experience. I actually think Ray Liotta's narration adds flavor to everything, and isn't annoying, because Henry Hill (played by Liotta) is such an interesting character, so we're mesmerized by everything he does. Lorraine Bracco is stellar as Karen, and Robert De Niro shines as well. Of course, there's Joe Pesci's unforgettable performance that's disturbing, yet funny in a weird way. What makes Goodfellas work is its overall charm to the viewer; the audience can temporarily forget all of the ugliness at certain times in the film, because there's plenty of real life activity to go around. This blu ray is the 25th Anniversary set, and it's loaded with nice extras to make your viewing experience complete. I'll admit that it took me several viewings to get on board with this film. To me, it's one of those films that resonates over time, because it's quite an onslaught at first in terms of the violence. Only later do you come to appreciate the film as a more well-rounded experience. Martin Scorsese is a great director, and this may be his best work.",1460937600,,1541,5.0234375

Personally I was very disappointed in that regard.  Maybe they are watching it on a 1080p television, I really am not sure.  I have a 55"" 4k Samsung and the movie looked very 'grainy'.  Maybe I was expecting too much but honestly, if you already have a bluray copy of the movie I would keep that and not bother.
