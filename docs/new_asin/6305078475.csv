7882123,5,6305078475,"Buck Privates was very good but i think you will find this movie even better because its faster paced, good action, plenty of funny moments, and i believe it has better direction. I highly recommend this one. This is  another Abbott and Costello film well worth watching. Not all of thier  films are great but this one is so just enjoy it.",963792000,,339,4.451612903225806
7882124,4,6305078475,"Another rare case of a sequel topping the original.  There is some effective sentiment to go along with the clowning.  Along with 'The Time of Their Lives' and 'Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein', this one ranks  as one of the boys' best.",947462400,,240,4.666666666666667
