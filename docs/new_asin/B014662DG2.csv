I have the old Geneon box, but for a full series and a movie, this is great deal and I would strongly consider getting it.",1448150400,3,173,4.117647058823529
7385166,4,B014662DG2,"Saw this back on Funimation Channel around 2013 I think.  Basically it's about a group of people, children piloting things called Fafners battling  aliens called Festum and they're on an island.  Is all I can say since I can't really deal much of a review.  Also the A.I. (Anime Industry) just made a sequel called Exodus for this series as I heard.",1446595200,4,349,4.580645161290323

Story seems to be complete and would possibly rate it higher if I was able to stay interested long enough to finish the series but haven't been able to finish it. Fortunately thanks to the SAVE edition I didn't waste a lot of money on this.,1481328000,,264,4.408163265306122
