5340679,5,B009IT0O3W,"The real life situations these Christians find themselves in, and how God uses them to make a difference in so many lives through such powerful means, is a testimony to the love God has for us, and the gifts we have that he wants to tap in to for the Glory of His Kingdom.  Thought provoking, encouraging, real.",1357689600,,311,4.362068965517241
5340680,5,B009IT0O3W,This is an awesome end to a trilogy. God is really so good and is doing so much in the nations. This movie builds so much faith and is so needed in the body of Christ right now.

5340684,5,B009IT0O3W,"One word: incredible!!! I bought the deluxe edition and I feel like that's the only way to go. The movie quality has def upgraded since Finger of God.

Highly recommend to watch the film but even further to purchase your own copy and I would recommend the deluxe edition. Enjoy!",1350864000,2,381,4.457142857142857

5340686,5,B009IT0O3W,"Absolutely amazing!  Watch what happens when simple faith meets the spirit of the Almighty God and cameras are running!

Deluxe edition has footage of the Qumran cave, more Dome of the Rock footage, testimonies, and healings than they could fit in the regular movie.",1410134400,2,266,5.0227272727272725
5340687,5,B009IT0O3W,"How did Christianity get so boring and commonplace with such an awesome, powerful, and creative supernatural  God? Thank you God that Christianity isn't just going to church on Sundays! i love that God is encouraging His children in the supernatural!",1407024000,2,250,5.25
5340688,5,B009IT0O3W,great examples of the power of God,1399507200,,34,4.0
5340689,5,B009IT0O3W,"I first bought the regular movie than eventually found the deluxe edition. It costs a lot no doubt. I loan out the original movie now. There are 4 discs in the deluxe edition and there is a lot of material. Some may not like it. Its real life and It is long, like i said there is a lot of material. To me it was worth the cost. I think about this material frequently. If you don't have time to pay attention or think or be quiet, its not likely for you. But if you do, be blessed.",1397347200,2,480,3.9081632653061225
5340690,5,B009IT0O3W,The film is very inspiring.  If anyone has questions about God this film will certainly bless them.  I would recommend this to all.,1394582400,,131,4.6521739130434785

5340694,5,B009IT0O3W,This is a visual witness of how God works and uses His servants.  Anyone who has a desire know Jesus and to be like the Lord should see this and then put this knowledge to use in everyday life.,1376956800,,193,3.948717948717949
5340695,5,B009IT0O3W,I loved the continued stories about how God met each person so uniquely and individually with His amazing goodness and miracles. Love the boldness and the examples other believers set in praying for healing over God's children...without limits or fear about where anyone comes from. Have shared it with all my family and friends...a true faith builder and outside of the box documentary!,1376697600,,387,5.158730158730159
5340696,5,B009IT0O3W,"What can I add to my other reviews of Darren Wilson's films? If these films don't stir you at all you better check your pulse. His other films (Finger of God, Furious Love) are just amazing. Why didn't anyone ever think of this before? You know, have a camera going while someone prays for healings and miracles. All 3 films are linked together. Same jewel you are looking at but just looking at a different facet.

For those with eyes to see your faith will increase. You might even find yourself looking for the extreme goodness of God in your own life. You are no less loved by God than the people who experienced those things in the film. After watching these films you might find yourself believing in a God that is too small. It will be fun to see just what seeds are being planted while you watch these movies and what kind of fruit will be harvested from them. After watching these films yourself spend some time reflecting on showing them to others. People are starving for the real God. Most of them don't know where to look. This is a good place to start. The ones who will be offended are not those who do not go to church but those who do. The Pharisees who criticized, hated, and persecuted Jesus are alive and well today. These films will offend the religious but those who are child-like will be thrilled. Get the films, watch the films a few times, share them with others Brilliant!",1376265600,2,1399,4.422480620155039
5340697,5,B009IT0O3W,I first saw this video last year when it was free for a couple of days. I stayed up through the night and watched it multiple times. It so impacted me as I watched a wept at seeing the power of God displayed. Father of Lights challenged me to love greater and to seek God to see his purposes fulfilled in my life.,1376006400,2,313,3.984126984126984
5340698,5,B009IT0O3W,"This video is the third in a series.  The first one was ""The Finger of God"" and the second ""Furious Love"".  They were all great and need to be viewed by all.  The God of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob is truly doing miraculous things on the earth today.  Watch  and see!",1373587200,,265,4.117647058823529
5340699,5,B009IT0O3W,"Its was fast delivery and product was awesome. the movie was very inspiring and left a faith lifter
I was so happy with the product",1372550400,,131,4.28
5340700,5,B009IT0O3W,"These stories are priceless. We need to understand the words of scripture in a way that all will understand. If a picture is worth a thousand words, this is a masterpiece.",1372464000,2,171,4.548387096774194
5340701,5,B009IT0O3W,"I enjoyed watching and following the journey of Darren and his camera crew on this documentary. I am looking forward to the next one on ""Holy Spirit"".  The world is thirsty for the supernatural and this series of videos offer a glimpse and snapshot into the signs and wonders Jesus talked about. I rate it 5 stars.",1372204800,2,314,4.508771929824562
5340702,5,B009IT0O3W,"Would recommend this movie to everyone.  Really makes you think.  If your faith doesn't hold up under questioning, you don't have anything.",1368576000,,139,5.2727272727272725
5340703,5,B009IT0O3W,"The movie was exactly what you would expect from Darren Wilson.  I have truly enjoyed all three movies in the series...Finger of God, Furious Love and the final one of the trilogy, Father of Lights.  If you have the extra money I recommend the Deluxe Versions of the movies.  They are well worth it and the additional footage really adds a lot of insight into the docu-testimonies.

God is going such amazing things through Wanderlust Productions.  I can't wait to see what God has them do next!",1367193600,,495,4.64367816091954
5340704,5,B009IT0O3W,"This the thrid in a series produced by Darren Wilson (Finger of God; and, Furious Love) changes the way we view Christianity. For years we've stated, ""relationship over religion"" is the way to go, but this series shows relationship with God in action.  Takes our Christianity beyond words and good doctrine and shows the power of living a life while being guided by God's Holy Spirit. A must for any Christian who's life is not yet matching the power seen in scripture.",1364774400,2,469,4.719512195121951
5340705,2,B009IT0O3W,"I liked the shorter version of this so I thought I would get the extended version.  The so called, ""resurrection from the dead"" the director plays up is just a women who got drunk and thought she died and had a near death experience and then woke up. There is not much new footage. I would save your money and just go with the cheaper version. I also read that its not true that only Muslims are allowed in the dome, its a tourist attraction. I was hoping for a lot more footage, and not just a lot of people talking.",1364601600,4,517,4.118811881188119
5340706,5,B009IT0O3W,This movie shows that God still hears the prayers of His children and still performs amazing miracles in this day and age.,1362528000,,122,4.590909090909091
5340707,5,B009IT0O3W,"God is with us. He is at work in the world every day. If you don't believe that He exists, or if you don't believe that he still heals, speaks and moves in people today, then you need to see this movie.",1361232000,,202,3.8333333333333335
5340708,5,B009IT0O3W,Excellent insights as to what Holy Spirit is doing in the world.  The Kingdom of God is invading and overshadowing us.,1360800000,,118,4.619047619047619
5340709,5,B009IT0O3W,"I've seen Finger of God and Furious Love. I loved both. And Father of Lights did not disappoint. It was very touching to see the amazing love our father demonstrates to his children. My eyes watered throughout much of the film. I thought I was holding it together until the very last part (when they traveled to Israel) and then I just lost it. Just like the first 2 films, Darren narrates and takes you through a small window into the lives of those around the world who have and are experiencing the miracles of God. He travels to China, India, Israel, and more. Buying this video was an investment into the Kingdom and I will surely share this video with others.",1360627200,,665,4.459016393442623
5340710,5,B009IT0O3W,Informative and worth watching over and over....this video is educational and a spiritual awakening.........Its important to view and share as well,1360368000,,147,6.0476190476190474
5340711,5,B009IT0O3W,I haven't watched all of the dvd's. What I have watched I've been inspired and challenged. This is no ordinary film. This is an experience with the Father.,1360195200,,155,4.571428571428571
5340712,5,B009IT0O3W,"I have seen Darren's first 2 productions for this trilogy. I really enjoyed #1 Finger of God, kind of liked #2 Furious Love But by far my favorite is #3 Father of Lights. These stories are very moving. I love seeing what God is doing in the lives of reckless radical lovers. The bonus stories on disk 3 have impacted me deeply. I have shown some of them to other friends and even after multiple viewings I am so stirred, weeping in awe of Him! I have not seen all of the disks yet but am looking forward to doing so a little at a time to let the impact be deep. I highly recommend!!! It is not that I agree with everything said by those interviewed, I do not. But It is plain that God is  up to something. I am going to hide these things in my heart till He reveals what He thinks I can handle. And I purpose to love those whose theology does not match mine. ""By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples..."" It's so much easier to love those you agree with...;-)",1359590400,2,970,4.052083333333333

8542091,3,B009IT0O3W,We bought this hoping there would be more info on NDE experiences. It follows 1 guy's story and is rather boring at times.,1525046400,,122,4.3478260869565215
8542092,5,B009IT0O3W,Arrived on time and is a great watch.,1516147200,,37,3.75
8542093,5,B009IT0O3W,This is third time ordering it and couldn't pass up the  off price! I need to stop lending it out! RECOMMEND you get the Deluxe version of all of this series. This is my favorite of the 4-5. There is not-to-be missed extra footage on the extra DVDs as well as theological viewpoints that help you think through things.,1515801600,,318,4.389830508474576
8542094,5,B009IT0O3W,Amazing film!,1485648000,,13,6.0

8542100,5,B009IT0O3W,"This Darren Wilson documentary is better than the last two, it just blew me away.  These movies have really made me reevaluate my faith and have inspired me to develop an action packed relationship with God and his son Jesus Christ.",1417824000,,232,4.658536585365853
