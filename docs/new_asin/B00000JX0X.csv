8168311,3,B00000JX0X,"In 1974, 19-year-old Fernando Bujones, then a soloist with American Ballet Theatre, entered the Varna International Ballet Competition VII.  By age, he fell in the junior category.  However, he elected to enter in the senior  category, and became the first American male dancer to win a gold medal in  an international ballet competition.
This video (home-made quality)  covers all of Bujones's performances at the competition, plus a smattering  of performances by other dancers.  Unfortunately, the makers of the video  thought it would be helpful to have two people acting as commentators  during the dancing, as in figure skating competitions--very annoying!  As a  video, it's disappointing.  But if you think (as I do) that Bujones was one  of the greatest ballet dancers ever, then buy this video, as it is a little  bit of dance history and an opportunity to see this star at the impressive  beginning of his career.
For better ballet competition videos, try  ""World's Young Ballet"" (first Moscow International Ballet  Competition), ""Holiday of Ballet"" (1981, Moscow) or ""Erik  Bruhn Prize"" (competitors from Denmark, Canada, England and USA).  Bujones appears on video in ""Giselle,"" ""American Ballet  Theatre at the Met:  Mixed Bill,"" ""Bujones in Class"" and  ""Bujones - In His Image.""",964051200,11,1293,5.297029702970297
