4396774,2,B004KDYQYO,"This might have been the least interesting seasons of TUF. Kos' trash talking skills are pretty weak. He uses the ""bro you're a nurse"", line about 20 times without being able to come up with any remotely original follow-up insults. Yes, he's good at getting people to hate him, but why is that considered a skill these days?

GSP is likeable but other than his ""bully"" story on the bonus footage, he doesn't have a lot of interesting things to say either.

Most of the house antics we've seen before in previous seasons (smashing stuff, lame ""pranks""). Most of the conflicts amongst the fighters were the drunken ""I'd squash you"" stuff which became stale many seasons ago.

In my opinion the highlights of the show were GSP's Thai boxing coach showing up drunk before sparring sessions and Cody's deadly skills with the guillotine.",1306195200,7,831,4.7972027972027975
8432865,5,B004KDYQYO,Love the series!,1511481600,,16,4.666666666666667
8432866,5,B004KDYQYO,Gift for my little brother. He is a huge wresting/MMA fan so this is right up his alley. He loved it!,1465948800,,101,3.857142857142857
8432867,5,B004KDYQYO,"I wasn't a gsp fan before this season, but I was after.  Koscheck acts like an immature prick for the entire season, but he gets his in the end.",1437696000,,144,3.9655172413793105
8432868,4,B004KDYQYO,"Good season at a great price,  not the best season but I enjoy them all and it's definitely not as bad as the new seasons.  Great drama as usual and some good fights.",1418688000,,166,4.0
8432869,4,B004KDYQYO,"Same as most seasons (not all, but most) so far.  Enthusiasts and true fans will like it. Probably not worth a 2nd viewing, but hey, you can resell it used, yeah?",1406592000,,162,4.225806451612903
8432870,5,B004KDYQYO,"Very happy about receiving my product on time, My only concern was that I bought the product Brand New, when I Received it and open the package there was a few scratches on the side of the product which was in convenient as a customer,either than that everything is good!",1397606400,,271,4.44
8432871,4,B004KDYQYO,Less rushed. Pissed me off that Dana didn't punish Koscheck tho. He kicks fighters off...why not coaches?! That very hypocritical.,1389744000,,130,5.55
8432872,5,B004KDYQYO,These hoses were a perfect replacement for the original wore out hoses. They installed with no problems. Thank you for a great product,1357516800,,134,4.869565217391305
8432873,5,B004KDYQYO,I believe that this is one of the better seasons of the show TUF. Watson and Cody are my favorite fighters on the show.,1336262400,,119,4.0
8432874,5,B004KDYQYO,Great season just like most of them in this boxset. Has some crazy unedited biffs involving Josh Koscheck and a member of GSPs crew which is worth admission fee on its own.,1316822400,,172,4.40625
