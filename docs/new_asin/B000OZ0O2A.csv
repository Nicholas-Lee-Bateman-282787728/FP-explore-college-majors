8187789,3,B000OZ0O2A,"Advance Level Design should say ""designed for counterstrike and Half-life 2"".  I bought this DVD to learn Valve's Hammer editor for Left 4 Dead, since the editor is similar to Half-life 2.  It provides enough to get you started, but ultimately I found better, more recent tutorials on Youtube or Valve's developer wiki.  I'd like to see the author come out with a newer set of tutorials based on recent Hammer games.  The audio is a little low at times, so be prepared to turn up the sound every now and then.

Overall, its a good DVD for when there weren't the amount of resources available online today.",1290038400,,605,4.564814814814815
8187790,3,B000OZ0O2A,"In the first couple of minutes of this video training the narrator states, ""...we'll cover the basics as well as intermediate and certainly some advanced topics"". Not quite what I was expecting from the title.",1270857600,2,209,5.0
8187791,5,B000OZ0O2A,"This DVD presents step by step phases that leads you to create your own game worlds, which is one of the most cranky things on game level designs. Easy to follow examples and self-explanatory videos with a understandable teacher's voice which is a very good thing.

If you enjoy games, and have the idea to create your own based on Valve's technology, this is one of the very first things that you ought to buy!!! Enjoy it!",1202601600,,423,4.4935064935064934
