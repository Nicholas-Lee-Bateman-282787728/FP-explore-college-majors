8470868,5,B005G02R7S,"Brilliant version of this old story. The design is breathtaking and performances terrific. It can be watched in French or Italian depending on your preference. The director is Italian as are some  of the actors but it is a French novel and
that is my preference. English sub-titles are available.",1404950400,2,296,4.92
8470869,5,B005G02R7S,"i am happy that they have released this with english subtitles.  i saw this film at the international film market after it was released in europe in 1990 and have wanted it ever since.

art direction and production design are flawless, and the amazing thing is that it was lit and shot entirely indoors at cinecitta!  the sets are incredible, it is as beautiful as i remember it, and i recommend it.

my one complaint is that the audio is in french, and i remember that the film i saw was in italian (but i could be wrong).

if your player can't play PAL, then get yourself one that can - this film is worth it!",1357689600,,611,4.232758620689655
