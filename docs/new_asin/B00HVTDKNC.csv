The father is a high flying, go getting executive who spends more time at the office than he does with his family. The son is destined to take after his father so is `hot housed' in educational terms, even having to learn the piano in his miniscule spare time.

Then they get called back to the hospital where their son was born. Once there they are told that there has been a bit of a mix up and their son is not theirs but belongs to another family who have also been given their real son.
So both families have to meet to try to find a way out of the mess and heartache is not going to be too far away.

This is a two hour film and is so well filmed and directed that you just don't notice. The children are absolutely brilliant. Some of the scenes must have been very hard to act as the emotions must have been ramped right up. I absolutely loved it and yes got a bit moist eyed towards the end which is a very god thing so I can absolutely easily recommend.",1399507200,3,1135,3.995594713656388
