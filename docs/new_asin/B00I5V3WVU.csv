8639507,5,B00I5V3WVU,"Very interesting and different from a fans perspective, covered the goings on outside the courtroom and interviewed fans and filmed the media crew talking about various things.",1400544000,,176,5.555555555555555
8639508,5,B00I5V3WVU,"Everyone should see this, even non fans because it will tell you just how biased the media is, how you can't always believe the news because they manipulate when an agenda is presented. The media sought to portray Michael Jackson fans as insane, illiterate, inarticulate fools but this film proves everyone wrong. We are the biggest fan base and family in the world all for one man who has changed and saved many lives with his music and message. I really wish the film were longer, I didn't want it to end! Michael deserved better in life and he deserves better now that he has passed because you have so many news outlets slandering his name and still spreading lies about these allegations against an innocent man.",1397088000,2,717,4.653543307086614
8639509,4,B00I5V3WVU,"I'm a Michael' supporter. I couldn't go to the USA supporting Him, this is the most enormous regret in my life. When I watch this DVD, I feel to be there in the middle of  this suffering, I am just sorry that it is not subtitled in French.",1394150400,,239,3.9791666666666665
8639510,5,B00I5V3WVU,"The Trials of Michael Jackson offers a seldom seen before and fascinating look into the workings of how the media reported on the Michael Jackson trial in 2005.  I highly recommend it.  It reveals eye-opening insights into how the media operates behind the scenes in order to present their version of the ""truth"".  From reporters rehearsing a guilty speech before the verdict was even announced, to their reactions when the camera was turned on them for a change, to their attempts at manipulating the fans and how they were viewed who were out in support of Michael.

The producers were able to gain a view of the trial the public did not get to see.  Not just outside the courthouse, but from also inside as they watched the proceedings for themselves and listened to actual testimony, not just from the prosecution's side but also from the defense side as well.  Because of this they are able to present a clearer picture than most of the media who were only interested presenting the prosecution's side.

The media's disdain for facts and downright cruelty in their depiction of Michael Jackson and those who were out there to show their support, is something every one who cares about truth and how its depicted should see.  Truth is a precious commodity and should never be thrown lightly aside because it doesn't fit an specific agenda or may not attract enough advertising dollars.  And we as the public hold a responsibility to ensure we receive the full story instead of accepting what a media driven by profit feed to us, just because its easier to do so.

My thoughts watching this film, continuously turned to Michael Jackson himself.  Imagine being the target of all of that hate, animosity, and derision every day for months?  On a global scale no less? How do you convince people of your innocence when it seems no-one is listening or wants to listen?",1392163200,6,1867,4.746130030959752
8639511,5,B00I5V3WVU,"This film is a ""must see"" for anyone who harbors doubts about the Media's power to manipulate and control public perception.  The film makers turned their cameras on certain well known ""journalists"" reporting from Michael Jackson's 2005 Santa Maria, CA trial, as said ""journalists"" attempted to interview Michael's fans and supporters for the sole purpose of sensationalizing and depicting the fans as fanatical and obsessed.

With no televised coverage of the 2005 trial, the only information received by the public was from ""journalists"" and reporters who had access to the courtroom, most of whom were only too eager to report the prosecution side of the case while saying little if anything about Tom Mesereau's decimation of prosecutor Sneddon's witnesses and slim evidence.  This, combined with their wholly inaccurate depiction of Michael's ""crazed fans"", leaves little doubt in my mind why, to this day, there remain so many individuals who believe Michael Jackson, a man totally vindicated by acquittal, was just another guilty celebrity who escaped prison.

To those who hold that erroneous belief, I urge you to view this excellent film, conduct your own research, read all available court transcripts, and then open your eyes to the manipulative power of an out-of-control, greed driven media to shape public opinion and perception.

Hopefully, the film makers will create a ""Part II""!",1391212800,10,1397,5.331818181818182
8639512,5,B00I5V3WVU,"If you are a fan or even if you're not, this is a MUST for all. This made me sad, mad, frustrated all at the same time. What the media did and are still doing to Michael JACKSON is sickening. Watch this and you will see exactly how the media does things and how they change stories to make it appear worse than it appears. The media has gotten worse over the years. Today is no different. Please, buy this!! You'll see what I mean. I'm sorry Michael that they did this to you.",1391126400,8,476,4.074468085106383
