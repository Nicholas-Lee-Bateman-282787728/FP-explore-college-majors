8143611,4,B000I2KQP4,"A good video about this fiesty woman who has done so much to make people aware of nuclear radiation and its hazards.  Co-creator of the Physicians for Social responsibility and creator of Women's Action for New Direction, Dr. Caldicott remains active within the ant-nuclear movement, even in her 70s.  I've met Helen on several occasions, one being at the Savannah River Site, and last heard her speak in 2011 at a WAND event in Georgia.

A movie everyone on both sides of the nuclear issue should see.",1344556800,3,502,4.747126436781609
8143612,4,B000I2KQP4,"Helen Caldicott has long been one of my personal heroes, and so I was delighted to see a reinvigoration of interest in her work to disarm the nations of this world by educating the people of our planet about the deadly effects of nuclear weapon use. What I was not prepared for was the realization that, in the years since Dr. Caldicott first began to deliver her prophetic message, much of the world's population (including myself) have become psychically numbed to the dangers we live with every day. Therefore, I hadn't stayed abreast of her struggle to keep this message from its slow death, nor of her incredibly hard work to resuscitate it again and again.

Bless Helen Caldicott. Accused of everything from ""old and boring"" to ""shrill and strident,"" she has continued to go where most fear to tread, and to speak when most have fallen silent and compliant. She even has to defend her message within the boundaries of her own family.

Watching the film, I too found myself wishing she would stop raising her voice, would calm the message, would stop being so insistent that we pay attention and, worse yet, do something about the mess we're in. I found myself wanting to stop the film, slip off to the computer for a few rounds of solitaire, eat, anything but sit in place and listen. How glad I am that discipline sometimes works, and that I sat in place...and I listened.

This is not a pretty film or a pretty message. In the end, I came to understand the necessity for raising one's voice to be heard above the steady drone of iPods (a metaphor for contemporary psychic numbing). I came to admire her for labeling the Bushies as the seriously troubled people they were/are. I found an awe at her tenacity (still speaking out in her 70's) and a renewed respect for a woman who wants her life to be dedicated to the highest possible good: loving life enough to stop destroying it for personal or egoic gain.

In the film, Dr. Caldicott states that she would like her epitaph to read, ""She tried."" And so she did. Under the current circumstances, we should all be so shrill.

I highly recommend this film to all who seek a personal hero courageous enough to take on absolutely everyone who refuses to hear the prophets in our midst.",1296259200,9,2239,4.5875
