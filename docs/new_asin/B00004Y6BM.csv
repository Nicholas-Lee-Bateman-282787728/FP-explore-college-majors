1373639,5,B00004Y6BM,I did not see the American remake of this superior Danish thriller.  Director Ole Bornedall knows how to created nerve wracking suspense and real shocking horror.  The film starts slowly and carefully creates an atmosphere of dread.  The clever screenplay has several interesting twist. A must see for any fan of intelligent thrillers- and for once a film truly worthy of comparison to the master- Hitchcock.,1005436800,4,408,5.151515151515151
1373640,4,B00004Y6BM,"Ole Bornedal's original 1994 Nightwatch has his 1998 American remake beat, hands down.  The original is so much more restrained and controlled, the tautness of it practically hits you in the face.  Unlike Nick Nolte's unabashedly hammy performance, the actor who plays the investigating cop here keeps a lid on his emotions and so his character is infinitely more credible.  The pacing is tighter, the acting is just sparse enough--and therefore supremely effective--and the suspense, based on this minimalistic perspective, is that much more palpable.
The story of a young law student taking a job as a hospital morgue attendant, and subsequently encountering strange goings-on, including the appearance of the bodies of some suddenly dead girls--this film is justifiably counted as a top European thriller.  Martin, the law student, is taunted by his buddy to engage in some pretty unconventional stunts; the convergence of Martin's experiences in the morgue with his ever-increasing out-of-control actions leads ultimately to a horrific confrontation.
It was interesting to see that Ewan McGregor, who played Martin in the remake, is amazingly close in appearance to the Danish actor playing the same role.  McGregor was OK, but there again, he tended on occasion--no doubt pandering to American audiences--to emote just a bit too much.  And rather than suffer through another of Josh Brolin's performances, catch Kim Bodnia as Martin's buddy.  He shines.
There is really no comparison.  This is the movie to watch, not the '98 remake.",1004486400,22,1538,5.352697095435684
1373641,4,B00004Y6BM,"if you have and thought it was only OK but could have been better than see this...the better version.  This movie out shines the remake big time.  The Acting here is so much more convinceing (at least I think so...they talk Dutch) and I felt scared when the nightwatchman was scared...he's kinda buff, so I felt like he could whoop butt unlike the sissy american actor so when was scared I was.
The direction in this version was better because it gives you the feeling someone is alway watching you and a more clastrphobic feel to this version that the american one lacks.
See this if you want a good mystery/suspence/thriller for a movie going experiance.
WARINING:
If you hate subtitles then stay clear.",1002067200,12,705,4.67741935483871
1373642,5,B00004Y6BM,"This will have you on the edge of your seat! Although I haven't seen the remake (and I refuse to watch it) I don't see the need to change an already brilliant film. Just imagine yourself in the place of the student doing a part-time job as a nightwatch in a morgue of a hospital, with strange things happening when you're all alone (or so you think)! Together with The Vanishing (also the original (Dutch/French) version), a brilliant example of truely scary European thrillers that don't need a remake.",993859200,4,503,4.662921348314606
1373643,5,B00004Y6BM,"If you were a fan of ""Nightwatch,"" the 1998 movie released through Dimension Films (the same company that cursed us with the ""Scream"" trilogy) and concerning the exploits of a necrophiliac serial killer who menaces a law student during his shift as nightwatchman at a lonley medical building, you'd be doing yourself a huge favor to check out writer-director Ole Bornedal's 1994 original (in Danish w/English subtitles).
It's puzzling to think why a thriller so fluid in pacing, atmospheric in fright and tight in story would need to be remade in the first place, but the only reason I can think of is: To make it more accessible to an American audience.  Bob & Harvey Weinstein probably put a huge sum of cash in front of Bornedal's face and told him: ""Remake your movie, shot by shot, line by line, but...for the kids!  For the 'hip' crowd, let Steven Soderbergh collaborate on the script!""  All of this sunk the remake of ""Nightwatch"" like a lead balloon.  The result came off as clunky, belabored, and soulless--a disjointed attempt to allow style to trample substance, without much success.  Good performances from Josh Brolin and Nick Nolte couldn't cover up the overall triviality of the whole project.
Now finally, after years of deliberation (on Miramax's part, I'm guessing), the gods of video at Anchor Bay have released the 1994 original and it's nothing short of stunning.  Digitally remastered with a pseudo-letterbox presentation, this is art-house Euro-horror shown in its purest form.  Bornedal's vision clearly foreshadowed David Fincher's subsequent 1995 masterpiece, ""Seven,"" and carved out a space in the popular serial-killer subgenre.
What's unfortunate about the original ""Nightwatch"" being released to video is that persons who saw the remake will pretty much see all the events in advance because the scripts--I kid you not--are nearly identical.  Even so, the nuances of this version--atmosphere, acting, pace--are so incredibly top-notch that the 1998 film will become an easily-dismissable afterthought.
If you're looking for a foreign horror film without the exploitation trimmings, ""Nightwatch"" is one of the best out there.",991180800,6,2155,5.262390670553936
1373644,5,B00004Y6BM,"This movie has it all. It makes you shiver, it has a great plot, that I won't spoil, a great(!!) soundtrack (in English) and superior humour. The American version with Nick Nolte did not do any great favours for Ole Bornedal or this movie. OK so it is a Danish movie, where the spoken lanuage is Danish. If you can read, then you may still watch this great movie as it has subtitles in English.",987897600,6,394,4.266666666666667
1373645,4,B00004Y6BM,"I was Lucky enough to catch ""Nightwatch"" during it's LIMITED (did I emphasize that word enough) Theatrical Run, and I have always believed it was Unjustly Critisized. As it was a remake of a Foreign film, it should have expected such critisism. (see Sly's ""Get Carter"" and Jeff Bridges ""The Vanishing"" for Example)
Ewan Mcgregors American Career had just taken off, and he was still largely unknown, hopefully now - Post ""Phantom Menace"" -  this little thriller will get the recognition it deserves.
Good Premise, good Scares, good Stars, (Nick Nolte) good Supporting, (Josh Brolin and Patricia Arquette) good Everything.",982281600,,621,5.21

7927172,5,B00004Y6BM,"I always like finding foreign movies to watch that I want to watch, now that I have an all-region dvd player.  Even though the movie was made into an American movie which I watched after watching this one, it seems the original version is always better.  This being the case here as well.",1379462400,,288,4.415094339622642
7927173,5,B00004Y6BM,"Gosh - this certainly kept me on the edge of my chair, and not many ""thrillers"" do that !! Very atmospheric and although at the end one realizes it is a simple plot, the presentation is incredible - liked the thread of rather bleak humour also !!",1374192000,,246,4.25531914893617
7927174,5,B00004Y6BM,"With normal shipment, the DVD arrived in just a few day, in great condition and in an odd, thick DVD case.
There were no scratches on the DVD, and no flaws as it played great.

There were a few stickers inside and out.  One that worried me was one asking the DVD be rewound before being returned to the rental place.  Well, it was obvious the DVD was not rewound, and they shipped the used DVD without rewinding it first before shipping it to me.  Just a shame.

Not that it is possible to rewind a DVD (unlike a tape, but this was a DVD case).  They should not ask the impossible unless they plan to attempt it them selves.

Fast Shipping & Used DVD was in great condition, but not rewound before they ship to you.  Highly recommended.",1358812800,,736,4.244604316546763
7927175,5,B00004Y6BM,"Really loved this movie, while not being a big fan of horror movies I found this one to be scary, but not in the sick and unrealistic way so many of them are. It is one that you could really see happen to some one and for me that makes it more terrifying. Will admit that I picked the movie because of the lead actor in the film Nickolaj Coster-Waldau. My husband is Danish and we lived in Denmark for a few years and love to watch the Scandinavian movies. In the watching of these movies I found him to be a very good actor who can take you from one movie to the next and you believe in each of his characters.

For people who are not big fans of foreign films you do not know what you are missing, reading the sub-titles do not in anyway take from the film and most times when it is remade in the US it is not as real or as dark as it should be with the glossy way we do so many of our films.",1355011200,4,894,3.8324324324324324
7927176,4,B00004Y6BM,"Martin's a happy go lucky kid with a cute girlfriend and fun-loving friends.  But when he takes a part-time job as nightwatchman in a hospital morgue, he suddenly finds himself beset with creepy visions and twisted desires.  And to make things worse, someone is brutally murdering local prostitutes and Martin is the prime suspect.  Although this film was remade (1998) in English with Nick Nolte and Patricia Arquette, ""Nattevagten"" is the real deal.  A huge hit in Denmark and Europe.  This is a classy, stylish and sinister exercise in horror.  far superior to the American remake.  Bonus material includes a self-deprecating, somewhat mordant commentary from writer-director Ole Bornedal. In Danish with optional English subtitles.  From Anchor Bay, 1994.",1278979200,,759,5.372881355932203
7927177,5,B00004Y6BM,"This movie is so horrifying that sometimes really get freaked out when I see it. Particularly that song. I can't even see the actor that played the bad guy as anything else.

I'm from Denmark where this movie was originaly made, and there are not many movies which are so high in calibre as this one.

I think we make pretty good movies. The US have made remakes of many of our movie like: Catch that kid(Klatretsen), Nightwatch(Nattevagten) and many more. So give movies you from Europe a change, they maybe surprise you.",1133481600,,522,4.602150537634409
7927178,5,B00004Y6BM,"Definately better then anything that could be made in America, this Danish thriller is scary and funny and just about everything you could want in a great movie. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Martin is amazing, making the viewer able to feel how truely terrified he is when he sees disturbing things happening at the mourge he is working at.

Subtitles are a girl's best friend.",1125705600,3,373,4.828125
7927179,4,B00004Y6BM,"A law student, Martin, wants to make it on his own without the help from his mother, which leads him to acquire a night job in a morgue.  It is a job that keeps Martin on his toes as he is fearful of the atmosphere with the dead people around him.  During one of Martin's night shifts the police bring in a victim from a serial-killer, and strange occurrences begin to happen in the morgue.  Can these occurrences have something to do with Martin's dare-game that he is playing with his friend Jens, who also is a law student, or is it something else that is after him.  Nightwatch is a suspenseful film that uses camera angles that maximize the situational terror and push the audience to experience the same fear that Martin is experiencing in the film.  This leaves the audience with a cinematic happening that produces chills and horror, and which is of good quality.",1077494400,3,871,4.522292993630574
