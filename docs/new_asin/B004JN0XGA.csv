8650808,5,B004JN0XGA,"I truly loved and enjoyed this documentary. It sheds light on a very important issue in our society, and how the government is still attempting to eradicate this beautiful culture and people. I used to live in the area of Bayside and Little Neck, so it hit very close to home, and made me SO upset that things like this are still happening. I hope this documentary is seen far and wide so hopefully some change can happen.",1403481600,,422,4.423076923076923
8650809,4,B004JN0XGA,We don't realize that Urban Indians may be because a city has grown up around them instead of moving to a city during the relocation programs.  I'd like to use this for education programs.,1347926400,2,188,4.529411764705882
