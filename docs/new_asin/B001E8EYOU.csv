It's more of a hip mellower Warren Miller snowboard movie. Mellow anouncer, the rider's are cool, and funny and the music is the best soundtrack for a snowboard movie that I've ever heard. I never heard of these bands when I first watched it. I found myself singing the songs driving or working. Bands like Filter, Monster Magnet, No Use for a Name, and a lot more great bands that you just don't see headlining concerts, but should.  THUMBS UP!!!! Worth converting to dvd or just keeping the old vhs around.",1252022400,,673,4.516393442622951
