8179240,2,B0007XBM52,"I couldn't concentrate on the exercises and what muscles do what due to  the white noise chatter, it made it hard to focus , it took too long between exercises and the instruction could have been  more thorough and to the point. The workout on its own was okay at best.",1401408000,,269,4.254901960784314
8179241,3,B0007XBM52,"This is the best pilates DVD I have seen, insofar as explaining the overall Pilates method, and the specific form and techniques for each stretch.  The instructor is extremely articulate, with a soothing, quiet voice and nearly ethereally calm presence. If you want to learn precision, this video is for you.  That being said, the video is long, with a lot of exercises but few reps of each exercise.  I don't find it to be a real break-a-sweat type of workout, but I use it sometimes to break up the monotony of other workouts.",1299888000,3,528,4.595744680851064
8179242,5,B0007XBM52,"I have be using weights for over 25 years and this floor exercise was very intense...even panting after a while....and yes, sweating.
This is a floor exercise, that I was amazed would get me. Not the next day but the day after
So, if you are really looking for a good workout, try this. It is not for the faint of heart",1273190400,3,319,4.161290322580645
8179243,1,B0007XBM52,"In all fairness, the technique and pilates approach in this dvd appears to be sound. But I cannot get past her awful, high pitched monotone rhythmic cadence she feels is necessary to coach one through the movements. It is like listening to some sort of new age shaman or cult leader, and the sound is absolutely nausating. I have taken two of her dvds to the Goodwill because I cannot get past it.  Blech...",1243728000,3,407,4.5
8179244,5,B0007XBM52,"If you want a true Pilates workout, then Stott is the way to go.  Stott follows the Joseph Pilates way of training where if you bend them forward, you must bend them backwards.  This is where a lot of pilates programs fail...they forget the backwards part.  Stick with Stott...they are the gold standard and the only video I will recommend to my clients.",1237420800,5,354,4.587301587301587
8179245,4,B0007XBM52,"I would have given this dvd 5 stars but for 2 reasons. 1. The warmup is  a little on the long side and 2. it doesnt flow. I'm used to doing Jennifer Kries Method dvd's. Her way of teaching has a certain flow to it. Although Moira has a gentle way of teaching, in some sections you go from laying on your back to all fours to back on the back to on the stomach without any sense of connection between the moves. This dvd doesnt have that flowing feel to it. The workout is hard though. Its definately a good one. It's not for beginners either. This workout is also a bit rushed. Not in a bad way though. I get the sense that I'm there to workout and go about my day, whereas some other dvds take too much time in between exercises to explain the pose. This dvd assumes you already know the reason behind the pose and takes you right through. Dont expect too much down time on this one. Enjoy!",1164844800,6,891,4.091428571428572
8179246,4,B0007XBM52,"Moira Stott does things her own way. She does not do Pilates matwork in the traditional order. She also adds in a few variations. The pace is slow and deliberate. There is a long prep period. It can sometimes get in the way of the workout because it takes 15 minutes before you begin the workout proper, but the exercises are well instructed and illustrated. She also leaves out a few exercises in the advanced Pilates repetoire such as the leg pull back, the boomerang, the high scissors and the high bicycle. That surprised me because this is a Level 4 workout which is supposed to be very advanced. She apparently feels that they are beyond the abilities of most home exercisers. However, the video does include an excellent side bend/twist sequence. All in all a good effort, but it is missing a few moves. You do need a lot of upper body and core strength to complete this workout. It is definitely not for beginners. Strong intermediates should be able to do most, if not all, of it.",1128902400,26,989,4.5307262569832405
8179247,5,B0007XBM52,"I have been searching for a truly advanced DVD for a long time...

While I am fairly new to Pilates, I am not new to exercising nor to exercise DVD purchasing. I have gotten used to many DVDs preaching that they are advanced level and being sorely disappointed. So, while I am more of an intermediate level in Pilates, I purchased the advanced one, expecting a watered down version of an intermediate level course. I have been pleasantly surprised by this challenging DVD which provides an excellent work-out and will challenge me for a while. I will definitely purchase more DVDs from this series. My recommendation for viewers is if you are new/intermediate, purchase the appropriate level. The advanced level rightly skips excessive instruction and proceeds directly into the moves.",1127779200,32,785,5.038461538461538
8179248,5,B0007XBM52,"Honestly, I have to give her 4 1/2 stars for not smiling, but I am SO thankful for this level of challenge! If you want a challenge this is it.  I'm a personal trainer and this is a favorite of my collection.  Did I mention challenging?  If you are interested in working your way up to this advanced level, here are my suggestions:

Yoga Plus (by denise Austin)EASY

Intermediate Pilates (by Gaiam)NOT TO HARD

On the Ball (Natural Journeys)  FUN!

Pilate for Every Body (by Denise) more challengeing

Then, this DVD

Hope this helps!",1121299200,41,534,4.585106382978723
