8602978,4,B00E9HPV22,"I could give this a three star rating, because I find I am more impressed with this priest than with this documentary about his life.  The substance of the documentary is mostly about the places he served and a couple of the miracles attributed to him, with only brief mention that many more are attributed to him.  People did throng to him for confession and to his funeral, so he must have had a deep personal relationship with the Lord.  But any depth of presentation about that relationship (and how it developed) is missing .... mainly just the fact that many came, he blessed them, and miracles happened.  Perhaps this lack is because he did not keep a personal journal and/or did not speak much with others about his spirituality ... both of which can actually be good signs of genuine depth in his spiritual life.  We know he read the scriptures and prayed a lot, even well into the night.",1449619200,2,897,4.546583850931677

8602981,5,B00E9HPV22,"A remarkable documentary of heroism, joy, humility and commitment to God, the life of Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos is not only inspiring and uplifting but gripping as well. Born in an obscure little town in Germany, a sickly boy that even his mother thought that he would not see adulthood, only goes to prove how God chooses the most unremarkable  and inconspicuous souls to be the heralds of His divine love. For this sickly boy would mature to be an excellent student and after a remarkable spiritual experience, was filled with the pioneer spirit that would bring him to the United States to minister to the wave of new immigrants that came to these shores.

Departing from the pattern of other documentaries regarding Saints, this one begins with 2 astounding miracles, the latter of which was instrumental in his beatification process. There are interviews with the beneficiaries of these said miracles and the medical professionals who worked with them. From there we're taken into the history of Blessed Seelos, his upbringing, education his days in the US and most importantly we learn about the incredible joy with which he was imbibed as well as the miracles that surrounded him when he walked this earth., and the other spiritual and mystical gifts with which he was blessed.

Also there are more testimonies of the continuing efficacious intercession of this Blessed, both spiritual and corporeal.

The lessons that one can learn here is the importance of a REAL vocation to the priesthood, of living out this calling with a sense of joy and reckless abandonment to Divine Providence as well as having the spirit of humility and mercy without compromising the truths of the Gospel; a life that is essentially that of the sacred priesthood which is a life of Sacrifice, in the spirit, manner and pattern of Jesus Christ. And in Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos, from what we study and gather from this documentary, we have an excellent example of this exact pattern.

This would be a great gift to get for any man contemplating a call to the holy Priesthood.

This documentary is 68 minutes long, in ENGLISH, WITHOUT subtitles, special features or a scene/chapter selection.",1380758400,7,2184,4.953551912568306
