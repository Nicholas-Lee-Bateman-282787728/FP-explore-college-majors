Amazon has found several film you could never find with anyone else at prices that are realistic eg, this one. Topkapi,  and Dark at the top of the stairs, even though it was a VHS tx to dvd",1259280000,,350,4.17910447761194

8128356,5,B000G1GAWU,"I've been waiting years to see this movie again since I caught it on late night TV.  Unfortunately, it was only on VHS, which not many people still have.  Can't wait to show it to friends.",1247875200,,188,4.194444444444445
8128357,5,B000G1GAWU,"Compelling classic film for ages 8 up about a mother and son searching for each other after World War II.  Those children at the younger end of the spectrum might need a small amount of clarification to understand the scope of the film. I had seen it at 8 years of age and never forgot it. I just watched it for the first time since then with my grandchildren, 9 years and 13 years, and we all sat mesmerized to the final ""sit on the edge of your seat"" minute. It is both educational and heart wrenching.",1228003200,6,504,4.195876288659794
8128358,5,B000G1GAWU,This is a great story of the misery of war on families/children.  Clift is wonderful...and the young star has such talent...too bad he didn't do more work and died without more exposure of his talent.,1226361600,,200,4.714285714285714
8128359,5,B000G1GAWU,"I waited many years for this brilliant movie to come out on DVD and must confess that I was rather disappointed in the overall quality of the transfer.  It is almost better to watch it on video as at least the pictures seem to be more stable...  a great shame, for this is a truly wonderful and touching movie with Montgomery Clift at the height of his talent.",1221523200,8,360,4.279411764705882
8128360,1,B000G1GAWU,"This DVD was defective.  The movie was great, what I got to see of it before it complete stopped.  I returned it to the return address over a month ago and have received no responce since then.",1213833600,5,193,4.1891891891891895
8128361,5,B000G1GAWU,"A heart warming, feel good story with superb acting.  Child actor Ivan Jandl won the Acadeny Award for best child actor.  Montgomery Clift fans will not want to miss this one.",1202774400,8,175,4.612903225806452
8128362,5,B000G1GAWU,"What can I say? I've watched this film 5 times since I received it in the mail last week and it always leaves me in tears. Karel is one of many displaced children in post WW2 Germany searching for his Mother (played by opera singer Jarmila Novotna with resolve and stoicism like no other). She in turn is searching for him, refusing to believe the American Embassy when they tell her he has drowned. Montgomery Clift, in his screen debut, plays Ralph ""Steve"" Stevenson, an American G.I. who finds Karel, takes him in and teaches him English in order to take him back to the States to start a new life.

Clift is brilliant...the first method actor preceding Dean and Brando...and his Chemistry with the young Karel (actor Ivan Jandl, who won a special Oscar for his performance) is both sensitive and hilarious all at once. Check out the scene where Clift is trying to make the boy give him a simple yes or no answer to his questions ~ it's priceless! Your loyalties shift throughout the picture. You want Karel to remain safe with Steve but you also want him to reunite with his mother. The ending will have you both in suspense and in tears! Bust out the Kleenex box...this film is a classic tearjerker...and PERFECT!",1164153600,35,1218,4.587155963302752
