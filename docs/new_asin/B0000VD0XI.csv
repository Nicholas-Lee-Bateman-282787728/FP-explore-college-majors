1953807,3,B0000VD0XI,"I am a fan of Dr. Stephen Turnbull, have many of his books, and love Japanese history and also enjoy their military history.  So getting this DVD was a given.  With that said, I have to warn you, this is a 44 minute DVD that should have been at least 120 minutes.  They rush through Samurai culture, history and tradition at a neck break speed and they do so while being very detailed.  In order to keep up you have to know a lot of Japanese history and military history to begin with.  People who know nothing about the Samurai or Japanese history should start someplace else.
In other words, if you know the history you don't really need the DVD.  And if you don't know the history the DVD will very likely overwhelm you with names, dates, places and so on.",1238371200,22,759,4.309859154929577
1953808,5,B0000VD0XI,I found this DVD very well produced and very informative.  It was well researched and the use of some classic movie footage added to the veiwing experience.,1237334400,,156,4.777777777777778
1953809,5,B0000VD0XI,"This is not an all singing, all dancing ""action adventure"" movie with big celebrities like Tom Cruise etc in like ""The Last Samurai"", but to my mind and anyone that is interested in what the Samurai were; how, when and why they came into existence, Japanese history and the importance of the Samurai Code in today's modern world, then this has to be the best documentary on the market to understand the heart, soul and spirit of the Samurai.

Presented by two of the greatest leading figures on the subject; Dave Lowry & Dr Stephen Turnbull turn what would have possibly been a dull, dry history lesson into a fascinating and colourful story. It's not just ""talking heads"" either, there's plenty of short clips from movies like ""The Last Samurai"" and ""Shogun"" to keep you riveted all the way through.

WARNING!! UK viewers - Please make sure that your DVD can play with Region 1 DVD's and that your TV is NTSC compatible first.

If you enjoy this do look out for NOVA's: ""Secrets of the Samurai Sword"" which is also a REGION 1 + NTSC DVD. This video explains the intricate details of how a Samurai sword is made from start to finish - 6 months and 15 men later.",1222300800,34,1161,4.492890995260663
1953810,4,B0000VD0XI,"There seems to be some major confusion about these two similar titles - SAMURAI: The last Warrior narrated by Dr. Stephen Turnbull and SAMURAI: The last Warriors hosted by David Carradine Even the distributors seem to have these titles confused and no one can really say which one they are selling. I have the one by Dr. Stephen Turnball (the last Warrior) and it was very informative but would love to get the other title hosted by David Carradine but cannot seem to find a seller who knows what copy they have. If anyone out there in movie land knows where I can get the one hosted by David Carradine SAMURAI: The Last Warriors I would appreciate it if you could contact me at [...]
Thank you

1953811,3,B0000VD0XI,"It seems that the creators of this documentary could not decide on a target audience.  I have studied Japanese history and found the contents of the documentary rather superficial. My family, however, have a rudimentary knowledge of Japanese culture and found the presentation somewhat confusing. They are not familiar with the names of Japanese historical figures or the historical significance of the battles discussed in the film, so it was a bit difficult for them to make the connections of names and places repeated throughout the commentary.

That being said, we are using the confusion of the film as motivation to learn more about the individual samurai/shogun/daimyo and the battles mentioned so that all will make sense upon our next viewing of the DVD.  So, YES, it is worth watching multiple times!",1201651200,21,811,5.128787878787879
1953812,5,B0000VD0XI,"Excellent documentary, on par with the best of History Channel or A&E productions.  Perhaps the only, definitive history of these valiant warriors, from their historic emergence, to their place in folklore.  Highly recommended.",1172361600,6,227,5.848484848484849
1953813,4,B0000VD0XI,"On watching this documentry, i found it very informative and learned alot about Japanes culture. If you are interested in the life of the samuria this is a very good dvd to buy.",1163116800,4,177,4.393939393939394

8003803,1,B0000VD0XI,"The producer of this film should apologize to the viewers who purchased this fraudulent video.  Much of the footage is taken from the movie ""Ran"" and TV mini series ""Shogun"", and there is a captioned portion at the bottom of the screen acknowledging this.  Other ""scenes of Japan"", however, are of the Island of Kaua'i in the State of Hawai'i in the USA.  The rice paddies are of the Hanalei Valley, and some of the mountain scenes are of the valleys of Kalalau & Hanapepe, all on the Island of Kaua'i in Hawai'i.  Then, of course, there are the tropical white sand beach scenes featuring palm trees--not even similar to Japanese shorelines, but somehow included to expand the running time.  The segement with Hanalei bay in October/November looks like it was thrown in by the Hawai'i Visitors Bureau. It appears that this was put together as a joke, a parody of legitimate documentaries, but the producers could not afford to go to Japan proper for their footage, and took tropical Hawai'i as ""close enough"".  The content itself is rudimentary, the pronunciation of Japanese terms and names not even close, and anyone contemplating purchasing this would be well advised to look elsewhere.  I sincerely hope that the people interviewed were not party to the parody/deception, and are innocent of complicity in this travesty.",1374710400,2,1324,4.936936936936937
8003804,5,B0000VD0XI,I can't wait to watch and learn from the DVD what I don't know about Samurai. I think this DVD would rock.,1358812800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8003805,5,B0000VD0XI,"I bought this DVD, having read works by Stephen Turnbull on Japanese warfare, expecting a well-made documentary on the Samurai and the warrior tradition in Japan and I was not disappointed. Mr. Turnbull and Dave Lowry, two of the foremost Western experts on Japanese warfare, lend their expertise to this production.

The DVD covers the entire Samurai era from its early beginnings as mounted warriors whose primary weapon was the bow (something I have not seen in other documentaries) through to the end of the Samurai era in the Meiji Restoration and the advent of mass armies using western-style gunpowder weapons.

The video does a fine job of detailing the changes in weapons and armor as well as a little bit of the tactics. It covers the major wars and conflicts which produced the Tokugawa Shoganate. The major battles such as Sekigahara are covered reasonably well. Inter views with Turnbull and Lowry are very useful in introducing the concepts of ritual suicide, the bonds that tied Samurai to their Daimyo, the desire on the part of Samurai to make battles into many contests between ""worthy opponents"" and other topics to the viewer.

As one can expect, weapons are covered very well with the sword taking pride of place but also touching on the bow and spear. Armor is covered in like fashion from the very heavy armor worn when Samurai fought mainly on horseback to the lighter, more flexible lamellar armor.

This is a very entertaining and informative video worth the price of purchase. I recommend this DVD with five stars.",1343520000,2,1541,4.89272030651341

8003807,1,B0000VD0XI,I've written three times to vendor (Indie Film Circuit) since receiving my shipping notice and never received a reply much less the product or a refund.,1283731200,,152,4.884615384615385
8003808,4,B0000VD0XI,"If you are a fan of Japanese culture and history then I would like to recommend the documentary.  There is some great info here and Tom Cruise has absolutely nothing to do with it. Matter a fact if you like Tom Cruise you probably won't like this doc. That being said I found the Crab's with the face of a dead Samurai Warrior on their backs quite fascinating. There is also very good info about specific Samurai though out history and the role they played in Japanese history. Please if you are into Japan by all means check this out.
Have a nice day. :)",1278806400,,555,4.285714285714286
