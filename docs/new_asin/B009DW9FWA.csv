8540511,1,B009DW9FWA,It will not play in the DVD player. It is in German. It was not noted on the order that it was a German version when we ordered it. Son is special needs and it does NOT play closed captions either. Volume 1 has most words in English but he's very disappointed and complains daily about the play-ability of it.,1437091200,,309,4.166666666666667
