I was expecting Christmas music with the other scenes but there was not there was just this repeated very annoying rhythm  that drove everyone crazy.  It was not even a Rhythm from a Christmas song.  I would not recommend",1514246400,,321,4.338983050847458
8369501,4,B002FPWQ2S,"The patterns are bright and entertaining. Unfortunately, the picture quality is not the best; this would look so much prettier in high definition so I hope they release an HD version. The video is somewhat amateurishly put together, but it is still fun for the holidays to play in the background. The patterns are unique and really puts you in the holiday mood.",1328140800,3,361,4.746031746031746

This really bridges this gap in a colorful visual way. As you can see from the video I found it will be the perfect tv background to light up the season via your screens. The DVD auto loops so when you choose a file it will play all night long. The disc includes a Fire place and a Red Green Christmas Lava Lamp as Bonus clips, again they auto loop so lots of fun for under $10, what a deal!",1253836800,8,883,6.620689655172414
