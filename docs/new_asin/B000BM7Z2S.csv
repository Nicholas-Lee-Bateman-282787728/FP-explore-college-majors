8088743,3,B000BM7Z2S,This is just clips from pre-released instruction videos.  I wasn't impressed and would rather seek out the original footage from each of these drummers.,1373328000,,152,5.333333333333333
8088744,1,B000BM7Z2S,This DVD is a piece of junk. It consists of 5 minute lessons taken from each drummers full DVD.  These DVD's are old footage from VHS tapes. The sound quality and picture quality are terrible and the lessons are stupid. Just a couple of licks from the 80's and techniques that won't help you accomplish anything. You would learn more buying one copy of DRUM magazine.,1355529600,2,367,4.5606060606060606
