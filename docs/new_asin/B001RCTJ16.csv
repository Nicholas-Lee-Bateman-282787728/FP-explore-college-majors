8337695,5,B001RCTJ16,"I watched this DVD first as a library borrowed item, then I have decided to buy it, even if it is quite expensive. I looked at it as a business investment - a trip in the Canadian Rockies is (for most people) a once in a lifetime event, and a family trip is not going to be cheap. So research and planning is critical for a successful vacation. And this DVD does an excellent job in this respect. Compared to a trip cost, this is a small investment. And there is another reason I bought it - it presents Canada's premier mountain region - Banff, Jasper, Lake Louise, etc. If it would be a region of Canada that I will present to an interested foreign tourist, it will be the Rockies. For these reasons I gave a 5 star rating, even if the technical execution is not the best: the sound seems to be recorded in studio rather then at the same time and place with filming. This makes the DVD a bit flat, it lacks certain rythm that other DVDs on travel have. Also, the transition between scenes/chapters seems a bit steep, like the filming was done at very different times- the execution of the video gives the impression that there are multiple stories, not one story.
But, if one chooses content over form, the DVD is worth the money.",1386374400,,1232,4.337662337662338
