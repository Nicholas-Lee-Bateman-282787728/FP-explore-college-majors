I do recommend, however, before watching Panda-Z, watch the anime/read the manga (if you manage to track it down) it was based on, since it does take quite some liberties when making fun of the source material. Also, unless you want the little 3"" toy that came with the original Volume 1, buy the whole collection at the lowest price possible. Trust me, it's not worth spending 6-15 dollars for each SEPARATE 30-minute DVD.

Anyway, I love Panda-Z. It's fun, it's also a good tool for me to learn to read Japanese, and I'm sure nobody at home would dare take it without my permission... because it bores them to death! Hahaha! Like I said, it's an acquired taste.",1330041600,,918,4.695652173913044
