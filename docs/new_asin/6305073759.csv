Overall however, this is a poor product.  It has the feel of a much longer story chopped to fit onto two tapes.  There are huge gaps in the story.  Characters are introduced with no rythme or reason.  The action jumps from place to place erratically.  Sometimes the story becomes almost incoherent.  It has all the standard earmarks of indiscriminately hacked anime.  I would reccomend you rent this one before considering buying it.  A major video rental chain with the initials BBV carries it.",984960000,,640,4.88785046728972
7883721,3,6305073759,"I didn't like this movie too much. It's obviously a fairly good sci-fi anime, but I didn't feel it was TOO much to hoot and holler about. With so many great movies out there, I'm afraid Maps just doesn't compete. I figure  that a lot of people would find this movie entertaining, so it's probably  worth your time, but as for my opinion, all I can say is this: I wouldn't  want to watch this again, and if you're already hooked on something else,  this will probably seem insulting to you. And parents, don't be fooled by  the PG rating. They messed up. This movie is in NO WAY PG. I had to turn it  off in the middle because my little brother was freaking out.",960681600,,661,4.2063492063492065
