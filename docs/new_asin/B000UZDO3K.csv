2927728,5,B000UZDO3K,"Without a doubt, this is the best musical biography ever made! Susan Hayward worked closely with Jane Froman, studying her gestures, delivery, and style. The two became close friends in the course of the project. The result is a seamless lip-synching of songs by Hayward over the most perfect mezzo voice of Ms. Froman. (The voice is an instrument with perfect vibrato.)

Thelma Ritter was nominated for an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress and delivers a tremendous performance as Nurse Clancey. She was a very special actress!

The combination of songs from a variety of composers is stellar. The dance production for ""With a Song in My Heart"" is gorgeous and simply soars! The strings are marvelous, and the male dance lead is brilliant.

I thought I was destined to enjoy this classic only on a grainy VHS recording made from a TV broadcast. Thank goodness for a restored DVD! I can hardly wait for my copy to arrive. Then I, too, will have a song in MY heart!",1188604800,28,963,4.686390532544379
2927729,5,B000UZDO3K,"Upon first seeing this movie as an early teenager, I knew there was something unique about Jane Froman's voice.  Over the years, I've come to believe that her courage in dealing with incredible obstacles and pain is what I hear in that voice!
It was exciting to see this movie again on cable about 20 years ago and now after more that 50 years, we will be able to own it and watch it anytime.  It is being released for what would have been Jane Froman's 100th birthday, which will be celebrated by her fans in Columbia, Missouri, November 9-11, 2007. For fans who want to know more details about Ms. Froman's life and how the story ended, Barbara Seuling's biography of Ms. Froman, ""Say It With Music"" will also be published this November.",1187913600,13,739,4.507462686567164
2927730,5,B000UZDO3K,"I first saw ""With a Song in my Heart"" when I was 12 years old.  I was so enthralled by Jane Froman's voice and her story that I saw the movie 14 times.  The movie was my first introduction to the beautiful old standards such as Blue Moon, Tea for Two, Embraceable You, and I'll Walk Alone.  I have been a fan of Jane Froman's since 1952 and have only had the opportunity to see the movie on a video that I recorded from the TV set.  I look forward to the release of the movie on DVD so that I can enjoy a professional version of this inspiring movie.",1187827200,26,550,3.9727272727272727
2927731,5,B000UZDO3K,"Susan Hayward gives a superb performance as heroic singer Jane Froman( Froman 's sultry voice is used in the soundtrack),the score,Froman's voice and the songs are a delight sets,direction and costumes too,the technicolor photography ,if restaured, will pay full tribute to Susan Hayward's exquisite redheaded beauty,with her flamboyant auburns hair  and her highly spiritual face.

More than Rita Hayworth,Clara Bow,Maureen o'Hara or even Lucille Ball, Susan Hayward should be regarded as THE hollywood redhead of her era cause she was both a great beauty and a magnificent actress who could also  dance  and sing  (superbly as in ""I'll cry tomorrow"" ,1955) .

Hopefully 20 century Fox will release more titles on DVD starring Hayward ,in the very near future -she made 16 movies for Fox,most of  them big hits - and she was one of the biggest box office stars of the fifties.

She totally  deserves a DVD boxed set with 5 or 6 of her great movies for Fox....and I am not the only one to wonder what 20 Century Fox is waiting for to do that ,since they release boxed sets of less prestigious and popular  stars than Susan Hayward!!!

If there's one star of the golden era who deservrs a BIG revival : it is Susan .",1187827200,18,1215,4.738095238095238
2927732,5,B000UZDO3K,"Finally the voice of the superb Jane Froman has been released on this wonderful home video! Truly the greatest American singer! And what a selection of songs in the most exciting musical arrangements that she ever recorded!
This movie depicts Jane Froman's life from the time of her early radio career up through 1945, the time of her USO tours, two years after her plane crash.
Jane Froman worked on the film set as technical advisor, and the result was that this probably was the most factual of the Hollywood biographies of that time period.
Susan Hayward, Thelma Ritter, David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, Una Merkel are superb in their roles. Robert Wagner's first film appearance. Robert Easton has the comic role of a Kansas soldier who didn't know who Eisenhower was and who was one of a group of soldiers who go AWOL to follow Jane Froman throughout Europe. (Yes, this really happened.)
Buy this movie for the ultimate Froman and Hayward experience!",1187827200,12,950,4.8343558282208585
2927733,5,B000UZDO3K,"I'm jumping the gun; this film won't be available for another three months, but I honestly felt ""With A Song In My Heart"" would never be released in any format, this November release being its first.  My understanding was that there were so many obstacles created by the myriad of songs and composers used throughout the film that being able to one day own this film might be an impossibility.  I saw this movie in l952 with my grandmother.  I was nine years old.  I don't know that I knew who Susan Hayward was at the time (though I loved movie magazines) and I certainly didn't know who Jane Froman was.  Well, the movie has remained, all of these years later, one of my favorites; I've only been able to catch it on AMC, Turner, or HBO or Showtime from time to time.  The film, all of these years later, remains fresh and affecting; Susan Hayward's performance is a classic, the music has become part of our American heritage, the costumes still stun, and this deeply affecting musical biography will only help to reignite interest in Miss Hayward and Miss Froman.  I can't wait to order my copy!",1187568000,45,1099,4.52020202020202
2927744,5,B000UZDO3K,"The movie is one of my favorites and I am completely happy with it. Susan Hayward is brilliant in her Jane Froman role and the scenes with the military are absolutely wonderful. The music is so uplifting. Love this movie!

The story I can not judge because I have not known Jane Froman. The extras in various people telling something about Jane Froman. There are no moving pictures of Jane Froman! All very strange.

I haven't seen this movie for years, but a cast member of the Palm Springs Follies mentioned that he had been in ""Pal Joey"" with Jane Froman which reminded me of the movie. I decided to get it. The movie stimulated me to look into building a Jane Froman playlist to play on my long weekend commutes. Thanks to this movie, I have discovered how truly wonderful she was and have collected a lot of her songs for my playlist. The movie only touches on a fraction of what this amazing woman accomplished.",1376438400,3,796,4.2368421052631575

After numerous surgeries on her crushed leg and months of depression, she decided to complete her USO tour on crutches. Her bravery encouraged wounded soldiers to carry on as well.  Susan Hayward, who plays the lead role, studied and worked with Froman herself so that Froman's voice and Hayward's actions are accurately synchronized.

2927851,5,B000UZDO3K,"The career and life of singer-actress Jane Froman was beautifully written for the screen by Lamar Trotti, with a great deal of Miss Froman's input.  She was also portrayed most winningly by Academy Award nominee Susan Hayward (she won the Best Actress Oscar a few years later for ""I Want to Live""), who flawlessly lip-synched to Miss Froman's own gorgeous voice on the soundtrack.

I never get tired of watching this film.  It makes me realize just how small my problems are compared to those of really courageous people like Jane Froman.  With faith, courage and strength, she endured what seems beyond human endurance.  She had her ups and downs, but consistently got up to fight again and again.  I marvel at how the film stuck very close to facts, up to the time the film was made.  Even small details were covered in the dialogue.

One of my all-time favorite films, with one of my all-time favorite actresses, portraying a lady who lived her life with grace and gallantry!",1309046400,3,978,4.711764705882353

The entire WWII era was a favorite time because coming from the ""Greatest Generation,"" I love the heart of the American people of that period.  I love remembering that time though I was a child because the people had ethics, patriotism and soul.  If you are nostalgic for a time when America was great. . .you'll love this story about singer Jane Frohman who sings the music in the film.",1308614400,,488,4.388888888888889
2927853,5,B000UZDO3K,"With a Song in My Heart is an excellent old movie.
Susan Hayward is terrific as the star of the film.
It's a wonderful story about a very successful singer.
The music is also great.",1298246400,,181,4.2
2927854,5,B000UZDO3K,"For anyone who likes musicals, this film is especially appealing.  With a Song in My Heart is the story of Jane Froman, a wonderful singer and one of the most courageous performers in United States entertainment history.

Over the years many performers have joined USO tours to entertain the troops.  Jane was especially generous with her time and talent.  Despite severe injures she suffered in a plane crash (39 operations and a continued threat to amputate her leg) she traveled  throughout the World War II European theater and, in crutches, gave 95 performances for the troops.

Susan Hayward stars as Jane and does a great job.  Jane herself does the singing (no one can match her voice), but Susan Hayward beams during the singing and is convincing in the hospital scenes.

Rodgers and Hart wrote the superior musical score.  In addition to the title song, the film includes excellent productions of:  ""That Old Feeling,""  ""I'm Through With  Love,""  ""Blue Moon,""  ""Embraceable You,""  ""It's A Good Day,"" and ""I'll Walk Alone.""

Lavish costumes highlight Jane's performances.  She appears in flowing and beautifully designed gowns that enhance her appearances before the many audiences.

The narration for this movie alternates among the supporting cast of David Wayne, Rory Calhoun, and Thelma Ritter.  David Wayne plays Don Ross, Jane's husband and manager, and provides most of the narration.

Rory Calhoun plays aircrewman John Burn, who is a fellow survivor and convalescent  after the terrible airplane accident that caused Jane's disability.  John becomes her one true love (whom she temporarily gives up for her marriage)

Thelma Ritter portrays nurse Clancy who nurses Jane for the many months of her convalescence.  Clancy is Jane's cheerleader; she keeps Jane together.  Despite her sarcasm, Clancy is  saucy, funny, and a supporting angel.

The wonderful soundtrack, beautiful costumes and superior story of a true artist and gracious person, combined with good acting, make With a Song in My Heart an excellent movie. Although I had seen the movie when it originally was released, I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the high quality production again.  I highly recommend this DVD for fans of popular music and people who enjoy tales of heroism.",1294704000,6,2255,5.188888888888889

2927856,5,B000UZDO3K,"Well, let me say first, that I have watched this film countless times and find it to still be glorious.  Susan's brilliance as an actress is further exemplified with her outstanding interpretation of Jane Froman.  It is almost unbelievalble that it is not really her singing, the dubbing is so good.  With that said, let me say that if you have read the book,"" The Jane Froman Story,""  I can confirm that the glitch at the end of the title song with her costume going awry is absolutely true.  I was quite shocked because it is very evident.  I assume because the number is so elegant, unless you are looking for it, you would never see it, but trust me, it is there.  It is quite astounding that this was not corrected before the film was released.  Anyway, again, the film is so eduring, it is not an obstacle.",1284768000,3,812,4.402684563758389

Nearly 60 years later I saw the movie again from Netflix and was amazed at how well-made this piece was: the acting, the sets and scene design, and especially Jane Froman's singing that Ms Hayward lip synchs flawlessly. I had to purchase the DVD for my collection of very best movies. It it beautifully double packaged and worthy of collecting. The service was excellent. I'm happy.",1279670400,6,576,4.601941747572815
2927859,5,B000UZDO3K,"One night I was going through my music of the 40's and re-discovered Jane Froman singing WITH A SONG IN MY HEART.  After shedding my goosebumps I remembered that it came from an Academy Award movie in my young days.  I did an online search and up it came.  I didn't even dream it was still available.  But Amazon had it.  I ordered it because my very musical granddaughter has grown to love movie music and broadway.  I would love to hear her sing this song.  And what a great way for a young person to piece together some WWII history and showbiz history and radio history at the same time.

Thank you Jane for your music and your commitment to the USA.  Thank you Amazon for having it.

2927876,3,B000UZDO3K,"The film begins with a celebration for newspaper people. Miss Jane Froman sings for them. The story began in Cincinnati with her audition at a radio station. Jane sings with her trained voice and gets a job. Soon she is a star in Chicago. Her manager Don Ross gets her mor money. Next Froman plays at Radio City in New York. Hollywood was next. Froman was now a star. But trouble begins with her husband Don. [Does it seem like the Hollywood version of her life?] Jane Froman volunteers to entertain the troops after Pearl Harbor. A four-engine flying boat takes them to Lisbon. There is a crash landing, and the travelers go to a hospital. Forman's leg was nearly amputated below the knee, an ankle was crushed. But she survived, and returned to New York for more medical treatment.

There is more singing in the hospital. Froman returns to the stage and a hit show. But her leg causes problems and multiple operations. Will her leg have to come off? Will Froman break off her friendship with that co-pilot? Her performance is staged to hide her handicap. Froman returns to Europe to entertain wounded troops in a hospital, and other places. The ending has many songs [like some opera]. The singing and dancing was the hallmark of 20th Century-Fox films. It is a typical Hollywood entertainment that glides over any controversial topic. [Are the lives of today's singers much different?]

An Internet search said Froman had a cut below her left knee that nearly severed her leg. She had a compound fracture of her right leg, and multiple fractures of her right arm. Pilot John Burns held on to her to keep her afloat until the rescue. They later married, but divorced. Jane's father left home when she was five years old, she developed a stutter that vanished when she sang.",1220832000,3,1775,4.685897435897436

In every way Susan Hayward became Jane Froman before the days of the charade called lipsinquing.  It is not a trip back into nostalgia but rather gives us a glimpse of another time and place that shaped the characters of those who lived through those years.

2927883,5,B000UZDO3K,"I must have been about ten when I first saw this film and I never forgot it.  It is a musical feast, but, as my wife would say, without the silliness of characters bursting into song at the drop of a hat.  For those who never heard of Jane Froman, it has been your loss - now you can make up for it.  Ms. Froman was a very talented lady, a real fighter, a true inspiration.  As portrayed by the incomparable Susan Hayward (lip-synching seamlessly), with a familiar cast of characters (check out soldier in her audience twice in a heart-wrenching cameo by a very young Robert Wagner), her story is strong enough to hold the movies together nicely.  But it is the music that makes this film special.  From the title song to BLUE MOON to EMBRACEABLE YOU to I'LL WALK ALONE... well, as they say, the hits just keep on coming - a rich crosssection of the tunes that warmed the hearts of folks in the first half of the 20th century.  Is it dated?  You bet, though the digital version  is amazing.  But the music, the portrayals, the true story are timeless.  And it winds up with about an eight minute gem - a performance for wounded soldiers in Europe (Ms. Froman talked the talk and walked - with difficulty - the walk as she entertained troops tirelessly, fearlessly at the front in WWII).  It includes a recreation of the final performance of her farewell tour for he wounded, medley of state-side songs, from AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL to CHICAGO to MY INDIANA HOME to DEEP IN THE HEART OF TEXAS that will leave some pretty tough cookies with a sorely-needed rush of patriotic adrenaline and embarrassingly moist cheeks.  Square?  You bet!  But for anyone who loves great music and sentimental journeys, WITH A SONG IN MY HEART is a treasure not to be missed.  And don't be surprised if an M&M fan or a Rolling Stones' devotee in the family pokes a head into your television space on hearing a musical passage they may never have heard before - and lingers to hear a little more.  That's entertainment!",1212969600,3,1996,4.484764542936288

2927885,5,B000UZDO3K,"""With a Song in My Heart"" has been my favorite movie since I first saw it in the 50's. However, my husband and I were unable to find it on video or tape until now. We also kept asking about having it put on television, but there has not been a viewing on television for several years. We've been looking for it and waiting for almost twenty years. It's definitely well worth the wait.

""With a Song in My Heart"" is based on a true story about Jane Froman, a beloved, popular American singer who was a survivor of an airplane crash on her way to entertain the troops during World War II. The co-pilot, John Burn, held her head above water or she would not have died in the cold waters of the Tagus River off the coast of Lisbon, Portugal. She lived with the fact that she had changed seats with a passenger who didn't survive the crash. She had horrific injuries that plagued her for years, including almost losing her right leg. It's a very realistic, tear-jerking account of her struggles, strength and determination to triumph over tragedy. Her courage through adversity is heroic. She was an inspiration to the servicemen she entertained.

""Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life."" typifies Jane Froman's response to the challenges she had in life shown in this heart-rendering movie. It's especially enjoyable because Jane Froman sings all the songs in the movie herself. Susan Hayward's excellent portrayal definitely makes this movie a must see, five star movie.",1212192000,3,1487,4.693486590038314

2927890,5,B000UZDO3K,"In ""With A Song In My Heart"" the matchless Susan Hayward is playing a one-dimensional character who has almost nothing to do with the real Jane Froman.  It is amazing how she takes a very shallow but fast-moving and snappy script and somehow conjures up a riveting performance.  In life Jane had many sides. At the University of Missouri she was a popular girl and campus star to whom everything seemed to come easy; few people knew of her difficult life story even at that young age.  She could be fun, she could be quite imperious.  She sang pop songs but sang them like a Wagnerian mezzo soprano.  Her stage demeanor was formal, her private demeanor totally down to earth when she wasn't in a star mood.  She was magnetic, charismatic and even more gorgeous than her photos show.  I think everyone who knew her was fascinated by her.  Our paths crossed when I was a student at the  University of Missouri in Columbia in 1962.  I still have the lovely note she sent to my dorm to thank me for an editorial I wrote about her coming home in the Columbia Missourian.  She was Columbia's favorite girl, that's for sure.  The film remains glorious in his production numbers, costuming and often surprisingly sophisticated script and Hayward is the true miracle quotient.",1209081600,,1267,4.657657657657658

It's a little corny in places - even by the standards of movie musicals - but the actors carry the day and the great standards sung by Jane Froman (dubbing Susan Hayward) are expertly handled by the great Alfred Newman, who received an Oscar for scoring of a musical picture. I have no idea how close the screen story is to Froman's real life, but it doesn't matter.

2927909,5,B000UZDO3K,"Susan Hayward's performance as Jane Froman is a triumph of dancing, lip-sync and Froman-mimicry by this actress, in top form, in one of the more faithful-to-facts biopics of the 1950's.  The video restoration leaves a bit to be desired in that the color registry is still off in a few long shots, resulting a somewhat muddy color palate.  These are quite noticeable when contrasted with the many close-ups of Ms. Hayward and others that are stunningly crisp, and could be mistaken as being enhanced for high definition viewing.  The 1940's songs are Ms. Froman's actual voice and are famous for that period.  Digital audio restoration is excellent, as has come to be expected in film-to-DVD clean-ups of this kind.  An impossibly youthful Robert Wagner makes two short, but  memorable appearances.  Thelma Ritter is a perfect foil to this film's somewhat saccharine 1950's sentiments!  Film buffs: Why have this DVD in your library?  `With A Song In My Heart' is possibly the only major studio motion picture to capture for film history the little-remarked-upon costume malfunction by this A-list actress--and keep it in the film!  The accident occurs during Ms. Hayward's waltz to the film's title song with her dance partner, Ernest Newton.  Unlike the now infamous 2004 Super Bowl costume malfunction by Janet Jackson, Ms. Hayward is clearly unconscious of her predicament.  Mr. Newton's gallant descending embrace shields Ms. Hayward from further exposure to camera (and crew).  The sequence could not be missed during rushes nor the film's final editing process, so one can only guess that the expense of reshooting such a dance sequence was impracticable.  On the other hand, what a surprise to audiences of that era--if they didn't blink.  I did, missing this terrific blooper for years.",1197504000,5,1794,5.137931034482759

However, I got to hear a lot of Jane Froman because it was her voice that we heard coming out of Susan Hayward's mouth.

However, the last major scene was of Miss Froman singing to GI's at a hospital (somewhere in Europe if I'm not mistaken).

The script is standard Hollywood biopic, but the music is absolutely terrific, from Rodgers & Hart's ""Blue Moon"" to an elaborate production number of the title song to a rousing medley of patriotic and state songs.  A new biography of Froman, ""Say It With Music: The Life & Legacy of Jane Froman,"" fills in the gaps the movie doesn't cover and traces Froman's life from her return to performing in the States to her TV show of the 1950's to her years of retirement in Columbia, Missouri.

Seuling was both a fan and a friend of this great singer, and therefore is able to give her story a truly personal touch.

Many fine reviews have already preceded mine (considering it is not yet available) so I will not rehash the plot but give what I hope will be interesting insights into the making of this fine film.

Susan during her contract with FOX were her most visible superstardom years and it has always struck me a bit odd little has been released by the studio considering a quarter of their budget was wrapped up in her movies alone. She was the only star at Grauman's to place her hands, footprints and signature in cement embedded in gold dust. Hayward's famous long red tresses were insured for a million dollars and could only be trimmed a half inch. She was allowed to have it cut shoulder length since she bore some resemblence to Jane Froman. She spent hours in the recording booth watching Froman sing the songs used on the soundtrack, noting her every gesture and movement which explains why her lip syncing job is one of the best on celluloid. Her lavish wardrobe was not for glamor but character, as Froman was voted consistently one of the top 10 best dressed women of her time. Her elaborate dance routines took weeks of rehearsal and during one shot, her breast was flashed during a daily rush and and had to be reshot. A young Bob Wagner credits his success to Hayward for taking him under her wing. This was his first major film albeit a small part and he had to cry in one scene while Hayward was singing which he found difficult to execute. Hayward deliberately had the camers focused on the back of her head during the scene as she prompted him to tears. In the 70's he remarked on THE TONIGHT SHOW what a tremendous help she was to a young struggling actor. Susan was not one for making friends with her peers; however, the ascerbic Thelma Ritter as her nurse and companion became life-long friends. Ritter who was also nominated for an oscar should have won. She was overlooked by the Academy 6 times and never received an award of any type. Poor judgement indeed.

Susan made many top money making films for Fox and was always voted one of the top 10 most popular movies during her tenure with FOX yet few have been released and this is her only Oscar nod during her contract with the company. She was cast in big budget movies and given interesting scenes to appeal to her creative talents and despite the overblown budgets, she always managed to bring a close intimacy to the moviegoing public. The next year after SONG she was given her best and most overlooked role as the maligned Rachel Jackeson in THE PRESIDENT'S LADY co-starring a fairly junior Charleton Heston. He was one of her better male leads as their chemistry on screen crackled with electricity.

This grand scale musical was the biggest moneymaker in it's category for 1952 and she was voted the ""Most Popular Female Star of 1952"" and won a Golden Globe award. Here it is...and it's a long time coming. This one woman show leans towards sentimentality at times, but Hayward never allows it to become maudlin. Under her cabable hands she has managed to give one of the finest musical performances in film history.

This is a classic movie for everyone in the family to enjoy. Sit back and watch a real pro at work here. She is that rare combination of beauty and talent that is seldom found in Hollywood.

A one of a kind movie with a one of a kind actress--the great Susan Hayward. And it is tragic she died at the age of 56 just as she was returning to movies and having great success in important made for TV movies (at a time when this medium was usually silly fare).

I was around 10 years old when my older sister took me to see this movie. I fell in love with Susan after this.  The movie itself if one of the best musical's of all time. In 1952 at the Academy Awards, Susan was up for Best Actress including four other nominations including Best Musical Score which was won by Alfred Newman. The film even beat out ""Singing in the Rain"" that year.  Susan and the wonderful Jane Froman worked closely together on the set and Susan herself took dancing lessons.  The wardrobe for the movie was very expensive
Susan wore forty-two different outfits all designed by costume designer Charles Le Maire for which he was nominated.  Susan's wardrobe had to uphold Froman's tradition as one of the ""Ten Best Dressed Women in America""  Susan was considered as 20th Century Fox top female performer of her time and a huge asset to the studio.  When you see this film, you will know why!!",1189209600,7,1048,4.478947368421053
