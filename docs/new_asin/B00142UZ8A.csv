8254114,2,B00142UZ8A,"Was disappointed in this boxed set in that with the history of Fenway Park, so much was omitted!  I expected it to be highlights, not entire, complete games!  It did not include anything with the old-timers such as Ted Williams, Jim Rice, Carl Yazstremski, etc.  Too little content for too much money.  Save your $$$$.",1275868800,,318,4.7272727272727275
8254115,4,B00142UZ8A,"Here is a disk set that captures some of the greatest games from the ""Pahk"" meant for Red Sox Nation or any big fan of baseball. The games are complete coverege, so one gets to see what happened in the first almost dozen innings BEFORE Fisk's magical ""Stay Fair, Stay Fair"" walk off.  One disc meets the criteria because of how Martinez pitched in the '99 All Star, but after the first few innings there are many other contemporary heroes to watch.
By far...for the Nation....the single reason to buy this set is for the Bonus features. Seeing the footage of #9, then his appearance at the All Star Game in 1999 at Fenway. Enjoy more clips from our heroes like Yaz in '67 thru ""The Greatest Comeback in the History of Sports"". Grab some peanuts, Cracker Jacks & dust off the New Era cap and revel in the magical moments of Baseball's most historical field & team!",1246320000,,863,4.462025316455696
8254116,5,B00142UZ8A,"I had to counter the negative reviews with the fact that, although many think they were poor selections, FAN VOTING ALONE chose the games.  I voted, did you?  Not all the games I picked made it on the DVD but I don't think it deserves a negative review for that reason.

The ballot had something like 60 games to choose from, but broken up into decades, and you had to pick one from each section.  One from the 60's, one from the 70's, etc.

A good DVD package for the price, something an average fan should enjoy.  As you can see in other reviews, a die-hard fan might not enjoy it.  But a real die-hard fan should have voted. ;-)",1229040000,,631,4.208333333333333
8254117,3,B00142UZ8A,"How could MLB screw this collection up so badly?  Didn't they think that the 1967 games was already included on the NESN video honoring the Impossible Dream?  What about one of the World Series games or another game from the pennant race of that year?

The 1975 Game 6 is a must - even if it is in the 1975 WS Box Set.

What about Yaz's final game at Fenway?  Or, the game where Reggie Jackson got yanked and humiliated on national tv in 1977.

As much as I hated the result, the 1978 playoff game with the Yankees was one of the most dramatic games in history.  so what if we lost, what a game!

What about the 1986 ALCS clincher - Game #7?

Sorry, but the four homer game last season was interesting, but far from dramatic.

How could they not include the A-Rod \fight/Mueller walk-off game from 2004?  That was a classic?

1975 ALCS vs. A's?
The Clemens 20K game is a good one.

The 1999 PEdro game was great - PEdro at his best.  I'd pay for that one.

I just think they could have found some better games for this set.",1220313600,2,1023,4.1479591836734695
8254118,3,B00142UZ8A,"As a Sox fan and an old baseball game junkie - I have about 30 dvds with old games on them, I figured it would be hard for me not to want this.  BUT the game selection is uninspiring.  I already have 2 of them (75 WS GM 6 & the game from 1967).

Why would they include the entire game from 2007 with the 4 homeruns in a row when that WAS the hi-lite of the game while only showing Bill Mueller's walk off HR from the game on 7/24/04?  The 7/24/04 game with the A-Rod brawl and the great Red Sox comeback is the one that should be shown in its entirety - it is pretty much my favorite regular season game I've ever watched.

The only one I'd really pay to see again is Pedro in the '99 ALCS - so I may try to pick this up on the cheap on Ebay some day.",1212192000,16,751,3.7278481012658227
8254119,3,B00142UZ8A,Mlb certainly missed the boat on this collection.  As two of the games on this set have already been released on other sets with the 1967 game on the impossible dream dvd and the game six on the 1975 World Series DVD.  Their were certainly better choices overs the years for MLB to pick from that would've enhanced the experience for a Red Sox fan.  Examples of this are The june 1977 Yankee game featuring Billy Martin pulling Reggie Jackson from the game and the altercation that soon followed.  I understand why they wouldnt want to put the playoff on their from 1978.  Another example of a game they could've put on their was the Derek Lowe no hitter or the Clay Buchholz no hitter from last year.  Or for that matter any game except the 2004 ALCS featuring David Ortiz driving in a game winning run in their last at bat.,1209859200,7,825,4.394736842105263
8254120,4,B00142UZ8A,"Since the picture on the box was too small for me to read and the product description didn't tell me anything I wanted to know, I contacted A&E to find out which games are included in this collection. Here is their response:

DISC 1: Sept. 30, 1967 Regular Season vs Minnesota Twins--Carl Yastrzemski hit his 44th home run as the Sox tied for the lead in a four-team American League pennant race.

DISC 2: 1975 World Series Game 6 vs the Cincinnati Reds--This see-saw battle of the Titans ended with Carlton Fisk and his 12th inning game-ending home run.

DISC 3: Apr. 29, 1986 Regular Season vs Seattle Mariners--23-year-old Roger Clemens set the Major League record with 20 strikeouts in this hallmark game.

DISC 4: 1999 Major League Baseball All-Star Game and MLB All-Century Team celebration--Fenway Park was selected to house the final Mid-Summer Classic of the 20th Century and the festivities riveted the world.

DISC 5: 1999 American League Championship Series Game 3 vs New York Yankees--Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez shutdown the vaunted Yankees and former Boston pitcher Roger Clemens with 12 strikeouts over 7 innings.

DISC 6: Apr. 22, 2007 Regular Season vs New York Yankees--Boston dispensed with its archrival Yankees in large part thanks to four consecutive home runs.
