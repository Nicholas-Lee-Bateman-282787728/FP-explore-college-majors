8557918,5,B00AUF1BP8,"All I can say about this DVD is ""WOW"". It is one of the best DVD's on the market I have ever seen. The scenery, the wild life, and even the dirt runways and dirt strips. There is no actual airports, but there are little buildings they use for what I don't know.  The actual airport is Wilson Airport in Kenya.  All in all this is a fantastic DVD and well worth all the money that it cost. I would recommend this DVD for anyone who like the great outdoors and wild animals.  I give this DVD a 5 star rating.",1487030400,,506,3.99009900990099
