1621195,5,B00005LAET,"This video is so different than most ghost shows...and for that reason it is GREAT!! There are no silly ""ghost"" reenactments... but, instead, some absolutely incredible photos and VIDEO of spirits in their ""soul forms"" and ""ectoplasmic forms""...you can actually see spirits ""floating"" (I don't know how else to describe it!) by the camera...and you can tell they're not dust, flashlights, whatever else a skeptic may suspect. And because the director just lets you watch without ""slicking"" it up with fancy editing or graphics, you can actually watch the spirits in real time, as they were filmed.
And the ""sensitive"" featured on the show, Cathe Curtis, is utterly believable: down to earth, funny...how many ghost shows make you laugh? All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this show.
And I have to admit, the last segment, in the New Hope Cemetery, brought me to tears it was so absolutely beautiful and moving. You simply have to watch it to know what I mean. I cried like a baby...and I still tear up when I see watch it..but as Ms. Curtis says in the show, it was a ""happy cry.""",992822400,4,1077,4.73404255319149
1621196,2,B00005LAET,"New Hope isn't really the most haunted town in the US.  Frankly I've seen houses with more activity then every historical site in New Hope combined.  Don't get me wrong I love New Hope.  I grew up their (I still live near by), and I began my lifes work as a ghost hunter in New Hope.  The Logan Inn was the first haunted site I ever researched (for a school newspaper article), I've done the ghost tours bit, and been in a lot of the sites on this show.  The show though is badly done.  Its format is very flat and uninteresting.  Like far to many amateurs they obsess over orbs (which are hands down the least interesting and most easily explained of all ""psychic"" photography) and some of there other pictures are questionable as well.  I would suggest the books of the late Mary Adi Kent instead of this documentary.",1180483200,2,819,4.377483443708609
1621197,2,B00005LAET,"The premise of the documentary is very interesting, and many of the persons appearing in the film such as P.D. Cacek, and other residents of New Hope, lend credibility to the claims of paranormal events occuring at different inns or B&B's in the town, however it goes downhill after they bring in the ""sensitive?"" Cathe Curtis.  If she's psychic, I'm the Queen of England!  I give it 2 stars because I did enjoy the interviews with the ""normal"" residents of New Hope, and with the music used throughout the documentary, especially the closing track ""Her"" by Claire Voyant.  I'm really thankful I rented this DVD through my rental program, and didn't waste money buying it.  In other words.... it's not a keeper!",1175126400,,711,4.80327868852459
1621198,1,B00005LAET,"It's hard to add much to the reviews already posted below. This video is disappointing and totally unconvincing. The ""orbs"" which are meant to be spirits caught on film look suspiciously like something I've seen in several of my own photos, which I've since learned are caused by dust particles caught by the flash of the camera. In fact, I have several photos which have far more impressive orbs than any in this film, and I certainly don't attribute them to spirits.

I learned about this when I took a photograph in a barn and the resulting image came out with dozens and dozens of ""orbs."" This effect is most pronounced in dusty areas (basements and attics) but could occur in any room with even a small amount of airborne dust - not unusual I would think in these old manors. The end sequence is totally unconvincing with a steady light beam in the distance which looks completely ordinary and caused either by a flashlight or home light in the distance.

Another reviewer mentions the weirdness of the supposed-psychic's entreaties to the spirits, where she continually tells them, ""I love you."" No wonder there are no convincing photos of spirits in this film - if I were a spirit, I would stay far away from some strange human drifting from room to room whispering, ""I love you."" This is actually embarrassing and reminds me of the crazy guy in Grizzly Man who keeps telling the resident grizzly bears that he loves them - right up until the moment he's eaten by one. Really a waste of time and money. New Hope looks like a nice historic town to visit; it may well be haunted, but nothing in this video supports that even remotely.",1166918400,4,1639,4.590443686006826
1621199,2,B00005LAET,"This DVD is more of a home-grown documentary than the captivating evidence of paranormal entities I was hoping to see.  The people in the DVD are sweet and well-meaning, but that's not what I bought this for. If you're looking for a ghost ""sightings,"" voices or supernatural behavior, you won't find it here.  The final scene in which orbs are filmed outdoors is somewhat intiguing, but not enough so to recommend this item.",1165536000,3,424,4.794520547945205
1621200,1,B00005LAET,"I'm a firm believer in ghosts, but always remain a skeptic when not experiencing paranormal occurrences myself. Cathe claims to be a sensitive... highly doubt it. Anyone could have put on the performances that she put on. The orbs that were shown on the videos could very well have been flashlights in the forest. At one point, when the camera zoomed in on the orb, the shape of the orb was more visible and wasn't circular as it had formerly appeared to be, it was a perfect square (like those square shaped flashlights). And the fact that Cathe kept approaching every ""spirit"" like it was a little child was incredibly annoying. She would say, ""It's OK, come out. I love you, I love you. No one's going to hurt you."" I mean come on, if they were spirits, then they obviously used to be human and don't need to be baby talked like they've never been a part of the real world. All in all, not a convincing documentary and barely even entertaining. The only enjoyable parts were the interviews with people who actually lived in the haunted buildings being investigated. Cathe just seemed like an intruder and, unfortunately, she was in the majority of the video.",1148256000,12,1161,4.613526570048309
1621201,1,B00005LAET,"This movie flat out sucks! The orbs are the spirits... you hope you see apparitions from reading the description. BUT YOU DON'T! These people flat out ruin the work of serious ghost hunters. They use a cheap Sony Mavica 640x480 resolution digital camera. Everything you see is a dust orb or moisture orb. The actual videos are also of ""skeptical variety"". Don't waste your money UNLESS you want a good laugh!!!!!!!!! I cannot give this a fair rating because Amazon starts the ratings at 1 star. I give this a flat out ZERO STARS! I was thinking of making a sequel and dumping a used vacuum cleaner bag onto a floor in my house and showing how many GHOSTS I have in my home!!! Ha Ha Ha! Cathe Curtis, you are a joke! Fulton sucks as a spirit photographer!",1111708800,8,754,4.431654676258993
1621202,1,B00005LAET,"This DVD is horrible! I can't believe I am out $24 dollars for it. First they put this ugly woman on as the introduction. She's got a mole on her face the size of a tire. Then they have the nerve to have us believe that little white spots on people are ghosts. I have seen so many films on TV that showed us so much more, and was much more entertaining. I bought this DVD as an investment.  I like to share my movies with others. Please don't waste your money. bba",1108512000,11,464,3.989247311827957
1621203,1,B00005LAET,"After watching many ghost videos over the years I've seen many excellent and not not excellent videos, and this video falls in this category. This is more of a badly thrown together documentary, then a ghost hunt! The video is very ameteur and actually reminded me at times of the blair witch movie!!!The acting, yes acting is obvious and I find the lead character a close second to to being possessed herself, but not by the spirit world. If you love a good ghost hunt and scare this is not the movie for you and is a waste of money and better left on the shelf.",1108425600,7,563,4.320754716981132

1621205,1,B00005LAET,"Hands down, the worst ghost documentary. Nothing here but 'orbs' and badly told tales of hauntings by people with less than half a brain. Plus most of the orbs are obvious camera flares.
In short, nothing more here than an author filming locations in their hometown, which they abruptly claim is the scariest. PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS",1099267200,13,335,4.793103448275862
1621216,3,B00005LAET,"Overall I thought this video was pretty boring.  It's mainly just story telling and non of it are re-enacted.  At the end of the video they did have some of the best orb videos I have ever seen.  I've watched this video twice already.  The second time I watched it, I fast forwarded to the orb videos.

I think this video is worth seeing, but I don't think it's worth the price at all.",1094688000,4,385,4.148648648648648
1621217,1,B00005LAET,"When I saw another documentary, or docudrama, made for tv, called ""Saved By The Light,"" I found it very fascinating; ""The Peter Hurkos Story..."" now there was a real psychic; the story of ""The Rain Boy,"" featured on ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" there too was a remarkable account of a true ghost story! Every Monday I watch ""Weird Travels"" on The Travel Channel, and often the accounts showcased in many of the hour-long documentaries are just excellent and, for the most part, believable.  But Cathe Curtis' touchy feelie love affair with ectoplasm, if it is that, and her seemingly fictional ghostly ""beautiful people,"" made me want to cry real tears it was so ridiculous!

Everyone else in the film, the hotel owners; the theatre owner; the man who wrote ghost stories and who is a rather interesting person to listen to when he discusses the local lore, even the ghosts, whom you don't really see (I didn't see anything except a few ""orbs"") and they could have been light reflection or swamp gas for all I know? Really, all you do see are a few lights caught by the camera and a lot of insects and dust.  I saw something but I'm pretty sure it wasn't ghosts I saw, no matter what some of the other reviewers said they saw.

I believe strongly in the ""spirit world,"" and know when someone is really a ""sensitive,"" like Dannion Brinkley or Peter Hurkos or Rosemary Altea, a true medium. But this gal, Cathe Curtis with all of her ""I love you,""; ""Come here, come on! Come on everyone!"" nonsense made me just laugh.  That woman needs some counseling.

If you want a real ghost story buy the book, ""Grave's End: A True Ghost Story,"" by Elaine Mercado, R.N., Llewellyn Worldwide Publishers, at [...] a book which is the most amazing ghost story I have ever had the pleasure and wonder to experience in any form.  I pray one day someone will make an accurate film of that remarkable book!  Or buy the film, ""Grave Secrets: The Legacy Of Hilltop Drive,"" if you can find a copy of the DVD (Try Ebay).  It was based on the true story recounted in the book, ""The Black Hope Horror: The True Story Of A Haunting,"" by Ben and Jean Williams and John Bruce Shoemaker, William Morrow and Co., 1991. But whatever you do, unless you collect documentaries about hauntings and just have to have ""America's Most Haunted Town,"" consider purchasing the two books mentioned above, or at least the DVD, ""Grave Secrets,"" rather than spend $24.95 on this 59 minute visit to New Hope, which wouldn't be so bad if it were not for Cathe Curtis and all of her ""I love you"" touchy feelie ghost banter.

I would rather put some pebbles in my shoes for pennance and walk around in them for weeks on end, or knash my wrists with jagged stones rather than listen to Cathe Curtis talk to another ghost to whom she insists on professing her love. Do you remember Lucia Pamela's recording of ""Walking On The Moon""?  Well, Cathe Curtis, I'm sure, is her daughter:  ""Come on, come on, come on! Let's take a walk on the moon!""

One thing I really did like about this movie was the music.  Listen to the music and at the end of the film pause it to write down some of the names of the composers of the music used in this film (especially the music used in the segment on Pineapple Hill B&B, I think it was; the music alone is worth the purchase of this rather disappointing documentary,  or mockumentary.

To be fair to the neophite viewing this film, I understand how you could be conned into thinking this film is different and perhaps even good, explain sex to a six year old; and to the others, the novelist at the film's beginning, to the historian whom I could have easily listened to throughout the film, and to all of the hotel owners and tour guides, and the others who were obviously serious people, I have to say as long as any of them are telling us about this or that spirit, the film is just fine, but whenever Cathe Curtis appeared I wanted to murder her. I'd like also to murder the narrater at the film's introduction who tries so hard to sound like Rod Serling.

By the way, some spirits are not full of love; some were (probably) and remain truly scary ""people"" who like in the tv documentary, ""A Haunting In Georgia,"" would definitely hurt you.  Not all ghosts are so loving as Ms. Curtis says they are in ""America's Most Haunted Town,"" which if it is (the ""most haunted town""), would better be served by getting Elvira to walk us through the locations in New Hope than the very unremarkable and unconvincing sensitive Cathe Curtis. At least Elvira would have been believable.

The last scenes at New Hope Cemetery made me wish terribly that it would begin raining radioactive fallout and that the dead would rise up and eat her. The only thing worse than listening to Cathe Curtis talk to spirits is imagining another four years of George W. Bush. Now that is something to fear!",1092441600,11,4853,4.500568828213879
1621218,1,B00005LAET,"First of all, I adore ghost documentaries.  The most realistic the better.
Secondly, orbs are fascinating to look at -- the first one, two dozen times you see them.  After that, they're boring.
When I see ghost documentaries, I need to see more than orbs.  I need to see things moving by themselves, I need to hear sounds that are not being made by humans, I need to see figures through infrared cameras that aren't there when you take the camera away.  Orbs and protoplasms just don't cut it anymore.
But orbs are just what you get in this documentary.  That and a medium who ""feels"" the presence of spirits while she walks around a house.  That's it.
This may be impressive for a novice, but it's quite a yawnful for someone who's already has seen other ghost documentaries (or has had their own ghostly experiences).
Incidentally, I'm afraid I can't say that this town could, by *any* stretch of the imagination, be called the ""Most Haunted Town"".  By what standards?  By a 10-mile radius?  In the county?  What?  The name fools you already.
So it's up to you.  If you're a ghost ""virgin"", you may be impressed.  If you've been around the block already, move on.  You may be more impressed with ""Scariest Places on Earth"".  At least you can *pretend* that there's something going on there.",1066608000,28,1292,4.605263157894737
1621219,1,B00005LAET,"I had to laugh when I saw this video.  I work with a group that investigates haunted places, and I was so grateful that none of us act in this way.
None of the pictures captured anything that could  be explained as paranormal. The psychic was rude, and nothing could make me ever want to be involved with this group.
There are scores of better videos and shows on television.

After viewing this video, I was speechless. It does nothing but make a mockery of the Spirit realm. It is difficult enough to provide or find good, quality content without the constant downgrading of skeptics and nonbelievers, but if rediculous junk like this continues to hit the market, it will only provide more fuel for their fire. I can see why there are so many skeptics out there after watching this film.

I viewed the tape several times in hopes of at least catching a glimpse of something, but to my disappointment - nothing but a few orbs, which are easily produced by light reflection.
Ms. Curtis' approach to the spirit world is cutesy, but seems somewhat demeaning. ""Can we take your image? Aren't you precious."" Even my 8 year old daughter rolled her eyes at that.",1011916800,9,461,4.703703703703703

7943710,2,B00005LAET,"I used to live 15 away from New Hope and would go there every weekend. It's a beautiful historic area and does indeed have some interesting energy, however, this documentary doesn't do the history of the place any justice. I would take a trip to the area if you can and take the guided walking tour instead. Do I believe that there are spirits in this town? Yes. But I also believe that what was caught on this video and labeled as spirt sightings was evidence of dust and bugs lit up by the camera flash. The ghost whisperer in this video also came off as a bit of a quack. Don't let this video turn you off from New Hope. It's a wonderful area with a lot of fascinating history to explore.

7943714,1,B00005LAET,"This video is rather boring and dull. After seeing the blurb at the beginning that none of the photos or film shown had been edited or tampered in any way, I was expecting cool EVP's (they did not try that once in this film, very strange to me), some scary video shots and possible photos of apparitions.

Instead it turned out to be mainly what people living there had heard from Cousin Abe or Auntie Abigail. I ignored their boasting as the most haunted town in the USA or World, so many other towns and cities have said the same exact thing. I don't think there is a most haunted town or city in the US and abroad. Every haunted town has some spooky areas but no one has the most, that is silly.

I am sure the film video -tographer worked hard on this film, spent many hours taking film, editing, finding proper music for the different sequences and so on. He is the one I feel sorry for.

The psychic on there seemed fake or rather was a good actor, she didn't say anything or guess any stories that could be validated. I could have done the same thing. I really dislike people who don't have psychic or medium ability and then pass themselves off as having those gifts. The ones that ask for money and aren't honest really burn me up the most. I hope this woman offered her ""psychic services"" for free.

Everything, just about that they took photos of, was an orb except I think there was an unexplained headshot of someone in one photo. All the orb photos had the same exact shape and look to them. I only saw maybe one real spirit:energy orb in the entire photo and it was in a film they took in one of the bedrooms.

The long viewing orb at the end in the cemetery was impressive if there wasn't someone in the woods with a good flashlight. All in all if people want to make these films for their own personal experience or to share with friends, I have no problem with it. But to collect money for it by selling it on line is not honest. And not only did this couple cast doubt and a bad reputation on themselves, they also did it to the people of the town and the video guy who is trying to probably make a living and a reputation in his field.

It's only an hour long but for the first 50 minutes all you get are commentaries by people in the town and a visting psychic telling every ""spirit"" she encounters ""I love you"". When you finally do see something it's in the shape of orbs. Orbs mean very little to me. I can produce orbs by sitting outside on a summer's evening and filming bugs flying around. There were shots of paintings around the various inns in  town which supposedly  show spirits
