7968357,5,B00006G9VJ,"Beautifully written, wonderfully produced, tongue-in-cheek documentary shows. The sort of thing BBC America used to show before it thoroughly corporatized. I only wish all of the episodes were available.",1215820800,2,203,6.0344827586206895
7968358,5,B00006G9VJ,"If you enjoy a good mockumentary, I warmly recommend People Like Us. It is hilarious, perhaps second only to Spinal Tap itself.

One of the brilliant things is the narration. On the surface it sounds just like the typical BBC narration, but if you really listen to it, it is chock-full of the most hilarious manglings of the language.

I hope they bring out Series Two soon.",1210723200,2,374,4.567164179104478
7968359,5,B00006G9VJ,"Back when BBC America was programmed well they showed most of the People Like Us series. The show follows the daily routines of different jobs like photographers, police, and even real estate brokers. The commentary from the host filming is very dry wit at times and very funny, much like the random comments of David Brent. If you liked The Office UK, this is a must see.",1168387200,7,372,4.567164179104478
