4014956,2,B002ZCY85E,"I still love, love love this show but I didn't like the girl they were hired to save. I don't like people who think that someone owes them something. Her whole reason for living was to be her father's alter ego but after that what's left. Don't save people like that because they are not likeable and they only bring down the show. But, I forgive you. Now lets move on to bigger and better things.",1266192000,,397,4.2368421052631575
4014957,1,B002ZCY85E,This show should be on USA network with things like Burn Notice. The acting is bad and the action is over-the-top. The characters are flat and there is no sign that the writing will ever add life to them. If you like brainless paper thin plots with no central story you might like this show. I honestly don't see it lasting more than a season.,1264118400,,343,4.292307692307692
4014958,4,B002ZCY85E,"This show seems to be off to a great start.  It has the right mix of comedy and action which makes for a great way to spend an hour.

4015189,5,B002ZCY85E,"Very excellent program.  Superb casting, acting and stories.  As I mentioned in my review of the program, 'The Unit', if I like a show too much it seems that it doesn't last too long. Human Target lasted 2 seasons.  In the second season we see the addition of two new cast members, women, who add a lot to the overall cast.  That said, Season 1 (and Season 2) are excellent, with lots of action, and great character interaction.  It's very well produced, with great cinematography, including scenes of San Francisco that are pretty well done.  Still, the casting and the overall stories are what makes this show superb.  You have to love Guerrero...Coolest bad/good guy in the history of television.",1458172800,6,699,4.775

4015264,4,B002ZCY85E,"FOX has become notorious for cancelling great shows before they'd even gotten started. To them, if the show isn't in the top 50 after it's initial 13 episode run, it isn't worth their time or money. As a result, some of the most imaginative and intense shows to come along in years are cancelled before they've even gotten started. Human Target is on a list that includes, Alcatraz, The Chicago Code, Gracepoint, Almost Human, Dollhouse, and dozens of others that you've probably never heard of. Unless it's a top 50 show right from the start, or a lame animated comedy, Fox has no use for it and shows like Human Target are replaced with Bob's Burgers and The Cleveland Show.

For those unfamiliar with the story, Human Target is based on a long running DC comic by the same title. It is the story of Christopher Chance (Mark Valley), a mysterious man with a mysterious past. Joined by a former police detective, and a hacker/thug named Guerrero, Chance has formed a company that discreetly serves an elite clientele. Their job is to protect their clients from threats at any cost, by injecting themselves into the persons life. Chance's job is to identify the threat and eliminate it before anything happens to the client.

I don't know how Mark Valley is not a household name at this point. This guy is so intense, always has tremedous, unorthodox ways of getting out of trouble, and to be honest, he really reminds me of MacGyver. Valley has the looks, the charm, and of course the skills to make Christopher Chance jump off the pages and come to life.

But this show isn't just an episonic show, there is also a deep and complex back story that gets more intense with each episode. We know the players and what they are capable of very quickly in the series, but what we don't know is their history. As more and more is revealed, the characters just get deeper and more intense.

Human Target was a great show, it was original, exciting, and better than almost anything on FOX at the present time. Mark Valley is very impressive, as is the writing. Every episode has at least one thing in it that you did not see coming, and if it were up to me, this show would have been on for years. Thanks for exciting me, getting my hopes up, and disappointing me once again FOX!",1433289600,,2272,4.534146341463415
4015265,5,B002ZCY85E,"Mark Valley is a tremendously talented actor and does some really incredible physical scenes.  The stunts and special effects are absolutely top notch and unheard of for a TV show.  The writing and character development is strong, the actors are perfectly chosen both in the supporting cast (McBride, Haley) and guest stars like Lennie James (a personal favorite) and Emmanuelle Vaugier.  The topping on the sundae is the music, Bear McCreary has become a personal favorite of mine.  It makes the story even better.  I honestly thought it was one of the most well done shows in every aspect I've seen on TV aside from LOST.",1431734400,,623,4.839622641509434

The addition of Janet Montgomery's character was not needed and that, to me, was the downfall of the show.  I would love to buy the DVD of season 2 and hope that it is produced sometime in the future.  From the reviews I've seen , I would think they would make money on its distribution.",1414108800,,460,4.3023255813953485
4015327,4,B002ZCY85E,"After about 6 episodes I got tired of the same mini-TV series ""James Bond"" type show with the same characters acting the same way over and over again.  I was not sure what the ""Black dude"" is supposed to be or how he fits in.  He seems to be the ""office manager,"" with attitude.  Maybe ""James Bond"" type of guys have to be in full length movies with a lot of special effects and all the songs and music that goes with each one.

But if your family wants to watch a James Bond type TV series without the prerequisite sex scenes with every beautiful woman James meets who can't resist no matter who they are, the standard gambling scene, dry martini environment, without the Amazon/BBC prerequisite homosexual scene, without some other political agenda scenes like global warming destroying the world, etc. and without the standard swearing and cursing scenes, then this could be a good source of this type of entertainment for the family.",1413417600,,937,4.66060606060606

4015397,5,B002ZCY85E,I can express my disappointment that this television series ended so suddenly. My wife and I were dedicated fans of this shows for several reasons. The action was on the level with the best action movies at that time. I also greatly enjoyed the interaction between the central characters during season one. My wife greatly enjoyed the twist which took place in the storyline during season two but I suspect those twist were part of the reason for it's down fall. There are elements of the television version of Mission Impossible and Leverage throughout the episodes of Human Target. Since I enjoyed both of those series I also greatly enjoyed Human Target.,1404518400,,657,4.875

It was so easy to like the characters (even some of the more nefarious ones) but the story line got a little peculiar after season one and may be why the series was dropped.

4015453,5,B002ZCY85E,Season One is incredible - the best - lots of action and the characters are believable and very well written - the female guest stars are very well cast - the music is by Bear McCreary and adds to the heroic atmosphere - the main character is truly the hero type with a great sense of humor - could have been a better James Bond than some who ran with the part - I haven't seen season two because someone lacking marbles has placed the second season on an online viewing model only - will not go there - but I can say season one is the best !,1399420800,,542,3.981651376146789
4015454,5,B002ZCY85E,I love this show! Was very sad to find out it was only 2 seasons and was canceled in 2012. The cast is awesome! It is wonderful to see a show that deals with storylines especially and not just filler.......just waiting for season. 2!,1398729600,,233,4.318181818181818

4015545,5,B002ZCY85E,"This first season was excellent. Very entertaining, but suffered from constant scheduling changes.  Enjoy this, but don't waste your time on season 2 as the added characters and change in direction removed the uniqueness that made the show so good. It became another predictable, cookie-cutter show. No wonder it was cancelled.",1392163200,2,327,5.411764705882353
4015546,5,B002ZCY85E,This is a remake of a show on abc in 1992 starring Rick Springfield it was only 7 episodes. Luckily they got Mark Valley to play Christopher Chance for this installment and Jackie Earle Haley as. Guerrero (he is in the new Robocop movie). This series is about a bodyguard who puts himself in harms way to protect clients. There is lots of action and the stunt work is awesome. It is a really good first season and for some reason in the second season they changed the formatting of the show and added more characters that seemed to muddy the waters quite a bit. This season 1 blu-ray is great it is in full hd which rocks and I tell you having a blu-ray is way better then a digital version it just looks so much nicer on your tv then digital versions. I do wish they would give you a digital copy for when you are on the road as other blu-rays do but I can live without it. Buy this blu-ray and you will not be disappointed.,1392163200,,925,4.144444444444445

4015583,5,B002ZCY85E,"This is a fantastic series that sadly got cancelled midway in Season 2. The sarcastic humor and the way the characters become more real as the season progresses is fantastic! I would recommend this show to anyone who enjoys humor, action, and a little bit of romance. The main character is just great and you will grow to love him!",1389052800,,331,4.533333333333333
4015584,5,B002ZCY85E,"Human Target only lasted two seasons because it was too expensive to cast, crew and film, but the quality of each episode is far superior to most all episodes of any miniseries produced today.  The dramatic and humorous interaction between the cast members is astounding.  It would be hard pressed, if not impossible, to find a better combination of Chi McBride, Mark Valley and Jackie Earle Haley.  My family is looking forward to Human Target season two, with the addition of Janet Montgomery and Indira Varma.

We can only hope that Human Target will find its way to the big screen, or Fox will again produce Seasons 3 and 4 with the same cast.",1389052800,,647,4.649122807017544

4015586,5,B002ZCY85E,"I was a little skeptical of this series at first.  I wasn't sure what to expect since I was not familiar with the ""Christopher Chance"" character from Action Comics (later known as DC Comics.)  I felt the producers had set the bar pretty high in comparing him to James Bond, however, I was very pleasantly surprised when the show lived up to this, in more ways than one.

If I were to describe this series in one sentence, it would be, ""This is James Bond with heart.""  Not saying that James Bond did not have a heart, but his moniker ""007: License to kill,"" suggests that he will do whatever he needs to to get the job done.  Christopher Chance shows a lot of restraint, given what is previous profession was.

I am currently waiting for season 2 to be released, and I hope it is soon.",1386547200,,785,4.3061224489795915

4015588,3,B002ZCY85E,"Its a good show.  Alot of action and some fun one-liners.  The biggest drag is that Chris Chance is just too perfect and it doesn't seem like he is trying too hard.  Its a fun, campy show.",1382832000,,188,4.027027027027027

4015590,5,B002ZCY85E,So after the second season this show just kind of got cut off and we haven't heard anything about it for 2 years. Which is sad because this show is so amazing! I loved every minute of the first season and blew straight through the second season as well. The only down side is that this season will get you so into it that you will almost have a soul crushing moment when you realize you don't have anymore of it to watch.,1380153600,,421,4.0843373493975905
4015591,5,B002ZCY85E,"I for one, truly loved this series when it was on.  From the nuanced characters to the great action scenes, to the interesting plot lines--this show had intelligent writing.  The plots unfolded all over the world, from jungles to embassies and back.  The interaction between the lead characters was thoroughly engaging.  Yes, this series was too intelligent to last.  It only made 2 seasons.  What do we get instead?  Hillbilly Handfishin' and Keeping up With the Kardashians et al stay on the air!?!?  I must weep in frustration.  Can't find season 2 yet, but I will snap it up when it surfaces!  If you like intelligent action stories, this is for you!  If you like crap like the above mentioned, you are part of the problem!

4015670,5,B002ZCY85E,"Season one of Human Target is nearly a perfect intro to a great show. In this season, the lead character, Christopher Chance, takes on other identities to get the job done. Each identity demands specific skills, one even required him to be fluent in Japanese. The show also prides itself on fresh action sequences and inventive fight scenes, such as a big brawl in the upper duct of an airplane. Imagine trying to throw some hay-makers in a 3 foot crawl space. Very fun stuff. Plus, you get some sweet cameos, including the oh so cool, Lee Majors.

Season 2 completely changed this fresh format to just the main character doing rescue missions with very little ""assuming someone's identity"" to achieve his goal, so for me, season to is a pass!

The real winner for season one is the dynamic between the three main characters. Three dudes who all see things a little differently, but still have respect for one another, often to help save each other's skin. If you've never seen this show, pick up season one and treat yourself. If you're already a fan, then what are you waiting for. Season one on blu ray...with bonus features...can't go wrong. There's a great documentary on what it was like trying to make ""a full on action movie"" each week on a tight budget.

The lead actor, Mark Valley, is terrific. This show really fits his personality. He tends to get on all these legal dramas, so I was really hoping to see this show last 5 or 6 seasons, but for some reason, the ratings just weren't there. It had a very similar vibe to USA Network's ""Burn Notice"" which is still going strong. Perhaps they should have moved ""Human Target"" to USA...where GOOD characters are welcome :-)",1368144000,,1681,4.615384615384615

Jackie Earle Haley (a favorite of mine since ""Watchmen"") is the real standout here. His Guerrero is deceptivley dangerous, a total smartass, and intriquingly loyal to Chance (Mark Valley). Through all the episodes he was my absolute favorite. Chi McBride does a good job as a put upon office manager and good friend of Chance.

4015892,5,B002ZCY85E,"Inspired by a DC Comics called Human Target, Jonathan A Steinberg offers us a variation of this series. In his show, Christopher Chance's job is to protect his clients from any threats (direct or indirect) not by taking the identity of his clients, but instead by using a fake identity which will allow him to immerse in his client's life. Along with his colleagues, which consist of Winston, an ex-detective, and Guerrero, a hacker-hit-man from Chance's past, each episode involves a different client and a new identity to adopt during the course of this twelve episodes season. Although some people complained about such a short season format when they would have preferred sixteen or twenty three episodes, the chosen length  didn't bother me at all. As long as the scripts and visual effects were in great quality, I didn't mind watching a short season action show.

The only things that did annoy me however were the times I managed to glimpse Canada Post truck and letterboxes in episodes that were happening in San Francisco or in New York. Not only that, at the beginning of the fourth episode, there is also a helicopter shot of that french-Canadian monastery, and by judging the architecture of the building and the mountains, that shot seemed to have been done not in Canada, but in a Californian location. So that simple detail reminded to me that this episode hadn't been shot in that province, and it broke the illusion of the episode. Apart from that, I am amazed how the Vancouver visual artists did a good job in their computer graphic effects, especially in the second episode with that airplane and in the sixth episode with that skydiving introduction. As for the orchestral soundtrack, it is excellent and makes the opening credits, and Chance's missions, epic and unforgettable.

Meanwhile, the scripts' plot lines and dialogues were well written and had enough suspense to keep you in your seat and make you wonder how Chance and his colleagues would get out of their mess. I also appreciated the interactions between the three main characters  and I can say that of all the three characters, my favorite is Guerrero. His character is so unpredictable that you are never too sure what he will do if you provoke him. Kudos to Haley's performance which allowed the character to not be a pilot appearance, but an essential character for the series. His interactions with Winston were funny and uplifted the mood of the show. Of the twelve episodes, my favorites would be the second, the eight episode, and the finale. Which concludes in the opening of the second season.

In the end, this show really stands as proof that you can do action shows with both high production values and excellent scripts.",1332547200,,2721,4.855603448275862

4015896,5,B002ZCY85E,"i have been a fan of this character for some time now--my original exposure was the original tv series from the early 90's which featured rick springfield as the titular hero, a man who could be anyone. from there, i discovered his origins in comic books, which opened up a wealth of history for a often under-utilized character. of course, this has since changed beginning in the mid-2000's when peter milligan & edvin biukovic collaborated on a human target limited series comic which began exploring the greater psychology self inherent in a man who can at will take on the affectations of another human being--so much so that he can literally become the other person. pretty heady stuff to explore. & done masterfully well within those later comics written by milligan.

this television series is amazingly well done, too--it has taken all of the best elements of the rick springfield version (which deserves a dvd release itself--warner bros., pay attention!) & deftly added more of the psychological elements found in the funnybooks & film quality stunts. however, instead of our hero being someone who can be anyone by becoming the person whose life is in danger he is more like a bodyguard for hire, meant to stand between that person & the assassin. i was a bit reticent with this concept at first but my concerns were unfounded....season 1 starts off with a bang! there is action aplenty as we are introduced to the primaries & their histories. the actors do particularly well here; each crafting their own unique character that integrates into the whole seemlessly--the chemistry among them is wonderful. it's interesting watching the relationships develop to the point that you can see the obvious trust that the characters have developed through the backstory being told...i liked the idea that christopher chance himself is on the run from both emotional/pychological events in his past, as well as being on the run from his former employer--who wants him back--there are also obvious homages to past tv shows like marker (richard grieco) & vengeance unlimited (michael madsen) where the hero saves someone & all he asks in return is assistance on future cases; it works really well on this show, as it did on those others--i heartily recommend checking all of the above out (if you haven't already!). this show is definitely ""the quality merchandise;"" i was saddened to hear of its cancellation, especially since it was one of the best shows on the ""boob tube"" at the time (i suspect this had more to do with commercial placement than actual viewership--) but am heartened by the eventual release of season 2 on dvd!!",1327795200,,2632,4.941309255079007

Sure you have to overlook some plot and action impossibilities but my gawd I have no idea how they come up with so many situations I first found impossible to get out of. The second season introduces new characters that break up the boys club but they were probably necessary to broaden the potential viewership of a show as brutal as it was exciting. If the numbers were low I can't say Fox had to renew it but what a shame.

I still wish FOX would have had a brain and a heart with the public, instead of s dollar sign in their hearts.

This show combines action and adventure as I said before. It is different from the DC comic book series of the same name, in that one- Christopher Chance assumes the identity of the person or someone close to the person (sort of like Rollin hand from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mission-Impossible-Complete-Series/dp/B002L9N4N8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mission: Impossible - Complete Series</a>. This version, Chance is a protector of clients. More like a security expert with a sense of adventure thrown in.

The amazing support cast including Chi McBride and Jackie Earle Haley is pared well with Mark Valley's Chance.  It works because dynamic tension of the cast is built into the storyline.

The intelligent dialog is compare to a dozen action films with great story lines that make you keep watching. The mystery of who is trying to kill the client  has a lot of twists and turns that you never quite expect from a TV show

I caught bits and pieces of the show and didn't see anything I DIDNT like, but it appeared, on the surface, to be a well-shot, but typically formulamatic action show with an ensemble cast.  Color me wrong.

12 episodes later, this fleshed-out, character-driven action/drama/comedy is one of the best things I've seen on TV, in this genre, in a long, long time. Its almost flawless: ""real"" action (not a lot of CGI banter, but fast-paced martial-arts style sparring), good character development, case-of-the-week AND seasonal-arc drama, a developing ""buy-in"" on the show that only takes a few episodes to foster, people getting shot without spraying blood as the centerpiece (a good balance, I might add), depth to the players (Guerrera's character, to me most of all exemplifies this show, as you get the immediate nerdy surface traits but quickly find out he's much darker, dangerous, and sinister than you'd have ever imagined) and solid writing and supporting actors (did everyone from Battlestar Galactica stop by for a guest appearance?)

I was floored, and this may become part of the personal DVD collection soon, as I think the replay value on these episodes may be high. It is just a well-done series, and if you approached it with some trepidation like I did initially, fear not, its worth your time and attention.",1301356800,,1396,5.004310344827586

4015978,4,B002ZCY85E,"I came across Human Target by chance when I saw one of the episodes from the 2nd series on TV in a hotel in Boston earlier this year.  I was of course pleased to see the always gorgeous, and pretty talented, Indira Varma given the chance of decent airtime in a show where (I think!) she does not get killed prematurely.  (Rome - Torchwood - Luther - what is going on!?).  Note, she is not in this 1st series, but a variety of other similarly lesser-known actresses, all with non-cliched but indubitable good looks, and acting chops above their fame level, are ... not the least pleasure of the programme.

Other pleasures include relatively innovative plots and scripts (though lots of use of flashbacks and back stories), the well-mannered yet dangerous hero, strong ensemble playing, and a light-handed reliance on humour for most of the sexual chemistry.  The regular male cast members also have excellent male-bonding chemistry, with the theme of ""decent and essentially honest tough guys"" well exploited.

All in all, yes, a bit different, and skilfully done.  I must look into the ?comic book? origins of this series, I can't wait for the Varma-fest of Series 2 on Blu-ray, and I hope it gets (and believe it deserves) at least a 3rd outing.

The Blu-ray is great, and definitely better than a DVD as the production, being modern, was almost certainly shot in HD video.  The explosions and shooting and plane crashes etc. are lavishly enough staged to benefit from all this.",1297900800,,1480,4.7952755905511815

The new cast is good, but their having funds for all their capers take out some of the fun, and variety in missions they take on. Nevertheless, I truly like this show.

All the characters blend together despite their varying personalities to provide a great hour of entertainment. I was wondering how the relationship between Chance and Pucci would play out? Would the producers keep it on the level of a Matt Dillion - Miss Kitty relationship or expose their affection for each other? I guess the last two episodes explained that.

Mark Valley is a plank of oak (he was much funnier in ""Boston Legal."").  However, he gets great support from Chi McBride and Jackie Earl Haley.

And guest stars like Lennie James and Armand Assante add juice; even Lee Majors (""The Fall Guy"") shows up as a retired body guard (Yes, we get it.): the previous Christopher Chance.

4016028,5,B002ZCY85E,"Fox was always way ahead of the major networks in the action genre department as the seasons of '24' can attest to.  Now we have 'HUMAN TARGET', a high octaine well acted series which will also appeal to non action viewers.  Mark Valley owns the series and finally, he gets to show off his under appreciated acting talents as he molds  the character of Christopher Chance into a complex, honorable hero.  Valley failed to click with audiences in the underrated British set series 'KEEN EDDIE' and was the memorable boyfriend lover of character Olivia Dunham in Fox's other hit 'FRINGE' and its fitting that both Valley and Anna Torv are married in real life.  Chi Mcbride ,who I always thought never got a great role since his stint as the principal in the great series 'BOSTON PUBLIC' is Chance's assistant and plays it tongue in cheek as a detective who got the dirty end of the stick and now devotes his life to Chance after witnessing the tragic murder of his wife.  And last but not least the excellent, lethal character of Guerraro played eccentrically by Jackie Earle Hailey and who I feel stole the film 'WATCHMEN' from everybody else , is linked to Chance in more ways than one.  The series is produced, written and directed by the best action people in the business and I defy anyone who sees the 'PILOT' episode directed by Simon West not to think it could rank among the best theatrical action films.  I missed quite a bit of the episodes on this first run so it was a joy to watch them uninterrupted.  The new season has the introduction of two female leads in the mix and for what I have seen, the series has not lost its impetus.  Sadly, there are rumors that 'HUMAN TARGET' may have a cult audience but not enough for it to return for a third season which would be a tragedy. Warner Home video includes excellent featurettes on the making of the series and includes interviews with its main actors. The episodes are presented in widescreen Dolby Digital sound for an excellent aural experience.

in a world of Crime dramas Courtroom dramas or Medical dramas, the fourth would be a lone man/woman coming in and doing that favor that saves a life and then disapears before they learn the real name of the person. can't even do a finger print search on them as the FBI database doesn't have his finger prints on file.

I have always enjoyed these shows, all the way back from the Lone Texas Ranger who wore a mask so he wouldn't be recognized by the men who ambushed him and his pose

4016043,4,B002ZCY85E,"The rate of success for adapting a comic book into a successful TV show without screwing everything up is rare. This is the second attempt to make ""Human Target"" into a TV series--the first time was with actor/singer Rick Springfield in the lead. It lasted seven episode. This version of ""Human Target"" successfully jumps the gap nicely captures the best elements of the comic series created by Len Wein and Carmine Infantino and adding elements that make the concept work better for TV.

""Human Target"" focuses on Christopher Chance (Mark Valley)who along with his partner former police detective Winston (Chi McBride) provides private protection as a last resort for those in danger of being killed. Chance and Winston rely on a former assassin who can find out anything named Guerrero (Jackie Earl Haley)to discover who is trying to kill their clients in high octane action driven episodes. In the original comic book Chance would take on the identity of the target but here he inserts himself into their lives to protect them.

""Human Target"" is a terrific show--well written, directed and made. Mark Valley who appeared on ""Fringe"" and ""Boston Legal"" perfectly captures Chance's character. Haley and McBride are both perfect for their roles bringing jus the right level of levity and seriousness to the show. Jackie Earl Haley (who was in the original ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Watchmen"")does a terrific job as does Chi MacBride from ""Pushing Dasies"" and ""The Frighteners"".

The Blu-ray has a crisp, colorful picture. Audio sounds quite good although it's not lossless.

We get a featurette on the transition from print to screen, a featurette on the action sequences on the show as well as a commentary track on the pilot episode with Valley, McBride and writer/executive producer Jonathan Steinberg.

""Human Target"" manages to capture the fun qualities of the original character and translate it to the TV screen. With great performances, production values and writing/directing this target is well worth acquiring.",1293753600,2,2022,5.152439024390244

4016073,5,B002ZCY85E,"OK, having just watched the entire first season of 'Human Target' on DVD, I have to say that it is wonderful! Sure, you have to check your sense of reality at the door, suspend your belief in what you know can and simply cannot happen to one man's body through most all of these fights, but all that aside, there is nothing like it on TV at this time - and hasn't been (save, perhaps in parts, '24') for a long time.

Part James Bond, part Indiana Jones (even the music from Bear McCreary is created with that subtle triumphant Indy swagger to it after he wins a battle!), 'Human Target' takes us all over America with Christoper Chance, played in fine style by Mark Velley (Boston Legal).

The twelve episodes are well crafted and brilliantly acted, but when you have the always-awesome Chi McBride (Boston Public) on your side, here in the form of Winston, the head of this secret operative group, well, you know (the sadly UNDERappreciated 'Pushing Daisies,' anyone?!) you've got a winner of a show on your hands! Also, the odd (little) man out, Guerrero, is given such a mysterious allure by Jackie Earle Haley (Watchmen) that you can't help but think of him as a snuggly, uncaged (pet) rat!

That said, and getting just a little bit quirky about certain things that tend to repeat, Guerrero HAS to stop saying ""Dude"" every other sentence; Baptiste (Lennie James - 'Jericho') HAS to stop saying ""Mate"" every other sentence; and Chance a) has to lose some of that belly fat for the second season (come on now people, you know this is true!), and b) has to start to limp once or twice - the amount of complete and utter beatings he gets each episode!

BUT, hold the presses ... the truly beautiful, and so talented Emmaunelle Vaugier (Two and a Half Men) as the fearless FBI Special Agent Emma Barnes, is a perfect match for Mark Valley's Christopher Chance. Thankfully, after the red dress episode, we get to see her again - let's hope see appears more in season two!

From the pilot (with a corny CGI'd super train) to the season finale (where guest star Lee Majors is sadly under used!), the twists and turns (complete with requisite flashbacks) are all over the place. This is a truly wonderful series which deserves a second season - if not to take us further into knowning what happened at the end of the first season cliffhanger!",1286409600,2,2338,4.570405727923628
4016074,5,B002ZCY85E,"I LOVE ""Human Target: The Complete First Season""! It is 21st century escapist TV adventure at it's best, with cinematic sweep, wonderful characterizations, tongue-in-cheek humor, and wall-to-wall action. It captures the action/adventure genre so well that it is easy to forget it's a weekly television series, shot in eight days on a limited budget. The episodes 'feel' like movies, right down to the rousing symphonic scores (composed by Bear McCreary), and the superb production design (by David Willson).

Based, very loosely, on an intriguing 1970s 'second-feature' DC Comics series, created by the legendary Len Wein and Carmine Infantino, the original concept (with Christopher Chance, a la ""Mission Impossible"" master of disguise Rollin Hand, using plastic surgery and other means to 'become' potential targets, while his own persona remained a cypher), had been attempted, unsuccessfully, as a series in 1992, with Rick Springfield as Chance; the reliance on disguise damaged the TV audience's ability to bond with the lead, so the concept was 'tweaked' with Chance (now portrayed with easy-going charm by Mark Valley), becoming a bodyguard/protector rather than a clone, and still a 'human target' for potential assassins. Valley's Chance is an enigma, an ex-assassin who 'walked away' after the murder of a loved one, and with his friends/colleagues, ex-police detective Laverne Winston (husky, authoritative Chi McBride), and intense, deceptively dangerous Guerrero (the fabulous Jackie Earle Haley), they take on impossible 'David/Goliath' jobs, around the globe.

While a storyline occasionally stretches credibility (Chance flying a passenger jet upside-down to put out a fire in the undercarriage), or historic accuracy (in one episode he protects the 'Princess of Wales', Heir Apparent to a rather young-looking British Queen...uh, Elizabeth?), it is done so quickly, and with such panache, that you'll shrug and go along for the ride. Trust me, watch just one episode, and you'll be hooked!

Chance's too sidekicks are a nice balance and of course there is always the ""girl"" of the week.

The twelve episodes are well crafted and brilliantly acted.  The plots are outrageous, but it is different from anything on currently.

Christopher Chance is played by Mark Valley (Boston Legal). Winston, the head of this secret operative group, is brought to life, sizzling life, by Chi McBride (Boston Public).  The odd man out, Guerrero, is given such a mysterious allure by Jackie Earle Haley (various film and television roles).

These three form a triad which keeps you guessing week from week about their motivations, their past and their apparent commitment to each other.  Guerrero seems to be full of surprises.

Beautiful and talented Emmaunelle Vaugier, the fearless FBI Special Agent Emma Barnes, is a perfect match for Mark Valley's Christopher Chance.  Let's hope we see more of her in the second season.

From the pilot with a super train to the season finale of twists and turns and flashbacks, you have an excellent series which does not take itself seriously.  A number of comparisons have been made to Jack Bauer, but Christopher Chance is not a serious commentary on contemporary society.  It is just fun with great stories, plenty of action, daring skills, and a full slate of guest stars.

Fox has it on Friday nights this Fall.  As everyone knows, Friday nights are a terrible time slot.  Let's hope Fox gives it a full 22 episode run.",1276214400,41,1448,4.857142857142857

The show get's a little formulaic but it's a great formula that is delivered with witty dialog and fun action.",1273968000,13,281,4.529411764705882

4016108,5,B002ZCY85E,"Chi McBride is great as usal, Jackie Earle Haley EXCELLENT a couple of the middle epsidoes are not as strong as the opening but the season finale, knocks it out of the park and has a great list of ""guest stars"" inclinding Amy Acker, Armand Asanti, Lennie James and Lee Majors !!

The star can be facing certain death and give you a ""ho hum"" I'll be fine because I'm so cool...performance. It is very irritating and I just struggle to like this show.",1271808000,2,302,4.392857142857143

With tongue most often in cheek, this series goes around the globe with Christoper Chance doing his James Bond style protection of the innocent and the endangered.  Shot in HD, the show is visually stunning- can't wait for the Blu-Ray discs.",1271203200,43,320,4.907407407407407
