8117673,4,B000F5EHG8,"Maybe it's because AMERICANS are all caught in the ""CHITTLIN' CIRCUIT HIP HOP TEENY BOPPER AGE""! In short; STUPID!! A great movie I've searched High & Low for and it's available in REGION 4 format?? VERY COOWELL flick with great performances and music! Too deep for STUPID AMERICAN audiences! I WANT THIS MOVIE! ....Peace.",1234656000,,322,4.981481481481482

I FIRST SAW IT ON PREMIUM CABLE TV ABOUT 8 YEARS AGO AND IT BLEW ME AWAY. ONE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A JAZZ AFICIONADO TO DIG IT BUT IT HELPS. JEFF GOLDBLOUM AND FOREST WHITAKER GIVE OUTSTANDING PORTRAYALS OF TWO NEW YORK STUDIO MUSICIANS WHO PLAY MUSICAL GARBAGE EVERYDAY SO THAT THEY CAN OCCASIONALLY DELVE INTO THE MUSIC THEY LOVE, JAZZ!  THE STORY ITSELF ISN'T ONE OF EPOCH PROPORTIONS BUT IT TELLS A TALE OF WONDROUS DELIGHT.  KATHY BAKER AND A HOST OF MARVELOUS MUSICIANS MAKE THIS A MOVIE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO MISS.  HERE'S HOPING SOME DVD MOGUL HAS THE GUTS AND GOOD SENSE TO RELEASE THIS MOVIE IN REGION 1 MODE.",1234224000,,964,5.449664429530201

  good is a 15 year-old movie

  RELEASE IN A REGION 4 FORMAT ??

  THIS  IS  SO  DAMN  STUPID  !!  It wouldn't play on
