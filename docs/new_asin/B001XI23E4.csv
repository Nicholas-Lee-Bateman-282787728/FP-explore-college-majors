3827277,3,B001XI23E4,I tried out these exercises and I couldn't seem to induce the tremors at all.  I ended up giving my video to a friend.  Bummer.,1293494400,6,127,4.04
3827278,5,B001XI23E4,"The trauma release exercises have become a reliable way for me to clear out worry, stress, cerebral static, call it what you will.
I at first needed several attempts (and some patience) in order to get the hang of TRE; since then it has become a repeatable routine.
All in all, TRE is a remarkable and valuable technique for calming and being able to focus on things other than the chattering foreground.",1273363200,15,404,4.625
3827279,4,B001XI23E4,"As far as the content goes I think it is very good.  The explanations are good and the exercises are simple and effective.  The format is not good at all, however.  The quality of the video leaves much to be desired, looking like the video on an old TV with rabbit ears which can't pull in a sharp picture.  But I can accept that.

What I didn't like was there were no chapters made available for easy accessing of material.  You can't go back and review things you want to focus on.  Instead, you have to start from the very beginning and wait until the relevant points come up - very inconvenient.  I would advise people to watch it first without trying to do the exercises and use the pause button frequently, and take notes on each exercise before going on to the next one.  Or, buy the book too and have that on hand in case you want to review something carefully.

If this would have a menu and chapters I would give this 5 stars, poor picture quality notwithstanding.",1246233600,71,974,4.331491712707182
3827280,5,B001XI23E4,"I was a little skeptical when I first started the exercises which are different from any thing I have ever seen .I was however impressed with Dr Berceli and the therapist interviewed. I am now a true believer. The exercises are easy and work!

My sleep quality is better and I am calmer .Even though the economy has been very scary , the exercises have given  me a freedom from excessive worry. I am very grateful.",1241222400,24,414,4.434210526315789
3827281,5,B001XI23E4,"After a recommendation from a friend ,I ordered Dr. Berceli's book and DVD Step by Step Demonstration to help with stress release. The book was very helpful and inspiring, but the DVD gave me the confidence to try the exercises .

Initially, I was a little skeptical that the exercises would be valuable, but I quickly became a true believer .I did the exercise for about 15 minutes over several months about 20 times  often after  my regular exercise. After about the fourth session I started sleeping like a baby. My blood pressure and resting heart rate seem to have both dropped permanently. I have tried other relaxation techniques over the years with little success. even though they do not take  a lot of effort .Dr .Berceli's exercises  make me feel relaxed and alert but not sleepy

It has almost been a year ,I am now a much happier optimistic person even though I now  do the exercises only just occasionally  when I feel out of balance or start to worry in excess.

I would definitely get the DVD with the book. Be skeptical, but I think you will pleasantly surprised after 4 or 5 sessions.",1241136000,43,1102,4.581632653061225
3827282,5,B001XI23E4,These exercises helped me gain flexibility and release tension. I would recommend them to everyone.,1241049600,5,99,5.666666666666667
3827283,5,B001XI23E4,"Personally this is most useful!  Professionally it was a God-send!  I had sciatic nerve pain in my hip for 3 years.  The second time I used these exercises this pain was relieved and now several years later the pain is still gone!!  I also experienced emotional release that I had not been able to ""get to"" and felt tremendous healing from some old grief through the use of these exercises.  These exercise have continued to help me manage the stress and tension in my own life since 2003.

Professionally I have a LCSW private practice specializing in trauma and addictions.  I began to integrate these exercises into my work with clients and found them to be of great help in the healing process for my clients who had been traumatized and with those who live with chronic stress.

This DVD does a excellent job of demonstrating these simple exercises.  They are easy to learn.  This will be money well spent if you are looking for healing from trauma or to better manage chronic stress in your life.",1237680000,76,1002,4.610169491525424

Example: five mornings out of seven I wake up WITHOUT back pain, where previously I awoke in pain (7 on a scale of 1 to 10) daily. The nighttime bracing that I was unaware of until recently is not occurring as regularly. My jaw does not seem to be as sore, so the bruxing is also dissipating. The more often I do the exercises, the more relief I have and the more restful my sleep. (The quality of this DVD is poor, but the content is invaluable.)",1423526400,7,618,4.477876106194691

3827306,5,B001XI23E4,"This was incredible and I think everyone has explained the technique well in the other reviews, so I won't go into it. I just want to add that it works, it's easy and it's very gentle. I felt good when I did it, not emotional, not exhausted. Just good. Like I had a really good massage. Afterwards I felt lighter and more energized. Like a great weight had been lifted.

As for the video quality, the information is clear, accessible and easy to follow. Yes it's a bit grainy and not as polished as some, but it's not about that...it's just like David Bercelli comes across, simple and unadorned.

The quality of DVD does not affect the quality of the information.

3827308,5,B001XI23E4,"Don't let the title limit you.  We could all use a method of release the tension we store in our bodies.  Sometimes this comes from major trauma  (and in fact, David Bercelli would not have come up with this program without experiencing some pretty major trauma environments), but sometimes it comes from little things...someone cutting you off in traffic, daily stress with your job, or kids, or whatever...all those little things add up and end up stored in a similar way to the 'bigger' stuff.

This program gives you a specific, usable tool to release those stored tension patterns from your body.  In fact, I know that more and more therapists are incorporating TRE into their practice modalities, and if you have a significant trauma history, you're probably better off doing it under guidance from a therapist or certified TRE practitioner.  However, the majority of us can do this quite effectively by ourselves and this video gives you the tools to get started.

A few notes:  a) the mind body connection is very real...TRE deals directly with your body, but the release of stored tension patterns in your body will have a very real effect on your mind; b) a lot of trauma related treatments require you to relive or at least think about your trauma events...this does not...you don't have to go back down those roads...your body will do what it needs to do regardless of what you're thinking about; c) this works as well (actually, a little easier) for out of shape folks as those in better physical condition...

Basically, what I'm saying is try it...and if you want more info on TRE (like where to find an actual certified therapist or trainer), search Bercelli on the web",1368144000,12,1685,4.7827586206896555
3827309,5,B001XI23E4,Ive tried all types of Trauma Therapy and most of them have been enormously expensive and take a long time to get results. TRE is what I've been looking for as just from the book and DVD I can help my body release its trauma... by myself! That is what makes sense to me anyway... that the body has ITS OWN WAY TO RELEASE STRESS AND TRAUMA. With such a miraculous and amazing organism as our bodies how could it not have its own innate system for balancing itself? Berceli has created such simple ways to turn on the body's wisdom to do what it already knows how to do! Great!,1359849600,13,575,4.1891891891891895

This is a very important video. It is excellent work. However, I caution everyone. to not approach this work unless you definitely are conscious of your trauma history. If you Think something happened and aren't Sure, do not use this video. It will release things that could fracture your psyche unless you have many therapeutic & spiritual tools that have a proven track record of working, in your toolbox for self healing. This is not recreational stuff. This work stimulates extremely deep somatic and emotional release. As a counselor and healer in the field of self- recovery for over 30 years,I stress the potency,value and possible danger of doing this work alone . It would best be done in a support group with a trained and competent facilitator. Enjoy your journey to wellness.
