7987765,4,B00008XRY5,"Ok early 70's Mexican-made, Spanish-language (with English subtitles) Santo vs someone flick.  This time he teams up with Blue Demon, another masked wrestler, to battle a nutso Dr. Frankenstein.  The bad doctor is transplanting brains back and forth for the usual unclear crazy non-reasons.  The wrestling bouts are interminable and seem to be filmed in a stage without a live audience.  The spectators were filmed separately and both scenes stitched together.  The quality of the DVD is clear, fine and very good quality.  Recommended for fans of this particular genre.",1413158400,,570,5.277777777777778

7987768,5,B00008XRY5,"This is the first Santo film I've seen and it was great! A crazy story about brain transplants, Dr. Frankenstein and a couple of wrestlers who save the day. This Santo film is a perfect Saturday afternoon film. It's only setback, subtitles. I don't mind them but I know a lot of people aren't subtitle fans.",1350000000,5,307,4.5
7987769,3,B00008XRY5,"It is fun and amusing in a weird sort of way to view these 1960's Mexi-Versions of Frankenstein! More of a 60's Study in Foreign Films with all the odd happenings and rich use of color! I recommend instead ""Santo Contra La Hija De Frankenstein"" (Santo vs. The Daughter of Frankenstein)a MUCH better Film! Viva La Frankenstein!",1349308800,3,326,4.7368421052631575
7987770,2,B00008XRY5,"It's funny for the scene where Santo and the Blue Demon wear their masks while double-dating with two women at a fancy restaurant.
The rest it fairly tedious.",1256342400,2,158,4.678571428571429
