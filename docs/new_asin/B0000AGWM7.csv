7996988,1,B0000AGWM7,"I have seen many Boris Karloff films.  Some are great, some are good, some are fair, some are poor. Then there's ""Snake People.""  It is abysmal.  I have avoided the four cheapo Mexican-U.S. films he knocked off in 1968 before his death, because of bad reviews, but finally made myself watch this one.  Right off the bat, I hate any movie where animals are really hurt, and this one begins with a dwarf voodoo priest chopping the head off a chicken. They cut away for that, but I suspect it was for real.  All the sets look like something you would see in a bad Saturday Night Live skit. The actors are mainly terrible, and much of the footage is badly lit and out of focus.  Even if it looked more professional, it would still be very stupid and derivative of old zombie films like ""I Walked With a Zombie"" (1943).  Karloff plays a kind of chemical scientist on a Caribbean island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean! Of course, there is more to the kindly old fellow than meets the eye.  Karloff delivers a professional performance but you can't make a silk purse out of snake skin, and boy there are lots of shots of snakes here, I suspect mistreated by the filmmakers.  If the sight of a snake terrifies you, maybe this is creepy, but personally I don't care.  At some points a stand-in for Karloff is obviously used, also somebody trying to do his dialog who sounds nothing like him.  A third-grader with a video camera could probably make a better film than ""Snake People.""  If this is what Karloff was willing to do for money at the end of his life, he was perhaps fortunate that Mr. Death prevented him from running down his high quality reputation further.  I do NOT want to see the other three stinkers from this four-picture deal under any circumstances!",1504310400,,1763,4.471875
7996989,1,B0000AGWM7,"People tend to shake their heads over the state of Bela Lugosi, who ended his life in a series of hilariously dire movies directed by Ed Woodand manage to forget about the equally awful movies made by Boris Karloff near the end of his life when he signed a contract to appear in four Mexican-made horror films.

At this point Karloff was in extremely poor health, and his doctors forbade him to travel to Mexico.  In the upshot, Karloff shot all his scenes on a Hollywood soundstage and the rest of the scenes were filmed in Mexico using a Karloff double when necessary.  The resulting films were vile, with THE ISLE OF THE SNAKE PEOPLE (also known as SNAKE PEOPLE) released in 1971, about two years after Karloffs death.

The plot is extremely haphazard.  A young woman travels to an island to live with her uncle (Karloff) and becomes romantically involved with a law enforcement officer and accidentally involved with a Voodoo-like cult that seems to involve a cootchie dancer who dances with a snake.  There are also a few zombies, a few cannibal women, and lots and lots of out-of-focus shots in an effort to add an arty aura to a film that doesnt make any sense.

Now, truth be told, I have indeed seen worse Karloff films (some of the Corman films are unwatchable), and this isn't quite as bad as the worst.  Even so, I don't recommend it unless you are a die-hard fan determined to see everything Karloff put on film.

7996990,2,B0000AGWM7,"Capt. Pierre Labesch (Ralph Bertrand) is assigned to an island that practices Voodoo but is not Haiti. He plans to stop all outlawed local customs. Meanwhile Anabella (Julissa) travels to the island to visit her uncle (Boris Karloff).

This film has a number of Hollywood versions of Voodoo customs and dances to bore most avid film watchers. Yes, Boris is in the film, but that didn't make it any better. Normally you can't go wrong with a film that has Boris, a midget in a top hat, and a female belly dancer with a snake. But under it all, it really is a stinker.

7996991,4,B0000AGWM7,"OK, ""Snake People"" doesn't make any sense at all, but aside from the plot, there some great voodoo scenes and the erotic dancing kept my eyes firmly glued to the screen. (I think the scruffy white guy who resurrects a zombie to be his girlfriend is the overseer of Karloff's plantation). Anyway, forget trying to figure out the plot and just enjoy this high octane romp.",1288310400,2,370,4.621212121212121
7996992,1,B0000AGWM7,"Snake People is a low badged movie. Its a very bad movie. Doesn't make sence. This is a coproduction betweeen US and Mexico. The script is terrible. I don't recomend this movie to anyone. I gave this movie 1 star, but I can give 0 star because is one of the worse movies I ever seen. This was Boris Karloff last movie and the worst he ever filmed.",1174089600,,347,4.117647058823529
7996993,3,B0000AGWM7,"I have no idea what THE SNAKE PEOPLE was all about and I suspect no one involved with the production knew either.  Least of all was probably poor old Boris Karloff who made this film very near the end of his life.  While the large majority of the film was shot in Mexico (in a neat reversal for anyone who has seen Charlton Heston in TOUCH OF EVIL, here several Mexican actors and actresses are playing Caucasians), Karloff never left a sound stage in California.  As disjointed as it sounds for a movie to take place with its star far removed from his surroundings and his co-stars, even the non-Karloff scenes add up to a lot of nothing.  I've seen many low budget films, but it really is rare to see one that so blatantly throws random images and sequences upon the screen with so little regard for order, logic or reason.

For starters, let's take the opening scene.  A witch doctor and what I assume to be his follower are performing a voodoo ceremony.  The witch doctor is a dwarf.  He's wearing a very neat, black suit jacket, a blue Hawaiian shirt, a black top hat, white opera gloves and some seriously nice bling around his neck.  He wears his sunglasses at night.  He raises a woman from the dead.  Costuming aside, it's a fairly standard scene for a voodoo movie.  Except that there is no context here, nor does the film ever reveal any.  Why does the witch doctor affect a James Bond villain style cackle throughout the entire ceremony?  Why does he start sobbing and rubbing his companion's hand across his face?

My guess is that the only reason this film has even the relatively low status associated with a One Dollar DVD release is the inclusion of Boris Karloff.  As noted above, he is far removed from the action.  Even before I consulted the Internet, one could tell that Karloff was not a well man when he made this.  Not only was he not able to travel to Mexico for filming, most of the scenes he is in feature him sitting down.  When he does stand it is with use of a cane, and his only relatively strenuous sequence requires that he lean heavily on a table.  It's actually depressing, especially if one is used to seeing a younger, more robust Karloff holding his own with various monsters and heroes.

In the scenes where Karloff would have to interact with his fellow cast members in Mexico, the character helpfully dons a black, face-covering ski-mask and sunglasses.  But don't worry, he'll still be smoking his cigar, so you won't miss that it's him.  Although actually the double looks more like Groucho Marx ready to hold up a liquor store than he resembles Boris Karloff.  I couldn't help but whistle ""Hooray For Captain Spaulding"" whenever he appeared.

The story begins with Karloff's niece coming to visit him on the remote Pacific island where he makes his home.  The niece is an rabid prohibitionist and is hoping her uncle will support the organization to which she belongs.  What actual support he could provide from his remote bachelor pad/island is not obvious.  Of course, once she catches up with Karloff all thoughts of continuing the cause are forgotten (apart from a few scenes where she lightly admonishes her love interest's drinking habits).

Naturally, this being a remote colonial island, there are all manner of cultists and so forth.  Now here is where the story begins breaking down.  The island contains a voodoo cult, a roaming gang of cannibal woman (who hide in the shadows and suddenly leap out at their victims and eat them raw) and a religion of people where somehow snakes are involved in their ceremonies.  I paid close attention both times I watched this film, and I'm still not sure what all these groups have to do with each other.  The snake people are killing folks with snake venom.  The voodoo people are raising them up again.  And the cannibal woman are eating the living.  I'm not sure how they are related.  Are they all the snake people of the title?  Are the voodoo people and cannibals merely a subset of the snake people?  Are they allies?  The cannibal women seem completely on their own, and I simply could not work out the relationship these groups had.  I suspect the cannibal woman escaped from some other movie set and spent their time running in and out of the shooting script for this film.

The niece isn't the only newcomer to the island.  The land is a French possession, and a French captain of police has arrived in order to suppress the local witchcraft because of concerns on ""the mainland"".  The movie is very vague on its moral message.  It jumps repeatedly back and forth between arguing that the Europeans shouldn't be interfering in other people's religions and saying that the natives' religion is nuttier than squirrel poop and of course it should be stopped.

I had a very difficult time tying enough of the plot strands together to present it to you in a coherent fashion.  Then I figured that if the producers didn't care, then I won't either.  I'll simply list some of the more notable sub-plots:

1. Karloff and his maid are doing some sort of experimentation in telekinesis and pyrokinesis.  He claims that moving small mirrors on a table and the ability to light grass on fire will rid the world of disease, war and even death.  Good luck with all that.  As you may imagine, the experimentation/scientific aspect of this disappears after its initial scene.  I have no idea if this plot point is something he learned from the voodoo people, the snake people or the cannibal people.  (See above.  Maybe Karloff acquired it from all three.)

2. A random filthy white guy on the island attempts dancing with -- and later seducing -- a reanimated female corpse.  This is just as icky as it sounds.  I can't figure out who this guy is supposed to be.  He's shown in one scene to be a Karloff's friend, but there's no explanation as to what he's doing.  Is he a fellow scientist?  Was he shipwrecked?  Is he a traveler?  Is he a witch doctor?  Is he a voodoo practitioner?  Apart from admiring his panama hat, I could find no purpose for his inclusion in the film.

3. Karloff's maid (who looks shockingly like Fergie from The Black Eyed Peas) keeps belly-dancing with a snake.  I'm sure this is supposed to demonstrate something about the snake people's religion, but I have no idea what that could be.

4.  If you thought the ""belly-dancing with a snake"" line above was just overflowing with tawdry innuendo, then wait until you get a load of the niece's dream sequence.  All I say is that she dreams that there are two of her and one keeps putting a snake in her mouth.

That disparate list should give you some idea of the mental gymnastics your brain will have to undergo to follow the story.  And it's a good indication of what the movie feels like as a whole.  Not only are random plot points brought up and immediately thrown away, on the visual side, images and shots are handled the same way, with apparently random pictures being indiscriminately hurled at the viewer.  The niece's dream sequence is typical.  Apart from being loaded with strange sexual imagery and cheap camera tricks (apparently, if you stop film, you can make people blink in and out of existence!), what is the point of it?  It doesn't seem to reference any other part of the film.  It doesn't affect the way she acts afterwards.  It's random imagery for the sake of random imagery.

Now all that being said, I can't say I didn't like it.  Usually I get annoyed when a director or writer throws me ninety minutes of surrealism because he finds coherency too hard.  But for some reason I found this vaguely appealing.  I'm sure most of this sprung from the fact that I was staring at the screen with my jaw in my lap unable to believe that anyone thought they could get away with this.  The movie is relatively coherent through the first third, but it was about at that point that I mentally pictured the director throwing his hands in the air and deciding that anything goes (""We have footage of snakes popping in and out of existence on a coat rack?  Yeah, let's go with that!"").  I have to admire the sheer audacity involved.

I feel that I have somewhat cheated in this review by simply relating things that occurred and following that by saying that I didn't understand what it was about.  But at least I'm being honest.  Most of this film simply defies rationality.  I dare anyone to watch this film and not be entertained by the sheer randomness of the experience.  Although I should warn anyone squeamish that I think the filmmakers really did chop the head off of a live chicken in the opening scene.  Viewer beware.",1168473600,9,8607,4.588582677165355
7996994,1,B0000AGWM7,"In retrospect, it's a good thing Boris Karloff didn't live to see this trashy horror flick. The ailing, 80-year-old actor was glad to be working, but he could have selected a better project than ""The Snake People."" Judging by his limited footage, Karloff probably didn't know (or care) what kind of schlock he was making. Sadly, this is exploitation filmmaking of the worst kind. For Karloff completists only.",1095379200,9,409,5.029411764705882
