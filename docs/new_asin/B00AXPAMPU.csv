8558935,5,B00AXPAMPU,"ive ordeedr other foreign disks in the past and been disappointed, they have been obvious pirated copies etc. this time I was really pleased, its clearly a licensed product (most likely from either Taiwan or hong king).
<edit> unless the Razzak sub team is part of Asahi TV then this isn't licensed :( On the positive side the video quality is still great.

Quality is excellent and really adds value as compared to what I was watching (youtube and one of the many .drama streams).

Would buy again :)",1429142400,,501,4.617977528089888
8558936,5,B00AXPAMPU,"Doctor X is my favorite series on Japan's NHK channel.  It manages to be totally gripping as it shows this skilled female surgeon performing deft and daring surgeries on difficult cases where the patient's life is hanging in the balance.  The music cues our tears to well up during the many moving scenes where the doctor levels with her patients.  The scenes of Michiko Daimon theatrically refusing to toe the line by deferring to the medical establishment are over the top, but I find myself smiling.  Her body language is disrespectful, irreverent.  She stretches her arms over her head, yawns, rolls her eyes, yells, pours pure sugar water into a glass to gulp down after exhausting surgeries.  She plays ping pong and mah jong and dances in high heels at discos in Tokyo.  She steps in where other colleagues and superiors sweat, faint, or mess up in the operating theater, elbowing them aside.  She is able to charge high prices for each surgery as a free lancer represented by her live in companion, but gets no respect from those around her.  Until...they see how cool she is under fire, and how skillful at doing the most difficult, ground-breaking surgeries.  After the surgery is finished, she goes around to the patient's head, and rests her palm on their shoulder to send healing and compassionate vibrations.  I cannot wait to see if the series continues.  I have watched the episodes again and again (mostly because I am learning Japanese and I can't understand it unless I watch them fifteen times in a row!)",1422748800,2,1524,4.796934865900383
