8152527,5,B000JMKKW2,It's challenging and different. I have three out of this set. I just need the one b with Susan Harris to complete the set.,1411862400,,122,4.125
8152528,5,B000JMKKW2,Tracy Long's workouts are great!  They are tough and you know you have burned some serious calories when you finish!,1379635200,,116,4.8
8152529,3,B000JMKKW2,"This is mostly a strength routine, but upper/lower are used at the same time - so it keeps your heartrate up. Mine is usually at 50-60% of maximum. Tracie seems a little robotic and soft-spoken, I like Jen Carmen better in Endurance For Movement. That being said, for people who are fans of The Firm DVDs - this would be the next level. More interesting routines and more endurance - as the title says.",1234742400,,402,4.445945945945946
8152530,4,B000JMKKW2,"There is a review on here that says she couldn't get her heart rate up doing this work out... she must be doing it wrong or a super human. This work out is very hard to me. My husband even likes doing this one with me. It feels very athletic, and you are never bored doing it. It's Tracie to a T. Creative moves, works your buns and hips to death and you are dead tired by the end. The mountain climbers get me EVERY TIME. As do the push ups on the dumb bells while lifting the bell. That is the hardest part. I always feel really strong after I finish this one. I don't enjoy this one as much as BBBB, but it is a harder one, and it's great to add to the mix.",1228348800,,660,3.8248175182481754
8152531,5,B000JMKKW2,"I tried this video today and really enjoyed it! I'm an intermediate exerciser and found this to be challenging without being overly complex. I used the standard 3, 5, 8 lb dumbbells for light, medium and heavy and was able to follow her without any difficulty. I would consider this more of a circuit workout than a strength or cardio only video - a great total body experience.

Pros:
- Good combination of cardio and strength moves to keep your heart rate up
- Lots of functional fitness moves to build your core and strengthen commonly used muscles
- Beginner and advanced modifications are shown so it is easy to progress up

Cons:
- Cueing is not great. I would recommend watching the video at least once so you know what to expect next because a lot of times she cues right as she starts the movements.",1196121600,4,808,4.489795918367347
8152532,1,B000JMKKW2,"I have always liked Tracie Long and am a fan of her and all the firm tapes, at 60 years of age I have been doing many of the FIRMS's intermediate/advanced workouts plus other aerobic tapes and treadmill work for the past 12 years to keep myself active and take care of things such as blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. which appears to have worked I'm happy to report.  But I was sorely disappointed in this tape, especially since Tracie Long was featured I had great expectations, but this tape (1) did not get my heart up or make me sweat at all and (2) what is this thing with sliding your hand/feet on the floor with rags!!!  I work out on carpet so I thought I would go to a wood floor in the house and try it and as I was doing it I had to ask myself what is this all about???  The little cardio that is in this tape is in extremely short bursts - didn't even breath hard and the weight work is whimpy at best unless you bulk up more than the recommended weight that helps.  The main thing this tape does is get you working on your balance and if you are really bad with balance forget this tape it won't work for you. The cuing is bad as well and I would have expected more from Tracie.  I did this 3 times trying to make myself like it but this AM was the last it is going in my garage sale box.",1192060800,10,1302,4.011583011583012
8152533,5,B000JMKKW2,"To be honest, I'd never heard of Tracie Long before, but saw this at a store and thought I'd give it a go.  I'm so glad I did, because it's a fantastic workout.  With easy enough choreography, it's a total body workout and it's perfect for experienced exercisers and advanced too.
She cues really well and throughout, the workout is interval training and she includes some amazing creative movements and you are never bored.  You can follow along easy enough but it's tough going.  Your heart rate will stay elevated throughout the workout.
All you need is a stability ball and dumbells.  It's really different and fun and based on this dvd, I'd very happily purchase more of her dvds and try other routines.  She's a great instructor and this workout is very fun to do and I'm sure the results are beginning to show.  I love it.",1182470400,11,829,4.5608108108108105
8152534,4,B000JMKKW2,"Endurance for Movement (EFM) is one of four new functional fitness workouts from the Tracie Long Training (TLT) group. The concept of functional fitness means that the exercises are designed to mimic the movements you perform in ""real"" life, often by emphasizing balance and other core-strengthening moves. Tracie describes EFM as an ""integrated"" workout which uses a stability ball, dumbbells, and ""rag"" work (see below) to provide full-body strength training as well as cardio benefits. Tracie Long herself leads this video, and as with all of the TLT workouts, she works out with two companions: Nancy, who is showing modified versions of the exercises, and Linda Marie, who does some more challenging moves. There is no chapter menu on the DVD, but it is chaptered, so you can skip around as needed.

This 60-minute workout begins with multi-planar lunges using light weights; there are also arm reaches to the side to stretch your torso. The first time through, I had a little trouble following along, as Tracie does not always cue the next move in advance. Also, the warm-up moves pretty quickly, and I found myself immediately feeling tired. A unique stretch segment consists of walking planks--Tracie calls these ""caterpillers""--and hamstring stretches; both felt good, but I wasn't sure if I was maintaining correct form. Next, Tracie moves on to the first segment of core work using the stability ball: lying face-down with the ball under your pelvis, you do mermaids, which involve lifting your legs, and frogs, which involve drawing the heels in. A tough move follows in which you lie with your thighs on the ball and then roll your torso from side-to-side so that your hips stack; very challenging! Then it's back to standing for the first cardio segment, which begins with lunge kicks and progresses to stride jumps. In-between doing the two sides, Tracie includes some higher impact work with fast jogs and butt kicks (Nancy does show a reduced range of motion here, but she still does high impact). Following this, you pick up your weights for the first time (Tracie suggests 3-8 lbs.) for side lunges with rotating overhead presses. Continuing with the heavy lower body work, Tracie does a unique 1-leg squat move in which you raise your heel on 1 leg, squat down on the other, hike your glutes (a variation on good mornings), and then return to standing, progressing to raising the knee on the non-working leg. In-between legs comes some more plyometric work with 1-leg hops. This section ends another different variation on a traditional move: you do a squat with a 1-arm row (palms up), but you keep the shoulder of the opposite arm pinned back the entire time.

Going back to the floor for some additional plank work (using the ball is optional), Tracie alternately lifts each leg, bringing the knee in to work the obliques. Then everyone uses the ball for supermans: without any weights, you squeeze your arms and shoulders straight back, then back and down. Ready for more cardio? This time it's side kicks with jumping jacks in-between; there's also a fun little front lunge/hop sequence. After the cardio, you do your first segment of ""rag"" work, where you use rags under your limbs (or paper plate if you're working on carpet) to facilitate gliding. Here, you start with push-ups with your hands on dumbbells (this bothers me, so I skipped the dumbbells) and feet on rags (optional), progressing to side plank with dumbbell rotation. Next, everyone puts the rags under their feet for ""mountain climbers,"" where you slowly, then faster, pull one knee at a time in and out to your chest. After a brief stretch, you repeat the exercise pulling BOTH knees in at the same time--this was extremely tough, and I couldn't complete all the reps even when I continued with one knee at a time.

At this point, you are about halfway through the workout (33 minutes), and in my opinion, the hardest part is over! You move back to standing for some additional heavy lower body work: starting in a dip position, you very slowly drag in the leg and raise to standing, lifting your knee and extending your hips. More push-ups follow, this time with one hand on the rang and pushing out to the side, then pushing forward for a nice lat stretch and finishing with tricep kickbacks on one knee. Moving back to the ball, you'll sit with the ball under the small of your back and do transverse crunches, eventually adding light weights to work the obliques. If you tuck your hips hard here, you can really feel these! Now it's time for the final cardio segment, which was fun. Tracie starts with ""Ali shuffles,"" or alternately hopping each foot to the front while moving to the side. Each series ends with optional squat jumps and a lunge with torso rotation. This sequence also includes a side shuffle with cobra arms (ie, squeezing the shoulders behind you) for more posture work. I really enjoyed the next segment as well, which consisted of clock lunges interspersed with push squats and cobra arms. Next comes the only standing rag work: you stand with the rag under one foot, pushing the leg out to a side squat and using the rag as a brake. This segment also includes glute hikes, bicep curls with overhead row, and 1-arm rows with torso rotations.

Finally, you move to the floor for abs work. Tracie holds a dumbbell between her feet for reverse curls; she then switches the dumbbell to her hands for a lat pullover with a 1-leg reverse crunch. After a final set of reverse curls, you're finished with the abs work, and Tracie performs a few traditional stretches on the floor, including a hip flexor stretch. From a kneeling position, she uses the ball for what she calls ""two of the best stretches I know,"" a lat and shoulder stretch--and she's right, these felt great! Moving to a standing position, Tracie uses the ball for some additional hip flexor and hamstring stretches, and you're done. This is an excellent workout, but of the four TLTs, it's my least favorite. It's clearly the hardest of these workouts, with more high impact work and plyometric moves (it's also the one that reminds me the most of Tracie's previous series, Tracie Long Productions; these were tough workouts that even Tracie herself has said were too difficult for the average exerciser). Although the cardio had more impact than I prefer, I really liked virtually all of the strength moves, which I found particularly unique and different here. Also, I loved Tracie's emphasis on posture and use of upper body moves (even when working the lower body) to enhance this.

In summary, I would recommend this workout to high intermediate and above exercisers who enjoy a challenge, like athletic-type moves, and don't mind high impact and plyometric work.",1170720000,14,6745,4.8464874241110145
