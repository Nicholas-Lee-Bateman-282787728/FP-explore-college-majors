2769250,5,B000NIWI9K,"This Glyndebourne production is the best I have seen. The singers and the staging and of course the direction are as good as one could wish. The orchestra has a few weaknesses, especially at the beginning, butis  still quite good.",1220745600,5,230,4.75
2769251,4,B000NIWI9K,"I hate to be the sole dissenter, but I don't think this is a five-star production. It has much to recommend it, mostly the splendid performance by Miah Persson as Fiordiligi. She navigates with great beauty and expression the two wickedly difficult arias that Mozart gave his soprano. The acting is also exceptionally strong in this production. Finally, the filming with an HD camera makes it the best looking opera I own on DVD.

But, other than Persson, I found the singing to be just average. One example. In performing the heavenly tenor aria, ""Un' aura amorosa,"" Topi Lehtipuu hits all the notes, but he doesn't put his heart and soul into this most moving of love songs. (Compare his performance to that of Shawn Mathey on the 2005 Aix-en-Province ""Cosi"" on DVD; Mathey's ""Un' aura amorosa,"" can bring tears to your eyes.)

It was a odd characteristic of the performances in this Glyndebourne production: with the exception of Miah Persson, the acting was more engaged and expressive than the singing. But If you liked Persson as Susanna in the recently released Covent Garden DVD of ""Marriage of Figaro,"" you are in for a real treat here. She truly shines as Fiordiligi (and is given so much more to sing than Susanna!).",1216598400,9,1227,4.783018867924528
2769252,5,B000NIWI9K,"Despite going to the opera for the first time when I was 7, it's taken me more than 20 years to really appreciate the artform and I've recently begun collecting DVDs. This production was the first Cos I ever heard or saw and - having seen a few more since then - will likely be the last. If I lost my mind and decided to watch it with the sound muted, I'd still be thoroughly entertained - the comic and dramatic talents of the players here is unsurpassable! I'm particularly fond of Anke Vondung's ditzy Dorabella, but everyone is amazing. I must say that the setting and costumes (no turbans, thank God!) adds to the already potent mixture. The clear and crisp sound of Fischer's well-conducted period instruments is pure joy. The four principal singers all do marvellous jobs and over the last few times I've watched the DVD, I've taken to counting the number of times you see any of them looking at the conductor... It may 'just' be fantastic video-editing (which is the case, no matter what), but the few and very discrete times I've caught them looking at Fischer can be counted on one hand - alltogether. Aside from indicating that the production is thoroughly rehearsed, it does wonders for keeping up the 4th wall between performers and audience.

Second, the cast.  The stage presence, incredible vocals, and chemistry of Nicolas Rivenq, Miah Persson, Anke Vondung, Luca Pisaroni, and Topi Lehtipuu work effortlessly.

Third, the direction of Nicholas Hytner was beautiful and did justice to what is certainly one of Mozart's best operas.

Fourth, the DVD.  I love the sound quality, the image quality and the editing.  It is incredibly difficult to transfer stage work to the screen.  I wouldn't trade this for a live show, but this comes about as close as I've seen for a DVD.  Blu ray is the only choice here...",1459382400,,768,5.064

He was a dramatist in his own right and a very good one. Though the premise of the opera is silly, it remains vital as opera. The performances linger with perfection and respect for the composition. Each of the solos and arias literally stand in their own and can be isolated for appreciation. I personally feel this is Mozart's best opera musically speaking.

2769271,5,B000NIWI9K,"Da Ponte has written an original libretto with characters both invented and adapted from literature. Although the superficial plot has some comic scenes, Mozart wrote the most beautiful music for the serious parts. The Second Act in particular is where the 4 main protagonists sing arias pouring out their young souls and confusions in matters of love with exquisite music as only Mozart could create.
The six singers are not very well known in the US. They do an excellent job; their singing is exactly what is needed in this opera, beautifully rendered. Their acting is jovial, fresh, sometimes even athletic, making their young characters very believable.
The sets and costumes are so clean and traditional that you immediately relate to the scenes. The sets were designed with filming in mind, and it shows. The images on this Blu-Ray are just perfect - clear backgrounds, colorful and very attractive but without too many details that could distract from the singers and the music.

2769277,5,B000NIWI9K,"What a marvel this is!  Mozart and Da Ponte's third and final opera together often gets overshadowed by their previous two, but this version on DVD is so good, it proves that this opera is at least the equal of Le Nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni.

For those who don't know the story: Ferrando and Guglielmo are arguing with their friend, Don Alfonso, who declares that all women are unfaithful.  They protest that their fiancees, sisters Fiordiligi and Dorabella, respectively, would never be unfaithful to them.  To prove it, they make a bet with him, in which he agrees to prove to them (in 24 hours) that their fiancees are just like every other woman.  His plan is to pretend that they have been called up to fight in a war. In their absence, his Albanian friends come to visit (who are really Ferrando and Guglielmo in disguise), both of whom are madly in love with Fiordiligi and Dorabella.  He gains the help of the sisters' maid, Despina, in convincing the women to have fun with these men while their fiances are away.  Dorabella is easily seduced by Guglielmo, while Fiordiligi needs strong convincing by Ferrando before she, too, gives in to his advances.  At a wedding between the women and their new lovers, the truth is revealed, and Don Alfonso asks Ferrando and Guglielmo to forgive their fiancees, for all women do that.

Great opera productions need five things: beautiful sets, great directing, excellent acting, wonderful singing, and inspired conducting.  In Cosi, one also needs an orchestra with a strong woodwind section.  While I am usually averse to period instrument performances, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, conducting by Ivan Fischer, often sounds like a modern orchestra in its phrasing.  It differs in that there is more transparency in the strings (so that you can really hear those woodwinds) and harder timpani thwacks (thanks to hard mallets, instead of soft ones).  Unfortunately, there are some occasional thin high notes in the violins and some not-quite-rounded notes in the brass, but the only time I really wished for modern instruments was during the three timpani hits that start the overture (followed by the same three timpani hits after the short theme in the woodwinds), which almost made Toscanini's recordings in Studio 8H sound resonant.  To compensate, the sublime passages (such as the sound of the breeze in ""Soave sia il vento"") and the dramatic passages (the ensemble pieces at the end of each act) are played brilliantly, with tempos well-judged.  The harpsichord also does enough to support the recitatives without calling attention to itself.

The singers are all young (except for the singer playing Don Alfonso) and are in excellent voice.  Plus, they know how to act and react, which is critical when watching an opera live or on DVD.  In fact, the camera is often as interested in their reactions as it is in capturing the person singing, and in ensembles, it will focus on one or two singers at a time, then go to a wide shot of the entire stage.  I think this adds to the experience, especially since this opera includes a lot of spying from behind the partition which cuts the stage in half and which can be opened or closed.  In front of the partition is used for the women's quarters, while the back is used for the garden, and the whole is used for larger outdoor scenes.  Simple, yet beautiful and effective, while the costumes place this opera squarely in Mozart's time, rather than trying to update it in a modern setting.

As Ferrando, Topi Lehtipuu has a beautiful tenor voice, and in his first duet with Luca Pisaroni's Guglielmo as an ""Albanian,"" he makes his mouth open and close as if he were kissing the sisters through his notes.  His reaction when he's heard that Dorabella has betrayed him is excellent, though I feel that Pisaroni is even better as a seducer and actor.  He is genuinely grieved when Dorabella falls so easily for him, and is beside himself when Ferrando finally seduces Fiordiligi (with an aria that would seduce anyone).  Both are excellent in the trio ""E voi redete,"" in which their laughter is incorporated into the music (and in such a way that it sounds as if it is oozing out at first, despite efforts to hold it back -- like a sneeze).  Nicolas Rivenq rounds out the men as Don Alfonso, who combines excellent Italian diction with a rich baritone voice and excellent acting (check out the stammer as he tries to tell the sisters that their fiances are going off to war in ""Mi par, che stamattina volentieri farei la pazzarella"").  He very much plays the part as a philosopher amused with his own cleverness, but also willing to patch things up as best he can at the end.

For the women, I will start with Despina (Ainhoa Garmendia), who doesn't overdo her impersonations of the doctor and the notary (hardly changing her voice for the former), but is full of earthy lustiness, which she portrays convincingly when telling her mistresses to have a little fun, especially in her aria ""In uomini, in soldati,"" where he ""La la la laaas"" transform into sexual come-ons, and whose advice certainly lowers Dorabella's resistance to the idea of sleeping around.  Anke Vondung makes an excellent Dorabella, particularly in her facial expressions, which show the joy she feels in having some fun with another man, and then the horrible regret she feels when her fiance returns, praising her fidelity.  As with all the other cast members, the music gives her no problems.

And now we come to Fiordiligi.  Miah Persson sings impeccably, acts impeccably, acts while singing impeccably, and makes the most of her role, in which we feel every tortured step she feels from her belief in complete faithfulness (she is able to make the runs on ""Come scoglio"" sound like shouts at the Albanians to get out of her house) to accepting that she loves another man besides her Gulglielmo.

But Cosi fan tutte is an ensemble opera, and so in the ensembles, too, the voices, characterizations, and music all blend together to not only make pretty harmonies but to serve the drama.  And this is where the directing comes in. Nicholas Hytner takes this opera seriously, his singers/actors take the opera seriously, the orchestra takes the opera seriously, and yet, this production manages to bring out all the pent-up sexual urges of its characters while simultaneously revealing the comedy and pathos.  Even better, the end of the opera is made more poignant by the fact that we know that both couples cannot completely forgive themselves for what they have done to each other.

And yet, Mozart and Da Ponte are not being pessimists about human nature.  For them, corruptibility is something innate in all humans, not just women.  To have it proven to us is horrible, which is why we should accept this fact without asking for proof and forgive others for being as imperfect as us. ""Lucky [are] those who see the good in everything and in every event are guided by reason,"" as the ensemble sings at the end of the opera.  In this Glyndebourne production, that message comes through, and shows us that one of Mozart's most troubled operas is actually one of his deepest.

P.S. I can only imagine what the Blu-ray sounds like, as the DVD sound quality is excellent, and gives the option for stereo or DTS surround sound.  There are also multiple subtitle options (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, or none) and a few extras on the first DVD with the conductor, director, and cast talking about the opera and about this particular production.",1394150400,7,7543,4.798299845440495
2769278,5,B000NIWI9K,"This is a masterpiece!

The story is both hilarious and clever. The music by Mozart is among the greatest ever written and so perfectly matches the acting.

This production on Blu-ray is a masterpiece and the standard by which other opera DVDs should be judged.

If you are new to opera, definitely watch this. It will shatter any bad myths you have about opera. It is so entertaining for anyone.

Refer to the other reviews for the specifics as to why it is so great. My only criticism is that Anke Vondung seems to frown in her eyes too often but sings wonderfully and great overall.

Fantastic singing and acting by Miah Persson, Luca Pisaroni, Topi Lehtipuu, Anke Vondung, Nicolas Rivenq and Ainhoa Garmendia. Persson is young and gorgeous. Terrific performance by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (on period instruments and one of my all-time favorite orchestras worldwide) and hilarious story.

By the way, this opera should only be performed with YOUNG actors for the four main parts, especially the two women and especially Dorabella (looking like an older teenager ideally) or the story does not make sense. The title should be translated as ""Girls Are Like That."" Da Ponte poked fun at men characters in his other two masterpiece Mozart operas, and now he pokes fun at young women.",1386374400,3,1300,4.833333333333333
2769279,4,B000NIWI9K,"I think this 2006 performance is slightly overrated by two reasons -
1.  Lovely setting, beautiful staging;
2.  Terrific direction and acting;
3.  Ultra-lovely protagonists.
However, there is a big however, the
SINGING level is a bit mediocre if compared to the two Muti sets (1982, 1994) with protagonists Murray/Marshall/Araiza/Morris/Bruscantini/Battle and Schade/Skovhus/Kichschlager/Frittoli/Corbeli/Bacelli.
Of the six protagonists, Pisaroni is a visually delux (tall, young, handsome, charismatic) and vocally adequate Gugliemo.  Nicolas Rivenq is a veteran Mozartian and delivers the most stylish singing, but his acting is merely adequate.  Topi Lehtipuu is an almost great Ferrando - beautiful voice, good acting, marvellous singing, only slightly not as stylish as a Mozartian as the likes of Schreier, Araiza, Schade. Very satisfying Ferrando. Miah Persson is a beautiful Fiordiligi, vocally still in her prime, the voice hasn't hardened in 2006 here. Ainhoa Garmendia is an effective Despina, but no rival with Kathleen Battle for Muti in 1982, really. The main draw here is Anke Vondung's Dorabella, for though visually superb, is vocally clearly sub par with the rest of the cast. Indeed, has severe pitch problem coupling with inadequate projection in Dorabella's solo aria.  Her acting however is wonderful and works well in ensembles.
Very enjoyable modern Cosi, especially for the guys'roles.",1376179200,3,1411,5.759615384615385

2769284,5,B000NIWI9K,"It should be mentioned that although this is a conventional (and visually beautiful) production, it isn't so
conventional as an interpretation of the opera.  The opera supports many interpretations, but this one is a little different.

Strangely enough this is Cosi Fan Tutte as a love story--Fiordiligi finds her Albanian suitor as the true love of her life.

Sex and love are obviously central to the opera, but what is different in this production is the focus on the sexual awakening of the women as a central theme.  While the first act demonstrates that the four principals have much to lose with Don Alphonso's trials, the second act treats the seduction as a kind of triumph of the women's sexual development--regardless of what provoked it.  Fiordiligi's final seduction scene is a climactic love scene, and at the end of the opera she is reluctant to give up her chosen partner.

With such emphasis on the sexual nature of the relationships, no reconciliation is imaginable at the end.  (In this production the locket is the least of it.)  So the final scene is grim--the men can't see where to go, and the women are nowhere and in love with something that doesn't exist.

It has to be said that the music does work for this interpretation--which is wonderfully sung and acted--but it sure makes
for heady stuff.

For the sake of argument it is worth saying a few words about the composer's intent in this opera, because that much is actually pretty clear.

- Most fundamentally this is a ""patient Griselda"" story turned upside down.  While it is in the format of old stories about wives undergoing abuse to test their faithfulness, in this case the women fail the test but the test itself is an act of treachery so complete as to eclipse what they have done. The whole affair seems strangely modern in the casualness of the evil.

- Whether it is problematical in this opera or not, reconciliation is a primary theme of Mozart operas, so it has to be taken seriously.  That means the intent of the action is to push to the boundary of what is forgivable but not over, and the characters are left shaken but at least willing to go on with the rest of their lives.  From a musical point of view, the beautiful ensemble that precedes the final chorus (abbreviated here) is certainly to be taken seriously.

- Finally the opera is about sex and love without being either amoral or prudish in its conclusion.  The women are overwhelmed by what hits them and are so unprepared for it that they can only call for the maid when it starts.  They have been through a kind of parallel universe that they have to reconcile with reality.  Musically the key changes mark how far they have gone and come back.",1345939200,20,2705,4.633123689727463
2769285,5,B000NIWI9K,"This production of Cosi fan tutte was recorded at Glyndebourne in 2006 which was the first year of this production's staging there. The production by Nicholas Hytner is totally traditional in feel and this will come as a great relief to those who despair of the tendency of modern opera producers to feel the need to focus on their own inspiration rather than that of the plot and music. At no discernible point is either the plot or Mozart's inspiration compromised here. The period established in the production is completely reasonable as are the sets and costumes even though it is probably a little later than originally conceived. The conclusion of the opera brings an interesting twist which may warn us that playing with emotions may lead to unforeseen consequences.

The period feel of the production is underpinned by the use of the aptly named Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with their leader being appropriately named as Margaret Faultless. This choice of `authentic period' orchestra leads to much improved orchestral balance and timbres and, in the hands of conductor Ivan Fischer, a bitingly exciting delivery of the music, both instrumental and vocal. Although there will be those who will maintain that there is no actual way of being sure that this is what Mozart would have heard, in my opinion, the proof is in the listening and in this case the case for such an orchestra is made clearly enough.

The cast is, without doubt, uniformly excellent and rise wonderfully well to the challenges of live performance in the context of the likely `authentic' sounds produced by the orchestra. The tempi are challengingly fast at times but never breathless and there is always time made for sensitivity, proper phrasing and moments of doubt and reflection.

The two girls are perfectly cast with Miah Persson and Anke Vondung being a suitably lively and attractive pair of young women. Both obviously relish their respective roles as Fiordiligi and Dorabella and also each other's stage company and there is a good deal of naturally spontaneous-sounding humour provided for the audience to enjoy. This same free-wheeling behaviour is both encouraged and shared as directed in the plot by the excellent Despina performed by Ainhoa Garmendia. All three women are fully on top of the technical and musical demands of their roles and this enables them to `play' together.

The three men are well up to this standard too with Ferrando and Guglielmo delivering multi-nuanced performances as appropriate along with their `friend' Don Alfonso. These roles are delivered with great flair by Topi Lehtipuu, Luca Pisaroni and Nicholas Rivenq respectively. As a group of six they seem to make a perfect combination and are certainly the best I have ever had the privilege to watch.

There are short bonus items in the form of an illustrated synopsis and interviews with the conductor and producer as well as with some of the cast. There is also an animated cast gallery.

The recording is particularly clear visually and gives great clarity and detail while still delivering on colour definition. The sound is equally fine with clearly defined detail both on stage and in the orchestra and with good balance. It is presented in both DTS 5.1 and stereo options.

This is an exhilarating production and performance likely to give enormous pleasure upon repeat viewing. In my opinion this is one of the best Mozart discs I have yet to see or own and I have enjoyed it as such every time I have seen it in the years since I bought it. I am sure most future purchasers will have much the same responses and therefore a 5 star assessment seems completely appropriate.

In summary therefore, I would suggest that this disc should warrant serious consideration from any potential purchaser.",1343520000,3,3788,4.9637223974763405

The staging is just as it should be:  fluid, detailed, coherent, and engaging.  (I don't often find myself saying that!)

2769287,4,B000NIWI9K,"1st, this is a good Opera.  Fun to watch.  2 things strike me as missing.  The set is very modern and at times, only a blue screen background.  Aweful.  The worst part was the audio production/orchestration.  If you have a nice sound system and like to ""crank up"" your classical and Opera's.  This will shock you.  It sounds like the orchestra was surrounded by sound absorbing material with no ambiance or tone.  I was shocked at how bad it sounded.  It was played correctly, but lacked any sense of being in a concert hall.  FLAT.

The singers and acting were great.  The English Subs were ok, but at times they went too long without any subs, leaving a viewer wondering what they are singing about.

Since this is the only recent production, I purchased it, but it has no replay value, because of the Orchestra and Production Set.  It's a big turn off.

BTW, the Overture is bad (don't you think?).  It doesn't sound like anything Mozart would have composed.  In fact, it is the most unappealing composition in the opera.

2769290,5,B000NIWI9K,"The main attraction of this performance of Cosi fan tutte is not so much the vocal performance as the theatrical performance.  The interpretation of the music is fairly conventional and likely to please most people, but I would have preferred singers with a bit more vocal heft to really make the music shine.  However, the singers pull off very emotionally-convincing portrayals of their characters, and so the overall experience is very satisfactory.  Though this is not perhaps my ideal Cosi staging, this DVD is definitely worth buying.  If you are not yet familiar with this opera, this is probably one of the best productions to view, as the staging is never pretentious, nor does it interfere with the emotional impact of the music, and the sound quality is quite good, making it probably the most approachable interpretation of this work available on DVD so far.",1310256000,3,870,4.979310344827586

Naturally, this event takes place at Glyndebourne opera house, founded I believe by the Christies. The wife sang opera, Mozart was  her favourite. The singers Miah Persson,Fiordilgi. Dorabella, Anke Vondung. Don Alfonso, Nicolas Rivenq, and the rest of the cast sing extremely well. Beautiful opera. Certainly, should be in your collection.

2769292,5,B000NIWI9K,"What has been stated below is for the DVD of this work that I bought before I upgraded and bought a Blu ray...
Here goes:
I have been familiar with Cosi ever since I can remember. From an aria or two on my dad's 78RPM records to the beautiful Otto Klemperer recording on vinyl and later on to many VHS tapes and then the Gardiner version, although good, started appearing a little jaded thanks to average acting and dramatization.
So when I felt I should have a fresh new production, (sans Eurotrash), I thought I would look up the views of the reviewing proletariat - and thought I would risk buying this one.
THANKS GUYS.... Whatever you have stated in all the previous 10 reviews (for the DVD) to this is almost absolutely correct. This is the nearest thing that is akin to an un-putdownable book that I have seen. So fresh, vibrant in acting and absolutely precise sublime singing and interpretation. I think I will measure any other Cosi by the standard of this one.
Not just period costumes, but sets that are minimal, but bright and not jungle-jims or abstract pillars and stuff that do not distract, but bring out the essence of the interpretation. I am also overjoyed that it has been performed by artistes thus far not known to me... maybe they are doing well these days, must look that up now.
Just that I do not agree with one reviewer (for the DVD) who stated that the third set of Despina and the Don are not up to the mark.. Yes. Despina here is no Lucia Popp but is quite adequate for the role, and if Don had been more powerful, may have killed the character. I think he is just right for the role too...
I would unhesitatingly recommend this Blu Ray or DVD  to anyone irrespective of whether it is the first ever video of Cosi or even if one has all the other recordings of it.",1302739200,2,1795,4.374251497005988

2769294,5,B000NIWI9K,"If one were to see only one opera, many would argue that the opera should be Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte (All Women Behave Like This).  In Cosi, both Mozart's music and the libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte are unsurpassed. Collaborating on Cosi both men in 1790 were at the height of their professional careers. The opera was the last of three opera buffa (comic operas) that the two men completed during a three year period. Considered salacious, Cosi became an immediate hit.

Going beyond the technical brilliance, the opera has a moral. In fact, the conductor of the orchestra, Ivan Fischer, in the Glyndebourne production, talking about the opera, mentions that seeing the opera saved his parents' marriage. The excellent Glydebourne production was put on in 2006 in Sussex England with imported Italian singers.

The story begins in a bar where two young noblemen are bragging one-to-another about their fiancs and how their women love only them. A man with greying hair, Don Alfonso, unable to stand any more of their talk, interrupts them to say that they are young and naive. Initially, the two young men challenge Don Alfonso to fight, but Alfonso dismisses their challenge as foolish bravado. Over drinks Don Alfonso explains that it is likely their fiancs would forget them in as little as 24 hours, and bed other men. The two young men are incredulous, demanding that Alfonso back up his statement by making a sizable bet. As one would expect, Don Alfonso wins the bet.

In the seduction scene, Fiordiligi's handsome suitor sings to her a gorgeous aria. The female cast sympathizes with the young woman saying: ""Who wouldn't be seduced by such beautiful music?""",1294099200,,1666,4.918149466192171

From the first bars of the overture, you know you are in for a treat.  The music is played with energy and enthusiasm.  The two finales truly shake the house.  Fischer and Hytner also have a few interesting things to say about the opera in the bonus interviews.  The ending is ambiguous - as Hytner claims, every audience has to decide itself whether all's well or not by the end.

Not much more to add. It's a treasure.",1287964800,,568,4.466019417475728

2769299,5,B000NIWI9K,"Another outstanding Blu Ray Mozart opera production. Thankfully traditional costuming and sets, but acted and sung with skill and relish to the delight of the audience and this viewer. The three leading ladies are particularly good and their comic acting is very amusing. One wonders just what the young Mozart observed about the behaviour of the aristocracy in his travels because his operas reflect obvious disrespect for them, something which caused considerable uproar when they were first produced. In this opera he credits the maid, Despina, deliciously sung and acted by Ainhoa Garmendia, with more intelligence and astuteness to see through the disguises of the men, than the ladies who are supposed to love them!!

As with most operas the storyline is thin and unbelievable but the artists in this Glynedebourne effort imbue the production with such delightful singing and acting one soon forgets the total improbability of what is happening and become completely immersed in it. This is the BD Mozart opera I have enjoyed the most out of a generally good lot.

The audio and video are up to the usual high Blu Ray standards. We are fortunate to have been given so many top notch Mozart operas in this format. Unreservedly recommended.",1273190400,7,1244,5.0634146341463415

I am a singer, conductor, and musicologist, and I have been involved with workshop and professional productions of Cosi since I was an undergraduate. I think I could probably sing it in my sleep. But I have never seen or heard such a beautiful, fully realized production as this one. Indeed, in these days of Regietheater etc. I hardly thought it possible. It is so obvious that the people involved, besides being highly skilled, take Mozart and Da Ponte seriously, even (especially) in what is sometimes considered their silliest comic opera.

The television direction and the Blu-Ray encoding, both picture and sound, are astonishing as well. (Sorry, I realize that if I keep up this gushing, I'll lose credibility. Just can't help it.)

2769301,3,B000NIWI9K,"On the plus side beautifully sung and acted throughout by the four lovers especially the superlative Miah Persson, and fine orchestral work at least after a very blatant overpowering heavy-handed Act One overture, yet so much on the minus side too:  a non-starter as Don Alfonso (this wasn't a philosopher but a petulant angry man with no explanation as to why) and despite her attractive demeanor a weak Despina who made nothing of her extra roles either as the Doctor or the Notary;  inadequate staging with so much action stuck behind furniture and a totally bland handling of the chorus (no sense of who, what, or why with lumpen characterless mass entrances and exits);  poor costume choices for Don Alfonso, Despina and Dorabella, and why does Despina as a maid have almost exactly the same hairstyle as her two mistresses?;  however my biggest quarrel is with the dreadful camerawork, most unusual for a production from Glyndebourne - it seems that the director had no idea of what was coming next, often missing a singer's key vocal line by focussing on the wrong person at the wrong time and regularly failing to include all the singers when a quartet or sextet was being sung

for the four lovers alone it is worth watching once but it won't find a place in my collection - for my money the Ponnelle/Harnoncourt film or the Peter Sellars ""diner"" production offer so much more visually and as a whole:  a great shame, the handsome talented lovers deserved so much more",1263513600,22,1477,4.772549019607843

She is the star of the show; she is beautiful to behold, acts superbly and is a terrific singer. What a package!

The orchestral playing (on period instrument) under the direction of Ivan Fisher is lively, sparkling and true to the spirit of Mozart. Added to this is the good sound and filming.

2769305,5,B000NIWI9K,"Last of the three Mozart-Da Ponte operas, Cosi Fan Tutte (They all do it) premiered in January 1790. Mozart was in despondent spirits during the two dark years of 1789-90. His own health was poor, his wife Constanze was also frequently ill, and money was scarce as a result of a war induced economic depression in Austria. It was during this period - in which his frequent begging letters to fellow Mason Michael Puchberg reveal his increasing desperation - that Mozart was least productive in an otherwise uncanny lifetime of stunning productivity. Mozart's operas were only moderately successful in Vienna. The Viennese audiences were notoriously conservative and found his music too difficult for their ears (""too many notes"" as Emperor Joseph said of The Abduction from the Seraglio). Mozart had spectacular success in Prague, however, as the composition of Don Giovanni to be premiered in that city in 1787 proves. Despite the difficulties Mozart faced in its composition, Cosi is perhaps his most perfect opera. It contains some of the most ravishingly beautiful music he ever composed in what is essentially a chamber opera for six voices.

This production is an ostentatiously traditional one. It seems to ""flip-the-bird"" at all new-fangled updatings and it proudly proclaims its stubborn adherence to 18th Century performance values. As a result it is hypermodern and ultimately subversive. The message of this Cosi is clear: see how wonderfully effective a traditional Mozart performance truly is. Why waste your time on modernizations? From the sets and stage design to costumes and performances everything suggests the period in which the opera was written. This Glyndebourne production directed by Nicholas Hytner is as much a feast for the eyes as the musical performances are a sumptuous repast for the ears. All of the vocal performers are superb (and superb looking) and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment conducted by Ivan Fischer performs this music on authentic instruments in an historically informed performance that is exemplary.

Filmed in high-definition, this single BD50 Opus Arte Blu-Ray disc produces a  deeply colorful 16:9 1080i image and pristine audio in both Dolby TrueHD 2.0 and 5.0 soundtracks. Because of the extreme visual and audio clarity provided by the Blu-Ray format the experience is utterly immersive. One feels as if the stage is in the room producing a palpable sense of a live performance. The running time of the disc is 210 minutes.

This is an experience not to be missed. If your equipment is capable of reproducing the full high-definition output of a Blu-Ray disc then this performance of Cosi Fan Tutte belongs in your collection. Superbly performed and presented it is most assuredly a special release.

2769306,5,B000NIWI9K,"This DVD is my favorite  ""Cos"" from now on, and my old Harnoncourt-Bartoli-Baltsa-Zurich set has become my ""other"" one. Why is this? Are the singers, or the orchestra, or the conductor much better in the new version? No, I can't say that. Though she's a wonderful singer, beautiful Miah Persson can't deliver the demoniac ""Come scoglio"" as Cecilia Bartoli masterly does (who can?). And Topi Lehtipuu is not vocally superior to the ardent, italian lyric tenor of Roberto Sacca, and conductor Ivan Fisher does not a clearly better job than Maestro Harnoncourt, and so on, but...

But perfect music rendering is not everything in an opera DVD, and this Glyndebourne ""Cosi"" has an evident advantage over the Zurich set: visual offering. And I don't mean just the static scenery, but the dramatic flow also. Sets, costumes and lighting tell us that young ladies Fiordiligi and Dorabella live under the blue skies of Ferrara, in a nice house with a nice garden, and plenty of flowers. By some strange reason, these were forbidden issues at the Zurich stage (?). And, perhaps the main strenght of this Glyndenbourne DVD (over many others, not only the Zurich's) is Stage Director Nicholas Hytner, who does a magnificent job with his young singing-artists, driving the plot much closer to the standard of a good stage play than that of an opera.

So I'm joining most other reviewers and  I strongly recommend this DVD, as one of the best filmed and well balanced (music and drama) opera productions on the market.",1247184000,11,1505,4.890196078431373
