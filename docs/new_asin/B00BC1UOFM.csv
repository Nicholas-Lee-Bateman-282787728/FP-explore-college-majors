8565674,2,B00BC1UOFM,"I am absolutely shocked at this presentation.  Not just the material, but the POOR VIDEO & AUDIO QUALITY!  A third grade student with a $39 camera phone could have produced a better resolution and audio than this DVD.  Blurry to the point of being extremely discomforting to try to watch.  Audio is so muffled - it is almost unable to detect the words being said. From what I can tell, it is a 3 hour lecture by Mr. Ian Crane, taken from 2006 & 2007, (during the BUSH era).  The audio does get better by the 3rd hour of his lecture.  Save yourself the money - and listen to his most recent lectures for free on You Tube!!

Pretend you are sitting in the back row of an auditorium taping a professor's class with a $39.00 cell phone.  Now do it for 3 straight hours!  That is all that is on this video.  In this modern age of You Tube and millions of videos on the internet, this is very disappointing.  I would be embarrassed to be the producer of this DVD.  By the way, not one word is spoken about controlling your mind.  Just general ramblings on various world figures and events.  There are some good points made in the DVD, but not what I expected at all.

Although Mr. Crane is a brilliant speaker, analyst and researcher, they could have used a more current lecture, (say from 2010-2013) and actually used professional recording equipment.  If the video had decent quality I would give it 3 stars on Mr. Crane's reputation alone, even though it is from 2006-2007.  The misleading DVD cover is ridiculous!  They should have disclosed that the entire DVD is a taping of a 2006-2007 lecture.  By the way, Mr. Crane is a brilliant man, but anti-Christian and anti-Bible oriented. I am a born again Christian, however, I am interested in the quality of the materials and not the qualifications of the speaker, thus his religious beliefs or lack thereof were not an issue.",1368835200,4,1873,4.488165680473373
