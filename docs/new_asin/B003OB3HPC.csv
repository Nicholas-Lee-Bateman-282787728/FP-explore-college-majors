8401538,5,B003OB3HPC,Nice trip down memory lane.  This DVD is educational and informative for all ages.  Dr. Frank Baxter was and STILL is 'the best' in his presentation.  He makes learning about science a fun experience.,1383696000,,200,4.823529411764706
8401539,3,B003OB3HPC,"Love Our Mr. Sun and did have the Image dvd release and decided to buy this one hoping that a better print of the film was made..WRONG!  This dvd has a very weak colors, print damage and poor sound. Avoid this release and buy the Our Mr. Sun / Strange Case Of The Cosmic Rays dvd release which Amazon still sells.",1304640000,,313,4.131147540983607
8401540,5,B003OB3HPC,"I remember seeing some of the Bell Science Series in elementary school. I never thought I'ld see them again. Our Mister Sun is a great one. Still very informative and Dr Frank Baxter makes it fun. A young Eddie Albert plays his sidekick this time instead of Richard Carlson. The added science shorts were entertaining, just like so many movies we were shown in school back ini the day.",1290038400,3,385,4.594202898550725
8401541,5,B003OB3HPC,"Our Mr. Sun is one of the best in the legendary Bell Science Series of the 1950s and early 1960s. It's about on equal footing with Hemo The Magnificent, another uber jem made by Frank Capra, the famous director. Dr. Frank Baxter is in usual wonderful for as the avuncular and charming host of this science special about the Sun. And yes, that is the voice of Lionel Barrymore as Father Time. For some reason, the Internet Movie Database states that Lionel Barrymore is uncredited and unconfirmed. Well, they must not have been paying any attention to the opening credits, because Mr Barrymores's name is featured prominently. And since this is a Frank Capra piece, a man who worked with Lionel Barrymore for the Christmas classic, It's a Wonderful Life, I'm certain there can be no doubt. True, Mr. Barrymore had already passed on by the time of Our Mr. Sun's release, but animation was much more time consuming then; it probably took that long to finish the project.
  Anyway, if you never saw this special, you must. It has been seen countless times in Baby Boomer elementary school classrooms, and has inspired many to go into science. It, of course, deals with the sun, with the help of animation, and talks about energy,sun spots, the sun's origin, etc..But it's done with a humanist, entertaining flare that has never been duplicated outside this marvelous series.
  Also on the DVD are some science shorts that will have you feel like your back in the 6th grade. A is For Atom is particularly good. It's animated and features Anthropomorphic atoms dancing and the like to demonstrate natural and artificial decay and fission. Way Stations In Space is a product of the space race, showing us a Jetson's like future where space stations exist. Fun Stuff!",1275004800,2,1759,4.795379537953796
