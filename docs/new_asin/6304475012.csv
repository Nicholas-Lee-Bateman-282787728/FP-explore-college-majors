8070859,5,6304475012,"I treasure this tape for teaching Religious Ed.  It has a number of short documentary-type short stories on miracles as told by the people who experienced them.  They are spell-binding stories, and the pace is fast enough to keep the interest of junior high through adult.  God's love shows through with recalling the stories, how we are protected and loved in our everyday lives and at the most challenging times in our lives.  Sure wish it was made in a DVD format.",1484352000,,467,4.658536585365853

It always stuck with me because I was having a lousy Holiday; I had the flu and this program made my Christmas very special.  For example: there is a minister that lost his voice, it's only barley audible as he teaches Sunday school (and one can hear the actual recording of that class and experience the miracle as it happened)!  There are many more and several have been verified as true happenings.  This is a great program that will lift your soul, body, and spirit to higher ground!  I only wish it was on DVD.",1309392000,,591,4.345454545454546
8070861,5,6304475012,This is the greatest witness of true life miracles I have ever seen. Miracles are real today just like in the time of Jesus. You will be amazed and rejoice as you see these miracles told by real life miracles. 1. woman loses wedding ring in yard with leaves everywhere. Woman next door sees neighbor concerned about something Goes next door finds out she lost wedding ring in racked leaves. She says lets pray. they both get on there knees and pray for god to help them find it. The woman next door gets up walks through the yard comes to a pile of leaves reaches down into a big pile of leaves and pulls out her wedding rings unbeliveable. 2. Missionarys in Mexico have a holiday feast for only 150 people expected to show up. These mexicans live in eyesight of Americas border and survive by eating leftover food in the garbage dump. About 450 showed up instead of the 150 they made food for. They had some bread and one big ham. They knew there was no way they were going to feed that many people with one ham. They started serving the ham with people showing off having a big slice of ham. They knew after feeding the 450 people with one ham multipying they just witnessed a miracle. They even had ham leftover to take back to the orphanage to feed the orphans. glory to God. Thats just two of about ten awesome miracles god performed. This is one of my most treasured christain videos. If your a Pastor or Minister seeking a gift of miracles like me this is a great place to start.,1295481600,,1486,4.329749103942652
