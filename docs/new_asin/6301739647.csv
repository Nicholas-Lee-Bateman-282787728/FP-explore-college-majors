369331,3,6301739647,"This movie gets off to a slow start, taking a lengthy sideroad to showcase young Anna Maria Alberghetti's singing chops.  While she definitely shines in her big debut, the scene has absolutely nothing to do with the movie and should have been left out.  Some further 'tightening up' would have helped, too--leaving about 20 minutes of this movie on the cutting room floor would have elevated its status as a Capra movie.
Even so, it's not a flop by any means.  Franchot Tone almost steals the show with his affable, aplomb portrayal as Wilbur Stanley, and Alexis Smith makes a hilarious transformation from dour, pent-up 'kissing cousin' to vampy seductress.  And, even though neither Bing Crosby nor Jane Wyman can call this the best film in their oeuvre, they deliver solid performances and fans of either will find this an enjoyable movie.",1447372800,,842,4.908450704225352

369494,4,6301739647,"Bing Crosby was always won't to take on roles of men who always had an angle. And ain't no different with 1951's Here Comes the Groom, one of Frank Capra's less touted if still very amiable motion pictures. Bing is Peter Garvey, foreign correspondent for the Boston Express and assigned to Paris to do pieces on war orphans. And in the City of Light, he's gotten particularly close to Bobby and Suzie, two inseparable child refugees who dote on him.

What gives the plot its kick in the pants is a Dear John letter from Pete's ex-fiance by way of phonograph record. Emmadel Jones (Jane Wyman) apparently has had enough of carrying a torch for Pete and she gives him the brush off. She laments that they could've had a child in 5th grade by now, and etcetera. In Paris Pete is galvanized into frenetic activity. He adopts Bobby (a 5th grader) and Suzie (the etc.) and off they fly to the States, just in time to be almost too late.

Emmadel's impending nuptials to prominent broker Wilbur Stanley (Franchot Tone) has made front page news, what with the Stanleys forming one of the blueblood families of Boston. Of Wilbur, Pa Jones, Emmie's dad, scoffs: ""He's not even a man. He's a tradition."" But, yeah, Emmie, salt-of-the-earth mackerel man's daughter, is marrying into $40 million - not that Pete's tripping about that. Pete's always been a cocky sort. But maybe he's relying too much on his and Em's past as childhood sweethearts. He thinks he can break up the wedding, thinks he can trump what the toff's got to offer. He's looking for a burr to place under Emmie to make her rethink things. He's got five days to it, he's got 'til Saturday, after which time the permit that allows the kids to stay will be revoked. And if Pete himself doesn't get married, then the kids get taken from him.

Here Comes the Groom has got a lot going for it. Foremost is Bing Crosby who is so laid back the back of his head touches the floor. Bing's trademark crooning is on full display, as is his smooth jibber jabber. But he's not the only bullet in the chamber. He's got that terrific give and take with Jane Wyman. I enjoyed Anna Maria Alberghetti's early cameo as a blind orphan who beautifully sings ""Caro Nome"" from Verdi's Rigoletto. I was so hoping she'd show up later in the movie. Speaking of songs, the Bingster serenades dames and brats and other folks with some songs memorable and songs that aren't so memorable. Two numbers that should really strike a chord are the nifty airplane song ""Misto Cristofo Columbo"" (in which Bing is backed up by a cameoing Louis Armstrong, Dorothy L'Amour, Phil Harris and a few more I don't recognize) and the Oscar-winning Johnny Mercer/Hoagy Carmichael colab ""In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening"" (a ditty that gets sung and hummed throughout the film by just about everyone in the cast, including Jane Wyman).

And it's a super-solid supporting cast, with three standouts for me. Connie Gilchrist as ""Ma Jones"" isn't in much but she makes her few scenes work. It's not that she harbors hate for our guy Pete. It's that she visualizes a grand life for her daughter. So she's on high alert for Pete's silver tongue possibly sabotaging the wedding. As the film goes on, her muttered words of caution to Em indicate the progress of Pete's plan: She says, ""Watch yourself, Emmie."" and then ""No, Emmie, don't do it!"" and, finally, defeatedly, ""Oh, well... can't win."" She's funny.

I appreciate that Franchot Tone, who plays Pete's romantic rival, is drawn as a sympathetic character. Yep, Wilbur Stanley has got superior breeding, has got loads more money, is a better wrestler, golfer, sailor, is younger, and his cigarette lighter actually lights. But he's a swell, level-headed gent that you just can't hate on. When Wilbur and Pete lay the cards on the table and even make a gentleman's wager, it's cool that Wilbur doesn't resort to nasty tricks. In fact, if anyone resorts to nasty tricks...

But the most unexpected wonderful surprise for me was Alexis Smith's marvelous turn as Wilbur's dour, decorous cousin Winifred Stanley, she whom Pete sculpts from a stiff hoity toit into an awesome undulating vamp. Cousin Winifred, who becomes very likeable, is crucial to Pete's scheme. It's a neat reverse-Pygmalion maneuver that may (or may not) shift the tides of fate. Good luck, Pete. Good luck, Emmie. But, also, good luck, Wilbur. And can everyone stop singing that song? I just got over incessantly humming another song at work (damn you, Frozen's ""Let It Go"").",1402444800,,4504,4.723918575063613
369495,2,6301739647,"An interesting storyline, but this is certainly not one of Bing Crosby's better performances ... nor was it one of Jane Wyman's better performances either.  The singing is too staged to fit with the storyline.  Definitely a forgettable Frank Capra film.",1398816000,,253,5.146341463414634
369496,3,6301739647,"A pleasant film with the leads, Bing Crosby and Jane Wyman doing a wonderful job -- they are very likable performers.  The second leads -- Franchot Tone and Alexis Smith also provide entertaining support.  But it is a minor film as compared to the other Frank Capra movies, such as Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It Happened One Night, You Can't Take It With You and It's a Wonderful Life.  And I can't get the song ""In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening"" out of my brain -- such a catchy tune.",1396828800,,518,4.26530612244898

369571,3,6301739647,"This is Frank Capra's only musical.  The music is very good (Hoagy Carmichael's, ""In The Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,"" which won an Oscar).  In the 1950's, someone suggested that Crosby give up film and become a priest, so altruistic were his portrayals.  Here is a case for it, but made with too many cliches.  Jane Wyman practically knocks the other players off the screen (and once, literally).  Franchot Tone's acting is amiable and calming.  The proceedings are bracketed by an improbable musical number on an airplane (!)at the beginning and a surprise fight at the end.  Why not watch it once?",1376092800,,604,4.805825242718447

369574,1,6301739647,"When folks discuss the great films of Frank Capra, this film seldom seems to come up... and there's a reason!  This was a pretty terrible film, one of Bing Crosby's least charming outings, and certainly a low point for Capra.  The script is atrocious, the realization is shoddy and abrupt, and the film's end may make you feel a little queasy.  Here's the plot: Bing is a foreign correspondent, off in postwar Europe, writing heartwarming stories about French war orphans.  His editor wants something juicier, and his jilted American fiancee does, too.  So, Bing has to come back to the States with, naturally, a couple of toussle-haired raggamuffins in tow and a song in his heart.  Alas!  He is too late: his sweetie (played by a remarkably shrill Jane Wyman) has dumped him in favor of her millionaire boss, amiably portrayed by Franchot Tone.  In fact, it's Franchot Tone, easily outshining Crosby, who gives this ricketty film its one glimmer of class... A long scene between him and Bing, when they size each other up, is the single redeeming sequence... Everything else is rough, slipshod and frantic, including Capra's directorial work, particularly the editing.  Bing does his best to be cool and hip, but his schtick just isn't working this time around... Mostly it's the film's fault; this is an amazingly substandard production... It's worth skipping, even if you're a big Bing Crosby fan.",1094342400,3,1401,4.952991452991453
