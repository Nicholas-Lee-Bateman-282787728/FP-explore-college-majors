8431747,5,B004J72OQS,"This documentary is of course made for the Roman Church and has commentary in it that does not match actual History.  I do recommend this DVD to anyone who has a History back ground and knows when Romanism making its own commentary  in much the same way a does the Baptist and Church of Campbell makes up there own church history.  On line, a good resource for the teaching of history.  It covers information that is not generally in the history books of local government schools or college text.  I am glad to have viewed this DVD and do recommend to people who already have a history and church back ground.  The warning I am speaking about is the decision of the Council of 326 was approved and agreed to by the Emperor.  The Roman Pope who did not attend the Council. The Pope  got his copy with instruction from the Emperor that it was the word of the Empire.  The Roman Pope could not and was not going to try and over ride the Emperor or the Council.  So the Roman Pope did not have to approve of it.  It was handed to him without request.  Approval of the Rome Pope was only a matter of his choice for personal ceremony.  The Emperor had given the Roman Pope the order of the Empire.  Just know that Roman commentary is not History and that pass the commentary this is a  real good study history.  There is other commentary is this DVD.  Recommend to buy this DVD",1393372800,,1371,4.29296875
8431748,4,B004J72OQS,"I bought this series of nine half-hour documentary episodes on Early Christianity hoping for an informative, narrative-driven educational experience. It's good, but not great. The DVD clamshell contains two discs with the nine episodes, most of them on the first disc. Ignatius Press is releasing this series in the United States, but it's produced by Spain-based Goya Producciones, with both Spanish and English languages available on the soundtrack. The English track is actually pretty good, with the English narration done well and the English dubbing over the Spanish-language interviews done in a clear and non-intrusive way. The only problem with this series is that's a bit disjointed and dull. The episodes are arranged topically rather than in a linear historical fashion, which means the first episode takes you all the way from the apostles (1st century) to Diocletian (4rd century) without stopping for a breather. The narrative transitions are therefore a bit choppy at times. Then you get entire episodes (like the one on St. Augustine) set in a much briefer time period, making the series feel a bit uneven and scattered. The content and scholarship is excellent, but the recreations are a bit low-budget (no A&E or History Channel quality here) and the pace a bit pedestrian. Fortunately, each episode is only 30 minutes even when it drags, making the series tolerable at worst and insightful at best. I do recommend it for any adult who wants to learn about the struggles and emergence of Christianity out of Rome's shadow, but it's not the most compelling viewing experience. Kids will be bored by it, but it might be a good show for an adult religious education class. There is some pretty good location footage and historical context that the filmmakers collect here, making it a pretty impressive synthesis of historical information and sources.",1389052800,5,1867,5.144736842105263
8431749,5,B004J72OQS,"I developed a better understanding of  Early Christians and how our faith was bridged/passed on to our present times.

It touches on the Fathers of the Church and Martyrs in the Colosseum.,1368403200,2,254,5.195121951219512
8431751,5,B004J72OQS,"This helped me see the early christians as people, not ""characters"". I'm humbled and challenged by their experiences. Would recommend this to anyone trying to get a better picture of how they lived",1349222400,7,197,5.0
8431752,5,B004J72OQS,"This is one of the best documentaries on early Christianity that I have ever seen. It is divided into 9 episodes of 30 minutes each, ensuring that there is no information overload! Produced by a Spanish company, Goya Producciones, this documentary is very interesting and features wonderful locations, excellent interviews with an array of international academics from renowned universities both secular and religious, who put forth a very balanced view on the beginings of Christianity as well as abbots, most notably of the Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos (of the Gregorian Chants fame).

As mentioned above the 9 episodes are as follows:
1) The Scandal of the cross - examines the perplexity the ancient Romans faced in trying to understand the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the belief the first Christians had in Him.

2) The Empire's Conversion - What, finally, did win the Romans over? This episode discusses this.

3) Persecution and Defense - The martyrdom of the early Christians is examined here.

4) The theater of heresy - Talks about the various heresies prevalent in the early days such as Arianism, Gnosticism, etc.

5) Constantine and the end of persecutions _ The history, character ,conversion, actions and motivations of this emperor is dissected in this episode.

6) Saint Augustine a light in the darkness - The story of the lives of Saints Monica and Augustine and his contribution to the church.

7) Monks, Virgins and Hermits - How did monasticism begin? Why were there monks and nuns? How were they organized?  Who came up with the rules that govern their communities? All theses questions and many others are answered here.

8) Baptizing the Barbarians - The threat posed by the Vandals, Huns and Visigoths. The remarkable encounter of Pope St. Leo the Great and Atilla the Hun, and the conversion of these wild peoples is here explored.

9)Byzantium the new Rome - Ever heard of Caesero-Papism? Well,here you will! The emperors of Constantinople, the development of the Byzantine east and the enduring legacy of both West and east is detailed.

An excellent resource for faith enrichment in families, parishes or any one interested in the beginnings of our glorious faith.

This series has both Spanish and English soundtracks.",1305417600,32,2254,5.045822102425876
