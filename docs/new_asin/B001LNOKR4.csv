8319017,4,B001LNOKR4,"The story is a simple one and easy to understand.  I visited the enclosure when in Nairobi.  The story line is reality and the baby elephants are charming. and humorous.  The Keepers Diary tells the tale of rescuing these baby elephants detailing the danger of poaching in S.E. Africa.  The caring for these animals by their Keepers is extraordinary.  Photos are real and touching.

8319018,5,B001LNOKR4,"I enjoyed this dvd very much. I wish it were longer and the narration is not as lively but it's worth watching. It's also not as ""polished"" as the BBC Elephant Diaries production which unfortunately is not available in the US. For the price it's pretty good.",1426550400,,258,4.51063829787234

8319022,5,B001LNOKR4,"I had the very good fortune of being in Nairobi 3 years ago and one of the first things I did was to visit the wildlife trust. It was an absolutely amazing experience.

At my guide's recommendation, I stood off at the end of the visitors' area all by myself. Within minutes one of the calves got curious and came to see why I was all alone. When I picked up some grass she allowed me to feed her; then she started to push against the rope barrier trying to get closer to me. Her keeper was concerned at first - until he realized we were both having a wonderful time. She rubbed my neck with her trunk as I scratched her ears.

This marvelous DVD brought back all the wonderful memories of a very special day. Thank you!",1351641600,4,719,4.16546762589928
8319023,5,B001LNOKR4,"This was so special to watch. It was very informative about how orphaned elephants are taken care of once they are resecued. I didn't know that these keepers have to stay with them 24 hours a day, what a commitment these people make to make sure these wonderful elephants survive.",1342483200,4,280,4.62
8319024,5,B001LNOKR4,"This is a DVD of an educational film shown around Africa to educate people about elephants and the work of the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an organization devoted to wildlife conservation in Africa. DSWT does a lot of things such as de-snaring, community education and development, and wildlife preservation, but what it is most famous for is the elephant orphanage.

The film covers both the Nairobi nursery, where the baby elephant orphans under 2-3 years of age live, and the facilities at Voi in Tsavo. Although the DVD came out in 2008 here, it was filmed around 1999-2000, so if you are hoping to see some of the more recent arrivals, you will be disappointed. However, the film itself is not disappointing! I foster elephants at the DSWT, and I have seen a lot of the available videos (including the BBC's Elephant Diaries, which is not available in the US), and this film still has interesting things that I hadn't seen. I really enjoyed watching it.

It does focus mostly on the elephants at Voi and their interaction, presumably because that is the location that Kenyans are least likely to know or have seen. It also talks a little bit about the keepers, which is nice, since they are such a crucial part of the operation, both in taking care of the elephants, and helping to educate their home communities about elephants, wildlife, and conservation.

If you don't have a region-free DVD player and want to see Elephant Diaries, this DVD is actually a reasonable substitute. It isn't as slick with the editing and sound effects as the BBC production, and the narration is sometimes a bit awkward (I think it may have been written in Swahili and translated into English?), but the overall quality is high. The DVD offers 3 languages- English, Swahili, and Kikamba (which is the native language of the communities near Voi). The beginning of the video has one of the longest-serving keepers telling the story of how he got his job, and he speaks in his native language, which is subtitled into English, but the rest of it is not subtitled - it has English narration done by a native English speaker.",1234742400,15,2113,4.752043596730245
