5085532,3,B007GMKX2A,"I am a hard core New York Football Giants fan and I do have to agree with the other reveiws, the Jets and Cowboys game really should be added to the set. Those two games were make or break for the G-Men. The Road To Super Bowl XLII set included the last game of the season against New England and the Giants lost that game. Don't get me wrong, the playoff run and the Super Bowl were awesome, but I would pay a little extra to have the Jets and Cowboys games on this set.",1336176000,3,471,3.968421052631579
5085533,2,B007GMKX2A,"I agree with other posts - the Jets game could be included, the Cowboys game SHOULD be included. At that point, every game was a must win ""playoff"". Really surprised to hear these games won't be included - let's hope they reconsider. I'd even spring for a ""Deluxe"" edition that included the Jets and Cowboys games",1335744000,9,313,4.607142857142857
5085534,1,B007GMKX2A,"I'm a DIE HARD NY Giants fan and this set I couldn't wait to be released. However, having this set only contain the playoff games is an EPIC FAIL! The Giants had to win the last two games of the season. This run began with the 99 yard catch and run by Victor Cruz against the Jets. Then a do or die sunday night match up against the cowboys for the NFC East title. How both of those games are not included in this set is ridiculous. I'm sure someone will end up picking this up for me but I'm not spending my money on this set!",1335657600,10,527,3.9345794392523366
5085535,3,B007GMKX2A,"My understanding is that this set will also be available in Blu-Ray format (2 Disks with a list price of $50).  I purchased the Giants Road set for 2008 (XLII) which was only available on 4:3 standard def DVD.  For those who have 1080 HD sets, these games up-scaled poorly on both my Sony Bravia HD sets using high quality Blu-Ray players.  The video quality was marginally better on a 720p set using a std def DVD player.  I expect the same performance for the current std def DVD set and would avoid purchasing if you are planning to watch on a native 1080 HD screen. The blu-ray set from 2 years ago (Saints XLIV) had good video quality at an aspect ratio of 1.77:1 (16:9 widescreen). Last year's set (Packers XLV) on std DVD received many poor reviews on AMAZON for video quality.  I could not find a listing for a corresponding Blu-Ray set for XLV.

Surprised that NFL Films has allowed skimping on the games included in the set since the Giants are such a large market team. IMHO- As many or more sets would sell had they included the last 2 regular season games; especially since these were key games to the ""Road to the Superbowl"".  I will buy the set anyway since the games included were great Giant wins.  Lesson learned- I will make sure to record these games using a HD DVR in the future.

UPDATE: 04/29/2012 - Looks like a Blu-Ray version (2 BD discs) of the Road to SB 46 will be available as I stated in my original post.

UPDATE:  12-25-12 - The blu-ray version of this set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NFL-New-York-Giants-Road-to-Xlvi-Blu-ray/dp/B007GMKX5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NFL New York Giants: Road to Xlvi [Blu-ray</a>]offers excellent video/audio.  Game stoppage and commercials are removed without loss of game continuity.  A must have for any die hard NY Football Giants fan. After the Giants most recent embarrassing loss to Baltimore, I will probably be watching these games on Blu-Ray during this year's playoffs... BTW- I leaned about web trolls on my first review of the standard definition set that preceded the blu-ray set.  I write reviews to help people make informed buying decisions and wish a Merry Christmas to everyone- even the trolls.",1334966400,4,2228,4.954301075268817
5085536,3,B007GMKX2A,"""The Road to Super Bowl XLII"" included the Week 17 loss to the Patriots.  How many times are you going to watch that one?  So why would ""The Road to Super Bowl XLVI"" not include the Week 17 game against Dallas for the NFC East title?  And if they really wanted to do it right, they would have included the Week 16 game against the Jets as it was an elimination game.  No need to pay full price for this set.  I'll wait for a used copy.",1334966400,13,435,3.954022988505747

5085548,5,B007GMKX2A,The Giants were to win their 4th Vince Lombardy trophy despite all the odds against them they beat the Atlanta Falcons 24-2. They went to when Lambeau Field and upset the defending Super Bowl 45 Champions Green Bay Packers 37-20 just like the NFC Championships in 2008. Went to San Francisco to beat the 49ers in Overtime. And Finally they beat Tom Brady and the New England Patriots!!!!,1414540800,,387,4.705882352941177

5085552,4,B007GMKX2A,"I think this DVD was OK and Giants fans should get. All it has are the four playoff games and nothing else. No post game ceremonies etc, no other important games such as Cowboys, Jets, nothing but the four games with commercials edited out.

I also have the previous two discs
NFL- New York Giants - The Road to Super Bowl XLII  ( Game highlights w/ post game ceremonies)
&
NFL Super Bowl XLII - New York Giants Championship DVD (2008) (full 4 games with bonus last game of season w Patriots)

What I have a problem with are the people who put them out. They either have no concept of how to put this stuff together or I think they intentional leave stuff out so you wind up spending more money buying multiple copies of other videos like I did with XLII super bowl videos. What's so difficult about putting all this into one package I don't know.",1391731200,,847,4.314465408805032
5085553,5,B007GMKX2A,I was very happy with the product. was in excellent condition. It was exactly what i was looking for. I tried to purchase this before and ended up with something completely different. This was the perfect gift for my husband who is a huge Giants fan.,1388448000,,250,4.456521739130435
5085554,4,B007GMKX2A,"Watching and being a fan of the New York Giants is difficult. Wins do not come easy for the Giants, they claw and scratch their way to win this Superbowl. Each game is frustrating, knowing they win each game makes it easier to watch.

Presentation:

Menus are slick, similar to a video game, after a quick disclaimer informing you that the producers of the set tried their best to compile all game footage, you are off to go.

2 games per disc, each game can be watched fully, or you can skip to the top highlights each game has to offer.

The Superbowl features a bonus stats track, that pops up with tidbits throughout.

The only flaw, is that their is no Superbowl celebration footage, which is a letdown.

Video Quality

For the playoff games, Fox gives you HD @720p, this is a bit better than the broadcasts but not by much.

If I remember the Superbowl was broadcast on NBC, and the quality does skip up bit.",1388361600,,914,4.398809523809524
5085555,4,B007GMKX2A,"It doesn't say anything about the game against the Cowboys on the packaging, but it's in there!

5085557,5,B007GMKX2A,MY Boyfriend was thrilled with this gift. Go Giants! The only downside was I didn't realize it was BluRay and we didn;t have a player but he sold it to someone who did have one and bought the regular DVD with the money,1386028800,,218,4.093023255813954

5085559,2,B007GMKX2A,"Poor editing and lack of care.  The exclusion of the season's final two games, Dallas and Jets, demonstrates  the NFL's total lack of consideration for the Giant fan. The road to XLII was far superior and included the pivotal final game of the season vs. New England. Shame on NFL films for putting no thought into this product. This Road is Incomplete!",1372809600,,353,4.67741935483871
5085560,5,B007GMKX2A,Perfect gift to account for the G-Men's most recent Super Bowl Victory and glory over the rival Patriots. Could not have asked for a better purchase/experience.,1368748800,,160,5.1923076923076925
5085561,5,B007GMKX2A,this is a great DVD for all giants fans! being a die hard giants fan i had to pick this up. i got the road to SB XLII and loved it this one the same. every game as it was broadcasted with very good quality! defiantly a must have for gmen fans alike! only thing i disliked was no cowboys VS giants reg season finale but o well,1367452800,,325,3.7941176470588234
5085562,4,B007GMKX2A,"The Good:  The Disc contains the entire postseason run in HD quality.  It is as if you are watching it live all over again.

The No So Good:  This did not contain any pivotal regular season games.  This Blu-ray could have included any of the following:  Either Cowboys game, the Patriots regular season game or the Jets (Cruz' 99 yard TD catch and run - the biggest play of the season).

There is really no ""bad"" with this release.  I just think it could have been a little better.  Overall, I recommend it.",1366156800,,507,4.365591397849462
5085563,5,B007GMKX2A,In HD and on blu-ray is great. I purchased the 2007 super bowl set and it was only standard version and was ok. If you are Giants fan buy with confidence and it was nice seeing the whole games over and see that the games could have gone either way.,1364947200,,248,3.98

5085587,5,B007GMKX2A,"these are the playoff games leading to the superbowl and then the superbowl itself.  if you love the giants like i do, seeing them win over and over and beating some of the best teams is beyond worth it.  i HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who's a giants fan or who wants to see the games the giants needed to win to make it to the superbowl.",1359072000,,341,4.074626865671642
5085588,5,B007GMKX2A,All televised playoff games on DVD. Probably the best game of the four is the NFC Championship game and that game was where Eli Manning really shined.,1357948800,,150,4.592592592592593

5085593,4,B007GMKX2A,Game video was exactly what I expected - I was used to the abreviated format from the Road to XLII. I loved seeing all the playoff games in addition to the Superbowl but also would have liked to see the last two games of the season (vs. Jets and Cowboys) which were key to the Giants playoff run.,1350000000,,296,4.120689655172414
5085594,5,B007GMKX2A,"The Giants Super Bowl XLVI DVD boxed set was everything I expected (since I have their Super Bowl XLII DVD set as well).  Since the discs are a copy of the TV feed I knew that they'd be great.  The only minus I see is that while the DVD of SB 42 included the last regular season game against the Patriots which set up the SB rematch later, this set didn't include the last regular season Giants-Dallas game that got the Giants to the playoffs and their second SB in 4 years.  It's a small oversight and it doesn't take much away from the fun of reliving the Giants incredible playoff run.  If you're a Giants fan you have to have this DVD.",1347062400,,639,4.170731707317073
5085595,5,B007GMKX2A,"How could you NOT have this item if you're a Giants fan? I got it on Blu-Ray...which makes it even better. You get to see and appreciate somethings you might have missed watching at the Sports Bar, or the football party with all the noise and celebrating you did. Only negative I have is...it shoulda included the week 17 smackdown we put on Da Girls!!! Other than that....PURE FIRE baby!",1345248000,,388,4.557142857142857

5085598,5,B007GMKX2A,"GREAT! Blu-Ray is the way to relive this past season's spectactor come from behind season to win the Super Bowl. The only downside is no Dallas games were included,as I live in South Texas surrounded by Dallas fans!",1343520000,,215,4.684210526315789
5085599,5,B007GMKX2A,First of all the quality of the disk itself is great and I encountered no problems watching it. This is my first Blu-ray disk which made it even more enjoyable for me. Now as for the games themselves it is so great to be able to watch them with no commercial interruptions. I watched the first two games on one weekend then the next two the following weekend and just loved watching my team win another championship.  If you're a GIANTS fan you have to buy this item and relive what turned out to be a remarkable season.,1343174400,,520,4.3061224489795915
5085600,4,B007GMKX2A,"Only downside is that I wish the DVD set contained the Week 17 game as the Road to SB 42 did. It was a nice kickoff to the post season. That said, high quality video and I like that it was the broadcast feed. Great to hear the announcers question calls or enjoy replays of some major highlights",1342310400,,294,4.086206896551724
5085601,1,B007GMKX2A,"I purchased The Road To SuperBowl 42 after the GIANTS ended what the PATs thought was an undefeated season.
I was happy with the packaging and the SAP channel with STRAHAN's running commentary on the game.
That set included all playoff games AND the week 17 close loss to PATRIOTS.

With a win at Superbowl 46 I expected a similar product.

Packaging has gone cheap (42 has blue and red foil sections).
NO SAP commentary on the game from any player or even GIANTS play by plan man Bob Papa.
A fortune was there if there was a SAP channel catering to all the hispanic VICTOR CRUZ fans.
There was a 'miked-up' version of the Superbowl shown on NFL network, even that would have been nice to have.

Video quality is strange almost like watching 3-D in 2D.
There is a disclaimer that comes up before the SUPERBOWL indicating broadcast to tape etc and therefore some footage and/or plays might be missing.
THAT WARNING SHOULD BE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE PACKAGE SO IT CAN BE READ BEFORE OPENING THE DVD.

The price for this set has jumped and this package doesn't even include the half-time show.
No post game awarding of trophies either.
The last two regular season games were must-wins for the GIANTS;
One game against in-town rivals NYJETS and then the season closer (essentially the NFC EAST Championship game) vs. long time rival DALLAS.
Including those two games could have made this a great product from NFL FILMS.
Instead I feel that NFL Films is taking advantage of GIANT fan loyalty. Think twice before purchasing a product from NFL FILMS.

I sent a letter to Mr. Sabol of NFL Films. If he responds I'll share that here.

***UNINTENDED BONUS:
Al Michaels seems to be concerned that we somehow can't watch a game without his constant patter.
In an effort to keep us informed he explains the MHK Patch on the Patriots jersey ""is for MYRA KRAFT, the widow of Bob Kraft"".
Of course Myra Kraft is deceased and Bob Kraft is the widower of Myra Kraft.
Keep talking Al.",1342137600,,1963,4.5625
5085602,4,B007GMKX2A,"I don't know what version some of you bought, but my Blu-ray copy has a bonus disc with the Cowboys game!  I highly doubt that they would release two different versions (One with the Cowboys game, one without it), so it seems to me that many of you are complaining about a product that you don't even have!  This release is just like the road to Super Bowl 42, it has the last game of the season, and the 4 playoff games.  What more could you ask for?, and this time around it's in HD!",1341878400,12,485,4.08421052631579
5085603,4,B007GMKX2A,"I'll start by saying this.  If you're a Giants fan, no matter whether or not you record the games yourself and no matter if they are at SD or HD resolution, it's DEFINITELY worth getting this set.  The video quality of this blu ray is exactly like the original broadcast, only without advertisements.  All of the replays and commentary in between plays are here.

Unfortunately, as with all other NFL Films game releases, they have included no pregame, halftime or postgame.  This is partially the reason I gave it only 4 stars.  But I have those on my DVD recordings, so it's not a huge loss for me.  My other gripe is that the audio is NOT 5.1 Dolby Digital.  REALLY, NFL Films?  The game was broadcast in 5.1, how hard would it be to include that audio track?

Anyway, back to the positives.  This set is a great set to have when you want to watch the game and only the game.  You can watch all 4 games in a very manageable 8.5 hours.  Even if you capture games in HD quality, it's nice to have a backup in case your media ever fails.  And not to mention the fact that you can watch the games with no ads and you don't have to edit them out yourself.

I highly recommend this set.",1340928000,,1183,4.21875
5085614,5,B007GMKX2A,"""New York Giants: Road to XLVI"" is another 'must have' for all Giants Fans. It contains the 3 Giants' Playoff Game wins, and of course Super Bowl XLVI. The games are the complete network broadcasts. If you have an HDTV and Blu-ray player, make sure you get the Blu-ray version. The transfer is superb, and it looks better than my HD DVR recordings I saved from the games. I agree with everyone that believes ""Road to XLVI"" could have been better if had the Dallas and/or Jet games included. With that being said though, I still consider ""Road to XLVI"" a 5 star Blu-ray collection, and a 'must have' for all Giants' fans.",1339372800,21,620,4.495575221238938

I bought the road to the superbowl XLVI and absolutely love it. I went to superbowl XLVI and was able to relive the moments of the game from my television. This run is very similar in that the Giants had got into the playoffs and turned on the gas at the right time to hand the Cheatriots another superbowl loss! For those of you that want to see the Cowboys and Jets game, I totally understand and I would have liked to have that as well. Nevertheless, as a big Giants fan I can't wait to get my hands on this.

They just won their 2nd Super Bowl in 5 years, and this set will allow you to relive the excitement all over again. It may or may not be pristine video quality that at least some are demanding, or it may not have mind blowing audio that an audiophile demands in everything, but what it DOES have is 4 games that had me on the edge of my seat and repeatedly screaming at top volume, much to the dismay of my neighbors. You will not get the last 2 regular season games against Dallas and the NYJ, but really...who cares? You'll get to relive the shutout of Atlanta, the toppling of the great 15-1 Packers AT LAMBEAU, the savage beating that Eli Manning took at SF, and yet he kept getting up and fighting. Finally, the epic rematch against the Patriots, which saw Big Blue reign victorious once again! C'mon...if that isn't enough to get your blood boiling, then I question your true fanhood. I guess there will always be people who HAVE to complain about something, or they simply wouldn't be able to function normally. Don't pay any attention to them, as they aren't real Giants fans.

8516397,4,B007GMKX2A,Would be perfect if it included the Cowboys game that got them into the playoffs. Other than that this is a must have for Giants fans,1451606400,,133,4.153846153846154
8516398,4,B007GMKX2A,"I ordered this blu-ray set in November 2015 from Amazon themselves and it came with the bonus third disc which has the game against the Cowboys, so that former shortcoming is not an issue for me.  The games look great and move along nicely without the commercial breaks and pre- and post-game shows.  Four stars because some little bits of the games are missing due to the editing of commercials and the timing of coming back to the game after commercials.  Nothing major, not bad enough to be annoying, but enough to be noticeable.  Overall a very good set and it reinforces your ability as a Giants fan to say, ""I don't get why everyone hates the Patriots so much, they never beat us in the Super Bowl.""",1449705600,2,705,4.484375
