8561128,5,B00B1VP2OG,"I have a LOT to learn, never heard of the PROMS before, but I have a whole new respect for what they are doing and the BBC orchestra--WOW!!!!  The PQ on this blu-ray is splendid, AWESOME as is the sound!  The sound track is DTS-HD MA 5.1 and it brings the sound of this wonderful performance right into my home theater.  SO MUCH delightful music here!!!  The Berloiz overture is just to whet your appetite.  The sound of the grand piano on the Chopin Concerto is totally rich, full and clearly LOVELY!  I much prefer this type of recording, where the piano is close enough miked that we get every note, but not so in your face that it does not blend in with the orchestra.  This is a whole concert we are treated to here, something like 5th row center.  Here the camera work throws us off somewhat, as we may be close up watching the soloists hands playing the piano or the bassoon player's fingering (and often the camera is following a noteworthy instrument playing at that time) but we are still hearing the WHOLE orchestra playing so very well together.  Individual stunning performances here for sure, Freire (a Brasilero pianist of great note) is amazing and fluid, expressive and commanding on the piano, and other superb players as well.  But the wall of sound in my room is full orchestra, violins on the left, celli/basses on the right and piano square in the middle.... DELICIOUS sound!!!!!!
Then we are treated to a short Gluck piece on the solo piano--SWEET AS!!!!!  After a break the Roussel Symphony #3, which I had never heard before--WHOA it is good stuff!  And Ravel's ""Daphne and Chloe"" to round off the night (check out the amazing flute section!) wonderfully.
FULLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!",1430352000,3,1710,4.663333333333333
8561129,5,B00B1VP2OG,The Chopin Piano Concerto (I used to play passages of this) is superbly played by Nelson Freire. It is wonderful to see such a great new young conductor; all smiles and totally in control with his inspiring leadership.,1376524800,,218,4.7631578947368425
8561130,5,B00B1VP2OG,"I acquired this DVD for the express purpose of finding out if all of the excitement and positive reviews that have been reported about this young conductor in the print media were warranted.  They most definitely are!...and then some.  Maestro Lionel Bringuier brings to the podium an extremely sensitive and nuanced understanding of the music on display in this album.  I am thrilled to know that he is deserving of all the kudos lavished upon him and I'm looking forward to following his future career.

Mr. Freire's performance of the Chopin No. 2 is brilliant, both strong and romantic in all of the right places.  The collaboration between conductor and pianist couldn't be better and the BBC Symphony Orchestra is perfection throughout this entire album.",1374624000,3,760,5.048
8561131,5,B00B1VP2OG,"This concert, recorded in 2010, marked Lionel Bringuier's dbut appearance at the Proms. This was not his first performance with either the BBC SO or with Nelson Freire however and it is immediately clear that there is already close understanding between all of these musicians.

The concert starts off with a sizzling performance of the Corsaire Overture by Berlioz. The slow introduction is certainly given full rein for expression and this leads to an exhilaration second part which is exciting enough to raise smiles of enjoyment among the ranks of the orchestra.

Nelson Freire then performs Chopin's second piano concerto. Curiously the Chopin concertos are becoming quite a feature of Blu-ray concerts and this is now the third in my collection. As such it clearly stands apart from both Kissin, who is on top form in this concerto, and Ohlsson, who also provides a fine performance. Both of those pianists are accompanied by the Warsaw PO conducted by Antoni Wit and it is immediately apparent on this BBC SO disc how much superior the orchestral response is. There is considerably greater definition of the lines within the orchestral writing and far more interaction between the players and the pianist. This superiority would also apply when compared to several CDs that I have had and some I still own. This extra dimension is largely to do with more attentive and aware conducting, strange though it may seem in one so relatively inexperienced (on paper at least).

Nelson Freire delivers quite a different performance than usual and I was constantly reminded of his strong and purposeful performance of the Brahms concertos. He is both strong and purposeful here too and in this concerto there was the sort of excitement at climaxes that one can get with many other Romantic concertos but rarely associated with the Chopin works. As a consequence this concerto is far less of a piano solo with subservient orchestra and much more a standard fully fledged Romantic concerto. None of this is to say that there is insensitivity here, witness the slow movement. However the balance is clearly changed and the whole work becomes bigger and more substantial. The encore, on the other hand and an arrangement of Gluck, has all the feather-light filigree that one could imagine. This is a very fine and thought provoking concerto performance.

I thought that you might like to know that before I buy a recording I now look through all the reviews to see if you have posted one. Your assessments and opinions are invaluable. Thank you. (US review)

The Roussel third symphony is given a tightly rhythmical performance of some virtuosity from the orchestra. This is considered his masterpiece by many and this performance brings out every detail from this complex score with both humour and drama. An outstanding orchestral effort here.

The concert finishes with the second Daphnis Suite by Ravel. Once more the opening sunrise sequence allows for the greatest expression with bird song adorning truly sumptuous string and brass phrasing which rise to impressive peaks. The concluding dance is one of the most exciting I have heard with absolutely precise playing from all under clear direction that builds effortlessly to a thrilling conclusion. The tempo is fast but not so fast as to endanger every detail hitting its mark.

In conclusion this is a particularly fine concert. The very large audience is remarkably quiet and there are no unwanted additions from the Promenaders. The imaging is spectacularly clear, of good colour and with plenty of orchestral detail at the right times and in unobtrusive ways. The sound is provided in DTS 51. Master Audio as well as stereo. The resultant sound is predictably wide ranging, well balanced and spectacular as well as being faithful.

I would suggest that this concert is worthy of very serious consideration as a concert compilation or as fine performances of the individual works.
