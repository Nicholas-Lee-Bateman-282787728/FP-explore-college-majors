7077241,5,B00V7ORW2M,"Great movie,  you should give it a try and just forget the fact the main characters are a teacher and a student. Oh yes, the teacher is an alien, a very attractive one at that. The more Japanese anime movies/mini series  you watch the more you will find out they all seem to take on the same story line, the parents either have passed away or they have moved overseas and leave the kids to fend for themselves. Almost always take place in a high school setting of some sort and the male lead somehow always ends up with a troupe of lovely young ladies following him around and will do anything for him. If you want to call it a ""harem"" that's fine too. The graphics are not that great but the colors seem to jump off the TV. This will probably depend on your display and type of video equipment you have. I love watching anime and have probably spent a little more than I should have on my electronics but what the heck you can't take it with you.  Enjoy!!",1433289600,,956,4.213114754098361
7077242,5,B00V7ORW2M,"Please Teacher is one of my favorite romance series. I will not be discussing the series but the DVD itself.

The case is a standard DVD case with a ""page"" of two discs and the third disc on the inside back of the case.
The DVD includes the Japanese Dub with English Subtitles and the English Dub. Personally I like both but I know some people like one or the either so to each their own.
The bonus features includes three music clips which includes the closing song It also includes clean openings and closings. There are also two commercials for the series in japanese and two previews for Episode 13 or the extra OVA. There is also a small short story called Marie Love Theater which is about Marie and his love for Miruru.

So if you are looking for a good romance anime or are an old or new fan of please teacher then this is a great buy.",1430092800,,843,4.229813664596273
7077243,5,B00V7ORW2M,"Kei looks like any normal 15 year old high schooler in a small town community - has friends, a girl who secretly likes him, and two guardians who care for him.  But he has a secret, he is actually 18 due to an illness that left him in a coma for three years.  But things change when he meets his new high school teacher Miss Kazami.  She is pretty, smart, his neighbor, and has a secret herself - she is an alien observer to Earth as her father was from our planet.  But when secrets are revealed between these two and an embarassing situation being locked in the gyms storage room, there is only one thing to do - get married.  Now Kei and Mizuko learn that being newlyweds is no easy task and will face many challenges, from keeping their relationship a secret, living together, her family, and when another girl starts hitting on Kei.  Can this couple overcome their issues and move forward, or will time stop once again for one of them?

This was one of the first series that got me back into anime, and it is enjoyable.  The characters are well written and fleshed out, the story moves well, and each situation is very believable (despite the whole alien thing).  If you enjoy slice-of life, rom-com stories this is a must have for any fan.",1428537600,10,1245,4.378260869565217
8709548,4,B00V7ORW2M,An old classic anime that was actually pretty clean and fun to watch because of the situation they have put themselves in.,1513296000,,122,4.590909090909091
8709549,4,B00V7ORW2M,"I've been puzzling over this since I first heard of it because, on the surface, there seems to be little reason for controversy.  There is no nudity, not even partial nudity, and no onscreen sex.  (There is far more nudity on display in normal, even censored for TV Japanese animation today than there is in this.)  So why the controversy?  Because this show concentrates on a particular Japanese taboo: sex between students and teachers.

Of course, this being a comedy show, that isn't what is really going on.  The hero, Kei Kusanagi, may look and act 15 but due to a made for TV only  rare disease is actually 18.  Meanwhile the heroine, Mizuho Kazami, is a 23-year-old half-alien observer of Earth, disguised as a school teacher.  Due to a series of ridiculous circumstances, in order to protect Mizuho's secret, Kei reveals his, and as a result Kei and Mizuho are officially if secretly married before they've even kissed, much less anything else, and the joke is that of all the peculiar couples in this show (including students with teachers), they are having the least sex, in fact none at all until almost the end due to a never ending avalanche of peculiar circumstances, including the ultimate switcheroo in OVA episode 13.

Apparently blessed with success, the creators decided to try, try again with a sequel series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Please-Twins/dp/B00XRFT5CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Please Twins!</a>, but ended up flipping most of the ideas that made the first series work.",1477094400,,1550,5.289795918367347
8709550,5,B00V7ORW2M,Finding love from far away place in outer space is hard and finding love on earth it's all ways challenging but worth it!,1467849600,,121,4.304347826086956
8709551,4,B00V7ORW2M,"An 18 year old, pretending to be a 15 year old, is forced to marry, and live with.... through circumstances beyond his control.... none other than his beautiful 20 something homeroom teacher.... Who happens to be an alien from a galactic surveillance organization. What could possibly go wrong in this scenario....

This is a very strange and quirky Anime. Not to say it is bad..... It's not.... But the reason I give four stars is the very nature of what makes it quirky is also what does some damage. For all of it's romantic theme and slice of life, there are some really campy parts that detracted from it. I'm not going to lie and say I readily jump on the whole romance bandwagon where anime is concerned, although if through out the course of a show there are romantic implications, I don't get upset or refuse to watch because of it. I really do in fact like a little romance in my stories. That being said..... The problem I have is the obligatory clich's that happen through the series. The always interrupted kiss, the brat sibling who hates the boyfriend (or husband in this case, and is trying to kill him, literally....) but, then ends up loving him, the seductress mother-in-law, the non-stop ""This isn't what it looks like"" scenes followed by a bunch of apologies........, a main character who is more concerned with not hurting others, and who lacks the spine to go with what's in his heart to make others happy, or to tell anyone how he really feels until forced to do so...... which hurts others, causing everything else to always going wrong. Honestly, if that is what life was really like, most of us would need heavy doses of Prozac and Ridilin...... What I did like about this story, was the story itself. I was entertained, and even felt a little emotional at the end. There are some very deep feelings associated with this series, and while some of them are overly expressed, others are more subtle in nature. I don't want to put anyone off or onto this series one way or the other... I will just say, if you are a fan of action, horror, and the like, you would almost assuredly not enjoy this. If pure romantic comedy is more your style, and you don't mind shedding a few tears over broken hearts and hurt feelings, then I would say this is for you.... Just one anime lover's humble opinion.......",1457568000,3,2323,4.557416267942584

8709557,4,B00V7ORW2M,"A lot of fun, some teasing and some hilarious situations as the 'quiet boy' of the school somehow winds up first in the arms and then in the heart of the hottest teacher at the school.  The twists and turns as they try to hide their relationship from the rest of the school, and the town, are not helped when her mother and sister (who does NOT approve) show on target curious to meet this boy.  Then the standstills kick in again, and Kei finds he is not alone in having them, all winding up in the pressure to cause a 'grand-mal' standstill that nearly kills him and sets the scene for a major shakeup amongst the main characters.  And the final episode is one of fun and frivolity that releases the pressure built up over the previous 12, and led to a giggling fit on my part.  Highly enjoyable, and I watched the series over and over.  Enjoy!",1435795200,2,846,4.29559748427673
