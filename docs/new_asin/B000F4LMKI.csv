2551105,4,B000F4LMKI,"Icon Men's Greg Plitt workout DVD is an excellent production and very much worth purchasing. Greg demonstrates a wide range of bicep, tricep, and ab exercises. His description and performance of each exercise gives the viewer a good understanding of why and how to perform the movement.

The introduction section of the DVD fills the viewer in about Greg's background and how became a top fitness model. Most of the DVD, however, is devoted to demonstrations of the specific exercises he recommends, and there are a lot of them. Greg has an amazing physique, with especially impressive biceps and abs.

Production values are high, with good sound and picture quality throughout.

Highly recommended for those looking for workout inspiration and information.",1198972800,2,757,5.239669421487603
2551106,5,B000F4LMKI,"Greg is a worldclass body builder I've seen for many years.  I couldn't wait to get this DVD and learn his secrets.  I was not disappointed.

2551107,5,B000F4LMKI,"Awesome DVD! You learn about the man himself and then get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of the DVD-- his workout. VERY informative. Highly recommended! As smart as he is handsome. Hopefully, Greg will do another one showing us his workout for legs and glutes. PLEASE GREG!",1157846400,,271,4.787234042553192

8117291,3,B000F4LMKI,"I bought this because I saw this guy on a reality show and I thought I'd see what he could teach me.  I did learn a few new things, but mostly, one needs to have access to a gym in order to perform most of the exercises in this video. Not a bad video, but I've seen better.",1353456000,2,273,3.706896551724138
8117292,1,B000F4LMKI,"Maybe it could be a good DVD that maybe could help wiht different techniques.... but the seller sent me a broken DVD Box and the DVD disc is competely Scratched .... I've seen something like this.... for me.... worst transaction ever. Seriously I lost my money with this... I really hope to have a refund.... because I lost my money and that DVD is useless. Amazon I'm still waiting for some answers.

And by the way, the DVD Box is very crappy, It looks like someone printed the cover at home then pasted with some school glue, and sent the DVD.",1351296000,,546,4.405940594059406
8117293,4,B000F4LMKI,"First off, I did not realize that this DVD is meant to appeal to a ""certain type"" of guy.
Fortunately for me it does not cross the line or get too suggestive.
The good thing about this program is the helpful advice & good training tips.
Once I got passed a feeling of awkwardness, I found the program useful.
Just be warned if, like myself, you don't find men attractive!!!",1343433600,,373,4.3428571428571425

8117295,5,B000F4LMKI,"Greg Plitt not only demonstrates a multitude of various exercises,he explains which head of which muscle is worked by varying different grips,which exercises should be done first(and why)and which should be done last. Greg Plitt is a born teacher,he shows the proper form as well as improper form. I have given two of these as presents to people who are trainers and they are as enthusiastic as I am.",1232236800,3,400,4.811594202898551
8117296,5,B000F4LMKI,"I originally purchased this for my hubby to use, but came to find that I really like it.  I had watched Greg Plitt on ""Work Out"" on Bravo and knew he was in awesome shape, but I didn't know how good his DVD would be.  It's great.  He's well versed on his profession and does a great job of demonstrating the exercises that he likes best.  I'd call myself advanced as far as weight-training and exercise goes and this video still kicked my butt!",1229644800,4,444,4.25
