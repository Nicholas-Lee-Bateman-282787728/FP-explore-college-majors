8723860,2,B0118S6VRS,"I am usually a really big supporter of Necrostorm films, as they produce some of the most insanely vile and fun films I have ever seen (Adam Chaplin and Hotel Inferno to name just two of their most entertaining works). But this movie was just an exercise in spite; the premise is that a girl doesn't help a group of clowns, so her and her puppy have to suffer for it? I mean, it's just not a great premise, and I was more put off by the whole plot than anything.  Then you have the plodding pace, where nothing happens for extended periods of time, and some of the most convoluted plot holes I have ever encountered in cinema, and you have a film that probably didn't work on paper, and sure as hell doesn't work on film.
The one saving grace is the special effects, and as always, Necrostorm outdoes itself. The gore and practical effects are so visceral, I cringed. unfortunately, there is not enough of it to redeem this mess. Sorry, Necrostorm, this is a dud. Avoid.",1442966400,2,970,4.388888888888889
