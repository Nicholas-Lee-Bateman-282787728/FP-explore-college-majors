8289401,5,B001CU95SU,"David Schifter's portrayal of Col. James Gavin was both accurate and respectable. Not only does the actor have an uncanny resemblance to the American hero, he obviously did his research into the character.
  ""Combat Jump"" is well worth watching for a look at how a man went against all of the odds to win this aerial assault battle during WW2.",1288396800,2,343,4.7
