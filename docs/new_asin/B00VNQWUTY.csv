7100195,5,B00VNQWUTY,This video gives a great perspective of how vast and amazing our universe is! It  correlates greatly with 8th grade Sunshine State Standards!,1456876800,,141,5.130434782608695
7100196,5,B00VNQWUTY,"This is really two stories - First, Who and How was Hubbell developed?

Second, What are the new discoveries it has produced? Both are interesting.

Briefly covers the beginning idea in 1947 for a space telescope. Launch in 1990. Disaster! Really bad pictures! How to fix and save NASA? Excellent coverage of the people and the months of work to find the answer. Then team of astronauts need to be trained (underwater) to repair Hubble in space. Twenty months of practice. Shows film of the astronauts replacing parts in space. Wow!

Includes many marvelous photographs of the cosmos seen for the first time. Fantastic! Explains the many new conclusions due to the new information. Age of universe, black holes, dark energy, etc. are now known.

Covers Edwin Hubbell's discovery of expanding universe. Einstein floored. (He originally added an additional mathematical 'constant' to enable relativity to predict a static universe. Admitted later: ""My greatest blunder"".)

Confirmed Big Bang. Universe is not eternal, it began 13.7 billion years ago. This confirms Genesis and discredits Aristotle. One stunning revelation by Hubble was the number of stars. Two followed by twenty-two zeros.

This film uses the Bibical comparison God provided Abraham. . .

""The stars of heaven like the grains of sand on the sea shore."" Genesis 22:17. Amazing! The visible night sky has only about 10,000 stars. How did Moses know? My grandson, 10 years old, said: ""God should sue them for using words from His book!""

The increasing speed of cosmic expansion was a shock to the scientific world. Two teams won Nobel prize for this discovery.

 Isaiah 42:17 says 'God is stretching out the heavens like a fine gauze.' How precise! Notice the implied continuing movement. Only known in this century. How did Isaiah know?

As Einstein famously wrote:

""Science without religion is lame, and religion without science is blind.""

 Is this case, Einstein 'injured or lamed"" his magnificent work, by ignoring a scriptural - 'religious' - clue. Religion was 'blind' to the astounding vision of the universe that is 'like the sands of the seas'. Hubble revealed both insights. Astounding!

The staggering beauty, the overwhelming immensity, the intricate forces, the puzzling enigmas, inspire a rare quality in our world: Humility.",1450742400,4,2306,5.194594594594594

7100200,5,B00VNQWUTY,"Nova covers the history of the Hubble Space Telescope in this episode.  It is one of the greatest scientific instruments of all time, but not without a long, even checkered history.  It took a long time to get it started and it had a lot of problems along the way.  It's a miracle that it's done as well as it has.

The story begins just after World War II when astronomer Lyman Spitzer predicts that a telescope in space would be a great thing for astronomy.  A young woman astronomer named Nancy Roman spent her life trying to convince NASA that it could be built and they should do it.

Nova tells us the background of the Hubble, especially how it's keeping the legacy of Edwin Hubble alive in its work in astronomy.  We hear from a number of experts in astronomy who worked with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), astronauts and technicians who helped repair and maintain it, and even a group that won a Nobel Prize by discovering dark energy with the HST.

As always, Nova does a great job of telling the story in detail and from many different angles.  I just wish there was more of it.

If you have ever wondered how the Hubble came to be, where the maker of all those beautiful photographs of the Heavens came from, this is the thing to watch.  Entertaining and educational from start to finish.",1438560000,4,1303,4.432773109243698

7100202,5,B00VNQWUTY,"Like the previous reviewer, I found this program inspiring.

I have not been to the Grand Canyon, but I was reminded of another NOVA documentary that included a Turkish family who had never seen the ocean.  On seeing the ocean for the first time, one of the women said something like The mind of Allah is full of wonders.  I could never have conceived of something this marvelous.  When I look at the Hubble images from across the universe, I feel like that woman seeing the ocean for the first time.

I have seen other Hubble documentaries but this one from NOVA is my favorite.  It doesnt have some of the engineering details of the Nat Geo programs, but its more recent.  It explains the main discoveries from Hubble and shows stunning images.  I enjoyed learning about the individual and collective geniuses at NASA--men and women with persistence and courage who worked for years to put this telescope into orbit, repair it, and service it to greatly enhance scientific knowledge and to inspire people like me.

Im getting this dvd as a Christmas gift for my brother who has had to working evenings this past year.  I know hell enjoy it.",1434672000,9,1142,4.63681592039801
7100203,5,B00VNQWUTY,"I remember when I visited Grand Canyon years and years ago after few days of hiking, tears did flow from my eyes on my last day of visit. Witnessing such an unbelievable creation by whoever was so shocking to me that I could not soak in what I had witnessed after so many days of hiking. What Mr. Hubble started decades ago and what NASA has offered human specie on this planet earth through Hubble Space Telescope experiment that started well over 25 years ago, did bring the same emotions back to me after watching this documentary especially knowing that HST will be left dying somewhere in apace and all we can do is hopefully to recover the mirror of HST when falling back to planet earth in few decades.

This is a very informative documentary about human accomplishments especially by those geniuses in NASA who have gathered all the knowledge offered through the eyes of HST as well as giving human race a window to possibly examine where we may be from. American ingenuity at its best. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1429747200,18,1015,4.607734806629834

It may be the boldest experiment ever undertaken in astronomywith a legacy that will endure for centuries.  This single toolthe HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPEhas revealed [such things as] the size and age of the Universe, the birthplace of stars, and the existence of black holes.  Its helped us find planets like our own in far-off solar systems and a mysterious force--dark energythat makes up about seventy percent of the Universe.

The story of Hubble is the story of discovery.  Its also the story of one of the biggest blunders in the history of science.  And of the genius and courage that saved the day.

Now on Hubbles 25th anniversary, NOVA tells the remarkable tale of how this magnificent machine was built, how it solved some of our most enduring mysteries, and how it is showing us a Universe as beautiful as it is astounding.

The above is said by the narrator at the beginning of the magnificent documentary about the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).

This film does a fantastic job of tracing the history of NASAs HST from its conception (in 1946!), telling us about the astronomer its named after, Edwin Hubble (1889 to 1953), and introducing us to the mother of the Hubble.

We then see its deployment in low Earth orbit on April, 1990 and the discovery that the HST needed glasses to see properly!  Then we eavesdrop on the 1993 servicing space mission that actually put the new glasses on it and the resultant drama to see if they actually worked.

The last part of this documentary is absolutely stunning as were told of some of the key questions Hubble has answered.  For example:

(1) How old is the Universe?
(2) How many stars are in the Universe?
(3) How do galaxies (a gravitationally bound system of stars) actually form?

Finally, the images shown throughout are mind-boggling and the animation is instructive.  Brief comments are provided by experts.

In conclusion, there are not enough words to describe the magnificence of this wonderful documentary!!!
