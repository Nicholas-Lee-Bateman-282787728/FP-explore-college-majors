8526591,4,B000058TMM,"If Ken Burn's documentary ""Baseball"" left you wanting to know more about the remarkable Buck O'Neil, then this is the perfect companion DVD to that series. The first part of this DVD is a pretty straight-forward telling of the life of Buck O'Neil, professionally done but tame compared to Ken Burns' work.
The real gems are the interviews with Buck O'Neil, intimate conversations with a great man who shrugs off that title. He speaks with wonderful candor of the legends of the Negro League, of his days as the first black coach in the Majors and just about life in general. The DVD makes you work a bit to get at some of the extra interviews. They're worth it!",992217600,5,661,4.563025210084033
8526592,5,B000058TMM,"The Buck O'Neil story is a must for anyone interested in the history of the Great American Pastime - Baseball.
The biography portion of the program is an insightful tour through the life of a former player, coach, and manager of the Negro Leagues, as well as, a respected and loved Kansas Citian.
The interview with Buck provides the viewer with a look into the love that Buck has for life, baseball, his church, his community, and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum.
The picture portion of the program shows original photos from the ""barnstorming"" days with greats such as Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige.
The entire DVD is just plain wonderful.",991267200,5,643,4.801801801801802
