208163,5,6160601083,"I am not familiar with this particular merchandise. I only saw 20 episodes on netflix.com, not 30. It kept my interest the entire time. It is so refreshing to watch a clean story without having sexually explicit scenes going on. It didn't seem like it was missing anything. The acting was realistic. There were a few curse words in the beginning, but I don't think there was any after those one or two short scenes. It was really interesting to see the work life of restaurant staff. If you like cooking shows, you will like this one. I really enjoyed watching it and learned some different ways to make pasta.",1370044800,4,610,4.554545454545455
208164,4,6160601083,"Great Korean drama. Well acted. I did however find it annoying that an adult woman would act completely child-like and the man very mean. Overall, a good plot. Whoever translated the subtitles did not have good command of the English language, but it was still decent. In a few spots the subtitles were missing. Episodes contain scenes missing from K-Drama too.",1364688000,5,361,4.934426229508197

208169,5,6160601083,"The Movie is exceptionally, good. In fact, I think it is  excellent. I have watched it three times already! However I had trouble with tape No. ""5"". When I contacted the owner about this, it was promptly replaced although she wanted me to ship the bad tape back at my own expense.
When I balked at this she offered to reimbures me for my postage and even through in a ""Snow White"" tape as a bonus. Trouble is, the tape isin a foreign language  and does not have ""captions"" and I cannot understand a word of it. Duh...",1416787200,2,517,4.26530612244898

208172,4,6160601083,Have watched this drama several times on Netflix free online and always enjoyed watching because it was so entertaining so I decided to buy it.  The only thing I didn't like was that the lead actress sure acted DUMB (like a middle school kid)!,1395619200,,243,4.5227272727272725
208173,5,6160601083,"I haven't ordered this DVD, but prefer to watch and re-watch ""Pasta"" on Netflix streaming and Dramafever.com.  I love this show and I'm a big fan of Korean Dramas (I've seen over 40).  This is my favorite korean drama, though many find this one boring because it's not action packed and not really ""drama"" packed.  It's slow and sweet, like love is in reality.  The main leads don't fall for each other overnight and I find that incredibly refreshing as far as Kdramas go.  I also love the main actor and actress and their polar personalities, and all of the other characters are just as charming.  Every time I watch this show I feel like I'm visiting old friends.  ""Pasta"" has a special place in my heart!",1390348800,4,707,4.519685039370079
208174,3,6160601083,"The drama itself is great, but I had to return it because a few of the DVDs were freezing and skipping.",1388016000,,103,3.9523809523809526
208175,3,6160601083,"This just okay series that I didn't finish watching is superior because of the two leads - she's really a submarine and he gets to be very weird.  You won't learn anything about cooking or about pasta.  What I will really remember about this drama is not the uncomfortable sensation of voyeurism of watching a spark between two people but the UNBELIEVABLE and frankly GROSS maneater interest of the restaurant owner's older sister for an obviously YOUNGER cook  who sort of flirts with her.  That is AMAZING and the character is incredibly dirty but it becomes very amusing when you realize that this comments on the popularity of such Korean boy actors in Japan with older married female fans.  VERY POPULAR - like probably Yukio Mishima popular.

GROSS but LOL.

Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

so for me, Pasta is the series that taught me to laugh OUT LOUD instead of being dismayed at this recent trend of younger males cast opposite older females in Kdrama.  It's all for a good cause.

OH MY GOD!!",1381017600,,1020,4.912280701754386
7802659,5,6160601083,Fantastic Drama and this is a rare edition that has the extra 10 episodes that were not available in the United States.  Good subs also,1453939200,,135,4.4

I was also wondering if there may be  a copy of Padam Padam to purchase. If there is please write me, I will definitely want to order it.
Thank you , Rose Ralph",1434844800,,322,3.735294117647059

7802667,5,6160601083,"I was totally hooked after watching the first episode.  I ended up watching all 17 (I believe) episodes in just a few days.  It's a great series. Sad to say, it's no longer streamed on Netflix.  I hope they bring it back.",1426636800,,221,4.214285714285714
7802668,5,6160601083,"I enjoyed watching this TV series - I did not want it to end, and I think that it is one of Korea's very best love stories.  Gong Hyo-jin is again the female lead and two men fall in love with her.  She does not choose the nice guy.  The scenes of Korean chefs cooking pasta in the kitchen in an Italian restaurant are very well done.  The cast members are great and work very well together, at a fast pace and with never a dull moment.  Five years previously, Gong Yoo's character falls in love with Gong Hyo-jin in Biscuit Teacher and Star Candy (Hello My Teacher - 2005).  She is certainly one of Korea's best actresses in movies and in TV shows.
In The First Shop of Coffee Prince (2007)  Lee Sung Gyun (Lee Sun-Kyun) plays a nerdy song writer.  In Pasta (2010) he is a very emotional, loud, abusive and over the top chef.  It is fun to watch him swagger.  As a couple these two seem to really enjoy each other's company and they have a lot of fun when together.  In all, this is another very good Korean love story.",1426204800,,1020,4.17948717948718
