3176445,5,B00180R03Q,"I ordered this DVD, and, after watching it, I have to say that it's actually better than the first. The animated re-enactments, coupled with the rich story-telling, were off-the-hook; and the street, as well as common sense, smarts Cosby demonstrates is riveting: you can't stop watching him, once you've started. His firsthand account of Griselda's history, her upbringing, her power, is communicated via a very simple approach, almost like listening to a friend tell a story, but it works. Having grown up in the ""hood,"" seen the power, and destruction, created by drugs, and those associated with them, this story definitely hits home.",1217894400,2,638,5.203883495145631

3176472,4,B00180R03Q,"I actually found it incredibly interesting. Mainly thanks to Charles Cosby who is incredibly articulate, detailed and intelligent in his narration. He explains how he caught a story on tv about a woman known as 'The Godmother', Griselda Blanco -the most notorious and violent drug kingpin that ever lived. When Cosby was a teenager, Blanco controlled the biggest drug cartel in the world, and most certainly because of that he was extremely attracted to Blanco and became completely intoxicated by her life. He began writing her letters after she was eventually incarcerated in prison. So Cosby and Blanco formed a close relationship and Cosby visited her in prison often. He began to look out for Blanco's family members. From this time on Cosby rose in power to become one of the most successful drug dealers in history. To look at Cosby and to hear such articulation and intelligence, it is difficult to understand what the atraction was in Blanco except for the lust for money and power. Blanco is said to have contracted more than 200 murders over a period of 30 years. Cosby narrates through the entire film beginging with Blanco's days as a child, to her rise in power, and her eventual downfall, and shares his own experiences with Blanco as well as his own rise and fall. To look at Cosby now it is nearly impossible to believe he was part of such a brutal regime. Cosby lives today as a free man, which I find suprising considering that he himself admits to eventually becoming one of the highest ranking members of 'The Godmother's' violent and massive drug cartel. It's great that he has turned his life around and lives respectable and upstanding citizen now. He is a very lucky man to say the least, because by all rights he should have been serving a life sentence, which leaves us to wonder what has become of our judicial systems in America.",1367971200,3,1858,4.737654320987654

3176482,5,B00180R03Q,"If you have seen Cocaine Cowboys you have to have this one at first i was skeptical but this one takes off right from the start! It goes more in depth into the personal and professional life of  ""The Godmother"" and introduces us to west coast baller Charles Cosby!

3176483,5,B00180R03Q,"You can't compare CC1 to CC2. That's like trying to compare Alien to Aliens. They are completely different movies. CC1 was more fun to watch but CC2 is more intense and riveting. Yes, we learned much of the information by listening to one person talk. But if you really listen to Cosby, his story feels authentic and is mesmerizing. His claims are supported by witnesses. He and his friends are in no way 'stupid'. Think about where they came from. They came from the streets of Oakland. That they speak as well as they do is pretty incredible. And some of the stuff they say is powerful, not to mention hilarious. Charles Cosby seems to prattle on about GB until the moment you hear, ""She was the badest b**** to ever take a breath of life."" He said it so quickly in the middle of a long exposition that you can miss it. But if you stop and think about what he said... that simple sentence encapsulates the frightfulness of Griselda Blanco better than anything in CC1.",1353974400,,969,4.480225988700565
3176484,5,B00180R03Q,"Its an interesting movie. I watched this before I even watched the first one. Couldn't find the first one anywhere until I subsribed to prime. Its a very intriguing movie. The relationship between charles and giselda is interesting, when he met her he was in his early 20s, she was in her 50s and fell in love. This story depicts how cold giselda was and left a fearful and lasting impression of her. Jorge Rivi makes the documnetary imo, being giselda right hand man, he had much more personal and interesting stories to tell rather than charles who was at the tail end of her cocaine run.

The first one is the best one, it was more at depth, They spoke with former defense lawyers of giselda,rivi, fellow police offers, drug traffickers(people paid to smuggle drugs in the country), the in depth look at the hit squad of the columbia. intricate operations, miami in the 70s and 80s etc.",1345075200,,889,4.591194968553459
3176485,5,B00180R03Q,"It is almost criminal to suggest that ""Cocaine Cowboys 1""  was better than ""CC2"".
The reason why I say this is because Griselda Blanco is the most riveting figure in the whole ""CC"" saga. She's the top gun of all drug traffickers. Proof? She helped Pablo Escobar when he started out. Also, there is the ironic inter-racial relationship between Griselda and Charles Crosby. Then the second most riveting figure in the CC saga has to be the hitman Jorge ""Rivi"" Ayala. This man respected her more than anyone else in the documentary. It takes a lot for a stone cold killer to respect anyone but once they do, the person respected must be someone with character
more powerful than they have and that lady is Ms. Griselda Blanco. This lady won a gun battle with her husband and lived to tell about it. She's the top Boss Lady.
If you want to talk about manipulation, control and Machiavellian moves, no one in this saga was better than Griselda Blanco. If they ever made a movie about this documentary, IT WOULD BLOW SCARFACE OUT OF THE WATER!!!

3176487,1,B00180R03Q,"This movie fails in many ways but here are main ones

1)Its not Cocaine Cowboys. Its tries soooo hard to be like the first movie that it falls flat on its face.
2)Charles Cosby. Charles who? you may ask. the main character is unlikable and quite frankly not believable.
3)The story itself. I am sure there are parts that are real but I would venture to say alot of this junk is made up.
One the whole: unlike the first captivating movie this ""sequel"" is just a badly made rap video. There alot of segues that are blantant ripoffs of other movies-like the part Charles tells us the ""art"" of making crack--Cmon that almost right out of Menace to Society.",1321920000,,652,4.433333333333334

3176490,4,B00180R03Q,"This film is just as compelling and full of information as the first. I'll admit it is less comprehensive. But this film's power comes from its intimacy and its roots in street reality. You may not like Charles Cosby or his crowd, but this is who they were and what they did. They aren't the handsome white pilots, distributors and DEA agents who did all the talking in the original Cocaine Cowboys. If you can accept that, you'll enjoy this film and learn something about the early days of drug dealing in Oakland and towns like it. If you look closely at all the negative reviews here, you'll notice that most are written from a position of ignorance and superiority. These are the kind of people who voted for Reagan and the Bushes every time but won't admit it in public. A few are obvious racists, cop-lovers and Nancy Reagan style moralists. Mr. Cosby is not telling folks what they want to hear. He's keeping it real. He stretches the truth in places, but he was no doubt there, wrapped in the arms of the deadliest female queenpin of all time. Ms. Griselda Blanco killed 250 people, including many of her lovers and husbands. This young man Cosby would visit her in prison to have sex with her. Cosby was a fearless young man who risked death and incarceration at every step. Criticizing him or any of this film's subjects for their ghetto ways and slang talk is like blaming tigers for having stripes and survival instincts. Those who think this film glorifies the drug trade should remember how Charles Cosby has turned his back on it and still lives in terror of Griselda's revenge.",1306800000,12,1593,4.5929824561403505
3176491,5,B00180R03Q,Cocaine Cowboys 2 is a great sequel to Cocaine Cowboys!! It picks up where Cocaine Cowboys leaves off and helps you to understand Griselda Blanco much better as a person. To know that she was involved with an African-American man is also intriguing. I found this DVD to be well documented and factual. Don't read all of the other comments posted here! This is a great sequel to Cocaine Cowboys and Charles Crosby did a great job in providing a lot of history behind Griselda Blanco that was not discussed in Cocaine Cowboys.

3176494,2,B00180R03Q,"Cocaine Cowboys II: the Godmother (2008) is a biographical work,
about a famous narcotics kingpin, Griselda Blanco (""GB""). She was
the USA representative of the Medellin cartel from the early 70's
to the 80's for powder distribution,  eventually forced to go solo
from rubbing her bosses the wrong way in South America one too many
times, and P Escobar being eliminated.

By virtue of being locked up in a FCI (Federal Correctional
Institution), GB made up her mind in selecting someone to delegate
oversee and expand current business operations, at her own level.

This trusted man, was Charles Anthony Cosby, based in in Brookfield
Village, Oakland, California, whom noone could match in terms of
the personal rapport and relationship he was able to establish with
GB.

This  allowed CC's status as a street narcotics dealer or clocker
to rise ever higher time and again, from the success demonstrated
in all aspects of operations and assignments, at length covering
NY, Virginia, Carolinas, LA and Seattle regions, to the point that
GB's gross was $50 mil/yr.

The film lays out the street-level violence, such as kidnappings,
robberies, shakedowns of dealers, drive by shootings, setups,
retaliation. Mayhem and rubout victims reach all ages, On the
streets, 65 hoodlums drop every month. The collection of illegal
debts is uncompromising, resulting in hits time and again.
Paradoxically, GB is said to have declined to repay lenders and
order hits. Contracts on people are common, reaching at times as
high as $1 mil per hoodlum, explaing why  owning a AR-180 rifle is
a minimum in protection.

The egomaniacal nature of the head honcho position is shown, in
rubouts being carried out as thoughtlessly and frequently as
chewing a pack of gum and spewing it. In excess of 250 hits are
said to be attributable to GB, a life-size bronze statue replica
existing, as well as  mansions, penthouses on luxury apartment
complexes, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Rolex, jewelry of all sorts,
apparel, etc.

The financial aspects are minimally touched upon, as Panamanian
banks  laundering the cash proceeds, and send it off  to Colombian
suppliers and interests.

The story goes into the psychological landscape of members, such as
kidnapping schemes to gain release from jail terms, the thinking of
hitmen, etc.

The intended audience of this work, is not the same as the first in
the series, this one clearly being  a notch below, as suggested by
ane actual recipe to transform powder into crack over 5 minutes, or
the laying out of logistics and deals and bridge financing on
consignments, profit margins. Figures advanced are 5 large a day, 1
mil per week in sales possibly 10 mil, for a 10% commission.
Another example is 5 kg generating $2 mil in sales over 3 weeks.

The movie wraps up suggesting GB is responsible for the import and
distibution and consumption by Americans of at least 300 tons of
powder, and over a billion in revenue over the 10 to 15 years she
ran operations.",1270944000,,2974,4.965725806451613
3176495,3,B00180R03Q,"While Hustlin' with the Godmother is by no means a five-star documentary like Cocaine Cowboys, the reviews of one and two stars are overly critical.  They don't market it as a Miami drug war documentary, they promote the DVD for what it is: the relationship between Charles Cosby and Griselda Blanco.  In that respect, it's a solid documentary that gives you a more detailed look at the life of the Godmother, and how Cosby made it snow in Oakland.

Hustlin' with the Godmother can't hold a candle to the original Cocaine Cowboys DVD.  But then again, most drug documentaries don't either.  You'll appreciate CC2 if you approach it as it's own documentary about a guy who goes from being a small-time dealer, to an instant millionaire with the most deadly woman in the game.

There are several things that I really appreciated about the DVD.  The first is that stories are re-enacted through incredible animation sequences, which makes for great visuals.  The second is that you finally find out how Griselda's enforcer Rivi sank the original trial against the Godmother.  And third, the introduction of ""The Real Scarface"" theme by Bay Area rapper Ncredable, which Rakontur used for the DVD.

There must be some exaggeration of course. It's because most of the movie was based on interviews with drug dealers. There's no way to verify most of their claims. However, that does not reduce the entertaining value of the film.

This is the first documentation I watched that used animation for scenes that are difficult to be re-enacted. That helped tremendously.

3410969,4,B00180R03Q,"I actually found it incredibly interesting. Mainly thanks to Charles Cosby who is incredibly articulate, detailed and intelligent in his narration. He explains how he caught a story on tv about a woman known as 'The Godmother', Griselda Blanco -the most notorious and violent drug kingpin that ever lived. When Cosby was a teenager, Blanco controlled the biggest drug cartel in the world, and most certainly because of that he was extremely attracted to Blanco and became completely intoxicated by her life. He began writing her letters after she was eventually incarcerated in prison. So Cosby and Blanco formed a close relationship and Cosby visited her in prison often. He began to look out for Blanco's family members. From this time on Cosby rose in power to become one of the most successful drug dealers in history. To look at Cosby and to hear such articulation and intelligence, it is difficult to understand what the atraction was in Blanco except for the lust for money and power. Blanco is said to have contracted more than 200 murders over a period of 30 years. Cosby narrates through the entire film beginging with Blanco's days as a child, to her rise in power, and her eventual downfall, and shares his own experiences with Blanco as well as his own rise and fall. To look at Cosby now it is nearly impossible to believe he was part of such a brutal regime. Cosby lives today as a free man, which I find suprising considering that he himself admits to eventually becoming one of the highest ranking members of 'The Godmother's' violent and massive drug cartel. It's great that he has turned his life around and lives respectable and upstanding citizen now. He is a very lucky man to say the least, because by all rights he should have been serving a life sentence, which leaves us to wonder what has become of our judicial systems in America.",1367971200,3,1858,4.737654320987654

CC1 was more fun to watch but CC2 is more intense and riveting. Yes, we learned much of the information by listening to one person talk. But if you really listen to Cosby, his story feels authentic and is mesmerizing. His claims are supported by witnesses. He and his friends are in no way 'stupid'. Think about where they came from. They came from the streets of Oakland. That they speak as well as they do is pretty incredible. And some of the stuff they say is powerful, not to mention hilarious. Charles Cosby seems to prattle on about GB until the moment you hear, ""She was the badest b**** to ever take a breath of life."" He said it so quickly in the middle of a long exposition that you can miss it. But if you stop and think about what he said... that simple sentence encapsulates the frightfulness of Griselda Blanco better than anything in CC1.",1353974400,,969,4.480225988700565
3410981,5,B00180R03Q,"Its an interesting movie. I watched this before I even watched the first one. Couldn't find the first one anywhere until I subsribed to prime. Its a very intriguing movie. The relationship between charles and giselda is interesting, when he met her he was in his early 20s, she was in her 50s and fell in love. This story depicts how cold giselda was and left a fearful and lasting impression of her. Jorge Rivi makes the documnetary imo, being giselda right hand man, he had much more personal and interesting stories to tell rather than charles who was at the tail end of her cocaine run.

The first one is the best one, it was more at depth, They spoke with former defense lawyers of giselda,rivi, fellow police offers, drug traffickers(people paid to smuggle drugs in the country), the in depth look at the hit squad of the columbia. intricate operations, miami in the 70s and 80s etc.",1345075200,,889,4.591194968553459
3410982,5,B00180R03Q,"It is almost criminal to suggest that ""Cocaine Cowboys 1""  was better than ""CC2"".
The reason why I say this is because Griselda Blanco is the most riveting figure in the whole ""CC"" saga. She's the top gun of all drug traffickers. Proof? She helped Pablo Escobar when he started out. Also, there is the ironic inter-racial relationship between Griselda and Charles Crosby. Then the second most riveting figure in the CC saga has to be the hitman Jorge ""Rivi"" Ayala. This man respected her more than anyone else in the documentary. It takes a lot for a stone cold killer to respect anyone but once they do, the person respected must be someone with character
more powerful than they have and that lady is Ms. Griselda Blanco. This lady won a gun battle with her husband and lived to tell about it. She's the top Boss Lady.
If you want to talk about manipulation, control and Machiavellian moves, no one in this saga was better than Griselda Blanco. If they ever made a movie about this documentary, IT WOULD BLOW SCARFACE OUT OF THE WATER!!!

3)The story itself. I am sure there are parts that are real but I would venture to say alot of this junk is made up.

3410987,4,B00180R03Q,"This film is just as compelling and full of information as the first. I'll admit it is less comprehensive. But this film's power comes from its intimacy and its roots in street reality. You may not like Charles Cosby or his crowd, but this is who they were and what they did. They aren't the handsome white pilots, distributors and DEA agents who did all the talking in the original Cocaine Cowboys. If you can accept that, you'll enjoy this film and learn something about the early days of drug dealing in Oakland and towns like it. If you look closely at all the negative reviews here, you'll notice that most are written from a position of ignorance and superiority. These are the kind of people who voted for Reagan and the Bushes every time but won't admit it in public. A few are obvious racists, cop-lovers and Nancy Reagan style moralists. Mr. Cosby is not telling folks what they want to hear. He's keeping it real. He stretches the truth in places, but he was no doubt there, wrapped in the arms of the deadliest female queenpin of all time. Ms. Griselda Blanco killed 250 people, including many of her lovers and husbands. This young man Cosby would visit her in prison to have sex with her. Cosby was a fearless young man who risked death and incarceration at every step. Criticizing him or any of this film's subjects for their ghetto ways and slang talk is like blaming tigers for having stripes and survival instincts. Those who think this film glorifies the drug trade should remember how Charles Cosby has turned his back on it and still lives in terror of Griselda's revenge.",1306800000,12,1593,4.5929824561403505

3410991,2,B00180R03Q,"Cocaine Cowboys II: the Godmother (2008) is a biographical work,
about a famous narcotics kingpin, Griselda Blanco (""GB""). She was
the USA representative of the Medellin cartel from the early 70's
to the 80's for powder distribution,  eventually forced to go solo
from rubbing her bosses the wrong way in South America one too many
times, and P Escobar being eliminated.

By virtue of being locked up in a FCI (Federal Correctional
Institution), GB made up her mind in selecting someone to delegate
oversee and expand current business operations, at her own level.

This trusted man, was Charles Anthony Cosby, based in in Brookfield
Village, Oakland, California, whom noone could match in terms of
the personal rapport and relationship he was able to establish with
GB.

This  allowed CC's status as a street narcotics dealer or clocker
to rise ever higher time and again, from the success demonstrated
in all aspects of operations and assignments, at length covering
NY, Virginia, Carolinas, LA and Seattle regions, to the point that
GB's gross was $50 mil/yr.

The film lays out the street-level violence, such as kidnappings,
robberies, shakedowns of dealers, drive by shootings, setups,
retaliation. Mayhem and rubout victims reach all ages, On the
streets, 65 hoodlums drop every month. The collection of illegal
debts is uncompromising, resulting in hits time and again.
Paradoxically, GB is said to have declined to repay lenders and
order hits. Contracts on people are common, reaching at times as
high as $1 mil per hoodlum, explaing why  owning a AR-180 rifle is
a minimum in protection.

The egomaniacal nature of the head honcho position is shown, in
rubouts being carried out as thoughtlessly and frequently as
chewing a pack of gum and spewing it. In excess of 250 hits are
said to be attributable to GB, a life-size bronze statue replica
existing, as well as  mansions, penthouses on luxury apartment
complexes, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Rolex, jewelry of all sorts,
apparel, etc.

The financial aspects are minimally touched upon, as Panamanian
banks  laundering the cash proceeds, and send it off  to Colombian
suppliers and interests.

The story goes into the psychological landscape of members, such as
kidnapping schemes to gain release from jail terms, the thinking of
hitmen, etc.

The intended audience of this work, is not the same as the first in
the series, this one clearly being  a notch below, as suggested by
ane actual recipe to transform powder into crack over 5 minutes, or
the laying out of logistics and deals and bridge financing on
consignments, profit margins. Figures advanced are 5 large a day, 1
mil per week in sales possibly 10 mil, for a 10% commission.
Another example is 5 kg generating $2 mil in sales over 3 weeks.

The movie wraps up suggesting GB is responsible for the import and
distibution and consumption by Americans of at least 300 tons of
powder, and over a billion in revenue over the 10 to 15 years she
ran operations.",1270944000,,2974,4.965725806451613
3410992,3,B00180R03Q,"While Hustlin' with the Godmother is by no means a five-star documentary like Cocaine Cowboys, the reviews of one and two stars are overly critical.  They don't market it as a Miami drug war documentary, they promote the DVD for what it is: the relationship between Charles Cosby and Griselda Blanco.  In that respect, it's a solid documentary that gives you a more detailed look at the life of the Godmother, and how Cosby made it snow in Oakland.

Hustlin' with the Godmother can't hold a candle to the original Cocaine Cowboys DVD.  But then again, most drug documentaries don't either.  You'll appreciate CC2 if you approach it as it's own documentary about a guy who goes from being a small-time dealer, to an instant millionaire with the most deadly woman in the game.

There are several things that I really appreciated about the DVD.  The first is that stories are re-enacted through incredible animation sequences, which makes for great visuals.  The second is that you finally find out how Griselda's enforcer Rivi sank the original trial against the Godmother.  And third, the introduction of ""The Real Scarface"" theme by Bay Area rapper Ncredable, which Rakontur used for the DVD.

3411016,5,B00180R03Q,Watch the first movie then watch this one.  A great sequel that fills in a lot of the blanks.  Based totally on facts.  If you are into this kind of thing then I recommend it.,1236384000,,175,3.942857142857143
3411017,2,B00180R03Q,"CC2 really has nothing to do with Cocaine Cowboys except that Griselda Blanco is mentioned. CC2 is the glamorization of Charles Cosby's (who?) successful life of crime and his thug cronies. It's hardly a documentary and shouldn't be a sequel to CC1. If your looking for a follow up to the captivating, well written, well edited, and well produced CC1, this is not it. If you want a hour and a half long rap video to go along with your Scarface collection, have at it.",1233360000,10,467,4.5058823529411764
3411018,1,B00180R03Q,"This is the CHARLES COSBY story. Cosby was the lover of Blanco during and after her stay in prison, and nearly all of the story is told by him. VERY dubious credibility, and just plain dull. Cop ""The Godmother"" by Richard Smitten and skip this dreck.",1232150400,12,250,4.456521739130435
3411019,4,B00180R03Q,"This is a follow up the first Cocaine Cowboys. Griselda Blanco 'The Godmother' was a very popular figure in the first movie and people wanted to know more about her. The sequel covers Charles Cosby's relationship with the Godmother and goes into her bio a bit. Although the documentary is good, it is not as good as the first Cocaine Cowboys. I was expecting to learn more than I already knew but I didn't. It's still worth watching, especially if you want to know more about Griselda Blanco. As always with Billy Corben movies, make sure you go through all the extras on the DVD and watch again with the commentary on.",1231804800,,619,4.535714285714286
3411020,4,B00180R03Q,Fascinating detail of the Godmother's criminal and personal actions throughout the 80's and 90's.  The only thing missing was a live shot of her after her deportation from the US.  Would love to see how she's living now.  Exceptional footage of Dade County during the days of the Cocaine Cowboys - wonderful documentary.,1224547200,,320,5.0
3411021,5,B00180R03Q,"A Great true story. I have watched this movie over and over. Everyone who watches it has their eyes glued to the screen. It's the only sequel I saw that you didn't have to see the first one to follow part 2. The godmother is the real scarface. I liked how the movie showed her dangerous cut throat side. As well as her softer side, how she loved her children and charles cosby. This is the best documentary I have ever seen. I liked the music in the movie especially the theme song real scarface by ncredable. I hope they make a video for it that would be cool! I found the whole song at myspace.com/ncredable",1222473600,,609,4.258620689655173
3411022,4,B00180R03Q,"It contains a lot of strange and riveting revelations. For example, it showed how the actions of the two secretaries helped Charles Cosby escape prosecution for drug trafficking. It's like the stuff from a Best Selling Novel. I could never have thought of it!

There must be some exaggeration of course. It's because most of the movie was based on interviews with drug dealers. There's no way to verify most of their claims. However, that does not reduce the entertaining value of the film.

This is the first documentation I watched that used animation for scenes that are difficult to be re-enacted. That helped tremendously.

No wonder some people want to sell drugs. They can become millionaire in a very short time. LIFE is  indeed STRANGER than FICTION.",1222387200,,759,4.90625
3411023,4,B00180R03Q,"This time we got to know the ""godmother"" up close and personal, if hollywood slept on the first installment i guranntee they'll jump on this one(if the bootleggers don't beat'um to the punch) But solid story line front to back. I must say ""godmother"" was indeed a very complex individual",1220572800,,287,4.76
3411024,4,B00180R03Q,"I enjoyed the movie alot. If you were a fan of the first movie you would like it very much.  I thought that they could have had more interveiws with different people to give it a different perspective, but the movie was still enjoyable and picked up well from where the first movie left off.",1220227200,,291,4.290909090909091
3411025,4,B00180R03Q,"I looked at the original over and over again, saying ""I'm going To Rent You Next Time I Come In"". Well today was that day. I just watched CC2, and people let me tell you. This documentary, was off the hook, VERY GOOD. Story WELL TOLD. So after watching CC2. I rushed out to get the original. I wanted to write this review before watching CC1. After this review, I'm gonna buy my own copy right here from amazon. This movie is well worth the price. Better than ANY HOOD MOVIE you've ever saw. Why? Because it's REAL. I hope there is a CC3 that only gets better. WONDERFUL MOVIE, WONDERFUL MOVIE,.",1217980800,,595,4.321428571428571
