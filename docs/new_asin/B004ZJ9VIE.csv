4509214,2,B004ZJ9VIE,"Some good combat footage, brought me back to Baghdad watching it but that's all it has going for it. The last segment, ""Baghdad Happens"" was cheesy as hell and looked Ameriprise which is sad because there was some actual good footage there but for some reason they added the cheesiest, most cartoonish music they could find in the back ground. I payed $5 for it so I guess I can't complain too much though.",1383350400,4,406,4.5
4509215,5,B004ZJ9VIE,"Fantastic doco. Much more understanding these boys go through tho keep the faith ! i doubt if the average civilian knows how they put thier lives on the line, my heart goes out to all of them, both retired and serving, and sure as hell hope they all get back safely in thier latest postings...

4509217,4,B004ZJ9VIE,"I liked this documentary's fresh take.  It approaches the conflict not from the external perspective of the firefight, but rather from the internal perspective of the soldier fighting it.  In short, it's not war porn.  While I've never been a soldier and don't know what a war or firefight is actually like, I suspect I can learn a lot more about them by listening to a combat veteran tell me about them than from watching battle scenes unfold.  It's like watching a sporting event that you don't understand: you can see what, but you can't see why.  This documentary filled that gap nicely for me.",1347494400,7,598,4.6571428571428575
4509218,1,B004ZJ9VIE,"Could only make it half way through this dvd, interview after interview after interview.........why travel to Afghanistan to sit down and talk?

The cover and description leads viewers to believe it contains real footage ""outside the wire"" but after 2hrs of viewing I turned it off.

Much better dvd's out there, Ross Kemp in Afghanistan, The battle for Marjah etc.........",1319587200,6,373,5.2

4509247,4,B004ZJ9VIE,"I'm giving the interviews and what the military heroes (interviewees) put into this series five stars. These guys are on the front lines and deserve 6 out of 5 stars. However, I have to give the series 4 out of 5 stars as a whole. Here's why. This production is pretty low budget and is poorly shot and captured. Many interviews look like 1980s era quality. Other combat cam footage provides so much better quality and gives you the sense of ""being there"" with detailed realism. Less the heat and smells. Oh... and getting shot at. As some other reviewers mentioned the last episode of Baghdad Happens is entirely cheesy and just totally out of place. The narrator in his suit and sunglasses trying to act like the mission was all about him comes off as being all about me and ""my story"" rather than about the soldiers. His being a former Marine only makes me shake my head in wonder. The best series are the ones in which he is narrating the least. He's too scripted and it takes away from the soldier's story. There's also a lot of repeat footage perhaps to act as filler so expect to see a lot of footage recycled. If you are somebody interested in seeing a lot of combat footage you won't find it here. If you are somebody who is interested in really seeing what the day to day life was like winning the hearts and minds in the Surge, the interviews are great. Are they boring? Compared to combat footage yes. Think of the interviews as the yang to the adrenaline rush ying of combat. Completely boring. However, it's that ""boring"" content that makes Outside the Wire so awesome. Hearing the strategy of company commanders, platoon leaders, etc. and the efforts taken to fight insurgency is simply amazing and fascinating. Hearing their interviews really brings to light the achievements being made to win in Iraq (at the time of Surge). On a side note this is all OIF - not Afghanistan as another negative reviewer mentioned. To wrap up this review I also want to point out the very haunting interviews from episodes Danger Close and Anbar Awakens. This alone is worth the DVD. If you listen carefully to interviews about AQIZ and ISIS you'll shine some light towards the current situation in Iraq as we wind down 2014. All that blood and sacrifice. Just watch and you'll see. Aside from the narrator, low budget, and awful cheese in Baghdad Happens this is worth watching to learn more on counter-insurgency strategy. To sum it up - if you want lots of combat footage this isn't for you. If you want small amounts of combat footage mixed with exceptional insight on the Surge this is for you. Just don't expect high quality footage.",1417564800,7,2638,4.591101694915254
