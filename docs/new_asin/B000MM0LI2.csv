Many of us think in order to get into shape we need the expensive workout equipment or gym memberships. Well they are good, but they tend not to be worth the money. This dvd set will have you on a consistent workout that will get you into great shape. Just a few times a week and you will see the difference in your overall health from your endurance to strength. I really enjoy this workout dvd and I couldn't beat the price. Stop with all the expensive unnecessary workout equipment, pop this dvd in and work with Sugar Ray Leonard and Laila Ali. Trust me it is worth it.",1208995200,7,710,4.266666666666667
2736826,5,B000MM0LI2,"I was very impressed with this workout DVD. I didn't know what to expect from two professional boxers.  It's more ""body friendly"" than a Billy Blanks workout.  Laila Ali does a fantastic job in leading the workout and you will work up a sweat!  The music is good and the ab routine is thorough - slow and precise. She gives very good nutrition advice at the end.  Sugar Ray gives a very good motivational talk at the end as well.

I'm glad to have it as part of my physical fitness collection!",1186358400,5,493,4.315217391304348
2736827,5,B000MM0LI2,"I enjoyed this workout very much. It's a nice pace excellent for someone who loves boxing and needs a good workout as well as someone looking to learn some basic boxing moves.

The workout is about 30 minutes and includes both upper and lower body exercises followed by a core floorwork drill. You will be ready to end when your 30 minutes are up but you'll also be energized and ready for the next session. They recommend 2-3 days per week.

They have a short nutritional advice segment with Laila and a motivational segment with Sugar Ray. I think that added a more personal touch to this dvd. If you are skeptical about paying $15+ for this workout remember it can be rented from Netflix and the likes to try out.

Micheal Olajide, Jr. also offers boxing workouts that are of benefit.",1179532800,25,787,4.528169014084507
8169879,3,B000MM0LI2,"I guess I'm the odd man out when it comes to this product. It's a neat little workout but not all that well put together or informative. Of course you don't need a complete boxing run down to learn how to throw basic jabs; hooks and uppercuts, but teaching the correct fundamentals of HOW to throw these punches is very important. Not only do they not show you how to throw a proper punch, they themselves don't even throw their punches correctly in this DVD. They basically teach you to flail your arms forward as if you're about to hit something but they don't tell you how to shift your body-weight into a shot to maximize your punches effectiveness, plus they treat every punch as if they're all thrown the same way. Which they're not supposed to be... I do like that they implement footwork and movement in their workout, instead of just standing in one spot and throwing punches but the rest of the workout felt like I was back in my high school gym class. Just pretty much your basic jumping jacks; lunges, jog in place, etc.... I don't know, I guess I expected something a little better coming from two legends like Sugar Ray and Laila, but you could really find the same kind of workout in any old 99 cent bargain bin of other workout DVD's. I'm disappointed as far as the boxing aspect goes, but if you want to get off your couch for a change and do a little workout then you could definitely do worse.",1431734400,,1412,4.393129770992366

8169883,5,B000MM0LI2,"WOW!!
I was truly amazed at how wonderful this DVD and its trainers were! At first, I was a bit leary in purchasing it but, I took a chance and did.! I am so glad that I did! What a workout! Laila and Sugar Ray are great! I started out with the beginners DVD (will work my way up to Advanced) and boy did I work up a sweat!! I went to work feeling energized and motivated! Although the DVD is 30 minutes, this was a FULL body workout! It has been 3 weeks now and I already see results! I truly recommend this DVD. Along with eating right everyday and working out with Laila 3 times a week, you will see immediate results! Woo hoo!!",1303689600,,631,4.015873015873016
8169884,4,B000MM0LI2,i liked this workout video.  the people wern't too annoying and it was fun and went by fast.  I'd buy another video by them for sure,1302739200,,132,4.038461538461538
8169885,1,B000MM0LI2,This DVD is good in that it gets you up and moving. You will not learn how to box with this DVD. BUY THE EVERLAST DVDS with Michael Olajide.,1302048000,3,140,3.8620689655172415
8169886,5,B000MM0LI2,This was an excellent purchase.  The video is fabulous.  Easy to learn and you do get a workout because the moves are repetitive.,1288310400,,129,4.565217391304348
8169887,5,B000MM0LI2,"I love boxing.  Bored with conventional workout DVD's of buffed, oiled, impossibly good looking and mostly annoying personalities, I decided to try this.  The price was more than right and I thought why not?  Best inventment in myself I've made in years.  Besides one guy who creeps me out a little, the troup is appealing.  There is a chemistry between Laila and SRL that I like.  They are in phenomenal shape but they are not sticks.  The others are also appealing, a wide range of high energy to earnestness to low key - all the while showing you high-energy of accomodating versions of the work out.  They even make mistakes and laugh at each other, which I think is great.  I can actually see myself looking reasonably like them and I am getting there.

And it is not easy for me.  With several health issues high impact fat burning cardio is impossible with most home work-outs.  A gym and trainer is not possible and I was feeling out of shape and sluggish.  Since I've been using this, I've lost 5 net pounds, have not changed the way I eat, though I need to build more good and more food generally into my diet.  I am happiest about the inches I've lost, the waist I can see, all of my jeans have more room in the legs (I have huge thighs and calves overdeveloped from years of cycling that kind of went to mush, yuk).  I stand taller.  I look taller.  I feel better.  Nothing beats hammering out frustration with a good strong shadow box!

This is a definite.  If you are not a boxing fan, try it.  If you are one, buy this today!",1287792000,,1540,4.352112676056338
8169888,5,B000MM0LI2,"I love this dvd set!  I use wrist weights when doing the workouts, so i don't know if doing it without them is as tiring, but I know I am DEAD by the time I get done (with one let alone both).  SO worth the money! :)",1234828800,6,216,3.574468085106383
