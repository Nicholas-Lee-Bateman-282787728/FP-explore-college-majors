8179384,2,B00004SC9Z,"Can't add much more than the other reviewer did. The movie is so, so bad. I did give it two stars because in many scenes it's so bad it's quite funny. But don't watch it unless it's free (like through Prime). Even then, only if you're a sadist or appreciate really awful movies.",1355788800,,278,4.264150943396227
8179385,1,B00004SC9Z,"Amazon really needs to add a minus star in their ratings, there is nothing good I can say about this film.
Music score and volume sucked, extremely bad acting, the story/script was pointless and I don't think the director was even on the set. There was a foul mouth angry teen of course and a runaway teen that goes from one extreme to the next without reason. 30 minutes in I started nodding off and my fast forward button was well worn by the end. Even the makeup could have been done by a five year old.
Good luck enjoying this tripe. For those who are in it for the skin, there is some boob action but still not worth the crap you have to sit through to get there.",1355788800,,668,4.1461538461538465
8179386,1,B00004SC9Z,"<strong>The Laughing Dead</strong> (Somtow Sucharitkul, 1989)

Somtow Sucharitkul is better-known to horror novel fans as S. P. Somtow, author of a number of well-received novels (the best-known of which is probably <em>Vampire Junction</em>). He's a good writer, and what I have read of his work I have enjoyed a great deal.

And then there is <em>The Laughing Dead</em>, Sucharitkul's (thankfully) only foray into film directing, which offers us hard evidence that competence in one medium does not guarantee competence in other media in any way, shape, or form. Since I watched this abomination, I have been trying to come up with something I can compare it to. Nothing works. <em>Exorcist II: The Heretic</em> is better than this. <em>Spiker</em> is better than this. <em>Mustang Sally</em> is better than this. It's a little better than <em>Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie</em>, but only a little. And <em>Zombies Ate My Neighbours: The Movie</em> is the worst movie ever made that does not star Hugh Grant.

I would give you a plot synopsis, but that would be overlaying some semblance of coherence onto this mess. It involves Aztecs, zombies, and Aztec zombies, as well as a priest and his former girlfriend, who I think may have been an ex-nun but could never be certain. And some stereotypical boorish American tourists who I think were supposed to be played for laughs right up until they were offed in tiringly unoriginal ways (and, in most cases, afterwards as well). It also involves a cameo from Sucharitkul as a mad scientist who moonlights as a piano player at a hotel bar. I kid you not. (He's also a noted composer.)

""Murky"" is a good description of not only the plot, but the camerawork (it doesn't help that the movie's been out of print for twenty years, so even if you find it now, you're going to be watching a long-degraded VHS tape). It might also be applicable to the acting, but ""murky"" would give you a sunnier picture of the acting than should actually be presented. It's downright terrible. Most of these folks never acted in another movie, and for good reason. I can't even recommend this as a terrible-movie drinking game, it's that bad. Avoid at all costs.

8179387,4,B00004SC9Z,"Its a pearl between all the Horror-trash!
The story about a priest who lost his trust in god & fight against a demon is fine.
Filming of a bestseller-novel is never so good like the book,okay.
But this movie is good enough for your own horror-evening. There nice splatter-moments in it and the
actors are pretty good for a b-picture.
Taste this little Horror-treasure,it'll be fun.",1311033600,3,381,4.787878787878788
