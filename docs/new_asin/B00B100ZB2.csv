The price of the DVD is worth every penny for the scene in Follow A Star, with Richard Wattis as the psychiatrist and Wisdom regressing first to 18 months of age and then pulling off a 5 year old - pure comic genius at its best.",1454284800,,264,4.3
8560454,3,B00B100ZB2,"I have to give a lot of credit to the folks at VCI who have been re-issuing lots of DVDs from the British distributor The Rank Organisation. They've remastered the prints and they look great. This is the fourth ""double-feature"" DVD that they have issued of British comedian Norman Wisdom made in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The black and white print is pristine and the 1:33.1/4x3 screen aspect is the original.
I wanted to watch the first film, ""Follow A Star"" first, because of its musical numbers. Wisdom actually wrote two of the three songs. At first Wisdom reminded me of George Formby (actual name George Formby Jr.) who made some really funny British musical comedies in the late 1930s. But I found Formby was less slapstick than Wisdom and actually could sing well. He had many hit records. After the first 10 minutes the comedy - while physical - started to remind me of the  Three Stooges. Comedy is subjective and if the Stooges are your idea of funny then you'll probably like the Windom films a lot.
I started to watch the second film here but, again, the comedy was a bit too broad for me.

The DVD comes with a ""photo gallery"" for each of the films, which is a 2  minute ""slide show"" with music of advertising stills and other promotional materials related to the film.
So, while I'm giving the DVD 3 stars, it's just my opinion. I still applaud the VCI folks for making these ""double features"" available and I'm especially looking forward to their reissuing more of the Jessie Matthews (great British singing comedienne from the 1930s) later this year.
I hope this review was both informative and helpful.
