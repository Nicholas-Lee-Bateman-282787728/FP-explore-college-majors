8325002,5,B000CCXLFW,"This is a delightful light comedy from the late 40s that I used to see occasionally on the late show in the 60s.  It has virtually dropped out of sight in recent decades, so chances are you have not seen it.  The young Louis Jourdan is great as a neurotic artist who causes some jealous friction with Lili Palmer's husband, Dana Andrews.  But this film has gone the way of other great films, which used to see air-time, such as another Lili Palmer film, ""The Four Poster"" with Rex Harrison.  It is really horrible when I discuss films like this and other people not only have never heard of them, but don't even know the actors in them!",1220227200,3,636,4.364406779661017
