8599895,5,B00E0RCTEY,"Fate/Zero surprised me by creating larger-than-life, emotionally-convincing characters.  This is an especially admirable feat, considering that the main characters consist of such historical and legendary personalities as Gilles de Rais, Arthur(ia) Pendragon, Alexander the Great, and Gilgamesh.  While the characters do not truly adhere to their historical personalities, the show manages to recreate them in such a fun and energetic fashion that it really doesn't matter: one ends up believing in even the most absurd of propositions (that King Arthur was female, for instance, or that Alexander the Great was eight feet tall).

The plot and action sequences are excellent, and the show makes good use of CGI, without being indulgent.  If you're looking for a good character-driven action-fantasy, I highly recommend it.",1386460800,2,822,5.658536585365853
