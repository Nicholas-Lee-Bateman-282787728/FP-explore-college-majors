8538147,5,B0099PW0KK,"I bought this elsewhere, which is why this isn't a ""verified"" review.

This is a two-disc DVD set.  On the first disk, you can insert it into a computer and print off three PDFs:  an eight-page recipe booklet, a one-page dosha explanation, and a one-page calendar plan of putting it all together.  It also includes very short videos on abyenga (body oiling), using a neti pot, nasya (oil in the nose) and Uddiyana bandha.  There are three yoga practices on this disc:  standing and back bending sequence; standing poses and forward folds; and standing vinyasa flow (very nice, no music).  On the second disc, there are four practices, I think.

This is a really set.  I wish it came with a book, but it probably kept the production costs down to put the printable PDFs on the discs, instead of making a booklet.

Even though this says it's a detox to prepare for the fall, you can do this anytime of the year, including a change of seasons, a home vacation, anytime you need to renew yourself, etc.

This is from Yoga Journal, so I expected it to be well done, and it is.",1495584000,,1071,4.469072164948454
8538148,5,B0099PW0KK,So far this is my favorite new DVD.  Kind of makes you think beyond just the movement and more about how the mental side works in hand with the physical movement.  Easy to follow and very well done.,1358208000,,198,4.184210526315789
