8275164,3,B0019SE2JC,"[SO YOUNG, SO LOVELY, SO VICIOUS - (1975) - Directed by Silvio Amadio - Widescreen presentation] Usually listed (and incorrectly so) as a gaillo, this film has more in common with trashy soap operas than the black-gloved, fetishistic serial killings of Bava, Argento, Sergio and Luciano Martino, Freda or their kin. It's actually a coarse retelling of Otto Preminger's excellent 'Bonjour Tristesse', minus any of the estimable aspects of that film, and should be avoided by all except stalwart fans of Gloria Guida and Dagmar Lassander.

Angela (Gloria Guida), fresh out of high school, picks up her father from the airport, whom she hasn't seen in a year, and finds out he's planning on remarrying a woman named Irene (Dagmar Lassander) very soon. This doesn't sit well with Angela, and she does everything she can to insure that this union never sees fruition. She has her boyfriend attempt seducing her to no avail and then, after digging into Irene's past and finding mental abuse traumas stemming from a former lesbian relationship, decides she'll seduce Irene herself. This takes up three-quarters of the film, though we do see Gloria naked constantly insuring we never get too bored (truth be told, this doesnt work out nearly as well as you'd think), and Dagmar looks great in several of her costumes/outfits, but never gets undressed (somehow, as demented as this sounds, this makes her sexier as a result).

When the Sapphic session between the older woman and the nubile girl finally does take place on a secluded beach setting, it's photographed by Angela's boyfriend to be utilized as a blackmail tool afterwards. As you'd expect, Angela has a sudden change of heart upon realizing Irene isn't the witch she once believed and now wants the negatives destroyed, Irene regrets the tryst and decides she must leave at once for the good of all concerned, but the boyfriend needs cash and still wants to go through with the blackmail. Irene is pushed beyond the breaking point, and the predictable tragedy results.

A tawdry, sleazy 70's soap, this flick has precious little going for it apart from the soft-core elements, of which there are more than a fair share, but still somehow left me cold. And I have a high tolerance for the tedious when it comes to exploitation from the 70's. Recommended to hard-core Gloria Guida fans only. So young, so lovely, and oh so boring... 2 1/2 stars.",1373414400,2,2397,4.91358024691358
