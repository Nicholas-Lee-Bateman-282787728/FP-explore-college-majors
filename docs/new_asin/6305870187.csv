1090701,4,6305870187,"I was a little cynical when I first saw this movie as I'd seen the show done on stage and had been really disappointed with the last Annie produced in the 80's, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I watched this with my  four-year old daughter and she loved it.  The acting was great.  Kathy  Bates, as usual, was wonderful.  The little girl did a wonderful job as  Annie and all the musical numbers were fun.  This 1999 version lacked some  of the stunts that made the previous movie unbelievable.  It was sincere  and stuck to the original play very well.  My daughter loved it and after  one viewing was mopping my kitchen floor singing ""Hard Knock  Life.""",945129600,32,656,4.495726495726496

I love the cast. You can tell they were all hand picked and fit the rolls perfectly. They all wanted to be in the film and acted effortlessly.

Annie was a great choice. She not only had spunk, but her ability to change emotions and still keep her happy spirit alive was great.

As this is more of a musical, the singing was to notch. All of the singers were able to hit their notes spot on with feeling.

I have seen many versions of Annie and something was always missing but this version was great. I was able to feel the emotions of Annie as she searched for her parents and the disappointment she felt when she learned for their fate.

Miss Hanigan played her roll well. Her dislike for Annie was clear yet she managed to stick in some comical lines that got the audience laughing.

Mr. Warbucks well he was just emotionless and perfect. I love how he did not want anything to do with Annie and as the film progresses, he kept his high profile demeanor, but softened up.

What can I say this is one of the best Annie's on the market. If you are an Annie Fan, check this one out.",1438128000,,1162,4.137777777777778

1091789,5,6305870187,"Things were tough all over in the 1930's. That's especially true if you're an orphan. Just ask Annie (Alicia Morton). She lives in an orphanage in New York City run by the evil Miss Hannigan (Kathy Bates). Annie was left on the doorstep of the orphanage when she was a baby, and all she dreams of is the day her parents will return to claim her.

This year for Christmas, Oliver Warbucks (Victor Garber), the billionaire, has decided to invite one orphan to his mansion for Christmas. Through a series of events, Annie is selected. After he comes to care for her, Warbucks starts a search for Annie parents. But when Miss Hannigan gets wind of the reward, she gets involved in a plan to swindle Warbucks and kidnap Annie. Can she be stopped?

I've gotten to see this musical a couple times in local productions, and I just love it. It's just plain fun. Unfortunately, the original movie version lost that fun somewhere along the way. I've never liked it. But that's a review for another day. This version sticks much closer to the stage play and is better off for it.

With only an hour and a half, the film at times feels like it's moving from one musical number to another. This is especially true near the beginning. But the songs develop the characters, so it is helping advance the story. Since the movie is much shorter then the stage play, the story moves fast and really never lags.

A big part of the success of a musical to me is the song and dance numbers. With such classics as ""Tomorrow"" and ""You're Never Fully Dressed without a Smile,"" the songs here are great. I often complain when a dance number sticks to one set and begins to feel more like a stage production. I never get that feeling while watching this movie, even though most of the songs do stay on one or two sets. ""NYC"" and ""I Think I'm Going to Like it Here"" are noticeable exceptions and fun numbers that make great use of the movie format.

The cast here is wonderful. Newcomer Alicia Morton is perfect as Annie, perky and happy without being over the top sappy. I was worried about Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan, but she is perfect. And, frankly, I find her sober Miss Hannigan much more frightening then Carol Burnett's drunken version in the original movie. Rounding out the all-star cast are Alan Cumming, Audra McDonald, and Kristin Chenoweth. They're all great, but I especially love Kristin's Lilly St. Regis. I wish she'd had more screen time. As a fun bonus, Andrea McArdle, Broadway's original Annie, makes a cameo appearance during the ""NYC"" number.

The drawback to the movie is the cuts. To fit the two and a half hour play into 90 minutes, something had to go. Most of the historical background to the story is gone, including the song ""We'd Like to Thank You Mr. Hoover."" FDR is reduced to a cameo appearance as well. Additionally, Oliver Warbucks gets short changed on character development. He is never truly that gruff, so we don't notice a big change. Personally, I find these changes minor over all and they hardly dampen my enjoyment.

I have watched this version of Annie countless times, and I always have a smile on my face for the entire 90 minutes. This is a great version of a fun musical suitable for the entire family to enjoy together.",1433808000,,3244,4.544520547945205
1091790,4,6305870187,"This is a made for tv version of the broadway musical annie... But is my granddaughter's favorite version. The lead is adorable as Annie and worth watching. Some of the adult leads are not as good as those in the earlier movie (seriously, though...

1092607,1,6305870187,"Since the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie/dp/B0000VCZKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie</a>&nbsp;was released in 1982, I grew up watching that version, and for the most part LOVED it! But still, I was looking forward to the remake, especially when I heard that Kathy Bates would be playing the role of the Ms. Hannigan, the villainous orphanage director.

I thought Kathy Bates would be FANTASTIC as Ms. Hannigan, and she was. Unfortunately, as great as she is/was, she is not enough to pull of this movie by herself. Because with the exception of Kathy Bates, the rest of the casting was AWFUL!

Although Alicia Morton (who played Annie) is cute, she just does NOT hold a candle to Aileen Quinn of the original 1982 version. While Aileen was nowhere near as adorable as Alicia, the character of Annie is supposed to be feisty, street-smart, sassy and tomboyish -- NONE of which Alicia can pull off successfully. But the casting of Alicia is nowhere near as bad as the HORRENDOUS casting of Audra McDonald as Grace Farrell, the secretary and later the love interest for Oliver Warbucks.

Now I am all for equality, justice and non-discrimination, and I absolutely abhor any kind of bigotry, racism & prejudice, but by the same token, there is also a lot to be said for being accurate and realistically true to history, especially when the setting of the work depicted is in past decades/centuries/millenniums. In all seriousness, in what world would an African-American woman be the personal secretary to a billionaire in the 1930s, let alone DATE him or marry him??

Ever heard of anti-miscegenation laws which CRIMINALIZED interracial marriages or relationships??

During the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American woman being in a position like that would unfortunately have NEVER have happened. It's sad & unfortunate but during those ""Jim Crow"" days, prior to the incredible work done by heroes like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X., Medgar Evers and others, the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and its slowly increasing acceptance, interracial marriage was forbidden and neither black men and especially not black women were allowed to be in any positions of power. As the saying went back then in those days, black women were relegated to being ""maids, mammies and mamas""! And what is it with casting Audra McDonald in every single remake?? She was also cast as the Mother Abbess in the recent live remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B00FWMVVLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>&nbsp;and she was awful, not to mention historically inaccurate, there as well!

This is NOT about either racism, multi-culturalism, or ""political correctness"" -- its about sheer historical inaccuracy, that stretches the limits of believability. Its like remaking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B00004RF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>, and recasting Scarlett O'Hara with a Chinese woman, Rhett Butler with an African-American, Ashley Wilkes with a Latino, Melanie Hamilton with a Native American, India Wilkes with a woman from India (and I say that being of Indian descent myself!) and Mammy & Prissy with fair-skinned, blue-eyed blondes! Because that's what the ridiculous casting in these remakes basically amounts to -- changing the cast's characteristics, simply for the sake of political correctness and multi-culturalism, and the truth of history be damned!

Unfortunately, the rest of the casting and acting in this movie is just as bad, if not worse!

While Victor Garber is a great actor, he is too stiff and wooden for this role. Nearly every character is unbearably annoying and petulant. Rather than being lovable and adorable like the kids at the orphanage (especially Molly) in the original movie were, the kids come off as total brats. From what I saw and remember (I couldn't get through more than even half of this movie) with possibly the exception of Kathy Bates as Ms. Hannigan there was not been one single character in this production that I liked.

What is it with everyone producing such AWFUL remakes of ALREADY-GREAT musicals & movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B009EELBIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie/dp/6305870187/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie</a>?? Why do they have to mess with perfection?!?

So many people are saying that this 1999 Disney version is so much better than the original, and I just do NOT get it!!

Despite having some of my favorite people - Bernadette Peters and Carol Burnett among them - that version was a big disappointment.  Perhaps it was the poor choice of a director: while John Huston (for younger people, Angelica's dad) was one of the great Hollywood directors of all time, his background was primarily in dramatic and adventure films, and he also did a Western or two.  ANNIE was Huston's first (and last) musical, and it showed, to disastrous effect, which may have been why the film did less-than-stellar business at the box office.

I saw this 1999 Disney version on ABC, and just recently purchased the DVD.  It is magnificent, and is everything the 1982 version was not, not only for the great songs and dances, but a marvelous cast: Victor Garber as Oliver ""Daddy"" Warbucks, Kathy Bates as the dastardly Miss Hannigan, Alicia Morton as Annie, Alan Cumming as the con artist Rooster (Miss Hannigan's brother), and two current favorites of mine: the adorable Kristin Chenoweth as Rooster's partner-in-crime Lily St. Regis, and the gorgeous Audra McDonald as Grace, Daddy Warbucks' secretary.  The original Broadway Annie, Andrea McArdle, makes a cameo appearance in the big production number, ""N.Y.C.,"" giving fans an added treat.

Except for 5.0 surround sound and the WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY trailer, there are no DVD extras, but this is the version to buy, above all others.

And now Will Smith wants to do a ""redux"" of this show for his daughter Willow (although I just found out that Willow has ""outgrown"" the role and will be replaced by the young Oscar-nominated actress, Quvenzhan Wallis).  A hip-hop Annie? With Jay-Z (Mr. Beyonc) doing the music? Oh, PUH-LEEZE.

From the reviews I have read it is more along the lines of the Broadway version, but for myself this entire film was a train wreck.  Comparing the acting between both film versions this one was pathetic.

1.  Vocally this one hurt my ears and made me cringe just like the bad American Idol auditions.  Some were oversung, some songs the speed it was sung seemed too slow, and it just wasn't enjoyable.  I enjoyed every performance in the 1982 version, this one just didn't cut it vocally which was a huge disappointment for myself.

2.  The acting lacked real emotion and feeling.  Again, granted I have never seen the Broadway show, but if it is anything like this movie, I'm glad I didn't.  Comparing both versions the 1982 version had the better cast and acting.  This one the acting was BLAH!  Alicia wasn't able to deliver the timing Aileen was which really hurt this movie.  Along with having Oliver Warbucks pretty much be accepting of Annie almost immediately with out putting up a big fuss when he was supposed to have a bad image.  Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, and the entire orphan cast was more enjoyable than anyone or anything in this version.

I'm just glad I only rented this instead of buying it.",1308182400,2,1387,4.558704453441296

My daughter was furious and begging to see annie again, so i did some reading of reviews here on amazon, and found this one-- the alicia morton/kathy bates version.  it's like night and day!  this one is much more true to the original broadway version-- alicia morton as annie is charming, adorable, a great singer-- tough and sweet, but not saccharin like aileen quinn.  the costumes and sets are charming, the musical arrangements are great, all the performances are strong, and it is great for young audiences.  i am usually not a fan of ""Disney-fied"" musicals-- but they did a GREAT job with this one.  and the andrea mcardle cameo was a huge treat for a fan like me.  hooray for annie!!

1093099,5,6305870187,"The familiar story is simple. In 1933 New York, a young eleven-year-old orphan named Annie is insistent that her parents are still alive, and she will stop at nothing to find them, even if the mean orphanage curator Miss Hannigan does try to stop her. At Christmas time, the billionaire Oliver Warbucks wants an orphan to stay at his house during the
Christmas season; Warbucks' secretary Grace Ferrell takes the girl to Warbucks' Park Avenue home. Though Warbucks, who is in love with nothing but money, initially does not want Annie, he becomes taken with her, so much so that he wants to adopt her. But something unfortunate does take place: Miss Hannigan and her crooked brother Frances ""Rooster"" Hannigan pose as Annie's long-lost parents, and thus a complication ensues. In all this, Annie somehow knows that they are not her real parents, and later Warbucks' friend President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the FBI soon learn that it is a true fact. Thus, the Hannigans' scheme fails before the two are arrested, Annie is adopted by ""Daddy"" Warbucks, and Oliver gives Grace Ferrell an engagement ring.
So many elements make it an endearing movie to be seen many times.  The movie and story are both like a sweet dream. The songs continue to run through the mind, such as ""Tomorrow"", ""Maybe"", ""It's as Hard-knock Life"", and ""I Don't Need Anything But You"". The acting is very good: Victor Garber does well in portraying two types of people: a rich money-lover but then a kind, soft-hearted man. Kathy Bates does a good pose as Miss Hannigan, Audra McDonald is wonderful in her role as Grace Ferrell, the lady who is so sweet that she is too good to be true (but also knows how to handle well Oliver Warbucks), and Alicia Morton is very good as the precious-yet-very-brave Annie.

He attempts to adopt the girl, but she has one thing on her mind: to find her real parents. When Warbucks announces that he will pay a lot of money to find Annie's mother and father a torrid scheme to milk money from the millionaire is hatched by the headmistress of the orphanage, played superbly by Kathy Bates.

And who couldn't like the wonderful Kathy Bates!  She did a great job as Miss Hannigan but what ruined it for me as a whole was when she pretends to be Annie's lost mother and she's not disguised well enough and it's obvious it's her instead of the usual Lily character played by the adorable Kristen Chenowith.  Alan Cumming was equally brilliant.  He's an incredibly versatile actor as well and his character of Rooster was absolutely tantalizing.

This one is so much better in every way.  It is almost perfectly done, moves along at the right pace and is really entertaining.  Get the sound track too. The music is wonderful.

The Carol Burnett version is much less PC and not as appropriate for young children.  Carol Burnett is too drunk and mean; the scenes where Annie is in danger are a bit too scary for young kids, and the dancing is of the manic 80's Flash Dance genre - comic today.

The musical is regrettably simplified and shortened for its TV running time, but remains extremely enjoyable and, despite budget and set limitations, far livelier than the overwrought 1982 film.  The songs are beautifully sung, and the production numbers are no less delightful for their simplicity.  I wish that they could have filmed the full musical, as plotted, with exactly this cast; the result would absolutely have been the definitive ""Annie.""

However, there are more songs, so I'm sure some people like that. The downfalls of this movie is mainly the cast. The little girl playing annie is cute, has red hair (but straight!) and can sing but she cannot act well at all. She is quite stiff with her lines and the girl in the old one was much better at conveying emotion. Ms. Hannigan is also less mean and threatning. They tried to sugarcoat her ""cruelty"" to the girls when it wasn't even presented as that bad in the old one, and Carol Bernet was naturally hilarious as she always was in the old version. I also don't like the Mr. Warbucks in this version, because he isn't as distant and cold as the other one is. Annie is supposed to be so sweet she makes the stern, hard, even scrooge-like Mr. Warbucks melt and become a caring father figure. In this version he isn't as serious or rigid as I think he should be. As I said, the music is good, but for a better all around movie, get the first one.",1220659200,,1088,4.065116279069767

However, after the first 15 minutes of this, I couldn't stomach any more. Aileen Quinn's Annie was spunky, spirited, cheeky and appealing; this new Annie is simply cute, sickeningly sweet and has no fire in her whatsoever.

I did feel sorry for Kathy Bates, having to follow the brilliant Carol Burnett in the role of Miss Hannigan; she does a decent job while unfortunately not expressing any of the worn-out contempt and resignation with which Carol managed to imbue her performance. Victor Garber is adequate (I do like him very much as an actor), but also fails to play Daddy Warbucks with the overbearing bluster and paternal warmth of Albert Finney.

Although the older version contains more theatrical elements, such as the unlikely dance numbers etc, the new version has a far more theatrical quality to it overall (by which I mean ""hammy""). Nor does it convey the sense of time and place as well as the older version.

Basically, this was a huge disappointment to me, with none of the warmth, attitude and exuberance of the original. It's typical saccharine Hollywood fare of the kind that makes Brits and Aussies laugh at such syrupy but empty American sentimentality.",1187740800,,1319,4.776315789473684

I really thought it would be too much for her since this version and the broadway production are different (as others have stated).  But she followed along wonderfully singing all the songs she knew.

This is by far her favorite movie and she follows the choreographed routines of the orphan girls and mimics the songs much more than any of the princess movies.  It truly is very well acted and very charming.",1171756800,3,681,4.408
1093273,4,6305870187,"This version of Annie is a great introduction for the younger set and showcases some terrific Broadway talent, but leaves out a lot from the original stage version. As others have mentioned, the politics, romance between Grace and Warbucks, and villianous behavior of Miss Hannigan that were such a winning combo on stage have been toned way down by Disney. Alicia Morton is adorable and has a beautiful voice, but trades in a lot of Annie's signature pluck for sweetness. Some of the song lyrics have been changed, while other songs have been cut completely. The purist might find all of this this detrimental, but my 3 year old does not know the difference and just enjoys the heck out of the story, the singing, and the dancing. And the length of the film is perfect for her attention span. Miss Hannigan appears to have kicked her drinking problem in this version, which robs both the actress and the viewers of some great comedic material, but leaves parents of young children with less explaining to do.

While this version of Annie is a bit of a ""Lite"" approach, it is in my opinion an improvement over the overdone 1992 version. Editing a few things out is to me less of a crime of creative liberty than adding a character (Poonjab) and songs that were not part of the stage version.

So far there is no movie version that is a worthy substitute for seeing Annie live on stage in its entirety, but this movie covers the basic storyline and memorable songs, and is great for young Annie-lovers.",1170460800,4,1501,4.617977528089888

The cast was spectacular. Alicia Morton sang remarkably well, and her face was as sweet as an angel's. Victor Garber disclosed an adorable paternal side whose existence I never even suspected. Kathy Bates was not quite wicked enough as Miss Hannigan, but she did her job. Audra McDonald also did a good job as Grace Farrell. All in all, there is no cast character to complain about.

The movie was short, but it I'd rather it be that way than in the original movie. A condensed version of the best songs is better than a prolonged tale filled with extra fabrications.

1093386,4,6305870187,"As much as I adored the original version of this film with Albert Finney and Aileen Quinn, I am not the type of person who instantly shuns remakes. I love the story of ""Annie"" and was very excited to see a new version when this first came out in 1999.

The 1980's ""Annie"" flick had a specific passion and energy that pretty much cannot be equalled by anything. But this remake has something special going for it, partly because of what many other reviewers here have indicated: it follows the Broadway musical production much more closely than the undoubtedly fabricated fluff from the original. This movie tells the famous story in a lighthearted and simple fashion without going overboard with the music and dance numbers, and that is one important factor that can reel in younger viewers better this time around.

Really, the only thing I didn't particularly love about this film was the acting. Alicia Morton is adorable (you can also catch her all grown up as the middle school ""mean girl"" in the Lifetime movie ""Odd Girl Out""), but she lacks the mental and physical toughness that made Aileen Quinn's performance such a knockout. Morton is too soft-spoken in her role, and she seems to be reciting lines more than she emotes in front of the camera, but for the movie it still works okay. Kathy Bates' performance was arguably one of the biggest mistakes; we all know what kind of character Miss Hannigan is, and Bates portrayed her as a relatively nice woman whose biggest problem with the little orphans seemed to be just getting a little annoyed with them from time to time. Victor Garber is a terrific actor, and I enjoyed him in this movie, but he didn't show Oliver Warbucks' typical transition from gruffness to having his heart melted by little Annie. The woman in the role of Grace Farrell probably did the best job; she was kind, sensitive, and just loved Annie--her performance was right on target.

In this film's defense, maybe their reason for toning down the demeanors of some of these main characters was to keep it a light, easy and enjoyable movie for children. In that sense, I think kids will like it better than the original because it just tells the story from Annie's viewpoint and keeps a youthful, innocent glow to it. So, even if you are very loyal to the original, this is certainly something worth examining with an open mind--if nothing else, you get a sweet, classic story in a fresh new perspective.",1149984000,3,2435,4.697892271662764

And boy do I love it. Newcomer Alicia Morton as Annie is a star in her own right and she is very well supported by her cat.

Daddy Warbucks is an even greater disappointment: weak and mealy. This guy went from nothing to great wealth and power? Hard to believe, seeing this film. I have to agree with the reviewer who complained of the Disney-fication of the film. It's a pity. Oh, kids will love it. But they'll love Barney too if they're given nothing better.

I was so excited when, I heard that Disney planned on re-doing the musical. I looked forward to it and when Annie first aired on ABC my mom let me stay up later than my bedtime to watch it. I had high hopes for the made for T.V musical- hearing that it was going to stick more to the Broadway show than the orignal did. But, it failed it lacked some kind of wonder or spark you would assume to get from it.

Kathy Bates is no doubt an increadible actress but, in Annie I got no sense that she was evil or had it out for the orphan and was highly disappointed in her performance as the evil Ms. Hannigan. The orphans were cute but, lacked the talent, sweetness that you got from the orignal sweeties. Alicia Morton despite the rave reviews she has recieved online failed to impress me as the darling orphan and her voice seemed to lack the part- not to mention the charm you saw in the orginal Annie- Aileen Quinn.

Their were a few good points I didn't know Victor Garber could sing and he had charisma as Oliver Warbucks I found myself wishing he would adopt me. And Audra McDonald who did a fabulous job in the Broadway musical Ragtime does just as good a job in Annie as Grace I found her increadibly charming and sweet. The dog of course is cute and I think was brought from the revival cast of the musical.

But, the story was horribly adapted a mixture of the orignal and the Broadway musical leaving out a ""New Deal For Christmas"" and the F.D.R version of ""Tomorrow"" perhaps to save time but, it was a wrong move.

This movie is bound to keep kiddies occupied for a time but, still dosn't have the charm that the orignal has- the great cast. Now, I do have problems with the orignal Annie- the storyline and such but despite that everytime I see it I feel happy and compared to this version it's the BEST alternative. I suppose why this musical made for television failed was because it was made for television which gave producers, directors, and actors less time to prepare and put the finishing details on it. The casting process too was a bit rigidity and I find myself baffled why they didn't cast kids that had a little bit more Broadway ecxpierience(Alicia Morton is the only one). You feel little to no connection in the cast and most members are decent singers but just lack pizazz!

Judging by some of the reviews some people are bound to like it but, after it finished on television I felt nothing but disappointment and I only wished they had made this into an actual movie instead of T.V. it might have turned out better. Oh well at least we have the orignal and Tomorrow to hold onto!",1113782400,3,2758,4.296153846153846
1093464,2,6305870187,"Having seen the original movie version many times, I had a certain amount of expectations for this new version, especially considering the cast, many of whom I love to watch. Unfortunately, while it's obvious that much thought and effort have gone into sets and staging, the whole thing comes off as too practiced, too pat. Alicia Morton as Annie makes a good effort, but her voice, especially in the big numbers like Tomorrow, sounds way too much like a trained singer and not enough like a little girl expressing a thought. The orphans look like an exercise in diversity rather than a cohesive group.

A good hour of plot dealing with Warbucks's characterization has also disappeared, as have Miss Hannigan's antagonistic tendencies. At first I enjoyed seeing her played a little more humanly, given her reactions in the end sequence of the original, but it seems like *any* hint of her being an evil-stepmother-type has been washed away. As have her drinking habit and risque garb, by the way.

Some liberties are taken with plot points, such as where and how Sandy comes into the picture and what goes on during Annie's night on the town with Warbucks. Not huge things, but if you know the original well, they're hard not to notice. And then there's the ending...but that's a rant all its own.

Alan Cumming was this show's saving grace, in my opinion - one of the few people other than Tim Curry who could pull off the role of Rooster. You can tell he's having a great time in the role, and his movements and delivery are enthusiastic, with just that hint of tongue-in-cheek I personally think the role needs. Kudos also to the ""Anything but You"" number, which was the first time the movie really made me smile.

Audra MacDonald, who plays Grace, seems perfect for the role, but the characterization the writers, costumers, etc have forced her into negates that potential. I mean, somehow I think the concept of a business suit on a woman was not a popular one in the early 30s, and they seem to have missed the memo about her longing for Warbucks. She has the stately, competent bit down to a science, though.

Overall, I'd say if you're a fan of the original, then its not worth the price to buy or even rent this version, since you'll probably end up spending half the time pointing out changes and injustices. If you haven't seen the original, or don't really care, this is at least a mildly entertaining way to spend 90 minutes.",1109980800,11,2438,4.647331786542924

1093584,1,6305870187,"Having seen the 1982 big screen adaptation of Annie, I was somewhat currious to see how Disney would update it for the 1999 version. Boy, were we shortchanged Disney actually went out of their way to mess up this classic because the story is very self-explanatory.

Annie (who is supposed to have curly red hair) is an orphan. Living in the home run by the tyranical Miss Hannigan, she dreams of being reunited with her parents who have left a note to someday return for their little girl. This is a fairly straight forward script, yet somehow Disney went out of their way to bungle it.

Carol Burnett is a hard act to follow, but Kathy Bates (Miss Hannigan) is just way too wimpy and way too sober to be a big screen villan. Instead of being creepy, Bates was just annoying and looked like she also realized that this screenplay could have used better direction. She forgot that viewers are not supposed to like Miss Hannigan and she was supposed to be an evil lush.

Grace Farrell, Oliver Warbucks personal secretary, was cast as an African American in this film. Disney's attempt at multiculturalism forgets that an anti-New Dealer conservative Republican such as Warbucks also would have absorbed the racial stereotypes of his day. Furthermore, that same play/movie character would not have declared his love for a black woman.

One notable highlight is the original 'Annie' (from the 1977 stage production) Andrea McArdle belts out 'NYC'. Unfortunately this impressive vocal command is not enough to save a screen play which is hindered by the repeated confusion of style with substance.",1101427200,11,1592,4.863468634686347
1093585,5,6305870187,"I must say that I really enjoy this version of Annie.  I have always loved and enjoyed the origional movie made in 1982 and it was that which caused Annie to be my first and favorite musical growing up.  The Broadway play that it was based off of however, must recieve its credit.  It is a far more believable story, and the music is truly wonderful.  This remake of the movie was far more true to the origional than the first.  The first was an attempt to please audiences with special effects (somewhat newer at the time) and with the ""all star"" classic actors cast.  This new version, however, was cast almost entirely from stage stars and not movie stars.  It held far more true to the story, and retained much of the cherishable traditions of Annie.  I'm glad certain things were taken out, they were somewhat dated and are better off not in.  Other things I did miss.  All in all, however, I think that this is the best thing I have seen in a long time. The real Annie from the musical was not supposed to have curly red hair for the entire show, only at the point in which the staff was told to ""gussy her up"" for a Christmas celebration/adoption.  Red curly hair was not the fashion at the time and it would be rediculous to think that a young girl from an orphanage would have a hair style out of her time.  And just for the record, for those who don't know it, Punchab was NEVER a character in the origional musical and to fault this movie for excluding his caracter is really silly.",1098921600,5,1493,4.311827956989247
1093586,1,6305870187,"When I watched this when it was a first run tv movie, I remember thinking how pathetic an attempt it really was, and I just could not understand why an effort was made to do this, when the original movie with PERFECT casting still runs on tv and is now available on DVD. What a waste of money spent by the Disney and televison station who ran it. Too bad Disney had to make such a obviously rushed project, with no regard for facts, detail, or making sure the integrity of the story and show is protected. Now, to see they actually felt it was deemed for release on video and DVD. I nearly threw up when I saw it for the first time in the store. It's not like the last time a movie was made about ""Annie"" it was in black and white and it needed updating for the purposes of the red hair and red dress, and to be able to show the mansion, and other beautiful set designs that are shown in the 1981 original staring Aileen Quinn, Carol Burnette, Tim Curry, Burnadette Peters, ALburt Finney, and Ann Reinking.

Kathy Bates can't compete with the perfect portrayal of ""Miss Hannigan"" by Carol Burnette (who combined mean and funny) and Tim Currey as her insane villan of a brother ""rooster"" and his dumbbell and equally insane villan girlfriend played by Burnadette Peters, who would kill Annie to get to the reward money, if they had to.

Who decided to take away the trade mark Annie hair and make her have STRAIGHT BROWN (DIDN'T LOOK RED TO ME) hair! What a dumbbell move! What...could they not find a curly red wig in props or had one made? Don't tell me Disney couldn't afford to make sure that MAJOR detail is pulled off. They show it a little curly on the cover, and maybe it looks slightly that way at the end of teh movie, but ANNIE HAD TIGHT CURLS THE ENTIRE SHOW / MOVIE.  She did not have straight hair that was curled/permed and dyed a REAL RED once taken in by Daddy Warbucks, played WONDERFULLY by ALbert Finney, and his secretary, played by Ann Reinking! What a major detail flaw!  Annie has ALWAYS been a curly redhead, and Aileen Quinn played her perfectly in 1981! And Punjab was perfect! I even loved Sandy in the original!

Kathy Bates may have been scarey in ""Misery"", but she just can't pull off the scarey but histerically funny performance of Carol Burnette, who was made for the role! The orphans were afraid of the mean, drunk Miss Hannigan, and Kathy Bates was so bad at playing ""mean"" that all we could do was cringe at the terrible performance. We just couldn't see why the orphans would have been afraid of her, and that they couldn't escape her! PLEASE! If I were one of the orphans, I would have laughed in her face when she tried to be mean. The kids were tougher than her!

The only thing good about this adaptation (and the only reason it gets a star -- although I feel it deserves a 1/2 star, but that wasn't an option) is the singing and dancing. The rest, is a travesty to the legacy of this wonderful play and (original) movie from 1981.

FORGET THIS VERSION...BUY THE SPECIAL ANNIVERSARY EDITION OF ANNIE (1981) that was released this year...2004! It is worth your money. This ""remake"" is a waste of it! Why would you want a Annie who doesn't even look like ""Annie""?",1098144000,7,3203,4.382154882154882

It's much more faithful to the play than the original movie with Carol Burnette.  The cast, Alicia Morton, Victor Garber,Kathy Bates, Audra McDonald, Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth, were all wonderful and perfect for the roles they played. Andrea McArdle(the original Annie) sparkled in a cameo. Fans of the original play might be disappointed that almost all political references have been eliminated (F.D.R. was basically a cameo role), but it really didn't affect the movie all that much. I'm especially happy that they left the movie set at Christmas time, the original movie for some reason was set in the summer. The fact that it is Christmas adds to the magic of the movie.

1093590,1,6305870187,"The 1982 version of Annie was my favorite movie when I was a kid, so after reading the reviews here I was very optimistic about seeing this Disney version.  It turned out to be a huge disappointment and I really can't understand how it got any good reviews at all.  Sure, the music was nicely recorded and the actress who played Annie was even decent for the role, but the script and other characters demolished any hope of a viable remake.  Though many talented actors were present, they were casted terribly.  Kathy Bates was nowhere near as good as Carol Burnette in the role of Miss Hannigan.  Could she be less scary?  The orphans seemed like such brats it made her seem more like the victim rather than the other way around!  Also Victor Garber was incredibly unconvincing in the role of the cold hearted, money loving Warbucks.  It didn't seem like he was even expected to try.  They showed absolutely no development in the relationship between him and Annie so his immediate attachment to her came off as creepy.  It practically appeared as if he was going to propose marriage, not ask to adopt her.  This was a big mistake because one of the best parts of this story is how Daddy Warbucks starts out as a man so consumed with power and money but slowly realizes that there is more to life through the charm of a dirty little, somewhat homely orphan who would be the least likely person to affect someone of his caliber.  None of the villains were even slightly threatening either which gave no victory to the plot in any of the conflict either.  Because these elements were completely missing there was no point to the story.  Let's not even talk about how ridiculously fast they wrapped up the ending.  The historically inaccurate, P.C. portrayal of the 30's was also laughable.  It's basically a complete waste of everyone's time so spare yourself the grief.",1086566400,11,1869,4.635258358662614

The only reason I was curious to see the film was because ""Chicago"" became my favorite film of 2002 and I was eager to see Rob Mashall's film directing debut. (Many people consider Chicago his debut, but this is it, although being made-for-TV). The cast is magnificant--Tony winners Audra McDonald (Grace), Alan Cumming (Rooster), and Kristin Chenoweth (Lily), plus four-time nominee Victor Garber (who makes a terrific Daddy Warbucks) and Les Misrables veteran Alicia Morton, who is absolutely mesmerizing in her portrayal of Annie. Oscar-winner and always terrific Kathy Bates is superb as the villainous Miss Hannigan, and surprisingly, she can SING!!! And although I haven't seen the stage version (as mentioned), Andrea McArdle's (the original Annie) cameo was very clever. Mention must also be made to the orphans, whose renditions of ""Hard Knock Life"" and ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" were absolutely sensational. That said, ALL the numbers are show-stoppers and very catchy, and the story is truly heartfelt. At 90 minutes, it is a perfect running length, as opposed to the 130 minute original (if I get fussy after two hours, I can't imagine how a child will feel). Adults and children alike are bound to enjoy this version, which many consider superior to the original. I believe Rob Marshall's brilliant directing and genius choreograhy are to thank. He definitely matured in ""Chicago"", but this is a fantastic debut, and it is easy to see its influence in ""Chicago"" iself. I am not a huge fan of remakes, thinking them pointless, but this is one remake I am thankful for. Now, if only a special edition DVD with Commentary and Behind-the-Scenes is released.

1093694,5,6305870187,"This version was originally produced for television by the Walt Disney Studios and knocks the socks off of the 1982 Aileen Quinn/Albert Finney/Carol Burnett version.  Newcomer Alicia Morton (who played Cosette on Broadway) joins Broadway veteran Victor Garber and the phenomenal Kathy Bates to take a fresh look at a classic.
The main differences in this version are that it was staged more as a play - keeping true to its writing.  Also, the producers were smart enough to get a cast that can actually sing!  Morton's voice is beautiful and much stronger than fans are used to, but she does the songs justice.  The sets and choreography are also worth an extra long look.
There are some differences, some songs have been cut (though NYC makes its appearance once again in a wonderful rendition by Garber).  A few minor plot changes, line changes, and order of scenes make this version unique, but not necessarily better nor worse than any other.
Why 5 stars?:
This DVD offers a fresh look at a classic and has an excellent cast that can act and sing!  They do what the 1982 version just couldn't - and do it well!  This should be a part of every family's DVD library.",1040860800,5,1168,4.640776699029126

The staging and choreography are dull and uninspired.  The worst offender is ""hard-knock life"".  The kids just seem to twirl sheets and towels through half the song.  That's choreography???  It looks like a bad camp show.
The casting is not bad.  But, the characters were not allowed to develop.  Mr. Warbucks is soft and fuzzy from the beginning.  Miss Hannigan is miscast with Kathy Bates.  She's way too politically correct (she seems to care about the kids from the beginning).  Kudos to Alan Cumming for his portrayal as Rooster.  Alicia Morton is weak as Annie, she has so little spunk.
I do hope that Disney continues to produce musicals for the screen, at whatever budget.  However, I hope they remember that not everything has to be touchy-feely and politically correct ""after-school special"", as this one seems.

Although I like this version very much, I would have to say that the older version had a little more charm and realism linked to it. But, as far as value goes, this version does a good job of introducing the story to the young ones of this generation and giving them a film filled with wonderfully-sung songs that they can all enjoy. Alicia Morton is a very good Annie--sweet, cute, optimistic, and altogether unforgettable. I liked the softness that Victor Garber brought to the character of Daddy Warbucks. Audra McArdle is also great, with a beautiful singing voice and a wonderful motherly love for Annie. Actually, the only thing I didn't really like about this movie was Kathy Bates' portrayal of Miss Hannigan. I loved her as the wealthy Molly Brown in ""Titanic,"" but to me, she doesn't quite cut it as Miss Hannigan. She didn't seem mean enough. Anyone who has seen 1982's version knows that Carol Burnett played the character to the point where nobody could possibly compare. In this 1999 version, Miss Hannigan seems nicer; she still treats those orphans cruelly, but something about her gives you that impression that she's trying to hide the fact that she actually likes them a little bit. That's not how I see Miss Hannigan. But, other than this, the movie is great. It's not quite as good as the 1982 version that I grew up with and came to love so much, but it's still very very good.

1093813,3,6305870187,"Its been over a decade since I last watched the original movie version of Annie.  I have never been that impressed with it, preferring the 1999 TV remake since it sticks closer to the play.  However, I recently sat down and watched it again.  Its still not great, but its not horrible.

The plot follows the familiar story of Annie (Aileen Quinn), an orphan in 1930s New York.  Certain her parents are out there, she has a habit of breaking out of the orphanage and running away from Miss Hannigan (Carol Burnett), the woman who is supposed to be watching her and the other orphans.

Annies world turns around when she is invited to spend a week with Oliver Warbucks, the billionaire (Albert Finney).  Soon, Warbucks wants to adopt Annie.  But are her parents still out there somewhere?

One problem Ive always had with the play and the remake, as much as I love them both, is the idea that the orphanage is so small.  Oh, I get cast constraints and what not.  Here, there are plenty more orphans, which make the time spent there seem more real.  And it also means that Its a Hard-Knock Life gets a better dance sequence.  I like it.

I also like the song and dance number We Got Annie that the staff sings when they learn Warbucks intends to adopt Annie.  (In an interesting bit of trivia, this is a re-working of a song originally intended for an early version of the play.)

The Asp and Punjab both make appearances.  As a fan of the comic strip in my childhood days, I enjoyed seeing them.

One of my favorite scenes from the play has always been the scene with Annie and Warbucks at the radio station during Youre Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile.  I loved getting to see it here.

And for the most part the movie is fun.  But when it goes wrong, does it ever go wrong.

First of all, theres Carol Burnetts Miss Hannigan.  Here, shes a drunk and a mean one.  Not only do I not find her funny (which Im sure was part of the goal), I just find her cringe worthy.  What a waste of talent.  And don't get me started on the song she sings with Warbucks when Warbucks arrives to get the adoption papers signed.

Then theres the song Lets Go to the Movies.  It replaces NYC from the play, and I find the original a better song story wise.  Then theres the part where they show up clips of the movie.  Sorry, but that does nothing but slow down the story.  Just move on already.

Annies dog Sandy gets a larger part in the movie, something I love since again its a nod to the comic strip.  However, there are two songs sung about him, and I don't particularly like either of them.

Then theres the climax.  Its so over the top its stupid.  I know it was designed to build suspense, but the climax of the play where the villains are out smarted is so much better.

Plus theres the way they treat the shows signature song.  We get Annie singing Tomorrow during the opening credits.  Then she leads the reprise in the second act.  Um, hello.  Theres a reason that song is so well known.  It is the heart and soul of the character at the beginning, and the movie really does lose something for leaving it out.  And when it shows up later, it doesnt have the same amount of fun.

The acting is fine.  Rounding out the cast are the likes of Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters as Rooster Hannigan and Lily St. Regis.  They are a blast.  Many of the adults are slightly broad in their performances, but its not so over the top as to be annoying and it actually does work.

But really, the flaws will always keep this movie from being a favorite.  If this is the only version of Annie youve seen, youll probably enjoy it.  But those who love the play will be disappointed with the changes made.",1016064000,10,3682,4.303649635036496

I didn't really have a problem with the cast. However, Victor Garber just doesn't cut it as Daddy Warbucks. He is supposed to be a grouchy, angry person, but Victor Garber is just too soft. Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth were amazing as the villains. i have to admit that i liked them better than Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters in the '82 version. The voice that Kristin did sounds so funny! Alicia Morton was all right in her role as Annie, with a beautiful singing voice and Audra McDonald as Grace Farrell was good, too.

1094103,4,6305870187,"So, has Kathy Bates EVER been in a film where she didn't do just an outstanding job? As the dasterdly Miss Hannigan, she teams again with Titanic co-star Victor Garber (Daddy Warbucks)to lift a familiar script to new heights! Her closing ""Little Girls"" borders on temporary insanity--a fitting tribute to Mrs. Hannigan's preparation for '...the nut house'!
As with most remakes, you'll either love this one or think it pales in comparison to the Carol Burnett version. This one is better. Audra McDonald (Grace) is perhaps the most pleasant surprise with her wonderfully melodious voice and an ultimate class that supercedes even Warbucks himself!
Alicia Morton (Annie) does a fine job considering the talent and experience of the actors that surround her. The precocious 'brat' never seems intimidated, and in no way disappoints Annie die-hards. Neither do the orphans.
The high point in the film is the poignant Warbucks-Annie ""Something Was Missing"" scene where the world's richest man pours out his heart in song to the child orphan who has stolen his heart. The subsequent dance sequence to the accompaniment of this beautiful musical score is memorable. Garber never loses sight of the tenderness that Oliver Warbucks surely would've possessed.
All in all, a strong cast of Tony-winning performers at every turn delivers the goods in this Disney version of Annie. It takes an award-winning cast of this magnitude to make a story this familiar work again.

1094104,2,6305870187,"This production of Annie is, as others have stated, more faithful to the orignal broadway musical as a whole. The songs are better- and the characters have better singing voices then the previous cast. As a musical, and as a play, it IS a success. But compared to the 1982 version, which I do admit leaves out many songs and well-danced numbers, is on the whole much better acted than this version. The characters in the 1982 version are portrayed with such spunk, such energy and spirit, that, although their voices are lacking in certain places, their personalities come through with full force. Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, Molly, Grace Ferrell, Rooster, Lily, and especially Annie are given strong portrayls which are both provocative and heart-rending. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that although some of the best musical numbers are sung in this version (''NYC'', ''Something was missing'', a better version of '' Easy Street''), and although the setting of New York, and the Depression are protrayed better- everything American, everything which makes the story so much than that of one lonely orphan, is removed. The characters are played as they would be on stage - as well-sung, but lacking as people. Annie, here portrayed by Alicia Morton, has a lovely voice, and a nice smile, but as a character, and a symbol of hope, honesty, and courage, she is severly lacking. She seems too perpetually ordinary- too sad. She may have more ''street-smart'' to her than Aileen Quinn's Annie did, but she lacks the very spunk, energy, and fire which makes Annie rise above the poverty of the depression. Instead Annie is given an entertaining, but ordinary protrayl- not that there is anything wrong with protraying a character as normal and down-to-earth, but Annie is supposed to be anything but ordinary. Aileen Quinn's Annie had spunk and spirit, and I can see her leading and standing for her country in such depressing times. Alicia Morton just doesn't fit that description. Grace Ferrell, while played by a woman with a wonderful voice, does not the motherly love towards Annie that Ann Reiking's Grace did. The relationship of love and tenderness, or Daddy Warbucks telling Annie she was ''special'', and showing her such, is not portrayed to any great extent in this film- Andrew Garber, while having a gifted singing talent, doesn't have either the stone-meaness, or the soft tenderness that Albert Finney did. As for Miss Hannigan- I have to say that almost no one can compete with the entertaining, deliciously evil Carol Burnett , and Kathy Bates, while definately talented in other roles (see her in ''Titanic''), cannot protray either the meanness, insecurity, or power that Miss Hannigan had to hold over the orphans, in order to make herself feel human. Instead she is, like Alicia Morton, a perpetually ordinary woman. But as I have said in the beginning, the film has wonderful singing talent, and wonderful dancing numbers, and that alone makes it worth seeing. But it is a two-dimensional showing of the characters which were intended to be so much more than just common people. ( The possible exception to all of the above is Alan Cumming, who, as Rooster, while not as necessarily evil as Tim Curry, nicely protrays a schemeing con-artist, and amoral convict.) I wish the director, and producers of this movie has combined with the cast of the old movie. In short, I would recommend this movie to all who like broadway musicals, but it seems much more like a fraction of the story that Harold Ikes wanted told than a complete three-dimensional retelling of a story of an optomisitc young girl.",974419200,13,3631,4.944353518821604

This new Disney version stays faithful to the stage score and script, not like John Huston's rambling version back in 1981 (refer to my review for this), and it is a delight to watch.  It has that 'theatrical-style' feel to it.
The esteemed cast, the bulk of which are seasoned Broadway performers, include Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan, Alan Cumming as Rooster, Audra McDonald as Grace Farrell, Kristin Chenoweth as Lily St Regis, Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks and the lovely Alicia Morton as Annie.  Making a cameo in the 'NYC' number as ''Star To Be'' is (oh happy day) the original Broadway Annie - Andrea McArdle.
The cast is sensational, and while I will not bring down the 1981 performers of Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters and Ann Reinking, they are far more believable in their interpretations.

1094107,4,6305870187,"When I found out that they would remake Annie, I was very glad because the Carol Burnett version was horrible. I agree with the reviewer who said that the people that compared it to old movie version were lost. This version is based on the play which is a lot better than John Huston's(Carol, Bernadette) mess. This was done right with some of the songs that were left out of John Huston's version put back in. In his version Tomorrow was thrown away. In this version the song is done full speed ahead. Reportedly John Huston didn't like the song Tomorrow and that has to be the biggest number and it is in this version. People who want action should keep their Carol Burnett version, but people who like music and cultured Broadway entertainment should get this one. I will admit that Kathy Bates is a little too nice and I would have liked it if the movie were longer and they had kept the Depression story line in. Annie does have red hair in this but don't know if they styled it right in this. I was in a stage version of the Broadway play and realized then how much better the play is than John Huston's movie. The writers of that movie are the ones who tampered with the plot of the Broadway show and not the other way round. It made me mad to read some of the bad reviews that were given by some of the people on Amazon. They don't have any idea what they are talking about because they must have never heard the Broadway recording with Andrea McArdle. Andrea makes a cameo on NYC in this version and sings wonderfully well. She is the original Annie and the best of all of the versions, but the Annie in this one can sing well and they don't have that dumb song from the other movie version  -Dumb Dog. So if you like good music well done, buy this one. If you want action, buy that awful movie version that wasted the talents of Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry with its claustraphobic set and action paced plot that was nothing like the musical which took place at Christmas and not Fourth of July. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it wasn't long enough and they left out We'd Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover and the whole Depresssion which was crucial to the plot.",969667200,14,2213,4.306954436450839

1094214,4,6305870187,"This has been one of my favorite musicals ever since I saw the original Broadway show back in 1978. The Disney version of this classic show is much, much better than the overblown, overdone 1982 film because it is much  more faithful to the stage production, even though there are a few minor  plot changes.
  I felt that the singing and acting was quite good.  Alicia Morton was a great Annie, and Audra MacDonald played Grace Farrel,  Oliver Warbucks secretary to a tee. Kathy Bates was as good of a Miss  Hannigan as Carol Burnette was in the 1982 version of the film. The only  person that I thought was miscast was Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks. In  all honesty, Albert Finney played the role so much better, and with more  warmth and compassion than Garber. One of the big highlights in the film  (for me, anyway) is Andrea McArdle's (the orignal Annie) cameo in the  ""N.Y.C."" number.  Most of the key songs from the stage  show are there. However, ""We'd like to thank you Herbert Hoover"",  ""Annie"", and "" A New Deal for Christmas"" are missing.  And I admit, that I missed them in this production.

1094215,2,6305870187,"This review will not win me ""positive"" votes, but I must speak my mind.
This current trend of filming musicals for television is wonderful for the genre.  My complaint, seen here in ANNIE, is the  ""Readers Digest"" versions they're tending to churn out.
I was  very excited to see this new version of ANNIE (the John Huston film from  the 80's was unmemorable and hilariously sent-up in John Waters' film  SERIAL MOM).  After viewing it, I realized the producers and director made  several mistakes.
First, Mrs. Hannigan is the VILLAIN.  In order for any  basic story to work, there is a good guy and a villain.  Annie is the good  guy, Mrs. Hannigan is the villain.  Kathy Bates plays her as a sympathetic  lady just trying to run an orphanage!  At least Carol Burnett mined some of  that evilness in the Huston film.  In this version, any badness has been  ""Disney-fied"" out of the character.
Also, Daddy Warbucks is too  nice.  Why do we even care if Annie ends up with him?  His character  doesn't seem to need changing at all.  His secretary seems to think he  works a tad too much, but otherwise he's been ""Disney-fied"" as  well.
And dare I suggest that the romance between Warbucks and the  secretary (played by the incredible Audra McDonald) has been toned down  because of race issues? Or would a romance have been too much of a  character change for the screenwriter as well?
I'm just so disappointed  with this production.  A highlight is the NYC production number.  Andrea  McArdle shines in her cameo (""Just got here this morning..."")  It's a fine, workman production.  But somehow, the heart seems to be gone.  Does anyone really understand the significance of the song  ""Tomorrow""?  It seems like it's just cued up like the  show-stopper we all know it to be.  They film it with a big sweeping camera  move and end it on a special effects shot of New York city.  So what, I  say!  Keep a close up on the little girl playing Annie and let us see what  the song means to the character.
I hope I don't sound too severe, but I  think they really did this show wrong.  I don't believe the reviews that  say ANNIE is a good production.  I think it's mediocre at best -- it could  have been so much better.",961372800,75,2213,4.49746192893401

I was a bit dissappointed by Kathy Bates and Victor Garber. They  weren't aweful, but I know they could have done better. Miss Hannigan  really is an alcoholic and that really didn't come through. The love  between Annie and Daddy Warbucks was lacking on Garber's part. I really  think everyone would have to have seen ANNIE: The Original Musical  production performed to be able to decifer between good and bad movies.

Till then, this one will have to do.",946339200,,859,4.923076923076923
1094309,5,6305870187,"I saw ""Disney's"" Annie on televion and on the new video release.  Those folks who compared the 1999 to 1982 version, and think the 1982 was better, are quite lost.  Annie 1999 was fresh, funny, and adorable.  With  the exception of that beautiful newcomer playing Annie, Disney used some of  the greatest ""Broadway"" and ""Movie Screen"" talents out  there today.  Look at their credentials, there are Academy and Tony awards  all over place. Everything was updated and fresh--it was like (finally)  seeing this overworked musical the way it was intended to be seen.  Congratulations, Disney, on a terrifically made film, our family loved it!",945993600,2,639,5.0576923076923075

7897908,5,6305870187,"If youve come this far then its assumed that you are interested in musicals, you're aware of the show and you are at least familiar with Tomorrow.

The reason that this version deserves your attention is that it follows the original script and score exactly as Thomas Meehan, Charles  Strouse and Martin Charnin wrote it for theatre in the mid 1970s. The previous film includes changes to both the script and score. Most of those changes are a disappointment to those who are hoping for an actual representation of the musical. Every song, line, and character is here just as in the original production.

So if you're looking for the film to prepare for a production of Annie or your daughter is interested in auditioning for a local production then this is the one for you.

The actors here all have a strong theatre background. Victor Garbers work on the Broadway stage is paramount. He created the role of Anthony Hope in the original Sweeney Todd. Kathy Bates created the roll of Jessie in the first production of  night, mother at ART in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Both of those shows are classics and both paved the way for highly impressive careers for these actors.

Disney filmed a number of classic musicals, honoring the material in each one. This is no exception.",1518825600,,1274,4.7681818181818185
7897909,5,6305870187,"I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that Disney makes the classic musical more magical than ever! The music. The memories. The magic. Disney makes this beloved musical more magical than ever with an all-new, feature-length production! Featuring an all-star cast and new choreography, this charming tale of an adorable orphan named Annie captures all the fun of the original but adds an unmistakable Disney touch! For a young girl living a hard-knock life in a children's orphanage, things may seem pretty bad especially at Christmas. But feisty Annie carries a song in her heart and hope in her locket the only thing she has from her parents. One day, fed up with the dastardly Miss Hannigan (Academy Award winner Kathy Bates, Annie escapes the run-down orphanage determined to find her mom and dad. Her adventure takes her from the cold, mean streets of New York to the warm, comforting arms of bighearted billionaire Oliver Warbucks with plenty of mischief and music in between! Filled with memorable songs and magical moments, Disney's Annie brings this heartwarming story to a whole new generation. And now you can relive the magic over and over again! What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.",1518480000,,1312,4.835555555555556
