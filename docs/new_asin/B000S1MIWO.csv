8203877,5,B000S1MIWO,"If you're interested in visiting and fishing in this area, this is what you want.  Mike Lawson is a true cowboy-gentleman, and his under-under stated sense of humor had me in stitches (especially when you see the interaction between him and his son.)  He takes you through the entire length of the Henry's Fork, explaining the entire stretch:  how to fish it, the various access points, some history behind it, etc.  It will leave you in good shape to decide how to visit, and how to fish it yourself.",1401062400,,501,4.595505617977528
8203878,5,B000S1MIWO,"Mr. Lawson is already so well respected - this DVD takes you on a pleasant and beautiful journey through the waters of Henry's Fork. You feel like you're sharing a few days on this river - great scenery and great conversation and fine fishing techniques. Most of all, you get to visit a beautiful watershed with an expert who truly appreciates and has lived the background and quality of the Henry's Fork. Sit back and enjoy the ride - a lovely one... This author, fisher, and expert is for real, and avoids self-promotion and the ""see how big this one is"" that often, in this viewer's mind, detracts from many other video productions. Enjoy the scenery and appreciate someone who loves these waters. If you can, fish and admire the Fork. If you cannot, try a few days with Mr. Lawson...",1302566400,,787,4.588652482269503
