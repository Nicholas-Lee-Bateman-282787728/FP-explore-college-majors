1105808,5,6305859620,"I enjoy this DVD. I have an old walking exercise VHS by Leslie Sansone that I really liked. This DVD is updated and is one on one, which is easy to follow. I love that it uses weights, which is great for strength training. The areobic walking is easy on the knees. I think Leslie is funny and the 30 minutes of exercise goes by quickly.",1168819200,66,336,4.106060606060606
1105809,5,6305859620,"My mother-in-law has been using this video for about a month now. The first two weeks she was able to lose 7 pounds by exercising every morning and making sure she didn't eat after seven. She belongs to a senior citizen center and raves about this video to everyone she sees--whom she hasn't already told about it.

Update: My MIL is still using this DVD, and has lost seven pounds. She recently had knee surgery and had to stop for about 2 weeks; she was eager to get back to using it as she said she feels a difference in her days and her sleep when she does the exercises in the video on a daily basis.",1157587200,118,605,4.170940170940171
1105810,5,6305859620,"I like this tape. I have end stage hip arthritis (need a hip replacement), & have degenerative disk disease in my back from yrs of doing extreme sports. I am now also 50# overwgt - gained it over the last few yrs because of the arthritis.

I was afraid to even start exercising, & afraid of a tape that was too fast & I'd hurt myself (like the TV show workouts I've seen)...

But I was able to get started with this, & felt invigorated after doing it, not worn out or in pain.

Leslie is kind, understanding & encouraging on the tape, this is what I needed. So to me, watching the same tape over & over, & hearing the encouragement, is good, not repetitious.

She also continually reminds & shows you how to do the exercises properly so you don't hurt yourself.

The 30 minute workout is walking, marching, some sidesteps, easy lunges (you can make them as hard as you want tho), & stretching.

This is my first exercise tape.

Good luck to you all!",1117411200,175,949,4.297752808988764
1105811,5,6305859620,"My mother has used this workout regularly for the past 5-6 years (she's now 78 years old). She likes it because it gives her an overall good workout without discouraging her by being overly strenuous. I often listen from the next room while I'm working, so I can say (and she heartily agrees) that Leslie's words are encouraging, not annoying to hear with repeated use of the workout, as is the background music. I even know an 82-year-old neighbor who'd stopped going to a class for seniors and now works with Leslie.",1116979200,270,518,4.641304347826087

I FIND HER MOST BENEFICIAL AND HELPFUL. I HAVE BOUGHT OTHER TAPES OF HERS INCLUDING WALK THE WALK WITH THE CHRISTIAN MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.

1106459,5,6305859620,"I consider myself in fairly good shape but I still found myself sweating and working more than I expected with this video.  Since she also uses weights for much of it, I alternate each day with another of Leslie's walking videos for the two mile walk.

It is in slower movements that you really work your muscles. I did notice a couple of timing errors on Leslie's part but nothing critical that I could not overcome. The last segment of stretching was excellent even though Leslie kept me ""hanging"" while she was explaining something that should have been explained at the conclusion of, not during, the stretching.
Once I got used to the slow jazz music in the background, I started to look forward to this DVD. Leslie's other DVDs which I've ordered over the years have become much too fast paced for me (turning 70).",1414972800,3,686,4.585365853658536

So I decided to try this workout which is geared towards seniors. I'm 47 and have done other Leslie Sansone walking DVDs and can I say this is one of her best workouts. I used three pound weights but she says not to use more than two pounds. I didn't have less weight so just went with what I have. All the typical Leslie moves are here so it will be familiar to most people who have done her workouts. I felt that I got a better workout from this DVD than from her five mile workouts.

Due to the heart attack, it took me about 2 months to get all the way through this one.  Don't be fooled by the title.  As Leslie says, ""there is nothing sissy about this.""  I took it in increments, slowly building up my stamina.  It's a 30 minute, mile and a half that is doable for people with heart or joint issues.  You will need one pound weights and 30 minutes of your time.  And you will feel much better in just a couple of months.  I do this at least 5 times a week (usually 6 and sometimes 7).

1106894,4,6305859620,"Sensible, easy to follow  Great for older folks.  One small issue:  I had to modify some of the moves a bit, because of bad knees.  Leslie says nothing about accommodations for knee issues.  Or balance issues.  Other workout videos do mention how to adapt.
Otherwise, it's a good workout and very doable.  You'll need small hand weights.",1406764800,,337,4.807017543859649

1106896,4,6305859620,The only thing I don't really like about this is the fact that Leslie stops to use weights right in the middle of the fast walk so it kind of throws off the rhythm.

1106944,1,6305859620,"First, Leslie chatters non-stop, which eventually grates on your nerves. Second, she speaks in a condescending, patronizing manner as though she is talking to little children. I don't see that in her other videos, so I guess she is just a typical younger adult who thinks older adults are ""cute"" and need to be talked down to. Third, she tells you that if you don't have energy you're not attractive. What a cruel thing to say to older adults, who are obviously seeing their energy decline as they age. You can slow it but you can't stop it. It is a normal part of aging.

I recommend Jane Fonda's recent videos. I especially like Walk Out, which has a beginner level and a faster level. Jane is actually an older adult (in her 70's now, I believe). She is encouraging, not condescending. She shares how she has adjusted her routine now that she has had joint replacements and how she moves more slowly and carefully in stretching now to avoid injury. And yet, she is calmly upbeat and optimistic. I feel like, ""We're in this together and she understands,"" when I do her videos.",1399334400,19,1078,4.556701030927835

I have many health issues now that I have reached My Golden Years:  bad back & shoulders injured.  Most exercise programs require moving the arms.  Can't do that.  I can walk -- slowly.  I love this program!  I can walk in place or around the room.  I can stand, holding onto my cane or a chair and still keep the legs moving.  I can walk for 5 minutes or 20 minutes.  Whatever will work for the time I have.  I can stop the DVD & start it up again, picking up where I left off.  Some days, this back will not allow me to do very much.  Other days, I can do more.  And do it at my own pace.  I pick out the sections which I can do and then just walk in place for those that I cannot do yet.  Very nicely done video. If all that you are able to do is walk, then give this program a try.  If you can do more, then this video is probably not for you.",1363651200,4,1043,4.521505376344086

She said Leslie Sansone's voice drives her crazy and now she turns the volume down.  I laughed at this and listened to it myself.  I can definitely see her point.  Monotone and nasally.  That aside, my mom has benefited tremendously from using this video to keep her active.  She has an LVEF of 15%, has a bi-v defibrillator, and has COPD on top of this.

1107248,4,6305859620,"I plan to buy this dvd after having borrowed it from the public library.

Even though I'm a couple months out from major surgery and followup treatment lasting nearly six months, I'm still not up to Leslie's regular 1-mile walk yet. This walk is perfect for getting me back in shape more slowly and less strenuously. I really feel the workout when finished but am not as worn out as I was from attempting Leslie's 1-mile walk without weights or arm movements either one. As a result, I'll stick with this workout and do it consistently, I can tell.

I think this workout might be a good choice for others recovering from surgery or a major illness as I am.

For those unfamiliar with Leslie's walking workouts, she really does demonstrate clearly and ease you gradually into the steps and other movements you'll do. Also, she's careful to include thorough warmups, cooldowns and concluding stretches. What I really appreciate about her walking programs is that she emphasizes that you should do what you can. If you don't feel you can do any of the moves, just walk in place during those until you become stronger and more fit. I love that permission and lack of pressure to do more than I really feel up to doing.

I do agree that she's excessively chatty on this dvd, but I think that might be encouraging to someone feeling hesitant about completing the workout.

1107251,5,6305859620,"If you're out of shape or older, or both, this is a great one to start with. It's the first exercise DVD of any kind that I've been able to do all the way through, but I was sweating and huffing and puffing after the 35-40 minutes that it takes. That's the point, though, so that's good. It includes light aerobics, strength training and stretching, and it works all major muscle groups, so it's quite well-rounded. You'll need 1- or 2-lb dumbbells or another kind of hand weights (you can use soup cans at first, but the weights cost less than $10 at discount stores).

Thankfully, it's only Leslie, not a bunch of other people to distract you and make it too ""busy."" Yes, she talks too much, but it would be strange for her to not to talk, too. Just turn the sound down or off after you've been through it a couple of times and know what to expect. The music isn't awful, but like all of these things, isn't good either, and you won't really need it to cue the tempo (I did appreciate the jazz toward the end, though).

It's not perfect, but it's the best place to start for some of us. Netflix has it, so you can rent it to find out for yourself before you buy it. It's discontinued, but I wish she'd reissue it without such a completely off-putting cover (that woman in red doesn't appear in the video, thankfully, nor does Leslie ever act so gung-ho).",1286236800,3,1356,4.313725490196078

1107298,5,6305859620,"""Older Adults Walk and Firm"" is a combination of walking and exercising with weights. The walking comes first and has the usual Leslie Sansone walking moves - walking in place, side steps, knee lifts, and kicks. The video is approximately 30 minutes long, has about 8 minutes of warm-ups, 15 minutes of exercising with the weights and about 7 minutes of cool down. All of this is nice and gentle and nothing is too hard to do.

I really enjoy exercising to ""Older Adults Walk and Firm"". The video is just Leslie, no one else walking and exercising with her. It is a bit slower paced than some of Leslie's other exercise videos, but that's fine because it works perfectly for older adults especially those that have never exercised before. Leslie talks you through the exercises and anything new - like squats and lunges - she introduces slowly. The warm-ups are just the right length. The weight section is very nicely paced. It combines the usual walking exercises (walking in place, walking up and down, side steps, knee lifts and kicks) with exercises such as squats, bicep curls, lifting the weights over your head, and lunges. Leslie guides you through all these exercises and they are done nice and slowly but are still effective. While none of the exercises felt too strenuous while I was doing them, at the end I felt like I got a good workout.

A word of warning - make sure you watch the introduction before you start exercising. In the introduction, Leslie explains how the program works and what kind of weights to use - gloved weights or dumbbells weighing up to two pounds. Also, I love Leslie's exercise programs, but she has a tendency to talk too much and sometimes interrupts the flow of exercising while talking and she gestures a lot which can be confusing.

All in all, I really enjoy ""Older Adults Walk and Firm"".",1199577600,142,1835,4.674922600619195
