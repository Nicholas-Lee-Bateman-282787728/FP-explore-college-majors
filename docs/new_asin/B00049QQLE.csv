2156058,5,B00049QQLE,"Sara Ivanhoe's routines are a pure joy to follow and this one is perfect in combination with the 20-minute weight loss routine. The first routine warms you up and this one pushes you just that little bit further so you get the best workout possible. She teaches everyone from Hollywood stars to normal people like me who don't want to go to the gym and prefer working out at home.

This creative routine will sculpt buns and thighs and also cleanse your soul. By focusing on breathing, you nurture every cell in your body. If you have been working out for quite a few years, some of the exercises in this routine can help you figure out if you are intermediate or advanced.

While beginners will still enjoy most of the exercises, intermediate students will enjoy knowing if they can do a back bend (you are kneeling and you lean backwards) and touch their ankles or if they are still working on flexibility. I can tell you that for the last few years I've been trying to touch my ankles and tonight I actually did. It is definitely worth working towards and boosts your self-esteem substantially. There was just this sense of joy when I could finally touch both ankles. All those hundreds of hours of practice suddenly seem worth the effort!

Mountain, Chair and Triangle pose are included as is a Temple Pose with three lovely variations. There are also some excellent outer hip stretches in this 20-minute routine.

What I love most about this DVD is the aesthetically pleasing environment and the highly creative exercises. The mood of Sara's workouts encourages my full participation and I find them especially enjoyable. Do two of her workouts and then go take a long bath with sea salts and essential oils. Life becomes art...

2156059,5,B00049QQLE,"I am so excited about Sara's 20 Min. Yoga Makeovers! I own all 5 and use them everyday! I feel that I get a super workout and really enjoy her enthusiasm. She does an excellent job explaining poses and reminds you of your breathing! Because it is such a well-rounded, quick program, I know I can get through it even before I start. This is what keeps me popping in the dvd each morning and evening. The yoga poses are manageable for even the very beginner! I only wish I lived in Santa Monica where she teaches classes...good thing I have the tapes! :-)",1127779200,3,553,4.326923076923077
2156060,5,B00049QQLE,"This nice lower body practice does a good job of thoroughly stretching the legs and opening the hips. Instructor Sara Ivanhoe begins the practice in a standing position with several variations of chair pose; each variation is held for a few breaths. She then moves on to a triangle-warrior series for strengthening the leg muscles followed by a temple pose (a plie squat)-fan pose (wide-legged standing forward bend) combo which really stretches the legs, especially the hamstrings. The practice then moves on to the floor for camel pose, first performed with one hand only on each side then both hands. Finally, there is a lunge-lunge twist-pigeon-cobbler series that is perfect for opening the hips, and Sara finishes the practice with a simple seated yoga mudra (hand placement with breath).

I enjoyed this practice a lot, as I'm always looking to open up my legs and hips. This would be an excellent yoga practice for runners or other sports participants whose lower body has become tight. However, because Sara does not provide detailed instruction, I would not recommend this practice for those with no prior experience to yoga. Finally, I think this routine is too short to provide much ""sculpting,"" but it is an excellent practice for stretching the lower body.",1114560000,3,1270,5.0476190476190474
2156061,2,B00049QQLE,"Add me to the list of mildly dissatisfied customers for this product.  I was shopping for a video to use to tone my thighs and, since I regularly practice yoga and am fond of yoga in general, I thought I would see what Sara Ivanhoe had to say.  I thought she might have some suggestions for exercises or positions I don't usually do in my regular yoga practice.  She didn't.  If only these moves were necessary to create ""sculpted buns and thighs,"" my buns and thighs would *already* be sculpted because I've been doing warrior poses and whatnot for years.  At the same time that I got this video, I also got ""Look Great Naked: Thighs,"" and so far I am far happier with that product than with Ivanhoe's video.",1109808000,10,709,4.423076923076923
2156062,3,B00049QQLE,"I liked this short workout, but I would agree with the others it's more of a stretching practice than anything else.

I was disappointed in spending $14 and only getting a single 20-minute workout. I would rather spend a bit more and get several 20-minute workouts. This would be better priced around $9.

Please check my other reviews on Amazon for great Yoga DVD's. Shiva Rea's new DVD is wonderful and well worth the extra money. I would recommend Sara Ivahoe's Candlelight Yoga over this one.",1104883200,4,496,4.755813953488372
2156063,3,B00049QQLE,"I enjoy Sara's laid-back personality, but unfortunately her instruction and her routine doesn't seem to suit any fitness level.  I agree with the previous reviewer; this is more ""stretching"" than ""sculpting"".  There are too few poses which are held too briefly to provide much benefit to any fitness level other than a very unfit beginner. Unfortunately, she doesn't give  enough detailed instruction to provide the beginner with a safe and effective practice, so I wouldn't recommend it for a beginner, either. A real significant problem with this video is in her instruction of the first pigeon pose, when the viewer is lunged forward on the right foot. Although she performs the pose properly, her verbal instructions are  to take the right foot and move it to the right. If anyone follows her verbal instruction, they're putting their knee  at risk for ligament injury. This is a serious error, and I can't believe that it wasn't caught and edited out.",1104883200,8,956,4.987421383647798

8036051,5,B00049QQLE,great for squeezing in your yoga. And Sara is terrific.,1424044800,,55,4.6
8036052,5,B00049QQLE,"Not only is she beautiful to look at but she has the perfect voice for a yoga video. It is very relaxing and gives you a nice stretch. This video is defiantly not a cardio work out though, so if you're trying to lose weight this isn't the best choice.",1418169600,,251,4.04
8036053,5,B00049QQLE,I like doing this dvd on the mornings before I go to work. It gives me a lift and gets my energy level up. Sara has a very calm and soothing voice. The twenty minutes just fly by.,1389484800,,179,3.736842105263158
8036054,5,B00049QQLE,Love Sara Ivanhoe's style and it was short but sweet. I would Definitely recommend it for beginners or intermediate yogis.,1367798400,,122,5.15
8036055,4,B00049QQLE,I like this video.  Sara does a great job of explaining poses and gives you adequate time to get into position.  I like that she balances out every pose on both sides of your body.  The only thing that I would suggest is holding some poses a little longer such a the temple pose sequence.  Overall I would recommend this video to others.,1363478400,2,337,4.301587301587301
8036056,5,B00049QQLE,"This is actually the second time I've bought this DVD, the first one was lost in the move.

Sara Ivanhoe is a great yoga instructor and her 20 minute yoga makeover series is a favorite of mine. I've had all 5 in the series for a number of years now and never get tired or annoyed by them. She has a very soothing voice and the poses move quickly with easier options for beginners (or those with restricting injuries like me). I really feel a difference in my body and feel calmer than when I do heavy impact workouts--and really, its only 20 minutes :)

I noticed on here that they now have all 5 available on one disk so make sure you don't double purchase them.",1359590400,,663,4.21259842519685

8036058,5,B00049QQLE,"If you have  Sara Ivanhoe's YOGA BODY MAKEOVER SERIES you don't need to get Sara Ivanhoe's YOGA MAKEOVER SCULPTED BUNS & THIGHS because it is already included in the YOGA BODY MAKEOVER SERIES except it is called Lower Body Power on the dvd.

Don't make the mistake i did and bought both dvd's and later realized the redundancy.

A SIDE NOTE:
It can get really confusing buying exercise videos because they always come out with another version. And ive accidentally bought dvds I already owned because they might change the packaging and make me believe that its a new product.

Other than that, sara ivanhoe is awesome. Wonderful teacher and down-to-earth. She is great! I'd highly recommend it.",1334793600,2,695,4.864406779661017
8036059,5,B00049QQLE,"Sara Ivanhoe leads you through this 20 minute practice focused on the lower body, which is the area that I need the most help in so I was glad to pick this one up.  The setting is terrific, the ocean and mountains are behind Sara, very colorful.  The music is soft and nothing special but it suits the practice fine.

The first part of the practice starts out standing, you will warm up with a variety of chair poses, each with a different arm position.  Then you will move into a series consisting of triangle, half moon and warrior, followed by a series of temple and fan poses, again with different arm positions.  Then you will move to the floor, starting with camel pose, then you will move into a lunge stretch later adding a twist. Then you will finish out with pigeon and a stretch for the outer hips before repeating the series on the other side, this time ending in cobblers pose. Finally Sara leads you through a mudra which completes the yoga practice.

I like this routine a lot, it's not very difficult but I find it refreshing and relaxing in a way, not sure if it will sculpt your buns and thighs but it will certainly stretch them out.  Yes, it is short but these days I am finding it difficult to fit in yoga at all so I am grateful for these short yoga practices.  Sara is my favorite yoga instructor, I seem to click with her style well, she is friendly, encouraging and non intimidating which I like.  Highly recommended.",1180224000,2,1442,4.390977443609023
8036060,5,B00049QQLE,"Can I just say that I love Sara Ivanhoe. She is a yoga-for-beginners genius!. I have never done yoga, yet her videos are so easy to learn and benefit from. I am already seeing improvement on my body and my progress toward being more flexible. I have done her videos virtually every day for the past month and love yoga now. It is true what they say about yoga. My food cravings have lessened, my dieting has gotten much easier, my stomache is almost flat, and my self esteem is much better. Great way to get into Yoga!",1162166400,3,518,4.295918367346939
