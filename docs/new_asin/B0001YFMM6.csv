8607152,4,B0001YFMM6,"I would add to some of the definitions presented here regarding the word/title ""Affluenza"".  An apt definition/interpretation would be the ""sickness of the wealthy"" (from a combination of the words ""influenza - the ""flu"" - and ""affluence""), especially as it is applied to those in their late teens to early and mid twenties. So accustomed to the wealth that surrounds them, having been ""born to the purple"" so to speak, we are made privy to the lives of these various individuals who act as if they are above it all and answerable to none just because they are so rich. The back cover of the DVD even proclaims: ""FILTHY RICH, MORALLY BANKRUPT"".  A recent criminal case in the news actually used the ""Affluenza"" defense to excuse the antics of one young man, blaming the wealthy environment that he grew up in for his misbehavior. This film attempts to shed a spotlight on what happens when that wealth is swept away in an instant thanks to sudden changes in the economic world and the collapse of the stock market (as it really did in
2008-2009). Naturally, this is a crushing blow in more ways than one and glaringly shows how unprepared particular individuals are/were when something like this happens.  They act as if their lives are over - and, in a way, this is true.  It is their WAY of life that is over.  Now comes the question: how will they respond to all this?  This is the sum and substance of  ""Affluenza"".  While it does reveal that even older generations are affected and act in a certain way, the focus of the film is primarily on the younger set. One major shortcoming of this movie in my opinion is that it gives one the impression that all wealthy youngsters of a particular age act this way. This is certainly untrue and unfair.  Many become philanthropists, truly respect their wealth in a healthy way and act accordingly.  Of course, as the old saying goes, ""the rich are different"".  But you can't blame them for it. Money and what it can buy does make the world go round and ""Affluenza"" must be approached on its own terms.  That does not mean that snobbery or bad behavior should be excused outright.  Absolutely not!  This film is an appropriate psychological study of what happens when wealth that was always a part of one's life or a major controlling factor is suddenly erased and possibly irretrievable.

For this reviewer, the appearance of particular actors in key roles such as Grant Gustin (The Flash, Glee, etc.) made it worthwhile. This fine but often overlooked actor with goatee and moustache once again showcased the variety of his acting talents. Ben Rosenfield, Samantha Mathis, and Steve Guttenberg also contributed quite well to this film. Recommended with a word of caution. At times, you may feel like you were forced to be a voyeur against your will and/or you may also feel a bit queasy at the spectacle, But, that's life.",1464307200,,2869,4.687250996015936

8607155,3,B0001YFMM6,"AS THE TITLE ITSELF EXPLAINS, IT'S ABOUT A CONDITION CALLED ""AFFLUENZA""... NOT TEEN ANGST.  IT'S ABOUT THE ""LAW OF THE JUNGLE""... NOT GREAT GATSBY

A MORALISTIC MOVIE THAT CONVEYS AN IMAGE, BUT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE POWERFUL WITH ITS INTENDED MEANING AND CONVEYANCE --- FILM MAKES CLEAR REFERENCE TO KIPLING'S LAW OF THE JUNGLE IN THE OPENING AND CLOSING SCENES.

This pros and cons review is intended to give some context.  I am trying to help both those who might like it, and those who will not.  There has been a great deal of misunderstanding of it's true references and meaning. The Gatsby comparison is utterly wrong. I don't know if the studio encouraged that comparison, but that would be a mistake. There are certain settings and scenes which are somewhat reminiscent, but the story is entirely different.  The Gatsby comparison, as near as I can tell, was started or perpetuated by professional movie critics and has inflated expectations. I am a fan of Gatsby and I would not compare these two. It's unfair.  ""Teen angst"" is also the wrong description as the title ""Affluenza"" clearly tells you what is troubling the people in this film.  My main critique is that the movie chooses a very lofty moralistic goal which has a high bar for delivery. Despite excellent performances (above the level of the movie's small budget at least) the story itself maybe doesn't feel as powerful as it should. It delivers something, but maybe doesn't deliver on the level it promises.

THE PLOT (no spoilers): 2008 (before the financial crisis) Fisher Miller moves in with his wealthy Long Island uncle's family for the summer. He seeks connections and acceptance into a prestigious school to study photography. His connections for marijuana, his talent photography, and proximity to wealth land him invitations to social situations he would normally never have. His beautiful cousin Kate is resistant to him at first, but comes to appreciate him as her friends also take to him somewhat warmly. It is a procession of excess with sex (no nudity), alcohol and drugs - including the parents. As I said, this is not angst. The kids may dislike their parents for various reasons, but they are NOT filed with angst.  They MORE than love their privileged lives and social status. Most are quite happy with their beautiful looks, gorgeous homes, and lack of oversight from their parents.  This is exactly what prevents them from seeing the negative reality of their lives. There is a convoluted twining of relationships that reveal people's true personalities. All the while, a financial catastrophe looms which can strip away the sophistry to reveal who has real happiness and love... and who doesn't.

OTHER THOUGHTS: The movie makes no reference to Gatsby and actually quotes a paragraph from The Jungle Book explaining a Law of the Jungle. The gist of that line is that you may be proud of your accomplishments, but the jungle is vast and there is always a bigger fish (no matter how much wealth you accumulate). Though there is a certain shallow feel to the movie, that is part of the whole point, I was impressed that the actors nicely conveyed the pettiness and jealousy without overplaying the part into mere caricatures. I am not calling the movie subtle because excess is not subtle - by definition. However, each of their portrayals did present some authenticity. Conversely, the life they live might actually seem so attractive to some viewers (obviously not the more critical) that the story loses its sting. Though it's absolutely necessary to convey the wealth and privilege, it's in danger of loosing it's moral message at times. One of the definitions of affluenza is: ""excess, anxiety, waste, and overload brought on by the dogged pursuit of always trying to get more"". Another is ""a lack of understanding of one's circumstance specifically because of ones place of privilege"". I felt the movie conveyed that, though it could have done more with the lesson in the end. I was interested in the relationships between Fisher, his cousins and new friends. For those who can set aside some shortcomings, there is certainly still value in this film and it's performances. Though I am a huge fan of Fitzgerald/Gatsby (and think they are timeless), I wonder if perhaps people today now may relate to something more contemporary.",1422748800,3,4326,4.9353507565337
