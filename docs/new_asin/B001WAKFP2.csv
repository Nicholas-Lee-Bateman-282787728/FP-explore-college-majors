3825022,5,B001WAKFP2,"i have to admit that when i first heard of this film being produced i was more than skeptical. i thought it was going to be insane to try to reproduce the original documentary film.  but the ""reproduced"" scenes from the original ""grey gardens"" are mesmerizing and have been executed with astonishing pinpoint accuracy.  there are also flashback scenes to fill in the holes in the story line of the life that these two women shared.

both drew barrymore and jessica lange are dead on in their portrayals of big and little edie.",1240099200,54,526,4.634408602150538

3825038,4,B001WAKFP2,"Jessica Lange And Drew Barrymore did a great job depicting the volatile yet loving relationship between this mother/daughter relationship and some insight into how these women ended up living in squalor at the beautiful Grey Garden estates.

3825133,5,B001WAKFP2,Fantastic acting and the make up and design was flawless. I would honestly be hard pressed to figure out which was the real Big Edie when looking at pictures of her against the Jessica Lange version. It is uncanny.

3825160,5,B001WAKFP2,"I watched the documentary on Netflix but knew little of the history of these two women.  For me, big Edie's narcissism is so disturbing that only her death could give Little Edie the life she wanted. This movie is very well acted, and I highly recommend.",1472515200,,254,4.521739130434782
3825161,5,B001WAKFP2,Amazing portrayal of two women who literally lived in their own world.  I recommend seeing the documentary then the musical as well.  Great job by Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore-she nailed little Edie.,1469577600,,203,5.121212121212121

3825179,5,B001WAKFP2,"I'm from Boston Mass so I am partial to Kennedy Family history. But don't let that sway you away. This movie is about the unfortunate Kennedy relative. Kind of sad, but funny at the same time.  I watch it about 1x/year.  I prefer the original, but since I have this one, I watch it.",1466640000,,282,4.203703703703703
3825180,5,B001WAKFP2,A good film,1466467200,,11,3.0
3825181,4,B001WAKFP2,"I really enjoyed this 2009 version of GREY GARDENS. Since the 1970s original is such a cult-classic, I was skeptical whether this would be any good, but from the opening scene when I saw how pitch-perfect Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange were in the roles as the two downtrodden Beale ladies, I was not disappointed.

Drew especially nails Edies accent and inflections and it was wonderful to have the movie fill in the blanks that were left in the original. After watching it, youll know how and why Edie came to wear those makeshift scarves and why the women are crippled by co-dependency. The film does take some liberties with the original. They recreate some classic scenes word-for-word, but change others to fit the needs of the script.  For example, the scene where Edie lined the dusty dining room chairs with newspaper for her guests was at Mamas birthday party, yet this film has her doing this outdoors on patio chairs when Jackie O comes calling to help them out of squalor.

Otherwise, fans of the original will be delighted with this retelling.",1465948800,,1059,4.775956284153006

Drew was a total surprise, she really nailed it as well!  I saw this version first, then the original afterwards, this one is much more entertaining start to finish--it grabs you.  The original is like a train-wreck you can't stop watching, but then the questions about how did this happen to these women(?) begins to get answered here with a look at their beginnings.",1462579200,,530,4.791208791208791

It's funny, at times; certainly poignant...to say the least...a brief look at a time long gone...dramatised to be sure, but the drama here pales in light of the real life story...Above all...it's about two people and their relationship which is obviously symbiotic, with each alternating between parent and child, but ultimately, a relationship - somehow - based on love...Make Sure you see the Maysles brothers original documentary. Please don't see either film if you're given to Judging people and situations about which you know Nothing... Take Care!",1462492800,4,801,5.209302325581396

3825267,5,B001WAKFP2,"This is by far better than I ever expected it to be! It really is a movie inside a movie as it covers the making of the Indy film ''Grey Gardens'' back in the 80's and or 90's.
As may be known by most, these ladies were the arty and eccentric Aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. There are many flashbacks to the past of these women's' lives, and what brought them to what the film shows as their current circumstances. The film maker brothers at first seem to want to exploit them, but these gals are smart, as well as eccentric. We see in the story the why's and the when's and the who's of their lives. We learn more about the East Coast rich and famous, especially of the 30's and 40's venue. We see who comes to their rescue, in a somewhat distant way, probably for 'appearances'.
This movie is worth the time, and money, and could I even say.... the compassion, to watch. It will take most of us to a different place. We will even learn more of the fate of the old estate itself. But most of all we will learn of the lives of two sweet souls whose lives stated out so much different than most, and ended up so much different than most of us. ( Or did they? )",1461456000,2,1182,4.143478260869565

3825271,5,B001WAKFP2,"Then watch this HBO production; and you will appreciate even more how brilliant and uncanny Jessica Lange is as ""Big Edie.""  It's almost supernatural to watch her capture the essence and spirit of Big Edie.  This is no mere performance; she totally inhabits the woman; she becomes her (watch the ""Tea for Two"" number and be amazed!).  And this isn't the first time Lange pulls that off; she does it with Patsy Cline and Francis Farmer.  At this point in her career, you expect Lange to be brilliant - and from Francis (ok, I may be in the minority here, but I even liked her in King Kong; I knew there was more there than what we were seeing in that film) through AHS:  Freak Show - well, she is amazing.  And I look forward to seeing her in O'Neill's ""Long Days Journey Into Night"" in May on Broadway.

But the real revelation here, for me anyway, is Barrymore.  Nothing, NOTHING, she has done previously will prepare you for what she does in this film.  She is miraculous.  Again, only if you watch the original documentary can you appreciate how Barrymore inhabits this character completely;  from the voice, to the costumes, to the mannerisms.  For me anyway, this performance came out of nowhere.  She is brilliant.

I can never argue with Lange winning an Emmy but If there was ever a time when it should have been a tie, this was it.  And since it did come down to either/or, I personally would have gone with Barrymore.  Not because she's necessarily ""better"" than Lange, but simply because her's is the most surprisingly astounding performance.

I can't recommend both ""Grey Gardens"" enough.",1461196800,3,1600,4.637010676156583

3825289,3,B001WAKFP2,"The Bovier family and the Kennedys seemed to have it all when I was a teenager, and the tragedies rhat played out were so closely followed throughout my adult years, especially because I spent many happy summers on Cape Cod and identified with the New England lifestyle lived by the Kennedy family.  I was much more informed about them as were most people I imagine, but being so close to Rhode Island also  where the Bouviers lived was also a factor.  Jackie and Lee were fascinating and to me, as interesting as any movie idols.

I had heard in later years about Long Island relatives of the Bouviers who had lived at Grey Gardens.  I was, therefore, fascinated by the film.  The characters so well drawn, and the superb acting kept my attention and filled in a lot of information I had not ever known.  I think the study of the characters, even if one were not interested in the family, is compelling.

Sometimes, there is just nothing one can do, and sadly, the 2 women (mother and daughter) play this out so well.",1461024000,,1018,4.494565217391305
3825290,5,B001WAKFP2,"Having watched the Documentary many years ago, I was so excited to see what they could add to this interesting and poignant film by the Maysles.
Well, they added just enough.....some background of the Edies from days of their prime, etc which made into a wonderful, interesting movie about the Beale-Bouvier family.
Both actresses enveloped their roles to the point where I honestly at some moments could not tell if they had thrown in footage from the docu. Both Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore were nominated for Emmies for Best Actress and Lange won. I felt it could have been a TIE. Whoever casted this film knew exactly who to place where. Even Jean Tripplehorn as Jackie O was a well thought out casting decision.
I loved how the new film would change the medium of the movie (from digital to film) when an exact scene from the docu was being planned out.
It's a sad story, but uplifting in a crazy sort of way. For you see, little Edie was so way ahead of her time and this passion for acting was stifled by her mother. Yet, she never, in the end, really blamed her mother (Big Edie).
I hold Grey Gardens as one of the Top 10 films I have seen in my life. A perfect film with Bravura performances, scenery, costumes,...Just Perfect. It is the only film I watched on my computer, because it was no longer offered by HBO on U-Verse.",1461024000,,1338,4.46530612244898

3825303,4,B001WAKFP2,"Ugh.... so many tears. Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange deliver a wonderful, unforgettable and amazing performance.
Also, everytime i looked at the screen I almost teared up. Like i said, so many tears.
When I first looked at this movie cover i thought, meh, why is Drew Barrymore in a movie like this, but... as i'd watched it, i realized it was nothing like what i was expected whatsoever. If i was to explain this movie in three words I would use words like eccentric, sad, happy.
Although happy wouldn't be the main word i'd use. So, what is this movie about you might ask. Well, it is about a girl who had big dreams, and is sent to New York with her father, that is until her mother gets her home, and they become recluses.
Now, let's talk about the characters. Both of them had such depth. And i am glad that we got to see their backstories unlike the documentary, not saying that the documentary is bad, but i do think that you should watch that first and then watch this second.
So, i think i really need to talk about Edie, because oh hot damn she was all sorts of interesting. Lets start off with her personality, that was the part that mostly drew me into the movie overall. In the beginning of the movie, i observed Edie for the most part. I think eccentric people are extremely interesting and kindhearted, so this movie worked out well for me at the get-go. But Edie's life and her personality made me cry also, her personality wasn't bad, it's just that she's spent all these years in this house, and she wants so badly to perform. But as you look at the crumbling house around her, you begin to realize that it's a little too late, or is it? I was so happy about how Edie got to perform at the end, she really shined and I almost started to cry again. Overall, Edie is a tearjerker, because when you look at her, you feel that young person inside her soul wanting so badly to be released. Well, at least that's what I felt while watching the movie. Now, onto Edie's mother. Now, after a while Edie's mother really started to piss me off. I just couldn't help it, I just couldn't contain it. Edie's mother is just sooo manipulative and so horrible. I'm sorry, i'm just pissed at her for what she did to Edie. Anyway, Edie's mother NEEDS her own book. It's just meant to happen, although outside the movie, Edie's mother is actually dead. But still, someone should try to write a book about her. Now, when Edie was going to New York i immediately had suspicions that her mother was going to fcuk it all up, because, let's be honest, she does that through most the movie. And doesn't really have a clean slate in my opinion. I don't know, I just feel like her mother has A LOT and by a lot i mean A BUCKET LOAD OF PROBLEMS. You know when you watch a movie and someone's psychological issues mess with another's life completely. Well, in Grey Garden's case, that's EXACTLY what happened. and I HATE IT. Yes, i used the word. But it was the mother's choice and Edie's choice, I mean think about it, Edie didn't have to go home, and Edie's mom didn't even have to make the call in the first place. PROBLEM SOLVED! P.S. That didn't happen.

Overall, this movie was really good, and I give it a four stars. I highly recommend it, but I shall warn you, you will be bathing in an ocean of tears when the credits come up. Just like I did.",1460332800,,3344,4.31637519872814

On the other hand, in many places it seemed that they were simply re-enacting scenes from the documentary, and without the electricity of the original.

Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised! Both Lange and Barrymore channel Edith and 'Little Edie' quite easily, which was an absolute pleasure to watch. The film is heartbreaking at times as you are cognizant that the root of the film is actually tied to personal accounts filmed in the original Grey Gardens movie; however, it is uplifting at other times, perhaps most particularly due to Drew Barrymore's seemingly positive embracing of her situation and an unfailing love for her mother. This is a must see, for sure.

I had to keep reminding myself that it was actually her because she immersed herself so well in the character.  Drew was wonderful as little Edie allowing us to really feel their hopes, their plights, their sorrows. I've always been fascinated with the Kennedy family and just recently came upon the Grey Gardens documentary through FB (of all places).

3825497,5,B001WAKFP2,"The original Grey Gardens documentary was so many things at once:  absurdist performance art, cautionary tale, family psychodrama, camp classic, and proto-reality show. The lack of editorializing and background information allowed the Beales to speak for themselves, reaching different viewers in different ways, but pretty much everybody left the movie wondering how the Edies fell so far so fast.  This fictionalized version attempts to fill in some of those gaps, and I think it does that much more convincingly than the musical. The question of how and why Little Edie abandoned her New York dreams is answered in some very powerful scenes that function as turning points.  Watching this movie a second time, I was impressed by small details showing how Grey Gardens changed over time; we are shown little seeds of big disasters and watch them gradually grow, so the unthinkable becomes plausible, if no less tragic.  Lange disappears so completely inside Big Edie that I felt like I was watching the real person, and Barrymore gives Little Edie dignity by showing us her familiar mannerisms in the radiance of her youth, when her eager vamping really did have the effect she intended.  We can see that she's not deluded; she's just stuck in a time warp and resentful to be there.  The film does a great job of capturing not only the conflict between the mother and the daughter, but also a powerful, enduring love that maybe, just maybe, made it all worth it.",1451433600,3,1464,4.930894308943089

The added flashback scenes are based on Little Edie's diaries and letters, so this film gives us the benefit of some answered questions that remained unresolved at the end of the documentary. Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore are brilliant, and I had my doubts about whether anyone could capture The Edies' spirit, eccentricity, and vulnerability.

3825554,4,B001WAKFP2,"Very strange story.  I guess it is a true story.  I don't remember hearing anything about Grey Gardens and the two Edies before.  Very sad to see the mental illness destroy them both.  It makes me wonder how it actually happens.  It was an odd co-dependency between mother and daughter.  The acting was superb but the movie was very depressing.  Don't watch this if you are down in the dumps. Watch it on a pretty sunny day, and remember  that even though it is a true story, it is only a movie.  It is just a shame that nobody got them help.  We still have a long way to go in the area of mental health.  I think it should rank up with cancer as something that needs to be studied and to come up with  some new treatments.  I realize that steps have been made since this situation occurred, but there are still many improvements needed for people with mental health issues.",1445558400,,874,4.288343558282208

There wasn't any background for the documentary, they just assumed you knew who these people were and what their lives had been like.

3825735,5,B001WAKFP2,"The characters in this film are truly strange ducks, but the acting is delightful. Drew Barrymore gives a virtuoso performance as the increasingly disturbed daughter of an extremely eccentric (to put it mildly) has-been socialite, played by Jessica Lange. Based on a true story, the downfall of Grey Gardens and its inhabitants is strangely touching, filled with pathos, and yet not, in the end, satisfactorily explained. Nevertheless, it has its bright spots--such as an appearance of cousin Jackie O., played surprisingly well--and the childlike optimism of Barrymore's character, young Edith. You can't help but cheer her on at the end. I would likely watch this again, and that's saying something right there.",1439510400,,713,5.375

3825738,4,B001WAKFP2,Having seen the 1975 documentary I was curious to see how these 'characters' were portrayed. Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange did not disappoint. Good movie.,1439078400,,157,5.32

3825767,3,B001WAKFP2,"Jessica Lange & my favorite, Drew Barrymore.  Great acting - but a downer to watch their closeness be their downfall.  Not to mention living in squalor.  Pretty sad to think that Jackie' O didn't get involved with her aunt early on to see how they were living.  Sad, too, that Barrymore's character, both named Edith, the daughter, couldn't break away from her mother's control and lead her own life.  But that was the story and supposed to be a true one.",1438300800,,455,4.567901234567901

3825770,5,B001WAKFP2,The acting and the story are both quite good. I especially like it because it is a true story. I learned about the film from a segment on CBS Sunday morning.,1437868800,,157,4.096774193548387

8347322,5,B001WAKFP2,"Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore are delightful and so similar to the actual documentary. This story is obsessively fascinating. If I ever end up with another cat, I will have a cat named Edie. If I have two they will be Edie and Little Edie. These ladies... Bless their hearts. The whole thing is just out of this world crazy... wonderful... But, freaking crazy. Also, there was a musical, did you know? ""Jerry likes my corn"" is my favorite song of them all...",1523836800,,461,4.566265060240964
