7914980,5,B00001U0EX,"What a great combination of music and skating!! The audio/video quality is outstanding. The scenery was breathtaking especially when Jim Brickman  played the piano on snowed field(or lake) in the sunset. I love Windham  Hill music. This dvd has bunch of special features including two multiple  angle tracks, which I liked very much. This definitely is worth buying for  you and your family.",940982400,14,391,5.158730158730159
