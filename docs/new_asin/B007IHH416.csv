I don't mind a cheap movie with an interesting plot, or an expensive movie without a great plot but some compelling visuals, but this movie has nothing going for it. It barely has a plot. It is incredibly low budget (there are high school films that look better than this,and the budget was estimated at $200,000). Edward X. Young (who was in 10 films in 2014) tries to give this film a spark as the title character......but the movie's tone switches from unpleasant, low-budget slasher to campy horror (not the good kind) by the end. And the end? One of the worst you'll see.",1425168000,2,673,4.570247933884297

5089037,3,B007IHH416,"MR. HUSH (2011) - If you can get pass the cheapness of the entire production, including questionable acting from nearly all the cast members, you may find yourself having a good time with this strange horror flick. Ten years ago, Holland Price (stuntman/actor Brad Loree, who looks like a young Richard Moll and played Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION - 2002) was a loving father of young daughter Amy and devoted husband to beautiful wife Julie (Jessica Cameron). On Halloween Night, the last visitor to ring the doorbell to the Price household is Father Flannagan (Edward X. Young; MEGA MAN - 2009, who bears a striking resemblance to a young Zacherle), who assures Holland that he is not wearing a costume and that his bus (which he says is full of orphans) conked out about a half mile away. He wants to use the phone to call for help, but first needs to use the bathroom. The next time we see Father Flannagan, he is holding a butcher knife to Julie's throat and slashes it in front of Holland. Amy ends up missing and Father Flannagan gets away, promising they will meet again before he knocks out Holland. Cut to the present and Holland (now with long gray hair) is living in a tent next to new buddy Mac (Steve Dash), making money working as a dishwasher and waiter at a bar/restaurant with fellow waitress Debbie (Connie Giordano). Mac wants Holland to put down roots and settle down with Debbie and her daughter Kat (Alexis Lauren), but Holland is sure that Amy is alive and never spends more than two weeks in one place looking for her (that explains the tent). Holland eventually falls in love with Debbie and gets along great with Kat, but Father Flannagan rings the doorbell to Debbie's house, slits Debbie's throat and ties Holland and Kat up in a basement, where Flannagan's assistant, Stark (actor/former gay porn film star Stephen Geoffreys; FRIGHT NIGHT - 1985, who overacts here to the point of diversion for the viewer) torments them verbally. Holland swears to Kat that they will get free and calls Flannagan ""Mr. Hush"", because he likes to sing the song ""Hush Little Baby"". Holland and Kat watch as Hush and Stark bring in some unknown girl, tie her to a table and slowly drain her of blood by putting a tube in her arm and letting her blood drain into a bowl. Holland and Kat finally get free and while Kat goes to get the police, Holland searches the house to kill Hush. He manages to kill Stark and finds his now-teenage daughter Amy (Megan Heckman) in one of the upstairs bedrooms, but Mr. Hush has a hold on her and demands she goes back to her bedroom. She does just that and Holland demands to know why Hush has such a hard-on for him: Hush explains that in the 1930's, he and his wife were out for a midnight stroll looking for dinner when Holland's grandfather lost control of his car, crashed into a picket fence and one of the pickets flew in the air and impaled Hush's wife in the heart, killing her. Since Hush looks no older than 45, it soon becomes apparent that Hush and his wife were vampires and Hush swore that Holland's bloodline would suffer a fate worse than death. Namely, he killed Holland's grandparents, parents and makes Holland suffer by killing everyone that he loves. Hush then shows his true colors (mainly blue), as he transforms into a vampire with a full set of sharp upper and lower teeth. Holland tries to hit him with a baseball bat, but it just splinters when he hits Hush over the head with it. Just as he is about to kill Holland, Hush is impaled with the sharp end of the baseball bat, courtesy of Amy (Hush says, ""Isn't that funny? A vampire killed with his own bat!"") and he stumbles outside where we hear the sound of bat wings flying away. A year later, Holland, Amy, Kat and Mac are living peacefully in a house when the doorbell rings. Mac goes to answer the door when the other three scream to him, ""NO!!!!"".  While not a good film at all, it is still an interesting one and director/screenwriter/executive producer David Lee Madison (his first and, so far, only directorial effort) works pretty well in the confines of what he has to work with; namely a meager budget, non-professional actors (besides Geoffreys) and limited locations and sets. There's not much blood spilled (just a couple of slit throats, a knifing, threatening to cut off the head of the unknown girl with a chainsaw [the film's biggest tease, because Hush turns off the chainsaw just as we are expecting him to cut her head off], a bloodless impalement and the aforementioned bleeding of the unknown girl), but the story really doesn't demand it. There's a stinger during the end credits that tries to emulate Geoffreys' final line in FRIGHT NIGHT (Only this time he says, ""Smells like chicken!"", a line he says a couple of times during the film proper when he sniffs people). Speaking of Geoffreys, he has not progressed as an actor but actually regressed, because his performance here is one of the worst in the film (not to mention his prominent beer belly). He overacts to the point of wanting to duct tape his mouth and chaining his legs together, as he jumps and screams all over the place in one scene and he is only reading a newspaper! I will give this film one positive point and that is it is different from most ultra-low-budget DTV junk being released today. That's not an endorsement, but you could do a helluva lot worse. Also starring Thomas J. Churchill (as one of the most worthless sheriffs committed to film), Tim Doughtery, Colleen Cohan and Brian O'Halloran. A Horizon Movies DVD/Blu-Ray Release.

5089039,1,B007IHH416,I really wanted to see this film. What got me to buy it was the hype. I was very disappointed in my purchase. The acting is horrible and laughable. It was a complete waste of time to sit through it. Please don't buy this film. If you want to see it rent it. Or watch it on Netflix or something.

5089040,1,B007IHH416,"I really wanted to like MR. HUSH. I enjoy a good, solid slasher film as much as anyone. However, the sad fact is that this movie has some of the worst acting I've seen in a while. I am talking about acting that never allows you to believe that what you are watching is anything other than unskilled actors, woodenly reciting their lines. Never mind the characters or dialogue, the performances are enough to destroy any sense of the ""suspension of disbelief""! I even stuck w/ it until the bitter end, hoping for some redeeming quality. Alas, the story is mediocre, the killer is a non-frightening, self-parody, and the hero is a boob. A damned shame. MR. HUSH is a low-low-budget film. I never hold a movie's lack of budget against it. Some of the best horror movies ever made had rock-bottom budgets. Nope, it's all about a good story, and making it believable...",1365465600,2,864,4.616883116883117

5089045,1,B007IHH416,"A man searching for ten years for the killer of his wife and kidnapper of his child, finds him but not in the way he is hoping.

The 'mystery' of who or what Mr. Hush is can be guessed within the first eleven minutes into the film and only that long before he doesn't even show up until then 10 minute mark. That's 10 agonizing minutes of nothing happening. The only thing more dreadfully boring then those first ten minutes is the remaining part of the film. For extra masochistic points one could even stay after the credits for even more of this awful film, but I don't think anyone other then me would be that self-loathing as to do something as silly as that.",1345420800,8,664,4.312

Great campy over the top performances by Stephen Geoffreys (Fright Night), and Edward X Young make for an 80's styled classic romp.

I forgot I even had it on. If you want to torture yourself for 1 hour & 20+ minutes then I suggest you watch this movie,1432080000,2,465,4.177777777777778
