8146197,3,B000ILZ6FU,I'm just hoping it was the device I tried to put it in but it skips past a lot of parts.,1364342400,,88,3.238095238095238
8146198,2,B000ILZ6FU,"I love Madonna Grimes and think her workouts are great. But this video appears to be a bad transfer from an old VHS, and the quality is so poor it's nearly unbearable.",1363392000,,167,4.25
8146199,4,B000ILZ6FU,"This is an obvious bad copy of a VHS. Set in a workout room w/wood floors & mirror on your right, you feel like you're in a small class w/Madonna & her 6 girlfriends. They have fun making jokes, etc. but always keep you moving. it relaxes you & you really get into the dance because of Madonna's great body awareness & friendly & fun personality.
The only problem with this is the editing & camerawork. The camera changes to weird angles or flashes to just this person's face or that & makes it harder to learn, though Madonna teaches well. Also, something went wrong with the exposure? that there are slight scan lines & people look like there are several copies of themselves when they move quick, like a computer running slow or very weak video card. It's not terrible, but just slightly annoying. It is still more then clear enough to see w/o straining, just not high production. As another said, even though there are 6 women (who dance well, though I admit, I only concentrate on Madonna, but I always notice bad dancers), 90% of the time, you only see the middle 4 behind Madonna.
You get a short warm-up, and learn choreography & then cool down in 30 min. Madonna teaches in 1/4 - 1/2 speed several times, then full tempo several times before teaching you the next. She has you repeat the previous moves once you've practiced the new move.  The moves themselves are early-mid 90s old school hip hop. Mostly body rolls, knees in/out quickly, V step & hip bumps.

You can find a 6 min clip on youtube on BeYOUtv's channel under: ""Sista's of Soul - Hip Hop Workout""
This shows the teaching/practice of the 3rd set of moves of the choreography portion in it's entirety practically. What you would have seen after that clip is her then linking that to the rest of the routine slow several times & then fast.

There are other clips on youtube of her workouts if you look up her name or Dance Street Hip Hop.",1257724800,,1909,4.464183381088826
8146200,4,B000ILZ6FU,"I like Madonna Grimes' dance workout videos. You find your self moving along to fun music, exercising, and along the way looking cool as you learn new dance steps. I bout about 4 dvds from her dance street series. She's alot of fun to learn from.",1233360000,,246,4.369565217391305
8146201,1,B000ILZ6FU,"The videos are filmed and edited so poorly that I couldn't finish them, you can't even see her face. Several of her backup dancers don't know what to do. I was severally unimpressed.",1198108800,3,182,4.545454545454546
8146202,4,B000ILZ6FU,I liked this workout video but I thought that it was too short- only 30 minutes to the whole video.  The filming was poor quality and they had weird shots to the other dancers that cut away from actually learning the routine.  MaDonna Grimes was great though.,1173139200,5,259,4.48936170212766
