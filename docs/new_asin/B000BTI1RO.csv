2441057,5,B000BTI1RO,"i loved this video- a bit difficult if u don't have a dance background, would not recommend for beginners!",1233187200,6,106,4.631578947368421
2441058,1,B000BTI1RO,Ok this is a great video for beginners but I felt that it being a Vol. 2 it should have offered more. Alot of these instructional dance dvd's are real cheesy and this was one of them.. the best part was at the end when they do a routine with popping and ticking. Which they don't even give instructions on.. all the routines with instructions were sooooo Lame. I would not recommend this for those who are hard core Hip hop dancers. I would go to Digitaldancers.com because the real deal is on there.,1222992000,3,500,4.329787234042553
2441059,4,B000BTI1RO,"In 2002, the original Darrin's Dance Grooves sold over 3 million copies, won the Billboard Award for Best Selling Health and Fitness Video and was named ""the biggest selling television advertised product in 2002."" With numbers and accolades like that, it was only a matter of time before Darrin graced the public with a second volume. In a summer box office filled with sequels and trilogies, Americans are used to getting a second (or even third) helping of the things they enjoy. On June 12th, fans of Darrin Henson will get a second helping of dance instruction from their favorite ""choreographer to the stars"".

Darrin's Dance Grooves 2 showcases the spirited choreographer's unique style of fitness/dance. Like most fitness videos, it starts out with a brief warm-up, Darrin reminding viewers to always stretch before doing any exercise, even dancing.  As Darrin slowly walks the viewer through each move, often repeating each step several times and offering words of encouragement, even beginners are able to follow along. But this video is not just for beginners. As the DVD progresses, the dances slowly get more complicated and physically demanding, ensuring that even seasoned dancers will find something useful here.

Darrin's positive reinforcement and upbeat attitude helps keep viewers from getting down on themselves if they can't pick the moves up right away. Although Darrin is the leader in this video, he doesn't let his ego overshadow the rest of the talent here. He's also brought in two new teams of choreographers: the Spellman Sisters, who lead an all-female dance, and Adesola and Antoine, who lead an all-male dance. Each of their dances is a little bit more difficult than the first one led by Darrin. Darrin even takes the time to let each of the background dancers in his video introduce themselves and say where they're from.

Although the DVD case advertises five new dance sequences, there are really only four here. Darrin leads two, and the aforementioned choreographer teams each lead one. At the end Darrin does a bit of a showcase in a segment called Poppin'. If anyone had any question up to this point about Darrin's abilities, they need only fast forward to the last few minutes of the disc and watch as Darrin blows your mind with impossibly smooth robotic moves. He's clearly the best in the business, but instead of looking down on the rest of us, he's glad to share his knowledge. (I'm sure it doesn't exactly hurt him financially either). The DVD also includes information about getting headshots and making a resume, but there are many better resources for that information, although the tips presented here will set people on the right track if they have no idea where to start.

Clocking in at just over an hour, Darrin's Dance Grooves 2 offers enough of a workout for most dancers, and can hopefully teach everyone something they didn't know, or at least make them feel more confident in their dancing ability. The production value of the video itself is pretty typical of most fitness videos, a big empty studio with several camera angles running at once and edited together later. Here, the format works perfectly in this no-frills dance class. The first volume was clearly a huge success, and by keeping his instructions beginner-friendly while still maintaining a high level of quality and intensity in his routines, Darrin seems destined to repeat his success with this second volume.",1181260800,7,3438,4.993019197207679
2441060,5,B000BTI1RO,"After seeing STOMP THE YARD (and being an experienced dancer myself), I realized I needed to step my game up! Darrin Henson, who did his THING in the movie really provides a pretty dope instructional. My main thing as a dancer is FOOTWORK, BODY ISOLATIONS, ARMWORK...Darrin does it all.

I had a chance to see the final copy and was pretty impressed with how he takes each move, locks in several more and ties them all into a routine pretty seamlessly.

He presents it in a way that is simple enough for beginners or dancers with little experience but flows well enough to not lose more experienced dancers.

There is also some bonus ( I say bonus because I have never seen this in a Dance Instructional) features on how to ""market"" yourself in the dance world..I love dancing, but this gave me some ideas on how to maybe go after some gigs..even info on headshots?! A great DVD!",1181001600,6,879,4.515723270440252
2441061,5,B000BTI1RO,"Darrin's Dance Grooves Part 2 is by far THE BEST instructional video I have ever bought. My brother and I love learning all the moves. Its not to fast & not to slow. They break it down and show both the front and the back views. Making it much easier to learn!

Darrin Henson and the other choreographers have cutting edge moves. I personally do it more for exercise, but my brother does it so he has some dance moves when he goes out on the weekends.

I think wether you are getting the video for exercise, getting moves for the club, or because you are an aspiring dancer this tape will be benificial to you.

Definately a 5 star video!",1131408000,15,638,4.256198347107438
2441062,4,B000BTI1RO,"I've bought a lot of dance DVDs :-) and this is one of the best I've bought. The routines are good and even though sometimes a bit fast, and you have to pause and go back, it's way better than some of the other vids on the market that are just too fast to keep up. I got Darrin's first video and it was cool because it had lots on it about all the people he'd worked with like Britney, NSYNC and Jordan knight but it was way to fast for me. This is much better.... there are even views from the back.",1130457600,16,500,3.8640776699029127

8092410,3,B000BTI1RO,"This I bought because I loved the first volume. I grew up doing the dances from the first volume and bought the second one thinking it'd be just as amazing as the first one. It wasn't anywhere near as good as the first. The first had many great pop songs choreography the second one just didn't fit. It didn't have any music video choreography it was just a dance workout.  So, if you're looking for that I'd recommend this but if you're like me and  wanted this because the first one had more pop dance routines you won't get that here.",1445385600,,537,4.306930693069307

8092414,5,B000BTI1RO,"I bought the DVD because I watch Darrin Henson teach on a cruise. I didn't participate.
I decided to buy the DVD to learn at my own pace. I am still learning, love it. My
Grand daughter got onto it quit. Kudos",1403395200,2,209,4.0

8092416,2,B000BTI1RO,"This video has excellent potential, but unfortunately, I found it difficult to remember the moves. The problem is he teaches all the steps to the routine in one go, and then you dance it together. He doesn't teach a few steps and then go from the beginning and then add on some more and start from the beginning. You just learn some more and learn the next part and then learn the next part and then when you go to do it all together you have forgotten the first half.",1319760000,3,468,4.211111111111111
