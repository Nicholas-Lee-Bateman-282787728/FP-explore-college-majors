8502508,5,B006P0FILA,"This is the CBS broadcast (I was worried that it would be a different broadcast), featuring Billy Mac (Bill McAtee), Johnny Mac (John McEnroe), and Mary Carillo. Given the great age of tennis that we live in, these matches are classics to own & study (if you are an afficionado of tennis), particularly given the arc that these players have been on the past few years. It's terrific to see how they've changed in the intervening years. To make the viewing easier, the commercials have been removed, so the tennis flows smoothly from game to game.",1373673600,,546,4.697916666666667
8502509,5,B006P0FILA,"This was a great dvd with quality picture and sound covering the whole matches without commercial interruptions and annoying intervals.
 I remembered federer having two match points and not convering not even one although he served for the match at 40-15.
 Nole was very lucky striking a superb return exactly in to the line. the best return to a powerfull servis i've ever seen. then federer made a fault and the match was lost to nole.
 In the other semi final nadal won without problems and we had the classic final between nadal and nole.
 All in all this dvd was great and we expect more to come with more federer matches from the slams.",1368144000,2,642,4.556521739130435
