7989519,4,B000093NR2,"This isn't quite up with Il Posto, but Olmi's depiction of the decency of everyday people reminds us that we can still be like that, even in hard times.",1358467200,,152,4.275862068965517
7989520,3,B000093NR2,"Olmi's follow-up to the much better and more rewarding 'Il Posto', is an exercise in the old adage ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" gone awry. Sure, the cinematography's gorgeous, the acting fine, the set structure near perfect and the male lead is perfectly cast as the worker sent away from his small hometown to work in Sicily, where his wages and status will improve as a result, but the characters and plot are severely under-developed, IMHO.

My problems with this film are the fact that almost nothing happens for most of the movie, and the man's fianc is a horrible beast of a woman who resents his opportunity for advancement - she would rather he stay in their little town and they live in poverty out of her petty selfishness and small-mindedness rather than see a bigger picture and a brighter future on the horizon.

Too much sedentary down time makes this Italian neo-realist flick drag unbelievably until the love letters, tender and touching, are exchanged at the finale, but by then, I had a difficult time caring about the outcome. I believe the protagonist was too good for the woman who was ultimately going to make his life wretched, regardless of what he did after the final credits rolled. I infinitely preferred 'Seduced And Abandoned' for a similar neo-realist flick from the same time period, or 'Mama Roma', 'Umberto D.', 'Divorce Italian Style',  'Marriage Italian Style', 'Big Deal On Madonna Street', etc. over this one any time. ""Absence makes the heart grow fonder"", maybe, but only if I never sit through this one again.",1284854400,,1558,4.849624060150376
7989521,5,B000093NR2,"Criterion provide an 18 minute interview with Olmi, recorded in 2002, and the articulate and charming director provides insight into the genesis of his film - the industrialisation and economic boom in Italy in the 60's saw an upheaval in traditional customs and family life, especially in the poor agricultural areas, such as  much of Sicily (where part of the film is set); in the story this backdrop is counterpoised against the personal changes wrought upon a couple, separated by these circumstances.  They begin in stubborn silence and end in a heart-warming blossoming of articulate expression of their emotions and aspirations - the change sweeping through the nation has had its effect upon them.

Olmi speaks of his interest in presenting time in a novel way; he hopes to dissolve the distinctions between past, present and future, and segue from one to the next seamlessly, expecting the audience to intelligently follow his cues, and in so doing suggest the internal flow of time for his protagonist.  I think he succeeds, and the film becomes, if anything, more realistic through this fluid depiction of time.

The cinematography is wonderful, whether in its intimacy, or in its handling of spectacular views of industrial plants.  So too the pacing of scenes, the opening in particular being a joy of accumulated surprises, the tension building until the viewer is as eager for the musicians to play as the would-be dancers upon the screen.

Again in the interview, his collaborator speaks of Olmi's technical mastery of all aspects of film-making, his complete and utter disregard of commercial success, and his adherence to a policy of being honest with himself.  He made documentaries of the working people, and early on committed himself to the production of quality informative material for television, even when the latter meant interfering with, the more lucrative, ventures into feature film.

So here is a work of art from a master film-maker - utterly engaging and formally accomplished, with insight into the social situation of his country at the time, told through the guise of a satisfying traditional love story.  Criterion provide their customary perfect transfer and the mentioned bonus material.  Every bit as good as, and very much a companion piece to Il Posto, I Fidanzati is something of a neglected masterpiece.",1147046400,9,2348,5.136482939632546
7989522,4,B000093NR2,"Ermano is one of my favorite Italian  directors. The whole movie is really great. Ermano Olmi is one of the few directors that can take a plain story and make it more interesting than the biggest hollywood film. Just as long as you don't think like the average big hollywood production viewer.
I love how this film starts and I love how it ends.  Some incredible cinematography. Especially with the scene in the beginning where the main character is walking through the factory with the tarantella music playing in the background. Another great part of the film is the street party in Sicily. It amazes me how Ermano Olmi was able to direct the scenes so perfectly with such a tight large drunken crowd.",1084320000,8,703,4.661290322580645
