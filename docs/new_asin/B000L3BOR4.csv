I think these movies must have been made with the glitches and wavering soundtrack apparent on this DVD.  At least, when we were watching them in school fifty years ago, they looked and sounded the same then and they do on this DVD!  [Actually, I think the DVD is better - a school 16mm sound projector must not have been able to keep an even speed because the music would whine and wobble until it nearly left the realm of melody!]

For anyone in their sixties or early seventies, this DVD will bring back lots of memories.  Funny thing, however; they seemed a lot more sensible to my wife and me now than they did when we had to watch them in the late 1950s and early 1960s!  Back then, they seemed corny, even embarrassing to watch in a classroom full of potential dating partners!  If we actually did any of these suggestions, he or she would know you were following the movie!  So much for dating 'by the book!'

Still, there is a lot of practical information in these old movies that certainly would not hurt today's teenagers to see.  Parents might want to get a copy to watch with their kids to open up discussion about the various topics.  It could be both an amusing and edifying experience for both parents and teens.  I'd just suggest to avoid the embarrassment the first viewers of these movies experienced by not showing the movies to a classroom full friends!

So, this DVD is wonderful in two respects.  Historical in that they are the movies watched by the grandparents of many of today's teens.  It might help them understand Grandpa or Grandma's view of their dating.  And, it is a great way to bring up dating concerns that never change.  The way they are handled today may be different from how grandparents handled them, but I'm sure it is still just as difficult for a teen boy new to dating to ask a girl for a date or for a young teen girl to know what to talk about with a date as it was two generations back!",1207612800,,2045,4.339473684210526
