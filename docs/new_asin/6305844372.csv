7896269,5,6305844372,There have been various types of Mars movie made over the years. Escape from mars has had the least mentioned about it or didn't have the marketing budget like The Martian. This is a Paramount studio made film. Escape from mars is not the best Mars movie made but its not the worst ether. Its an in between movie that is very enjoyable to watch. Its defiantly worth watching if you like good science fiction movies about Mars.,1481673600,,426,4.4743589743589745

7896271,5,6305844372,We know more today then when the movie was made but it was realistic at the time.  I like the charactors and the meteor shower!,1364774400,,127,4.08
7896272,5,6305844372,"I bought this movie because I like the actor Micheal Shanks.  This was an older movie, and kind of low key, but still very good.  I never pay much for what I buy on Amazon.  I usually try to get the item for .01, and then pay about $4 for s&h.  I have been happy with each purchase.  Liquorish",1342483200,,293,3.8983050847457625
7896273,2,6305844372,"I received the VHS tape well before the deadline and was greatly looking forward to viewing it.  I love sci-fi movies and like several of the actors.  I should have gotten a clue when I couldn't get the movie on DVD, only VHS.

The premise of the movie is a trip to and from Mars which was to cover about two years and the astronauts were all volunteers for the trip.  However, all but two of the characters whined and complained the whole movie.  And the two characters who didn't whine had the fewest lines to say and were just ""there"" like background characters.  They had an ""introduction"" story on each of the characters, but two of the male characters (the architect and the Russian) just got dropped out of the storyline and it looked like they were just there because of how good looking they were - nothing else.

Also, in the beginning of the movie there was a lot of emphasis regarding mechanical problems during the trip that could have been disastrous, and then all of a sudden, the problems were no longer discussed - like they never happened.

I watched the movie once and then put it in my next Yard Sale.  Just not worth it.",1258243200,,1141,4.421052631578948
7896274,4,6305844372,"Very upbeat movie in the end. A minor nit, with Christine Elise- her hubby to be dies and she cries... with no visible tears. I think the lady who drowned her kids in the lake in a car and went on tv to plead for their return did that (cried with no tears thereby prompting police suspicion?).
But I digress. It was very obviously a TV movie with edits for commercial breaks. I even vaguely remember seeing part of it. There was a bit of a spiritual theme. On the way, they're off-course and all the systems  mysteriously fail and just as mysteriously come back up and course-corrects. The Commander hallucinates his ex, leading to the caves. Which ultimately lead to them being able to return home (due to his death, reducing their energy/fuel needs) and a reason to come back (minerals and water to sustain a colony). Bible gets ""quoted"" a bit, but maybe a Romans 8:28 would apply to all the events working out in the end.

No monsters, no aliens. Their only enemy is the nature of the mission. Oh and the corporation sponsering it.",1200268800,,1034,4.49468085106383
7896275,2,6305844372,"Was this a major release?  God, I hope not.  They couldn't have spent much money on this film.  It seemed flat and uninspired.  The script and the acting was second rate.  At no point was this film remotely believable.  I watched it on TV for free when nothing else was on.  That would be the only way to watch it!",1021852800,2,314,4.133333333333334
7896276,4,6305844372,"Well,overall,the movie was pretty predictable and a bit stale but a couple of the actors really made the film worthwhile. Michael Shanks,better known for his role as Daniel Jackson in the hit tv series ""Stargate SG-1"",does an excellent job portraying Bill Malone,architect and scientist. His charisma lights up the screen yet again. Some of the other actors can be a bit dopey or sappy but it's an interesting concept for a movie and is just a good watch. Hey,it's not winning an award for best movie of the year or anything but it's still something worthwhile to watch!",993340800,9,570,4.826530612244898
