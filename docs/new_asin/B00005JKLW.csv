1441302,2,B00005JKLW,"What was WRONG with Martin Lawrence when he agreed to do this mess? Essentially, this is a low-grade millennium version of the 1931 Will Rogers satire ""A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court"", which itself was based on Mark Twain's novel. Will Roger's original film about a modern man who dreams he is transported to the middle ages was bad, but this is even WORSE! Bad acting, corny story, gross-out humor, ad nauseum. However, the scene with Martin teaching the medieval musicians to play Sly Stone's ""Dance to the Music"" is mildly amusing, as his outrageous speech to rally the peasants against the King (a wild mixture of Al Sharpton, Rodney King, and John F. Kennedy), and Marsha Thompson as his love interest is rather easy on the eyes. These latter factors give it 2 stars instead of 1. But if you like Martin Lawrence, stick to his TV show.",1019260800,3,853,4.693333333333333
1441303,3,B00005JKLW,"This movie was very silly, but I like Martin Lawrence, so I rented it.  It's about a guy who gets zapped back in time and ends up being a knight and etc.  Like I said, it was silly, but I enjoyed it.",1019174400,,199,3.7142857142857144
1441304,5,B00005JKLW,its kool. its funny. its got martin lawrence. what else could u ask for in a movie. it also features the song dance to the music and its easilly compared to robin hood men in tights. this starts off stupid but is very funny after he gets to midevil times.,1019001600,,255,4.12
1441305,4,B00005JKLW,I thought this movie was pretty funny and Martin did a great job.  The fighting scenes and the plot was pretty stupid and unreal but hey! what does it matter for a comedy?  It could uuse less of the classical medieval times music but the others was pretty good.  I'm still wondering what the Beenie Man song is t the beginning of the movie. ...,1017878400,,344,4.2615384615384615
1441306,5,B00005JKLW,"This movie was awsome. Martin Lawrence was funny yet he displayed his great acting skills. Marsha Thomason is absolutly gorgeous...The Director couldn't have put a better team together in this movie. The movie is a comedy but the action and plot of this film has everything, From Romance,and tradgedy to Suspence, and Action this film has it all. I myself as well as the people in the movie theatre would all recommend this movie to you, the reader.",1017532800,,449,4.769230769230769
1441307,2,B00005JKLW,Martin Lawrence consitantly overplayed his charactor. I think Matt Lawrence would have been a better choice for this role. They could have called it the mtv generation get's knighted,1009497600,3,182,5.310344827586207
1441308,5,B00005JKLW,"this moviewas pretty funny.  when i seen the trailors i never even looked or thought twice about seein it.  i thought it was goin to be stupid.  i went to the show with my baby's moma and this was all they had showin at the time that i haven't already seen.  so we went to see it.  it started off pretty boring, but it picked up steam.  sometimes martin tries to hard.  its when hes not tryin when hes funny.  just like any comedian if u try to hard it will not be funny.  it was pretty believable how the story flows.  he actually doesnt know he is in midevil times.  it would be stupid if he were and he knew it.  it wouldnt be unbelievable.  anyway this movie was pretty entertaining, and it had a moral.  go see it it will make you laugh and entertain you.",1008720000,,760,4.047297297297297
1441309,5,B00005JKLW,"This film made me laugh from beginning to end. It's a delight to see Martin's rendition of ""A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"".  Twain would be proud.  Some may see this is just another movie about a hip, black comedian changing the lives of uptight crackers.  It IS that but a whole lot more.  The jokes are refreshingly funny and the social commentary is written into the script extremely well. I think I'll have to see it again just to catch all the quick quips Martin Dishes out as well as all the funny things that happen in the background.",1007683200,,554,4.455445544554456
1441310,5,B00005JKLW,"(...) This was seriously the worst movie of the month. But you know what! I loved it. Because it was too stupid to be stupid, too bad to be bad. Martin Lawrence did a terrific job. The plot involves one revolting group fighting against the ruling King who was trying to bond with another Lord by marriage to fight in return. The ""brave"" and ""unconventional"" knight from an outerworld, the Black Knight, Martin Lawrence, comes in, helps the revolting people and breaks the marriage. The jokes as you can imagine were all about ancient people dancing hip-hop, and swordsman fighting on battlefield with football skills. Don't see the movie if you are a serious person, it's really just all total BS.",1007164800,7,697,4.768595041322314
1441311,1,B00005JKLW,"I can't imagine Martin is hard-up for work, but to appear in such a terribly written piece of garbage as this seems to point in that direction.  Martin holds his own and is funny while this terrible plot and rotten story unfolds.  Don't go if you have anything else to do cause you'll be leaving the theater early to get started doing somthing worth while.",1007078400,7,356,4.461538461538462

1441586,4,B00005JKLW,"A guy by the name of Walker (Martin Lawrence) is cleaning up at a midevil-theme amusement park when he falls into the moat and is transported back to 1328 and/or what appears to be a Ren Fest.  He passes himself off as a messenger and gets himself introduced to the Kings' Court like he would be introduced at the Staples Center as 'Sky' Walker.  So, that is what they call him.  Funny to hear repeatedly.  Turns out there is a plan afoot to topple the king. He also claims to be a jester, a musical number follows.

After a while you can tell Lawrence carries the film on his own, occasional funny mentions (the end of the world is eight miles from here). He misuses people's quotes.  Occasional insight intyo the human condition.

In the end we wonder if it is all a dream, it sets up for a sequel.

1441670,5,B00005JKLW,This is one of the more offbeat movies that Martin Lawrence has starred in. He's a 20th century black man transported back to medieval England and the hilarity starts. He even teaches WWE wrestling moves to the natives when they rebel against the king.,1297641600,4,252,4.75

1441672,2,B00005JKLW,"Martin Lawrance certainly is more respectable compared to Anthony Anderson and Mike Epps, and yet he has a film resum that totally infuriates me.  ""Big Momma's House"", ""Rebound"", and arguably ""Bad Boys II"" (one of my most loathed cop comedies), many of his films are certainly on the bottom list; and to think I used to like ""Blue Streak"".  He may have been sorta hilarious during his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-So-Crazy/dp/B000056WR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You So Crazy</a>&nbsp;days, but much like Eddie Murphy, his recent movie material didn't work out for him.

""Black Knight"" has enough flawed elements to give it a good bashing.  It had an incredibly lazy set-up: Jamal ""Sky"" Walker (Lawrence) finds an amulet in a lake, which transports him to the middle ages.  He's surrounded by cheap sets, amateur costumes, plastic swords, and historic people who act like they're in a medieval high school play.  Sky Walker (clever, FOX) spends most of his time playing stand-up, making the usual Ebonic linguistics which are completely foreign to the babbled crowd of the early era, even making references to people they wouldn't know until long after they're dead.  Sky Walker attempt to destroy the fabrics of history by making a stupid dance sequence, which is choreography by no-longer-""American Idol""-judge Paula Abdul, establish a fast food service, and teach people boxing.  Finally, the lead meets the inevitable (anachronistic) Nubian love interest, whom he'll meet her present-day self once the film's over; jeez, I haven't seen that twist since ""Susie Q"".

And yet after all that, I don't have the burning hatred within me to crush it.  That doesn't mean I love ""Black Knight""...I just don't care.  This is paperweight material, something to crumble and throw in the trash.  The most doesn't try too much to insult, Tom Wilkinson was alright in the film, and I did chuckle on the 'we have fire' scene.  Fans of Martin Lawrence might enjoy it, but here's the thing about that statement: I'm not a fan of Chris Rock, and I enjoyed ""Head of State"" a bit more; it could be because that movie's sets didn't look like they were taken from a dollar store.",1279065600,,2211,5.194366197183099

The Middle Ages will never be the same after Jamal uses his 21st century street smarts and attitude to help a down-and-out knight and a beautiful woman defeat an evil king. Black Knight is extremely funny but slow on the on plot and not as much action as I thought. Martin Lawerence wasn't his best but he brought the laughs.",1262736000,6,610,4.710280373831775

1441730,3,B00005JKLW,"The one thing that makes time travel movies so fascinating is how they show the cultural differences between the time traveler and the era traveled to. Throwing a Nike-wearing urbanite into medieval times might sound a bit out of place, but you do get some fun scenes. Unfortunately if it's not done the right way and the scenes that are supposed to be funny get tiresome. That is what this movie suffers from more than anything else.

Okay. You can't really expect much from a time traveling movie with Martin Lawrence in it. A Martin Lawrence comedy, no matter what genre they make it, is going to be pretty much the same. Black Knight does have some good qualities to it, but they get drowned out by... well... Martin Lawrence doing what he does in just about every comedy he's made. In other words it's funny the first few times, but how many times can you see this guy freak out over some predicament? It gets old really fast. The worst part about it is the other parts of the movie actually get interesting and you can see a lot of potential here, but then Martin starts up with his usual shtick and ruins the moment. Martin really needed to branch this character out more.

As far as making everything look and feel like a real 13th century kingdom they did a pretty decent job of it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it rivals the authenticity of movies like Dragonslayer or Lord of the Rings, but I would call it a good shot for a movie with a modest budget. That is until you start getting the music in. These people need to do their research on those long trumpets because they certainly didn't sound right. Also there is a scene where Martin Lawrence gets the local minstrels to play some Motown which ended up being not only unbelievable but just plain silly (and not in a good way). Yeah I know... Martin Lawrence and all that.

To be fair the plot and back-stories were solid. There were a couple of bumps here and there, but good enough nonetheless. I really did like how the whole movie came together in the end. You also get some good performances from Kevin Conway and Vincent Regan. Marsha Thomason does surprisingly well in spite of looking out of place in medieval England. Her performance definitely makes up for that. Martin is Martin so I can't say he really made a stretch in his performance.

Black Knight is mostly just for people who like the comedy style of Martin Lawrence. If his style gets on your nerves then you might want to shy away from this one. Still it's an okay movie if you can get past Lawrence's annoying recurring fish-out-of-water theme. Just don't expect Braveheart.",1204070400,5,2612,4.4926315789473685

1441732,3,B00005JKLW,"Leave your thinking cap off and you'll enjoy this movie. Pure amusement. Martin Lawrence plays an assertive theme park worker with no pride or dedication toward his job, lots of self-respect but little to share in favor of others. With the advertising of a competitive park opening close by in the future, he advises the park owner who also happens to be his mentor, to divest herself of the park and retire. Annoyed, she sends him to clean the moat and he's on his way while telling his coworkers to file their job applications at the new theme park to beat the rush. Dredging the moat, he spies a gold medallion on a heavy gold chain sparkling through the debris-strewn water. He sticks his hand in to retrieve it and gets sucked into the filthy water and time travels back to the 14th century.

So begins Lawrence's journey into medieval England. Foisting himself off as the messenger from Normandy bringing news of the arrival of the Duke to wed the virgin daughter of the mean, usurping King Leo, he falls for one of the chambermaids (Marsha Thomason), who happens to be leading the rebellion against the king to reinstall the ousted queen. The supporting cast makes this movie -- from the drunken, fallen knight, Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson) to Princess Regina (Jeannette Wegger), King Leo's not so virginal daughter.

Some critics have poopahed Lawrence's acting abilities, but when I watch him interviewed in person and then watch his movies, I can only draw the conclusion that his acting abilities are top notch. One would almost think that the offscreen Lawrence is his major acting role, compared to the ones he portrays. Offscreen he appears intellectual, quiet mannered, almost shy. Who can say that about his performances on screen? While Black Knight won't win any awards, it's still very entertaining and to repeat, the supporting cast is terrific.",1152576000,,1863,4.873817034700315

1441734,3,B00005JKLW,"I was afraid of this movie. I was truly frightened out of my boots. You know why? Because of the premise. Imagine the premise of a modern day man in medieval times. How would that work? I already fear the possibility of a corny incident and I was not let down. You know how the main character got into medieval times? Through a magical necklace. Wow, huh?

Yup, people, that is the beginning of the movie. The movie stars Martin Lawrence as a man named Jamal. He works at this place called ""Medieval World"" and they are about to receive competition in the form of ""CastleWorld"". Jamal doesn't really care and believes the boss should just cash out, but his boss doesn't feel the same. She is disappointed, but Jamal doesn't care. Later on, as he is cleaning, he saw a strange necklace in the moat and as he tried to get it, it sucked him in. That begins our magical adventure and it is quite possibly the corniest modern day beginning ever. That can fly with the Wizard of Oz because it is a classic and it was made long ago, but that plot doesn't fly today. As a matter of fact, I may have disgraced the name of ""The Wizard of Oz"" by mentioning it in the same sentence as Black Knight.

Anyway, after being sucked in, our hero finds himself in medieval times. The movie wasted no time in teaching me that medieval citizens of England spoke modern English quite well by showing Jamal speaking with a citizen perfectly. The guy also ends up dying, but he then wakes up a moment later, and keep in mind that Jamal just finished making a whole scene about the guy not breathing. Later on, he travels around and finally arrives in a village. There, he sees as castle and believes it is the new amusement park, ""CastleWorld"". Jamal is quite perceptive, isn't he? If I had landed in a place where there is no city or road around, but only a bunch of people dressed in rags, I would guess it is an amusement park too. So after arriving at the castle and informing the guards that he is from Florence and Normandie (which they mistake for Normandy), he is let in. Thus Jamal's adventure begins and we will be introduced to medieval times at the highest possible accuracy, such as how politically correct people were in those times.

Seriously, though, this movie simply has way too many flaws, even for a Martin Lawrence movie. I am watching this after Lawrence's other movie ""Nothing To Lose"" and I am finding that this movie is actually worse than the other. Unlike other comedies based in medieval times, this movie lacks comedy. Other movies do it by an almost extreme form of exaggeration, but this movie seems like it's aiming for some sort of moderate accuracy, which it fails in every way. If you had ever read a book based in medieval times by an accredited author, then be prepared to shake your head at this movie on every turn. You don't believe me? At many points in this movie, the seventh chambermaid of the king (Victoria) speaks in a way resembling a ""feminist"". Can you possibly imagine a feminist in that kind of setting? If you can, you're an idiot.

Anyway, needless to say, one of the main problem of a movie like this is inaccuracy. With the feminist scene mentioned above, one of the girls with Victoria asked if she is infected with the plague (i.e. bubonic plague), but the plague did not appear in Europe until 1347, yet Victoria will say later on that the date is 1328. Now you're probably thinking that I'm too nitpicky, but it happens ALL the time in this movie. Hell, you don't even need to know about the medieval age to tell when something inaccurate pops up. It also doesn't help when Martin Lawrence flashes his ass at me in some kind of strange position in preparation for sex. I can tolerate Tom Hanks' ass, I can tolerate Keanu Revees' ass (if you watched the Matrix, you probably tolerated it too), and I can tolerate Leo DiCaprio's ass, but I would rather be pleased NOT to see Lawrence's ass.

Returning back to the several anachronisms, Jamal also somehow managed to get new modern clothing (I'm not sure how) and he also attempted to introduced a fast food center. The problem with this is that there are no machinations designed to make fast food in the medieval period, so how did his design work internally? Didn't Jamal go to a place called school? Why in the blue hell did he think he could introduce a fast food place there?

Moving away from this kind of problems, we come to a new set of problems. What is wrong is that the laughs come rarely, if ever at all. For me, it came sometimes, but not often enough for my taste. What is wrong is that the movie tries to play off situational comedy and it fails miserably. The situational comedy consists of the usual, people being kicked around, Jamal introducing modern culture to the king, him also making a complete ass of himself, etc etc. One of these situations includes him trying to pass himself off as a sorcerer by showing everyone fire through a lighter. For some reason, Jamal thought fire wasn't around despite him being in rooms where there were fireplaces and, for some reason, no one seemed to think it was strange that Jamal was using a modern day lighter. Right after this, they show a scene where the executioner is choking on an apple. Apparently, no one ever saw another person choking before because they all thought Jamal casted a spell on him. Yeah, ha ha.

Anyway, it seems like this movie tries to play too much off the situational comedy and it lacks intelligent comedy. As much as I like laughing at the stupidity of some guy, I would prefer it if all the comedy was based solely on his stupidity because it's simply too unrealistic. When you're not asking yourself ""what"", ""how"", or ""why"", you'll find yourself hoping for something to make you laugh. When that something does appear (if it does at all), then you'll find yourself treasuring it as if it was your last.",1105142400,,5882,4.50187265917603
1441735,1,B00005JKLW,"I cannot stress the fact that this film has been overplayed and recycled through Hollywood more times that I can count.  While I have read some reviews that claim that this is one of Lawrence's more creative roles yet, I can only laugh and gag simultaneously at these words.  Lawrence was a major contributor to the downfall of this film.  He provided no character analysis, no development, and definitely no humor to the entire story.  It was as if we were watching a dress rehearsal in progress before the final script arrived with all of Lawrence's funny bits.  From the quick introduction at the beginning of the film (a mere 7 minutes of character introduction), until the incoherent ending that was trying to monopolize on the popularity of Gladiator, we never see Lawrence's character of ""Jamal"" or ""Skywalker"" (depending on the care of the actors) emerge from the film.  This was merely Martin Lawrence cashing in on his already overplayed self, stretching no further than his comfortable limits and never exerting anything ""fresh"".  He has fallen into the cracks of the Hollywood recycling bin and Black Knight reinforces that idea.

Sadly, Lawrence isn't backed up with any better acting or story.  Tom Wilkinson has done some amazing films during his career, but apparently was looking to buy a new car with this film.  It required no ""real"" acting from him, just sloppy drunkenness with cliched moments near the end that could have been pulled from any other film like this one.  I think that was my major problem with this film (beside the lackluster Lawrence) was the story.  There wasn't any.  It felt like we were forced from the beginning to all of our different places and events just to fill time.  There wasn't any redeeming value from the story.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that whomever wrote this screenplay may have...gasp...plagiarized from nearly every other film like this one out there.  The structure was nothing new, the formula literally had dust on it, and nobody seemed to care.  Lawrence obviously didn't from the performance that he gave, but I expected more from Mr. Wilkinson who has impressed me in the past.  This was not the best showcase for his talent, or for anyone's talent to say the least.  We must always remember that it begins with a story, and if it doesn't sound good on paper than it isn't going to translate well onto the screen.  This is a rule to live by for everyone involved with the Black Knight debacle.

Finally, I normally don't mention this in my reviews, but with this film it just stood out more than any other that I have seen, but the production of this film was horrible.  The costumes, the sets, and even the way the shots were framed seemed ""cheap"" in so many ways.  The costumes are the first that come to mind because Lawrence always seemed like he was wearing something that was made with haste.  How could he have quickly made this garment in the time that he was in this land?  Who knows, but it was ""cheap"" and only lowered this film further into the muck pit.  If the story is going to be bad, and the actors are not going to give their full potential by actually doing what they are paid ... to be creative ... than at least give us something to look at Production Team!  Unfortunately, there was nothing ravishing to even glance at.  The entire Medieval World that Lawrence works at from the beginning is ""cheap"" and obviously a set.  I want a film to take me away from Hollywood and give me my dollar's worth, not rob me blind.  The cinematography was done by a two-year old.  Nothing spectacular, nothing worth writing about.

Overall, this was a very poor film.  Would it have hurt anyone working on this project to use a little something I like to call ""imagination""?  Creativity was not being used or welcomed in this film.  You could tell that the director wanted to make the film, edit out what didn't work, finish, and relax at home while thinking of all the different ways that he could spend his Hollywood money!  I blame two major players in this film for the overall poor quality.  The first is Mr. Lawrence.  If he does not expand his acting potential and bring something new to the screen, I don't think his Hollywood stay will be very long.  The second player that I blame for this befuddling mess is the writer.  Again, creativity and imagination went backseat to the infamous Hollywood recycling bin.  This was a truly disappointing picture.

I still really like Martin Lawrence, he's still a favorite, but boy was this movie a mess.  Martin Lawrence plays a goofy (and goof-off) employee for a Renaissance Fair-like amusement park in southern California named Jamal, who dreams of a better life when a competing attraction called Castle World prepares to open down the road.  As he contemplates this possible new job, Jamal spies a glowing medallion necklace in the fake moat at work, and in reaching for it accidentally falls in ...
When he comes out again, he's been tranported to the late 14th century, is promptly mistaken for a messenger from the Duke of Normandie, and becomes the jester -- then head of security -- while all the time plotting to get into the dress of a beautiful servant girl, whom he learns is part of a rebellion to overthrow the evil king and put the rightful queen back onto the throne.
When Jamal comes out of the water in the 14th-century, in jeans and a football jersey and sneakers that no one questions, I knew the script suffered from lack of common sense.  Martin, good as he is, can't overcome the bad writing of a film that just never crosses the line to be believable.  His clothes, style of talk, and slanguage fit right in from the beginning, and the silly sitcom-style circumstances that lead to his being made head of the king's security will just make you roll your eyes, and the cast surrounding Martin Lawrence are adequate -- but still can't make up for a script that just isn't funny.

The premise that an English king can mistake Lawrence for a Moorish messenger from Normandy is hilarious in and of itself. From then on the laughs continue. Martin Lawrence is constantly in movement: he runs, he dances, he fights, he falls down, he accidentally ends up in bed with a king's daughter. All of this adds up to a nice fast-paced comedy.
The movie is very entertaining. Neither the main hero, nor the main villain can be taken completely seriously, and that what makes it a light, hilarious adventure, which is nevertheless not devoid of a moral lesson.

The characters seem to just be going through the motions and Martin looks as though he's just doing it for the paycheck.
Feature aside, the DVD is chock-full of special features and tons of extras. It actually makes the movie better than it is. You can tell the director really wanted to give fans of the film more bang for their buck. The DVD has wonderful color, sharp visuals, crisp resolution and dynamic dobly digital sound. The special features are great. You get two featurettes, behind the scenes commentary from Martin Lawrence and the director himself. Plus, you get to hear testimonials from Martin and the cast about each other.  The deleted scenes also give you more insight into the characters and their roles in the film.

The premise is interesting, and I agree that ""Black Knight"" is not as bad as you might think.  However, the fact is, Martin Lawrence did better films like ""Bad Boys"" ""Nothing to Lose,"" and ""Blue Streak,"" all of which I enjoyed.  And all of them have able players as his sidekicks --
Will, Tim, and Luke, respectively -- but in ""Black Knight"" he chose to go alone almost through the whole movie though Tom Wilkinson (""Full Monty"") gives a few precious help (but rather in a too serious mood) as a drunken knight.
As a result, the camera, intentionally or not, shows constantly Lawrence's mugging; in itself it is all right, especially when he has a partner by his side, but in this case I soon found that he does it too much.  I can understand how his fans love what he does; but it is hardly possible for the film to convert anyone who sees him for the first time, to one of them; ""Blue Streak"" and ""Big Mama's House"" would have a better chance.
Sometimes the film is really funny, and it is when Jamal teaches the musicians at the court how to play the funky music of Sly and the Family Stone's number, ""Dance to the Music.""  As far as this scene goes, ""Black Knight"" should be called funny.  But it just doesn't last long.",1037923200,,1740,4.429467084639499
1441843,1,B00005JKLW,"Jamal (Martin Lawrence) works at a small Medieval amusement park and he could care less whether the amusement park lasts or perishes from competition.  One day he ends up finding a medallion in the bottom of the moat while cleaning it.  When Jamal grabs the medallion he is sucked into a time warp and ends up in the English 12th century where brute knights and beautiful maidens live in filth and tyranny.  Jamal adjusts quickly to the new environment and he even gets his own line of designer clothes.  Martin Lawrence is hilarious at times, however, the big picture is a rather terrible film experience.",1031875200,3,606,4.742857142857143
1441844,2,B00005JKLW,"I'm not a huge fan of Martin Lawrence but I had seen the preview for the movie and thought it might be worth a laugh (besides...I had a free rental!).  I have to admit that the first time I watched it, I didn't find it funny.  However, I ended up watching it again with a friend and was mildly surprised the second time around.
It certainly isn't Martin Lawrence at his best.  Tom Wilkinson as Knolte was disappointing...not for his portrayal but the fact that he chose to be in a movie like this.  The best part of the movie for me was Percival, played by Vincent Regan.  An almost unknown actor here in North America, this was certainly not the greatest bit of acting he's done.  For a sample of what he can really do, check out his performance as Buck in The Messenger: Joan of Arc by Luc Besson. (Whatever you do, don't rent the poorly done Point Men).
This is one of those movies that, if you don't take it too seriously (and you're not supposed to), you might enjoy it!",1029542400,,975,4.271739130434782
1441845,3,B00005JKLW,"This film is a typical shallow-plotted movie with a flare for comedy & a twist of adventure.  If you watch this film with no expectations at all, chances are, you will enjoy it.  I suggest that viewers should have no preconceived idea against any of the actors, especially that of the lead role.  True, this film is no brainer, but if you give it a chance, you will find yourself laughing at some silly (& yes, stupid!)scenes.  However, if you watch this film with a preset mind (e.g. it's lousy, yes I agree), you will definitely end up getting annoyed.  More so, if you expect some serious stuff, you will definitely find this a waste of time.
So I suggest that you loosen up a bit, watch this film when you're in a good mood (ok, maybe even when you're not in perfect condition)& simply enjoy the company.
Word of advice:  Don't buy. Just rent.",1027382400,,847,4.432258064516129
1441896,1,B00005JKLW,"One word: pathetic. I could have pulled something better than this from my arse. It's scary to even think that there are probably a lot of people that liked this piece of merde. Big film companies should know better, they should conserve their money for the better films like Black Hawk Down or the Silence of the Lambs. Films like this are becoming more common these days and it makes you wonder ""What the hell were they thinking!?"" (I don't actually know the answer to that question...sorry) Martin Lawrence used to be funny, but then he did Blue Streak and it all went downhill from there. If you liked this turd, you'll enjoy stuff like The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Piranha 2.",1025481600,4,684,4.569105691056911
1441897,3,B00005JKLW,"When the castle where Jamal works is threatened by competition, Jamal tells his boss, who owns the castle, to ""take your money and run."" He doesn't care about his job or about the possibility of the castle closing. His stern female boss, after giving orders as to what Jamal needs to clean next, expresses disappointment that Jamal doesn't ""get it."" She wants to stay in business and have something good to offer to the public. Jamal and his pal talk about applying for a job at the competition while working: While Jamal is trying to reach a necklace in the moat, he falls in and appears in medieval times. He sees ""the castle"" and believes it is the new competition so it takes awhile before he realizes where (and when) he is.
Yes, this movie is predictible, and more could have been done to illustrate Jamal's growth (and purpose) in the movie, but it's not all bad. There are funny moments in it, and the supporting cast manages to evoke feelings of ""rooting for"" the good to win out over the evil. Jamal has some interesting challenges to
work his way through, and the more he decides to stay and help fight a battle that is not his (parallel the castle job and the possibility of its closing not being his battle to fight to save it, either), the more interesting his character becomes. I think the purpose of Jamal's being transported in time is to help change him so that he does ""get it"" and can help his boss continue to stay in business and offer something worthwhile to the public.",1025049600,,1494,4.4963235294117645
1441898,1,B00005JKLW,"One of the worst ""movies"" I've ever seen. All there is to see and hear is inner city slangs, bring downs, jokes and talk ... ""white people"" this ... ""White girl"" that ... ""AWRIGT!"" ... ""I got ya back"" ... ""You know what I mean"". If I had to watch the movie all over again and count who many times those phrases are repeated I'd throw myself into a horse's behind 1st. Dialog consist of Lawrence's ""improv"" & aledgedly funny facial expressions throughout the WHOLE movie. Script is simply HORRIBLE. Set is HORRIBLE. Cast is HORRIBLE. Don't waste your money on this HORRIBLE movie.",1023494400,6,579,4.576923076923077
1441899,1,B00005JKLW,"Movie Review - I have never seen a movie this bad. The movie is about a ""street smart"" guy called Sly (Martin Lawrence) who was transported back in medieval time, and got caught up with a group of rebellion trying to restore their queen to the throne. This plot has the potential of becoming a great and funny movie, but somehow it failed miserably. The script is so bad that I groaned consistantly throughout the movie. The development of the main character is not convincing enough and has little depth, even Shrek has more depth than this. And the badly acted ""street smart"" attitude (e.g. yo king chill dude, wassup homie etc) start to get on my nerves about half way through the movie. The supporting actors looks like amateurs or B (maybe even C) class actors, especially the king, his right-hand-man, and the drunken knight (who looked like he's trying to act drunk but couldn't quite pull it off). The costume and medieval settings are so-so, there are many films out there with better and more realistic settings that this one.
DVD Review - The picture quality is good; sharp, crisp and has little grain effect. The sound is also good. The bonus materials are plentiful, which is always a good thing. However, since the movie is so bad, it puts me off watching the bonus materials altogether.
Conclusion -  A horrible film that makes you groan throughout the film. The DVD is feature packed, it couldn't make up for a bad movie. I suggest you borrow or rent if you feel that you still need to see this movie. Try watching Blue Streak (for Martin Lawrence) or A Knight's Tale (for medieval theme) for a MUCH more enjoyable movie experience.",1021939200,3,1648,4.6438356164383565
1441900,1,B00005JKLW,"I gave this film one star because it was in color!! Aside from this fact, the thought behind the story seemed to have merit. I guess I was hoping for a lot more of ""A Yankee In King Arthur's Court"" than I got. Horrible, predictable script, stupid presumptions, adolescent attempts at baseline humor.
This is no ""Big Momma's House"" by even the most liberal of standards. Hated it.",1021075200,2,379,4.588235294117647
1441901,3,B00005JKLW,"I saw this film when it was released in theaters.  I now own it on DVD.  Why?  Well, it grew on me.  It's not that funny, but, it's still an entertaining film nonetheless.  Plus, Martin Lawrence plays a different character for a change.  The last time I saw him play someone outside of a cop or con-man/crook was A THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE (the best of Lawrence's films as far as I'm concerned).  I won't bother giving details about the plot of Black Knight for other reviewers have done so already.  The film does have a sense of morality to it as well as a little action and sword-fighting.  I actually like the fight sequence especially when Martin does a little sword-fighting himself.  Anyway, if you're looking for an entertaining film, give this one a try.  You'll be satisfied.",1019520000,,792,4.546099290780142
1441902,3,B00005JKLW,"Martin Lawrence stars in this comedy, as ""Jamal"".  Jamal works for a medieval times amusement center, and takes a trip back to the true ""medieval times"" when he falls into the moat he is cleaning out.
His character seems totally selfish in the beginning, but changes for the better by the end of the movie.  You could say there is a moral to the story.  Do unto others...
I am not a big fan of Lawrence. My husband rented this.  Well, I actually liked it to some extent.  While it wasn't completely original with it's hip modern music thrown in...and time travel,... it as least has a bit of a twist to it.
Instead of just playing Sly and the Family Stone's ""Dance to the Music"" and having the townsfolk dance around, Jamal teaches the musicians to play and sing to something hip enough for him to dance to.  This was my favorite part of the movie.  It was just a lot of fun to watch, and Lawrence was genuinely funny here.
As far as the time travel part goes, he doesn't deliberately go back in time. At first, he thinks he is in the new competition for where he works, until the fair chambermaid, Victoria, tells him what year it really is.
This wasn't a waste of time by any means. It was good for some light comedic entertainment.  To the big fans of Martin Lawrence, you will totally enjoy!",1019520000,,1295,4.344398340248962

1441904,4,B00005JKLW,"Unbelievable what I read in these reviews.  People that went to see Martin and apparently wanted Marlon Brando. You want the Godfather pick Marlon, you want laughter pick Martin!! Martins acting has definetly improved over the years.  I.E. Big Momma (which can definetly be compared to Eddie Murphy's Nutty Professor), if you found nothing funny there u must be dead! This is not a documentary it is a comedy and if you want to laugh GO SEE BLACK KNIGHT.  Oh, and lets not forget little Mrs. Thomason OHH LA LA, thats all I can/should have to say. :o) This film is good warm comedy not intellectual comedy, it's the kind of comedy you sit back eat popcorn and giggle sometimes and laugh out loud other times.  If you don't believe me ask people as they exit the theatre 5 out of 4 had a good laugh and thats what your there for right??

1441905,3,B00005JKLW,"This was a fun film. It is basically the old ""Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court"" story that we have seen so many times, but Martin Lawerence adds a freshness to it and he is enjoyable to watch as usual. I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that it is 4th grade humor. I didn't think so and I am way past 4th grade and have been to college. This would be a great family movie except for the many instances of vulgarity, and the thing is that Lawrence is charismatic and funny enough that he dosent need to resort to the vulgarity to be funny. Oh well. At any rate, this was a pleasant time killer.",1019347200,,612,4.151260504201681
