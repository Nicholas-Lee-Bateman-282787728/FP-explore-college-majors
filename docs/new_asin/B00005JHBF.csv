7938736,2,B00005JHBF,"While this isn't the last or even the worst time something from Japan was imported -- kinda -- to the US (remember the Fox atrocity of 2003 ""Bonzai?""), it's arguably the least entertaining show ever to be broadcast on network television.  And that's saying something.
For someone who wants a flashback to roughly 1980, go for it, just for the hairstyles and costumes alone  (mmmm....brown sequined catsuits.....).
Of course, it would help if the stars (Japenese singing duo ""Pink Lady"") could speak English.  There have been accusations that they could -- though not fluently -- but there's no evidence of it in this program.  All of their dialogue was obviously learned by rote -- parrot fashion.  This is especially obvious when they lip-synch their musical numbers.  The mouth movements sometimes have nothing to do with the sounds allegedly come out of their mouths.
Then, let's talk about the humor.  Comedian (though you couldn't prove it in this program) Jeff Altman is given some of the most unfunny lines to say.  ""You just like my sexy round eyes....""?
And the ""comedy"" sketches....oy!  It's about as funny as being disemboweled with a rusty spatula.  How Jim Varney (from the Earnest... movies) was able to keep this from completely destrying his career is one of the great unknowns of the universe.
The reason I give this more than a single star is simply due to the historical importance of the.  The fact is that the TV networks had a lot more power back then -- similar to the old studio system in Hollywood.  The fact that they could get such capable guest stars as Bert Parks attests to this.  The fact that NBC thought they could get anyone to watch this is a sign that such a system was on its way out.",1066089600,,1721,4.696666666666666
7938737,5,B00005JHBF,"Here's your opportunity to enjoy one of NBC's most notorious flops from the ""Proud as a Peacock"" era.  Rhino Home Video has preserved ""Pink Lady and Jeff"" beginning with this Volume One release of the show's premiere episode.
Guest Stars on this first show include Sherman Hemsley from ""The Jeffersons"" and Bert Parks who had then recently been dropped from hosting the Miss America pageant.  Blondie is also listed as a Guest Star, however the band's appearance is actually simply a video from the ""Eat to the Beat"" release.
The video is released by Rhino Home Video and is of excellent quality with regard to picture and sound.  I think there may be a total of six episodes for the entire run of ""Pink Lady and Jeff"" from the spring of 1980.  Rhino currently has offered two volumes each containing one episode.
The ""Pink Lady and Jeff"" show ranks high among Fred Silverman's dubious credits during his tenure as NBC president in the late '70s and is certainly something I never thought we'd see released on video.  Now if only ""Supertrain"" was available on video!",994291200,,1066,4.7405405405405405
