8058810,5,B0009A40LG,Both The Lost Ships of the Mediterranean and the Shipwreck Hunters were excellent shows.  National Geographic at their best.,1416096000,,124,5.526315789473684
8058811,5,B0009A40LG,"The first program involves a 1999 search for two Phoenician vessels in deep water opposite Ashkelon, Israel, which had been observed and reported to Ballard 2 years earlier by the crew of the NR-1 US Navy sub.

The second 22 min. program involves a 1999 expedition dive on a Greek vessel off Tektas Burun, Turkey led by George Bass.  (He is also featured in the Nova program Ancient Treasures Of The Deep which covers an earlier dive off Turkey.)",1371772800,,446,4.632911392405063

8058813,2,B0009A40LG,"I think the cover is somewhat misleading:  this is not what I thought it was.

WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS:  a survey of famous ship wrecks that occurred in the Mediterranean.  The story behind them, how they sank, what was in them, and recent attempts to recover their booty.

WHAT IT TURNED OUT TO BE:  It's basically about one shipwreck, an old Phoenician trader that sank about the time Homer was writing.  At first they're not sure how old it is, but they send down a sub and Lord!  Turns out it's old.

Interesting as far as it went, but the high-tech geekiness was definitely at odds with the romantic, piratey mood conveyed by the cover.",1277337600,3,639,4.439655172413793
8058814,3,B0009A40LG,"The special feature segment is just as important as the main show.  One covers shipwrecks deep in the sea.  One covers one near the coast.  One has ancient items intact.  One has broken items.

The narrator says, ""This underwater robot, Jason, was used to explore the Titanic.""  In the 1996 film ""Titanic,"" that machine was called ""Snoop Dog.""  I couldn't help but laugh.  I guess ""Snoop Dog"" is sexier than ""Jason"" for Hollywood purposes.  The rapper should be proud of himself.

It's sad that tragedies help us learn about the past.  I love the pots, but I felt terribly knowing a shipload of people died shipping them.  Think about Clooney's ""Perfect Storm,"" for example.  Then again, we know much about ancient animals because of tar pits or insects caught in amber.

I'm sure there's more interesting National Geographic installments out there, but this was pretty enriching to watch.",1206230400,3,889,4.918918918918919
