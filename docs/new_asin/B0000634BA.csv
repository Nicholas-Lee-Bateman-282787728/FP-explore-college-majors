7959116,5,B0000634BA,"Just as 'World At War', narrated by Larry Olivier, is the definitive video documentary on World War II, so 'The Great War', narrated by Michael Redgrave, is the definitive video documentary on World War I. Stunning in its presentation of human suffering and endurance, the viewer is taken back to a time of empires, some of which were in place for a thousand years, and shown how the entire world was changed. The viewer can't help but be catapulted 100 years into the future to the present and see how the present makeup of nations and societies were forged and created NOT by World War II, but by World War I. Several years ago, I purchased a $35 region-free dvd player so that I could view this series. Probably the best $35 I have ever spent.",1431043200,3,746,4.492647058823529

7959118,5,B0000634BA,"I own this product (though I acquired it through other means) so I can't comment on the quality of the packaging as it relates to this product as sold through Amazon.
I can fully comment on the documentary itself though. It's a well written, well thought out documentary filmed decades ago with first person accounts of the war from actual veterans and citizens who lived through it. I find that key element to be important in a war documentary, as no summary can really take the place of hearing first hand from someone who was there, what something was like. The narration was written in such a way that helps explain the way the world was just prior to the war, during the war and after. You get a clear idea of things. I really feel this is one of the better documentaries to watch. The entire documentary is in black and white, and it feels as if they had better access to achival footage than many of the other war documentaries I've seen. This is one of the best, if you're looking for a great WWI documentary to watch. I really felt like I had a better understanding of what led to the war and the war itself after watching this.",1363564800,,1137,4.367924528301887
7959119,5,B0000634BA,"If you want the best documentary on WWI, this is it, there is none better. Just make sure you understand that this series has not been released in the United States, so if you buy it, make sure you either have an all region dvd player, or a player that you can do a region unlock on. Luckily, my player allows me to unlock all regions with a simply remote code entry. Do your research and you will find helpful websites that can tell you if your player can be unlocked. If it can't, spend the money to buy one that can so you can enjoy this fantastic series.",1357948800,3,558,4.128440366972477
7959120,5,B0000634BA,"I have watched other documentaries on both World War 1 and World War 2..and I think this has to be by far the best on World War 1..and i would even say that this is as good if not better than ""World at War"" for World War 2. (""World at War was very good..but this is equally as good if not better)

17 hours long roughly and every bit of it is great.",1347580800,,349,3.780821917808219
7959121,5,B0000634BA,"The availability of this epic series produced by the BBC to be part of the 50th year remembrance of World War I, was unforgettable, which I quickly swooped on to have my own copy.  The original series played for around 26 weeks, and I remember even today sitting in front of our black and white television receiver waiting for the coming week's episode back in 1964.  The voice of Michael Redgrave and the eerie music that started each week is indelibly planted in my brain.  As Ian Jack of the Guardian wrote - each week the 'ominous music ushered the audience into the trenches'. The series was outstanding in the 1960's and the nature of its production using photographs of the time appears to me to be a pathfinder to Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" that came in the early 1990's and perfected the use of still photography into a equally brilliant series. The BBC series in the main followed the course of the war and successive episodes highlighted years of the war episodes 1-6 to 1914, 7-10 to 1915, 11-14 to 1916, 15-19 to 1917, and the concluding episodes in 1918.  The magic was further heightened by use of quotations such as ""on the idle hill of summer..."", ""we must hack our way through"" to .... ""the iron thrones are falling""  and ""...and we were young"" from famous persons of the era.

Historians will examine this cataclysmic event that truly did eventually engulf the world; that dramatically shaped the course of the 20th Century and consider its effects and causes 50 years on from this series in different ways, but the visual material that the BBC's series contains will remain fresh, interesting and challenging to all of us living in the 21st Century.

It was an epic of a series, unavailable for many years; a great find and worth every penny.",1333756800,2,1761,4.625
7959122,5,B0000634BA,I viewed this series back to back over a couple of days because it was so good.  The video quality is amazingly well preserved...not sped up like most WWI archive films seem to be...this stuff is in real motion time and it has very rare footage of Kaiser Wilhelm II and very rare footage of actual battles taking place...not reenactments. Just a wonderful series that should be converted into Region 1 for Americans but if you have a multiple region player or one that can be switched between regions like I have ...it works great.,1208995200,8,531,4.589473684210526
7959123,5,B0000634BA,"For any serious student of military history this ancient BBC series is a MUST.  It tells the epic story of the internecine tribal conflict in the Balkans and the efforts of the failing Austrian-Hungarian Empire's attempts to quell a rebellion there within its territories.  A horrified Europe watching this conflict erupt into a full-scale war on a scale unprecedented in its suffering ever known in human history.  The story is told using movie footage shot at the time alongside eyewitness statements and commentaries.  A series on this subject of this nature could not be made today simply because nearly all the participants of this terrible event are no longer with us.  We do not share their naive innocence with our benefit of hind site.  Here there is no cynicism or propaganda; just the personal experiences of our witnesses.  The is no need to slant the series into a kind of anti-war statement, each individual factual episode points out the futility of war without really meaning to.  This unfolding simple story of unflinching bravery and sacrifice for a noble cause -viewed from both sides, would surely baffle the modern viewer.  Here is depicted industrialised slaughter on an incomprehensible scale.  Does anyone care to know that that the British army suffered more casualties on the first day Battle of The Somme than the Americans suffered throughout their entire war in Vietnam?  But the scale of losses does not begin nor end here.  For year after bloody year a total war of attrition was slugged out between the Allies and The Central Powers, leaving The British Empire - alongside a growing American military presence - and Imperial Germany as the principal antagonists.  The end, when it came was sudden by the scale of previous campaigns and disappointments.  A combination of failure of political nerve and general war-weariness on the allied side, and exhaustion, starvation and revolution in Germany - and its allies, Austria/Hungary and Turkey, suffering likewise, brought about an armistice.  While ending the war it allowed Germany to escape from total defeat, paving the way for an even bloodier war a generation later.  The rest as they say, is history.",1172275200,11,2187,5.067039106145251
7959124,5,B0000634BA,"Why the other reviewer gave this 1 star (even though he wants it) is beyond me.  There is nothing else like this DVD collection: the most comporehensive collection of WWI footage anywhere, anytime.  Get it through Amazon uk and get a region free DVD player!  It is worth the investment.",1157587200,9,286,4.68
