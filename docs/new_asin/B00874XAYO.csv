5135249,5,B00874XAYO,I have arthritis.  I have always thought about doing yoga but was never interested in going to a class.  A friend gave me this DVD so i decided to try it.  IT IS PERFECT FOR ME.  I do it 3 to 4 times a week and my body is so much more agile;  My hands don't hurt near as much;  I have slimed down some and i just overall feel better about myself. This DVD stretches every inch of my body--even my eyes.  Jackie is easy to follow and the music is pleasant.  My cats enjoy hanging out with me while i excercise which i find very relaxing.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is interested in shaping up or staying in shape.  Thank You Jackie and Winnie.,1335744000,6,658,3.9923076923076923
8525949,4,B00874XAYO,"A great video but a little too slow.  Maybe when I am 90 but not right now. Senior who is still active would fall asleep.  Only negative comment:  Hate the way she shakes out her arms when you are suppose to release tension.  Take a deep breath, arms up and down.  Much better.  She looks a little silly with that shake shake.",1465430400,,326,4.17741935483871
8525950,2,B00874XAYO,"Having a chair in the room does not mean a session is chair yoga. Good beginning video, and Jackie is a great teacher, but much of the session involves standing poses with the chair left behind. I got this for someone who cannot do standing poses. It's described as being chair yoga. So, it was a waste of money. This isn't my favorite beginning regular beginning yoga video, so I wouldn't get it again.",1435881600,4,403,4.45945945945946
8525951,1,B00874XAYO,I was looking forward to this but was disappointed that most of the exercises happened while standing instead of sitting in chair which is why I was using it in the first place.,1394668800,5,177,4.393939393939394
8525952,4,B00874XAYO,I purchased this for my 92 year old mother to exercise. I have done regular and chair yoga at the Y and the DVD seemed appropriate,1390780800,,130,4.038461538461538
8525953,5,B00874XAYO,I have been attending one of Jackie's classes for four years and look forward to each session.  This video is ideal for me to take with me on trips because I just don't do as well without it. It helps me with my balance and keeps my muscles stretched.,1381536000,,251,4.122448979591836
8525954,5,B00874XAYO,"Just what I was looking for--not too difficult , not too easy.  Jackie is a great instructor who explains the positions and demonstrates them as we'll.",1380067200,2,151,4.8076923076923075
8525955,5,B00874XAYO,"Jackie starts you with an easy, reduced version of actual yoga moves, so that as you improve you will be doing the actual moves.  I find it a convenient, and non-intimidating to get more ease of movement.  I felt results after just a couple of times.",1375574400,,250,4.413043478260869
8525956,3,B00874XAYO,"If you done one you'll done them all. It wasn't anything different from the ""yoga for seniors"" that I also ordered . I could have ordered one .",1375056000,,143,4.142857142857143
8525957,4,B00874XAYO,This is my first ever experience with chair yoga. Normally I visit places where flight take 18-20 hr to destination. So found helpful to relieve stiffness resulting from sitting for long duration.,1362009600,2,196,5.15625
8525958,4,B00874XAYO,I am a Yoga Instructor and I do recommend Jackie's Chair Yoga. Jackie's chair yoga routine is excellent for beginners. Jackie's cues are clear and emphasize allignment and proper posture. Good job Jackie!,1356307200,4,204,5.212121212121212
