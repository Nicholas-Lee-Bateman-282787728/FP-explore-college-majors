8494769,4,B00004UEEL,"I gave this show a four because its length is only 39 minutes long and the first 5 to 10 minutes is made up of footage
with music and no narration. It is entertaining but not informative. The second part does give a good documentary on
this fighter jet with a lot of great current footage! At $25.00 the price is a little high for a 40 minute show but I
liked just about everything in the show. I just wished it had been a little longer with more footage on the Grippen!
Basically it left me wanting more content/footage for the price. I would still recommend this dvd because it is the
only one I have found on the Grippen and it is a good documentary overall!",1363392000,,661,4.171875
