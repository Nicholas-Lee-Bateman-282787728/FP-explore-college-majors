7671685,1,B01C3JYH4A,Very disappointed in this film. Neither suspenseful nor scary... Pretty blah. Waste of a rental.,1459728000,,96,5.466666666666667
7671686,1,B01C3JYH4A,"Two serial killers kidnap women and photograph them, leaving the pictures for a pretty small town grocery checkout girl to find.  She brings them to the police, but they do nothing to try to link the photos to missing women in the area and don't seem concerned about the potential safety of said checkout girl.  In fact, the checkout girl (unlike the police) believes that the photos are legit but there's little indication that even she's concerned about her own safety.  At one point her best friend is grabbed by the killers and our plucky checkout girl barely seems to notice or care that her friend has vanished.

To make this stupidity even worse, the serial killers are posing the dead women in ways that are inspired by the work of a specific fashion photographer (played by Kal Penn, who tries desperately to smart-ass this movie into entertainment territory with little success).  The fashion photographer is in turn inspired by the serial killers, even though he has never seen any of the dead girl photos.  The movie literally has no idea what to do with this notion about the link between the fashion photographer's work and the killers and what it means that they are inspiring each other so the film's one potential idea is never developed.

The Girl in the Photographs wastes the great Katharine Isabelle by offing her in the opening scene, but that sequence is actually suspenseful and creepy and offers false promise for the movie to come.  Unfortunately, by the movie's midpoint The Girl in the Photographs pretty much gives up completely on any attempt at generating suspense in favor of seemingly endless prattling on by its characters.

So The Girl in the Photographs isn't really about anything.  After the second thriller sequence about 30 minutes in it pretty much completely gives up on trying to generate suspense.  It features police so stupid it's impossible not to wonder if they can even figure out how to drink coffee.  It features a lot of scenes of Kal Penn being a pretentious douche that ultimately aren't funny and probably don't belong in a thriller.  The pair of killers are completely undeveloped and unmotivated.  There's a minimum of onscreen violence, at least until the finale when The Girl in the Photographs tries to make up for lost time and turn into a thriller again.

Can you say the words complete misfire--as in a movie where almost nothing works and where things are so bad it's hard to even fathom what kind of movie the creative minds behind The Girl in the Photographs thought they were making?  This is the kind of project you really wish had died before anybody actually had the chance to begin filming.  It's utterly worthless, stupid garbage that wastes slick production values, talented actors and the time of unfortunate viewers because it has no script to speak of--just a lot of barely connected nothing that makes me wonder where people actually get the money to film garbage like this.  There must be thousands of better scripts collecting dust in desk drawers all over Los Angeles--so how did this pathetic excuse for a film actually get made?  Probably somebody with too much money and too little talent who thought he was a genius even though he can't make an even halfway passable horror film.  In case I didn't make myself abundantly clear avoid this garbage and if you personally know the person who directed this, consider punching him in the face because he deserves it for unleashing this pretentious, masturbatory garbage upon the world where it will only make innocent viewers suffer.",1459728000,7,3561,4.8448844884488445

7671689,5,B01C3JYH4A,"Absolutely loved it. As a horror movie buff, I was going into this expecting little to none with this indie version of a scary film. But its plot kept me interested and intrigued. Would highly recommend.",1459468800,5,203,4.666666666666667
7671690,3,B01C3JYH4A,"Colleen (Claudia Lee) is a check out girl in the small town of Spearfish, S.D. (actual place filmed on location). She finds photos of what appear to be dead girls with the face mutilated beyond recognition. The cops can't find a crime or anything illegal. She is on her own. We know she has a boyfriend Ben (Toby Hemingway) she has been blowing off.  Peter Hemmings (Kal Penn) is an obnoxious photographer from the same town. He reads Colleen's blogs about the photos and opts to take his crew of models to Spearfish to shoot them in death poses. Rose (Miranda Rae Mayo) is one of the models and the current girlfriend of Peter and they carry on a love-hate relationship filled with barbs.

We see the killers, first with masks and then without. Their characters were never developed.  The  theme is stated early on ""There is in fact something obscene and sinister about photography, a desire to imprison, to incorporate, a sexual intensity of pursuit"". - William S. Burroughs

Peter builds upon that theme and claims, ""We covet what we see everyday"" i.e. the cashier in a way is a local celebrity, seen and admired by many.

The film also used some decent ""B"" stars, one of which I really liked and they wax her in the first scene. Kal Penn carried much of the film with his lines and eccentric nonsense. And while this was a ""slasher"" film in that people are horrifically killed, it didn't feel like a slasher as the photography displaced much of it. The film is more developed than most horrors, but (plot spoiler?) there is no clever twist.

7671692,1,B01C3JYH4A,"This started out to be a very interesting thriller , I can see in reality that movies have got to have all kinds of characters in them but I only have one problem with some movies is the profanity out of some movies  in this movie  Kal Penn who played the photographer I could not stand as soon as I heard him talking I knew I would not finish the movie I have never met but I am sure there are people out there speak and every other word is profanity but I cannot sit and watch a film and listen to it in my opinion this character Ruined this film sorry.",1467504000,,555,3.9464285714285716

7671696,3,B01C3JYH4A,"Oh.....this movie is so wonderful for the first hour and then quickly devolves. It's so much worse when a film has clear promise and then suddenly fails for no reason.

The lead in to the movie has references to other popular horror films like Silence of the Lambs, The Others, and Peeping Tom. Sadly if you reference great movies, you better be sure your film is just as good otherwise it simply highlights that despite your understanding of the genre, you've made a sub par product.

It is worth it to see Kal Penn cast against type a ""bro"" photographer. In the end, that's really the only worthwhile part of the film. Honestly, you're better off rewatching Scream than this film.",1465430400,2,682,4.628099173553719
7671697,2,B01C3JYH4A,"I'm not really sure what photograph there were even talking about.  This movie wasn't memorable at all.  It's been a few weeks since I watched it and honestly, I can barely remember it.  I do remember thinking when it was over that this was a really bad movie and what the heck did the mean by a girl in a photograph because it didn't really have anything to do with the movie.",1464652800,,377,4.208333333333333

7671702,3,B01C3JYH4A,"I thought Kal Penn being a total d**che was fun to watch.  Granted he was over the top and totally obnoxious but he was the only thing that kept me watching. I found the movie entertaining enough but I agree with the other reviewers that there was nothing so interesting that I couldn't turn away.  A small town creep is obsessed with a checkout girl, kills a bunch of people and leaves her pictures of the dead bodies.  He and his creepier friend also seem to be ale to get in and out of locked and/or occupied spaces without anyone even noticing. That's pretty much it.  Said checkout girl is only slightly freaked out by this and the local police not at all.  Not only does she not seem all that concerned, she doesn't figure out something is off when her best friend and her ex disappear.  There is no real explanation for the actions of the creepy guy other than he's obsessed and likes her hair up...but why?  why take the pics?...why the kitty thing?...and what's with that ending?  Entertaining enough to pass the time but wouldn't watch it again and wish I had waited for it to be free.",1461110400,,1095,4.412935323383085

7671705,3,B01C3JYH4A,"This was okay.. It was not amazing, but it was somewhat interesting. Its kind of like watching a thriller movie slowly unfold - although you already know who did it. You are almost watching this from two perspectives. I did not like the ending. It left too many unanswered questions.",1460592000,,283,4.68
7671706,3,B01C3JYH4A,"I'm giving this movie three stars because of the cinematography along with the realistic gore effects.  It's a straight up slasher movie, it's all been done before.  As such, I spent most of the movie waiting for some kind of twist to set it apart.  Especially since it's clearly a nod to Wes Craven and more specifically Scream.  It has none of the charm that Scream had and there is no twist.  What you see is what you get.  No guessing who the killer(s) is or what the motivation is.  The movie plays its cards too early and so has to rely on the brutality of its well shot gore (Rob Zombie would be proud).  Gore aside, sorry Eli Roth fans, this movie is missing substance, plot, thrills.  It passes the time perfectly fine but I would never watch it again.  Not on principal or anything, I just think a sesond viewing would bore me to tears whereas I've seen Scream a bunch of times.  You can see all the effort that was put into making this movie and yet you feel a certain laziness about it too.  Everything is laid out before you so early on that you feel like you're watching something that's going through the motions.  I suppose there is some suspense in who wil live who will die but that's every slasher movie ever made.  This movie needed something different, something that popped and made me say, ""Huh, didn't see that coming.""  Well I saw all of it coming and certainly not because I'm so smart I deduced it beforehand.  The fact that Kal Penn is the actor who gets main billing is a testament to the fact that the movie can't rely on its own substance to pull you in.  I would say the fact that Kal Penn's character is more of a parody than a real person doesn't help this movie at all.  In the end you have a pure vanilla slasher movie with a very good depiction of death, some clever cinematography and not much else.",1460505600,,1837,4.3061224489795915
7671707,2,B01C3JYH4A,It is a shame that Wes cravens name was even  associated with this abortion of a so called horror/slasher. I understand that Wes passed away before  this project was finished however what we have here is such an uneven jumbled mess of unexplained character motive and endless blood splatter for no apparent reason. The ending is as clueless as the story and its director.,1460419200,,371,4.78125
7671708,3,B01C3JYH4A,I loved Kal Penn playing a Terry Richardson esque douchebag -fashion photographer  who's burnt out and jaded so when he notices a serial killer from his hometown is posing  dead women to mimic his photos he's intrigued enough to go visit with his entourage. There are lots of plotholes and the serial killer is your typical one dimensional obsessive creep who covets the checkout girl at a local supermarket.  It had the potential to be great but it failed due to a lackluster script. Still worth it though if you hate the misogynist and shallow being celebrated.,1460246400,,563,4.783505154639175

8752107,5,B01C3JYH4A,"This review is for Wes Craven. The Girl With The Photographs is the last film that Wes Craven produced before he died. I saw the film on Netflix today and I have a lot to say about it. The film was very original, smart and most of all, fun. The one thing about this movie that broke my heart was the dedication to Wes Craven in the end credits. He was a great man with a heart for the horror films we loved now. His films influenced up and coming directors to create horror films of their own. His films like A Nightmare On Elm Street, the Scream Series, Cursed and My Soul To Take have influenced me into brainstorming ideas for movies i'm going to write eventually. I was really mad that this movie was not sold in stores but Netflix saved my life. What I liked about the film is that it has a great concept of the killers, a great story, characters and death scenes. Nick Simon of The Pyramid became Wes Craven's protege and made this film. I saw the reviews for this film and I was like, ""WHY THE HATE?!?!"" but you know what they say, haters gonna hate. I think The Girl In The Photographs is an original slasher film with the spirit of Wes Craven.
