3711955,5,B001N6FPRI,"In 2007, director Aamir Khan (""Earth"", ""Ghulam"", ""Ishq"", ""Rangeela"" and a long list of other popular films) and writer/creative director Amole Gupte began work on ""Taare Zameen Par"" (Like Stars on Earth).  After its screening in theaters, the film received was critically acclaimed, amassed several awards but most importantly raised awareness of dyslexia in India but also around the world.

Now this remarkable film is available on DVD in the US from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment with a special 3-disc set which includes a bonus DVD with special features and the original soundtrack for the film.  Plus two postcards featuring the two award winning artwork from the film.

""Like Stars on Earth"" revolves around an 8-year-old boy named Ishaan Awashthi (played by Darsheel Safary), a boy who is repeating his third-grade.  A child who is imaginative and also creative but once he sees words or mathematical problems, they are backwards.  But because of this, it affects his young life and teachers including his family look at him as disobedient and always causing problems.

Unfortunate for Ishaan, things continue to get worse and worse and it comes to the point that his parents, especially his father has had enough of his disobedience and sends him off to boarding school.

Young Ishaan doesn't understand why his parents did this and now a young boy without a family continues in boarding school and yet again, the teachers and students don't understand what his problem is.  That is until a new art teacher named Ram Shankar Nikumbh arrives and having worked with children with disabilities, he is drawn to Ishaan because he is depressed and often scolded and feels the need to help him.

Seeing Ishaan as a little boy who's spirit has been crushed by the adults and people around him, Ram discovers something special about the boy and now, more than anything, wants to help him before its too late.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Like Stars on Earth"" is a beautiful film presented in Widescreen (2:35:1 - enhanced for 169 televisions).  Capturing various areas of India but also inclusion of breathtaking scenes.  One thing that helped is Khan's commitment to perfection, from the scenery and the shots that he wanted, together with cinematographer M. Sethuraaman, they managed to capture many pieces of scenes that show the emotional side of Ishaan but also capturing the many children at the school and the various surroundings.  Vibrant colors matches its artistic presentation.  Picture quality is very well done as you can expect from a Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment release.

As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, English and Hind Language tracks.  I watched the film with both audio and first, the English dub is terrific.  Although not explained, I'm guessing that the talent re-recorded the dialogue in English and these are not dubbed English tracks that sound Western.  Fantastic English dubbing and one of the best dub jobs I've seen on a live action film that remained true to the original film.  Ff course, the Hindi track is well-done and dialogue is clear and understandable on both audio tracks.  Also, the music is very nice and clear as well.  Audio is mostly front and center channel driven but I preferred to watch the film with stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.

Subtitles are in English and Hindi.

I really hope that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment considers releasing this film on Blu-ray because it sports beautiful visuals and audio.  It's one of those films that you definitely want to see in HD.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Fantastic!  And definitely an easy, deserving pick for one of the best DVD releases in the US for a foreign film for 2010.

Before watching this film, I was intrigued that Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment picked up an Indian film for release but I'm glad they did.  ""Like Stars on Earth"" is a wonderful film that is just heartwarming and captivating that I really enjoyed the message of how children with dyslexia can grow up to become talented individuals.  People such as Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci and even Walt Disney himself were among people who grew up with dyslexia during a time when people didn't know what it was and I would assume, like Ishaan's character, had challenges in early childhood that probably were heartbreaking.

The fact that the film has changed things and risen awareness in India is wonderful but most importantly, for US viewers, I think it also drives home the fact that any child who has some sort of disability, it's not the end.  With help, these children can grow up to be talented individuals.

It's a shame that the film was not selected for consideration for an Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Film"" and part of the reason is that the film is quite long at 165 minutes and that it has a lot of musical content.  And I applaud director Aamir Khan for not cutting up the film just to achieve an award.  There is a reason why this film is long and it's a story arc to show Ishaan being misunderstood, to Ishaan being separated from his family and attending boarding school and the final arc in which his teacher notices his special talent and tries to help him overcome dyslexia.  As for the music, what kind of Indian film would this be without the music. Music is important to this film and even those little bits of pieces of scenes included in the music is important and yes, although the music is featured in longer duration and not short pieces, it would be very difficult to cut out.

As for the DVD release, I applaud Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment for releasing the film with the DVD and bonus DVD but also the inclusion of the musical soundtrack.  In the past, when it came to foreign films, this was seen as a positive for those releasing Japanese movie, anime or video game soundtracks and it only fostered the growth in the US and internationally.  I want to see more of this from Walt Disney and the film features beautiful music from Shankar Mahadevan, Loy Mendonsa, Ehsaan Noorani and more.

For parents who are interested in purchasing the film.  It is worth it and I watched it along with my six-year-old.  There is scenes of violence but it is integral to the film to show how the character of Ishaan is seen different not just by his teachers and family but also other kids.  Because he has been told that he's wrong all the time and has this disability, his spirit has been crushed and although he doesn't react and doesn't speak that much, the kids pick on him and there is a scene where he does get hurt, he leaves school but its important to watch and explain things to your kids about those scenes.  This happens earlier on in the film but trust me, there is a great reward once you reach the end of the film.

The film is truly heartwarming, inspiring and I admit it made me shed a couple of tears.  Overall, ""Like stars on Earth"" is a fantastic release and definitely is highly recommended! A+",1263254400,56,9154,4.823453608247423
3711956,5,B001N6FPRI,"This movie is fantastic--beautifully crafted and for the most part accurate in its portrayal of what a dyslexic child goes through. There is artistic license as with any attempt to portray on film the mental imagery a mind expresses, but before this movie is over, you too will get it (ie, understand what our schools are doing to dyslexic children--yes, US schools are as bad at the emotional abuse). As a tutor of dyslexic adults and children, I was moved to tears at the presentation of the desolation and self-doubt this boy experiences before a gifted teacher helps him. I see this in every person I start working with.

This should be a must view movie for everyone! Get it, then you'll get it!",1260403200,2,700,4.645161290322581
3711957,5,B001N6FPRI,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Being a father of two children, this movie opens your eyes & changes your attitude towards children. At times, we as parents, fail to understand our own children & instead of helping them, we tend to ignore their capabilities & limitations. This movie portrays that same failure.

Though this movie tackles the subject of a dyslexic child, I personally feel that the message can apply to any child. Every child is different. It is important to understand every child differently and recognize his or her weakness and talent. That is so well picturized in this movie.

The movie goes on to show that there is so much pressure on the little children to do well in all aspects of life. That pressure can bury the child's own desire to do something different.

I would really recommend this movie for every parent. Not just parents but to everyone. This movie should be shown in all schools across India & abroad. As parents and teachers, it is important for us to help children by understanding them & not by pressuring them to perform well.

Great masterpiece by Aamir Khan. I'm a little disappointed that the movie is coming on DVD so late after the original was released last year (2008).",1239753600,17,1237,4.634703196347032
3711958,5,B001N6FPRI,"I am only two weeks shy of turning 59, but I have to say this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This story of a child shunned by his teachers, his own father, his peers, as someone who is lazy and does not apply himself to the way of success is happening in India, but could be happenning anywhere in the modern world.

He has trouble with reading and writing as letters seem dancing in front of his eyes. Everyone blames him for not concentrating and trying harder instead of even considering he may be suffering from dyslexia.

I am not going to say more about him because I do not want to spoil the story of this beautiful film.

The film is bilingual, Hindi and English. I am quite concerned that Amazon is listing English as the only language for this release. Surely there is enough room on a 3-DVD set for two tracks, the original and the English dub! That is an absolute must, a condition without which I have no intention of buying it.

Even though I do not speak Hindi, the use of the two languages intertwined so freely adds to the charm and beauty of this movie. I could follow the story quite well even if I did not understand the Hindi words. The acting and the cinematography were so good that understanding the Hindi words was not necessary.

Please, Disney, do not insult our intelligence by butchering this masterpiece!",1239062400,35,1347,4.393574297188755

It seems to be divided into three sections the first is the experience of having not having diagnosis disability resulting in many hurtful comments by teachers, parents and peers. The second receiving a diagnosis that results in hope and understanding the third is learning there are many forms of intelligence that if valued and supported become strength.

3711982,5,B001N6FPRI,"""Like Stars on Earth"" is completely captivating in every way.  The story is compelling because it involves a too-common but mystifying disability, depicted in the story as a frustrating naughtiness in a little boy who can't understand why he fails, and a milieu that treats him harshly.
But the treatment of the teacher who grasps his dilemma and works with him to overcome it isn't just a feel-good recovery story like ""The Miracle Worker"".  Aamir Khan gives Ram Shankar a depth and humanity that goes beyond how Hollywood treats children and their problems.  You feel Ram Shankar's emotions as he watches his developmentally disabled pupils in another school, and his affection for Ishaan is real.
The story is told with beauty in the settings, the paintings, and the musical sound track.  The added feature of ""Mr. Aamir"" disclosing his directorial decisions and his thoroughness in all aspects of the shooting is a genuine joy.

3711987,5,B001N6FPRI,"Like Stars on Earth is a movie produced by Bollywood. It is about an eight years old kid whose name is Eshan. Eshan was a boy who had lots of wonders, always straying, and always daydreaming. He was having a hard time at school, as it was difficult for him to read, write or solve math problems. His parents couldn't handle his low level; they thought maybe it was better for him to join a boarding school to get the attention he needs. However, things didn't change. What they didn't know was that reason behind the boys struggle was that he had dyslexia.

 Being away from his family and always scolded and punished for his low level was too much for the boy that he got depressed. Then a new teacher joined the school; he used to have a different philosophy of teaching. He thought that children learn better by fun and games. All children were happy in his class except for Eshan; the teacher noticed that and couldn't accept it. He visited his family to ask them about him and looked through his previous profiles to discover that the boy had dyslexia; he helped him a lot get over his problem and build his confidence. At the end of the movie he also discover another important thing; the boy was a gifted artiest.

I really recommend watching this movie especially for teachers because it shows them that they should think about the students feelings before they react to their low level and that they should think about the reason of their struggle. It also teaches people that people with special needs need love, support and attention, and that blame and scolding are the least things they deserve.

Like Stars on Earth was released in 2007 in the UK. The heroes of the movie are Darsheel Safary who played the role of Ishaan Awasthi and the famous Bollywood actor Amir Khan who played the role of Ram Shankar Nikumbh, the teacher who helped Eshan. Darsheel Safary played his role very wittily. Although he is a child, he could really reflect to us the feeling of any child in his possition. As all Bollywood movies, Like Stars on Earth has many songs and dances; all of them are related to the scenes.

The movie discusses about several social issues. One of them is the non-awareness of mental disorders, dyslexia is an example here. Another issue is the influence of teachers on students life, and how can teachers make students happy, confident or depressed. The last issue is patriarchal system; Ishans father used to make all decisions and doesnt give his wife any chance to discuss or share her opinion.",1441065600,2,2520,4.616071428571429

It is a testimony to his talent- the way the movie wisely and delicately brings out a beautiful message. And though it brings forth awareness about dyslexia, yet it is about so much more- it speaks about how important it is for children to be nurtured and encouraged. And then on a deeper level it just connects to the isolation we have all felt in some way or other in life- even if most of us not gone through the same learning disability as Ishaan (the eight year old protagonist) yet his helplessness and hurt somehow touches the child in us- once helpless and fragile. I have yet to meet someone who did not cry or choke up while watching this movie.

3712004,5,B001N6FPRI,"I should start by saying that it is a total shame that this movie has not been widely accepted. *This* is the kind of movie we should fill our screens with, not the trash that occupies many Americans TV's. Having been a child that was treated in an extremely similar way, both in school and at home (Though not dyslexic by any means), this touched my heart deeply, and at many times, had me in tears of joy and sadness.

It is a crime to herd our children and force them to conform to such uniformity. As the message behind the movie states, children of all types are unique and special, and should be treated as such. To see them mistreated in various forms of violence is sickening.

Back on track... The cinematography was incredible and had me wondering if this was actually a true story with ""real"" people instead of actors (Yes, some of them were true to life, but I mean as far as the main actors go). I personally enjoyed the shots of the countryside, as well as the everyday life of everyday people in India.

The score was also incredible; chock full of real lyrics with real meaning. Not only were the lyrics rich, but the instrumentals were very pleasing as well. (Not much to say here. But seriously, the music was just as good as the movie)

Bottom line is, this movie is phenomenal. I just got done watching it and will be buying it and sharing it with anyone who is willing to watch. Absolutely a masterpiece.",1412121600,2,1425,4.406844106463878

3712008,4,B001N6FPRI,"Aamir Khan seems to like to make very long films in which he is usually one of the leading actors.  I came to ""Like Stars On Earth"" (the English name for its Disney International DVD release) by way of his even longer (2 hours 54 minute) comedy ""Three Idiots"" (which I heartily recommend to anyone who likes Bollywood films, or thinks they might, and who has three hours to spare).  This film is only 2 hours and 45 minutes, where ""only"" is relative.  The first hour depicts the frustrations of a boy, his parents, and his teachers as he falls through the cracks.  In a society where education is dedicated to rote learning;  where creativity isn't encouraged and where everyone wants only ""toppers"" and ""runners""---kids who can ""run the race"", and win,  an 8 year old kid with crippling, undiagnosed dyslexia is seen as lazy, a duffer, an attitude problem.  And finally, after failing all of his courses and his second year in 3rd grade, he's punished by being sent off to a boarding school, high in the mountains, where the teachers are no better.  The art teacher is even worse, drawing geometric forms on a black board and ordering the children to copy them, perfectly, without a straight edge.

And then, the art teacher takes a job terrorizing students in New Zealand.  In comes Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Khan), as the temporary art teacher, taking the job in addition to his position at Tulips, a school for kids we would call developmentally disabled;  the very picture of big brotherly compassion and understanding  (and unorthodox teaching) who begins to realize that the frightened, almost catatonic little boy might have problems beyond being unwilling, or unable, to participate in classes, so he sets out to find out if his suspicions are correct---seeing a bit of his own dyslexic self in this kid.  From there, for about the last half of the film, things begin to turn up for everyone (especially the kid, and the audience).

Like all Bollywood films, this is something of a musical.  Unlike any of the other Bollywood films I've seen, the music here tends not to arise from some silly story point and build to absurdly delightful proportions, but, arises to explain the little boy's view to the outside world, who isn't seeing him.  Unfortunately, while written in Hindi, the music is decidedly Western---as in the hometown radio station that plays the sort of ""easy rock"" that is advertised as being ""good for the office"".  Yecch.  You see a lot of films about Mexican Americans that feature salsa, cumbia, and other caribbean beats not native to Mexico---where none of the tunes even suggests the oom-pah-oom-pah quebreditas or lilting rancheros still so popular  in Mexico or heard in the US Mexican communities.  At least a merengue is nice to listen to; easy rock in a Bollywood epic is about as annoying as going to an Indian restaurant and finding they've subbed the Indian spices for something easier to find, and watered down the curry so it wouldn't be too rich.

Ah well.  Unlike a lot of Hollywood films (""Maleficent"" and the ""Hobbit"" franchise) where the music is constant, and overwhelming, the music here is only irritating.

Over all this was nearly 3 hours of film that was mostly well spent---it would benefit from some good editing nonetheless.  If you've got that time to invest (unlike ""Three Idiots"" you do have to invest a bit of yourself in the first hour of the film at least, if you want to get anything out of it) it is worth it.  The movie takes its time to really develop Ishaan's character, and to help the audience feel for him, and then it takes more time to figure out what's wrong, and what to do about it, something Western films achieve much faster, although not necessarily any better.  I can see why, when compared to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" this film did not get an Oscar, something that rankled Indian audiences and it's not that it's a purely Indian film (as opposed to the other, which was British).  Then again, lots of fine films never got an Oscar, and Lauren Bacall just died without one as well.  Hey, there's probably a Polar Vortex coming your way soon, or a Hurricane Watch, and you'll have that three hours you'll need!",1408233600,,4180,4.736187845303867

Anyway this movie made me cry in some scenes. My heart went out to the boy and I was reminded of myself as a child sometimes, not in that particular learning disability he had in the film but in other things and as far as being or  feeling different from other children, more sensitive and misunderstood, etc. maybe it's the old soul in me.

This is a story of a young kid who is fascinated by his own world but unable to function in the world around him. You see, he is artistic and creative, and the world swims around him as if he were a fish in a glass bowl full of colorful marbles. But he has some issues with hearing / seeing his outside world, and in communicating from his own world to those around him. He is bright, loving, creative, and even happy for a while, but he's seen as trouble.

His parents--who do love him--are perplexed, frustrated, even angry, and try several methods to get him to ""fit in,"" but nothing really works, so they send him away to a school which will cure him or break him.

He descends into further frustration and unhappiness, even though he meets friends who support him--until one day a manic new teacher arrives who is gifted and loving and happy, a man with his own family and kids, who finally sees into this boy and understands him.

This teacher ""gets"" him, and enables him to begin to relate to his outside world successfully, using art and love and compassion.

In the end the boy gets reconnected to his world--and his family.

He might not be as tall as both, or have the dancing skills of one, but when it comes to movies his talent, and his intellect, are lethal. In fact, if you read anything about the man at all you will notice the phrase ""Mr. Perfectionist"" in place of his name in at least two places. But lots of people are talented and intelligent, what sets Mr. A. Khan a part from his most of his fellow Khans is that he'll take on things that a 'typical Bollywood Star' just doesn't do. Whether it's a Revolution against the British using Cricket in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lagaan-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B003YR0GRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lagaan, Anniversary Edition</a>&nbsp;with a potential romance with an English woman, a man who ruthlessly hunts down the gangsters who killed his girlfriend and destroyed his short term memory in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghajini/dp/B001TLWRBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghajini</a>, the man takes risks.

From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dil-chahta-hai/dp/B0016GOM0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dil chahta hai</a>&nbsp;to the upcoming Dhoom 3 there isn't anything he won't take on if he has a passion for it. Fortunately for all lovers of great films, he is first a foremost a lover of movies and decided acting in them just wasn't enough.

""Like Stars On Earth, Every Child Is Special"" is a directorial debut and it combines the two great passions of Mr. A. Khan, movie making, and social issues. The modern world of today is fiercely competitive and nowhere is that more inculcated into a society than in the schoolroom, by the time a child is out of the second grade these days college is already being pounded into their minds. Don't get me wrong, I wish I could've finished college. But what happens when a child doesn't live up to the ""standards"" set by our modern ways of thinking? What happens when the child is misunderstood, and what is thought of as laziness or naughtiness, is actually a cry for help? What happens when expectations are so high and failure is the ultimate disgrace. What truly defines success? These are all questions that are put forth in this film and handled with a truly elegant and refined manner. It's not an original story, but The Bard himself never had an original story in his entire life.

Ishaan Awasthi, is an eight year old boy from a middleclass family in Mumbai, and he is a ""Problem Child"" with a capital P-C. His highest scores on tests are two's and three's out of twenty. He's belligerent, defiant, inattentive, and wherever he goes chaos seems to follow. His teachers are fed up not wanting to have him in the third grade for the third time. His father, goes around roaring like a lion convinced that his youngest son is destined to be a failure in life. His mother wavers between acute frustration, despair, and worry for her beloved child. At her wits end, she cannot understand why all her love, teaching, and effort, seem to do nothing to improve Ishaan's grades, or his behavior. His older brother Yohan, is a top student and athlete, everything Ishaan is not. Yohan is the only person in Ishaan's life that isn't angry with him. To make matters worse, Ishaan doesn't know why he is the way he is and the few times he tries to express his problem he's greeted with anger and ridicule.

Our cast of characters may not know what the problem is, but we the audience are hit in the face with it in the first frame. Disney did an incredible job with the animations here, the colors and the chaos of flipping and floating letters, numbers, and sentences in the images builds frustration in we the viewers as we're immersed into to the clamor of Ishaan's mind. It's overwhelming, and combining that with the pressures from the outside world, we're thrown into the deep end of Ishaan's suffering. But we're also thrown into his genius.

I won't tell anymore about the story because you can figure out where it's going. But, I will say that the performances and direction in this movie are superlative. Darsheel Safary, is... wow I can't think of an adjective to describe just how good he is. For a *then* nine year old to match the intensity, and naturalness of his costars in his film debut is astounding! This young man (now around 15) has got the ability to use his eyes to let you deep into his soul, and I personally was struck by the depth of his sensitivity and understanding, and the fact that he could be downright unlikable in one scene where he deliberately troubles his mother. His naturalness never wanes even for a moment. Now that he's a young man, I hope that he has amazing success no matter where life takes him. I also hope that he's proud of this film until his last breath, it's a bigger accomplishment than most people will have in their whole lives.

A super protagonist needs an equally good antagonist to truly shine and Vipin Sharma is the perfect foil here; as the success obsessed, driven, father. There are times in this movie when he arouses the very deepest hatred. My mom literally said ""This man is evil"" something that shocked me because she raised two kids with special needs, and if anyone knows the strain and helplessness that goes with that it's her. I replied, ""Ammi, he's not capable of understanding what Ishaan is going through anymore than Ishaan can understand his letters right now."" Now, don't get me wrong, that doesn't absolve his cruelty but who wants to sit through a three hour movie where you have a father of a young boy that you hate from beginning to end? The script, Mr. A. Khan's direction, and Mr. Sharma's performance is layered with moments where you feel compassion and you grieve for the fact that the man is so limited in his mindset, and how painful it is as he slowly comes to terms with the fact that his entire belief system is damaging his child. A truly great role that enhances Darsheel Safary's performance.

Tisca Chopra, is an actress I'm totally unfamiliar with thus far. Her performance as Ishaan's mother I felt was pretty flawless, she inhabited the role of a middleclass housewife and a devoted but frazzled mother in a natural and unaffected way. The bond between mother and son, felt genuine and warm which is the perfect counterbalance to the relationship between father and son.

Special shout out to Sachet Engineer as Yohan. The perfect son, who wishes he wasn't quite so perfect. It's such a minor role, but it's vital, because in the first half of the film he's the positive voice, the cheerleader for Ishaan. Without it, the first half would be far too heavy and heart-wrenching.

Tanay Chheda, is another boy who befriends Ishaan and struggles physically. I have to say, that kid deserves lots of applause for wearing the leg brace even though he's healthy in real life. I had to wear the same brace at that age for real and they hurt. So I want his performance appreciated despite it's brevity.

Mr. A. Khan's performance is of course, up to his reputation. So, let's talk about his Direction... He's a part of the school of directors in Hindi cinema that blends the wonderful traditions of the past, and the more polished narrative style of the modern day. And why not, he's produced movies by the great Ashutosh Gowariker, and worked under the direction of Farhan Akhtar? Add to that, a venerable Bollywood pedigree, and his complete dedication and it's a home run; or perhaps I should say he's hit a sixer! He put together a fantastic team and each frame is carefully thought out and a true labor of love. If there is one area Mr. A. Khan doesn't not quite excel it's in dance but that works here. And to give the man serious kudos he's honest and doesn't take credit for his dance number when he didn't direct it.

Music: The dynamic trio of Shankar, Loy, and Ehsaan craft a truly perfect complimentary score to the movie. The songs are beautiful, the melodies that fit every part of the narrative. But make no mistake, the songs do not carry this movie as they do in other Bollywood films.  ""Bum Bum Bole"" is my mom's favorite and I don't blame her, it's a joyful celebration of carefree innocence. But my personal favorite is ""Maa"" so perfect for the bond in childhood, but if one is blessed, then it becomes even more true in adulthood.

I can't recommend this movie enough and my three disc set comes with some exceptional goodies...

1. Disc 1 the movie with a Hindi Track but also dubbed in English. I first saw this movie on Netflix with the Hindi Track and used the subtitles which you can also choose. But I also watched the English dubbed version. It was extremely well done, but truthfully I prefer the Hindi.

2. Disc 2 special features with full subtitles available. Deleted scenes, a making of documentary which you should watch, and a panel with Aamir Khan and prominent teachers, neurologists, and experts on dyslexia and other learning and behavioral problems that effect children such as ADD ADHAD Downs Syndrome, and even Cerebral Palsy. It's mainly meant to reach out to people who hesitate to act when their children have difficulties, and a not-too-subtle nudge to the educators of India to look beyond the typical ""the child is naughty or lazy"" attitude when they see a child struggling in their class. Still, it's worth a look. Aamir Khan is one of India's most visible and prominent humanitarians of this decade even making the cover of Time Magazine and it's list of 100 most influential people. There's also trailers, still shots, to look through.

3. Disc 3 is the entire soundtrack in it's glory. To be extra sweet they also include mini-prints of the paintings in the film.

Everything is exceptional in quality and the price extremely reasonable so do not skimp. I can't recommend this film enough and after the last two Bollywood movies I reviewed this has re-ignited my passion and my obsession.",1370217600,7,10311,4.813664596273292

3712065,5,B001N6FPRI,"You can read the other reviews to see how great the movie was. I just wanted to clarify one thing:

The CD you receive is more of a score instead of a soundtrack. I didn't read the track listing before buying (though it doesn't matter, since I bought it for the movie and the CD was just bonus). So it doesn't have the actual songs I really wanted, like ""Maa"", ""Bum Bum Bole"", ""Mera Jahan"" etc... I found those on iTunes, however. Also, if you search ""taara Zameen Par"" here on Amazon it will pull up two different albums that have the songs on them, though with different names. For example, ""Bum Bum Bole"" is called ""Dekho Dekho"". It's rather confusing.

So, the point of this review is so people aren't surprised when they pop in the CD in the CD player and can't find those popular songs, like I was. Either way, hey, free soundtrack with the price of the movie.",1309651200,,866,4.339506172839506

3712070,5,B001N6FPRI,"The other reviewers did such a good job, I can't possibly say it better.  I watched this film tonight with my husband and 2 kids (ages 12 and 11).  The film has many special effects and music that can keep kids their age interested.  We were all glued, even though a few parts were kind of long (the film is almost 3 hours in length).  The music is beautiful, just perhaps a bit too much of it (not too much for me; just for the kids and my husband who are used to 1.5 hours max).  However, the story and how well it is portrayed far outweigh any possible criticism.

Personal connection:  My son was exhibiting signs of possible dyslexia in about the 2nd and 3rd grade, but I could not get the school to test him.  The only legitimate tester I could find was about 200 miles away, and expensive.  Once the school convinced me he didn't have it, I didn't push the testing.  The school struggled with him, but overall, they did a pretty good job of bringing him up to speed (sort of).  After we watched the film, I asked my son if he recognized any of Ishaan's (the main character) problems.  He replied, ""oh yeah:  the spelling problems, the backwards letters, the handwriting, the attention, the hard time tying things...""  (He doesn't remember it, but he was also slower to pick up reading.)  If my 12-year-old can recognize signs of dyslexia in himself, surely the school should have.

I had some other good discussions with my children after watching it - in particular, what they thought of how much power the mother had to change anything, and what they think she would have done if she could drive or had her own car, or had more say in how the family handled the issues.

An important film, and I highly recommend it to all educators (and future educators), parents (ALL of them), and children from the age of about 10 up.  I say children too because they can often be the cruelest to a struggling classmate, and they need to know.  The main character is so likeable that unless a child is already a bully, she'll come around to sympathize.  (Oh, and if you're a mother, bring a box of tissue.)",1287705600,5,2102,4.41038961038961

3712072,5,B001N6FPRI,"I originally wrote this review for a different DVD version of the movie but thought it was worth repeating here just because I think this is such a wonderful movie.

This is truly a gem of a film - a beautiful script by Amol Gupte, incredible incredible acting by the little boy who is the main character and very nice direction by Aamir Khan in his first attempt. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! The only awkward moment in the whole film is Aamir Khan's entrance, but fortunately that passes and you forget it as you get wrapped up in the beauty of the movie.

(SPOILER ALERT) The basic story is of a frustrated child who is failing in every aspect of school and is always in trouble and acting out as a result. His teachers, classmates and even his parents fail to see the intelligence behind his apparent academic failures. It takes a new teacher to recognize that he is, in fact, suffering from a learning disability (dyslexia) and has been so frustrated and misunderstood that he has spiralled into depression. The teacher reaches out to him and slowly teaches him to deal with his learning disability, and, more importantly, recognizes his other, wonderfully creative abilities, as well as his spirit and strength and nurtures those. (END SPOILER ALERT)

To say that this is an absolute gem of a movie is an understatement. Just to give you an idea of its impact, my father who is the most stoic movie watcher in the WORLD actually shed tears while watching this! This movie should be distributed to all the parents in India - to show them that the conformity mandated of children in all levels of society is a disease in itself, that creative talents can be just as wonderful and deserving of attention as academic successes, and to teach them about the differences in learning and ability that exist so that children are not simply labeled as stupid but can get the help they need to succeed.

Oh and the kid Darsheel Safary who plays the main character, Ishaan, is absolutely phenomenal. He communicates every nuance of emotion and story with very very few words. Honestly - of all the actors I've seen this past year, he deserves an oscar!!

8323298,2,B001N6FPRI,"I really, really wanted to abandon this film somewhere in the 1st hour or so. Though the protagonist clearly had a learning disability, the contempt and disrespect he exhibited made it impossible to feel empathy and affinity.  It is only when the Aamir Khan character shows up that this movie finds its way.  The art teacher's compassion and determination to right the path for a troubled young boy is heartwarming, but the story line and ending particularly  is too neatly wrapped up with a bow like a Disney fairy tale. That diminished the film for me.

As an aside, it is commonplace to see music used as a means to advance the narrative in Indian cinema, but it is deeply distracting and forced and cheesy in the first hour of the movie.
It is better employed in the latter half of the film.

I was intrigued to see this film based on the strong reviews, but ultimately found it somewhat disappointing. Aamir Khan's film Three Idiots is far better!",1514592000,,952,4.609467455621302

The movie is just over 2 bours long, and I have to say the movie drags it's ass for the first hour introducing the main child character, but it was written that way to develop the character and story. However, the movie picks up its pace once the main adult charater comes in half way through.

What makes this movie great is how the adult character explains to the childs parents how their childs disability is seen by the child and how the adult character reveals a hidden talent within the child.
