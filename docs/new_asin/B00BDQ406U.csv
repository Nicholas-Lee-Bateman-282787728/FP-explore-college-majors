I contacted Kona and More and they told me that this series was PAL.  Then they told me to return the box set and they would provide a refund for the purchased price. They did so and I am glad.  I got my refund.

Personal Note: NTSC ALL REGIONS may mean PAL.
I wish they had this series in DVD Video 9 format then I could see it. I got interested in the series because of the reviews on ROKUTEN.",1507680000,,541,3.855855855855856
8566765,4,B00BDQ406U,"Our family wholly enjoyed this drama (our kids are adults).  The story follows a cyber crime team solving various cyber crimes - but the central story is about a hidden/switched identity which leads to interesting twists and turns in the series.  The acting was well done over all, although So Ji Sub played his main character as very reserved, almost stiff.  Some of the best comic moments were by Kwak Do Wan playing the character of Crazy Cow (as translated in this DVD set).  At first, he is annoying and unlikeable but as the story progresses you begin to not only like him but cheer him on which is evidence of good writing and acting combined. Choi Daniel did a wonderful job with his character and I suspect we will be seeing more of him in future dramas.
The story also brought out how easily so much of our information can be stolen and manipulated by others via modern technology.
The only negatives (and why I can't give it five stars) - (1) a girl being pushed out a window of a high rise (a scene replayed many times) is disturbing as are crime photos shown (this is why I would not recommend this for young viewers). (2) another scene where a man is murdered by a poisoned drink is replayed so many times that we seriously believe that scene alone (when replayed side by side as many times as it was replayed during the series) would probably fill two whole episodes.
Overall, though, an enjoyable drama.",1373068800,3,1419,4.509727626459144
