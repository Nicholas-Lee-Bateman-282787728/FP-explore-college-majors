I thought it was hilarious. There are not a lot of comedies out there that have a decent plot -- this one does and it is well directed.",1329177600,8,296,3.7903225806451615
4504548,3,B004Z29W2Q,"""She wanted it, she told me to.""  Catalina (Vega) and her escort friends are at a high end party when senator Bill Krebb (McDonald) goes to far and one of the girls ends up dead.  Catalina takes the tape and runs.  An assassin is hired to find her and and get the tape back.  Catalina finds two private investigators who are just starting up to help her.  This is a movie that was actually pretty good, but the big problem was that it was a little too long.  There were some really exciting and fun action scenes and tense moments in this, but there were also some very slow paced and unnessecary scenes that slowed the movie down and kept it from being consistant the entire time.  Equal parts action and comedy made it a fun watch, but nothing to rush out and see either.  Overall, an entertaining movie that is worth watching once but that's about it.  I give it a B.",1324944000,,870,4.288343558282208
4504549,5,B004Z29W2Q,"I have to say, the trailer was okay but the movie was magnificent. Every step of the way was jaw dropping. Some of the things that occur are extreme but you can tell they didn't pull any punches and willingly stepped over certain lines to differentiate this film from others in the same category. Why more people aren't familiar with this flick? i don't know but I will recommend this to everyone i know that likes this drama",1321660800,14,425,4.461538461538462
4504550,5,B004Z29W2Q,"The movie opens with a high level party which includes many nude call girls. Cat (Paz Vega), one of the escorts at the party who managed to keep her clothes on, witnesses the killing of multiple guests, including other girls, is on the lam. She steals a car and phone from two Americans who provide the comic relief for the film  (Alphonso McAuley and Scott Mechlowicz). McAuley talks Scott into being a detective, ""C'mon man. Be a dic.""  They open up an office in a porno theater with secretary D.L. Hughley.

The nasty killing incident was caught on tape. Cat steals the hard drive from a computer before she leaves the party. An assassin, Helen aka Virginia Wolf (also goes by Emily Bronte), is called in to kill her. Played by Janet McTeer she reminded me of Helen Mirren in ""Red"". She has a dry humor to her as she is a polite ""Mary Poppins"" killer. In one scene she apologizes to a man she has tortured for ""taking up so much of his morning...but you do understand my need to be thorough."" She also has her own theme music (Zombies' ""She's not there"") which is part of the fun.

The whole world is searching for the missing Paz. Our hero detectives decide to make her their first case. Paz scams her way across Europe (funny how guys want to help a beautiful woman sporting legs and cleavage) and from TV news shows she realizes the killings involved an important US government official.

The movie creates wonderful characters. It has numerous funny lines and some with sexual innuendos, for instance:

Hughley claims the shark ate his wife piece by piece. McAuley asks, ""Didn't he eat her whole?"" Hughley, ""Yeah. He ate that too.""  While this simple juvenile humor might not work or seem crude in other movies, it was hilarious when they did it, primarily because they didn't harp on crude humor. Even the slap stick type humor was funny because it was quick and they didn't dwell on it. This is a 5 star movie even without the nudity. The movie works better as a comedy than an action film. Dasa Zivkovic who represented Montenegro in the Miss Universe pageant is Jieva, a girl that McAuley meets on the beach in Montenegro.

Excellent writing and direction. McAuley as a Scotsman, painfully impressive.

Full frontal nudity (""Debbie, Susi, Bubbles, Mila Savina""...not Paz), sex, good use of Zombie cover track, some quick torture scenes.",1320451200,27,2347,4.663438256658596

4504563,1,B004Z29W2Q,"I've enjoyed films by Tarantino and Guy Ritchie that are full of violence and quirky characters, because (usually) they get the timing and balance right so that the overall effect is comic and entertaining.  What we have here is a sort of Lock, Stock-type intro to characters, which itself is poorly done, the rapid editing characteristic to those two which here often leaves one bewildered as to what exactly is going on, and then a hitwoman who is kind of cool, but her ""humorous"" violence descends quickly into torture porn.  I gave up on this after the second torture, because I wasn't enjoying any of it and this whole movie had just annoyed me up to that point.

4504566,3,B004Z29W2Q,"After viewing this movie, to date I prefer Paz in her other movies playing more down to earth, ""regular person"" roles.  She gives a decent performance in this action movie, but for me the storyline/writing just wasn't on the level as say, The Professional, or Hitman.  No, she's not actually an assassin as the characters in those other two movies, but just giving those two examples for comparison as far as entertainment level.  Is this action movie starring Paz watchable and entertaining, yes, and the two supporting actors who come to aid her along the way do in fact help to carry this movie.  Hey, it's an inexpensive enough dvd from Amazon that it's worth it to purchase and watch with the missus.

Now, if you want to see a much more entertaining movie with the beautiful Paz, IMO, purchase and view 10 Items or Less co-starring Morgan Freeman.  That is entertaining and ""real"" at the same time.  She is perfect in that movie, so check it out!",1442448000,2,952,4.630952380952381

I had to stop watching after a half hour. I fast forwarded a little bit, and then skip-indexed until I just turned it off all together. It had two barely-humorous characters in over their head ""noir-style,"" but they weren't funny or interesting. There were supposed to be a lot of hot women, but they weren't really that hot. I guess it made me appreciate Tarantino a little more. At least I only paid $5 for it.",1404345600,,566,4.451923076923077
4504597,1,B004Z29W2Q,"You know how carnies have that knack of making you part with your cash by pretending that they can read your palm or tea leaves? That's what this movie reminds me of. I assume that the script for Cat Run was interpreted from scrunched-up toilet paper after a bout of diarrhea brought on by food poisoning from cheap kebab meat. If you gave mentally subnormal 8-year-olds toy guns and told them to run riot in the back yard they'd come up with a better plot behind the gunplay than whoever was responsible for the script to his breathtakingly abysmal film.

Cat (Paz Vega - who?) is at some political orgy shindig in Eastern Europe when everyone is suddenly killed and she finds herself marked for death and on the lam because ""she knows"". Many characters come and go over the running time, most of which seem to be occupying their own story as the movie feels very disconnected.

I've seen many poorly edited films in my time, but Cat Run wins the top prize by a million miles. Characters warp through space and time with no coherence or cohesion. Cat Run feels like three separate terrible movies chucked into a blender, fed to pigs, collected as faeces, then painted on the screen in brown smears. It is truly, mind-bogglingly, jaw-droppingly, agonizingly terrible.

The worst part of this brain torture is that Cat Run actually thinks it is smart and funny. John Stockwell's ""direction"" makes you long for the crude, childish eye candy of Michael Bay. It will even make you forgive Guy Richie for all his previous sins. Nothing, but nothing about this drek can possibly be any worse. The worst part is that he plays the violence for laughs, which is just simply obscene.

Shame on all involved. Who would want this on their resume? If you dropped Cat Run in a public toilet bowl it would regurgitate it back in your face.

You honestly think that there are worse films than this? There's not. At least Tommy Wiseau's The Room had some shred of nobility, no matter house misguided.

Do let this film come within a 100-mile radius of your life.

Cat Run is presented on Blu-ray in 2.35:1 1080p. To say that it looks good is like saying that your last bowel movement looked like Jennifer Lawrence. The sound is in DTS HD-MA, but I'd rather listen to the sound of nails being hammered into my ears. Do I sound like I even care what extras there are?",1402790400,2,2348,4.562945368171022

4504626,3,B004Z29W2Q,"John Stockwell has directed a fair handful of middleweight films, and though this one shows promise, some bad decisions in concept, writing and editing kept it from being really good.

Here's the scoop. A high ticket party in Eastern Europe, replete with high ticket call girls and a high level U.S. official, comes under fire and almost everyone gets killed. One of the call girls escapes with an encrypted hard drive containing some very sensitive information. The bad guys need her out of the way. Meanwhile an American expatriate in Montenegro, with a failing restaurant, hooks up with an old friend to start a detective agency and ends up on the case to save the girl's life.

This has a lot of flash and style. It has a similar flare to a Guy Ritchie flick. The characters' names and titles flash in bold font on the screen as their introduction. There is a lot of clever patter and over the top situations. But there is a nastiness about it. Some innocent bystanders get unnecessarily killed. There is some gruesome torture in a couple of scenes and an overall disregard for human life. The characters are quite colorful. The hero, played by Scott Mechlowicz, is a decent, bright and observant guy. He's contrasted well by Alphonso McAuley as the hip, coloful partner, Julian. Paz Vega might be a good actor. She's so stunning I can't get past looking at her to determine if she is or not. Janet McTeer does a really sweet job as the assassin Helen Bingham, who uses the names of various famous, female authors as aliases. The secondary characters all do a decent job.

Another problem arose in the editing. I don't know if there is another version of this floating around but there was a transition between two scenes where the characters couldn't possibly have known what they knew without at least one other scene tying the two together. That was a glaring error. There was other stuff, a lot of stuff in fact, that was so over the top it took an already over the top approach and launched it into the stratosphere. For instance there was a scene where an innocent guy gets blown away outside the hotel room where some tense things are going down. Minutes later a bunch of magicians flood the same room. What happened to the body and all the blood, outside the room, from the first victim? Another glaring error.

This was a lot of fun to watch and I had a good time for the most part. But some bad decisions made the viewing uncomfortable. Had those decisions been made better this could have been a solid notch higher.",1350000000,,2530,4.603104212860311

4504633,2,B004Z29W2Q,"Negatives first, or positives first? OK, get it over with.

Negatives:
If you're still into comics books then this movie is a natural. Comic book visuals' knockoffs i.e. interspersed throughout the movie are cheaply drawn, within multiple rectangles, snapshots of different events unfolding at once - done before, boring; frequent graphics with a cheap world map showing a little airplane and dotted lines as it moves from city to city (a cheap way of not filming in those cities but pretending to); similarly are lots of comic drawings introducing each character. Examples, a sketch and brief bio is shown for each of the following characters: The Ukraine Enforcer, The Boss, The Pervert, The Loner, The Extrovert, The Exhibitionist, The Survivor, The Seeker, The Assassin, The Client. You can tell by the list that the characters are weighted heavily toward stereotypes.

A not too creative plot of the usual Eastern European bad guy losing his incriminating hard drive to his girl friend who has run off. A hit girl is hired to get it back and kills a lot of people in the process. Interjected into this well worn plot are a couple of searching-for-themselves guys who start a detective agency and guess who they're hired to track down - yep, the girl with the hard drive.

Props a bit hokey like manequins and green screen for people who lose a body part or two; bullet hole decals that always seem to be precisely placed in the middle of the forehead. Usual unlimited ammo. Not a good flow in the directing and filming - disjointed.

Positives:
Nudity (but not cover model level) for the guys, and one for the girls. Acting was, for the most part, worth the rental despite the overly stereotyped roles. Action scenes were written, filmed, acted and propped well enough to overcome the been-done-before syndrome. Enough minor twists in the story to be entertaining and to keep from dozing off.",1342656000,5,1897,4.863777089783282
4504634,4,B004Z29W2Q,"A very entertaining movie. It starts off a bit slow, but the longer you watch, the better it gets, right up to the end. Once Janet (Do you need a moment) McTeer is hired as a hit person, things start to pick up real quick. Her character is really good at what she does. Actually, if they made a movie about her characters life and escapades, I would see and buy it in a heartbeat! The only character that did not impress me was that of Paz Vega, everyone else did a good job. There is humor, violence, torture, some nudity at the beginning. The plot is simple: call girl witnesses violent crime and steels the video hard drive as evidence of the crime. Very bad people want the hard drive back and the call girl dead. Three hit men ( or hit people ) are hired, not all at once, to get the call girl and hard drive. Along the way people are 'made' to talk and people die. Once things get rolling, it is hard to look away, and very enjoyable to the end.",1342569600,2,951,4.118279569892473
4504635,5,B004Z29W2Q,"Outstanding movie and cast! If you really want to spend couple of hours really away from the world and your problems, then you need to see this movie. A lots of unnecessary nudity at the beginning of the movie, but after that we are in for a treat. Paz Vega is OK but Janet Mc Teer is great in the role of the assassin. The scene where she has everybody for dinner in her home with her mom (don't tell mom I am smoking..., ya because this is the worst of you) is priceless. Just this scene together with the scene where she blows the head of her replacement is worth the money.

Nobody in this movie will win the Oscar, but it is a good solid entertainment with a predictable ending (...except for the marine!).

Easy five stars.",1342310400,3,729,4.237410071942446
4504636,4,B004Z29W2Q,"I do not recall ordering this product nor seeing the film, but if Amazon says I did, I must have.  It must have been a rip-roaring good time and I'm sure Ms. Vega turned in a stellar performance.  After reading the other reviews, I wish I remembered seeing it!",1342137600,3,260,4.285714285714286
4504637,4,B004Z29W2Q,"The cover art of Paz Vega in mini-dress and high heels wielding a machine gun surrounded by shell casings is somewhat misleading.  Granted the action of her high class call girl at an orgy for heavy hitters sets off a chain of events.  That said, as an actress Vega is pretty wooden and her character spends a bulk of the movie standing around or looking distressed.  Never mind because Janet McTeer as a former MI6 agent turned private contractor steals the film.  Part Helen Mirren and part Mary Poppins McTeer raises the energy level of ""Cat Run"" whenever she's on screen.  Ditto for Alphonso McCauley as an amateur detective.  His impersonation of a real Scotsman is worth the price of admission.  I also liked D.L. Hughley as the detectives' secretary with three missing limbs.  The story isn't anything special but director John Stockwell keeps the action moving and the laughs consistent.  If you're looking for a sleeper ""Cat Run"" is worth seeking.",1341360000,2,956,4.851851851851852

4504639,5,B004Z29W2Q,Very funny movie - mish mash of multiple genres into one fun ride!  Janet McTeer's performance is unforgettable.  Tony Curran plays a great villain; Paz Vega... well... she's a killer.  Scott & Alphonso make a very funny duo.,1340150400,6,225,4.868421052631579
4504640,2,B004Z29W2Q,"An Andorra-born prostitute (and single mother) gets involved in a government conspiracy to cover up a sadistic politician's murder. While a seasoned female assassin tracks down the girl holding the evidence of his crime, a pair of amateur private eyes embarks upon a mission to save her. On paper the story of the crime comedy ""Cat Run"" looks pretty good - especially when the hapless heroine is played by Paz Vega (""Sex and Lucia"" ""Spanglish""); in practice it is just another ineffective attempt Tarantino clone, of which characters are annoyingly one-dimensional, and violence pointless and nasty.

Alphonso McAuley and Scott Mechlowicz are Julian and Anthony, two bumbling private detective wannabes currently living in Montenegro. One of them is supposed to be comic relief while the other a wise and level-headed hero. With heavy-handed direction by John Stockwell, better known for ""Blue Crush"" ""Crazy/Beautiful"" and ""Into the Blue,"" they are either irritating or boring. Paz Vega as Catalina ""Cat"" Rona fares hardly better, with not much time to show her talent. Christopher McDonald appears as a corrupt politician Bill Krebb, one of the numerous roles he should have refused.

Their characters are all overshadowed by the scene-stealing turn from twice Oscar nominated Janet McTeer as a professional assassin Helen Bingham sporting elegant British English. She is a much crueler version of Helen Mirren's character in ""Red,"" chopping off a finger and other body parts of the poor guy she tortures. Only her character (and her suggested romance in the past) interests us, virtually dominating the final 20 minutes of the otherwise derivative crime comedy. By the time you get the climax, however, most probably you will have stopped caring.",1332633600,3,1748,5.284172661870503
