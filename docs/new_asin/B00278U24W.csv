8354235,1,B00278U24W,"Buy a bottle of cheap wine instead of wasting money on this awful offering. I've never heard of TGG Direct and I now see why. This trio of old school Black films looks like they all came from videotapes. Honestly, I only glanced at Brotherhood Of Death and Children Of The Night. I was very upset after seeing the horrible transfer of Candy Tangerine Man (the reason I bought this rip-off) which looks worse than a Ebay copy I purchased years ago. I was hoping I would finally get to see a remastered print of one of my favorite trashy Blaxsploitation films. This looks like it was copied off my copy. TGG may be short for Tommy Gordon's Grimy VHS Collection. Please, just stay away from this Urban CON-nection.",1279411200,,711,4.51937984496124
