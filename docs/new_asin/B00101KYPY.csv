8236516,5,B00101KYPY,"I studied with Jeff Herda, a student of Harvey Kurland, when I lived in Spokane.  I moved back to Ohio in 1999 but, unfortunately, this form is not taught back here.  This DVD is an excellent review of Section 1.  I wish there were similar DVD's for Sections 2/3 and 4/5 and 6.",1527206400,,277,4.188679245283019
8236517,5,B00101KYPY,Excellent DVD.  Very helpful for beginners studying this particular style of T'ai Chi.,1502841600,,86,5.615384615384615
8236518,5,B00101KYPY,"Kurland is one of the finest Tai Chi instructors I can think of.  A very holistic approach to the old art, and very calming.",1440979200,,124,4.166666666666667
8236519,4,B00101KYPY,"A good introduction to T'ai Chi with excellent warm up exercises. Could have been more side shots to demonstrate the balance of the performer. As the teacher states, the video should be used in conjunction with classes. Four stars.",1426809600,,231,4.948717948717949
8236520,5,B00101KYPY,This DVD is very helpful in daily practice at home to be sure I do the movements properly.  Having Mr. Kurland go through the steps on the screen helps me immensely.,1382918400,,165,4.32258064516129
8236521,5,B00101KYPY,"This DVD does not have fancy cool looking backgrounds and beautiful empty headed models demonstrating the form, however,
it does have quite likely the best Tai Chi Sifu - (instructor) in the USA demonstrating the form. If you want the real deal, this is the DVD to get.

I noticed that the other reviewer that gave it one star had a couple of problems. 1) he didn't like it's lack of Hollywood slickness, but he noticeably could not actually criticize the content of the form presented, and 2) his reviewer ranking was more than 15 million 800 thousand down the lists, showing that his reviews are not exactly highly rated themselves ! !

If you want good, get this one.",1375401600,5,670,4.575
8236522,4,B00101KYPY,This video provides really good explainations and demos of this style of tai chi.  I particularly liked the modifications for those of us with some limitations.  It gives a very good introduction to tai chi and this style in particular.,1375228800,4,236,4.875
8236523,5,B00101KYPY,"This is an excellent video by Sifu Harvey Kurland .His explaination of movements is very easy to follow, especially for new students. This form is exceptional in that the movements are taught using both sides of the body. There by the name symetrical. I am an assistant instructor with a class of 12 at my church. Every student has this video and most use it on a regular basis.

8236524,1,B00101KYPY,Very poor quality. It looks like it was a VHS-DUB of some over-aged unfit man doing T'ai-Chi in a gym.,1371859200,,102,4.15
8236525,5,B00101KYPY,Sifu Harvey Kurland is one of the best Tai Chi Chuan teachers and practicioners today. This video will help those who have attended a class and wish to refine their practice. The explanations and visual review of the exercises and movements will help anyone who has or is practicing Tai Chi Chuan.,1196640000,8,297,4.730769230769231
