8065151,5,B0009PX9BS,"This is a great video by Johnny Carson, true life places and real remembrances of his youth.  Included are home movies of his family in Nebraska.  This should be put on DVD.  Well done and gives an insight into the real Johnny Carson, who seems to be a hometown guy who made it big in Hollywood but surely preferred his privacy above notoriety.  Very enjoyable, a keeper.",1484006400,,371,4.492537313432836
