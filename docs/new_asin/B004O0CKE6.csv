How can people allow this to be done to any people group???  Wake up America!  Let's not stand by and allow this kind of behavior towards anyone, regardless of race, creed, color, religion...!  What happened to all that tolerance teaching we were hearing so much about???

8533146,5,B004O0CKE6,"Fiddler on the Roof (1971) is a film that depicts the struggle of a poor family, with restless children (daughters) who test their father's resolve with Jewish tradition. Chaim Topol (or simply Topol) stars in this musical classic as a rugged, stubborn but surprisingly compromising father who endures challenges to his faith, as well as his community. Topol gives one of the most brilliant performances in movie history; his acting ability cannot be overstated here. For those who aren't familiar with this classic movie, the fiddler on the roof in the movie is really just a symbolic figure, depicting the precariousness of a people at a volatile time in Czarist Russia. This movie has a fantastic setting, great aesthetic and detail, and such believable performances by all of the cast members. In the end, a father's heart (cautiously) is stronger than his tenacious ways. The special features are just okay, with commentary by the director (Norman Jewison) and Topol, who offer great perspective to this three hour movie. I highly recommend this early 70's masterpiece.",1436745600,11,1074,5.142857142857143
