It has  grown to be a village as these children grow up.  I've met one of the founders daughters, and two of the young adults that live there through the Blue Star of Hope, a non-profit that goes there annually to take donations and provide volunteer service work. This a very worthwhile organization to help in any way possible. Anyone wishing to volunteer there should contact Blue Star of Hope.",1404432000,,519,4.559139784946237

8240461,5,B00114UURM,"I first saw this film when I tok a high school geography class to see it...I have now purchased it directly from the producer Louise Hogarth. It is a superb film which tells an emotional story about how a wealthy white family gave up all their comforts to provide a home and an education for almost 600 orphaned children who have been impacted by HIV/AIDS. Everyone should see this film!!

I fell in love with these amazing children as well as with this family who left their affluent life in Johannasberg to devote their lives to these children.  I am recommending that we use this movie for a ""movie night"" at our church; I look forward to viewing it again.",1200182400,11,428,4.4743589743589745
