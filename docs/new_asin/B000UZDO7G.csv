2927322,5,B000UZDO7G,"My children adore this cartoon.  We first saw it in England while visiting friends.  I'm so excited it is coming to the U.S. now!!  Its very well done, computer animation,  involves the adventures of a little boy named Pocoyo (age 4)and his friends, Pato the duck and Ellie the Elephant.  Its all about friendship and discovery.  Even my 8 year old adores it but it is really age appropriate for 2-4 year olds.  I am very excited to show this cartoon to my preschoolers!  Its funny, entertaining while touching on core values of friendship.",1188000000,11,540,4.670212765957447

2927330,5,B000UZDO7G,"Pocoyo is awesome. I literally have five of them. I try to order one or two every two weeks. My son absolutely adores Pocoyo. We do not watch television because it is filled with all kinds of inappropriate things. However, Pocoyo is pure, fun, educational entertainment for our child that does not have any adult innuendos, inappropriate behavior, nor any suggestive language.  I would recommend this product for children age 6 months to 3 years.",1411257600,,446,4.946666666666666
2927331,5,B000UZDO7G,The Spanish audio feature rocks. My 2 and 1/2 year old daughter loves it. Would definitely recommend.,1407715200,,101,5.0

2927334,2,B000UZDO7G,I did not like both Pocoyo DVDs. I saw nothing that would hold my grand daughters interest or be of any benefit for her to watch. I hate the VOICE of the person narrating!! Why doesn't Pocoyo have his own voice?! This is ridiculous!,1395792000,,232,4.295454545454546
2927335,5,B000UZDO7G,We just love Pocoyo and Friends.  Wonderful lessons on friendship!  Easy to follow and fun for all ages! Yea for Pocoyo!,1388620800,,120,4.666666666666667

2927337,5,B000UZDO7G,My son is in love with this show and this DVD works perfectly to take along in the portable DVD player with us.  It keeps him entertained when needed and also helps calm him down at night when it's time to go to sleep!,1378166400,,218,3.9545454545454546
2927338,5,B000UZDO7G,so nice with a very good price my baby really enjoys pocoyo times this one contains a very good mix,1374969600,,99,4.0
2927339,4,B000UZDO7G,It's a little on the short side but for the price it was for it was a great add on gift for my daughter's birthday.,1374537600,,115,3.64
2927340,5,B000UZDO7G,"My daughter is in love with this cartoon.  It's simple, yet artistic.  My 19 month old is glued to the TV when we put this DVD in.  It's a personal favorite of this Daddy!!",1374364800,,172,4.0
2927341,5,B000UZDO7G,"I read great reviews about this but I was still surprised at how much my kids like these shows. My 3 year old (he might have even been under 3 when we got them) asked for these over and over. My 5 year old enjoys them, too, although not as often as his brother.

I recommend this for families with 2-4 year olds in particular.",1372809600,,326,4.015384615384615
2927342,5,B000UZDO7G,"So once again, thought it would be an excellent purchase to add to his collection, and also give him variety and decent viewing dvd's.",1372464000,,134,4.625

2927345,5,B000UZDO7G,"My toddler son has been addicted to Pocoyo since he was 3 months old.  I love it because it isn't annoying in the way that many other children's programs out there are.

By encoding the episodes to .MP4, we can also carry the episodes on our phones, tablet, and stream it over our private network. Whenever and wherever our boy gets fussy, Pocoyo helps cool him down. I own all the discs and wish there were more episodes available.",1360886400,,432,4.455696202531645
2927346,5,B000UZDO7G,My son loves Pocoyo! I like the style of the cartoon itself. He already has a previous dvd that he also watches on replay!,1358380800,,122,4.125
2927347,5,B000UZDO7G,Adorable. My Grandson is 3 and loves Pocoyo. He watches it over and over again. A big hit with his 1 year old brother too!,1358121600,,122,3.92
2927348,5,B000UZDO7G,Great video for the little ones to play with along with mario actions figures purchased previously.  The kids now play the video in the car on long  trips. Thanks for getting us to this quickly for the summer trips.,1356307200,,215,4.487179487179487
2927349,5,B000UZDO7G,This is the cutest video! Make sure you order the English version. It will keep toddlers entertained! Lots of bright colors and cute animation,1355356800,,142,4.958333333333333
2927350,5,B000UZDO7G,"My son loves pocoyo. The price was great, quick shipping. Educational video for toddlers. Worth the money. Your child will be a huge fan.",1355097600,,137,4.75
2927351,5,B000UZDO7G,"ok so i don;t really know what the fascination with Pocoyo is, but my kids love it. This dvd is great and would recommend it for anyone whos little ones love Pocoyo.",1354492800,,165,4.1875
2927352,5,B000UZDO7G,"If you've read my review for ""Meet Pocoyo"", you know how much our family loves it. Same can be said here; I can't say it's better, but I can say it's nice to have another one in the series.",1351814400,,189,3.871794871794872
2927353,5,B000UZDO7G,"My 2 yr old loves Pocoyo!!! Since Nick jr has been playing some odd stuff lately I decided to try out this dvd for her, she literally will watch this over and over! I just bought the the 3 pack dvd set for her, THIS IS A MUST HAVE for any child who loves pocoyo it has 7 fun episodes and unlike some on tv he actually talks more!",1340409600,,329,3.782608695652174
2927354,5,B000UZDO7G,"These cartoons are so cute and my dauguter loves them.  I love that they are short, with about 7, or 8 episodes per DVD, so I can allow her to watch a few episoded without her sitting in fornt of the TV for hours!",1317081600,,213,3.840909090909091
2927355,4,B000UZDO7G,"I have introduced Pocoyo from Youtube to my baby when he was around 5 months old. Now that he is going 15 months in June 30, 2011, he could watch and understand cartoons much better, all he's ever wanted is Pocoyo. Nothing seems to get his interests much, except Pocoyo. He can sit and watch Pocoyo the entire dvd in contrast to Mickey Mouse dvd. Good investment when parents like me get to take a quick break.",1309046400,,410,4.337662337662338
2927356,5,B000UZDO7G,"The show is absolutely wonderful. The stories entertaining and very imaginative. What I love is how amazing the animation is and how non-verbally expressive each character is. There is also a deliberate sparseness to the background visuals, allowing the child to focus just on the characters.",1297036800,,292,5.369565217391305
2927357,5,B000UZDO7G,"The whole family LOVES Pocoyo! Our 18 month old calls him Kai. (who knows, doesn't matter, he grabs his Pocoyo doll and says Kai) He will watch each DVD repeatedly. Pocoyo is gentle, but fun, not over-stimulating but not boring either. Buy all 4 that way you won't bored with one. (trust me your child won't be bored with just one, but you will be!)",1296345600,,349,4.384615384615385
2927358,5,B000UZDO7G,Our Granddaughter really loves Pocoyo so we bought this DVD for her for Christmas..She is really enjoying this..She can sit for hours and watch it..Good teaching tool for young children..,1295049600,2,187,5.266666666666667
2927359,5,B000UZDO7G,"Its so hard to find TV for a 2-year old that is not too flashy, loud, etc.  My wife and I monitor our son's TV viewing carefully after reading many articles regarding its affect on toddler's attention spans.  Pocoyo is funny and entertaining without being obnoxious and without being too ""flashy"".  Shows that are all ""zoom, pan, move around, shout"" are not good for toddlers.  Shows that are TOO quiet are boring and do not entertain them.  Pocoyo is a great example of a show that gets it right.",1285804800,4,497,4.53932584269663
2927360,5,B000UZDO7G,"Not much to say here: the powers that be addicted my child to this show, and my wife ""suggested"" that I pick up some DVDs for him. This was the second one, and to my relief he went ballistic when the DVDs arrived. He loves the show, won't shut up about it, and it is nowhere as annoying as the crap he watches on Youtube so it's a win all around.",1281398400,,346,3.887323943661972
2927361,5,B000UZDO7G,"We received this DVD for Christmas when our twins were 11.5 months old. We would put it on occasionally and they seemed mildly interested, but weren't really that into TV/DVDs yet at that age other than Baby Einstein. Our boys just recently (at 18 months) started saying ""Pocoyo!"" and now that they can say it, I realize how much they love it; they ask for ""Pocoyo!"" all the time! This series is VERY charming, simple, and seems to be good for language development. Love the British accents, too. :)",1280793600,,499,4.617977528089888
2927362,5,B000UZDO7G,Our grandchildren loved this dvd.  It's a cute show for the younger children 2-6.,1273276800,,81,4.785714285714286
2927363,5,B000UZDO7G,"This show is colorful and easy to follow for small children. The lessons are simple and an example of good values which is rare these days on television with all of the mindless, worthless cartoons out there. My son loves it and laughs with the characters, I feel good because he is also getting a good lesson! I have recommended this to all of my friends with young children.",1271894400,,376,4.463768115942029
2927364,5,B000UZDO7G,Our son really likes this one.  We aren't sick of it yet either :),1269734400,,66,3.7142857142857144
2927365,5,B000UZDO7G,"I ordered three Pocoyo DVD's for my two year old grandson for his birthday.  All my grandkids - from 18 months to 11 years - LOVED them.  The music is lively, the drawing is very clever and the DVD's are full of teachable moments.  They invite interaction from the kids too.  I haven't been able to find these anywhere in the stores.  I'm sure I'll order more.",1269216000,,360,4.313432835820896
2927366,3,B000UZDO7G,"My son loves Pocoyo; however, due to his speech delay, his therapist suggested he only watch tv programs in Spanish.  I bought this DVD hoping it included Spanish language but it didn't.  Other than that, Pocoyo is awesome!",1224201600,,223,4.842105263157895
2927367,5,B000UZDO7G,"Pocoyo is the most fantastic visual and learning environmnent for young children under 1 year old. It has a white background with very bright colour characters and good patterns of behaviour and language learning.

It revolves around the baby Pocoyo, (Ms) Elly the pink Elephant, Loula the Dog, the always-cool Pato the duck, and sleepy bird.

The hallmark of any good children's product is being able to appeal to the adults. This is amusing enough that you will enjoy watching it with your child, even the 10th time. Enjoy!

But get the English series one disc instead - its 91 minutes and better value for money.",1217376000,10,615,4.783018867924528
2927368,5,B000UZDO7G,It was an excellent investment since my kid learns from Pocoyo and these cartoons are educational and cute as well.,1212451200,,115,4.8
2927369,5,B000UZDO7G,I love Pocoyo's freind Elly my son loves the duck - we both LOVE the show!,1205366400,,74,3.6875
2927370,5,B000UZDO7G,"This show is adorable!
I bought this show on a whim for my preschooler, and I am so glad I did!
It's so darned cute, FUNNY, educational, and I think I love it as much as the kids do.
Try Hopla if you like this- that's another new one we tried.  We like Hopla too!
I highly recommend Pocoyo!",1199664000,,290,3.9152542372881354
2927371,2,B000UZDO7G,I like Pocoyo a lot.  It's a great show.  The reason I'm giving this dvd only 2 stars is because it's squashed.  The show is broadcast at 4:3 but for some reason the people who put this dvd out squished it down to make it widescreen.  The characters aren't as appealing when they are squashed.  Let the buyer beware.,1197158400,10,316,4.288135593220339
2927372,5,B000UZDO7G,"I am English, living the US with a 3 year old son.  We go back to the UK every 6 months and the first thing my son asks for is Pocoyo.
The animation is great - plain backgrounds (at least in the first 2 series) which allows you to concentrate on the characters.  Wonderful expressions and music and simple ideas about sharing, caring, being careful and being friends.
I am ECSTATIC that this is finally available in the US.
The thing that most appealed to me as a parent was 1) the shows are short, about 10-12 minutes 2) right now, the product is not commercialized (although that will probably change soon enough) 3) the ideas are simple yet convey quite a range of emotion - for example my son can understand that Pocoyo is sorry when he breaks his sister's toy.
If your child is watching TV, I would say this is a great addition.  And you'll enjoy it too!",1193097600,,859,4.3229813664596275

8215792,5,B000UZDO7G,"This came in good time, in perfect condition, for a fair price, and pleased both our children and their toddler.  We were happy to give this kind of quality to our babies.  DECENT is not always easy to come by - and as a former teacher, I am glad to have something sweet and lovely like POCOYO and his friends.",1501891200,,310,4.15
8215793,5,B000UZDO7G,"Oh my word this video is so cute! It's so colorful, clean and such fun for the kids. They enjoy it and sometimes we sit down and watch it too as a family. :)",1484956800,,157,3.6470588235294117
8215794,5,B000UZDO7G,Love love love my son really enjoys this show he's 2 years old and honestly I feel that the show is helping him talk a little more he repeats things off the show already says all the characters  names. I recommend it for toddler age kids,1474675200,,237,4.1521739130434785
