4229329,5,B003YI68K6,"We just got back from our trip to the Great Southwest yesterday, and we wanted to watch something that would help us capture the memories of our trip. This movie did it well, and told the story of the entire Colorado watershed that formed the Grand Canyon and many other spectacular parks. The photography was great.",1401062400,,316,4.660714285714286

4229331,5,B003YI68K6,"Very beautiful video. Used it to show 5th graders how erosion formed such a beautiful place.

4229332,5,B003YI68K6,"I've been many places,  3 gorges dam in china on the yangze,  tibet, egypt, new zealand, australia, but only to the south rim once as a teenager.  This video solidifies my next venture along with the belief there's no place like home",1390867200,,233,4.5
4229333,5,B003YI68K6,This video is defininitely a must see. The feel is as though you are flying over the area that leads to the Grand Canyon and the Canyon itself. It is visually stunning. Don't miss the chance to see such an amazing film.,1390867200,,219,4.238095238095238
4229334,5,B003YI68K6,"An incredible journey through the entire grand canyon system of national parks. I never knew all this existed and certainly much of it is inaccessible to most of us in person. Very well done and breathtakingly, beautiful scenery with great music accompaniment and narration.",1389139200,,274,5.25
4229335,4,B003YI68K6,This aerial view of the Grand Canyon brought back many memories of a years ago float trip through the Grand Canyon.  Many of the sites viewed from the air were sites that we had seen from the river level so many years ago.  We enjoyed remembering the spectacular views and the unique perspective of seeing the sites from the air.,1372982400,,329,4.466666666666667
4229336,4,B003YI68K6,My son and I enjoyed watching this show on my kindle. The scenery was beautiful and the narrative was interesting. Can't wait to visit the Grand Canyon in person!,1372204800,,162,4.620689655172414
4229337,5,B003YI68K6,"I have been collecting this type of content for years.  I orginally started with DVDs, but with the advent of Blu-ray have switched over to this format.  I have noticed that content that was filmed years back and originally released in the DVD format, but then re-released on Blu-ray, just doesn't seem to work out.  Often, I notice crystal clear images in the middle of a high-def screen, but the image blurs out near the edges.  If you're going to go with Blu-ray, one would expect the best in picture quality.  And this is where Wings Over Grand Canyon delivers the goods better than anything I've ever seen.  But beyond the astonishing clarity of the images, the actual cinematography is simply magnificent!  There is absolutely ZERO camera shake in the footage, and the shots themselves are beautifully composed.  But the true show-stopper is the saturation of the colors.  The colors are simply beautiful.  Also of note is that this film does not just photograph the Grand Canyon, but also provides glorious aerial adventures into Canyonlands NP, Arches NP, and Bryce Canyon NP.  Truly a magestic piece of work.  And don't let the price tag scare you off.  You will truly get what you pay for in this case.",1285891200,16,1212,4.769230769230769

8409319,3,B003YI68K6,"Great photography.  But many of the prospective viewers of this video will be retired.  They will need subtitles.  No $25 BD movie without subtitles gets more than 3 stars.  Period.

ETA: I have been through most of these Parks and this video treats them well.",1467504000,,260,4.688888888888889

8409321,3,B003YI68K6,"There are some beautiful images and the presentation is somewhat clear, but the music and script and so forth are cheesy and over-dramatic. At times random quotes appear on the screen, and you're not sure why. Don't watch this to gain history or comprehensive information, but for a basic introduction and the photography. All the same, it is beneficial for getting some imagery for the region. We watched it after returning from this region, and it helped give a bigger context for Grand Canyon and the surrounding region.",1461024000,,523,4.954545454545454
