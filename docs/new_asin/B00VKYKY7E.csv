7093728,1,B00VKYKY7E,"The design is a great concept.  The execution is terrible.  The case does not have sleeves to protect the discs, they are all stacked.  In between the discs are very thin foam ""discs"" to separate them.  Nothing protects the top or bottom disc from the case.  Your discs will likely be damaged, as this box-set essentially has no way to protect the discs from being destroyed.

Fast and Furious... you, the customer, signing onto amazon to get a refund after receiving damaged product due to it being poorly designed.",1488326400,4,516,4.741573033707865

7093733,1,B00VKYKY7E,None of these play in any of the 3 DVD players that we own. Very disappointed as I purchased for my nephew for a gift and when given to him the return date had already passed. $50 down the drain. Not happy.,1487030400,,206,3.9285714285714284

7093745,5,B00VKYKY7E,"I am really happy with this set.  I watched all of the movies within a couple weeks of receiving the set.  They're all stacked on top of each other rather than each having their own sleeve, but as long as you're careful when handling them, it works just fine.  It's nice that it comes with the digital copes too, which includes an iTunes download if that's what you want.  If I remember correctly, the last three were the extended edition.",1485302400,,439,4.45

I justified this purchase by telling myself that I just wanted the Paul Walker, RIP, collection.

I can just buy the new movies as they come out and just slip them in there without the jewel cases!",1484697600,,393,4.324324324324325

7093769,1,B00VKYKY7E,This collection is complete trash! The quality is terrible and it says that there are English Spanish and Francis subtitles on the box but this is not the case. It looks like VHS quality transfered to DVD and don't get me started on the audio. These are not in 5.1 surround!

I love to see it sitting on our TV stand. If you are looking to buy a boxed set of the series, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this collection.

We watched one move per night for a week and it was very enjoyable. The story lines were better than I expected and of course, the cars were a lot of fun. While the case is interesting it does not fit into standardized storage systems. The disks are just stacked on a spindle so every time we watched a move we had to remove the stack and put the most recently watched movie on the bottom, eventually rotating through the entire set. This will eventually cause the disks to scratch and so it is a set that I would never loan out. Otherwise, this is a great set. I'm glad I bought it.",1474329600,3,715,4.078014184397163

It makes a good conversation piece when friends come over and they're looking for a movie to watch in my collection.  There aren't a lot of movies I still buy hard copies of but this was one of them.  When I saw this collection series I just had to have it!  The wheel case twists off in halves and the movies are stacked on a rod in the center.  So you do have to pull them all off if you want the one on the bottom of the stack.  There are protector sheets in between each disc as not to scratch one another.  I would recommend this as a great gift idea for a Fast & Furious super fan or someone who hasn't picked up all the movies!  It's just a lot of fun in the wheel case!

Yes the case is cool and actually really well made, but having all the movies together in one collection was just the ultimate price for me. In this collection you get the choice of it on your Blu-Ray player or it also comes with Digital HD with UltraViolet. This collection will give you hours and hours of entertainment.

7093870,3,B00VKYKY7E,"The movies, your either a fan or your not. This review are about the disk. The first disk looks like box shavings where all over the top. After cleaning, it wasn't debris it was deep scratches. I looked at the lid it had deep scratches to. They come with a sheet between each disc except the top and bottom, why? At minimum the top should have a spacer (like disk stacks) and a sheet for top and bottom. Even with sheets the other discs had lesser scratches. Luckily so far most the discs have played. The manufacture needs to rethink the packaging.

Product wise they did a good job converting the movies. Picture is clear, sound roars when it needs to, plenty of extras per disc.
Tip: watch Tokyo Drift after Fast & Furious 6 not third where it is located.",1471824000,,758,4.375886524822695
7093871,3,B00VKYKY7E,I was a little disappointed with the lack of protection on the inside for the disks.  My Fast & Furious 1 disc has some scratches on the top of it because it had rubbed on the case. Besides that it's a cool collectible.,1471737600,,219,4.093023255813954

Only room for all 7 movies, so I gave it 3 stars for this reason alone. Being a gift I had hoped to have all the movies but now I'll just have to get 7 separately. I wish it could have been all the movies but I'm sure it was just a simple mistake.",1470009600,,357,3.710526315789474

7093910,4,B00VKYKY7E,Been looking to get something like this sense my wife had never seen most of the movies so when there was a sale on prime day I jumped on it. The case is actually just the wheel part and it opens up and all the discs are just stacked in there with foam in-between so I wasn't very thrilled about that but hopefully we don't have a problem with scratching and loosing them and what not.,1469577600,,385,4.078947368421052
7093911,4,B00VKYKY7E,"I am a fan of the Fast & Furious franchise. I think the movies really hit their stride when Dwayne Johnson's character was introduced in the fifth movie.
I only gave it 4 stars because of the case, which is just a spindle with the discs stacked on top of each other. After reading the reviews about the case, I should have bought the collection with individual cases.",1469491200,,367,4.411764705882353

7093913,5,B00VKYKY7E,I purchased this on amazon prime day. It was a gift for my boyfriend.  This set is an awesome deal. It's in Blu ray and comes with bonus features. The packaging was in perfect condition. They are stacked inside the tire worth protective foam sheets in between each disc.  My boyfriend loved this gift.,1469404800,,301,4.555555555555555

7093918,1,B00VKYKY7E,"Was extremely excited to recieve this product and upon initial opening was pleased with the packaging. I decided to look through the discs and realized something wasn't right. Instead of receiving all 7 movies, I received 1-6 with an extra copy of Fast 5 and in place of disc 7 is this nice little piece of paper that states that there is a space reserved for the disc should I add it at a later time. Not sure if it is just a prime day issue but be aware it may not be as advertised.",1469059200,3,484,4.105263157894737
7093919,4,B00VKYKY7E,"This is awesome! I have loved these movies ever since the very first one came out. It's great to finally have all of the movies and that they're all on blu-ray.

7093921,5,B00VKYKY7E,I love the movies with the original crew - films 1 and 4 thru 7.  They are excellent.  Haven't watched films 2 or 3 yet.,1468972800,,120,3.76

7093926,4,B00VKYKY7E,"I love the movies, it's just a guilty pleasure for me, obviously not realistic in many ways.

It loses a star for the packaging.  I get the whole throwing racing movies into a little plastic and rubber tire thing but it's done poorly.
upon opening there is a thin plastic spindle in the middle with all the movies stacked on it with a thin foam piece between each disk with the exception of the bottom one which luckily was just the extra DVD because it was scratched up from the spindle. Either be careful not to lose those foam pieces or buy different cases if you don't want these getting scratched up over time.",1468886400,,615,4.385964912280702
7093927,4,B00VKYKY7E,"Excellent movies, but I have to agree with some other reviews in that the packaging leaves something to be desired.  Top disk scratched on top because it wasn't protected from the plastic case.  A bit of a pain to get discs in and out of.  Foam separaters left residue on each disc playing surface so all had to be cleaned prior to use.",1468886400,,336,4.301587301587301
7093928,4,B00VKYKY7E,Amazing collection of movies but more thought could have went into the design of the case like acually have seperate holders for each disc instead of stacked on top of one another and divided by foam that youll most likely lose the first time around watching them.,1468886400,,264,4.638297872340425

7093931,5,B00VKYKY7E,"Great collection for anyone who loves F&F and doesn't have a BluRay player.  Snagged it while it was on sale for PrimeDay, but even at full retail, it's worth the price.",1468800000,,169,4.451612903225806

7093934,5,B00VKYKY7E,I bought this for my husband during Prime Day and got a great deal on it. It's pretty cool that the discs are stored in a tire case! My husband can't wait to binge watch the whole franchise.,1468713600,,190,4.026315789473684
7093935,5,B00VKYKY7E,"Not a huge fan of all the movies, but the first brings back memories to me, and I haven't seen the big chunk of movies in the middle. So at this price, it's good for people like me, and for diehard, it's also a good point to get all the movies you love neatly together on next gen/hi def collection with extras on each movie. The case (tire) is the selling point for me, even has a rubber feel around the tire, it turns and both halves come off with all 7 discs neatly stacked. All blu rays are in DTS HD MA also, which sound amazing on any 5.1/7.1/ or atmos upmixing theater.",1468627200,,576,4.06140350877193
7093936,5,B00VKYKY7E,Love the movies but love the packaging even more. It's real rubber just like a real tire. It is a little hard to get the very last disc out but the cool factor is just to great to not have.,1468627200,,189,3.75
7093937,1,B00VKYKY7E,"Next time they want to make a fancy gimmick, put more thought into the contents than a piece of felt between each disc, what a damn mess, very cheap and unprofessional. Fortunately, I bought this item on Prime Day '16 for $35, had I paid almost $80 for such cheap packaging, I would be more angry and probably issued a return.",1468627200,5,326,4.360655737704918

7093939,3,B00VKYKY7E,"I'm torn - on one hand, the front of the first disc and the back of the last disc (bonus disc) came scratched up, due to lack of padding in those areas (the rest of the discs have padding between them), but on the other hand, the tire the discs come in (rubber/plastic) is fantastic and ridiculous and amazing. Since I'm likely going to be watching the digital versions anyway, the scuffed discs don't bug me much, but something for buyers to be aware of.

To add insult to injury, there's an offer for an additional free movie of your choice included that expired in 2015.",1468540800,,573,4.40566037735849
7093940,2,B00VKYKY7E,Only first 6 movies included. Zavvi.com has the whole set for 25 dollars.  Not a very good value,1468540800,,96,4.333333333333333
7093941,5,B00VKYKY7E,I call this the PW set. I've been a fan since the first movie came out and wanted something special to keep the F&F movies with Paul Walker in. I got this on prime day for super cheap and do not regret it at all. Movies 1-7 and a bonus disc are included along with the case.,1468540800,,274,3.824561403508772
7093942,3,B00VKYKY7E,The discs are not individually packaged they're all stacked one Atop The Other and they are all scratched from vibrations or shipping presumably furthermore the thank you for purchasing Furious 7 free movie gift and digital HD code both expired on 12/31/15 so I paid extra money for that feature for nothing and received scratched discs on top of it,1468540800,,349,4.833333333333333

7093944,1,B00VKYKY7E,I was absolutely ecstatic to see the Fast and Furious collection on Prime day! I think I bought it at around 6:00am. So one may imagine my utter disappointment when I popped the first movie in to enjoy and the disc was so scratched up that several chapters won't even play. I looked at the other discs and saw the same issue. I would attribute this flaw in the product to the fact that each disc is only separated by a thin piece of foam and all the discs come stacked together in a low quality case (meant to resemble a tire). I will likely send back unless I can get a replacement in the hopes that the case I got just happened to be defective.,1468454400,2,646,4.134920634920635
7093945,1,B00VKYKY7E,"I was so excited for my 1-7 collection to come. Then tonight when it came I was looking through it and realized for the 7th movie it has a piece of paper saying ""future spot for furious 7"". I'm so pissed it was suppose to include it!",1468454400,,233,3.978723404255319
7093946,4,B00VKYKY7E,"The movies are good and the tire is so cool. For the cost and limited edition how this comes without the digital versions is horrible. I was looking at the different box sets and went with this one, so it is my fault for missing that in the description. It should be a given with a set like this. There is a deal for a free digital download, but that has expired. It was a great deal with Prime Day, but wouldn't pay for this at regular prices. The package is great but certainly not worth that much. Buy the sets with the movies and download.",1468454400,,543,4.132075471698113

7093996,5,B00VKYKY7E,I waited to buy this specific collection because I see it as the Paul Walker complete collection.  Just in case the F&F is never the same I want to preserve its memory in the highest quality possible.  The itunes downloads and ultraviolet streaming that come with this package worked perfectly for me.,1452816000,,301,4.769230769230769
7093997,5,B00VKYKY7E,"This is an incredible package.  I received iTunes copies of every movie, Ultraviolet copies of every movie, AND the Blu-Ray versions.  For the price of what it would cost just to get the digital movies from Apple... this offers 3x the value.

I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I immediately redeemed the Ultraviolet and iTunes codes and had my movie playing from my phone on my TV with Chromecast in minutes.  In the time it took to download all of the iTunes movies, I had already finished watching one via Ultraviolet (specifically, with the Flixster Video app).  If I ever have the opportunity to use a friend's home theater system, we'll be using the Blu-Ray discs with an HD TV and surround sound.

Such an epic movie series.  And the case is pretty awesome, too.  It has enough room for me to add future discs for any new FF movies (I see on Flixster that the 8th movie will be coming out in a couple of years!).",1452384000,,918,4.4226190476190474

7094020,3,B00VKYKY7E,"My husband was so happy to get this boxed set at a nice price. The problem is that the DVDs are all stacked in the wheel-shaped case with just a piece of removable plastic between each one to keep them from getting scratches. No sleeves or anything to protect them. It's a cute idea, but the DVDS are not going to hold up well over time unless we are extremely careful with them. It probably would have been wiser to buy them separately.",1448928000,4,437,4.27710843373494

I also returned the replacement for another $6.35 but wasn't reimbursed anything. I then ordered the single F&F 7 & had to return it! I still haven't seen it. Manufacturing problem!

7094055,2,B00VKYKY7E,The movies are of course great but I don't like how they packaged this product. First off it is what it looks like a wheel but inside all the discs are on top of one another with only a piece of foam in between them. It is very hard to get to the disc you want with out having to pull all of them out and start looking for the one you want.,1447027200,,340,3.671232876712329

7094058,5,B00VKYKY7E,"Can't go wrong with F&F. Great tire case to keep them stored in, they are stacked on top of each other with only a thin piece of foam until you get to the last disc. There is nothing between the last disc and the bottom of case so when I got the set the bottom disc was totally scratched on the playable/readable side. I was able to polish it up and it plays fine but I would suggest that when these are packed to put another piece of the foam directly on the bottom to avoid this, otherwise, great set!",1446854400,11,503,4.04

7094076,5,B00VKYKY7E,"This is an amazing collection in cute packaging. Jammed packed with lots of action. I wished I would have waited on purchasing my bluray movies. I bought my movies individually as each installment released. From what I have seen in the packaging the disc are on a spindle. What's cool about this package is it includes all 7 digital copies (ultraviolet) so if you have an account to redeem the codes and you have your tv and bluray device connected to your account you don't have to worry about dragging out your movies and getting fingerprints on the discs. Just log into your account and select which fast and furious you want to watch. It may be worth it to repurchase just for the codes since my collection did not originally come with codes and regift the discs. I would like to have a digital copy for my collection along with part 7. I still have not purchased part 7. Great buy. Just thought I would point out great packaging, great price, amazing action movies. They thought of everything a collector would want.",1446076800,,1021,4.584699453551913

7094081,5,B00VKYKY7E,"I got this today. I love how it was packaged and all.  It is an awesome collectors set for sure.
After opening it up I found out that NOT ALL the movies were "" Unrated"" as it is advertised. the only movies that are Unrated are the Extended Versions of 5,6 and 7.  the others are PG13.  I thought I was getting All the movies Unrated but that is ok.
 I finally opened up the set and first thing I noticed was the disk of the first movie had scratches, etc on the front of the disk. I have attached a picture of what the disk looks like The rest of the disks had a felt type material between the rest of them for protection.
 The way the disks were packaged and all is nice. Looks like a Tire and Wheel. You twist it to open it up then you have the insert that actually holds all the movies on a flimsy, bendable plastic tray.  You have the 7 movies plus a Bonus Disk.

Outstanding picture quality and enhanced high def sound make it a repeat viewing time and time again. The sequence may seem off in the order the movies are presented initially, but in a way it adds to the mix of the storylines. Also the clever packaging of all seven disks within a wheel give it an added nice touch in par with theme of the movies.

This  two thing disappointment that case is not very strong when I test if i could force crack case it would break and other thing is from the case open by seen on first dvd is Fast and Furious 1 was scratch  similar on other reviewer complaining about it. it should have protective film layers like it already had layers each from 1 to 7 discs.  But overall is 4.5 but give 5 stars anyways because of design collection case.,1445212800,,579,4.245454545454545

He once told me he wanted to own EVERY ONE of the Fast movies. After 7 came out I saw this set and didn't think twice about gettting it. It is a real rubber tire case. The rim is chrome plastic. But it is very durable. The case opens up in half. It contains all of the movies on the same rod. Nothing else fancy inside. Just the tire and the movies. We are happy. It is very cool!

Disc three, Tokyo Drift, chronologically should be sandwiched between Furious 6 and & 7 .

There are little foam inserts that separate and protect your discs. Just be careful with them and don't rub your slimy fingers all over them like a 5 year old, and you'll be fine.

Of course I have to pay my respects: Paul Walker, You will truly be missed. These movies inspired an entire generation of new car enthusiasts. Thank you for everything!",1443657600,106,689,4.425196850393701

 The audio was great. The sound effects from the front, surrounds, and rears were great. The voice dialogue was clear and you can hear even the slighest whisper. If this is any indication of how the audio in this set everyone should be quite pleased.

So I was looking to buy 7 on Blu ray and found this and I said heck yea why pay 20 bucks for 7 when I could have them all for 60 bucks. Dom is one of my favorite characters, right up there with Indiana Jones, John Mclane, and Martin Riggs! I got my love of history from Indy, my love of guns from Mclane, and Riggs. But my love of fast awesome american cars comes from Dom. Sorry Vin Diesel my love of family comes naturally. Hats off to the actors who make these movies awesome, and to the mechanics that build these awesome cars. To the haters of these movies keep driving your prius to work in your cubical, i'll drive my Hemi to work and build america! P.S. don't think you will ever see a prius in these movies.",1442102400,,830,4.006024096385542

7094186,2,B00VKYKY7E,"I have just finished watching the first 6 of these Fast and Furious films, and I just gotta say..... maybe it's not such a good idea to watch two or more of these movies in a row because they are all ""over the top"" ridiculous with their high speed driving through what should be heavily populated areas (and nobody gets hit) and their crazy moves and action scenes, in general.

And what's more, there is so much ""negative vibe"" in all the interaction with each other, and also, just awful ""bad attitude"" music. The girls are pretty, but all the people in these films are all generally just plain ""unlikable"" as a whole.

It was way too overwhelming for me and in the long run, they are all pretty dumb.  A lot of action, and not much story. Well, wait a minute..the one with Eva Mendes wasn't too bad. But, my having the earlier box set of the first six is truly tiresome to ever think I'd ever watch any of them again so I guess I'm going to sell it and I don't think I'd even bother seeing Number Seven. I'm sure it will be ""over the top"" ridiculous too.

Maybe these films are meant for kids, because they are pretty silly....",1440460800,3,1130,4.291079812206573
