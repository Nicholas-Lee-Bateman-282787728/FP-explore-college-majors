For instance, take The Carpathian Eagle-I mean this bird rips your heart out (and I ain't talking `bout Barry Manilow!).
Ya see, there's this legend `bout this Polish Princess who tore out her lover's hearts that inspires this freaked-out killer to do the same. Like...I sure wouldn't want to be on the clean-up detail-the cost of  Dutch Cleanser alone would be terrifying! Anyway darlings, try not to lose your heart over this one...unpleasant dreams.",1291939200,,611,5.0495049504950495
8169393,5,B000MIY1G4,"I'll admit. I usually hate movies that have surprise endings. This one not only do I not hate, I absolutely love it. This isn't some lame Jason or Freddy Horror hack and slash movie. In fact the whole movie is only 1 hour long. Its one of those old fashion (Well old fashion for me. I was born in 1975), that you could rent a whole bunch of and have a decent fright night movie marathon without worrying about nightmares. Or only have the time to see 2 or 3 normal present day movies before having to hit the hay. I wish the people would put a DVD version of this out. My poor old copy is ready to fall apart and I hate that! Definitely get this movie, a case of popcorn, invite a bunch of freinds over and have a screaming good time.",1255564800,,734,4.068965517241379
