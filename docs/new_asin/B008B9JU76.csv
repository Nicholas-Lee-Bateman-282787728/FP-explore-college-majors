5146075,5,B008B9JU76,"It's true that I love Asylum Blackout, but it's not without several very noticeable faults.  I'm sure I'm forgetting several in my review.  For one, it takes forever for the movie to get going and once it *does* get going, it feels like it ends way too soon.  Also, the employees that work at the asylum are suspiciously unarmed and defenseless for some bizarre reason, which doesn't make sense given the psychotic nature of the inmates.  This also doesn't make sense since the guys that work there are more like clueless punks only there to cook meals for the inmates, at least, that's the initial impression.  This makes you think it's not necessary to really care about their fate when the time comes (and trust me, you know it's coming- it's only a matter of when).

I mean *every single one* of the dangerous criminals are completely psychotic and beyond the point of being unreasonable, so they obviously have nothing to lose.  Under these conditions, you'd need the best kind of protection available to assure your safety but... apparently not in this asylum.  Strange.

Obviously the inmates were made so psychotic for the purpose of delivering a suspense/horror movie.  Regardless of these issues, the final 30 minutes is pretty darn entertaining.  This is when the employees basically spend their time tucking and hiding under tables and inside storage rooms, and anywhere they can just to escape the army of crazy criminals released after a blackout locks everyone inside.  These bad boys are motivated to destroy as much of the asylum as possible... and that's another flaw.  Wouldn't you want to capture and kill the employees if you're an asylum?  After all, you'd want to get rid of anything that could possibly stand in the way of your persuit of escaping.  Then again maybe the inmates intention was never to escape after all and just go crazy on everything around them?

I have to ask, who in their right mind would EVER create an asylum under these conditions?  The electric goes out, all criminals are released?  It's hilarious to think such a scenario is possible. Also, the segments involving a phone hitting the head of one of the main characters and still working perfectly fine... and later the phone call to the cops where the cop for whatever reason doesn't seem interested or lacks the proper attention span to understand a man CLEARLY and desperately explaining the emergency situation over the phone... a typical trait of horror movies is to be totally clueless and lack logic on the part of the helpful folks, of course.  Can't have the good guys making an easy escape can we?  These are all flaws that should have been changed before the movies release in my opinion.

However I still firmly stand behind my 5-star rating.  The final 30 minutes drastically picks up concerning the entertainment level as violent deaths occur one after another, along with people getting burned, tortured, stabbed and even decapitated.  All wonderful additions to a horror movie and totally appropriate for a movie about inmates escaping and running wild.  The atmosphere is decent towards the end too, especially when the employees run for their lives only to reach a dead end on a couple occasions.  A feeling of dread and concern for their safety occurs for you the viewer, which is a beautiful piece of writing and even looks frightening on TV.

Great movie, regardless of the weak low budget acting and the hit or miss storytelling that takes a while to get underway.  Also regardless of that one song that plays a couple times (most notable during the credits) that sounds like it's copying the mid 70's period of the Kinks directly (and I KNOW it's ripping off another 70's song too- if only I could figure out which one, hmmm).  I highly recommend this movie, but don't expect anything greater than typical Hollywood exaggerated suspense.  Do NOT expect a bunch of logical situations either.",1383782400,,3913,4.850903614457831
5146076,3,B008B9JU76,Story was interesting and original. Intense and at times horrifying. But the actors were unbelievable and annoying. Recommend checking out.,1379462400,,139,6.0
5146077,4,B008B9JU76,"I don't buy a movie unless i really enjoyed watching it and want to add it to my collection. So me purchasing the movie answers the question; is this movie any good?
- I like the plot, it makes sense and it's a great concept; what happens if your stuck in an asylum and the power goes out?
- My only negative critique would be that ****(SPOILER ALERT)**** the main character goes crazy at the end, so your kind of left to assume he made it out safely and eventually recovered.

-Great movie to add to your collection, i've watched this movie at least four times now and it still hasn't gotten old for me.",1377734400,,604,4.252173913043478

of it's most horrific moments.  I changed the channel FAST and then checked to see the title so that I would never inadvertently watch it.

Creepy.....too creepy for me.

So, if you're reading this, you're looking for horror.  This might be right up your alley.",1356998400,,346,4.359375
5146079,3,B008B9JU76,A very low budget movie but quite good. The violence is over the top and way beyond anything I have ever seen. Similar to the zombie movies but with severely mentally ill patients. The ending can be a copy of Shutter Island or maybe not.,1355529600,,237,4.288888888888889
5146080,2,B008B9JU76,"[BEWARE: The following review of ""The Asylum Blackout"" contains minor spoilers.]

The title tells everything about the story. Well, apparently. In ""Asylum Blackout"" (aka ""The Incident"") George, an aspiring rock musician (Rupert Evans), is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum. One night, while working at the asylum's kitchen with his friends and band members Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy), there is a power failure due to a storm, and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates, who start attacking the guards.

Director Alexandre Court&egrave;s (his feature debut) takes time in setting up the character of George - serious-minded and short of sleep - and does it very well. George is very tired and clearly needs a rest, while the story unfolds from his viewpoint. George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate, but is it true?

""Asylum Blackout"" has a few violent and gory torture scenes, but as the film's bizarre conclusion suggests, it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror, something more psychological. While the dimly-lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George, there is also something wrong with the film's premise.

For, in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller, you need, besides atmospheric photography, better narrative skills in telling the story. While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum, we ask ourselves: how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates? Why do the police take such a long time to respond?

The film has potential for a more unnerving horror, but to create one you need a set-up that is more credible and intriguing.",1349913600,2,1814,5.177474402730375
5146081,1,B008B9JU76,"Opening credits lists an asylum in Washington State as the source and the date  of 11/6/89 of this patient breakout - sorry, despite the docudrama feel it never happened on that or any date and for that matter in any state. Our Belgium ""Tax Shelter for Films Investing"" studio must have played pin-the-tail-on-the-map as a site location for their fantasy tale. As for the script it's usually females that are picked by writers as victims who can only make dumb decisions while being implausibly ""no way out"" trapped by bad whatevers but in this case it's a rock band group (How could all of them have gotten the same cafeteria jobs at once?) having to defend themselves. The whole thing seemed contrived and as artificial as the blood. You have to be desperate to want to see red stuff (sort of since the lights were mostly out) to last through this one. The whole production seemed cheap. Must not be a lot of investors (they actually listed their names) seeking some tax sheltering.",1349308800,,984,4.687861271676301
5146082,4,B008B9JU76,"George and his fellow bad members pick up small gigs at night, while working at the asylum during the day. As cooks fot the criminaly insane, it is their job to prepare and serve the food for the inmates. With a less than ideal job, the group is hoping to make it big sometime soon and leave the asylum for good. Unfortunatly for them, the inmates have other ideas.

As a giant thunderstorm rolls through the town, the power at the asylum goes out. The lights don't turn on, the security doors are useless and the phones are dead. Reluctant at first, the cooks decide to restore order and bring the wandering inmates back to their cells. George and his friends soon realize the inmates my be insane, but they are not stupid. With an almost methodical plan of attack, the prisoners slowly begin to take over the darkened asylum. Armed with whatever they can find, the criminaly insane hunt down the gaurds and cooks, all while inflicting some serious pain.

The overall production was seemless. The cimematography is absolutely top notch as not one frame from this film is out of place. The picture perfect lighting and color tone found within this film emphasizes the detail and dedication that went into this production. The acting is seriously some of the best to come from a low budget film in a long time. Rupert Evans, the actor playing George, is the dominate acting force in the movie. His performance was is true, beleivalbe and without hesitation. Be on the look out for more from Evans.

IFC Midnight comes through big time with their release of Asylum Blackout. Director Alexandre Courtes delivers the scares and the gore in new and inventive ways. The blood is plentyful and the deaths are to die for. Along with the great direction, the superb camera work and acting ensures this 2012 horror/thriller hits on all cylinders.",1342569600,2,1836,4.713395638629284
5146083,4,B008B9JU76,"I had been juggling weather or not to purchase this movie for a few weeks now. The $6.99 price tag along with the fact that I didn't know any of the actors and it had only one review made me leery.  In the end the trailer was just too compelling so I figured I'd take the risk. I'm glad I did. The movie does a good job of setting the tone and conveying the general feeling of unease you'd expect to get from a mental hospital, along with a solid cast that comes off believable. An excellent thriller with just a dash of good horror. I'd give it 5 stars except that it didn't have a strong enough finish in my opinion.",1338163200,,618,4.065573770491803

8526574,5,B008B9JU76,"This is one of those films I started watching with fairly low expectations. I was surprised, however, by the opening minutes, as I was immediately drawn in by the natural dialogue, claustrophobic setting, and atmosphere of seething menace. The cinematography, music and narrative flow all possess the feel of a 1980's horror classic like Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Day of the Dead', with hints of Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13'.

While there's no doubt that the idea of being trapped inside an asylum for the criminally insane is scary, there is also a lot of ways to screw up a movie like this. Most films and TV shows in that tackle the 'lunatics take over the asylum' sub-genre do everything wrong, making the inmates more like cackling buffoons than monsters, tedious instead of frightening. Some of the lunatics in 'Asylum Blackout' cackle, but they're also absolutely terrifying. I've always believed that supernatural entities and monsters are far less frightening than the horrors people can and do inflict on one another. The thought of being trapped in a dark, windowless citadel, with just a handful of security and kitchen staff against dozens of murderous sociopaths and violently delusional psychotics, is enough to make the toughest men p*ss their pants.

The unpredictability of the insane is the motive force here, and it gains momentum quickly, never slowing down or second guessing the grisly twists and politically incorrect themes. This is one of those very rare occasions when I actually wanted to see more, and it's rarer still for me to feel that way about a horror film; endings are usually the weakest part of a horror movie. Asylum Blackout is not a true original, but it IS an anomaly, running contrary to the prevailing currents in horror; it's also a very good film, and anyone who considers themselves a fan of the genre should check it out.",1417478400,2,1884,4.94006309148265
8526575,3,B008B9JU76,"Black comedy/torture porn indie 'Asylum Blackout' (2011) boasts decent production values, a workable horror concept (complete with spooky setting and gallons of blood), and surprisingly credible performances.  Where it fails, though, is in the technical details, and there it fails pretty badly: bad lighting, bad editing, bad writing (whether it's overwritten or underwritten to the point of obscurity can be debated, but ultimately is irrelevant).  All sorts of potential mood-setting time at the outset is wasted on establishing the fact that our heroes-- a singularly luckless foursome working as kitchen staff in a home for the criminally insane-- are mates in a garage band of some kind (we never get to hear more than a few notes of the noise they produce), trying in their spare time to cut a demo record.  How does this dovetail with the plot, you ask?  It doesn't.  Probably just a conceit of the writer, producer, director or one of their girlfriends, so feel free to make a snack during most of act one.  The remainder of the film, at its best moments, plays out like 'Assault on Precinct 13' (1976) meets 'Day of the Dead' (1985) with a little mind-bending 'Brain Dead' (1990) peppered in.  Unfortunately it's shot like 'Alien 3,' only instead of interchangeable extraterrestrials whizzing by the camera in near-total darkness, they're human characters that presumably need to be differentiated in order for us to understand who's killing and who's dying.  Then there's the script, which is, thankfully, minimalist, but gives rather a half-hearted attempt at 'Die Hard' style survivalist technique (imagine the cast of 'Dazed and Confused' filling John McLane's shoes here), then quickly gives up, perhaps knowing that in the end everyone winds up in the bughouse.  Bottom line: there are brutal and disturbing sequences of bloodshed, torture and mayhem; an adequate amount of hide-and-seek suspense; and an enigmatic epilogue for those whose tastes run that way.  Otherwise, it's 85 minutes of formulaic chaos.  If you can take the good with the bad, 2 1/2 stars.",1393027200,,2077,5.151785714285714
8526576,1,B008B9JU76,"After hearing slurs in the beginning including the repeated use of ""retard"" made it harder to watch, & for the most part wasn't needed. It seems to be like constant swearing, it is a lot harder to think of other dialog than just the same few words many times, it can get annoying even for some not offended by them. The racist guard needed to show in some way, but it didn't seem like an nessisary addition?
 I didn't see the red picture or I would have been better prepared for the bloodbath, that's my fault. For me it was slow already, & then just seemed to get slower as they were running around seeing all the blood, bodies & people killed. Felt like the slowed down real time that they would feel. If you like all the gore, & don't mind the derogitory beggining, you might like it, but for others, there seems to be no suspence, or surprises really, aside from graphic deaths that couldn't have been guessed or imagined by many, it's all pretty predictable. I hoped for an ending that might have been worth seeing, but for me, I wish I hadn't wasted my time.",1389657600,,1064,4.346733668341709

Asylum Blackout

For the first hour I could see giving this a 5-star rating.  but a little after an hour it changes and then fails.  First hour plus was a tight story where a wanna-be rock group has their day job as cooks in a high security insane asylum.  There's good characterization, filming, acting, pass, everything.  Even through the beginning of the black out.  Then, it seems, the writer couldn't figure where to go [or maybe he/she died and an inept person took over].  So, for a few minutes he/she said: ""torture film! Yeah, that's the ticket.""  But then it dawned on him/her: ""I don't want to make a torture film.""  By this time they'd killed off too many people.  Thus the finish is... [wait for it]... ""I can't process this, that crazy man got in my brain.""  And then it should have finished with Alice Cooper singing: ""We're all crazy.  Crazy, crazy, ...crazy""  [From Alice's album: ""From the inside""]
  Anyhow, I could see inviting a bunch of friends over, at an hour stopping the film, [not talking about it, yet], and going out to eat.  After the meal discussing what has taken place and where it should go.  Go back watch the rest and then discuss how they failed and try to answer: ""WHY?!""  The first hour is really good.",1385683200,2,1316,4.504237288135593
