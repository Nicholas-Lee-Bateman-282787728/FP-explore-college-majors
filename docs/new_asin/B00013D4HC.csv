1968627,1,B00013D4HC,This movie really stinks and the pool shooting what there is of it really stinks. This movie is not worth the film is was put on and any APA member could beat anyone of these guys on a table.,1211068800,4,191,3.923076923076923
1968628,2,B00013D4HC,"My husband said it was an okay movie. But he's only watched it once since over a year ago when I got it for him. He said it was similar to some other movie he saw once, and the other movie was better. (if he remembers the name of the other movie I'll edit this and add the title)",1209340800,3,279,3.7457627118644066
1968629,3,B00013D4HC,"Decent beer-swilling fare. Some acceptable laughs. But alas, the pool shooting is weak; if you're gonna call it Stickmen, let's see some shots as good as the Hustler or Color Of Money, please.
A guy's flick, and not a bad one. But not a very good one either.
Rack 'em up again.",1203292800,,277,4.346153846153846
1968630,3,B00013D4HC,"I found this movie to be more of a comedy than a drama. The pool matches were set up more like the APA/TAP League than your ordinary 1-vs-1 tournament style matches. Never-the-less, my 3 star rating is directed on the plot of the movie and not on the actual pool shooting or the footage of the shots.",1184630400,,300,4.280701754385965
1968631,2,B00013D4HC,"I was hoping this was going to be another awesome movie with great pool shots like ""Poolhall Junkies"" but if you're looking for that kind of movie from""Stickmen"" then this is not the movie for you. Most of the pool table scenes are cut away camera shots, that is you see the player line up his shot and shoot and then the camera cuts to the view of the ball going into the pocket, so you can be pretty sure these guys can't play pool. Unfortunately neither can the director as he left two scenes in where the players clearly make push shot fouls on the cue ball. Seems the movie is more about the rules of pool and how they apply to your life, that is if your life is about beers, bars, and shagging. As one reviewer said the theme of the movie is old, and I found the acting, filming, and pool playing mediocrity at best. The only redeeming feature is the part played by Kirk Torrance who is cast in the role of narrator/quasi-villian which is why I gave this movie a two.",1159315200,10,973,4.208556149732621
1968632,2,B00013D4HC,"They botched this DVD release something fierce, it's a 4:3 Pan & Scan copy with Dolby 2.0 Surround, while Region 2 and Region 4 got nice 16:9 widescreen release with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, Commentary track, behind the scenes footage and more for HALF THE PRICE!!! 9.99 EUR which is $12.93 at time of writing this.

If you can import the R2 or R4 version it's worth it. This version was a disappointment.

I love the movie, but way to let me down Monarch Video.",1100476800,28,471,4.465116279069767
1968633,2,B00013D4HC,"This movie was pretty good. But it's impossible to NOT compare to Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. It's basically the same thing. Lock, Stock involved poker, Snatch had boxing, and this one is about pool. All of them with your stereo-type gangster that is trying to screw the heroes out of money and at the same type keep 'em down so they know who is boss. Eventually I'll buy this one, just have a bunch ahead in the list.",1091404800,13,439,4.365853658536586
1968634,5,B00013D4HC,"This film was just cool, It just oozed with its own self confidence. never being shy to do soemthing differnt. Its basically about 3 guys who get dragged into a Pool competition by some gangster. The 3 main characters are superb. The actors all seem to have the x factor especially the main character. you just cant keep your eyes off him when hes on the screen. Its funny, slick and differnt. If you liked lock stock or snatch. You will love this.",1082246400,10,448,4.409638554216867
1968635,5,B00013D4HC,"**Great movie from New Zealand about pool, mates (buddies for the Yanks), drinking, sex and a tournament with a little gangster action taboot.  Thoroughly enjoyed the cast - nice NOT to see any Hollywood types.  If you love pool, you'll love this movie - even if you don't love pool, it is worth seeing.
Kirk Torrance is soooooo cool - another one of those smoldering, intensely charasmatic men.
Soundtrack is perfect - wish it was available to purchase!
**Watch for the magic 8 ball!**",1079308800,4,486,4.773809523809524
8005835,5,B00013D4HC,Saw this movie over 10 years ago.  Could not find it anywhere. Until today.  It's sort of a Reservoir Dogs meets Snatch movie.,1524009600,,126,4.434782608695652

8005839,1,B00013D4HC,"I hate it because I couldn't watch it. I am a little hard of hearing. There are NO subtitles and the actors are all speaking in toung (with an accent)
Could not understand a word. I'm gonna try using headphones to see if it helps. If it does, I may just change my opinion of the movie.",1467244800,,285,4.017543859649122
8005840,4,B00013D4HC,IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE AN EXCITING MOVIE ABOUT BILLIARDS BUT THIS ONE DOES VERY WELL.,1458518400,,91,4.411764705882353
8005841,5,B00013D4HC,"Love the movie, glad to have it in my collection.  Packaged well and delivered in a timely manner.  Thanks again.",1417478400,,113,4.6
8005842,3,B00013D4HC,If you like Pool or anything pool related movie is worth checking out. There aren't too many Billiards movies out. This movie was made in New Zealand. At first the Aussie/Zealand accent was a bit weird but then I adjusted. This appears to be a low budget type of deal but its pretty well made an Directed. I think its worth a watch an enjoyed it enough. Im not a big movie person but i have watched it 3 times in past 7 or 8 months. That's a rarity for me as i cant normally stand watching a movie more than once.,1313020800,,513,4.03921568627451
8005843,5,B00013D4HC,"I ACTUALLY RENTED THIS MOVIE YEARS AGO JUST BECAUSE I HAD SEEN MOST OTHER NEW RELEASES. I HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT, BUT I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A SHOT. IT'S NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME. I ENDED UP BYING A COPY FROM THE VIDEO RENTAL PLACE. UNFORTUNATELY, I LET SOMEONE BORROW IT AND NEVER GOT IT BACK...BOLLOCKS! NO WORRIES, MATE, I JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE.",1260489600,,365,4.228571428571429
8005844,2,B00013D4HC,"Coming into this film I had higher expectations, especially when it was compared with Lock Stock & Two Smokin Barrels. Being an avid pool player I wanted to see something somewhat realistic. The shots of the pool action weren't very convincing and when they were shooting they were very simple straight in shots. The story as a whole wasn't well put together; after 30 minutes into the film, I was still waiting for something to happen. The storyline jumped around too much. Sad to say it was like a pool movie butchered by Hollywood and then reborn into a New Zealand film market. Furthermore, the pan and scan drove me crazy!! The only redemption to this film was the fact that I bought it for like 2.59 or something like that from an Amazon seller. Sorry, but I don't believe this film can compete with the classic pool films like The Color of Money, Poolhall Junkies, and the Hustler. I would say only watch it if you have 90 minutes of nothing else to do. I'm saving your butt at my expense...",1238198400,3,998,4.489010989010989
